  <h2>I. &mdash; RECONSTRUCTION</h2>

  <p>The two men stood upon the top of a bank bordering the rough road which
  led to the sea. They were listening to the lark, which had risen fluttering
  from their feet a moment or so ago, and was circling now above their heads.
  Mannering, with a quiet smile, pointed upwards.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There, my friend!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You can listen now to
  arguments more eloquent than any which I could ever frame. That little
  creature is singing the true, uncorrupted song of life. He sings of the
  sunshine, the buoyant air; the pure and simple joy of existence is beating in
  his little heart. The things which lie behind the hills will never sadden
  him. His kingdom is here, and he is content.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean&rsquo;s smile was a little cynical. He was essentially of that
  order of men who are dwellers in cities, and even the sting of the salt
  breeze blowing across the marshes&mdash;marshes riven everywhere with long
  arms of the sea&mdash;could bring no colour to his pale cheeks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your little bird&mdash;a lark, I think you called it,&rdquo; he
  remarked, &ldquo;may be a very eloquent prophet for the whole kingdom of his
  species, but the song of life for a bird and that for a man are surely
  different things!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so very different after all,&rdquo; Mannering answered, still
  watching the bird. &ldquo;The longer one lives, the more clearly one
  recognizes the absolute universality of life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean shrugged his shoulders, with a little gesture of impatience. He
  had left London at a moment when he could ill be spared, and had not
  travelled to this out-of-the-way corner of the kingdom to exchange
  purposeless platitudes with a man whose present attitude towards life at any
  rate he heartily despised. He seated himself upon a half-broken rail, and lit
  a cigarette.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mannering,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I did not come here to simper
  cheap philosophies with you like a couple of schoolgirls. I have a real live
  errand. I want to speak to you of great things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering moved a little uneasily. He had a very shrewd idea as to the
  nature of that errand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of great things,&rdquo; he repeated slowly. &ldquo;Are you in
  earnest, Borrowdean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Mannering continued, &ldquo;I have left the world
  of great things, as you and I used to regard them, very far behind. I am glad
  to see you here, of course, but I cannot think of any serious subject which
  it would be useful or profitable for us to discuss. You understand me,
  Borrowdean, I am sure!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean closely eyed this man who once had been his friend.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The old sore still rankles, then, Mannering,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;Has time done nothing to heal it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering laughed easily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How can you think me such a child?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;If
  Rochester himself were to come to see me he would be as welcome as you are.
  In fact,&rdquo; he continued, more seriously, &ldquo;if you could only
  realize, my friend, how peaceful and happy life here may be, amongst the
  quiet places, you would believe me at once when I assure you that I can feel
  nothing but gratitude towards those people and those circumstances which
  impelled me to seek it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What should you think, then,&rdquo; Borrowdean asked, watching his
  friend through half-closed eyes, &ldquo;of those who sought to drag you from
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering&rsquo;s laugh was as free and natural as the wind itself. He had
  bared his head, and had turned directly seawards.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hatred, my dear Borrowdean,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;if I thought
  that they had a single chance of success. As it
  is&mdash;indifference.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean&rsquo;s eyebrows were raised. He held his cigarette between his
  fingers, and looked at it for several moments.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yet I am here,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;for no other
  purpose.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering turned and faced his friend.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All I can say is that I am sorry to hear it,&rdquo; he declared.
  &ldquo;I know the sort of man you are, Borrowdean, and I know very well that
  if you have come down here with something to say to me you will say it.
  Therefore go on. Let us have it over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean stood up. His tone acquired a new earnestness. He became at
  once more of a man. The cynical curve of his lips had vanished.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are on the eve of great opportunities, Mannering,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;Six months ago the result of the next General Election seemed
  assured. We appeared to be as far off any chance of office as a political
  party could be. To-day the whole thing is changed. We are on the eve of a
  general reconstruction. It is our one great chance of this generation. I come
  to you as a patriot. Rochester asks you to forget.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering held up his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop one moment, Borrowdean,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want you to
  understand this once and for all. I have no grievance against Rochester. The
  old wound, if it ever amounted to that, is healed. If Rochester were here at
  this moment I would take his hand cheerfully. But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! There is a but, then,&rdquo; Borrowdean interrupted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is a but,&rdquo; Mannering assented. &ldquo;You may find it
  hard to understand, but here is the truth. I have lost all taste for public
  life. The whole thing is rotten, Borrowdean, rotten from beginning to end. I
  have had enough of it to last me all my days. Party policy must come before
  principle. A man&rsquo;s individuality, his whole character, is assailed and
  suborned on every side. There is but one life, one measure of days, that you
  or I know anything of. It doesn&rsquo;t last very long. The months and years
  have a knack of slipping away emptily enough unless we are always standing to
  attention. Therefore I think that it becomes our duty to consider very
  carefully, almost religiously, how best to use them. Come here for a moment,
  Borrowdean. I want to show you something.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The two men stood side by side upon the grassy bank, Mannering
  broad-shouldered and vigorous, his clean, hard-cut features tanned with wind
  and sun, his eyes bright and vigorous with health; Leslie Borrowdean, once
  his greatest friend, a man of almost similar physique, but with the bent
  frame and listless pallor of a dweller in the crowded places of life. Without
  enthusiasm his tired eyes followed the sweep of Mannering&rsquo;s arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You see those yellow sandhills beyond the marshes there? Behind
  them is the sea. Do you catch that breath of wind? Take off your hat, man,
  and get it into your lungs. It comes from the North Sea, salt and fresh and
  sweet. I think that it is the purest thing on earth. You can walk here for
  miles and miles in the open, and the wind is like God&rsquo;s own music.
  Borrowdean, I am going to say things to you which one says but once or twice
  in his life. I came to this country a soured man, cynical, a pessimist, a
  materialist by training and environment. To-day I speak of a God with bowed
  head, for I believe that somewhere behind all these beautiful things their
  prototype must exist. Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve turned ranter. I&rsquo;ve
  never spoken like this to any one else before, and I don&rsquo;t suppose I
  ever shall again. Here is Nature, man, the greatest force on earth, the
  mother, the mistress, beneficent, wonderful! You are a creature of cities.
  Stay with me here for a day or two, and the joy of all these things will
  steal into your blood. You, too, will know what peace is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean, as though unconsciously, straightened himself. If no colour
  came to his cheeks, the light of battle was at least in his eyes. This man
  was speaking heresies. The words sprang to his lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; he exclaimed, scornfully. &ldquo;Peace is for the
  dead. The last reward perhaps of a breaking heart. The life effective,
  militant, is the only possible existence for men. Pull yourself together,
  Mannering, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake. Yours is the <i>faineant</i> spirit of
  the decadent, masquerading in the garb of a sham primitivism. Were you born
  into the world, do you think, to loiter through life an idle worshipper at
  the altar of beauty? Who are you to dare to skulk in the quiet places, whilst
  the battle of life is fought by others?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Another lark had risen almost from their feet, and, circling its way
  upwards, was breaking into song. And below, the full spring tide was filling
  the pools and creeks with the softly flowing, glimmering sea- water. The
  fishing boats, high and dry an hour ago, were passing now seaward along the
  silvery way. All these things Mannering was watching with rapt eyes, even
  whilst he listened to his companion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the world can get on very well
  without me, and I have no need of the world. The battle that you speak
  of&mdash;well, I have been in the fray, as you know. The memory of it is
  still a nightmare to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean had the appearance of a man who sought to put a restraint upon
  his words. He was silent for a moment, and then he spoke very
  deliberately.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mannering,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do not think me wholly
  unsympathetic. There is a side of me which sympathises deeply with every word
  which you have said. And there is another which forces me to remind you
  again, and again, that we men were never born to linger in the lotos lands of
  the world. You do not stand for yourself alone. You exist as a unit of
  humanity. Think of your responsibilities. You have found for yourself a
  beautiful corner of the world. That is all very well for you, but how about
  the rest? How about the millions who are chained to the cities that they may
  earn their living pittance, whose wives and children fill the churchyards,
  the echoes of whose weary, never-ceasing cry must reach you even here? They
  are the people, the sufferers, fellow-links with you in the chain of
  humanity. You may stand aloof as you will, but you can never cut yourself
  wholly away from the great family of your fellows. You may hide from your
  responsibilities, but the burden of them will lie heavy upon your conscience,
  the poison will penetrate sometimes into your most jealously guarded
  paradise. We are of the people&rsquo;s party, you and I, Mannering, and I
  tell you that the tocsin has sounded. We need you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A shadow had fallen upon Mannering&rsquo;s face. Borrowdean was in
  earnest, and his appeal was scarcely one to be treated lightly. Nevertheless,
  Mannering showed no sign of faltering, though his tone was certainly
  graver.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Leslie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you speak like a prophet, but
  believe me, my mind is made up. I have taken root here. Such work as I can do
  from my study is, as it always has been, at your service. But I myself have
  finished with actual political life. Don&rsquo;t press me too hard. I must
  seem churlish and ungrateful, but if I listened to you for hours the result
  would be the same. I have finished with actual political life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean shrugged his shoulders despairingly. Such a man was hard to
  deal with.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mannering,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;you must not, you really
  must not, send me away like this. You speak of your written work. Don&rsquo;t
  think that I underestimate it because I have not alluded to it before. I
  myself honestly believe that it was those wonderful articles of yours in the
  <i>Nineteenth Century</i> which brought back to a reasonable frame of mind
  thousands who were half led away by the glamour of this new campaign. You
  kindled the torch, my friend, and you must bear it to victory. You bring me
  to my last resource. If you will not serve under Rochester, come
  back&mdash;and Rochester will serve under you when the time comes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering shook his head slowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish I could convince you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;once and for
  all, that my refusal springs from no such reasons as you seem to imagine. I
  would sooner sit here, with a volume of Pater or Meredith, and this west wind
  blowing in my face, than I would hear myself acclaimed Prime Minister of
  England. Let us abandon this discussion once and for all, Borrowdean. We have
  arrived at a cul-de-sac, and I have spoken my last word.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean threw his half-finished cigarette into the ever- widening creek
  below. It was characteristic of the man that his face showed no sign of
  disappointment. Only for several moments he kept silence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; Mannering said at last. &ldquo;Let us make our way
  back to the house. If you are resolved to get back to town to- night, we
  ought to be thinking about luncheon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Borrowdean said. &ldquo;I must return.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They started to walk inland, but they had taken only a few steps when they
  both, as though by a common impulse, stopped. An unfamiliar sound had broken
  in upon the deep silence of this quiet land. Borrowdean, who was a few paces
  ahead, pointed to the bend in the road below, and turned towards his
  companion with a little gesture of cynical amusement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;the invasion of modernity. Even
  your time-forgotten paradise, Mannering, has its civilizations, then. What an
  anachronism!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With a cloud of dust behind, and with the sun flashing upon its polished
  metal parts, a motor car swung into sight, and came rushing towards them.
  Borrowdean, always a keen observer of trifles, noticed the change in
  Mannering&rsquo;s face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a neighbour of mine,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;She is on her
  way to the golf links.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Golf links!&rdquo; Borrowdean exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Mannering nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Behind the sandhills there,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

  <p>There was a grinding of brakes. The car came to a standstill below. A
  woman, who sat alone in the back seat, raised her veil and looked
  upwards.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am I late?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Clara has gone on&mdash;they
  told me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She had addressed Mannering, but her eyes seemed suddenly drawn to
  Borrowdean. As though dazzled by the sun, she dropped her veil. Borrowdean
  was standing as though turned to stone, perfectly rigid and motionless. His
  face was like a still, white mask.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am so sorry,&rdquo; Mannering said, &ldquo;but I have had a most
  unexpected visit from an old friend. May I introduce Sir Leslie
  Borrowdean&mdash;Mrs. Handsell!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The lady in the car bent her head, and Borrowdean performed an automatic
  salute. Mannering continued:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid that I must throw myself upon your mercy! Sir Leslie
  insists upon returning this afternoon, and I am taking him back for an early
  luncheon. You will find Clara and Lindsay at the golf club. May we have our
  foursome to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly! I will not keep you for a moment. I must hurry now, or
  the tide will be over the road.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She motioned the driver to proceed, but Borrowdean interposed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mannering,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am afraid that the poison of
  your lotos land is beginning to work already. May I stay until to-morrow and
  walk round with you whilst you play your foursome? I should enjoy it
  immensely.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering looked at his friend for a moment in amazement. Then he laughed
  heartily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By all means!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Our foursome stands, then,
  Mrs. Handsell. This way, Borrowdean!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The two men turned once more seaward, walking in single file along the top
  of the grassy bank. The woman in the car inclined her head, and motioned the
  driver to proceed.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b102"
     name="ref-b102"></a>II. &mdash; THE WOMAN WITH AN ALIAS</h2>

  <p>Borrowdean seemed after all to take but little interest in the game. He
  walked generally, some distance away from the players, on the top of the low
  bank of sandhills which fringed the sea. He was one of those men whom
  solitude never wearies, a weaver of carefully thought-out schemes, no single
  detail of which was ever left to chance or impulse. Such moments as these
  were valuable to him. He bared his head to the breeze, stopped to listen to
  the larks, watched the sea-gulls float low over the lapping waters, without
  paying the slightest attention to any one of them. The instinctive cunning
  which never deserted him led him without any conscious effort to assume a
  pleasure in these things which, as a matter of fact, he found entirely
  meaningless. It led him, too, to choose a retired spot for those periods of
  intensely close observation to which he every now and then subjected his host
  and the woman who was now his partner in the game. What he saw entirely
  satisfied him. Yet the way was scarcely clear.</p>

  <p>They caught him up near one of the greens, and he stood with his hands
  behind him, and his eyeglass securely fixed, gravely watching them approach
  and put for the hole. To him the whole performance seemed absolutely idiotic,
  but he showed no sign of anything save a mild and genial interest. Clara,
  Mannering&rsquo;s niece, who was immensely impressed with him, lingered
  behind.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you really care for any games at all, Sir
  Leslie?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know that you think me a barbarian,&rdquo; he remarked,
  smiling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;that is probably what
  you think us. I suppose they are really a waste of time when one has other
  things to do! Only down here, you see, there is nothing else to
  do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked at her thoughtfully. He had never yet in his life spoken half a
  dozen words with man, woman or child without wondering whether they might not
  somehow or other contribute towards his scheme of life. Clara Mannering was
  pretty, and no doubt foolish. She lived alone with her uncle, and possibly
  had some influence over him. It was certainly worth while.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not know you nearly well enough, Miss Mannering,&rdquo; he
  said, smiling, &ldquo;to tell you what I really think. But I can assure you
  that you don&rsquo;t seem a barbarian to me at all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was suddenly grave. It was her turn to play a stroke. She examined the
  ball, carefully selected a club from her bag, and with a long, easy swing
  sent it flying towards the hole.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>

  <p>She looked up at him and laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me what you are thinking,&rdquo; she insisted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That if I played golf,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I should like to
  be able to play like that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you must have played games sometimes,&rdquo; she insisted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When I was at Eton&mdash;&rdquo; he murmured.</p>

  <p>Mannering looked back, smiling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was in the Eton Eleven, Clara, and stroked his boat at college.
  Don&rsquo;t you believe all he tells you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall not believe another word,&rdquo; she declared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mean it,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;or I
  must remain dumb.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You want to go off and tramp along the ridges by yourself,&rdquo;
  she declared. &ldquo;Confess!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I should like to carry
  that bag for you and hand out the&mdash;er&mdash;implements.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She unslung it at once from her shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have rushed upon your fate,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now let me
  fasten it for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is there any remuneration?&rdquo; he inquired, anxiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mercenary person! Stand still now, I am going to play. Well,
  what do you expect?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not acquainted with the usual charges,&rdquo; he answered,
  &ldquo;but to judge from the weight of the clubs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give me them back, then,&rdquo; she cried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he declared, firmly, &ldquo;would induce me to
  relinquish them. I will leave the matter of remuneration entirely in your
  hands. I am convinced that you have a generous disposition.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The usual charge,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;is tenpence, and
  twopence for lunch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will take it in kind!&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>She laughed gaily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give me a mashie, please.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He peered into the bag.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which of these clubs now,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;rejoices in that
  weird name?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She helped herself, and played her shot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; she said, firmly, &ldquo;of paying
  the full price to a caddie who doesn&rsquo;t know what a mashie
  is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will be thankful,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;for whatever you may
  give me&mdash;even if it should be that carnation you are wearing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is worth more than tenpence,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps by extra diligence,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;I might
  deserve a little extra. By the bye, why does your partner, Mr. Lindsay,
  isn&rsquo;t it, walk by himself all the time?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He probably thinks,&rdquo; she answered, demurely, &ldquo;that I am
  too familiar with my caddie.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will understand,&rdquo; he said, earnestly, &ldquo;that if my
  behaviour is not strictly correct it is entirely owing to ignorance. I have
  no idea as to the exact position a caddie should take up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a pity you are going away so soon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
  might have given you lessons.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tempt me,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;I can assure you
  that without me the constitution of this country would collapse within a
  week.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at him&mdash;properly awed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a wonderful person you are!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; he said, meekly, &ldquo;that you are beginning to
  appreciate me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As a caddie,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;you are not, I must
  confess, wholly perfect. For instance, your attention should be entirely
  devoted to the person whose clubs you are carrying, instead of which you talk
  to me and watch Mrs. Handsell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was almost taken aback. For a pretty girl she was really not so much of
  a fool as he had thought her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I deny it <i>in toto</i>!&rdquo; he declared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, but I know you,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You are a
  politician, and you would deny anything. Don&rsquo;t you think her very
  handsome?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean gravely considered the matter, which was in itself a somewhat
  humorous thing. Slim and erect, with a long, graceful neck, and a carriage of
  the head which somehow suggested the environment of a court, Mrs. Handsell
  was distinctly, even from a distance, a pleasant person to look upon. He
  nodded approvingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, she is good-looking,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Is she a
  neighbour of yours?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She has taken a house within a hundred yards of ours,&rdquo; Clara
  Mannering answered. &ldquo;We all think that she is delightful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is she a widow?&rdquo; Borrowdean asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I imagine so,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I have never heard her
  speak of her husband. She has beautiful dresses and things. I should think
  she must be very rich. Stand quite still, please. I must take great pains
  over this stroke.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A wild shot from Clara&rsquo;s partner a few minutes later resulted in a
  scattering of the little party, searching for the ball. For the first time
  Borrowdean found himself near Mrs. Handsell.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must have a few words with you before I go back,&rdquo; he said,
  nonchalantly.</p><a id="pic2"
        name="pic2"></a><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1202051h-images/ALostLeader02.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration 2">
  </div><br>

  <p>&ldquo;Say that you would like to try my motor car,&rdquo; she answered.
  &ldquo;What do you want here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I came to see Mannering.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor Mannering!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It would be,&rdquo; he remarked, smoothly, &ldquo;a mistake to
  quarrel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They separated, and immediately afterwards the ball was found. A little
  later on the round was finished. Clara attributed her success to the
  excellence of her caddie. Mrs. Handsell deplored a headache, which had put
  her off her putting. Lindsay, who was in a bad temper, declined an invitation
  to lunch, and rode off on his bicycle. The rest of the little party gathered
  round the motor car, and Borrowdean asked preposterous questions about the
  gears and the speeds.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you are really interested,&rdquo; Mrs. Handsell said, languidly,
  &ldquo;I will take you home. I have only room for one, unfortunately, with
  all these clubs and things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should be delighted,&rdquo; Borrowdean answered, &ldquo;but
  perhaps Miss Mannering&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Clara will look after me,&rdquo; Mannering interrupted, smiling.
  &ldquo;Try to make an enthusiast of him, Mrs. Handsell. He needs a hobby
  badly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They started off. She leaned back in her seat and pulled her veil
  down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not talk to me here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We shall have a
  quarter of an hour before they can arrive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean assented silently. He was glad of the respite, for he wanted to
  think. A few minutes&rsquo; swift rush through the air, and the car pulled up
  before a queer, old-fashioned dwelling house in the middle of the village. A
  smart maid-servant came hurrying out to assist her mistress. Borrowdean was
  ushered into a long, low drawing-room, with open windows leading out on to a
  trim lawn. Beyond was a walled garden bordering the churchyard.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Handsell came back almost immediately. Borrowdean, turning his head
  as she entered, found himself studying her with a new curiosity. Yes, she was
  a beautiful woman. She had lost nothing. Her complexion&mdash;a little
  tanned, perhaps&mdash;was as fresh and soft as a girl&rsquo;s, her smile as
  delightfully full of humour as ever. Not a speck of grey in her black hair,
  not a shadow of embarrassment. A wonderful woman!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The one thing which we have no time to do is to stand and look at
  one another,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;However, since you have tried to
  stare me out of countenance, what do you find?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I find you unchanged,&rdquo; he answered, gravely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Naturally! I have found a panacea for all the woes of life. Now
  what do you want down here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mannering!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course. But you won&rsquo;t get him. He declares that he has
  finished with politics, and I never knew a man so thoroughly in
  earnest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No man has ever finished with politics!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A platitude,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;As for Mannering, well,
  for the first few weeks I felt about him as I suppose you do now. I know him
  better now, and I have changed my mind. He is unique, absolutely unique! Do
  you think that I could have existed here for nearly two months without
  him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I inquire,&rdquo; Borrowdean asked, blandly, &ldquo;how much
  longer you intend to exist here with him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All my days&mdash;perhaps! He and this place together are an
  anchorage. Look at me! Am I not a different woman? I know you too well, my
  dear Leslie, to attempt your conversion, but I can assure you that I
  am&mdash;very nearly in earnest!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You interest me amazingly,&rdquo; he remarked, smiling. &ldquo;May
  I ask, does Mannering know you as Mrs. Handsell only?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is not the Garden of Eden. I may
  be the first, but others will come who will surely recognize you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must risk it,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

  <p>Borrowdean swung his eyeglass backwards and forwards. All the time he was
  thinking intensely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How long have you been here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very nearly two months,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Imagine
  it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quite long enough for your little idyll,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;Come, you know what the end of it must be. We need Mannering! Help
  us!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; she answered, coolly. &ldquo;You must do without him
  for the present.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are our natural ally,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;We need your
  help now. You know very well that with a slip of the tongue I could change
  the whole situation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Somehow,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I do not think that you are likely
  to make that slip.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;I begin to understand
  Mannering&rsquo;s firmness now. You are one of the ropes which hold him to
  this petty life&mdash;to this philandering amongst the flower-pots. You are
  one of the ropes I want to cut. Why not, indeed? I think that I could do
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you want a bribe?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want Mannering.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He can belong to you none the less for belonging to us
  politically.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Possibly! But I prefer him here. As a recluse he is adorable. I do
  not want him to go through the mill.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand his importance to us,&rdquo; Borrowdean
  declared. &ldquo;This is really no light affair. Rochester and Mellors both
  believe in him. There is no limit to what he might not ask.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He has told me a dozen times,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that he never
  means to sit in Parliament again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is no reason why he should not change his mind,&rdquo;
  Borrowdean answered. &ldquo;Between us, I think that we could induce
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Only I do not mean to
  try.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish I could make you understand,&rdquo; he said impatiently,
  &ldquo;that I am in deadly earnest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You threaten?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call it that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;I will tell him the
  truth myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;is all that I should dare to ask.
  He would come to us to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You used not to underrate me,&rdquo; she murmured, with a glance
  towards the mirror.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is no other man like Mannering,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He
  abhors any form of deceit. He would forgive a murderer, but never a
  liar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Leslie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as a friend&mdash;and a
  relative&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Neither counts,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;I am a
  politician.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She sat quite still, looking away from him. The peaceful noises from the
  village street found their way into the room. A few cows were making their
  leisurely mid-day journey towards the pasturage, a baker&rsquo;s cart came
  rattling round the corner. The west wind was rustling in the elms, bending
  the shrubs upon the lawn almost to the ground. She watched them idly, already
  a little shrivelled and tarnished with their endless struggle for life.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not wish to be melodramatic,&rdquo; she said, slowly,
  &ldquo;but you are forcing me into a corner. You know that I am rich. You
  know the people with whom I have influence. I want to purchase Lawrence
  Mannering&rsquo;s immunity from your schemes. Can you name no price which I
  could pay? You and I know one another fairly well. You are an egoist, pure
  and simple. Politics are nothing to you save a personal affair. You play the
  game of life in the first person singular. Let me pay his
  quittance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean regarded her thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are a strange woman,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In a few
  months&rsquo; time, when you are back in the thick of it all, you will be as
  anxious to have him there as we are. You will not be able to understand how
  you could ever have wished differently. This is rank sentiment, you know,
  which you have been talking. Mannering here is a wasted power. His life is an
  unnatural one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is happy,&rdquo; she objected.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you know? Will he be as happy, I wonder, when you have gone,
  when there is no longer a Mrs. Handsell? I think not! You are one of the
  first to whom I should have looked for help in this matter. You owe it to us.
  We have a right to demand it. For myself personally I have no life now
  outside the life political. I am tired of being in opposition. I want to hold
  office. One mounts the ladder very slowly. I see my way in a few months to
  going up two rungs at a time. We want Mannering. We must have him.
  Don&rsquo;t force me to make that slip of the tongue.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The sound of a gong came through the open window. She rose to her
  feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are keeping them waiting for luncheon,&rdquo; she remarked.
  &ldquo;I will think over what you have said.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b103"
     name="ref-b103"></a>III. &mdash; WANTED&mdash;A POLITICIAN</h2>

  <p>Sir Leslie carefully closed the iron gate behind him, and looked
  around.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But where,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;are the roses?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Clara laughed outright.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You may be a great politician, Sir Leslie,&rdquo; she declared,
  &ldquo;but you are no gardener. Roses don&rsquo;t bloom out of doors in
  May&mdash;not in these parts at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he assented, humbly. &ldquo;This is where the
  roses will be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That wall, you see,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;keeps off the
  north winds, and the chestnut grove the east. There is sun here all the day
  long. You should come to Blakely in two months&rsquo; time, Sir Leslie.
  Everything is so different then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He sighed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You forget, my dear child,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;that you are
  speaking to a slave.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A slave!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;How absurd! You are a Cabinet
  Minister, are you not, Sir Leslie?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was once,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;until an ungrateful country
  grew weary of the monotony of perfect government and installed our opponents
  in our places. Just now we are in opposition.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In opposition,&rdquo; she repeated, a little vaguely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Meaning,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;that we get all the fun, no
  responsibility, and, alas, no pay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How fascinating,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Do sit down here, and
  tell me all about it. But I forgot. You are not used to sitting down out of
  doors. Perhaps you will catch cold.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir Leslie smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am inclined to run the risk,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;if
  you will share it. Seriously, though, these rustic seats are rather a
  delusion, aren&rsquo;t they, from the point of view of comfort?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There shall be cushions,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;for the next
  time you come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He sighed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, the next time! I dare not look forward to it. So you are
  interested in politics, Miss Mannering?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I believe I am,&rdquo; she answered, a little doubtfully.
  &ldquo;To tell you the truth, Sir Leslie, I am shockingly ignorant. You must
  live in London to be a politician, mustn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is necessary,&rdquo; he assented, &ldquo;to spend some part of
  your time there, if you want to come into touch with the real
  thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I am very interested in politics,&rdquo; she declared.
  &ldquo;Please go on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would rather you talked to me about the roses. You should ask
  your uncle to tell you all about politics. He knows far more than I
  do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;More than you! But you have been a Cabinet Minister!&rdquo; she
  exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So was your uncle once,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;So he could be
  again whenever he chose.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at him incredulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really mean that, Sir Leslie?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed I do!&rdquo; he asserted. &ldquo;There was never a man
  within my recollection or knowledge who in so short a time made for himself a
  position so brilliant as your uncle. There is no man to-day whose written
  word carries so much weight with the people.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She sighed a little doubtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then if that is so,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I cannot imagine why we
  live down here, hundreds of miles away from everywhere. Why did he give it
  up? Why is he not in Parliament now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is to ask him that question, Miss Mannering,&rdquo; Borrowdean
  said, &ldquo;that I am here. No wonder it seems surprising to you. It is
  surprising to all of us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at him eagerly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean, then, that you&mdash;that his party want him to go
  back?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have told him this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course! It was my mission!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir Leslie, you must tell me what he said.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean sighed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear young lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is rather a painful
  subject with me just now. Yet since you insist, I will tell you. Something
  has come over your uncle which I do not understand. His party&mdash;no, it is
  his country that needs him. He prefers to stay here, and watch his roses
  blossom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is wicked of him!&rdquo; she declared, energetically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is inexplicable,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;Yet I have used every
  argument which can well be urged.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you must think of others,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;If you knew
  how weary one gets of this place&mdash;a man, too, like my uncle! How can he
  be content? The monotony here is enough to drive even a dull person like
  myself mad. To choose such a life, actually to choose it, is
  insanity!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean raised his head. He had heard the click of the garden gate.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are coming,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wish you would talk to
  your uncle like this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I only wish,&rdquo; she answered, passionately, &ldquo;that I could
  make him feel as I do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They entered the garden, Mannering, bareheaded, following his guest.
  Borrowdean watched them closely as they approached. The woman&rsquo;s
  expression was purely negative. There was nothing to be learned from the
  languid smile with which she recognized their presence. Upon Mannering,
  however, the cloud seemed already to have fallen. His eyebrows were set in a
  frown. He had the appearance of a man in some manner perplexed. He carried
  two telegrams, which he handed over to Borrowdean.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A boy on a bicycle,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;is waiting for
  answers. Two telegrams at once is a thing wholly unheard of here, Borrowdean.
  You really ought not to have disturbed our postal service to such an
  extent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean smiled as he tore them open.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I can guess their contents.
  Yes, I thought so. Can you send me to the station, Mannering?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&mdash;if it is necessary,&rdquo; Mannering answered.
  &ldquo;Must you really go?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must be in the House to-night,&rdquo; he said, a little wearily.
  &ldquo;Rochester is going for them again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t take a pair?&rdquo; Mannering asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t altogether that,&rdquo; Borrowdean answered,
  &ldquo;though Heaven knows we can&rsquo;t spare a single vote just now.
  Rochester wants me to speak. We are a used-up lot, and no mistake. We want
  new blood, Mannering!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I trust that the next election,&rdquo; Mannering said, &ldquo;may
  supply you with it. Will you walk round to the stables with me? I must order
  a cart for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall be glad to,&rdquo; Borrowdean answered.</p>

  <p>They walked side by side through the chestnut grove. Borrowdean laid his
  hand upon his friend&rsquo;s arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mannering,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;am I to take it that you
  have spoken your last word? I am to write my mission down a
  failure?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A failure without doubt, so far as regards its immediate
  object,&rdquo; Mannering assented. &ldquo;For the rest, it has been very
  pleasant to see you again, and I only wish that you could spare us a few more
  days.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are better apart just now, Mannering,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for
  I tell you frankly that I do not understand your present attitude towards
  life&mdash;your entire absence of all sense of moral responsibility. Are you
  indeed willing to be written down in history as a philanderer in great
  things, to loiter in your flower gardens, whilst other men fight the battle
  of life for you and your fellows? Persist in your refusal to help us, if you
  will, Mannering, but before I go you shall at least hear the
  truth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be precise, my dear friend. I shall hear your view of the
  truth!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not accept the correction,&rdquo; Borrowdean answered,
  quickly. &ldquo;There are times when a man can make no mistake, and this is
  one of them. You shall hear the truth from me this afternoon, and when your
  days here have been spun out to their limit&mdash;your days of sybaritic
  idleness&mdash;you shall hear it again, only it will be too late. You are
  fighting against Nature, Mannering. You were born to rule, to be master over
  men. You have that nameless gift of genius&mdash;power&mdash;the gift of
  swaying the minds and hearts of your fellow men. Once you accepted your
  destiny. Your feet were firmly planted upon the great ladder. You could have
  climbed&mdash;where you would.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A curious quietness seemed to have crept over Mannering. When he answered,
  his voice seemed to rise scarcely above a whisper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was not worth
  while!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean was almost angry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not worth while,&rdquo; he repeated, contemptuously. &ldquo;Is it
  worth while, then, to play golf, to linger in your flower gardens, to become
  a dilettante student, to dream away your days in the idleness of a purely
  enervating culture? What is it that I heard you yourself say once&mdash;that
  life apart from one&rsquo;s fellows must always lack robustness. You have the
  instincts of the creator, Mannering. You cannot stifle them. Some day the cry
  of the world to its own children will find its echo in your heart, and it may
  be too late. For sooner or later, my friend, the place of all men on earth is
  filled.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For a moment that somewhat cynical restraint which seemed to divest of
  enthusiasm Borrowdean&rsquo;s most earnest words, and which militated
  somewhat against his reputation as a public speaker, seemed to have fallen
  from him. Mannering, recognizing it, answered him gravely enough, though with
  no less decision.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you are right, Borrowdean,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the suffering
  will be mine. Come, your time is short now. Perhaps you had better make your
  adieux to my niece and Mrs. Handsell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They all came out into the drive to see him start. A curious change had
  come over the bright spring day. A grey sea-fog had drifted inland, the
  sunlight was obscured, the larks were silent. Borrowdean shivered a little as
  he turned up his coat-collar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So Nature has her little caprices, even&mdash;in paradise!&rdquo;
  he remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It will blow over in an hour,&rdquo; Mannering said. &ldquo;A
  breath of wind, and the whole thing is gone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean&rsquo;s farewells were of the briefest. He made no further
  allusion to the object of his visit. He departed as one who had been paying
  an afternoon call more or less agreeable. Clara waved her hand until he was
  out of sight, then she turned somewhat abruptly round and entered the house.
  Mannering and Mrs. Handsell remained for a few moments in the avenue, looking
  along the road. The sound of the horse&rsquo;s feet could still be heard, but
  the trap itself was long since invisible.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The passing of your friend,&rdquo; she remarked, quietly, &ldquo;is
  almost allegorical. He has gone into the land of ghosts&mdash;or are we the
  ghosts, I wonder, who loiter here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering answered her without a touch of levity. He, too, was unusually
  serious.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have the better part,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yet Borrowdean is
  one of those men who know very well how to play upon the heartstrings. A
  human being is like a musical instrument to him. He knows how to find out the
  harmonies or strike the discords.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She turned away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am superstitious,&rdquo; she murmured, with a little shiver.
  &ldquo;I suppose that it is this ghostly mist, and the silence which has come
  with it. Yet I wish that your friend had stayed away from Blakely!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Upstairs from her window Clara also was gazing along the road where
  Borrowdean had disappeared. And Borrowdean himself was puzzling over a third
  telegram which Mannering had carelessly passed on to him with his own, and
  which, although it was clearly addressed to Mannering, he had, after a few
  minutes&rsquo; hesitation, opened. It had been handed in at the Strand
  Post-office.</p>

  <p class="telegram">&ldquo;I MUST SEE YOU THIS
  WEEK.&mdash;BLANCHE.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A few hours later, on his arrival in London, Borrowdean repeated this
  message to Mannering from the same post-office, and quietly tearing up the
  original went down to the House.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot tell,&rdquo; he reported to his chief, &ldquo;whether we
  have succeeded or not. In a fortnight or less we shall know.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b104"
     name="ref-b104"></a>IV. &mdash; THE DUCHESS ASKS A QUESTION</h2>

  <p>Clara stepped through the high French window, and with skirts a little
  raised crossed the lawn. Lindsay, who was following her, stopped to light a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting frightfully modern,&rdquo; she remarked,
  turning and waiting for him. &ldquo;Mrs. Handsell and I ought to have come
  out here, and you and uncle ought to have stayed and yawned at one another
  over the dinner- table.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have an excellent preceptress&mdash;in modernity,&rdquo; he
  remarked. &ldquo;May I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you mean smoke, of course you may,&rdquo; she answered.
  &ldquo;But you may not say or think horrid things about my best friend.
  She&rsquo;s a dear, wonderful woman, and I&rsquo;m sure uncle has not been
  like the same man since she came.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you appreciate that,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Do
  you honestly think he&rsquo;s any the better for it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s immensely improved,&rdquo; she answered.
  &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t grub about by himself nearly so much, and he&rsquo;s
  had his hair cut. I&rsquo;m sure he looks years younger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you think that he seems quite as contented?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Contented!&rdquo; she repeated, scornfully. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
  just like you, Richard. He hasn&rsquo;t any right to be contented. No one
  has. It is the one absolutely fatal state.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stretched himself out upon, the seat, and frowned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re picking up some strange ideas, Clara,&rdquo; he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, if I am, that&rsquo;s better than being contented to all
  eternity with the old ones,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Mrs. Handsell is doing
  us all no end of good. She makes us think! We all ought to think,
  Richard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What on earth for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are really hopeless,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;So
  bucolic&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;I seem to recognize the
  inspiration. I hate that woman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Richard!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I do!&rdquo; he persisted. &ldquo;When she first came she was
  all right. That fellow Borrowdean seems to have done all the
  mischief.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor Sir Leslie!&rdquo; she exclaimed, demurely. &ldquo;I thought
  him so delightful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Obviously,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. I hate a
  fellow who doesn&rsquo;t do things himself, and has a way of looking on which
  makes you feel a perfect idiot. Neither Mr. Mannering nor Mrs.
  Handsell&mdash;nor you&mdash;have been the same since he was here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I gather,&rdquo; she said, softly, &ldquo;that you do not find us
  improved.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; he answered, stolidly. &ldquo;Mrs. Handsell has
  begun to talk to you now about London, of the theatres, the dressmakers,
  Hurlingham, Ranelagh, race meetings, society, and all that sort of rot. She
  talks of them very cleverly. She knows how to make the tinsel sparkle like
  real gold.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are positively eloquent, Richard,&rdquo; she declared.
  &ldquo;Do go on!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then she goes for your uncle,&rdquo; he continued, without heeding
  her interruption. &ldquo;She speaks of Parliament, of great causes, of
  ambition, until his eyes are on fire. She describes new pleasures to you, and
  you sit at her feet, a mute worshipper! I can&rsquo;t think why she ever came
  here. She&rsquo;s absolutely the wrong sort of woman for a quiet country
  place like this. I wish I&rsquo;d never let her the place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are a very foolish person,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;She came
  here simply because she was weary of cities and wanted to get as far away
  from them as possible. Only last night she said that she would be content
  never to breathe the air of a town again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lindsay tossed his cigarette away impatiently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I know exactly her way of saying that sort of thing!&rdquo; he
  exclaimed. &ldquo;A moment later she would be describing very cleverly, and a
  little regretfully, some wonderful sight or other only to be found in
  London.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;I am getting afraid of you. You
  are more observant than I thought.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is one gift, at least,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;which we
  country folk are supposed to possess. We know truth when we see it. But I am
  saying more than I have any right to. I don&rsquo;t want to make you angry,
  Clara!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
  think you quite understand. Let me tell you something. You know that I am an
  orphan, don&rsquo;t you? I do not remember my father at all, and I can only
  just remember my mother. I was brought up at a pleasant but very dreary
  boarding-school. I had very few friends, and no one came to see me except my
  uncle, who was always very kind, but always in a desperate hurry. I stayed
  there until I was seventeen. Then my uncle came and fetched me, and brought
  me straight here. Now that is exactly what my life has been. What do you
  think of it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very dull indeed,&rdquo; he answered, frankly.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have never been in London at all,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I
  really only know what men and women are like from books, or the one or two
  types I have met around here. Now, do you think that that is enough to
  satisfy one? Of course it is very beautiful here, I know, and sometimes when
  the sun is shining and the birds singing and the sea comes up into the
  creeks, well, one almost feels content. But the sun doesn&rsquo;t always
  shine, Richard, and there are times when I am right down bored, and I feel as
  though I&rsquo;d love to draw my allowance from uncle, pack my trunk, and go
  up to London, on my own!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laughed. Somehow all that she had said had sounded so natural that some
  part of his uneasiness was already passing away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yours,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;is an extreme case. I really
  don&rsquo;t know why your uncle has never taken you up for a month or so in
  the season.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have lived here for four years,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and he
  has never once suggested it. He goes himself, of course, sometimes, but I am
  quite sure that he doesn&rsquo;t enjoy it. For days before he fidgets about
  and looks perfectly miserable, and when he comes back he always goes off for
  a long walk by himself. I am perfectly certain that for some reason or other
  he hates going. Yet he seems to have been everywhere, to know every one. To
  hear him talk with Mrs. Handsell is like a new Arabian Nights to
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your uncle was a very distinguished man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
  was only at college then, but I remember what a fuss there was in all the
  papers when he resigned his seat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What did they say was the reason?&rdquo; she asked, eagerly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A slight disagreement with Lord Rochester, and
  ill-health.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Absurd!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Uncle is as strong as a
  horse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you like him,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;to go back into
  political life?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her eyes sparkled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course I should.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You may have your wish,&rdquo; he said, a little sadly. &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t fancy he has been quite the same man since Sir Leslie Borrowdean
  was here, and Mrs. Handsell never leaves him alone for a moment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You talk as though they were conspirators!&rdquo; she
  exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is precisely what I believe them to be,&rdquo; he answered,
  grimly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Richard!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I will tell you
  something that I have no right to tell you. Mrs. Handsell is not your
  friend&rsquo;s real name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Richard, how exciting!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Do tell me how
  you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Her solicitors told mine so when she took the farm.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not her real name? But&mdash;I wonder they let it to
  her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, her references were all right,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;My
  people saw to that. I do not mean to insinuate for a moment that she had any
  improper reasons for calling herself Mrs. Handsell, or anything else she
  liked. The explanations given were quite satisfactory. But she has become
  very friendly with you and with your uncle, and I think that she ought to
  have told you both about it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know her real name?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No! It is not my affair. My solicitors knew, and they were
  satisfied. Perhaps I ought not to have told you this, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They are coming out. If you like you
  can take me down to the orchard wall, and we will watch the tide come
  in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering came out alone and looked around. The full moon was creeping
  into the sky. The breath of wind which shook the leaves of the tall elm trees
  that shut in his little demesne from the village, was soft, and, for the time
  of year, wonderfully mild. Below, through the orchard trees, were faint
  visions of the marshland, riven with creeks of silvery sea. He turned back
  towards the room, where red-shaded lamps still stood upon the white
  tablecloth, a curiously artificial daub of color after the splendour of the
  moonlit land.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The night is perfect,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Do you need a
  wrap, or are you sufficiently acclimatized?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She came out to him, tall and slender in her black dinner gown, the figure
  of a girl, the pale, passionate face of a woman, to whom every moment of life
  had its own special and individual meaning. Her eyes were strangely bright.
  There was a tenseness about her manner, a restraint in her tone, which seemed
  to speak of some emotional crisis. She passed out into the quiet garden, in
  itself so exquisitely in accordance with this sleeping land, and even
  Mannering was at once conscious of some alien note in these old- world
  surroundings which had long ago soothed his ruffled nerves into the luxury of
  repose.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A wrap!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;How absurd! Come and let us sit
  under the cedar tree. Those young people seem to have wandered off, and I
  want to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am content to listen,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It is a night
  for listeners, this!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want to talk,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;and yet&mdash;the
  words seem difficult. These wonderful days! How quickly they seem to have
  passed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are others to follow,&rdquo; he answered, smiling.
  &ldquo;That is one of the joys of life here. One can count on
  things!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Others for you!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;You have pitched your
  tent. I came here only as a wanderer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But scarcely a month ago,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you
  too&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;A month ago it seemed
  to me possible that I might live here always. I felt myself growing young
  again. I believed that I had severed all the ties which bound me to the days
  which have gone before. I was wrong. It was the sort of folly which comes to
  one sometimes, the sort of folly for which one pays.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His face was almost white in the moonlight. His deep- set grey eyes were
  fixed upon her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You were content&mdash;a month ago,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have
  been in London for two days, and you have come back a changed woman. Why must
  you think of leaving this place? Why need you go at all?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; she said, softly, &ldquo;I think that you know
  why. It is very beautiful here, and I have never been happier in all my life.
  But one may not linger all one&rsquo;s days in the pleasant places. One
  sleeps through the nights and is rested, but the days&mdash;ah, they are
  different.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot reason with you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are too vague.
  Yet&mdash;you say that you have been contented here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have been happy,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you must speak more plainly,&rdquo; he insisted, a note of
  passion throbbing in his hoarse tones. &ldquo;I ask you again&mdash;why do
  you talk of going back, like a city slave whose days of holiday are over?
  What is there in the world more beautiful than the gifts the gods shower on
  us here? We have the sun, and the sea, and the wind by day and by
  night&mdash;this! It is the flower garden of life. Stay and pluck the roses
  with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, my friend,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;if that were
  possible!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She sank down into the seat under the cedar tree. Her hands were clasped
  nervously together, her head was downcast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your words,&rdquo; she continued, her voice sinking almost to a
  whisper, yet lacking nothing in distinctness, &ldquo;are like wine. They
  mount to the head, they intoxicate, they tempt! And yet all the time one
  knows that it is not possible. Surely you yourself&mdash;in your
  heart&mdash;must know it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not I!&rdquo; he answered, fiercely. &ldquo;The world would have
  claimed me if it could, but I laughed at it. Our destinies are our own. With
  our own fingers we mould and shape them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is the little voice,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the little
  voice, which rings even through our dreams. Life&mdash;actual, militant life,
  I mean&mdash;may have its vulgarities, its weariness and its disappointments,
  but it is, after all, the only place for men and women. The battle may be
  sordid, and the prizes tinsel&mdash;yet it is only the cowards who linger
  without.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then let you and me be cowards,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;We shall
  at least be happy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head a little sadly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Happiness is a gift, not a
  prize. It comes seldom enough to those who seek it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not a seeker,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I possess. It seems to
  me that all the beautiful things of life are here to- night. Listen! Do you
  hear the sea, the full tide sweeping softly up into the land, a long drawn
  out undernote of breathless harmonies, the rustling of leaves there in the
  elm trees, the faint night wind, like the murmuring of angels? Lift your
  head! Was there anything ever sweeter than the perfume from that hedge of
  honeysuckle? What can a man want more than these
  things&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And the woman he loves! There, I have said it. Useless words
  enough! You know very well that I love you. I meant to have said nothing just
  yet, but who could help it&mdash;on such a night as this! Don&rsquo;t talk of
  going away, Berenice. I want you here always.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She held herself away from him. Her face was deathly white now. Her eyes
  questioned him fiercely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Before I answer you. You were in London last week?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had business.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In Chelsea, in Merton Street?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He gave a little gasp.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you know about that?&rdquo; he asked, almost roughly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You were seen there, not for the first time. The person whom you
  visited&mdash;I have heard about. She is somewhat notorious, is she
  not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was very quiet, pale to the lips. A strange, hunted expression had
  crept into his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want to know what took you there. Am I asking too much? Remember
  that you have asked me a good deal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has Borrowdean anything to do with this?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have known Sir Leslie Borrowdean for many years,&rdquo; she
  answered, &ldquo;and it is quite true that we have discussed certain
  matters&mdash;concerning you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have known Sir Leslie Borrowdean for many years,&rdquo; he
  repeated. &ldquo;Yet you met here as strangers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir Leslie divined my wishes,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;He knew
  that it was my wish to spend several months away from everybody, and, if
  possible, unrecognized. Perhaps I had better make my confession at once. My
  name is not Mrs. Handsell. I am the Duchess of Lenchester.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering stood as though turned to stone. The woman watched him eagerly.
  She waited for him to speak&mdash;in vain. A sudden mist of tears blinded
  her. She closed her eyes. When she opened them Mannering was gone.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b105"
     name="ref-b105"></a>V. &mdash; THE HESITATION OF MR. MANNERING</h2>

  <p>The peculiar atmosphere of the room, heavy with the newest perfume from
  the Burlington Arcade, and the scent of exotic flowers, at no time pleasing
  to him, seemed more than usually oppressive to Mannering as he fidgetted
  about waiting for the woman whom he had come to see. He was conscious of a
  restless longing to open wide the windows, take the flowers from their vases,
  throw them into the street, and poke out the fire. The little room, with all
  its associations, its almost pathetic attempts at refinement, its furniture
  which reeked of the Tottenham Court Road, was suddenly hateful to him. He
  detested his presence there, and its object. He was already in a state of
  nervous displeasure when the door opened.</p>

  <p>The girl who entered seemed in a sense as ill in accord with such
  surroundings as himself. She was plainly dressed in black, her hair brushed
  back, her complexion pale, her eyes brilliant with a not altogether natural
  light. She regarded him with a curious mixture of fear and welcome. The
  latter, however, triumphed easily. She came towards him with out- stretched
  hand and a delightful smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You;&mdash;so soon again!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Were
  there&mdash;so many mistakes?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering&rsquo;s face softened. He was half ashamed of his irritation. He
  answered her kindly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Scarcely any, Hester,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Your typing is
  always excellent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her anxiety was only half allayed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is nothing else wrong?&rdquo; she demanded, breathlessly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing whatever,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;Where is your
  mother?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She sat down. The light died out of her face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Out!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Gone to Brighton for the day. What
  do you want with her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he answered, gravely. &ldquo;I only wanted to know
  whether we were likely to be interrupted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She will not be in for some time,&rdquo; the girl answered.
  &ldquo;She is almost certain to stay down there and dine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hester,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;do you know any one&mdash;a man
  named Borrowdean? Sir Leslie Borrowdean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head a little doubtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have heard mother speak of him,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is a friend of hers, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She met him at a supper party at the Savoy a few weeks ago,&rdquo;
  she answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And since?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe so! She talks about him a great deal. Why do you ask me
  this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you, Hester,&rdquo; he said, gravely. &ldquo;By the
  bye, do you think that she is likely to have mentioned my name to
  him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl flushed up to her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know! I am sorry,&rdquo; she faltered.
  &ldquo;You know what mother is. If any one asked her questions she would be
  more than likely to answer them. I do hope that she has not been making
  mischief.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He left her anxiety unrelieved. For some few moments he did not speak at
  all. Already he fancied that he could see the whole pitiful little
  incident&mdash;Borrowdean, diplomatic, genial, persistent, the woman a fool,
  fashioned to his own making; himself the sacrifice. Yet the meaning of it all
  was dark to him.</p>

  <p>She moved over to his side. Her eyes and tone were full of appeal. She sat
  close to him, her long white fingers nervously interlocked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid of you. More afraid than ever to- day,&rdquo; she
  murmured. &ldquo;You look stern, and I don&rsquo;t understand why you have
  come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To see you, Hester,&rdquo; he answered, with a sudden impulse of
  kindness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, no!&rdquo; she interrupted, choking back a little sob.
  &ldquo;We both know so well that it is not that. It is pity which brings you,
  pity and nothing else. You know very well what a difference it makes to me.
  If I have your work to do, and a letter sometimes, and see you now and then,
  I can bear everything. But it is not easy. It is never easy!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course it is not,&rdquo; he assented. &ldquo;Hester, have you
  thought over what I said to you last time I was here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is the use of thinking?&rdquo; she asked, quietly. &ldquo;I
  could not leave her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean that she would not let you go?&rdquo; Mannering asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No! It is not that,&rdquo; the girl answered. &ldquo;Sometimes I
  think that she would be glad. It is not that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I understand. But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you understand, please do not say any more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I must, Hester,&rdquo; he persisted. &ldquo;There is no one
  else to give you advice. I know all that you can tell me, and I say that this
  is no fitting home for you. Your mother&rsquo;s friends are not fit friends
  for you. She has chosen her way in life, and she will not brook any
  interference. You can do no good by remaining with her. On the contrary, you
  are doing yourself a great deal of harm. I am old enough to be your father,
  child. Wise enough, I hope, to be your adviser. You shall be my secretary,
  and come and live at Blakely.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A faint flush stole into her an&aelig;mic. One realized then that under
  different conditions she might have been pretty. Her face was no longer
  expressionless.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are so kind,&rdquo; she said, softly. &ldquo;I shall always
  like to think of this. And yet&mdash;it is impossible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is difficult to explain,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But my being
  here makes a difference. I found it out once when I went away for a week.
  Some of&mdash;of mother&rsquo;s friends came to the house then whom she will
  not have when I am here. If I were away altogether&mdash;oh, I can&rsquo;t
  explain, but I would not dare to go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering seemed to have much to say&mdash;and said nothing. This queer,
  pale-faced girl, with her earnest eyes and few simple words, had silenced
  him. She was right&mdash;right at least from her own point of view. A certain
  sense of shame suddenly oppressed him. He was acutely conscious of his only
  half- admitted reason for this visit. He had argued for himself. It was his
  own passionate desire to free himself from associations that were little
  short of loathsome which had prompted this visit. And then what he had
  dreaded most of all happened. As they sat facing one another in the silent,
  half-darkened room, Mannering trying to bring himself into accord with
  half-admitted but repugnant convictions, she watching him hopelessly, the
  tinkle of a hansom bell sounded outside. The sudden stopping of a horse, the
  rattle of a latchkey, and she was in the room. Mannering rose to his feet
  with a little exclamation.</p>

  <p>The woman stood and looked in upon them. She wore a pink cloth gown, a
  flower-garlanded hat, a white coaching veil, beneath which her features were
  indistinguishable. She brought with her a waft of strong perfume. Her figure
  was a living suggestion of the struggle between maturity and the corseti&eacute;re.
  Before she spoke she laughed&mdash;not altogether pleasantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You here again!&rdquo; she exclaimed to Mannering. &ldquo;Upon my
  word! I&rsquo;m not a ghost! Hester, go and see about some tea, and a brandy
  and soda. Billy Foa brought me up on his motor, and I&rsquo;m half choked
  with dust.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl rose obediently and quitted the room. The woman untwisted her
  veil, drew out the pins from her hat, and threw both upon the sofa. Then she
  turned suddenly upon Mannering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the last twice you&rsquo;ve been
  here you seem to have carefully chosen times when I am out. I don&rsquo;t
  understand it. It can&rsquo;t be that you want to see that chit of a girl of
  mine. Why don&rsquo;t you come when I ask you? Why do you act as though I
  were something to be avoided?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I came to-day without knowing where you were,&rdquo; he answered,
  &ldquo;but I will admit that I wished to see Hester.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have asked her to come and live at Blakely with my niece and
  myself. She is an excellent typist, and I require a secretary.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The woman looked at him angrily. Without her veil she displayed features
  not in themselves unattractive, but a complexion somewhat impaired by the use
  of cosmetics. The powder upon her cheeks was even then visible.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What about me?&rdquo; she asked, sharply.</p>

  <p>Mannering looked her steadily in the face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that such a life would suit
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was an angry woman, and she did not become angry gracefully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean that I&rsquo;m not good enough for you and your friends in
  the country. That&rsquo;s what you mean, isn&rsquo;t it? And I should like to
  know, if I&rsquo;m not, whose fault it is. Tell me that, will you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering flinched, though almost imperceptibly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I meant simply what I said,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Blakely would
  not suit you at all. We have few friends there, and our simple life would not
  attract you in the slightest. With Hester it is different. She would have her
  work, in which she takes some interest, and I believe the change would be in
  every way good for her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, she shan&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; the woman said, throwing
  herself into a chair, and regarding him insolently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
  going to live all alone&mdash;and be talked about. Don&rsquo;t stare at me
  like that, Lawrence. I&rsquo;m the child&rsquo;s mother, am I not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is because you are her mother,&rdquo; he said, quietly,
  &ldquo;that I thought you might be glad to find a suitable home for
  her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s good enough for me ought to be good enough for
  her,&rdquo; she answered, doggedly.</p>

  <p>Mannering was silent for a moment. This woman seemed to belong to a
  different world from that with whose denizens he was in any way familiar.
  Years of isolation, and a certain epicureanism of taste, from which necessity
  had never taken the fine edge, had made him a little intolerant. He could see
  nothing that was not absolutely repulsive in this woman, whose fine eyes were
  seeking even now to attract his admiration. She was making the best of
  herself. She had chosen the darkest corner of the room, and her pose was not
  ungraceful. Her skirts were skilfully raised to show just as much as possible
  of her long, slender foot, with the patent shoes and silver buckles. She knew
  that her ankles were above reproach, and her dress becoming. A dozen men had
  paid her compliments during the day, yet she knew that every admiring glance,
  every whispered word which had come to her to-day, or for many days past,
  would count for nothing if only she could pierce for a single moment the
  unchanging coldness of the man who sat watching her now with the face of a
  Sphynx. A slow tide of passion welled up in her heart. Was not he a man and
  free, and was not she a woman? It was not much she asked from him, no pledge,
  no bondage. His kindness only, she told herself, was all she craved. She
  wanted him to look at her as other men looked at her. Who was he that he
  should set himself on a pedestal? Perhaps he had grown shy from the rust of
  his country life, the slow drifting apart from the world of men and women.
  Perhaps&mdash;she rose swiftly to her feet and crossed the room.</p>

  <p>She leaned over him, one hand on the back of his chair, the other seeking
  in vain for his.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lawrence,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you grow colder and more unkind
  every day. What have I done to change you so? I am a foolish woman, I know,
  but there are things which I cannot forget.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He rose at once to his feet, and stood apart from her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I believed that we understood one
  another.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am very sure that I do not understand you,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;And as for you&mdash;I do not believe that you have ever understood
  any woman. There was a time, Lawrence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His impassivity was gone. He threw out his hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is a promise between us.
  Don&rsquo;t break it. Don&rsquo;t dare to break it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at him curiously. A new idea concerning this man and his
  avoidance of her crept into her mind. It was at least consoling to her
  vanity, and it left her a chance. She had roused him too, at last, and that
  was worth something.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she asked, moving a step towards him. &ldquo;It was
  a foolish promise. It has done neither of us any good. It has spoilt a part
  of my life. Why should I keep silence, and let it go on to the end? Do you
  know what it has made of me, this promise?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shrank back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! I have done all I could!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All you could!&rdquo; she repeated, scornfully. &ldquo;You drew a
  diagram of your duty, and you have moved like a machine along the lines. You
  talk like a Pharisee, Lawrence! Come! You knew me years ago! Do you find me
  changed? Tell me the truth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;you are changed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You admit that. Perhaps, perhaps,&rdquo; she continued more slowly,
  &ldquo;there are things about me now of which you don&rsquo;t approve. My
  friends are a little fast, I go out alone, I daresay people have said things.
  There, you see I am very frank. I mean to be! I mean you to know that
  whatever I am, the fault is yours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are as God or the Devil made you,&rdquo; he answered, hardly.
  &ldquo;You are what you would have become, in any case.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lawrence!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Already he hated the memory of his words. True or not, they were spoken to
  a woman who was cowering under them as under a lash. He was at a disadvantage
  now. If she had met him with anger they might have cried quits. But he had
  seen her wince, seen her sudden pallor, and it was not a pleasant sight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I do not know quite what I am
  saying. You have broken a compact which I had hoped might have lasted all our
  days. Let us be better friends, if you will, but let us keep that promise
  which we made to one another.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was so many years ago,&rdquo; she said, in a low tone. &ldquo;I
  am afraid to think how many. It makes me lonely, Lawrence, to look ahead. I
  am afraid of growing old!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked at her steadily. Yes, the signs were there. She was a
  good-looking woman to-day, a handsome woman in some lights, but she had
  reached the limit. It was a matter of a few years at most, and then&mdash;He
  stood with his hands behind his back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a fear which we must all share,&rdquo; he said, quietly.
  &ldquo;The only antidote is work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Work!&rdquo; she repeated, scornfully. &ldquo;That is the
  man&rsquo;s resource. What about us? What about me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is no matter of sex,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;We all make our
  own choice. We are what we make of ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is not true,&rdquo; she answered, bluntly. &ldquo;Not with us,
  at any rate. We are what our menkind make of us. Oh, what cowards you all
  are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cowards?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. You do what mischief you choose, and then soothe your
  conscience with platitudes. You will take hold of pleasure with both hands,
  but your shoulders are not broad enough for the pack of responsibility.
  Don&rsquo;t look at me as though I were a mile off, Lawrence, as though this
  were simply an impersonal discussion. I am speaking to you&mdash;of you. You
  avoid me whenever you can. I don&rsquo;t often get a chance of speaking to
  you. You shall listen now. You live the life of a poet and a scholar, they
  tell me. You live in a beautiful home, you take care that nothing ugly or
  disturbing shall come near you. You are pleased with it, aren&rsquo;t you?
  You think yourself better than other men. Well, you are making a big mistake.
  A man doesn&rsquo;t have to answer for his own life only. He has to carry the
  burden of the lives his influence has wrecked and spoilt. I know just what
  you think of me. I am a middle-aged woman, clinging to my youth and
  pleasures&mdash;the sort of pleasures for which you have a vast contempt.
  There isn&rsquo;t an hour of my days of which you wouldn&rsquo;t disapprove.
  I&rsquo;m not your sort of woman at all. And yet I was all right once,
  Lawrence, and what I am now&mdash;&rdquo; she paused, &ldquo;what I am
  now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hester came in, followed by a maid with the tea-tray. She looked from one
  to the other a little anxiously. The atmosphere of the room seemed charged
  with electricity. Mannering&rsquo;s face was grey. Her mother was nervously
  crumpling into a ball her tiny lace handkerchief. Mrs. Phillimore rose
  abruptly from her seat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you got the brandy and soda, Hester?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I forgot it, mother,&rdquo; the girl answered.
  &ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t I make you some Russian tea? I&rsquo;ve had the lemon
  sliced.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The woman laughed, a little unnaturally.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a dutiful daughter,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
  right! I want looking after, don&rsquo;t I? I&rsquo;ll have the tea, Hester,
  but send it up to my room. I&rsquo;m going to lie down. That wretched
  motoring has given me a headache, and I&rsquo;m dining out to-night.
  Good-bye, Mr. Mannering, if I don&rsquo;t see you again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded, without glancing in his direction, and left the room. The maid
  arranged the tea-tray and departed. Hester showed no signs of being aware
  that anything unusual had happened. She made a little desultory conversation.
  Mannering answered in monosyllables.</p>

  <p>When at last he put his cup down he rose to go.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are quite sure, Hester,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have made up
  your mind?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She, too, rose, and came over to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know that I am right,&rdquo; she answered, quietly. &ldquo;The
  life you offer me would be paradise, but I dare not even think of it. I may
  not do any good here, perhaps I don&rsquo;t, but I can&rsquo;t come
  away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are a true daughter of your sex,&rdquo; he said, smiling.
  &ldquo;The keynote of your life must be sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps we are not so unwise, after all,&rdquo; she answered,
  &ldquo;for I think that there are more happy women in the world than
  men.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are more, I think, who deserve to be, dear,&rdquo; he
  answered, holding her hand for a moment. &ldquo;Good- bye!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering walked in somewhat abstracted fashion to the corner of the
  street, and signalled for a hansom. With his foot upon the step he
  hesitated.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b107"
     name="ref-b107"></a>VII. &mdash; THE DUCHESS&rsquo;S &ldquo;AT
     HOME&rdquo;</h2>

  <p>&ldquo;The perfect man,&rdquo; the Duchess murmured, as she stirred her
  tea, &ldquo;does not exist. I know a dozen perfect women, dear, dull
  creatures, and plenty of men who know how to cover up the flaw. But there is
  something in the composition of the male sex which keeps them always a little
  below the highest pinnacle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is purely a matter of concealment,&rdquo; her friend declared.
  &ldquo;Women are cleverer humbugs than men.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know your perfect woman!&rdquo; he remarked, softly. &ldquo;You
  search for her through the best years of your life, and when you have found
  her you avoid her. That,&rdquo; he added, handing his empty cup to a footman,
  &ldquo;is why I am a bachelor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Duchess regarded him complacently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Sir Leslie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am afraid you will
  have to find a better reason for your miserable state. The perfect woman
  would certainly have nothing to do with you if you found her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; he declared, confidently, &ldquo;I am
  convinced that she would find me attractive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Duchess shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your theory,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;is antiquated. Like and
  unlike do not attract. We seek in others the qualities which we strive most
  zealously to develop in ourselves. I know a case in point.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Sir Leslie remarked. &ldquo;I like examples. The logic
  of them appeals to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Duchess half closed her eyes. For a moment she was silent. She seemed
  to be listening to something a long way off. Through the open windows of her
  softly shaded drawing-rooms, odourous with flowers, came the rippling of
  water falling from a fountain in the conservatory, the lazy hum of a mowing
  machine on the lawn, the distant tinkling of a hansom bell in the Square. But
  these were not the sounds which for a moment had changed her face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I myself,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;am an example!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A woman who had risen to go sat down again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do go on, Duchess!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Anything in the
  nature of a personal confession is so fascinating, and you know you are such
  an enigma to all of us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; she answered, smiling. &ldquo;Then I am likely to
  remain so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A perfectly obvious person like myself,&rdquo; the woman remarked,
  &ldquo;is always fascinated by the unusual. But if you are really not going
  to give yourself away, Duchess, I am afraid I must move on. One hates to
  leave your beautifully cool rooms. Shall I see you to-night, I wonder, at
  Esholt House?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There were still many people in the room. Some fresh arrivals occupied his
  hostess&rsquo;s attention, and Borrowdean, with a resigned shrug of the
  shoulders, prepared to depart. He had come, hoping for an opportunity to be
  alone for a few minutes with the Duchess, and himself a skilful tactician in
  such small matters, he could not but admire the way she had kept him at
  arm&rsquo;s length. And then the opportunity for a master stroke came. A
  servant sought him out with a card. A man of method, he seldom left his rooms
  without instructions as to where he was to be found.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The gentleman begged you to excuse his coming here, sir,&rdquo; the
  man whispered, confidentially, &ldquo;but he is returning to the country this
  evening, and was anxious to see you. He is quite ready to wait your
  convenience.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean held the card in his hand, scrutinizing it with impassive face.
  Was this a piece of unparalleled good fortune, or simply a trick of the fates
  to tempt him on to catastrophe? With that wonderful swiftness of thought
  which was part of his mental equipment he balanced the chances&mdash;and took
  his risk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should be glad,&rdquo; he said, looking the servant in the face,
  &ldquo;if you would show the gentleman up here as an ordinary visitor. I
  should like to find you down stairs when I come out. You
  understand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly, sir,&rdquo; the man answered, and withdrew.</p>

  <p>Mannering had no idea whose house he was in. The address
  Borrowdean&rsquo;s servant had given him had been simply 81, Grosvenor
  Square. Nevertheless, he was conscious of a little annoyance as he followed
  the servant up the broad stairs. He would much have preferred waiting until
  Borrowdean had concluded his call. He remembered his grey travelling clothes,
  and all his natural distaste for social amenities returned with unabated
  force as he neared the reception-rooms and heard the softly modulated rise
  and fall of feminine voices, the swishing of silks and muslin, the faint
  perfume of flowers and scents which seemed to fill the air. At the last
  moment he would have withdrawn, but his guide seemed deaf. His words passed
  unheeded. His name, very softly but very distinctly, had been announced. He
  had no option but to pass into the room and play the cards which fate and his
  friend had dealt him.</p>

  <p>Borrowdean rose to greet his friend. Mannering, not knowing who his
  hostess might be, and feeling absolutely no curiosity concerning her,
  confined his attention wholly to the man whom he had come to seek.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did not wish to disturb you here, Borrowdean,&rdquo; he said,
  quickly, &ldquo;but if your call is over, could you come away for a few
  minutes? I have a matter to discuss with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean smiled slightly, and laid his hand upon the other&rsquo;s
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By all means, Mannering,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But since you
  have discovered our little secret, don&rsquo;t you think that you had better
  speak to our hostess?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering was puzzled, but his eyes followed Borrowdean&rsquo;s slight
  gesture. Berenice, who at the sound of his voice had suddenly abandoned her
  conversation and risen to her feet, was within a few feet of him. A sudden
  light swept into Mannering&rsquo;s face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he exclaimed softly.</p>

  <p>Her hands went out towards him. Borrowdean, with an almost imperceptible
  movement, checked his advance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So you see we are found out, after all, Duchess,&rdquo; he said,
  turning to her. &ldquo;You have known Mrs. Handsell, Mannering, let me
  present you now to her other self. Duchess, you see that our recluse has come
  to his senses at last. I must really introduce you formally: Mr.
  Mannering&mdash;the Duchess of Lenchester.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice, arrested in her forward movement, watched Mannering&rsquo;s face
  eagerly. So carefully modulated had been Borrowdean&rsquo;s voice that no
  word of his had reached beyond their own immediate circle. It was as though a
  silent tableau were being played out between the three, and Mannering, to
  whom repression had become a habit, gave little indication of anything he
  might have felt. Borrowdean&rsquo;s fixed smile betokened nothing but an
  ordinary interest in the introduction of two friends, and the Duchess&rsquo;s
  back was turned towards her friends. They both waited for Mannering to
  speak.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;is a surprise! I had no idea
  when I called to see Borrowdean here, of the pleasure which was in store for
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean dropped his eyeglass.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you serious, my dear Mannering?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Do
  you mean to say that you came here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only to see you,&rdquo; Mannering interrupted. &ldquo;That you
  should know perfectly well. I am sorry to hurry you out, but the few
  minutes&rsquo; conversation which I desired with you is of some importance,
  and my train leaves in an hour. I hope that you will pardon me,&rdquo; he
  added, looking steadily at Berenice, &ldquo;if I hurry away one of your
  guests.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laughed quite in her natural manner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will forgive anything,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;except that you
  should hurry away yourself so unceremoniously. Come and sit down near me. I
  want to talk to you about Blakeley.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She swept her gown on one side, disclosing a vacant place on the settee
  where she had been sitting. For a second her eyes said more to him than her
  courteous but half-careless words of invitation. Mannering made no movement
  forward.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it is impossible for me to
  stay!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She seemed to dismiss him and the whole subject with a careless little
  shrug of the shoulders, which was all the farewell she vouchsafed to either
  of them. A woman who had just entered seemed to absorb her whole attention.
  The two men passed out.</p>

  <p>Mannering spoke no word until they stood upon the pavement. Then he turned
  almost savagely upon his companion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is a trick of yours, I suppose!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
  &ldquo;Damn you and your meddling, Borrowdean. Why can&rsquo;t you leave me
  and my affairs alone? No, I am not going your way. Let us separate
  here!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are unreasonable, Mannering,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have done
  only what I believe you were on your way to ask me to do. I have brought you
  and Berenice together again. It was for both your sakes. If there has been
  any misunderstanding between you, it would be better cleared up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering gripped his arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us go to your rooms, Borrowdean,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is
  time we understood one another.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Willingly!&rdquo; Borrowdean said. &ldquo;But your
  train?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let my train go,&rdquo; Mannering answered. &ldquo;There are some
  things I have to say to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean called a hansom. The two men drove off together.</p>

     name="ref-b108"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE MANNERING MYSTERY</h2>

  <p>Borrowdean was curter than usual, even abrupt. The calm geniality of his
  manner had departed. He spoke in short, terse sentences, and he had the air
  of a man struggling to subdue a fit of perfectly reasonable and justifiable
  anger. It was a carefully cultivated pose. He even refrained from his
  customary cigarette.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Mannering,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there are times when a
  few plain words are worth an hour&rsquo;s conversation. Will you have them
  from me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This thing was started six months ago, soon after those two
  bye-elections in Yorkshire. Even the most despondent of us then saw that the
  Government could scarcely last its time. We had a meeting and we attempted to
  form on paper a trial cabinet. You know our weakness. We have to try to form
  a National party out of a number of men who, although they call themselves
  broadly Liberals, are as far apart as the very poles of thought. It was as
  much as they could do to sit in the same room together. From the opening of
  the meeting until its close, there was but one subject upon which every one
  was unanimous. That was the absolute necessity of getting you to come back to
  our aid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You flatter me,&rdquo; Mannering said, with fine irony.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You yourself,&rdquo; Borrowdean continued, without heeding the
  interruption, &ldquo;encouraged us. From the first pronouncement of this
  wonderful new policy you sprang into the arena. We were none of us ready. You
  were! It is true that your weapon was the pen, but you reached a great
  public. The country to-day considers you the champion of Free
  Trade.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pass on,&rdquo; Mannering interrupted, brusquely. &ldquo;All this
  is wasted time!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A smaller meeting,&rdquo; Borrowdean continued, &ldquo;was held
  with a view of discussing the means whereby you could be persuaded to rejoin
  us. At that meeting the Duchess of Lenchester was present.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering, who had been pacing the room, stopped short. He grasped the
  back of a chair, and turning round faced Borrowdean.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know what place the Duchess has held in the councils of our
  party since the Duke&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; Borrowdean continued. &ldquo;She
  has the political instinct. If she were a man she would be a leader. All the
  great ladies are on the other side, but the Duchess is more than equal to
  them all. She entertains magnificently, and with tact. She never makes a
  mistake. She is part and parcel of the Liberal Party. It was she who
  volunteered to make the first effort to bring you back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering turned his head. Apparently he was looking out of the
  window.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Her methods,&rdquo; Borrowdean continued, &ldquo;did not commend
  themselves to us, but beggars must not be choosers. Besides, the Duchess was
  in love with her own scheme. Such objections as we made were at once
  overruled.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He paused, but Mannering said nothing. He was still looking out of the
  window, though his eyes saw nothing of the street below, or the great club
  buildings opposite. A scent of roses, lost now and then in the salter
  fragrance of the night breeze sweeping over the marshes, the magic of a
  wonderful, white- clad presence, the low words, the sense of a world apart, a
  world of speechless beauty&hellip;. What empty dreams! A palace built in a
  poet&rsquo;s fancy upon a quicksand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Duchess,&rdquo; Borrowdean continued, &ldquo;undertook to
  discover from you what prospects there were, if any, of your return to
  political life. She took none of us into her confidence. We none of us knew
  what means she meant to employ. She disappeared. She communicated with none
  of us. We none of us had the least idea what had become of her. Time went on,
  and we began to get a little uneasy. We had a meeting and it was arranged
  that I should come down and see you. I came, I saw you, I saw the Duchess!
  The situation very soon became clear to me. Instead of the Duchess converting
  you, you had very nearly converted the Duchess.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can assure you&mdash;&rdquo; Mannering began.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me finish,&rdquo; Borrowdean pleaded. &ldquo;I realized the
  situation at a glance. Your attitude I was not so much surprised at, but the
  attitude of the Duchess, I must confess, amazed me. I came to the conclusion
  that I had found my way into a forgotten corner of the world, where the lotos
  flowers still blossomed, and the sooner I was out of it the better. Now I
  think that brings us, Mannering, up to the present time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering turned from the window, out of which he had been steadfastly
  gazing. There was a strained look under his eyes, and little trace of the tan
  upon his, cheeks. He had the air of a jaded and a weary man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is all, then,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I can still catch my
  train.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean held out his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is not all. This explanation I have
  made for your sake, Mannering, and it has been a truthful and full one. Now
  it is my turn. I have a few words to say to you on my own account.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering paused. There was a note of something unusual in
  Borrowdean&rsquo;s voice, a portent of things behind. Mannering involuntarily
  straightened himself. Something was awakened in him which had lain dormant
  for many years&mdash;dormant since those old days of battle, of swift attack,
  of ambushed defence and the clamour of brilliant tongues. Some of the old
  light flashed in his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say it then&mdash;quickly!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We speak of great things,&rdquo; Borrowdean continued, &ldquo;and
  the catching of a train is a trifle. My wardrobe and house are at your
  service. Don&rsquo;t hurry me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The men who count in this world,&rdquo; Borrowdean declared, calmly
  lighting a cigarette, &ldquo;are either thinkers of great thoughts or doers
  of great deeds. To the former belong the poets and the sentimentalists; to
  the latter the statesmen and the soldiers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What have I done,&rdquo; Mannering murmured, &ldquo;that I should
  be sent back to kindergarten? Platitudes such as this bore me. Let me catch
  my train.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In a moment. To all my arguments and appeals, to all my entreaties
  to you to realize yourself, to do your duty to us, to history and to
  posterity, you have replied in one manner only. You have spoken from the
  mushroom pedestal of the sentimentalist. Not a single word that has fallen
  from your lips has rung true. You have spoken as though your eyes were blind
  all the time to the letters of fire which truth has spelled out before you.
  Any further argument with you is useless, because you are not honest. You
  conceal your true position, and you adopt a false defence. Therefore, I
  relinquish my task. You can go and grow your roses, and think your poetry,
  and call it life if you will. But before you go I should like you to know
  that I, at least, am not deceived. I do not believe in you, Mannering. I ask
  you a question, and I challenge you to answer it. What is your true reason
  for making a scrap-heap of your career?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you my friend,&rdquo; Mannering asked, quietly, &ldquo;that you
  wish to pry behind the curtain of my life? If I have other reasons they
  concern myself alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean shook his head. He had scored, but he took care to show no sign
  of triumph.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The issue is too great,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to be tried by the
  ordinary rules which govern social life. Will you presume that I am your
  friend, and let us consider the whole matter afresh together?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; Mannering answered. &ldquo;But I will do this. I
  will answer your question. There is another reason which makes my
  reappearance in public life impossible. Not even your subtlety, Borrowdean,
  could remove it. I do not even wish it removed. I mean to live my own life,
  and not to be pitchforked back into politics to suit the convenience of a few
  adventurous office-seekers, and the Duchess of Lenchester!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mannering!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Mannering had gone.</p>

  <p>Borrowdean felt that this was a trying day. After a battle with Mannering
  he was face to face with an angry woman, to whose presence an imperious
  little note had just summoned him. Berenice was dressed for a royal dinner
  party, and she had only a few minutes to spare. Nevertheless she contrived to
  make them very unpleasant ones for Borrowdean.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The affair was entirely an accident,&rdquo; he pleaded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was nothing of the sort,&rdquo; she answered, bluntly. &ldquo;I
  know you too well for that. Your bringing him here without warning was an
  unwarrantable interference with my affairs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean could hold his own with men, but Berenice in her own room, a
  wonderful little paradise of soft colourings and luxury so perfectly chosen
  that it was rather felt than seen; Berenice, in her marvellous gown, with the
  necklace upon her bosom and the tiara flashing in her dark hair, was an
  overwhelming opponent. Borrowdean was helpless. He could not understand the
  attack itself. He failed altogether to appreciate its tenour.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;but I did not know that you
  had any plans. All that you told us on your return from Blakely was that you
  had failed. So far as you were concerned the matter seemed to me to be over,
  and with it, I imagined, your interest in Mannering. I brought him
  here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because I wished him to know who you were. I wished him to
  understand the improbability of your ever again returning to
  Blakely.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are telling the truth now, at any rate,&rdquo; she remarked,
  curtly, &ldquo;or what sounds like the truth. Why did you trouble in the
  matter at all? Where I have failed you are not likely to succeed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean smiled for the first time.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have still some hopes of doing so,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>

  <p>The Duchess glanced at the little Louis Seize time- piece, and
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You had better abandon them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Lawrence
  Mannering may be wrong, or he may be right, but he believes in his choice. He
  has no ambition. You have no motive left to work upon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are wrong, Duchess,&rdquo; he remarked, simply. &ldquo;I never
  believed in Mannering&rsquo;s sentimentality. To-day, with his own lips, he
  has confessed to me that another, an unbroached reason, stands behind his
  refusal!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And he never told me,&rdquo; the Duchess murmured,
  involuntarily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Duchess,&rdquo; Borrowdean answered, with a faint, cynical parting
  of the lips, &ldquo;there are matters which a man does not mention to the
  woman in whose high opinion he aims at holding an exalted place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door. The Duchess&rsquo;s maid entered, carrying
  a long cloak of glimmering lace and satin.</p>

  <p>The Duchess nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I come at once, Hortense,&rdquo; she said, in French. &ldquo;Sir
  Leslie,&rdquo; she added, turning towards him, &ldquo;you are making a great
  mistake, and I advise you to be careful. You are one of those who think ill
  of all men. Such men as Lawrence Mannering belong to a race of human beings
  of whom you know nothing. I listened to you once, and I was a fool. You could
  as soon teach me to believe that you were a saint, as that Mannering had
  anything in his past or present life of which he was ashamed. Now,
  Hortense.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean walked off, still smiling. How simple half the world was.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b109"
     name="ref-b109"></a>IX. &mdash; THE PUMPING OF MRS. PHILLIMORE</h2>

  <p>Hester sprang to her feet eagerly as she heard the front door close, and
  standing behind the curtain she watched the man, who was already upon the
  pavement looking up and down the street for a hansom. His erect,
  distinguished figure was perfectly familiar to her. It was Sir Leslie
  Borrowdean again.</p>

  <p>She resumed her seat in front of the typewriter, and touched the keys
  idly. In a few moments what she had been expecting happened. Her mother
  entered the room.</p>

  <p>Of her advent there were the usual notifications. An immense rustling of
  silken skirts, and an overwhelming odour of the latest Bond Street perfume.
  She flung herself into a chair, and regarded her daughter with a complacent
  smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That delightful man has been to see me again,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
  &ldquo;I could scarcely believe it when Mary brought me his card. By the bye,
  where is Mary? I want her to try to take that stain out of my pink silk
  skirt. I shall have to wear it to-night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will ring for her directly,&rdquo; the girl answered. &ldquo;So
  that was Sir Leslie Borrowdean, mother! Why did he come to see you again so
  soon?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea,&rdquo; Mrs. Phillimore announced,
  &ldquo;but I thought it was very sweet of him. It seems all the more
  remarkable when one considers the sort of man he is. He&rsquo;s very
  ambitious, you know, and devoted to politics.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where did you meet him first?&rdquo; Hester asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was at the Metropole at Bexhill,&rdquo; Mrs. Phillimore
  answered. &ldquo;We motored down there one day, and Lena Roberts told me that
  she heard him inquiring who I was directly we came into the room. He joined
  our party at luncheon. Billy knew him slightly, so I made him go over and ask
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hester nodded, and seemed to be absorbed in some trifling defect of one of
  the keys of her typewriter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does he still ask you many questions about Mr. Mannering,
  mother?&rdquo; she asked, quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;About Mr. Mannering!&rdquo; Mrs. Phillimore repeated, with raised
  eyebrows. &ldquo;Why, he scarcely ever mentions his name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She took up a small mirror from the table by her side, and critically
  touched her hair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;About Mr. Mannering, indeed,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Why do you
  ask me such a question?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you really want to know, mother?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When Mr. Mannering was here last,&rdquo; Hester said, &ldquo;he
  asked me whether Sir Leslie Borrowdean was a friend of yours. I fancy that
  they are political acquaintances, but I don&rsquo;t think that they are on
  very good terms.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mrs. Phillimore laid down the mirror and yawned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s nothing very strange about that,&rdquo; she
  declared. &ldquo;Lawrence isn&rsquo;t the sort to get on with many people,
  especially since he went and buried himself in the country. How pale you are
  looking, child. Why don&rsquo;t you go and take a walk, instead of hammering
  away at that old typewriter? Any one would think that you had to do it for a
  living!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I prefer to earn my own living,&rdquo; the girl answered,
  &ldquo;and I am not in the least tired. Tell me, are you going to see Sir
  Leslie Borrowdean again, mother?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The woman on the couch smoothed her hair once more, with a smile of
  gratification.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir Leslie has asked me to join a small party of friends for dinner
  at the Carlton this evening,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;Why on earth are
  you looking at me like that, child? You&rsquo;re always grumbling that my
  friends are a fast lot, and don&rsquo;t suit you. You can&rsquo;t say
  anything against Sir Leslie.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl had risen to her feet. The trouble in her face was manifest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she said, slowly, &ldquo;I wish that you were not
  going. I wish that you would have nothing whatever to do with Sir Leslie
  Borrowdean.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good Heavens!&mdash;and why not?&rdquo; the woman exclaimed,
  suddenly sitting up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe that he only asked you because he has an idea that you
  can tell him&mdash;something he wants to know about Mr. Mannering,&rdquo; the
  girl answered, steadily. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that you ought to
  go!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; her mother answered, crossly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
  believe that he has such an idea in his head. As though he couldn&rsquo;t ask
  me for the sake of my company. And if he does ask me questions, I&rsquo;m not
  obliged to answer them, am I? Do you think that I&rsquo;m to be turned inside
  out like a schoolgirl?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir Leslie is very clever, and he is very unscrupulous,&rdquo; the
  girl answered. &ldquo;I wish you weren&rsquo;t going! I believe that he wants
  to find out things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mrs. Phillimore frowned uneasily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a fool!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s welcome to
  all he can get to know through me. I don&rsquo;t know what you want to try to
  make me uncomfortable for, Hester, I&rsquo;m sure. Sir Leslie has never
  betrayed the least curiosity about Mr. Mannering, and I don&rsquo;t believe
  that he&rsquo;s any such idea in his head. Upon my word I don&rsquo;t see why
  you should think it impossible that Sir Leslie should come here just for the
  sake of improving an acquaintance which he found pleasant. That&rsquo;s what
  he gave me to understand, and he put it very nicely too!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not think that Sir Leslie is that sort of man,
  mother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t see how you know anything about it,&rdquo; was
  the sharp response. &ldquo;Ring the bell, please. I want to speak to Mary
  about my skirt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean to dine with him then, mother?&rdquo; she asked, crossing
  the room towards the bell.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course! I&rsquo;ve accepted. To-night and as often as he chooses
  to ask me. Now don&rsquo;t upset me, please. I want to look my best to-night,
  and if I get angry my hair goes all out of curl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl went back to her typewriter. She unfolded a sheet of copy, and
  placed it on the stand before her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you have made up your mind, mother, I suppose you will
  go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Still&mdash;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mrs. Phillimore shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I did what you wished all the time,&rdquo; she remarked,
  pettishly, &ldquo;I might as well drown myself at once. Can&rsquo;t you
  understand, Hester?&rdquo; she added, with a sudden change of manner,
  &ldquo;that I must do something to help me to forget? You don&rsquo;t want to
  see me go mad, do you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl turned half round in her chair. She was fronting a mirror. She
  caught a momentary impression of herself&mdash;pallid, hollow- eyed, weary.
  She sighed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are other ways of forgetting,&rdquo; she murmured.
  &ldquo;There is work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her mother laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have chosen your way,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;let me choose
  mine. Turn round, Hester.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl obeyed her languidly. Her mother eyed her with an attention she
  seldom vouchsafed to anything. Her plain black frock was ill- fitting and
  worn. She wore no ribbon or jewellery or adornment of any sort. Negatively
  her face was not ill-pleasing, but her figure was angular, and her complexion
  almost an&aelig;mic. The woman on the couch represented other things. She was
  tastefully, though somewhat elaborately dressed. She wore chains and trinkets
  about her neck, rings upon her fingers, and in her face had begun in earnest
  the tragic struggle between an actual forty and presumptive twenty. She
  laughed again, a little hardly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you are my daughter,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You are one
  of the freaks of heredity. I&rsquo;m perfectly certain you don&rsquo;t belong
  to me, and as for him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; the girl cried.</p>

  <p>The woman nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to mention
  him. I won&rsquo;t again. But we are different, aren&rsquo;t we? I wonder why
  you stay with me. I wonder you don&rsquo;t go and make a home for yourself
  somewhere. I know that you hate all the things I do, and care for, and all my
  friends. Why don&rsquo;t you go away? It would be more comfortable for both
  of us!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no wish to go away,&rdquo; the girl said, softly, &ldquo;and
  I don&rsquo;t think that we interfere with one another very much, do we? This
  is the first time I have ever made a remark about any&mdash;of your friends.
  To-night I cannot help it. Sir Leslie Borrowdean is Mr. Mannering&rsquo;s
  enemy. I am sure of it! That is why I do not like the idea of your going out
  with him. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to be right&mdash;and I am afraid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Afraid! You little idiot!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir Leslie Borrowdean is a very clever man,&rdquo; the girl said.
  &ldquo;He is a very clever man, and he has been a lawyer. That sort of person
  knows how to ask questions&mdash;to&mdash;find out things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; the woman remarked, sitting up on the couch.
  &ldquo;Why do you try to make me so uncomfortable, Hester? Sir Leslie may be
  very clever, but I am not exactly a fool myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She spoke confidently, but under the delicate coating of rouge her cheeks
  had whitened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;Sir Leslie has never even
  mentioned Mr. Mannering&rsquo;s name in anything except the most casual way.
  You don&rsquo;t understand everything, Hester. Of course Lena and Billy
  Aswell and Rothe and all of them are all right, but they are just a
  little&mdash;well, you would call it fast, and it does one good to be seen
  with a different set sometimes. Sir Leslie Borrowdean and his friends are
  altogether different, of course.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl bent over her work.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No doubt, mother,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Mary
  stamping on the floor. I expect she has your bath ready.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>An hour or so later Mrs. Phillimore departed in a hired brougham. Her hair
  had been carefully arranged by a local expert who had an establishment in the
  next street, her pink silk gown had come through the ordeal of cleansing with
  remarkable success, and the heels on her new evening shoes resembled more
  than anything else, miniature stilts. Her face was wreathed in smiles, and
  she possessed the good conscience and light heart of a woman who feels that
  she has made a successful toilette. All the vague misgivings of a short while
  ago had vanished. She gave her hair a final touch in the side window of the
  carriage as she drove off, and quite forgot to wave her hand to Hester, who
  was standing at the window to see her go. If any misgivings remained at all
  between the two, they were not with her. She settled herself back amongst the
  cushions with a little sigh of content. Sir Leslie was a most charming
  person, and evidently not at all insensible to her charms. She was sure that
  she was going to have a delightful evening.</p>

  <p>Borrowdean, if he possessed no conscience, was not altogether free from
  some kindred eccentricity. He was reminded sharply enough of the fact about
  one o&rsquo;clock the next morning, when the door of the little house on
  Merton Street was suddenly opened before he could touch the bell. Framed in a
  little slanting gleam of light, Hester, still wearing her plain black gown,
  stood and looked at him. His careless words of explanation died away upon his
  lips. The fire which flashed from her hollow eyes seemed to wither up the
  very sources of speech within him. The half lights were kind to her. He saw
  nothing of the hollow cheeks. The weariness of her pose and manner had passed
  like magic away. She stood there, erect as a dart, her head thrown back, a
  curious mixture of scorn, of loathing, and of fear in her expression. She
  looked at him steadily, and he felt his cheeks burn. He was
  ashamed&mdash;ashamed of himself, ashamed of his errand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your mother,&rdquo; he said, struggling to look away from her,
  &ldquo;is&mdash;a little unwell. The heat of the room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She swept down the steps and passed him. Before he could reach her side
  she was tugging at the handle of the carriage door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she cried, through the window, &ldquo;undo the
  door!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Mrs. Phillimore made no answer. When at last the door was opened she
  was discovered half asleep in a corner. Her hair was in some disorder, and
  her cheeks no longer preserved that even colouring which is a result of the
  artistic use of the rouge-pot. Her head was thrown back, and she was
  apparently asleep. Hester stifled a sob. She took her mother by the arm, and
  shook her.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Phillimore sat up and smiled a sleepy smile. She made a few
  incoherent remarks. They helped her into the house and into an easy- chair,
  where she promptly turned her face towards the cushions and resumed her
  slumber. Sir Leslie moved towards the door, then hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Phillimore,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I cannot tell you how sorry
  I am that this should have happened.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was on her knees before her mother. She turned and rose slowly to her
  feet. Sir Leslie never quite forgot her gesture as she motioned him towards
  the door. It was one of the most uncomfortable moments of his life.</p><a id=

  </div><br>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She did not speak a word, yet Sir Leslie obeyed what seemed to him more
  eloquent than words. He turned and left the room and the house. Without any
  change in her tense expression she waited until she heard him go. Then she
  sank upon her knees on the hearthrug, and hid her face in her hands.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref-b110"
     name="ref-b110"></a>X. &mdash; THE MAN WITH A MOTIVE</h2>

  <p>Mannering sat alone in the shade of his cedar tree. He had walked in his
  rose-garden amongst a wilderness of drooping blossoms, for the season of
  roses was gone. He had crossed the marshland seawards, only to find a little
  crowd of holiday-makers in possession of the golf links and the green tufted
  stretch of sandy shore. The day had been long, almost irksome. A fit of
  restlessness had driven him from his study. He seemed to have lost all power
  of concentration. For once his brain had failed him. The shadowy companions
  who stood ever between him and solitude remained uninvoked. His cigar had
  burnt out between his fingers. He threw it impatiently away. These were the
  days, the hours he dreaded.</p>

  <p>Clara came down the garden from the house, and seeing him, crossed the
  lawn and sat down beside him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, my dear uncle,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;you look almost as
  dull as I feel! Let us be miserable together!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Whilst we are about
  it, can we invent a cause?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Invent!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I do not think we need either
  of us look very far. Every one seems to have gone away whose presence made
  this place endurable. Uncle, do you know when Mrs. Handsell is coming back?
  She promised to write, and I have never heard a word!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering turned his head. A little rustling wind had stolen in from
  seaward. Above their heads flights of sea-gulls were floating out towards the
  creeks. He watched them idly until they dropped down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not think that she will come back at all,&rdquo; he said,
  quietly. &ldquo;I heard to-day that the place was to let again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And Sir Leslie Borrowdean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think you may take it for granted,&rdquo; Mannering remarked,
  dryly, &ldquo;that we shall see no more of him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl leaned back and sighed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Uncle, what is it that makes you such a hermit?&rdquo; she
  asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Age, perhaps, and experience,&rdquo; he answered, lightly.
  &ldquo;There are not many people in the world, Clara, who are worth
  while!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Handsell was worth while,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>

  <p>Mannering did not reply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And Sir Leslie Borrowdean,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;was more
  than just worth while. I think that he was delightful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very young ladies, and very old ones,&rdquo; Mannering remarked,
  grimly, &ldquo;generally like Borrowdean.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what about Mrs. Handsell?&rdquo; she asked, with a spice of
  malice in her tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Handsell,&rdquo; Mannering answered, coolly, &ldquo;was a very
  charming woman. Since both these people have passed out of our lives, Clara,
  I scarcely see why we need discuss them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One must talk about something,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;At least
  I must talk, and you must pretend to listen. I positively cannot exist in the
  house by myself any longer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is Richard?&rdquo; Mannering asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gone into Norwich to dine at the barracks with some stupid men. Not
  that I mind his going,&rdquo; she added, hastily. &ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d
  stay away for a month. Of course he&rsquo;s a very good sort, and all that,
  but he&rsquo;s deadly monotonous. Uncle, really, as a matter of curiosity,
  before I get to be an old woman I should like to see one other young
  man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Plenty on the links just now!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know it. I sat out near the ninth hole all this morning. There
  are some Cambridge boys who looked quite nice. One of them was really
  delightful when I showed him where his ball was, but I can&rsquo;t consider
  that an introduction, can I? Heavens, who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Behind the trim maid-servant already crossing the lawn, and within a few
  yards of them, came a strange, almost tragical, figure. Her plain black
  clothes and hat were powdered with dust, there were deep lines under her
  eyes, she swayed a little when she walked, as though with fatigue. She seemed
  to bring with her into the cool, quiet garden, with its country odours and
  general air of peace, an alien note. One almost heard the deep undercry from
  a far-away world of suffering&mdash;the great, ever-moving wheels seemed to
  have caught her up and thrown her down in this most incongruous of places.
  Clara, in her cool white dress, her fresh complexion, her general air of
  health and girlish vigour, seemed, as she rose to her feet, a creature of
  another sex, almost of another world. The two girls exchanged for a moment
  wondering glances. Then Mannering intervened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hester!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Why&mdash;is there anything
  wrong?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;very serious,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But I had
  to see you. I thought that I had better come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He held out his hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have had a tiring journey,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You must come
  into the house and let them find you something to eat. Clara, this is Hester
  Phillimore, the daughter of an old friend of mine. Will you see about a room
  for her, and lend her anything she requires?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Clara answered. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come into
  the house with me?&rdquo; she added pleasantly to the girl. &ldquo;You must
  be horribly tired travelling this hot weather, and this is such an
  out-of-the-way corner of the world!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hester lingered for a moment, glancing nervously at Mannering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must go back to-night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I only came
  because I thought that it would be quicker than writing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To-night?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;But, my dear girl, that is
  impossible. There are no trains, and you are tired out already. Go into the
  house with my niece, and we will have a talk afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He walked across the lawn with them, talking pleasantly to Hester, as
  though her visit were in no sense of the word unpleasant, or an extraordinary
  event. But when he returned to his seat under the cedar tree his whole
  expression was changed. The lines about his face had insensibly deepened. He
  leaned a little forward, looking with weary, unseeing eyes into the tangled
  shrubbery. Had all men, he wondered, this secret chapter in their
  lives&mdash;the one sore place so impossible to forget, the cupboard of
  shadows never wholly closed, shadows which at any moment might steal out and
  encompass his darkening life? He sat there motionless, and his thoughts
  travelled backwards. There were many things in his life which he had
  forgotten, but never this. Every word that had been spoken, every detail in
  that tragic little scene seemed to glide into his memory with a distinctness
  and amplitude which time had never for one second dimmed. So it must be until
  the end. He forgot the girl and her errand. He forgot the carefully
  cultivated philosophy which for so many years had helped him towards
  forgetfulness. So he sat until the sound of their voices upon the lawn
  recalled him to the present.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will leave you to have your talk with uncle,&rdquo; Clara said.
  &ldquo;Afterwards I will come back to you. There he is, sitting under the
  cedar tree.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl came swiftly over to his side. For a moment the compassion which
  he had always felt for her swept away the memory of his own sorrow. Her
  pallid, colourless face had lost everything except expression. If the
  weariness, which seemed to have found a home in her eyes, was just now
  absent, it was because a worse thing was shining out of them&mdash;a fear, of
  which there were traces even in her hurried walk and tone. He rose at once
  and held out his hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come and sit down, Hester,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t
  look so frightened.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She obeyed him at once.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am frightened,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because I feel that I
  ought not to have come here, and yet I thought that you ought to know at once
  what has happened. Sir Leslie Borrowdean has been coming to see mother. Last
  night he took her out to dinner. She came home&mdash;late&mdash;she was not
  quite herself. This morning she was frightened and hysterical. She
  said&mdash;that she had been talking.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To Sir Leslie Borrowdean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering showed no signs of dismay. He took the girl&rsquo;s thin white
  hand in his, and held it almost affectionately.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am very glad to know this at once, dear,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;and you did what was right and kind when you came to see me. But Sir
  Leslie Borrowdean has no reason to make himself my enemy. On the contrary,
  just now he seems particularly anxious to cultivate my friendship.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then why,&rdquo; the girl asked, &ldquo;has he gone out of his way
  to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering stopped her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He had a motive, of course. Borrowdean is one of those men who do
  nothing without a motive. I believe that I can even guess what it is.
  Don&rsquo;t let this thing distress you too much, Hester. I do not think that
  we have anything to worry about.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But he knows!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I could not imagine a man,&rdquo; Mannering answered, &ldquo;better
  able to keep a secret.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl sat silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose I have been an idiot,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have been nothing of the sort,&rdquo; Mannering asserted,
  firmly. &ldquo;You have done just what is kind, and what will help me to save
  the situation. I must confess that I should not like to have been taken by
  surprise. You have saved me from that. Now let us put the whole subject away
  for a time. How I wish that you could stay here for a few days.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl smiled a little piteously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I ought not to have left her even for so long as this,&rdquo; she
  said. &ldquo;I must go back to-morrow morning by the first train.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He nodded. He felt that it was useless to combat her resolution.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You and I,&rdquo; he said, gravely, &ldquo;have both our burdens to
  carry. Only it seems a little unfair that Providence should have made my back
  so much the broader. Listen, Hester!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The full murmur of the sea growing louder and louder as the salt water
  flowed up into the creeks betokened the change of tide. Faint wreaths of mist
  were rising up from over the shadowy marshland. Above them were the stars. He
  laid his hand upon her shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear child!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think that you understand how
  it is that the burden, after all, is easier for me. A man may forget his
  troubles here, for all the while there is this eternal background of peaceful
  things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her hand stole into his.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;I understand. Don&rsquo;t let them
  ever bring you away.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a id="ref-b111"
     name="ref-b111"></a>XI. &mdash; MANNERING&rsquo;S ALTERNATIVE</h2>

  <p>Once again Mannering found himself in the over- scented, overheated room,
  which was perhaps of all places in the world the one he hated the most. Fresh
  from the wind-swept places of his country home, he found the atmosphere
  intolerable. After a few minutes&rsquo; waiting he threw open the windows and
  leaned out. Hester was walking in the Square somewhere. He had a shrewd idea
  that she had been sent out of the way. With a restless impatience of her
  absence he awaited the interview which he dreaded.</p>

  <p>Her mother&rsquo;s coming took him a little by surprise. She seemed to
  have laid aside all her usual customs. She entered the room quietly. She
  greeted him almost nervously. She was dressed, without at any rate any
  obvious attempt to attract, in a plain black gown, and with none of the
  extravagances in which she sometimes delighted. Her usual boisterous
  confidence of manner seemed to have deserted her. Her face, without its
  skilful touches of rouge, looked thin, and almost peaked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am so glad that you came, Lawrence,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It
  was very good of you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She glanced towards the opened windows, and he closed them at once.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you have not been
  well!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a touch of her old self in the hardness of her low laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is remorse!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I think that for once in
  my life I have permitted myself to think! It is a great mistake. One loses
  confidence when one realizes what a beast one is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He waited in silence. It seemed to him the best thing. She sat down a
  little wearily. He remained standing a few feet away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have given you away, Lawrence,&rdquo; she said, quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hester has told you, of course. I am not blaming her. She did quite
  right. Only I should have told you myself. I wanted to be the first to assure
  you of this. Our secret is quite safe. The man&mdash;with whom I made a fool
  of myself&mdash;has given me his word of honour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir Leslie Borrowdean&rsquo;s&mdash;word of honour!&rdquo;
  Mannering remarked, with slow scorn. &ldquo;Do you know the man, I
  wonder?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know that he wishes to be your friend, and not your enemy,&rdquo;
  she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He chooses his friends for what they are worth to him,&rdquo;
  Mannering answered. &ldquo;It is all a matter of self-interest. He has some
  idea of making me the stepping-stone to his advancement. I have a place just
  now in his scheme of life. But as for friendship! Borrowdean does not know
  the meaning of the word.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You speak bitterly,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know the man,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you tell me,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;what it is that he wants
  of you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is this worth discussing between us?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well, then, you shall know. He wants me to re-enter political
  life, to be the jackal to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To re-enter political life! And why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering turned abruptly round and looked her in the face. He had been
  gazing out of the window, wondering how long it would be before Hester
  returned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I!&rdquo; he repeated, a little vaguely. &ldquo;How
  can you ask me such a question as that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was undisturbed. Again he marvelled at the change in her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it so very extraordinary a question?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
  have often wondered whether you meant to content yourself with your present
  life always. It is scarcely worthy of you, is it? You were born to other
  things than to live the life of a country gentleman. You dabble in
  literature, they say, and poke your stick into politics through the pages of
  the reviews. Why don&rsquo;t you take your coat off and play the
  game?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering was silent for several moments. He was, however, meditating his
  own reply less than studying his questioner. Her attitude was amazing to him.
  She watched him all the time, frowning.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are not usually so tongue-tied,&rdquo; she remarked, irritably.
  &ldquo;Have you nothing to say to me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am wondering,&rdquo; he said, quietly, &ldquo;what has given
  birth to this sudden interest in my proceedings. What does it matter to you
  how my days are spent, or what manner of use I make of them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There was a time&mdash;&rdquo; she began.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A time irretrievably past,&rdquo; he interrupted, shortly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not so sure!&rdquo; she declared, doubtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What has Borrowdean to do with this?&rdquo; he asked her,
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Borrowdean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Surely! Some one has been putting notions into your
  head.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why take that for granted?&rdquo; she asked, equably. &ldquo;The
  pity of the whole thing is obvious enough, isn&rsquo;t it? Sometimes I think
  that we were a pair of fools. We played into the hands of fate. We were
  brought face to face with a terrible situation. Instead of meeting it bravely
  we played the coward. Why don&rsquo;t you forget, Lawrence, as I have done?
  Take up your work again. Set a seal upon&mdash;that memory.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have outgrown my ambitions,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Life was
  hot enough in my veins then. Desire grows cold with the years. I am
  content.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;am not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We each chose our life,&rdquo; he reminded her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps. I am not satisfied with my choice. You may be with
  yours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She leaned over towards him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you offered me what you
  called&mdash;atonement. I refused it. Just then it seemed horrible. Now that
  feeling has passed away. I am lonely, Lawrence, and I am weary of the sort of
  life I have been living. Supposing I asked you to make me that offer
  again?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering turned slowly towards her. He was not a man who easily showed
  emotion, but there were traces of it now in his face. The hand which rested
  on the back of his chair shook. There was in his eyes the look of a man who
  sees evil things.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is too late, Blanche,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You cannot be in
  earnest?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she murmured, dropping her eyes. &ldquo;I am tired
  of my life. What you owed me then you owe me now. Why should it be too late?
  I am not an old woman yet, nor are you an old man, and I am weary of being
  alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering walked to the window. His hand went to his forehead. It was damp
  and cold. He was afraid! If she were in earnest! And she spoke like a woman
  who knew her mind. She was always, he remembered, a creature of caprice. If
  she were really in earnest!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have drifted too far apart, Blanche,&rdquo; he said, making an
  effort to face the situation. &ldquo;Years ago this might have been possible.
  To- day it would be a dismal failure. My ways are not yours. The life I lead
  would bore you to death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is no reason why you should not alter it,&rdquo; she
  answered, calmly. &ldquo;In fact, I should wish you to. Blakely all the year
  round would be an impossibility. You could come and live in
  London.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked at her fixedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you forgotten?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>She covered her face with her hands for a moment. If indeed she really
  felt any emotion it passed quickly away, for when she looked up again there
  were no traces left.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have forgotten nothing,&rdquo; she declared, defiantly.
  &ldquo;Only the horror and fear of it all has passed away. I don&rsquo;t see
  why I should suffer all my life. In fact, I don&rsquo;t mean to. I
  don&rsquo;t want to be a miserable, lonely old woman. I want a home,
  something different from this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering faced her gravely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blanche,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are proposing something which
  would most surely ruin the rest of our lives. What we might have been to one
  another if things had been different it is hard to say. But this much is very
  certain. We belong now to different worlds. We have drifted apart with the
  years. Even the little we see of one another now is far from a pleasure to
  either of us. What you are suggesting would be simply suicidal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was silent. He watched her anxiously. As a rule her face was easy
  enough to read. To-day it was impenetrable. He could not tell what was
  passing behind that still, almost stony, look. Her silence forced him again
  into speech.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You agree with me, surely, Blanche? You must agree with
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She raised her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not sure that I do,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But at least I
  understand you. That is something! You want to go on as you are&mdash;apart
  from me. That is true, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At least you are candid. You want your liberty&mdash;unfettered.
  What are you willing to pay for it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked at her incredulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not quite understand!&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>She laughed, and the laugh belonged to her old self.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed! I thought that I was explicit enough, brutally explicit,
  even. What have you to offer me in place of your name and yourself? What
  sacrifice are you prepared to make?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked at her furtively, as though even then he doubted the
  significance of her words.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have already half my income,&rdquo; he said, slowly.</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A thousand a year! What can one do on that? To live decently in
  town one needs much more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is as much as I can offer,&rdquo; he remarked, stiffly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you should earn money,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  easy enough for men with brains. Go back into politics instead of idling your
  time away down in Blakely. I mean it! I&rsquo;ve no patience with men who
  have a right to a place in the world which they won&rsquo;t fill.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he remonstrated, &ldquo;I may be allowed to choose
  the manner of my life!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you can afford to&mdash;yes,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But I
  want one of two things. The first seems to scare you to death even to think
  of. The second is more money&mdash;a good deal more money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;even if I did as you suggested,
  and went back into politics, it would be some time, if ever, before I should
  be any better off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will wait until that time comes,&rdquo; she answered,
  &ldquo;provided that when it does, you share with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then Mannering understood.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you are an apt
  conspirator indeed. All this time you have been fooling me. I even
  fancied&mdash;bah! How much is Borrowdean giving you for this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; she answered, coolly. &ldquo;It is my own
  sincere desire for your welfare which has prompted all that I have said to
  you. I am ambitious for you, Lawrence. I should like to see you Prime
  Minister. I am sure you could be if you tried. You are letting your talents
  rust, and I don&rsquo;t approve of it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The faint note of mockery in her tone was clearly apparent. Mannering
  found it hard to answer her calmly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;put it into plain words. What does it
  mean? What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir Leslie tells me,&rdquo; she said, raising her eyes and looking
  him in the face, &ldquo;that his party is prepared to find you a safe seat
  to- morrow. I want you to give up your hermit&rsquo;s life and accept
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And the alternative?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have it already before you. Your reception of it was not, I
  must admit, altogether flattering.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am allowed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;some short space of time for
  consideration?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Until to-morrow, if you wish,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I imagine
  you know pretty well what you mean to do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He picked up his hat and turned towards the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I suppose I do!&rdquo;</p>

  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2>I. &mdash; BORROWDEAN MAKES A BARGAIN</h2>

  <p>Borrowdean sank into the chair which Berenice had indicated, with a little
  sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;These all-night sittings,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;get less of a
  joke as one advances in years. You read the reports this morning?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And Mannering&rsquo;s speech?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Every word of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Our little conspiracy,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is bearing
  fruit. Honestly, Mannering is a surprise, even to me. After these years of
  rust I scarcely expected him to step back at once into all his former
  brilliancy. His speech last night was wonderful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I heard it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are quite right. It was
  wonderful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You were in the House?&rdquo; he asked, looking up quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was there till midnight,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

  <p>Borrowdean was thoughtful for a moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His speech,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;sounded even better than it
  read.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;He has all the smaller
  tricks of the orator, as well as the gift of eloquence. One can always listen
  to him with pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you pardon me,&rdquo; Borrowdean asked, &ldquo;if I make a
  remark which may sound a little impertinent? You and Mannering were great
  friends at Blakely. On my first visit there you will remember that you did
  not attempt to conceal that there was more than an ordinary intimacy between
  you. Yet to-day I notice that there are indications on both your parts of a
  desire to avoid one another as much as possible. It seems to me a pity that
  you two should not be friends. Is there any small misunderstanding which a
  common friend&mdash;such as I trust I may call myself&mdash;might help to
  smooth away?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice regarded him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you should talk to me
  like this, you who are certainly responsible for any estrangement there may
  be between Mr. Mannering and myself. Please answer me this question. Why do
  you wish us to be friends?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You and he and myself, with about a dozen others,&rdquo; he
  answered, &ldquo;form the backbone of a political party. As time goes on we
  shall in all probability be drawn closer and closer together. It seems to me
  best that our alliance should be as real a thing as possible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rather a sentimental attitude for you, Sir Leslie,&rdquo; she
  remarked. &ldquo;Have you ever considered the fact that any coolness there
  may be between Lawrence Mannering and myself is entirely due to
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To me!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Exactly! At Blakely we were on terms of the most intimate
  friendship. I had grown to like and respect him more than any man I had ever
  met. I don&rsquo;t know exactly why I should take you so far into my
  confidence, but I am inclined to do so. Our friendship seemed likely to
  develop into&mdash;other things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Duchess&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt me! I have an idea that you were perfectly
  aware of it. Perhaps it did not suit your plans. At any rate, you made
  statements to me concerning him which, as you very well knew, were likely to
  alter my entire opinion of him. I had an idea that there was some code of
  honour between men which kept them from discussing the private life of their
  friends with a woman. You seem to have been troubled with no such scruples.
  You told me things about Lawrence Mannering which made it absolutely
  necessary that I should hear them confirmed or denied from his own
  lips.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You would rather have remained in ignorance, then?&rdquo; he
  asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would rather have remained in ignorance,&rdquo; she repeated,
  calmly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t flatter yourself, Sir Leslie, that a woman ever
  has any real gratitude in her heart for the person who, out of friendship, or
  some other motive, destroys her ideals. I should have married Lawrence
  Mannering if you had not spoken.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean was silent. In his heart he was thinking how nearly one of the
  most cherished schemes of his life had gone awry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that even at the risk of
  your further displeasure I have no regrets to offer you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not desire your regrets,&rdquo; she answered, scornfully.
  &ldquo;You did what it suited you to do, and I presume you are satisfied. As
  for the rest, I can assure you that the relations between Mr. Mannering and
  myself are such that the balance of your political apple-cart is not likely
  to be disturbed. Now let us talk of something else. I have said all that I
  have to say on this matter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir Leslie was not entirely satisfied with the result of his afternoon
  call. He walked slowly from Grosvenor Square to a small house in Sloane
  Gardens, in front of which a well-appointed victoria was waiting. He looked
  around at the well-filled window-boxes, thick with geraniums and marguerites,
  at the coachman&rsquo;s new livery, at the evidences of luxury which met him
  the moment the door was opened, and his lips parted in a faint, unpleasant
  smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor Mannering,&rdquo; he murmured to himself. &ldquo;What a
  millstone!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mrs. Phillimore was at home. She would certainly see Sir Leslie, the trim
  parlour-maid thought, with a smile. She left him alone in a flower-scented
  drawing-room, crowded with rococo furniture and many knick- knacks, where he
  waited more or less impatiently for nearly twenty minutes. Then Mrs.
  Phillimore swept into the room, elaborately gowned for her drive in the park,
  dispersing perfumes in all directions and bestowing a dazzling smile upon
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I felt very much inclined not to see you at all,&rdquo; she
  declared. &ldquo;How dared you keep away from me all this time? You
  haven&rsquo;t been near me since I moved in here. What do you think of my
  little house?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Charming!&rdquo; he declared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Every one likes it,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;Such a time I had
  choosing the furniture. Hester wouldn&rsquo;t help with a single thing. You
  know that she has left me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I understood that she had gone to Mr. Mannering as
  secretary,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;She has done typing for him for some
  time, hasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mrs. Phillimore nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Worships him, the little fool!&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;I must
  admit I detest clever men. You are all so dull, and such scheming brutes,
  too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean smiled. A certain rough-and-ready humour about this woman
  always appealed to him. He looked around.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You seem to have done very nicely with that little offering,&rdquo;
  he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, ready money goes a long way,&rdquo; she declared,
  carelessly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And when it is spent?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Five thousand pounds
  is not an inexhaustible sum.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By the time it is spent,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;your party
  will be in, and I suppose you will make Lawrence something.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean regarded the woman thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has it ever occurred to you,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that the time
  is likely to come when Mannering might want his money for himself? He might
  want to marry, for instance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laughed mirthlessly, but without a shade of uneasiness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know Lawrence,&rdquo; she declared, scornfully.
  &ldquo;He&rsquo;d never do that whilst I was alive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not so sure,&rdquo; Borrowdean answered, calmly.
  &ldquo;Between ourselves, I cannot see that your claim upon him amounts to
  very much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re a fool!&rdquo; she declared, brusquely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; Borrowdean assured her, blandly.
  &ldquo;Now I fancy that I could tell you something which would surprise you
  very much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has he been making love to any one?&rdquo; she asked, quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Something of the sort,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Mannering is
  quixotic, of course, and that hermit life of his down in Norfolk has made him
  more so. Now he has come back again into the world it is just possible that
  he may see things differently. I flatter myself that I am a man of common
  sense. I know how the whole affair seems to me, and I tell you frankly that I
  can see nothing from the point of view of honour to prevent Mannering
  marrying any woman he chooses. I think it very possible that he may readjust
  his whole point of view.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The woman looked around her, and outside, where her victoria was waiting.
  At last she had attained to an environment such as she had all her life
  desired. The very idea that at any moment it might be swept away sent a cold
  shiver through her. Borrowdean had a trick of speaking convincingly. And
  besides&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is the woman?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had been wondering,&rdquo; Borrowdean said, &ldquo;whether it
  would not be better to tell you, so that you might be on your guard. The
  woman is the Duchess of Lenchester.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She stared at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in earnest?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her face hardened. Whatever other feelings she may have had for Mannering,
  she had lived so long with the thought that he belonged to her, at least as a
  wage-earning animal, a person whose province it was to make her ways smooth
  so far as his means permitted, that the thought of losing him stirred in her
  a dull, jealous anger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d stop it!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d go and
  tell her everything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not sure,&rdquo; Borrowdean continued, smoothly, &ldquo;that
  that would be the best course. Supposing that you were to tell her the story
  just as you told it to me. It is just possible that her point of view might
  be mine. She might regard Lawrence Mannering as a quixotic person, and
  endeavour to persuade him that your claim was scarcely so binding as he seems
  to imagine. In any case, I do not think that your story would prevent her
  marrying him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then all I can say is that she is a woman with a very queer sense
  of right and wrong,&rdquo; Mrs. Phillimore declared, angrily.</p>

  <p>Borrowdean smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A woman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who is fond of a man is apt to have
  her judgment a little warped. The Duchess is a woman of fine perceptions and
  sound judgment. But she is attracted by Lawrence Mannering. She admires him.
  He is the sort of person who appeals to her imagination. These feelings might
  easily become, if they have not already developed into, something else. And I
  tell you again that I do not believe your story would stop her from marrying
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She leaned a little towards him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What would?&rdquo; she asked, earnestly.</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think I could tell you
  that!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She held up her hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop, please,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to ask you something
  else. Are you Lawrence&rsquo;s enemy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I? Why, of course not!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then where do you come in?&rdquo; she asked, bluntly. &ldquo;You
  couldn&rsquo;t persuade me that it is interest on my account which brings you
  here and makes you tell me these things. You don&rsquo;t care a button for
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean took her hand and leaned forward in his chair. She snatched it
  away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, rot!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I may be a fool, but
  I&rsquo;m not quite fool enough for that. I&rsquo;m simply a useful person
  for the moment in some scheme of yours, and I just want to know what that
  scheme is. That&rsquo;s all! I&rsquo;m not the sort of woman you&rsquo;d
  waste a moment with, except for some purpose of your own. You&rsquo;ve proved
  that. You wormed my story out of me very cleverly, but I haven&rsquo;t quite
  forgotten it yet, you know. And to tell you the truth,&rdquo; she continued,
  &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not my sort, either. You and Lawrence Mannering are
  something of the same kidney after all, though he&rsquo;s worth a dozen of
  you. You&rsquo;ve neither of you any time for play in the world, and that
  sort of man doesn&rsquo;t appeal to me. Now where do you come in?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean looked at her thoughtfully. He had the air of a man a trifle
  piqued. Perhaps for the first time he realized that Blanche Phillimore was
  not altogether an unattractive-looking woman. If she had desired to stir him
  from his indifference she could not have chosen any more effectual means.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not going to argue with you,&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;I
  have ambitions, it is true, and the world is not exactly a playground for me.
  Nevertheless, I am not an ascetic like Mannering. The world, the flesh and
  the devil are very much to me what they are to other men. But in a sense you
  have cornered me, and you shall have the truth. I want to marry the Duchess
  of Lenchester myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now we know where we
  are. You want to marry the Duchess, and therefore you don&rsquo;t want her to
  have Lawrence. You think that I can stop it, and as I don&rsquo;t want him
  married, either, you come to me. That is reasonable. Now how can I prevent
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By a slight variation from your story,&rdquo; he answered.
  &ldquo;In fact, words are not needed. A suggestion only would be enough, and
  circumstances,&rdquo; he added, glancing around, &ldquo;are strongly in
  favour of that suggestion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mannering is security for your lease,&rdquo; he remarked.
  &ldquo;You pay in his cheques to your bank every quarter. He occupies just
  that position which in a general way is capable of one explanation
  only.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let the Duchess believe him, or continue to believe him, to be an
  ordinary man&mdash;instead of a fool&mdash;and she will never marry
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And she will you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope so!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She leaned back in her chair. He could not altogether understand her
  silence. Surely she could have no scruples?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;that I am to play
  your game for nothing. I don&rsquo;t care so very much, after all, if he
  marries. He&rsquo;d settle all he could on me. In fact, I should have just as
  much claim on him as I have now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did not say that you should play it for nothing,&rdquo; he
  answered. &ldquo;I want us to understand each other, because I have an idea
  that you may be seeing something of the Duchess at any moment. Let us put it
  this way. Suppose I promise to give you a diamond necklace of the value of,
  say five thousand pounds, the day I marry the Duchess!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She rose and put pen and paper before him. He shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t put an arrangement of that sort on paper,&rdquo; he
  protested. &ldquo;You must rely upon my word of honour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She held out the pen to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On paper, or the whole thing is off absolutely,&rdquo; she
  declared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t trust me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much honour about an arrangement of this sort, is
  there?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It has to be on paper, or not at
  all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A carriage stopped outside. They heard the bell.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;may be the Duchess of
  Lenchester.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He caught up the pen and wrote a few hurried lines. The smile with which
  he handed it to her was not altogether successful.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After all, you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there should be honour
  amongst thieves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No doubt there is,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Only thieves are a
  cut above us, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo; Borrowdean said to himself, as he
  reached the pavement, &ldquo;that that woman is such a fool as she
  seems.&rdquo;</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b202"
     name="ref-b202"></a>II. &mdash; &ldquo;CHERCHEZ LA FEMME&rdquo;</h2>

  <p>Mannering hated dinner parties, but this one had been a necessity.
  Nevertheless, if he had known who his companion for the evening was fated to
  be he would most certainly have stayed away. Her first question showed him
  that she had no intention of ignoring memories which to him were charged with
  the most subtle pain.</p>

  <p>He looked down the table, and back again into her face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is different. We
  cannot compare. We can judge only by effect&mdash;the effect upon
  ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can you be analytical and yet remain within the orbit of my
  understanding?&rdquo; she asked, with a faint smile. &ldquo;If so, I should
  like to know exactly how you feel about it all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He passed a course with a somewhat weary gesture of refusal, and leaned
  back in his chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are comprehensive&mdash;as usual,&rdquo; he remarked.
  &ldquo;Just then I was wondering whether the perfume of these banks of
  hot-house flowers&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what they are&mdash;was as sweet
  as the odour of the salt from the creeks, or my roses when the night wind
  touched them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You were wondering! And what have you decided?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, I must not say. In any case you would not agree with me.
  Wasn&rsquo;t it you who once scoffed at my idyll in the
  wilderness?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not think that I believe in idylls, nowadays,&rdquo; she
  answered. &ldquo;One risks so many disappointments when one believes in
  anything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You did not talk like this at Blakely,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am nearly a year older,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and a year
  wiser.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You pain me,&rdquo; he answered, with a little sigh. &ldquo;You are
  a person of intelligence, and you talk of growing wiser with the years.
  Don&rsquo;t you know that the only supreme wisdom is the wisdom of the child?
  Our inherent ignorance is fed and nourished by experience.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are hiding yourself,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;behind a fence
  of words&mdash;words that mean less than nothing! I don&rsquo;t suppose that
  even you would hesitate to admit that you have come into a larger world. You
  may have to pay for it. We all do. But at any rate it is an atmosphere which
  breeds men.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And changes women,&rdquo; he murmured, under his breath.</p>

  <p>She did not speak to him for several moments. Then the alteration in her
  tone and manner was almost marked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mentioned Blakely a few minutes ago,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
  wonder whether you remember our discussion there upon precisely what has come
  to pass.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I remember that in those days,&rdquo; she continued, reflectively,
  &ldquo;you were very firm indeed, or was it my poor arguments that were at
  fault? Your vegetable and sentimental existence was a part of yourself.
  Ambition! You had forgotten what it was. Duty! You spouted individualism by
  the hour. Gratify my curiosity, won&rsquo;t you? Tell me what made you change
  your mind?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering was silent for a moment. A close observer might have noticed a
  certain alteration in his face. A touch of the coming weariness was already
  there.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have never changed my mind,&rdquo; he answered, quietly.
  &ldquo;My inclinations to-day are what they have always been.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She dropped her voice a little.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You puzzle me,&rdquo; she said, softly. &ldquo;Do you mean that it
  was your sense of duty which was awakened?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I do not mean that,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Forgive
  me&mdash;but I cannot tell you what I do mean. Circumstances brought me here
  against my will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You talk like a slave,&rdquo; she said, lightly enough. She, too,
  was brave. She drank wine to keep the colour in her cheeks, and she told
  herself that the pain at her heart was nothing. Nevertheless, some words of
  Borrowdean&rsquo;s were mocking her all the while.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are all slaves,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The folly of it all
  is when we stop to think. Then we realize it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Their conversation was like a strangled thing. Neither made any serious
  effort to re-establish it. It was a great dinner party, chiefly political,
  and long drawn out. Afterwards came a reception, and Mannering was at once
  surrounded. It was nearly midnight when by chance they came face to face
  again. She touched him with her fan, and leaned aside from the little group
  by whom she was surrounded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you very much occupied, Mr. Mannering,&rdquo; she asked,
  lightly, &ldquo;or could you spare me a moment?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stopped short. Whatever surprise he may have felt he concealed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am entirely at your service, Duchess,&rdquo; he answered.
  &ldquo;Mr. Harrison will excuse me, I am sure,&rdquo; he added, turning to
  his companion.</p>

  <p>She rested her fingers upon his arm. The house belonged to a relative of
  hers, and she knew where to find a quiet spot. When they were alone she did
  not hesitate for a moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lawrence,&rdquo; she said, quietly, &ldquo;will you imagine for a
  moment that we are back again at Blakely?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would to God we were!&rdquo; he answered, impulsively.
  &ldquo;That is&mdash;if you wish it too!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She did not answer at once. The sudden abnegation of his reserve took her
  by surprise. She had to readjust her words.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there are many things about
  Blakely which I regret all the time. You know, of course, the chief one, our
  own altered selves. I know, Lawrence, that I need to ask your forgiveness. I
  came there under an assumed name, and I will admit that my coming was part of
  a scheme between Ronalds, Rochester and myself. Well, I am ready to ask your
  forgiveness for that. I don&rsquo;t think you ought to refuse it me. It
  doesn&rsquo;t alter anything that happened. It doesn&rsquo;t even affect it.
  You must believe that!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe it, if you tell me so,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do tell you,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I can explain it all. I
  am longing to have it all off my mind. But first of all, there is just one
  thing which I want to ask you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His face as he looked towards her gave her almost a shock. Very little was
  left of his healthy colouring. Already there were lines under his eyes, and
  he was certainly thinner. And there was something else which almost appalled
  her. There was fear in his manner. He sat like a man waiting for sentence, a
  man fore-doomed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want to know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what has brought
  you&mdash;here. I want to know what manner of persuasion has
  prevailed&mdash;when mine was so ineffectual. Don&rsquo;t think that I am not
  glad that you decided as you did. I am glad&mdash;very. You are in your
  rightful place, and I am only too thankful to hear about you, and
  read&mdash;and watch. But&mdash;we are jealous creatures, we women, you know,
  and I want to know whose and what arguments prevailed, when mine were so very
  insufficient.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He answered her without hesitation, but his tone was dull and
  spiritless.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a short silence. She gathered her skirts for a moment in her
  hand as though about to rise, but apparently changed her mind. She waited for
  some time, and then she spoke again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps you think that I ought not to ask?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked at her hopelessly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think that. You have a right to ask. But it
  doesn&rsquo;t alter things, does it? I can&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You asked me to marry you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was at Blakely. We were so far out of the world&mdash;such a
  different world. I think that I had forgotten all that I wished to forget.
  Everything seemed possible there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean that you would have married me and told me nothing of
  circumstances in your life, so momentous that they have practically exercised
  in this matter of your return to politics a compelling influence over
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I should not have told
  you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His unhappiness moved her. She still lingered. She drew a little breath,
  and she went a good deal further than she had meant to go.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It has been suggested to me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that your
  reappearance was due to a woman&rsquo;s influence. Is this true?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A woman had something to do with it,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Her name,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;is Blanche Phillimore. It was
  the person to whom you yourself alluded.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Duchess maintained her self-control. She was quite pale, however, and
  her tone was growing ominously harder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is she a connection of yours?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is there anything which you could tell me about her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yet at her bidding you have done&mdash;what you refused
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had no choice! Borrowdean saw to that,&rdquo; he remarked,
  bitterly.</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet. She was pale, and her lips were quivering, but she
  was splendidly handsome.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What sort of a man are you, Lawrence Mannering?&rdquo; she asked,
  steadily. &ldquo;You play at idealism, you asked me to marry you. Yet all the
  time there was this background.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was madness,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But remember it was Mrs.
  Handsell whom I asked to be my wife.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What difference does that make? She was a woman, too, I suppose, to
  be honoured&mdash;or insulted&mdash;by your choice!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There was no question of insult, I think.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at him steadfastly. Perhaps for a moment her thoughts travelled
  back to those unforgotten days in the rose-gardens at Blakely, to the man
  whose delicate but wholesome joy in the wind and the sun and the flowers, the
  sea-stained marshes and the windy knolls where they had so often stood
  together, she could not forget. His life had seemed to her then so beautiful
  a thing. The elementary purity of his thoughts and aspirations were
  unmistakable. She told herself passionately that there must be a way out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lawrence,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we are man and woman, not boy and
  girl. You asked me to marry you once, and I hesitated, only because of one
  thing. I do not wish to look into any hidden chambers of your life. I wish to
  know nothing, save of the present. What claim has this woman Blanche
  Phillimore upon you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is her secret,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;not mine
  alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She lives in your house&mdash;through her you are a poor
  man&mdash;through her you are back again, a worker in the world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It must always be so?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you have nothing more to say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I dared,&rdquo; he said, raising his eyes to hers, &ldquo;I
  would say&mdash;trust me! I am not exactly&mdash;one of the beasts of the
  field.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you not trust me, then? I am not a foolish girl. I am a woman.
  You may destroy an ideal, but there would be something left.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can tell you no more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then it is to be good-bye?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you say so!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She turned slowly away. He watched her disappear. Afterwards, with a
  curious sense of unreality, he remained quite still, his eyes still fixed
  upon the portiere through which she had passed.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b203"
     name="ref-b203"></a>III. &mdash; ONE OF THE &ldquo;SUFFERERS&rdquo;</h2>

  <p>Mannering kept no carriage, and he left Downing Street on foot. The little
  house which he had taken furnished for the season was in the somewhat less
  pretentious neighborhood of Portland Crescent, and as there were no hansoms
  within hail he started to walk home. An attempt at a short cut landed him
  presently in a neighborhood which he failed to recognize. He paused, looking
  about him for some one from whom to inquire the way. Then he at once realized
  what he had already more than once suspected. He was being followed.</p>

  <p>The footsteps ceased as he himself had halted. It was a wet night, and the
  street was ill-lit. Nevertheless, Mannering could distinguish the figure of a
  man standing in the shadows of the houses, apparently to escape observation.
  For a moment he hesitated. His follower could scarcely be an ordinary
  hooligan, for not more than fifty yards away were the lights of a great
  thoroughfare, and even in this street, quiet though it was, there were people
  passing to and fro. His curiosity prompted him to subterfuge. He took a
  cigarette from his case, and commenced in a leisurely manner the operation of
  striking a light. Instantly the figure of the man began to move cautiously
  towards him.</p>

  <p>Mannering&rsquo;s eyes and hearing, keenly developed by his country life,
  apprised him of every step the man took. He heard him pause whilst a couple
  of women passed on the other side of the way. Afterwards his approach became
  swifter and more stealthy. Barely in time to avoid, he scarcely knew what,
  Mannering turned sharply round.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you want with me?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

  <p>The man showed no signs of confusion. Mannering, as he looked sternly into
  his face, lost all fear of personal assault. He was neatly but shabbily
  dressed, pale, and with a slight red moustache. He had a somewhat broad
  forehead, eyes with more than an ordinary lustre, and, in somewhat striking
  contradiction to the rest of his features, a large sensitive mouth with a
  distinctly humorous curve. Even now its corners were receding into a smile,
  which had in it, however, other elements than mirth alone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are Mr. Lawrence Mannering?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is my name,&rdquo; Mannering answered, &ldquo;but if you want
  to speak to me why don&rsquo;t you come up like a man, instead of dogging my
  footsteps? It looked as though you wanted to take me by surprise. What is
  that you are hiding up your sleeve?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man held it out, placed it even in Mannering&rsquo;s hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A life preserver, steel, as you see, and with a beautiful spring.
  Deadly weapon, isn&rsquo;t it, sir? Even a half-hearted sort of blow might
  kill a man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering swung the weapon lightly in his hand. It cut the air with a
  soft, sickly swish.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What were you doing following me, on tiptoe, with this in your
  hand?&rdquo; he asked, sternly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the man answered, as though forced to confess an
  unpleasant truth, &ldquo;I am very much afraid that I was going to hit you
  with it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering looked up and down the street for a policeman.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And may I ask why you changed your
  mind?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was an inspiration,&rdquo; the man answered, easily. &ldquo;To
  tell you the truth, the clumsiness of the whole thing grated very much upon
  me. Personally, I ran no risk, don&rsquo;t think it was that. My escape was
  very carefully provided for. But one thinks quickly in moments of excitement,
  and it seemed to me as I took those last few steps that I saw a better
  way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A better way,&rdquo; Mannering repeated, puzzled. &ldquo;I am
  afraid I don&rsquo;t quite understand you. I presume that you meant to rob
  me. You would not have found it worth while, by the bye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man laughed softly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;do I look like a robber?
  Rumour says that you are a poor man. I should think it very likely that,
  although I am not a rich one, I am at least as well off as you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering looked out no more for the policeman. He was getting
  interested.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should like to understand what all
  this means. You were going to tap me on the head with this particularly
  unpleasant weapon, and your motive was not robbery. I am not aware of ever
  having seen you before. I am not aware of having an enemy in the world.
  Explain yourself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should be charmed,&rdquo; the man answered. &ldquo;I do not wish
  to keep you standing here, however. Will you allow me to walk with you
  towards your home? You can retain possession of that little trifle, if you
  like,&rdquo; he added, pointing to the weapon which was still in
  Mannering&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I can assure you that I have nothing else of
  the sort in my possession. You can feel my pockets, if you like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will take your word!&rdquo; Mannering said. &ldquo;I was on my
  way to Portland Crescent, but I fancy that I have taken a wrong
  turn.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We can get there this way,&rdquo; the man answered. &ldquo;Excuse
  me one second.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He paused, and lit a cigarette. Then with his hands behind his back he
  stepped out by Mannering&rsquo;s side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What was that you said just now?&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;that
  you were not aware of having an enemy in the world? My dear sir, there was
  never a more extraordinary delusion. I should seriously doubt whether in the
  whole of the United Kingdom there is a man who has more. I know myself of a
  million or so who would welcome the news of your death to- morrow. I know of
  a select few who have opened, and will open their newspapers to-morrow, and
  for the next few days, in the hope of seeing your obituary notice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A light commenced to break in upon Mannering. He looked towards his
  companion incredulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean political opponents!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Is that
  what you are driving at all the time?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man laughed softly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;excuse me, Mr.
  Mannering&mdash;you remind me irresistibly of <i>Punch&rsquo;s</i> cartoon
  last week&mdash;the ostrich politician with his head in the sand. You have
  thrust yours very deep down indeed, when you talk of political opponents. Do
  you know what they call you in the North, sir?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The enemy of the people! It isn&rsquo;t a pleasant title, is
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a false one!&rdquo; Mannering declared, with a little note of
  passion quivering in his tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is as true and certain as the judgment of God!&rdquo; his
  companion answered, with almost lightning-like rapidity.</p>

  <p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. They passed a lamp- post, and
  Mannering, turning his head, scrutinized the other&rsquo;s features
  closely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should like to know who you are,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and what
  your name is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a reasonable curiosity,&rdquo; the man answered. &ldquo;My
  name is Fardell, Richard Fardell, and I am a retired bookmaker.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A bookmaker!&rdquo; Mannering repeated, incredulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Precisely. I should imagine from what I know of you, Mr. Mannering,
  that my occupation, or rather my late occupation, is not one which would
  appeal to you favourably. Very likely not! I don&rsquo;t see why it should
  myself. But at any rate, it taught me a lot about my fellow men. I did my
  business in shillings and half-crowns, you see. Did it with the working
  classes, the sort who used to go to a race-meeting for a jaunt, and just have
  a bit on for the sake of the sport. Took their missus generally, and made a
  holiday of it, and if they lost they&rsquo;d grin and come and chaff me, and
  if they won they&rsquo;d spend the money like lords. I made money, of course,
  bought houses, and made a lot more. Then business fell off. I didn&rsquo;t
  seem to meet with that cheerful holiday-making crew at any of the meetings up
  in the North, and I got sick of it. You see, I&rsquo;d made sort of friends
  with them. They all knew Dicky Fardell, and I knew hundreds of &lsquo;em by
  sight. They&rsquo;d come and mob me to stand &lsquo;em a drink when the wrong
  horse won, and I can tell you I never refused. They were always
  good-tempered, real sports to the backbone, and I tell you I was fond of
  &lsquo;em. And then they left off coming. I couldn&rsquo;t understand it at
  first. The one or two who came talked of bad trade, and when I asked after
  their pals they shook their heads. They betted in shillings instead of
  half-crowns, and I didn&rsquo;t like the look of their faces when they lost.
  I tell you, it got so at last that I used to watch for the horse they&rsquo;d
  put their bit on to win, and feel kind o&rsquo; sick when it didn&rsquo;t.
  You can imagine I couldn&rsquo;t stand that sort of thing long. I chucked it,
  and I went to look for my pals. I wanted to find out what had become of
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You found, I hope,&rdquo; he said, drily, &ldquo;that the British
  workman had discovered a better investment for his shillings and half-crowns
  than the race-course.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Richard Fardell smiled pleasantly, but tolerantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you, meaning no
  offence, Mr. Mannering, know nothing about the British workman. Whatever else
  he may be, he&rsquo;s a sportsman. He&rsquo;ll look after his wife and kids
  as well as the best of them, but he&rsquo;ll have his bit of sport so long as
  he&rsquo;s got a copper in his pocket. When he didn&rsquo;t come I put my kit
  on one side and went to look for him. I went, mind you, as his friend, and
  knowing a bit about him. And what I found has made a changed man of
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid things are bad up in the North,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t think that we people who are responsible for the
  laws of the country ignore this, Mr. Fardell. It is a very anxious time
  indeed with all of us. Still, I presume you study the monthly trade returns.
  Some industries seem prosperous enough.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no politician,&rdquo; Fardell answered, curtly.
  &ldquo;Figures don&rsquo;t interest me. They&rsquo;re just the drugs some of
  your party use to keep your conscience quiet. Things I see and know of are
  what I go by. And what I&rsquo;ve seen, and what I know of, are just about
  enough to tear the heart out of any man who cares a row of pins about his
  fellows. Now I&rsquo;m going to talk plain English to you, Mr. Mannering. I
  bought that little article you have in your pocket seriously meaning to knock
  you on the head with it. And that may come yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering looked at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But my dear sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what is your grievance
  against me? I have always considered myself a people&rsquo;s
  politician.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then the people may very well say &lsquo;save me from my
  friends&rsquo;,&rdquo; Fardell answered, grimly. &ldquo;Mind, I believe
  you&rsquo;re honest, or you&rsquo;d be lying on your back now with a cracked
  skull. But you are using a great influence on the wrong side. You&rsquo;re
  standing between the people and the one reasonable scheme which has been
  brought forward which has a fair chance of changing their
  condition.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then Mannering began to understand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I oppose the scheme you speak of,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;simply
  because I don&rsquo;t believe in it. Every man has a right to his opinion. I
  don&rsquo;t believe for a moment that it would improve the present condition
  of things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then what is your scheme?&rdquo; Fardell asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My scheme!&rdquo; Mannering repeated. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite
  understand you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Fardell answered, vigourously.
  &ldquo;You can weave academic arguments, you can make figures and statistics
  dance to any damned tune you please. If I tried to argue with you,
  you&rsquo;d squash me flat. And what&rsquo;s it all come to? My pals must
  starve for the gratification of your intellectual vanity. You won&rsquo;t
  listen to Tariff Reform. Then what do you propose, to light the forges and
  fill the mills? Nothing! I say, unless you&rsquo;ve got a counter scheme of
  your own, you ought to try ours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come, Mr. Fardell,&rdquo; Mannering said, &ldquo;I can assure you
  that all I have said and written is the outcome of honest thought.
  I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Fardell exclaimed. &ldquo;Honest thought! Yes! Where?
  In your study. That&rsquo;s where you theorists do your mischief. You
  can&rsquo;t make laws for the people in your study. You can&rsquo;t tell the
  status of the workingman from the figures you read in your study.
  You&rsquo;re like half the smug people in the world who discuss this question
  in the railway carriages and in their clubs. I&rsquo;ve heard &lsquo;em till
  I&rsquo;d like to shove their self-opinionated arguments down their throats,
  strip their clothes off their backs, and send them down to live with my pals,
  or starve with them. Any little idiot who buys a penny paper and who&rsquo;s
  doing pretty well for himself, thinks he can lay down the law about Free
  Trade. You&rsquo;re all of one kidney, sir! You none of you realize this.
  There are men as good as any of you, whose wives and children are as dear to
  them as yours to you, who&rsquo;ve got to see them get thinner and thinner,
  who don&rsquo;t know where to get a day&rsquo;s work or lay their hands upon
  a copper, and all the while their kids come crying to them for something to
  eat. Put yourself in their place, sir, and try and realize the torture of it.
  I&rsquo;ve been amongst &lsquo;em. I&rsquo;ve spent half of what I made, and
  a good many thousands it was, buying food for them. Can you wonder that my
  fingers have itched for the throats of these smug, prosperous pigs, who spurt
  platitudes and think things are very well as they are because they&rsquo;re
  making their little bit? What right have you&mdash;any of you&mdash;to
  hesitate for a second to try any means to help those poor devils, unless
  you&rsquo;ve got a better scheme of your own? Will you tell me that,
  sir?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They had reached Mannering&rsquo;s house, and he threw open the gate.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must come in with me and talk about these things,&rdquo;
  Mannering said, gravely. &ldquo;You seem to be the sort of person I&rsquo;ve
  been wanting to meet for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="b204"
     name="ref-b204"></a>IV. &mdash; DEBTS OF HONOUR</h2>

  <p>Berenice found the following morning a note from Borrowdean, which caused
  her some perplexity.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;If you really care,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to do
  Mannering a good turn, look his niece up now and then. I am afraid that young
  woman has rather lost her head since she came to London, and she is making
  friends who will do her no particular good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice ordered her carriage early, and drove round to Portland
  Crescent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; she exclaimed, as Clara came into the room,
  &ldquo;what have you been doing with yourself? You look ghastly!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Clara shrugged her shoulders, and looked at herself in a mirror.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do look chippy, don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; she remarked.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been spending the week-end down at Bristow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At Bristow?&rdquo; Berenice repeated. Her voice spoke volumes.
  Clara looked up a little defiantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes! We had an awful spree! I like it there immensely,
  only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice looked up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I notice,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;that there is generally an
  &lsquo;only&rsquo; about people who have spent week-ends at Bristow. They
  play cards there, don&rsquo;t they, until daylight? Some one once told me
  that they kept a professional croupier for roulette!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That horrid game!&rdquo; Clara exclaimed. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t
  mention it. I&rsquo;ve scarcely slept a wink all night for thinking of
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice looked at her in surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; she inquired, deliberately, &ldquo;that
  they allowed you to play&mdash;and lose?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t their fault I lost,&rdquo; Clara answered.
  &ldquo;Oh, what a fool I was. Bobby Bristow showed me a system. It seemed so
  easy. I didn&rsquo;t think I could possibly lose. It worked beautifully at
  first. I thought that I was going to pay all my bills, and have lots of money
  to spend. Then I doubled the stakes&mdash;I wanted to win a lot&mdash;and
  everything went wrong!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How much did you lose?&rdquo; Berenice asked. Clara shivered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Sir Leslie Borrowdean
  gave his own cheques for all my I.O.U.&lsquo;s. He is coming to see me some
  time to-day. I don&rsquo;t know what I shall say to him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean to go on playing?&rdquo; Berenice asked, quietly,
  &ldquo;or is this experience enough for you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall never sit at a roulette table again as long as I
  live,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I hate the very thought of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you can just ask Sir Leslie the amount of the I.O.U.&lsquo;s,
  and tell him that he shall have a cheque in the morning,&rdquo; Berenice
  said. &ldquo;I will lend you the money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Clara gave a little gasp.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are too kind,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
  know when I shall be able to repay you. It is&mdash;nearly three hundred
  pounds!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So long as you keep your word,&rdquo; Berenice answered, &ldquo;and
  do not play again, you need never let that trouble you. You shall have the
  cheque before two o&rsquo;clock. No, please don&rsquo;t thank me. If you take
  my advice you won&rsquo;t spend another week-end at Bristow. It is not a fit
  house for young girls. How is your uncle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him this morning,&rdquo; Clara answered.
  &ldquo;Perkins told me that he came home after midnight with a man whom he
  seemed to have picked up in the street, and they were in the study talking
  till nearly five this morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice rose.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I came to see if you would care to drive down to Ranelagh with me
  this morning,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but you are evidently fit for nothing
  except to go back to bed again. I won&rsquo;t forget the cheque, and remember
  me to your uncle. By the bye, where&rsquo;s that nice young man who used to
  be always with you down in the country?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must mean Mr. Lindsay,&rdquo; Clara answered. &ldquo;I have no
  idea. At Blakely, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I were you,&rdquo; Berenice said, as she rose, &ldquo;I should
  write to him to come up and look after you. You need it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded pleasantly and took her leave. Clara threw herself into a chair
  and rang the bell.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perkins,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have had no sleep and no
  breakfast. What should you recommend?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An egg beaten up in milk, miss,&rdquo; the man suggested,
  &ldquo;same as I&rsquo;ve just taken Mr. Mannering.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is my uncle up?&rdquo; Clara asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not yet, miss,&rdquo; the man answered; &ldquo;He is just
  dressing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Clara nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well. Please get me what you said, and if Sir Leslie
  Borrowdean calls I want to see him at once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir Leslie is in the study now, miss,&rdquo; the man answered.
  &ldquo;I showed him in there because I thought he would want to see Mr.
  Mannering, but he asked for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you say that I shall be there in three minutes,&rdquo; Clara
  said.</p>

  <p>The three minutes became rather a long quarter of an hour, but Clara had
  used the time well. When she entered the library she had changed her dress,
  rearranged her hair, and by some means or another had lost her unnatural
  pallor. Sir Leslie greeted her a little gravely,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glad to see you looking so fit,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;They did
  us a bit too well down at Bristow, I thought. It&rsquo;s all very well for
  you children,&rdquo; he continued, with a smile, &ldquo;but when a man gets
  to my time of life he misses a night&rsquo;s rest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t call yourself old, Sir Leslie!&rdquo; she
  remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not young, although I like to think I am,&rdquo; he
  answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s pretty nearly a generation
  between us, Miss Clara. By the bye, where&rsquo;s your uncle this
  morning?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Getting up,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;He did not go to bed until
  after five, Perkins tells me. He brought some one home with him from
  Dorchester&rsquo;s reception, or some one he picked up afterwards, and they
  seem to have sat up talking all night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean was interested.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have no idea who it was, I suppose?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None at all. Perkins had never seen him before. When do you poor
  creatures get your holiday, Sir Leslie?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The session will be over in about three weeks,&rdquo; he answered,
  &ldquo;unless we defeat the Government before then. Your uncle has been
  hitting them very hard lately. I think before long we shall be in
  office.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Politics,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;seems to be rather a greedy sort
  of business. You are always trying to turn the other side out, aren&rsquo;t
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must remember,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;that politics is
  rather a one-sided sort of affair. The party which is in makes a very
  comfortable living out of it, and we who are out have to scrape along as best
  we can. Rather hard upon people like your uncle and myself, who are,
  comparatively speaking, poor men. That reminds me,&rdquo; he said, bringing
  out his pocket-book, &ldquo;I thought that I had better bring you these
  little documents.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Those horrid I.O.U.&lsquo;s,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I am sorry that you were so
  unlucky. I bought these from the bank, Miss Clara, as I thought you would not
  feel comfortable if you had to leave Bristow owing this money to
  strangers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was very thoughtful of you,&rdquo; she murmured. He changed his
  seat and came over to her side on the sofa.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you any idea how much they come to?&rdquo; he asked, smoothing
  them out upon his knee.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid to nearly three hundred pounds,&rdquo; she
  answered.</p>

  <p>He shook his head gravely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry to say that they come to a good deal more than
  that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hope you do not forget that I took the liberty
  of advising you more than once to stop. You had the most abominable
  luck.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;More than three hundred?&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;How much
  more?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They seem to add up to five hundred and eighty five pounds,&rdquo;
  he declared. &ldquo;I must confess that I was surprised myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&mdash;I think there must be some mistake,&rdquo; Clara
  faltered.</p>

  <p>He handed them to her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You had better look them through,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They seem
  all right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She took them in her hand, and looked at them helplessly. There was one
  there for fifty pounds which she tried in vain to remember&mdash;and how
  shaky her handwriting was. A sudden flood of recollection brought the colour
  into her cheeks. She remembered the long table, the men all smoking, the
  women most of them a little hard, a little too much in earnest&mdash;the soft
  click of the ball, the silent, sickening moments of suspense. Others had won
  or lost as much as she, but perhaps because she had been so much in earnest,
  her ill-luck had attracted some attention. She remembered Major
  Bristow&rsquo;s whispered offer, or rather suggestion, of help. Even now her
  cheeks burned at something in his tone or look.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she said, dolefully,
  &ldquo;only it&rsquo;s a lot more than I thought. I shall have three hundred
  pounds in the morning, but I&rsquo;ve no idea where to get the
  rest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are sure about the three hundred?&rdquo; Sir Leslie asked,
  quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I think that you had better let me lend you the rest, for the
  present,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;I am afraid your uncle would be rather
  annoyed to know that you had been gambling to such an extent. You may be able
  to think of some way of paying me back later on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked up at him hesitatingly. There was nothing in his manner which
  suggested in the least what Major Bristow had almost pronounced. She drew a
  little breath of relief. He was so much older, and after all, he was her
  uncle&rsquo;s friend.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can you really spare it, Sir Leslie?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I
  can&rsquo;t tell you how grateful I should be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked down at her with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can spare it for the present,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Only if
  you see any chance of paying me back before long, do so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will pardon my interference,&rdquo; said an ominously quiet
  voice from the doorway, &ldquo;but may I inquire into the nature of this
  transaction between you and my niece, Sir Leslie? Perhaps you had better
  explain it, Clara!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They both turned quickly round. Mannering was standing upon the threshold,
  the morning paper in his hand. Clara sank into a chair and covered her face
  with her hands. Sir Leslie shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>He was congratulating himself upon the discretion with which he had
  conducted the interview. He had for a few moments entertained other
  ideas.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will allow me to explain&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should prefer to hear my niece,&rdquo; Mannering answered,
  coldly.</p>

  <p>Clara looked up. She was pale and frightened, and she had hard work to
  choke down the sobs.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir Leslie was down at Bristow, where I was staying&mdash;this last
  week-end,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I lost a good deal of money there at
  roulette. He very kindly took up my I.O.U.&lsquo;s for me, and was offering
  when you came in to let it stand for a little time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is the amount?&rdquo; Mannering asked.</p>

  <p>Clara did not answer. Her head sank again. Her uncle repeated his inquiry.
  There was no note of anger in his tone. He might have been speaking of an
  altogether indifferent matter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid I shall have to trouble you to tell me the exact
  amount,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Perhaps, Borrowdean, you would be so good as
  to inform me, as my niece seems a little overcome.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The amount of the I.O.U.&lsquo;s for which I gave my cheque,&rdquo;
  Borrowdean said, &ldquo;was five hundred and eighty- seven pounds. I have the
  papers here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence for a moment or two. Clara looked up furtively,
  but she could learn nothing from her uncle&rsquo;s face. It was some time
  before he spoke. When at last he did, his voice was certainly a little lower
  and less distinct than usual.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did I understand you to say&mdash;five hundred and eighty- seven
  pounds?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is the amount,&rdquo; Borrowdean admitted. &ldquo;I trust that
  you do not consider my interference in any way officious, Mannering. I
  thought it best to settle the claims of perfect strangers against Miss
  Mannering.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; Mannering continued, &ldquo;in whose house my
  niece was permitted to lose this sum?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was at the Bristows&rsquo;,&rdquo; Clara answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And under whose chaperonage were you?&rdquo; Mannering asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lady Bristow&rsquo;s! She called for me here, and took me down last
  Friday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are these people who are generally accounted respectable?&rdquo;
  Mannering asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that Bristow is much better or worse than half
  of our country houses,&rdquo; Borrowdean answered. &ldquo;People who are at
  all in the swim must have excitement nowadays, you know. Bristow himself
  isn&rsquo;t very popular, but people go to the house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering made no further remark.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you will come into the study, Borrowdean,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;I will settle this matter with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your niece said something about having three hundred pounds,&rdquo;
  he remarked.</p>

  <p>Mannering glanced towards her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that that must be a mistake. My
  niece has no such sum at her command.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Clara rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You may as well know everything,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The
  Duchess of Lenchester came in and found me very unhappy this morning. I told
  her everything, and she offered to lend me the money. I told her then that it
  was only three hundred pounds. I thought that was all I owed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you made any other confidants?&rdquo; Mannering asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will return the Duchess&rsquo;s cheque,&rdquo; Mannering said.
  &ldquo;Borrowdean, will you come this way?&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a id="ref-b205"
     name="ref-b205"></a>V. &mdash; LOVE <small><i>VERSUS</i></small>
     POLITICS</h2>

  <p>Berenice was a little annoyed. It was the hour before dressing for dinner
  which she always devoted to repose&mdash;the hour saved from the stress of
  the day which had helped towards keeping her the young woman she certainly
  was. Yet Borrowdean&rsquo;s message was too urgent to ignore. She suffered
  her maid to wrap some sort of loose gown about her, and received him in her
  own study.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Sir Leslie,&rdquo; she said, a little reproachfully,
  &ldquo;was this really necessary? You know that after half-past six I am
  practically a person not existing&mdash;until dinner time!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should not have ventured to intrude upon you,&rdquo; Borrowdean
  said, quickly, &ldquo;if the circumstances had not been altogether
  exceptional. I know your habits too well. I have just come from
  Mannering.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From Mannering&mdash;yes!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Duchess,&rdquo; Borrowdean said, &ldquo;have you&mdash;forgive a
  blunt question&mdash;but have you any influence over him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice was silent for several moments.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You ask me rather a hard question,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A few
  months ago I think that I should have said yes. To- day&mdash;I am not sure.
  What has happened? Is anything wrong with him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, except that he seems to have gone mad,&rdquo; Borrowdean
  said, bitterly. &ldquo;I went to him to-day to get him to fix the dates for
  his meetings at Glasgow and Leeds. What do you think his answer
  was?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that he wants to back out!&rdquo; Berenice
  exclaimed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Almost as bad! He told me quite coolly that he was not prepared
  finally to set out his views upon the question until he had completed a
  course of personal investigation in some of the Northern centres of trade, to
  which he had committed himself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice looked bewildered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what on earth does he mean?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Surely
  he knows all that there is to be known. His mastery of statistics is
  something wonderful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What he means no man save himself can even surmise,&rdquo;
  Borrowdean answered. &ldquo;He told me that he had had information of a state
  of distress in some of our Northern towns&mdash;Newcastle and Hull he
  mentioned, and some of the Lancashire places&mdash;which had simply appalled
  him. He was determined to verify it personally, and to commit himself to
  nothing further until he had done so. And he even asked me if I could not
  find him a pair until the end of the session, so that he could get away at
  once. I was simply dumbfounded. A pair for Mannering!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice rose to her feet. She walked up and down the little room
  restlessly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir Leslie,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;I am not sure whether I
  have what you would call any influence over Mr. Mannering now or not. I might
  have had but for you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For me?&rdquo; Borrowdean exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. It was you who told me of&mdash;of&mdash;that woman,&rdquo;
  she said, haughtily, but with the colour rising almost to her temples.
  &ldquo;After that, of course things were different between us. We are
  scarcely upon such terms at present as would justify my
  interference.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean dropped his eyeglass, and swung it deliberately by its black
  ribbon. He looked steadily at Berenice, but his eyes seemed to travel past
  her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Duchess,&rdquo; he said, quietly, &ldquo;the game of life
  is a great one to play, and we who would keep our hands upon the board must
  of necessity make sacrifices. It is your duty to disregard in this instance
  your feelings towards Mannering. You must consider only his feelings towards
  you. They are such, I believe, as to give you a hold over him. You must make
  use of that hold for the sake of a great cause.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed! You seem to forget, Sir Leslie, that my share in this game,
  as you call it, must always be a passive one. I have no office to gain, no
  rewards to reap. Why should I commit myself to an unpleasant task for the
  sake of you and your friends?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is your party,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;Your party as much as
  ours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Granted,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Yet who are the responsible
  members of it? You know my opinion of Mannering as a politician. I would
  sooner follow him blindfold than all the others with my eyes open. Whatever
  he may lack, he is the most honest and right-seeing politician who ever
  entered the House.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He lacks but one thing,&rdquo; Borrowdean said, &ldquo;the
  mechanical adjustment of the born politician to party matters. There was
  never a time when absolute unity and absolute force were so necessary. If he
  is going to play the intelligent inquirer, if he falters for one moment in
  his wholesale condemnation of this scheme, he loses the day for himself and
  for us. The one thing which the political public never forgives is the man
  who stops to think.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo; Berenice asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To go to him and find out what he means, what influences have been
  at work, what is underneath it all. Warn him of the danger of even appearing
  doubtful, or for a moment lukewarm. The one person whom the public will not
  have in politics is the trifler. Think how many there have been, brilliant
  men, too, who have lost their places through a single false step, a single
  year, a month of dilettantism. Remind him of them. The man who moves in a
  great cause may move slowly, if you will, but he must move all the time.
  Remind him, too, that he is risking the one great chance of his
  life!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is to be Premier, then?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes! There is no alternative!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will go. I make no
  promises, mind. I will listen to what he has to say. I will put our view of
  the situation before him. But I make no promises. It is possible, even, that
  I shall come to his point of view, whatever it may be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no fear of that,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;but at least it
  would be something to know what this point of view is. You will find him in a
  queer mood. That little fool of a niece of his has been getting in with a
  fast set, and making the money fly. You have heard of her last escapade at
  Bristow?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I went there this morning directly I
  had your note. I feel rather self-reproachful about Clara Mannering. I meant
  to have looked after her more. She is rather an uninteresting young woman,
  though, and I am afraid I have let her drift away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She will be all right with a little looking after,&rdquo;
  Borrowdean said. &ldquo;Forgive me, but it is getting late.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will go at once,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>Afterwards she wondered often at that strange, uncertain fluttering of the
  heart, the rush and glow of feelings warmer than any which had lately stirred
  her, which seemed in those first few minutes of their being together, to make
  an altered woman of her. Mannering, as he entered the room, pale and
  listless, was conscious at once of a foreign element in it, something which
  stirred his somewhat slow-beating pulse, too, which seemed to bring back to
  him a flood of delicious memories, the perfume of his rose- gardens at
  evening, the soft night music of his wind-stirred cedars. She had thrown
  aside her opera cloak. The delicate lines of her bust seemed to have expanded
  with the unusual rise and fall of her bosom. A faint rose-tint flush of
  streaming colour had stained the ivory whiteness of her skin&mdash;her eyes
  as they sought his were soft, almost liquid. They met so seldom
  alone&mdash;and she was alone now with him in the room which was so
  characteristically his own, a room with many indications of his constant
  presence, which one by one she had been realizing with curiously quickened
  pulses during the few minutes of waiting. On her way here, driving in an open
  victoria, through the soft summer evening, she had seemed to be pursued
  everywhere by a new world of sensuous suggestions. Of the many carriages
  which she had passed, hers alone seemed to savour of loneliness. She was the
  only beautiful woman who sat alone and companionless. In a momentary block
  she had seen a man in a neighbouring hansom slip his hand, a strong, brown,
  well-looking hand, under the apron, to hold for a moment the fingers of the
  woman who sat by his side&mdash;Berenice had caught the answering smile, she
  had seen him lean forward and whisper something which had brought a deeper
  flush into her own cheeks and a look into her eyes, half amused, half tender.
  These were rare moments with her, these moments of sentiment&mdash;perhaps
  for that reason all the more dangerous. She forgot almost the cause of her
  coming. She remembered only that she was alone with the one man whose voice
  had the power to thrill her, whose touch would call up into life the great
  hidden forces of her own passionate nature. The memory of all other things
  passed away from her like a cloud gone from the face of the sun. She leaned
  towards him. His face was full of wonder&mdash;wonder, and the coming
  joy.</p><a id="pic5"
        name="pic5"></a>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1202051h-images/ALostLeader05.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration 5">
  </div><br>

  <p>&ldquo;Berenice!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>She let herself drift down the surging tide of this suddenly awakened
  passion. She held out her arms and pressed her lips on his as he caught
  her.</p>

  <p>Presently she pushed him gently away&mdash;held him there at arm&rsquo;s
  length.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is too absurd,&rdquo; she murmured, and drew him once more
  towards her with a choking little laugh. &ldquo;I came for something quite
  different!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What does it matter what you came for, so long as you stay,&rdquo;
  he answered. &ldquo;Say that you came to bring a glimpse of paradise to a
  lonely man!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She disengaged herself, and her long white fingers strayed mechanically to
  her tumbled hair. The elegant precision of her toilette had given place to a
  most distracting disarray. She felt her cheeks burning still, and the lace at
  her bosom was all crushed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I was on my way to a dinner party,&rdquo; she whispered, with
  humorously uplifted eyebrows. &ldquo;I must drive back home,
  and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And send an excuse,&rdquo; she declared, demurely. &ldquo;I am not
  equal to a family dinner party.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And afterwards?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you like,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;to take me out to
  dinner?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would I like!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go and change, and call for me in half an hour. We can go somewhere
  where we are not likely to be seen,&rdquo; she said, softly. &ldquo;I must
  cover myself up in my cloak. Whatever will Perkins say? Please remember that
  I have no hat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He held her hands and looked into her eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go for one moment,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;I want to
  realize it. I want to feel sure of you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The gravity of his manner was for a moment reflected in her tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you may feel sure. There are
  things which we may have to say to one
  another&mdash;presently&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stooped and kissed her fingers.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b206"
     name="ref-b206"></a>VI. &mdash; THE CONSCIENCE OF A STATESMAN</h2>

  <p>He was shown into her own little boudoir by a smiling maid- servant, who
  seemed already to treat him with an especial consideration. The wonder of
  this thing was still lying like a thrall upon him, and yet he knew that the
  joy of life was burning once more in his veins. He caught sight of himself in
  a mirror, and he was amazed. The careworn look had gone from his eyes, the
  sallowness from his complexion. His step was elastic, he felt the firm, quick
  beat of his heart, even his pulses seem to throb to a new and a wonderful
  tune. These moments whilst he waited for her were a joy to him. The
  atmosphere was fragrant with the perfume of her favourite roses, a book lay
  upon the little inlaid table face downwards as she had left it. There was a
  delicately engraved etching upon the wall, which he recognized as her work;
  the watercolours, all of a French school which he had often praised, were of
  her choosing. Perfect though the room was in colouring and detail, there was
  yet a habitable, almost a homely, air about it. Mannering moved about amidst
  her treasures like a man in a dream, only it was a dream of loneliness gone
  forever, of a grey life suddenly coloured and transformed. It was
  wonderful.</p>

  <p>Then the soft swish of a skirt, and she came in. She had changed her gown.
  She wore white lace, with a string of pearls about her neck. He looked
  eagerly into her face, and a great relief took the place of that single
  instant of haunting fear. The change was still there. It was not the great
  lady who swept in, but the woman who has found an answer to the one question
  of life, a little tremulous still, a little less self-assured. She looked at
  him almost appealingly. A delicate tinge of colour lingered in her cheeks. He
  moved quickly forward to meet her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>

  <p>He raised her hand to his lips. He was satisfied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You see what my new-born vanity has led to,&rdquo; she declared,
  smilingly. &ldquo;I have had to keep you waiting whilst I changed my gown. I
  hope you like me in white.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are adorable,&rdquo; he declared.</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;would you mind dining here alone
  with me? It will be quite a scratch meal, but I thought that it would be
  cosier than a restaurant, and afterwards&mdash;we could come in here and
  talk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should like it better than anything in the world,&rdquo; he
  declared, truthfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You may take me in, then,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hope that you
  are as hungry as I am. No, not that way. I have ordered dinner to be served
  in the little room where I dine when I am alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To Mannering there seemed something almost unreal about the chaste
  perfection of the meal and its wonderful service. They dined at a small round
  table, so small that more than once their fingers touched upon the
  tablecloth. A single servant waited upon them, swiftly and perfectly. The
  butler appeared only with the wine, which he served, and quietly withdrew.
  Across the tangled mass of flowers, only a few feet away all the time, sat
  the woman who had suddenly made the world so beautiful to him. A murmur of
  conversation continually flowed between them, but he was never very sure what
  they were talking about. He wanted to sit still, to feast his eyes, all his
  senses, upon her, to strive to realize this new thing, that from henceforth
  she was his! And then suddenly she broke the spell. She leaned back in her
  chair and laughed softly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have just remembered,&rdquo; she said, in response to his
  inquiring look, &ldquo;why I came to call upon you this evening. What a long
  time ago it seems.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I never thought to ask you,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We must have no secrets now,&rdquo; she said, with a delightful
  smile. &ldquo;Leslie Borrowdean came to see me this afternoon, and he was
  very anxious about you. He declared that you wanted to postpone your great
  meetings in the North until after you had made some independent
  investigations in some of the manufacturing centres. Poor Sir Leslie! You had
  frightened him so completely that he was scarcely coherent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering smiled a little gravely. It was like coming back to earth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Politics with Borrowdean are so much a matter of pounds, shillings
  and pence that the bare idea of his finding himself a day further away from
  office frightens him to death,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are all like the
  pawns, to be moved about the chessboard of his life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is certainly a very self-centred person,&rdquo; she remarked;
  &ldquo;but do you know, I am really a little curious to know how you
  succeeded in frightening him so thoroughly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had a fright myself,&rdquo; Mannering said. &ldquo;I was made to
  feel for an hour or so like a Rip van Winkle with the cobwebs hanging about
  me&mdash;Rip van Winkle looking out upon a new world!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You a Rip van Winkle!&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;What was it that
  man who wrote in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i> called you last week?
  &lsquo;The most precise and far-seeing of our politicians.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The men who write in reviews,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;sometimes
  display the most appalling ignorance. There was also some one in the
  <i>Saturday Review</i> who alluded to me last week as a library politician.
  My friend quoted that against me. &lsquo;A man who essays to govern a people
  he knows nothing of.&rsquo; It was one of the labour party who wrote it, I
  know, but it sticks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are not losing confidence in yourself, surely?&rdquo; she
  remarked, smiling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My views are unchanged, if that is what you mean,&rdquo; he
  answered. &ldquo;I believe I know what is good for the people, and when I am
  sure of it I shall not be afraid to take up the gauntlet. But I must be quite
  sure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You puzzle me a little,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;Has any one
  written more convincingly than you? Arguments which are founded upon logic
  and statistics must yield truth, and you have set it down in black and
  white.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the other hand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my unlearned but eloquent
  friend dismissed all statistics, all the science of argument and deduction,
  with the wave of a not too scrupulously clean hand. &lsquo;Figures,&rsquo; he
  said, &lsquo;are dead things. They are the playthings of the charlatan
  politician, who, by a sort of mental sleight of hand, can make them perform
  the most wonderful antics. If you desire the truth, seek it from live things.
  If you desire really to call yourself the champion of the people, come and
  see for yourself how they are faring. Figures will not feed them, nor
  statistics keep them from the great despair. Come and let me show you the
  sinews of the country, whether they are sound or rotten. You cannot see them
  through your library walls. It is only the echo of their voice which you hear
  so far off. If you would really be the people&rsquo;s man, come and learn
  something of the people from their own lips.&rsquo; This is what my friend
  said to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And who,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;was this prophet who came to you
  and talked like this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A retired bookmaker,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I will tell you of
  our meeting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She listened gravely. After he had finished there was a short silence. The
  dessert was on the table, and they were alone. Berenice was looking
  thoughtful.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he begged, &ldquo;exactly what that wrinkled
  forehead means?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was wondering,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;whether Sir Leslie was
  right, when he said that you had too much conscience ever to be a great
  politician.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It mirrors Borrowdean&rsquo;s outlook upon politics
  precisely,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

  <p>She smiled at him with a sudden radiance. She had risen to her feet, and
  with a quick, graceful movement leaned over him. This new womanliness which
  he had found so irresistible was alight once more in her face. Her eyes
  sought his fondly, she touched his lips with hers. The perfume of her
  clothes, the touch of her hair upon his cheek, were like a drug. He had no
  more words.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You may have one peach and one glass of the Prince&rsquo;s
  Burgundy, and then you must come and look for me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We
  have wasted too much time talking of other things. You haven&rsquo;t even
  told me yet what I have a right to hear, you know. I want to be told that you
  care for me better than anything else in the world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He caught her hands. There was a rare passion vibrating in his tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You do not doubt it, Berenice?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;but I want to be told. I
  am a middle-aged woman, you know, Lawrence, but I want to be made love to as
  though I were a silly girl! Isn&rsquo;t that foolish? But you must do
  it,&rdquo; she whispered, with her lips very close to his.</p>

  <p>He drew her into his arms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not at all sure,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I have enough
  courage to make love to a Duchess!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you can remember only that I am a woman,&rdquo; she whispered,
  &ldquo;very, very, very much a woman, and&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;a
  woman shockingly in love!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She disengaged herself suddenly, and was at the door before he could reach
  it. She looked back. Her cheeks were flushed. There was even a faint tinge of
  pink underneath the creamy white of her slender, stately neck.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dare,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to be more than five
  minutes!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering poured himself out a glass of wine, and sat quite still with his
  head between his hands. He wanted to realize this thing if he could. The
  grinding of the great wheels fell no more upon his ears. He looked into a new
  world, so different from the old that he was almost afraid.</p>

  <p>And in her room, Berenice waited for him impatiently.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b207"
     name="ref-b207"></a>VII. &mdash; A BLOW FOR BORROWDEAN</h2>

  <p>There was a somewhat unusual alertness in Borrowdean&rsquo;s manner as he
  passed out from the little house in Sloane Gardens and summoned a passing
  hansom. He drove to the corner of Hyde Park, and dismissing the cab strolled
  along the broad walk.</p>

  <p>The many acquaintances whom he passed and repassed he greeted with a
  certain amount of abstraction. All the time he kept his eyes upon the road.
  He was waiting to catch sight of some familiar liveries. When at last they
  came he contrived to stop the carriage and hastily threaded his way to the
  side of the barouche.</p>

  <p>Berenice was looking radiantly beautiful. The exquisite simplicity of her
  white muslin gown and large hat of black feathers, the slight flush with
  which she received him, as though she carried about with her a secret which
  she expected every one to read, the extinction of that air of listlessness
  which had robbed her for some time of a certain share of her good
  looks&mdash;of all these things Borrowdean made quick note. His face grew
  graver as he accepted her not very enthusiastic invitation and occupied the
  back seat of the carriage. For the first time he admitted to himself the
  possibility of failure in his carefully laid plans. He recognized the fact,
  that there were forces at work against which he had no weapon ready. He had
  believed that Berenice was attracted by Mannering&rsquo;s personality and
  genius. He had never seriously considered the question of her feelings
  becoming more deeply involved. So many men had paid vain court to her. She
  had a wonderful reputation for inaccessibility. And yet he remembered her
  manner when he had paid his first unexpected visit to Blakely. It should have
  been a lesson to him. How far had the mischief gone, he wondered!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So Mannering has gone North,&rdquo; he remarked, noticing that she
  avoided the subject.</p>

  <p>She nodded. Her parasol drooped a little his way, and he wondered whether
  it was because she desired her face hidden.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You saw him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;He explained how he felt to
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you could not dissuade him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did not try,&rdquo; she answered, simply. &ldquo;Lawrence
  Mannering is not a man of ordinary disposition, you know. He had come to the
  conclusion that it was right for him to go, and opposition would only have
  made him the more determined. I cannot see that there is any harm likely to
  come of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not so sure of that,&rdquo; Borrowdean answered, seriously.
  &ldquo;Mannering is <i>au fond</i> a man of sentiment. There is no clearer
  thinker or speaker when his judgment is unbiassed, but on the other hand, the
  man&rsquo;s nature is sensitive and complex. He has a sort of maudlin
  self-consciousness which is as dangerous a thing as the nonconformist
  conscience. Heaven knows into whose hands he may fall up there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is going incognito,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is not the sort of man to escape notice,&rdquo; Borrowdean
  answered. &ldquo;He will be discovered for certain. Of course, if it comes
  off all right, the whole thing will be a feather in his cap. But when I think
  how much we are dependent upon him, I don&rsquo;t like the risk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are sure,&rdquo; she remarked, thoughtfully, &ldquo;that you do
  not over-rate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mannering himself, perhaps,&rdquo; Borrowdean interrupted.
  &ldquo;There is no man whose personal place cannot be filled. But one thing
  is very certain. Mannering is the only man who unites both sides of our
  scattered party, the only man under whom Fergusson and Johns would both
  serve. You know quite well the curse which has rested upon us. We have become
  a party of units, and our whole effectiveness is destroyed. We want welding
  into one entity. A single session, a single year of office, and the thing
  would be done. We who do the mechanical work would see that there was no
  breaking away again. But we must have that year, we must have Mannering. That
  is why I watch him like a child, and I must say that he has given me a good
  deal of anxiety lately.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>Borrowdean hesitated. He seemed uncertain how to answer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I explain what I mean,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will
  understand that I do not speak to you as a woman and an acquaintance of
  Mannering&rsquo;s, but simply as one of ourselves. Mannering&rsquo;s private
  life is, of course, interesting to me only as an index to his political
  destiny, and my acquaintance with it arises solely from my political interest
  in him. There are things in connection with it which I feel that I shall
  never properly be able to understand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at him steadily. Her cheeks were a little whiter, but her tone
  was deliberate.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not wish to hear anything about Mr. Mannering&rsquo;s private
  life,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You will understand that I am not free or
  disposed to listen when I tell you that I am going to marry him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This was perhaps the worst blow Borrowdean had ever experienced in the
  course of his whole life. The possibility of this was a danger which he had
  recognized might some time have to be reckoned with, but for the present he
  had felt safe enough. He was taken so completely aback that for a few moments
  his mind was a blank. He remained silent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You do not offer me the conventional wishes,&rdquo; she remarked,
  presently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They go&mdash;from me to you&mdash;as a matter of course,&rdquo; he
  answered. &ldquo;To tell you the truth, I never thought of Mannering, for
  many reasons, as a marrying man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will have to readjust your views of him,&rdquo; she said,
  quietly, &ldquo;for I think that we shall be married very soon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean was a little white, and his teeth had come together. Whatever
  happened, he told himself, fiercely, this must never be. He felt his
  breast-pocket mechanically. Yes, the letter was there. Dare he risk it? She
  was a proud woman, she would be unforgiving if once she believed. But
  supposing she found him out? He temporized.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you for telling me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you mind
  putting me down here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why? You seemed in no hurry a few minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The world,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was a different place
  then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at him searchingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You had better tell me all about it,&rdquo; she remarked.
  &ldquo;You have something on your mind, something which you are half disposed
  to tell me, a little more than half, I think. Go on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked at her as one might look at the magician who has achieved the
  apparently impossible.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are wonderful,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes, I will tell you my
  dilemma, if you like. I have just come from Sloane Gardens!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her face changed instantly. It was as though a mask had been dropped over
  it. Her eyes were fixed, her features expressionless.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said, simply.</p>

  <p>He drew a letter from his pocket.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You may as well see it yourself,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;For
  reasons which you may doubtless understand, I have always kept on good terms
  with Mrs. Phillimore, and she was to have dined with me and some other
  friends to-morrow night. Here is a note which I had from her yesterday. Will
  you read it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice held it between her finger tips. There were only a few lines, and
  she read them at a glance.</p>

  <p class="letter">Sloane Gardens,<br>
  Tuesday.</p>

  <p class="letter">My dear Sir Leslie,</p>

  <p class="letter">I am so sorry, but I must scratch for to-morrow night. L.
  is going North on some mysterious expedition, and I am afraid that he will
  want me to go with him. In fact, he has already said so. Ask me again some
  time, won&rsquo;t you?</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours ever,<br>
  Blanche Phillimore</p>

  <p>Berenice folded up the letter and returned it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a little extraordinary,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;I am much
  obliged to you for showing me this. If you do not mind, we will talk of
  something else. Look, there is Clara Mannering alone under the trees. Go and
  talk to her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice touched the checkstring, and Borrowdean was forced to depart. She
  smiled upon him graciously enough, but she spoke not another word about
  Mannering. Borrowdean was obliged to leave her without knowing whether he had
  lost or gained the trick.</p>

  <p>Clara Mannering received him not altogether graciously. As a matter of
  fact, she was looking for some one else. They strolled along, talking almost
  in monosyllables. Borrowdean found time to notice the change which even these
  few months in London had wrought in her. She was still graceful in her
  movements, but a smart dressmaker had contrived to make her a perfect
  reproduction of the recognized type of the moment. She had lost her delicate
  colouring. There was a certain hardness in her young face, a certain pallor
  and listlessness in her movements which Borrowdean did not fail to note. He
  tried to lead the conversation into more personal channels.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We seem to have met very little during the last month,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;I have scarcely had an opportunity to ask you whether you find
  the life here as pleasant as you hoped, whether it has realized your
  expectations.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does anything ever do that?&rdquo; she asked, a little flippantly.
  &ldquo;It is different, of course. I do not think that I should be willing to
  go back to Blakely, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have made a great many friends,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I
  hear of you continually.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A host of acquaintances,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;I do not think
  that I have materially increased the circle of my friends. I hear of you too,
  Sir Leslie, very often. It seems that people give you a good deal of credit
  for inducing my uncle to come back into politics.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I certainly did my best to persuade him,&rdquo; Sir Leslie
  answered, smoothly. &ldquo;If I had known how much anxiety he was going to
  cause us I might perhaps have been a little less keen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anxiety!&rdquo; she repeated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes! Do you know where he is now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; Clara answered. &ldquo;All that I do know is
  that he has gone away for three weeks, and that I am going to stay with the
  Duchess till he comes back. It is very nice of her, and all that, of course,
  but I feel rather as though I were going into prison. The Duchess isn&rsquo;t
  exactly the modern sort of chaperon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean nodded sympathetically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And consider my anxiety,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Your uncle has
  gone North to consider the true position of the labouring classes. Now Mr.
  Mannering is a brilliant politician and a sound thinker, but he is also a man
  of sentiment. They will drug him with it up there. He will probably come back
  with half a dozen new schemes, and we don&rsquo;t want them, you know. He
  ought to be speaking at Glasgow and Leeds this week. He simply ignores his
  responsibilities. He yields to a sudden whim and leaves us <i>plantes
  la</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She seemed scarcely to have heard the conclusion of his sentence. Her
  attention was fixed upon a group of men who were talking near.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that Major Bristow?&rdquo; she asked
  Borrowdean, abruptly.</p>

  <p>Borrowdean put up his glass.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Looks like him,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should be so much obliged,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you would
  tell him that I wish to see him. I have a message for his sister,&rdquo; she
  concluded, a little lamely.</p>

  <p>Borrowdean did as he was asked. He noticed the slight impatience of the
  man as he delivered his message, and the flush with which she greeted him.
  Then, with a little shrug of the shoulders, he pursued his way.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b208"
     name="ref-b208"></a>VIII. &mdash; A PAGE FROM THE PAST</h2>

  <p>She swept into the room, humming a light opera tune, bringing with her the
  usual flood of perfumes, suggestion of cosmetics, a vivid apparition of the
  artificial. Her skirts rustled aggressively, her voice was just one degree
  too loud. Mannering rose to his feet a little wearily.</p>

  <p>She looked at him with raised eyebrows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What have you been doing with
  yourself, Lawrence? You look like a ghost!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am quite well,&rdquo; he answered, calmly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t look it,&rdquo; she answered, bluntly.
  &ldquo;Where have you been for the last few weeks?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Up in the North,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It was very hot, and I
  had a great deal to do. I suppose I am suffering, like the rest of us, from a
  little overwork.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She spread herself out in a chair opposite to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stand,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you fidget me. I have
  something to say to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So I gathered from your note,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t hurried.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I only got back to London last night,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I
  could scarcely come sooner, could I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; she admitted.</p>

  <p>Then for a moment or two she was silent. She was watching him a little
  curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is this true?&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;this rumour?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you be a little more explicit?&rdquo; he begged.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They say that you are going to marry the Duchess of
  Lenchester!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

  <p>She leaned forward. Her clasped hands rested upon her knee. She seemed to
  be examining the tip of her patent shoe. Suddenly she looked up at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You ought to have come and told me yourself!&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had no opportunity,&rdquo; he reminded her. &ldquo;I left London
  the morning after&mdash;it happened&mdash;and I returned last
  night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Political business?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Entirely.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lawrence,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Has mine been such a successful
  life, do you think, that you need grudge me a little happiness towards its
  close?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You are only forty-six. You are a
  young man still.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had forgotten my years,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I only know
  that I am tired.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You look it,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;I must say that there is
  very little of the triumphant suitor about you. You work too hard,
  Lawrence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I do,&rdquo; he asked, with a note of fierceness in his tone,
  &ldquo;whose fault is it? I was almost happy at Blakely. I had almost learned
  to forget. It was you who dragged me out again. You were not satisfied with
  half of my income; you were always in debt, always wanting more money. Then
  Borrowdean made use of you. He wanted me back into politics, you wanted more
  money for your follies and extravagances. Back I had to come into harness.
  Blanche, I&rsquo;ve tried to do my duty to you, but there is a limit. I owed
  you a comfortable place in life, and I have tried to see that you have it. I
  have never refused anything you have asked me, I have never mentioned the
  sacrifices which I have been forced to make. But there is a limit. I draw it
  here. I will not suffer any interference between the Duchess of Lenchester
  and myself!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blanche Phillimore rose slowly to her feet. He was used to her fits of
  passion, but there was no sign of anything of the sort in her face. She was
  agitated, but in some new way. Her words were an attack, but her manner
  suggested rather an appeal. Her large, fine eyes, her one perfectly natural
  feature, were soft and luminous. They seemed somehow to transfigure her face.
  To him it seemed like the foolish, handsome woman of fifteen years ago who
  had suddenly come to life again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You owed me&mdash;a comfortable place in life, Lawrence!
  Thank&mdash;you. You have paid the debt very well. You owed me&mdash;a
  respectable guardianship; you paid that, too. Thank you again. Now tell me,
  do you owe me nothing else?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I owed you one debt,&rdquo; he said, gravely, &ldquo;which neither
  I nor any other man who incurs it can ever discharge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am glad you realize it,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But have you
  ever tried to discharge it? You have given me a home and money to throw away
  on any folly which could kill thought. What about the rest?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blanche,&rdquo; he said, gravely, &ldquo;the rest was impossible!
  You know that as well as I do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is fifteen years ago, Lawrence,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and all
  that time we have fenced with our words. Now I am going to speak a little
  more plainly. You robbed me of my husband. The fault may not have been wholly
  yours, but the fact remains. You struck him, and he died. I was left
  alone!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering&rsquo;s face was ashen. The whole horrible scene was rising up
  again before him. He covered his face with his hands. It was more distinct
  than ever. He saw the man&rsquo;s flushed face, heard his stream of abuse,
  felt the sting of his blow, the hot anger with which he had struck back. Then
  those few awful moments of suspense, the moment afterwards when they had
  looked at one another. He shivered! Why had she let loose this flood of
  memories? She was speaking to him again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was left alone,&rdquo; she repeated, quietly, &ldquo;and I have
  been alone ever since. You don&rsquo;t know much about women, Lawrence. You
  never did! Try and realize, though, what that must mean to a woman like
  myself, not strong, not clever, with very few resources&mdash;just a woman. I
  cared for my husband, I suppose, in an average sort of way. At any rate he
  loved me. Then&mdash;there was you. Oh, you never made love to me, of course.
  You were not the sort of man to make love to another man&rsquo;s wife. But
  you used to show that you liked to be with me, Lawrence. Your voice and your
  eyes and your whole manner used to tell me that. Then there came&mdash;that
  hideous day! I lost you both. What have I had since, Lawrence?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very little, I am afraid, worth having.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very little&mdash;worth having&rsquo;!&rdquo; She flung the
  words from her with passionate scorn. &ldquo;I had your alms, your cold,
  hurried visits, when you seemed to shiver if our fingers touched. It would
  have seemed to you, I suppose, a terrible sin to have touched the lips of the
  woman whom you had helped to rob of her husband, to have spoken kindly to
  her, to have given her at least a little affection to warm her heart. Poor
  me! What a hell you made of my days, with your selfish model life, your
  panderings to conscience. I didn&rsquo;t want much, you know,
  Lawrence,&rdquo; she said, with a sudden choking in her voice. &ldquo;I would
  never have robbed you of your peace of mind. All I wanted was kindness. And I
  think, Lawrence, that it was a debt, but you never paid it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering had a moment of self-revelation, a terrible, lurid moment. Every
  word that she had said was true.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have never spoken to me like this before,&rdquo; he reminded
  her, desperately. &ldquo;I never knew that you cared.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie!&rdquo; she answered, calmly. &ldquo;You turned
  your head away that you might not see. In your heart you knew very well. What
  else, do you think, made me, a very ordinary, nervous sort of woman, get you
  out of the house that day, tell my story, the story that shielded you,
  without faltering, put even the words into your own mouth? It was because I
  was fool enough to care! And oh, my God, how you have tortured me since! You
  would sit there, coldly censorious, and reason with me about my friends, my
  manner of life. I knew what you thought. You didn&rsquo;t hide it very well.
  Lawrence, I wonder I didn&rsquo;t kill you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish that you had,&rdquo; he said, bitterly.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I know how you are feeling just now,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;Truth strikes home, you know, and it hurts just a little,
  doesn&rsquo;t it? In a few days your admirable common sense will prevail. You
  will say to yourself: &lsquo;She was that sort of woman, she had that sort of
  disposition, she was bound to go to the dogs, anyway!&rsquo; So you are going
  to marry the Duchess of Lenchester, Lawrence!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stood up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blanche,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that was all a mistake. I
  didn&rsquo;t understand. Let us forget that day altogether. Marry me now, and
  I will try to make up for these past years.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She stared at him blankly. The colour in her cheek was like a lurid patch
  under the pallor of her skin. She gave a little gasp, and her hand went to
  her side. Then she laughed hardly, almost offensively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a man of sentiment,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;After fifteen
  years, too, and only just engaged to another woman! No, thank you, my dear
  Lawrence. I&rsquo;ve lived my life, such as it has been. I&rsquo;m not so
  very old, but I look fifty, and I&rsquo;ve vices enough to blacken an entire
  neighbourhood. Fancy, if people saw me, and heard that you might have married
  the Duchess of Lenchester. They&rsquo;d hint at an asylum.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind about other people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Give me a
  chance, Blanche, to show that I&rsquo;m not such an absolute
  brute.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;Fifteen years ago I would
  have married you. In fact, I expected to. The reason why I found the courage
  to shield you from any unpleasantness that awful day was because I knew if
  trouble came and there was any scandal you would feel yourself obliged to
  marry me, and I wanted you to marry me&mdash;because you wanted to. What an
  idiot I was! Now, please go away, Lawrence. Marry the Duchess, if you like,
  but don&rsquo;t worry me with your re-awakened conscience. I&rsquo;m going my
  own way for the rest of my few years, and the less I see of you the better I
  shall be pleased. You will forgive me&mdash;but I have an
  engagement&mdash;down the river! I really must hurry you off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her teeth were set close together, the sobs seemed tangled in her throat.
  It seemed to her that all the longing in her life was concentrated in that
  one passionate desire, that he should seize her in his arms now, hold her
  there&mdash;tell her that it had all been a mistake, that the ugly times were
  dreams, that after all he had cared&mdash;a little! The room swam round with
  her, but she pointed smilingly to the door, which her trim parlour-maid was
  holding open. And Mannering went.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b209"
     name="ref-b209"></a>IX. &mdash; THE FALTERING OF MANNERING</h2>

  <p>Mannering left by the afternoon train for Hampshire, where he was to be
  the guest for a few days of the leader of his party. He arrived without
  sending word of his coming, to find the whole of the house party absent at a
  cricket match. The short respite was altogether welcome to him. He changed
  his clothes and wandered off into the gardens. Here an hour or so later
  Berenice&rsquo;s maid found him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Her Grace would like to see you, sir, if you would come to her
  sitting-room,&rdquo; the girl said, with a demure smile.</p>

  <p>Mannering, with something of an inward groan, followed her. Berenice, very
  slim and stately in her simple white muslin gown, rose from the couch as he
  entered, and held out her hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At last,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;You provoking man, to stay
  away so long. And what have you been doing with yourself?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her sentence concluded with a little note of dismay. Mannering was
  positively haggard in the clear afternoon light. There were lines underneath
  his eyes, and his face had a tense, drawn appearance. He did not kiss her, as
  she had more than half expected. He held her hands for a moment, and then
  sank down upon the couch by her side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was not exactly easy work&mdash;up there,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>She noticed the repression.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me all about it,&rdquo; she begged.</p>

  <p>His thoughts surged back to those three weeks of tragedy. His personal
  misery became for the moment a shadowy thing. The sorrows of one man, what
  were they to the breaking hearts of millions? He thought of the children, and
  he shuddered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so much to tell,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have been
  to a dozen or so of the largest towns in the North, and have taken the
  manufacturers one by one. I have taken their wage sheets and compared them
  with past years. The result was always the same. Less money distributed
  amongst more people. Afterwards we went amongst the people
  themselves&mdash;to see how they lived. It was like a chapter from the
  inferno&mdash;an epic of loathsome tragedy. I have seen the children,
  Berenice, and God help the next generation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must not forget, Lawrence,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that
  character is an essential factor in poverty. Poverty there must always be,
  because of the idle and shiftless.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Individual poverty, yes,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Not wholesale
  poverty, not streets of it, towns of it. I don&rsquo;t talk about starving
  people, although I saw them too. Our vicious charitable system may keep their
  cry from our ears, but my sympathies go out to the man who ought to be
  earning two pounds a week, and who is earning fifteen shillings; the man who
  used to have his bit of garden, and smoke, and Sunday clothes, and a day or
  so&rsquo;s holiday now and then. He was a contented, decent, God-fearing
  citizen, the backbone of the whole nation, and he has been blotted away from
  the face of the earth. They work now passively, like dumb brutes, to resist
  starvation, and human character isn&rsquo;t strong enough for such a strain.
  The public houses thrive, and the pawnshops are full. But the children
  haven&rsquo;t enough to eat. They are growing up lank, white, prematurely
  aged, the spectres to dance us statesmen down into hell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are overwrought, dear,&rdquo; she said, gently. &ldquo;You have
  been in the hands of a man whose object it was to show you only one side of
  all this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have sought for the truth,&rdquo; Mannering answered, &ldquo;and
  I have seen it. I have learned more in three weeks than all the Commissions
  and statistics and Board-of-Trade figures have taught me in five
  years.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she said, thoughtfully, &ldquo;you hesitated about
  that last Navy vote. Don&rsquo;t you see that the imperialism which you are a
  little disposed to shrug your shoulders at is the most logical and complete
  cure for all this? We must extend and maintain our colonies, and people them
  with our surplus population.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is not a policy which would ever appeal to me,&rdquo; he
  answered. &ldquo;It is like an external operation to remove a malady which is
  of internal origin. Either our social laws or our political systems are at
  fault when our trade leaves us, and our labouring classes are unable to earn
  a fair wage. That is the position we are in to-day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet, and walked restlessly up and down the room.
  Mannering had the look of a crushed man. She watched him critically. Writers
  in magazines and reviews had often made a study of his character. She
  remembered a brilliant contributor to a recent review, who had dwelt upon a
  certain lack of cohesion in his constitution, an inability to relegate
  sentiment to its proper place in dealing with the great workaday problems of
  the world. Conscientious, but never to be trusted, was the last anomalous but
  luminous criticism. Was this frame of mind of his a sign of it, she wondered?
  His place in politics was fixed and sure. What right had he, as a man of
  principle, with a great following, to run even the risk of being led away by
  false prophets? A certain hardness stole into her face as she watched him.
  She tried to steel herself against the sight of his suffering, and though she
  was not wholly successful, there was a distinct change in her tone and
  attitude towards him as she resumed her seat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;what this means from a practical
  point of view? How will it effect your plans?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must give up my public meetings,&rdquo; he answered, slowly.
  &ldquo;I have written to Manningham to tell him that he must get some one
  else to lead the campaign.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice was very pale. So many of these wonderful dreams of hers seemed
  vanishing into thin air.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is a terrible blow,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is the worst
  thing which has happened to us for years. Are you going over to the other
  side, Lawrence?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that altogether,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
  position is simply this: I am still, so far as my judgment and research go,
  opposed to tariff reform. On the other hand, I dare not take any leading part
  in fighting any scheme which has the barest chance of bringing better times
  to the working classes. I simply stand apart for the moment on this
  question.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laughed a little bitterly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is no other question,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You will never
  be allowed to remain neutral. You appear to me to be in a very singular
  position. You are divided between sentiment and conviction, and you prefer to
  yield to the former. Lawrence, do not be hasty! Think of all that depends
  upon your judgment in this matter. From the very first you have been the
  bitterest and most formidable opponent of this absurd scheme. If you turn
  round you will unsettle public opinion throughout the country. Remember, the
  power of the statesman is almost a sacred charge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am remembering,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;those children. I am
  bound to think this matter out, Berenice. I am going to meet Graham and
  Mellors next week. I shall not rest until I have made some effort to put my
  hand upon the weak spot. Somewhere there is a rotten place. I want to reach
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean to give up your seat?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not unless I am asked to,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I may need to
  work from there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose your mind is quite made up,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

  <p>Her maid came in just then, and Mannering offered to withdraw. She made no
  effort to detain him, and he went at once in search of his host and hostess.
  He found every one assembled in the hall below. Lord Redford, Borrowdean, and
  the chief whip of his party were talking together in a corner, and from their
  significant look at his approach, he felt sure that he himself had been the
  subject of their conversation. The situation was more than a little awkward.
  Lord Redford stepped forward and welcomed him cordially.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve been knocking yourself up,
  Mannering,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been proposing to Culthorpe
  here that we bar politics completely for twenty-four hours. We&rsquo;ll leave
  the dinner table with the ladies, and you and I will play golf to-morrow.
  I&rsquo;ve had Taylor down here, and I can assure you that my links are worth
  playing over now. Then on Thursday we&rsquo;ll have a conference.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was scarcely sure,&rdquo; Mannering said, with a slight smile,
  &ldquo;whether I should be expected to stay until then. Sir Leslie has told
  you of my telegrams?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Lord Redford said, quickly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
  postponed the meetings for the present. We&rsquo;ll talk that all out later
  on. You&rsquo;ve had some tea, I hope? No? Well, Eleanor, you are a nice
  hostess,&rdquo; he added, turning to his wife. &ldquo;Give Mr. Mannering some
  tea at once, and feed him up with hot cakes. Come into the billiard-room
  afterwards, Mannering, will you? I&rsquo;ve got a new table in the
  winter-garden, and we&rsquo;re going to have a pool before dinner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice came in and laid her hand upon her host&rsquo;s arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You need not worry about Mr. Mannering,&rdquo; she declared.
  &ldquo;He is going to have tea with me at that little table, and I am going
  to take him for a walk in the park afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So long as you feed him well,&rdquo; Lord Redford declared, with a
  little laugh, &ldquo;and turn up in good time for dinner, you may do what you
  like. If you take my advice, Berenice, you will join our league. We have
  pledged ourselves not to utter a word of shop for twenty-four
  hours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I submit willingly,&rdquo; Berenice answered. &ldquo;Mr. Mannering
  and I will find something else to talk about.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b210"
     name="ref-b210"></a>X. &mdash; THE END OF A DREAM</h2>

  <p>&ldquo;You can guess why I brought you here, perhaps,&rdquo; Berenice
  said, gently, as she motioned him to sit down by her side. &ldquo;This place,
  more than any other I know, certainly more than any other at Bayleigh, seems
  to me to be completely restful. There are the trees, you see, and the water,
  and the swans, that are certainly the laziest creatures I know. You look to
  me as though you needed rest, Lawrence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose I do,&rdquo; he answered, slowly. &ldquo;I am not sure,
  though, whether I deserve it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are rather a self-distrustful mortal,&rdquo; she remarked,
  leaning back in her corner and looking at him from under her parasol.
  &ldquo;You have worked hard all the session, and now you have finished up by
  three weeks of, I should think, herculean labour. If you do not deserve rest
  who does?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The rest which I deserve,&rdquo; Mannering answered, bitterly,
  &ldquo;is the rest of those whose bones are bleaching amongst the caves and
  corals of the sea there! That is Matapan Point, isn&rsquo;t it, where the
  hidden rocks are?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really, you are developing into a very gloomy person,&rdquo; she
  said. &ldquo;Lawrence, don&rsquo;t let us fence with one another any longer.
  What you may decide to do politically may be ruinous to your career, to your
  chance of usefulness in the world, and to my hopes. But I want you to
  understand this. It can make no difference to me. I have had dreams perhaps
  of a great future, of being the wife of a Prime Minister who would lead his
  country into a new era of prosperity, who would put the last rivets into the
  bonds of a great imperial empire. But one never realizes all one&rsquo;s
  hopes, Lawrence. I love politics. I love being behind the scenes, and helping
  to move the pawns across the board. But I am a woman, too, Lawrence, and I
  love you. Put everything connected with your public life on one side. Let me
  ask you this. You are changed. Has anything come between us as man and
  woman?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;something has come between
  us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She sat quite still for several minutes. She prayed that he too might keep
  silence, and he seemed to know her thoughts. Over the little sheet of
  ornamental water, down the glade of beech and elm trees narrowing towards the
  cliffs, her eyes travelled seawards. It was to her a terrible moment.
  Mannering had represented so much to her, and her standard was a high one. If
  there was a man living whom she would have reckoned above the weaknesses of
  the herd, it was he. In those days at Blakely she had almost idealized him.
  The simple purity of his life there, his delicate and carefully chosen
  pleasures, combined with his almost passionate love of the open places of the
  earth, had led her to regard him as something different from any other man
  whom she had ever known. All Borrowdean&rsquo;s hints and open statements had
  gone for very little. She had listened and retained her trust. And now she
  had a horrible fear. Something had gone out of the man, something which went
  for strength, something without which he seemed to lack that splendid
  militant vitality which had always seemed to her so admirable. Perhaps he was
  going to make a confession, one of those crude, clumsy confessions of a
  stained life, which have drawn the colour and the joy from so many beautiful
  dreams. She shivered a little, but she inclined her head to listen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have asked another woman to marry me only a few hours ago,&rdquo;
  he said, quietly.</p>

  <p>Berenice was a proud woman, and for the moment she felt her love for this
  man a dried-up and shrivelled thing. She was white to the lips, but she
  commanded her voice, and her eyes met his coldly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I inquire into the circumstances&mdash;of this&mdash;somewhat
  remarkable proceeding?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is a woman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whose life I helped to
  wreck&mdash;not in the orthodox way,&rdquo; he added, with a note of scorn in
  his tone, &ldquo;but none the less effectually. The one recompense I never
  thought of offering her was marriage. I have seen that, despite all my
  efforts to aid her, her life has been a failure. Her friends have been the
  wrong sort of friends, her life the wrong sort of life. What it was that was
  dragging her downwards I never guessed, for she, too, in her way, was a proud
  woman. To-day she sent for me. What passed between us is her secret as much
  as mine. I can only tell you that before I left I had asked her to marry
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said, calmly, &ldquo;that you need tell me no
  more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is very little more that I can tell you,&rdquo; he answered.
  &ldquo;I have no affection for her, and she has refused to marry me. But she
  remains&mdash;between us&mdash;irrevocably!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are lucidity itself,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Will you
  forgive me if I leave you? I am scarcely used to this sort of situation, and
  I should like to be alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go by all means, Berenice,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You and I are
  better apart. But there is one thing which I must say to you, and you must
  hear. What has passed between you and me is the epitome of the love-making of
  my life. You are the only woman whom I have desired to make my wife. You are
  the only woman whom I have loved, and shall love until I die. I can make you
  no reparation, none is possible! Yet these things are my
  justification.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice had turned away. The passionate ring of truth in his tone
  arrested her footsteps. She paused. Her heart was beating very fast, her
  coldness was all assumed. It was so much happiness to throw away, if indeed
  there was a chance. She turned and faced him, nervous, gaunt, hollow- eyed,
  the wreck of his former self. Pity triumphed in spite of herself. What was
  this leaven of weakness in the man, she wondered, which had so suddenly
  broken him down? He had only to hold on his way and he would be Prime
  Minister in a year. And at the moment of trial he had crumpled up like a
  piece of false metal. A wave of false sentiment, a maniacal
  hyper-conscientiousness, had been sufficient to sap the very strength from
  his bones. And then&mdash;there was this other woman. Was she to let him go
  without an effort? He might recover his sanity. It was perhaps a mere nervous
  breakdown, which had made him the prey of strange fancies. She spoke to him
  differently. She spoke once more as the woman who loved him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lawrence,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are telling me too much, and
  not enough. If you want to send me away I must go. But tell me this first.
  What claim has this woman upon you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is not my secret,&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;I cannot tell
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Leslie Borrowdean knows it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I could have
  heard it, but I refused to listen. Remember, whatever you may owe to other
  people you owe me something, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Well, listen. I killed her
  husband!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You! You&mdash;killed her husband!&rdquo; she repeated vaguely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes! She shielded me. There was an inquest, and they found that he
  had heart disease. No one knew that I had even seen him that day, no one save
  she and a servant, who is dead. But the truth lives. He had reason to be
  angry with me&mdash;over a money affair. He came home furious, and found me
  alone with his wife. He called me&mdash;well, it was a lie&mdash;and he
  struck me. I threw him on one side&mdash;and he fell. When we picked him up
  he was dead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was terrible!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but you should have braved
  it out. They could have done very little to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But I was young, and my
  career was just beginning. The thing stunned me. She insisted upon secrecy.
  It would reflect upon her, she thought, if the truth came out, so I
  acquiesced, I left the house unseen. All these days I have had to carry the
  burden of this thing with me. To-day&mdash;seemed to be the climax. For the
  first time I understood.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She can never marry you,&rdquo; Berenice said. &ldquo;It would be
  horrible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She refused to marry me to-day,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but she
  laid her life bare, and I cannot marry any one else.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice was trembling. She was no longer ashamed to show her
  agitation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am very sorry for you, Lawrence,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am
  very sorry for myself. Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She left him, and Mannering sank back upon the seat.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b211"
     name="ref-b211"></a>XI. &mdash; BORROWDEAN SHOWS HIS
     &ldquo;HAND&rdquo;</h2>

  <p>&ldquo;To be plain with you,&rdquo; Borrowdean remarked,
  &ldquo;Mannering&rsquo;s defection would be irremediable. He alone unites
  Redford, myself, and&mdash;well, to put it crudely, let us say the
  Imperialistic Liberal Party with Manningham and the old-fashioned Whigs who
  prefer the ruts. There is no other leader possible. Redford and I talked till
  daylight this morning. Now, can nothing be done with Mannering?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To be plain with you, too, then, Sir Leslie,&rdquo; Berenice
  answered, &ldquo;I do not think that anything can be done with him. In his
  present frame of mind I should say that he is better left alone. He has
  worked himself up into a thoroughly sentimental and nervous state. For the
  moment he has lost his sense of balance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Desperate necessity,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;sometimes justifies
  desperate measures. We need Mannering, the country and our cause need him. If
  argument will not prevail there is one last alternative left to us. It may
  not be such an alternative as we should choose, but beggars must not be
  choosers. I think that you will know what I mean.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; Berenice answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are aware,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that there is in
  Mannering&rsquo;s past history an episode, the publication of which would
  entail somewhat serious consequences to him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was a most eloquent monosyllable, but Borrowdean had gone too far to
  retreat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I propose that we make use of it,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;Mannering&rsquo;s attitude is rankly foolish, or I would not suggest
  such a thing. But I hold that we are entitled, under the circumstances, to
  make use of any means whatever to bring him to his senses.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice smiled. They were standing together upon a small hillock in the
  park, watching the golf.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Charlatanism in politics does not appeal to me,&rdquo; she said,
  drily. &ldquo;Any party that adopted such means would completely alienate my
  sympathies. No, my dear Sir Leslie, don&rsquo;t stoop to such low-down means.
  Mannering is honest, but infatuated. Win him back by fair means, if you can,
  but don&rsquo;t attempt anything of the sort you are suggesting. I, too, know
  his history, from his own lips. Any one who tried to use it against him,
  would forfeit my friendship!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Success then would be bought too dearly,&rdquo; Borrowdean
  answered, with a gallantry which it cost him a good deal to assume.
  &ldquo;May I pass on, Duchess, in connexion with this matter, to ask you a
  somewhat more personal question?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Berenice said, calmly, &ldquo;that I can spare you
  the necessity. You were going to speak, I believe, of the engagement between
  Lawrence Mannering and myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; Borrowdean admitted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It does not exist any longer,&rdquo; Berenice said, &ldquo;I should
  be glad if you would inform any one who has heard the rumour that it is
  without any foundation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean looked thoughtfully at the woman by his side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am very glad to hear it,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I am glad for
  many reasons, and I am glad personally.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed! I cannot imagine how it should affect you
  personally.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I perhaps said more than I meant to,&rdquo; he replied, calmly.
  &ldquo;I am a poor, struggling politician myself, whose capital consists of
  brains and a capacity for work, and whose hopes are coloured with perhaps too
  daring ambitions. Amongst them&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Mannering has holed out from off the green,&rdquo; she
  interrupted. &ldquo;Positively immoral, I call it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amongst them,&rdquo; Borrowdean continued, calmly, &ldquo;is one
  which some day or other I must tell you, for indeed you are concerned in
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can assure you, Sir Leslie,&rdquo; she said, looking at him
  steadily, &ldquo;that I am not at all a sympathetic person. My strong advice
  to you would be&mdash;not to tell me. I do not think that you would gain
  anything by it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean met his fate with a bow and a shrug of the shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It only remains,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for me to beg you to pardon
  what might seem like presumption. Shall we meet them on the last
  green?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering would have avoided Berenice, but she gave him no option. She
  laid her hand upon his arm, and volunteered to show him a new way home.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must be on your guard, Lawrence,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Lord
  Redford is very fond of concealing his plans to the last moment, but he is a
  very clever man. And Sir Leslie Borrowdean would give his little finger to
  catch you tripping. All this avoidance of politics is part of a scheme. They
  will spring something upon you quite suddenly. Don&rsquo;t give any hasty
  pledges.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you for your warning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will be
  careful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as a friend, what are your plans?
  Forget that I am interested in politics altogether. I simply want to know how
  you are spending your time for the next few months.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It depends upon them,&rdquo; he answered, looking downwards into
  the valley, where Lord Redford and Borrowdean were walking side by side.
  &ldquo;If they ask me to resign my seat I shall go North again, and it is
  just possible that I might come back into the House as a labour member. On
  the other hand, if they are content with such support as I can give them, and
  to have me on the fence at present so far as the tariff question is
  concerned, why, I shall go back and do the best I can for them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are not quite won over to the other side yet, then,&rdquo; she
  remarked, smiling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;If ever there was an honest
  doubter, I am one. If I had never left my study, England could not have
  contained a more rabid opponent of any change in our fiscal policy than I. I
  am like a small boy who is absolutely sure that he has worked out his sum
  correctly, but finds the answer is not the one which his examiner expects.
  There is something wrong somewhere. I want, if I can, to discover it. I only
  want the truth! I don&rsquo;t see why it should be so hard to find, why
  figures and common sense should clash entirely and horribly with existing
  facts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You wore dun-coloured spectacles when you took your walks
  abroad,&rdquo; she said, smiling. &ldquo;No one else seems to have discovered
  so distressing a state of affairs as you have spoken of.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because they never looked beneath the surface,&rdquo; he answered.
  &ldquo;I myself might have failed to understand if I had not been shown.
  Remember that our workingman of the better class does not go marching through
  the streets with an unemployed banner and a tin cup when he is in want. He
  takes his half wages and closes the door upon his sufferings. God help
  him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Adieu, politics,&rdquo; she declared, with a shrug of the
  shoulders. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that Clara playing croquet with Major Bristow?
  I wish I didn&rsquo;t dislike that man so much. I hate to see the child with
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering sighed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor Clara!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am afraid I have left her a
  good deal to herself lately.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid you have,&rdquo; she agreed, a little gravely.
  &ldquo;May I give you a word of advice?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know that I should be grateful for it,&rdquo; he declared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be sure that she never goes to the Bristows again, and ask her
  whether she has any other card debts. It may be my fancy, but I don&rsquo;t
  like the way that man hangs about her, and looks at her. I am sure that she
  does not like him, and yet she never seems to have the courage to snub
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am very much obliged to you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will speak
  to her to-day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where I am going, or what I shall do for the
  autumn,&rdquo; she continued, with a little sigh, &ldquo;but if you like to
  trust Clara with me I will look after her. I think that she needs a woman.
  Yes, I thought so. Redford and Sir Leslie are waiting for you. Go and have it
  out with them, my friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are too kind to me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;kinder than I
  deserve!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I am afraid
  that my kindness is only another form of selfishness. I am rather a lonely
  person, you know. Lord Redford is beckoning to you. I am going to break up
  that croquet party.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering joined the other two men. Berenice strolled on to the lawn.
  Major Bristow eyed her coming with some disfavour. He was one of the men whom
  she always ignored. Clara, on the other hand, seemed proportionately
  relieved.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want you to come to my room as soon as you possibly can,
  child,&rdquo; Berenice said. &ldquo;Shall I wait while you finish your
  game?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I will come at once,&rdquo; Clara exclaimed, laying down her
  mallet. &ldquo;Major Bristow will not mind, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Major Bristow looked as though he did mind very much, but lacked the nerve
  to say so. Berenice calmly took Clara by the arm and led her away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are not engaged to Major Bristow by any chance, are you?&rdquo;
  she asked, calmly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Engaged to Major Bristow? Heavens, no!&rdquo; Clara answered.
  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he is in the least a marrying man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So much the better for our sex,&rdquo; Berenice answered. &ldquo;I
  wouldn&rsquo;t spend so much time with him, my dear, if I were you. I have
  known people with nicer reputations.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Clara turned a shade paler.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can never get away from him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He follows
  me&mdash;everywhere, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You do not by any chance, I suppose, owe him money?&rdquo; Berenice
  asked. &ldquo;They tell me that he has a somewhat objectionable habit of
  winning money from girls, more than they can afford to pay, and then
  suggesting that it stand over for a time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Clara turned towards her with terrified eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I do owe Major Bristow a little still,&rdquo; she admitted.
  &ldquo;I seem to have been so unlucky. He told me that any time would do,
  that I should win it back again, and I had no idea what stakes we were
  playing. I don&rsquo;t touch a card now at all, but this was at Ellingham
  House. They insisted on my making a fourth at bridge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice tightened her grasp upon the girl&rsquo;s arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything about this to your uncle just now,&rdquo;
  she insisted. &ldquo;I am going to take you up to my room and write you a
  cheque for the amount, whatever it may be. Afterwards I will have a talk with
  Major Bristow. Nonsense, child, don&rsquo;t cry! The money is nothing to me,
  and I always promised your uncle that I would look after you a
  little.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have been such a fool!&rdquo; the girl sobbed.</p>

  <p>Berenice for a moment was also sad. Her lips quivered, her eyes were
  wistful.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We all think that sometimes, child,&rdquo; she said, quietly.
  &ldquo;We all have our foolish moments and our hours of repentance, even the
  wisest of us!&rdquo;</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b212"
     name="ref-b212"></a>XII. &mdash; SIR LESLIE BORROWDEAN INCURS A HEAVY
     DEBT</h2>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; Lord Redford remarked, thoughtfully,
  &ldquo;politics represents a different thing to all of us, according to our
  temperament. To me, I must confess, it is a plain, practical business, the
  business of law-making. To you, Mannering, I fancy that it appeals a little
  differently. Now, let us understand one another. Are you prepared to
  undertake this campaign which we planned out a few months ago?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I did undertake it,&rdquo; Mannering said, &ldquo;it would be to
  leave unsaid the things which you would naturally expect from me, and to say
  things of which you could not possibly approve. I am very sorry. You can
  command my resignation at any moment, if you will. But my views, though in
  the main they have not changed, are very much modified.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lord Redford nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is our misfortune, but it certainly is
  not your fault. As for your resignation, if you crossed the floor of the
  House to-morrow we should not require it of you. You are responsible to your
  constituents only. We dragged you back into public life&mdash;you see I admit
  it freely&mdash;and we are willing to take our risk. Whether you are with us
  or against us, we recognize you as one of those whose place is amongst the
  rulers of the people.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are very generous, Lord Redford,&rdquo; Mannering answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not at all. It is no use being peevish. You are a great
  disappointment to us, but we have not given up hope. If you are not
  altogether with us to-day, there is to-morrow. I tell you frankly, Mannering,
  that I look upon you as a man temporarily led astray by a wave of
  sentimentality. So long as the world lasts there will be rich men and poor,
  but you must always remember in considering this that it is character as well
  as circumstances which is at the root of the acquisition of wealth.
  Generations have gone to the formation of our social fabric. It is the slow
  evolution of the human laws of necessity. The socialist and the
  sentimentalist and the philanthropist, dropping gold through his fingers,
  have each had their fling at it, but their cry is like the cry from the
  wilderness&mdash;a long, lone thing! And then to come to the real point,
  Mannering. Grant for a moment all that you have told Borrowdean and myself
  about the condition of the labour classes in the great towns and the
  universal depression of trade. How can you possibly imagine that the
  imposition of tariff duties is the sovereign, or even a possible, remedy?
  Why, you yourself have been one of the most brilliant pamphleteers against
  anything of the sort. You have been called the Cobden of the day. You cannot
  throw principles away like an old garment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us leave for one moment,&rdquo; Mannering answered, &ldquo;the
  personal side of the matter. I have seen in the majority of our large cities
  terrible and convincing proof of the decline of our manufacturing industries.
  I have seen the outcome of this in hundreds of ruined homes, in a whole
  generation coming into the world half starved, half clothed&mdash;God help
  those children. I have always maintained that the labouring classes should be
  the happiest race of people in this country. I find them without leisure or
  recreation, fighting fate with both hands for food. Redford, the whole world
  has never shown us a greater tragedy than the one which we others
  deliberately and persistently close our eyes to&mdash;I mean the struggle for
  life which is being waged in every one of our great cities.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have statistics,&rdquo; Borrowdean began.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Damn statistics!&rdquo; Mannering interrupted. &ldquo;I have
  juggled with figures myself in the old days, and I know how easy it is. So do
  you, and so does Redford. This is what I want to put to you. The tragedy is
  there. Perhaps those who have faced it and come back again to tell of their
  experiences have been a little hysterical&mdash;the horror of it has carried
  them away. They may not have adopted the most effectual means of making the
  world understand, but it is there. I have seen it. A thousandth part of this
  misery in a country with which we had nothing to do, and no business to
  interfere, and we should be having mass meetings at Exeter Hall, and making
  general asses of ourselves all over the country, shrieking for intervention,
  wasting a whole dictionary of rhetoric, and probably getting well snubbed for
  our pains. And because the murders are by slow poison instead of with steel,
  because they are in our own cities and amongst our own people, we accept them
  with a sort of placid satisfaction. You, Lord Redford, speak of character and
  enunciate social laws, and Borrowdean will argue that after all the trade of
  the country is not so bad as it might be, and will make an epigram on the
  importation of sentimentality into politics. In plain words, Lord Redford,
  we, as a party, are asleep to what is going on. One statesman has recognized
  it, and proposed a startling and drastic remedy. We attack the remedy tooth
  and nail, but we place forward no counter proposition. It is as though a
  dying man were attended by two doctors, one of whom has prepared a remedy
  which the other declines to administer without suggesting one of his own. It
  is not a logical position. The medicine may not cure, but let the man have
  his chance of life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your simile,&rdquo; Lord Redford said, &ldquo;assumes that the man
  is dying.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have seen the mark of death upon his face,&rdquo; Mannering
  answered. &ldquo;The men who are traitors to their country to-day are those
  who, healthy enough themselves, talk causeless and shallow optimism which is
  fed alone by their own prosperity. The doctrine of Christ is the care of
  others. If you do not believe, the sick-room is open also to you; go there
  unprejudiced, and with an open mind, and you will come away as I have come
  away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Must we take it, then, Mannering,&rdquo; Lord Redford said,
  gravely, &ldquo;that you are prepared to support the administering of the
  medicine you spoke of?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering was silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am not going to be amongst those
  who cry out against it and offer nothing themselves. I am going to analyze
  that medicine, and if I see a chance of life in it I shall say, let us run a
  little risk, rather than stand by inactive, to look upon the face of death.
  In other words, I become for the moment a passive figure in politics so far
  as this question is concerned.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lord Redford held out his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let it go at that, Mannering,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I believe that
  you will come back to us. We shall be always glad of your support, but of
  course you will understand that the position from to-day is changed. If you
  had carried the standard, as we had hoped, the reward also was to have been
  yours. We must elect one of ourselves to take your place. To put it plainly,
  your defection now releases us from all pledges.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Mannering answered. &ldquo;It was scarcely
  ambition which brought me back into politics, and I must work for the cause
  in which I believe. If I am forced to take any definite action, I shall, of
  course, resign my seat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The door closed behind him. Borrowdean struck a match, and Lord Redford
  looked thoughtfully out of the window across the park.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was always afraid of this,&rdquo; Borrowdean said, gloomily.
  &ldquo;There is a leaven of madness in the man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lord Redford shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Genius or madness,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;We may yet see him a
  modern Rienzi carried into power on the shoulders of the people. Such a man
  might become anything. As a matter of fact, I think that he will go back into
  his study. He has the brain to fashion wonderful thoughts, and the lips to
  fire them into life. But I doubt his adaptability. I cannot imagine him ever
  becoming a real and effective force.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean, who was bitterly disappointed, smoked furiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If Mannering is not for us, I
  think that I can at least promise that he does no harm on the other
  side.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lord Redford turned away from the window. He eyed Borrowdean
  curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was you,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;who brought Mannering back
  into public life. You had a certain reward for it, and you would have had a
  much greater one if things had gone our way. But I want you to remember this.
  Mannering is best left alone&mdash;now, for the present. You understand
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean shrugged his shoulders. There was a good deal too much
  sentiment in politics.</p>

  <p>Mannering and Berenice came together for a few moments on the terrace
  after dinner. He was not so completely engrossed in his own affairs as to
  fail to notice her lack of colour and a certain weariness of manner, which
  had kept her more silent than usual during the whole evening.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is nothing definite,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You see, the
  question of tariff reform is not before the House at present, and Redford
  does not require me to resign my seat. But of course it will come to that
  sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She leaned over the grey balustrade. With her it was a moment of weakness.
  She was suddenly conscious of the fact that she was no longer a young woman.
  The time when she might hope to find in life the actual flavour and joy of
  passionate living was nearing the end. And a little while ago they had seemed
  so near! The pity of it stirred up a certain sense of rebellion in her heart.
  She was still a beautiful woman. She knew very well the arts by which men are
  enslaved. Why should she not try them upon him&mdash;this man who loved her,
  who seemed willing to sacrifice both their lives to a piece of senseless
  quixoticism? Her fingers touched his, and held them softly. Thrilled through
  all his senses, he turned towards her wonderingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are we wise, Lawrence,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;if indeed you
  love me? Life is so short, and I am not a young woman any more. I have been
  lonely so long. I want a little happiness before I go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he cried, hoarsely. &ldquo;You know&mdash;what
  comes between us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was a little indignant, but still tender.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This woman does not want you, Lawrence,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I
  do! Oh, Lawrence!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He faltered. She laid her fingers upon his arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come down the steps,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;and I will show
  you Lady Redford&rsquo;s rose-garden.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her touch was compelling. He could not have resisted it. And about his
  heart lay the joy of her near presence. Side by side they moved along the
  terrace&mdash;it seemed to him that they passed towards their destiny. The
  gentle rustling of her clothes, their slight, mysterious perfume, was like
  music to him. A sudden wave of passion carried him away. The primitive
  virility of the man, awake at last, demanded its birthright.</p>

  <p>And then upon the lower step they met Borrowdean, and he placed himself
  squarely in their way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry to interrupt you,&rdquo; he said, gravely, &ldquo;but
  Lord Redford has sent me out to look for you and to send you at once into the
  library. Something rather serious has happened.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering came down to earth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The evening papers have come,&rdquo; Borrowdean said. &ldquo;The
  <i>Pall Mall</i> has the whole story. You were seen at the
  working-men&rsquo;s club in Glasgow!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering turned towards the house. His nerves were all tingling with
  excitement, but the thread had suddenly been snapped. He was no longer in
  danger of yielding to that flood of delicious sensations. His voice had been
  almost steady as he had begged Berenice to excuse him. Berenice stood quite
  still. Her hand was pressed to her side, her dark eyes were lit with passion.
  She leaned forward towards Borrowdean, and seemed about to strike him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will find yourself&mdash;repaid for this, Sir Leslie,&rdquo;
  she murmured.</p><a id="pic6"
        name="pic6"></a>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration 6">
  </div><br>

  <p>Then she turned abruptly away. For an hour or more she walked alone
  amongst the trellised walks of Lady Redford&rsquo;s rose-garden. But
  Mannering did not return.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b213"
     name="ref-b213"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE WOMAN AND&mdash;THE OTHER WOMAN</h2>

  <p>&ldquo;You see, Mannering,&rdquo; Lord Redford said, tapping the outspread
  evening paper with his forefinger, &ldquo;the situation now presents a
  different aspect. I have no wish to force your hand&mdash;a few hours ago I
  think I proved this. But if you are to remain even nominally with us some
  sort of pronouncement must come from you in reply to these
  statements.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mannering said, &ldquo;that is quite
  reasonable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The postponement of your campaign has been hinted at before,&rdquo;
  Lord Redford continued, &ldquo;but we have never used the word abandonment.
  Now, to speak bluntly, the whole fat is in the fire. Your place on the fence
  is no longer possible. You must make your own declaration, and it must be for
  one of three things. You must remain with us, abandon public life for a time,
  or go over to the other side. And you must make promptly an announcement of
  your intentions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no alternative in the matter,&rdquo; Mannering said.
  &ldquo;In fact, I think that this has happened opportunely. My presence with
  you was sure to prove something of an embarrassment to all of us. I shall
  apply for the Chiltern Hundreds to-morrow, and I shall not seek to re- enter
  the present Parliament. The few months&rsquo; respite will be useful to me. I
  can only express to you, Lord Redford, my sincere gratitude for all your
  consideration, and my regret for this disarrangement of your
  plans.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lord Redford sighed. Why were men born, he wondered, with such a
  prodigious capacity for playing the fool?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My chief regret, Mannering,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is for you. The
  Fates so controlled circumstances that you seemed certain to achieve as a
  young man what is the crowning triumph of us veterans in the political world.
  I respect the honest scruples of every man, but it seems to me that you are
  throwing away an unparalleled opportunity in a fit of what a practical man
  like myself can only call sentimentality. I have no more to say. Forgive me
  if I have said too much. For the rest, give us the pleasure of your company
  here for as long as you find it convenient. We will abjure politics, and you
  shall give me my revenge at golf.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am very much obliged to you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but there is
  only one course open to me. I must go back and make my plans. If I could have
  a carriage for the nine-forty!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lord Redford made no effort to induce him to change his mind, though he
  remained courteous to the last.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was really glad to have him go,&rdquo; he told Borrowdean
  afterwards. &ldquo;His very presence&mdash;the thought that there could be
  such colossal fools in the world&mdash;irritated me beyond measure. You can
  write his epitaph, Leslie, if your humorous vein is working, for the man is
  politically dead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One never knows,&rdquo; Berenice said, quietly. &ldquo;There must
  be something great about a man capable of such prodigious self-sacrifice. For
  at heart Lawrence Mannering is an ambitious man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lord Redford shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I am very sure of this. There
  is nothing so great about the man as his folly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Personally, I believe that
  Sir Leslie would find his epitaph a little previous. I saw a great deal of
  Lawrence Mannering in the country, and I think that I understand him as well
  as either of you. I believe that his day will come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, all I can say is,&rdquo; Lord Redford pronounced, &ldquo;that
  I very much wish you had left him down at his country home. Between you you
  have created a very serious situation. I must go up to town to-morrow and see
  Manningham. In the meantime, Leslie, I shall leave those reports severely
  alone. We must ignore Mannering altogether.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice turned away with a smile at her lips. She had a very little
  opinion of Lord Redford and his following. Already she saw the man whose
  career they counted finished, at the head of a new and greater party. There
  were plenty of clever men of the coming generation, plenty of room for
  compromises, for the formation of a great national party out of the scattered
  units of a disunited opposition. She believed Mannering strong enough to do
  this. She saw in it greater possibilities than might have been forthcoming
  even if he had been chosen to lead the somewhat ragged party represented by
  Lord Redford and his followers. For the rest, she had been very near the
  success she so desired. Only an accident had robbed her of victory. If once
  they had reached the rose- garden she knew that she would have triumphed.</p>

  <p>As her maid took off her jewellery that night she smiled at herself in the
  glass. She was thinking of that moment on the terrace. The glow had not
  wholly faded from her face&mdash;she saw herself with her long, slender neck
  and smooth, unwrinkled complexion, still beautiful, still a woman to be
  loved. Her maid ventured to whisper a word of respectful compliment. Truly
  Madame La Duchesse was growing younger!</p>

  <p>What strange whim, or evil fate, had turned his feet in that direction?
  Mannering often tried to trace backwards the workings of his mind that night,
  but he never wholly succeeded. He reached London about eleven, and sent his
  man home with his luggage, intending merely to call in at the club for
  letters. But afterwards he remembered only that he had strolled aimlessly
  along homewards, thinking deeply, and not particularly careful as to his
  direction. Even then he would have passed the house in Sloane Gardens without
  looking up, but for the civil &ldquo;Good-night, sir,&rdquo; of a coachman
  sitting on the box of a small brougham drawn up against the kerb. He raised
  his head to return the salute, and realized at once where he was. Almost at
  the same moment the front door opened, and behind a glow of light in the hall
  he saw a familiar figure in the act of passing out to her carriage. The
  street was well lit, and he was almost opposite a lamp-post. She recognized
  him at once.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lawrence,&rdquo; she exclaimed, incredulously.
  &ldquo;You&mdash;were you coming in?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was wrapped from head to foot in a long white opera cloak, but the
  jewels in her hair and at her throat glistened in the flashing light. She
  moved slowly forward to his side. Her maid, who had been coming out to open
  the carriage door, lingered behind.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;upon my word, I scarcely know how I came here,&rdquo; he
  answered, a little bewildered. &ldquo;I was walking home&mdash;it is scarcely
  out of my way&mdash;and thinking. You are going out?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded. Looking at her now more closely he saw the shadows under her
  eyes, only imperfectly concealed. The little gesture with which she answered
  him savoured of weariness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I was going out. I have sat alone with my thoughts all day,
  and I don&rsquo;t want to end my life in a lunatic asylum. I want a little
  change, that is all. If you will come in and talk to me instead, that will do
  as well. Any sort of distraction, you see,&rdquo; she added, with a hard
  little laugh, &ldquo;just to keep me from&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She did not finish her sentence. He looked at her gravely, and from her to
  the waiting carriage. He suddenly realized how the altered condition of
  affairs must affect her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall have to come and see you in a day or two,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;But now&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not now, then?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have an engagement,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was only going somewhere to supper. I was going to call for Eva
  Fanesborough, and I suppose we should have had some bridge afterwards. Come
  in instead, Lawrence. I can telephone to her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Already a presage of evil seemed to be forming itself in his mind. He
  would have given anything to have thought of some valid excuse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your carriage&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;John, I shall not want you
  to-night,&rdquo; she said to the coachman. &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She led the way, and Mannering followed. As the maid closed the door
  behind them Mannering felt his breath quicken&mdash;his sense of depression
  grew stronger. He seemed threatened by some new and intangible danger. He
  stood on the hearthrug while she bent over the switch and turned on the
  electric light in the sitting-room. Then she threw off her cloak and looked
  at him curiously for a moment. Her face softened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Lawrence,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;has politics done this,
  or are you ill?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am quite well,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;A little tired,
  perhaps. I have had rather a trying day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She rang the bell, and ordered sandwiches and wine.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You look like a corpse,&rdquo; she said, and stood over him while
  he ate and drank. And all the time that indefinable fear within him grew. She
  made him smoke. Then she leaned back in an easy-chair and looked across at
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You had something to say to me. What was it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing good,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I have quarrelled with my
  party, and I have to resign my seat in the House.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Already?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Already! I am sorry, as of course in a few months&rsquo; time I
  should have been in office, and drawing a considerable salary. As it
  is&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I understand!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t
  matter much. I only have the house for six months furnished, and that&rsquo;s
  paid for in advance. John must go, and the horses can be sold.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked at her in amazement. Only a few months ago she had talked very
  differently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I am not sure whether all that will be necessary,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;I can find a tenant for Blakely, and I daresay I can manage
  another hundred a year or so. Only, of course, the large increase we had
  thought of will not be possible now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not,&rdquo; she answered, idly.</p>

  <p>He moved in his chair uncomfortably. He found her wholly
  incomprehensible.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a beast I must have seemed to you always,&rdquo; she
  exclaimed, suddenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked, pointlessly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sponged on you all my life, and you&rsquo;re not a rich
  man, are you, Lawrence? Then I dragged you into politics to supply me with
  the means to spend more money. My claim on you was one of sentiment only,
  but&mdash;I&rsquo;ve made you pay. No wonder you hate me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your claim on me, even to every penny I possess,&rdquo; Mannering
  answered, &ldquo;was a perfectly just one. I have never denied it, and I have
  done my best. And as to hating you, you know quite well it is not
  true!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; She rose suddenly to her feet, and before he had
  realized her intention she was on her knees by his side. She caught at his
  hand and kept her face hidden from him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lawrence,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I was mad the other day. It was
  all the pent-up bitterness of years which seemed to escape me so suddenly. I
  said so much that I did not mean to&mdash;I was mad, dear. Oh, Lawrence, I am
  so lonely!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then the fear in his heart became a live thing. He was dumb. He could not
  have spoken had he tried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was your coldness all these years,&rdquo; she murmured.
  &ldquo;You were different once. You know that. At first, when the horror of
  what happened was young, I thought I understood. I thought, as it wore off,
  that you would be different. The horror has gone now, Lawrence. We know that
  it was an accident, it might as well have been another as you. But you have
  not changed. I have given up hoping. I have tried everything else, and I am a
  very miserable woman. Now I am going to pray to you, Lawrence. You do not
  care for me more. Pretend that you do! You cannot give me your love. Give me
  the best you can. Don&rsquo;t despise me too utterly, Lawrence! Pity me, if
  you will. Heaven knows I need it. And&mdash;you will be a little
  kind!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her hands were clasped about his neck. He disengaged himself gently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blanche!&rdquo; he cried, hoarsely, &ldquo;I love another
  woman!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you engaged to her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No! Not now!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then what does it matter? What does it matter, anyhow? It is not
  the real thing I am asking you for, Lawrence&mdash;only the make-belief! Keep
  the rest for her, if you must, but give me lies, false looks, hollow
  caresses, anything! You see what depths I have fallen to.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He held her hands tightly. A great pity for her filled his
  heart&mdash;pity for her, and for himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blanche,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is one way only. It is for
  you to decide. Will you marry me? I will do my best to make you a good
  husband!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Marry you?&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Lawrence, I dare
  not!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot alter the past,&rdquo; he said, sadly. &ldquo;It never
  seemed to me possible that you could care for my&mdash;after what happened.
  But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it is not that,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;There
  is&mdash;the other woman, and, Lawrence, I should be afraid. I am not good
  enough!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whatever you are, Blanche,&rdquo; he said, gravely, &ldquo;remember
  that it is I who am responsible for your having been left alone to face the
  world. Your follies belong to me. I am quite free to share their burden with
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But the other woman?&rdquo; she faltered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must love her always,&rdquo; he said, quietly, &ldquo;but I
  cannot marry her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you would kiss me sometimes, Lawrence?&rdquo; she
  whispered.</p>

  <p>He took her quietly into his arms and kissed her forehead.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will do my best, Blanche,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I dare not
  promise any more.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a id="ref-b301"
     name="ref-b301"></a>BOOK III</h2>

  <h2>I. &mdash; MATRIMONY AND AN AWKWARD MEETING</h2>

  <p>&ldquo;How delightfully Continental!&rdquo; Blanche exclaimed, as the
  head-waiter showed them to their table. &ldquo;Hester, did you ever see
  anything more quaint?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is perfect,&rdquo; the girl answered, leaning back in her chair,
  and looking around with quiet content.</p>

  <p>Mannering took up the menu and ordered dinner. Then he lit a cigarette and
  looked around.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It certainly is quaint,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One dines out of
  doors often enough, especially over here, but I have never seen a courtyard
  made such excellent use of before. The place is really old, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They had found their way to a small seaside resort, in the north of
  France, which Mannering had heard highly praised by some casual acquaintance.
  The courtyard of the small hotel was set out with round dining tables, and
  the illumination was afforded by Japanese lanterns hung from every available
  spot. A small band played from a wooden balcony. Monsieur, the proprietor,
  walked anxiously from table to table, all smiles and bows. Through the roofed
  way, which led from the street, one caught a distant glimpse of the sea.</p>

  <p>Mannering, to the surprise of his friends, and to his own secret
  amazement, had survived the crisis which had seemed at one time likely enough
  to wreck his life. Politically he was no longer a great power, for the party
  whose cause he had half espoused had met with a distinct reverse, and he
  himself was without a seat in Parliament, but amongst the masses his was
  still a name to conjure with. Socially his marriage with Blanche Phillimore
  had scarcely proved the disaster which every one had anticipated. Her old
  ways and manner of life lay in the background. She had aged a little,
  perhaps, and grown thinner, but she had shown from the first an almost
  pathetic desire to adapt her life to his, to assume an altogether unobtrusive
  position, and if she could not in any way influence his destiny, at least she
  did not hamper it. She had made no demands upon him which he was not able to
  grant. She had lived where he had suggested, she had never embarrassed him
  with too vehement an affection. As for Mannering himself, he had found solace
  in work. Defeated at the polls, he had declined a safe seat, and remained the
  chosen independent candidate of a great Northern constituency. He addressed
  public meetings occasionally, and he contributed to the reviews. Without
  having ever finally committed himself to a definite scheme of tariff reform,
  he preached everywhere the doctrine of consideration. In a modified way he
  was reckoned now as one of its possible supporters.</p>

  <p>They were almost halfway through their dinner when some commotion was
  heard in the narrow street outside. Then with much tooting of horns and the
  shrill shouting of directions from the bystanders, two heavily laden touring
  cars turned slowly into the cobbled courtyard, and drew up within a few feet
  of the semicircular line of tables. Mannering&rsquo;s little party watched
  the arrivals with an interest shared by every one in the place. Muffled up in
  cloaks and veils, they were at first unrecognized. It was Mannering himself
  who first realized who they were.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Clara!&rdquo; he exclaimed to the young lady who was standing
  almost by his side. &ldquo;Welcome to Bonestre!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She turned towards him with a little start.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Uncle!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;How extraordinary! Why, how
  long have you been here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We arrived this afternoon,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You remember
  Hester, don&rsquo;t you? And this is Mrs. Mannering.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Clara shook hands with both. She declared afterwards that she was
  surprised into it, but she would certainly never have recognized in the
  quiet, rather weary-looking, woman who sat at her uncle&rsquo;s side the
  Blanche Phillimore whom she had more than once passionately declared that she
  would sooner die than speak to. She murmured a few mechanical words, and
  then, suddenly realizing the situation, she glanced a little anxiously over
  her shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know who I am with, uncle?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

  <p>But Mannering was already face to face with Berenice. She held out her
  hand without hesitation. If she felt any emotion she concealed it perfectly.
  Her voice was steady and cordial, if her cheeks were pale. The dust lay
  thickly upon them all. Mannering, tall and grave in his plain dinner clothes
  and black tie, stood almost like a statue before her, until her extended hand
  invited his movement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What an extraordinary meeting,&rdquo; she said, quietly. &ldquo;I
  am very glad to see you again, Mr. Mannering. We have had such a ride, all
  the way from Havre along roads an inch thick in dust. This is your wife, is
  it not? I am very glad to know you, Mrs. Mannering.&rdquo;</p><br>

  </div><br>

  <p>All that might have been embarrassing in the encounter seemed dissolved by
  the utterly conventional tone of her greeting. Sir Leslie Borrowdean came up
  and joined them, and Lord and Lady Redford. Then the little party, escorted
  by the landlord, disappeared into the hotel. Mannering resumed his seat and
  continued his dinner. He leaned over and addressed his wife. His tone was
  kinder than usual.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When we have had our coffee,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I hope that you
  will feel like a walk. The moon is coming up over the sea.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take Hester,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She loves that sort of thing.
  I have a headache, and I should like to go upstairs as soon as
  possible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So Hester walked with Mannering out to the rocks where pools of water,
  left by the tide, shone like silver in the moonlight. They talked very little
  at first, but as they leaned over the rail and looked out seawards Hester
  broke the silence, and spoke of the things which they both had in their
  minds.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry they came,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am afraid it will
  upset mother, and it is not pleasant for you, is it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For me it is nothing, Hester,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and I hope
  that your mother will not worry about it. They all behaved very nicely, and
  we need not see much of them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She passed her arm through his.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me how you feel about it,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;It must
  seem to you like a glimpse of the life you left when&mdash;when
  you&mdash;married!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hester,&rdquo; he said, earnestly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make any
  mistake about this. Don&rsquo;t let your mother make any mistake. It was my
  political change of views which separated me from all my former
  friends&mdash;that entirely. To them I am an apostate, and a very bad sort of
  one. I deserted them just when they needed me. I did it from convictions
  which are stronger to-day than ever. But none the less I threw them over. I
  always said that they very much exaggerated my importance as a factor in the
  situation, and my words are proved. They carried the elections without any
  difficulty, and they have formed a strong Government. They can afford to be
  magnanimous to me. If I had stayed with them I should have been in office. As
  it was, I lost even my seat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You did what you thought was right,&rdquo; she said, softly.
  &ldquo;No one can do any more!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering thought over her words as they walked homewards over the
  sand-dunes. Yes, he had done that! Was he satisfied with the result? He had
  become a minor power in politics. Men spoke of him as a weakling&mdash;as one
  who had shrunk from the burden of great responsibility, and left the friends
  who had trusted him in the lurch. And then&mdash;there was the other thing.
  He had paid a great price for this woman&rsquo;s salvation. Had he succeeded?
  She had given up all her old ways. She dressed, she lived, she carried
  herself through life even with a furtive, almost a pathetic, attempt to reach
  his standard. Often he caught her watching him as though fearful lest some
  word or action of hers had been displeasing to him. And yet&mdash;he
  wondered&mdash;was this what she had hoped for? Had he given her what she had
  the right to expect? Had he indeed received value for the price he had paid?
  He asked Hester a sudden question:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hester, is your mother happy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hester started a little.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If she is not,&rdquo; she answered, gravely, &ldquo;she must be a
  very ungrateful woman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He left it at that, and together they retraced their steps to the hotel.
  Hester slipped up to her room by a side entrance, but Mannering was obliged
  to pass the table where the new arrivals were lingering over their coffee.
  Clara and Lord Redford both called to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come and have a smoke with us, Mannering, and tell us all about
  this place,&rdquo; the latter said. &ldquo;The Duchess and your niece are
  charmed with it, and they want to stay for a few days. Are there any golf
  links?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come and sit next me, uncle,&rdquo; Clara cried, &ldquo;and tell me
  how you like being guardian to an heiress. How I have blessed that dear
  departed aunt of mine every day of my life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering accepted a cigarette, and sat down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The golf links are excellent,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As for your
  aunt, Clara, she was a very sensible woman. Her money was so well invested
  that I have practically nothing to do. I expect my duties will commence when
  the young men come!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Mannering,&rdquo; Sir Leslie said, gravely, &ldquo;is not at
  all attracted by young men. She prefers something more staid. I have serious
  hopes that before our little tour is over I shall have persuaded her to marry
  me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You dear man!&rdquo; Clara exclaimed. &ldquo;I only wish
  you&rsquo;d give me the chance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a brazen child to have to chaperon,&rdquo; the
  Duchess said. &ldquo;Positively asking for a proposal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And not in vain,&rdquo; Sir Leslie declared. &ldquo;Walk down to
  the sea with me, Miss Clara, and I&rsquo;ll propose to you in my most
  approved fashion. I think you said that the investments were sound,
  Mannering?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The investments are all right,&rdquo; Mannering answered,
  &ldquo;but I shall have nothing to do with fortune-hunters.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I a Cabinet Minister!&rdquo; Sir Leslie declared. &ldquo;Miss
  Clara, let us have that walk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow night,&rdquo; she promised. &ldquo;When I get up it will
  be to go to bed. Even your love-making, Sir Leslie, could not keep me awake
  to- night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Duchess rose. The dust was gone, but she was pale, and looked
  tired.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us leave these men to make plans for us,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;I hope we shall see something of you to-morrow, Mr. Mannering.
  Good-night, everybody.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering rose and bowed with the others. For a moment their eyes met. Not
  a muscle of her face changed, and yet Mannering was conscious of a sudden
  wave of emotion. He understood that she had not forgotten!</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b302"
     name="ref-b302"></a>II. &mdash; THE SNUB FOR BORROWDEAN</h2>

  <p>Berenice sat at one of the small round tables in the courtyard, finishing
  her morning coffee. Sir Leslie sat upon the steps by her side. It was one of
  those brilliant mornings in early September, when the sunlight seems to find
  its way everywhere. Even here, surrounded by the pile of worn grey stone
  buildings, which threw shadows everywhere, it had penetrated. A long shaft of
  soft, warm light stretched across the cobbles to their feet. Berenice, slim
  and elegant, fresh as the morning itself, glanced up at her companion with a
  smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Clara,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;does not like to be kept
  waiting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is not down yet,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and there is
  something I want to say to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her delicate eyebrows were a trifle uplifted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you think that you had better?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am a man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and things are known to me which
  a woman would scarcely discover. Do you think that it is quite fair to send
  Lady Redford out motoring with Mrs. Mannering?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lady Redford is, of course, ignorant of Mrs. Mannering&rsquo;s
  antecedents. What you may do yourself concerns no one. You make your own
  social laws, and you have a right to. But I do not think that even you have a
  right to pass Blanche Phillimore on to your friends, even under the shelter
  of Mannering&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice looked at him for several seconds without speaking. Borrowdean
  bit his lip.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If we were not acquaintances of long standing, Sir Leslie,&rdquo;
  she said, calmly, &ldquo;I should consider your remarks impertinent. As it
  is, I choose to look upon them as a regrettable mistake. The person, whoever
  she may be, whom the Duchess of Lenchester chooses to receive is usually
  acceptable to her friends. I beg that you will not refer to the subject
  again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir Leslie bowed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no more to say,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Knowing naturally
  a good deal more than you concerning the lady in question, I considered it my
  duty to say what I have said.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is the sort of duty,&rdquo; Berenice murmured, &ldquo;which the
  whole world seems to accept always with a relish. One does not expect it so
  much from your sex. Mrs. Mannering was born one of us, and she has had an
  unhappy life. If she has been indiscreet she has her excuses. I choose to
  whitewash her. Do you understand? I pay dearly enough for my social position,
  and I certainly claim its privileges. I recognize Mrs. Mannering, and I
  require my friends to do so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir Leslie rose up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are, if you will forgive my saying so,&rdquo; he remarked,
  drily, &ldquo;more generous than wise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;is my affair. Here comes Clara.
  Before you start, find Mr. Mannering. He is in the hotel somewhere writing
  letters, and tell him that when he has finished I wish to speak to
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir Leslie only bowed. He felt himself opposed by a will as strong as his
  own, and he was too seriously annoyed to trust himself to speech. Clara, in
  her cool white linen dress, came strolling up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What have you been doing to Sir Leslie?&rdquo; she asked, laughing.
  &ldquo;He has just gone into the hotel with a face like a
  thunder-cloud.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have been giving him a lesson in Christian charity,&rdquo;
  Berenice answered. &ldquo;He needs it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Clara nodded. She understood.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think you are awfully kind,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>Berenice smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hate all narrowness,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and if there is a
  man on God&rsquo;s earth who deserves to have people kind to him it is your
  uncle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir Leslie returned, and he and Clara departed for the golf links.
  Berenice was left alone in the little grey courtyard, fragrant with the
  perfume of scented shrubs and blossoming plants, filled too, with the warm
  sunlight, which seemed to find its way into every corner. She sat at her
  little table, paler than a few moments ago, her teeth clenched, her white
  fingers clasped together. Underneath her muslin blouse her heart had suddenly
  commenced to beat fiercely&mdash;a sense of excitement, long absent, was
  stealing through her veins. The bonds which a year&rsquo;s studied
  self-repression had forged were snapped apart. She knew now what it meant,
  the great inexpressible thing, the one eternal emotion which has come
  throbbing down the world from the days when poets sung their first song and
  painters flung truth on to canvas. She was a woman like the others, and she
  loved. Her unique position in society, her carefully studied life, her lofty
  ambitions, were like vain things crumbling into dust before her eyes. A year
  of cold misery seemed atoned for by the simple fact that within a few yards
  of her he sat writing&mdash;that within a few minutes he would be by her
  side. Of the future she scarcely thought. Hers was the woman&rsquo;s love,
  content with small things. Its passion was of the soul, and its song was
  self-sacrifice. But if she had known&mdash;if she had only known!</p>

  <p>He came out to her soon. His manner was quiet and a little grave.
  Self-control came easier to him because the truth had been with him longer.
  Nevertheless, he was not wholly at his ease.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know what has happened?&rdquo; she asked, smiling. &ldquo;The
  Redfords have taken Mrs. Mannering and her daughter motoring, and Sir Leslie
  and Clara have gone to the golf links. You and I are left to entertain one
  another.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What would you like to do?&rdquo; he asked, simply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should like to walk,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;down by the sea
  somewhere. I am ready now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They made their way through the little town, along the promenade and on to
  the sands beyond. Then a climb, and they found themselves in a thick wood
  stretching back inland from the sea. She pointed to a fallen trunk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us sit down,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There are so many things I
  want to ask you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On the way they had spoken only of indifferent matters, yet from the first
  Mannering had felt the presence of a subtle something in her deportment
  towards him, for which he could find no explanation. He himself was feeling
  the tension of this meeting. He had expected to find her so different.
  Gracious, perhaps, because she was a great lady, but certainly without any of
  these suggestions of something kept back, which continually, without any sort
  of direct expression, made themselves felt. And when they sat down she said
  nothing. He had the feeling that it was because she dared not trust herself
  to speak. Surprise and agitation kept him, too, silent.</p>

  <p>At last she spoke. Her voice was not very steady, and she avoided looking
  at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should like,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to have you tell me about
  yourself&mdash;about your life&mdash;and your work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is told in a few words,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Somewhere,
  somehow, I have failed! I could not adopt the Birmingham programme, I could
  not oppose it. You know what isolation means politically?&mdash;abuse from
  one side and contempt from the other. That is what I am experiencing. The
  working classes have some faith in me, I believe. My work, such as it is, is
  solely for them. I suppose the papers tell the truth when they say that mine
  is a ruined career&mdash;only, you see, I am trying to do the best I can with
  the pieces.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, softly, &ldquo;that is something. To do the
  best one can with the pieces. We all might try to do that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You, at least, have no need to consider such a thing,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;So far as any woman can be preeminent in politics you have
  succeeded in becoming so. I saw that a lady&rsquo;s paper a few weeks ago
  said that your influence outside the Cabinet was more powerful than any one
  man&rsquo;s within it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, calmly, &ldquo;the papers talk like that. It
  gives their readers something to laugh at! I wonder what you would say, my
  friend, if I told you that I, too, am engaged in that same thankless task. I,
  too, am striving to do the best I can with the pieces.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are not serious!&rdquo; he protested.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am very serious indeed,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Shall I tell
  you more? Shall I tell you when I made my mistake?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he cried, hoarsely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I shall,&rdquo; she continued, suddenly gripping his arm.
  &ldquo;I meant to tell you. I brought you here to tell you. I made my mistake
  when I let Leslie Borrowdean take you back to Lord Redford just as we were
  entering the rose-garden at Bayleigh. Do you remember? I made my mistake when
  I suffered anything in this great world to come between me and a
  woman&rsquo;s only chance of happiness! I made my mistake when I was too
  proud to tell you that I loved you, and that nothing else in the world
  mattered. There! You tried me hard! You know that! But my mistake was none
  the less fatal. I ought to have held fast by you, and I let you go. And I
  shall suffer for it all my days.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You cared like that?&rdquo; he cried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Worse!&rdquo; she answered, turning her flushed face towards him.
  &ldquo;I care now. Kiss me, Lawrence!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He held her in his arms. Time stood still until she stole away with an odd
  little laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have vindicated myself. No one can
  ever call me a proud woman again. And you know the truth! I might have had
  you all to myself and I let you go. Now I am going to do the best I can with
  the pieces. The half of you I want belongs to your wife. I must be content
  with the other half. I suppose I may have that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But your friends&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bosh! My friends and your wife must make the best of it. I
  shan&rsquo;t rob her again as I did just now. You can blot that
  out&mdash;antedate it. It belonged to the past. But I am not going through
  life as I have gone through this last year, longing for a sight of you,
  longing to hear you speak, and denying myself just because you are married.
  Live with your wife, Lawrence, and make her as happy as you can, but remember
  that you owe me a great deal, too, and you must do your best to pay it.
  Don&rsquo;t look at me as though I were talking nonsense.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He held her hand. She placed it in his unresistingly. All the lines in his
  face seemed smoothed out. The fire of youth was in his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you wonder that I am surprised?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;All this
  year you have made no sign. All the time I have been schooling myself to
  forget you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dare to tell me that you have succeeded!&rdquo; she
  exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not an iota!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It was the most miserable
  failure of my life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She smiled upon him delightfully, and gently withdrew her hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lawrence,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am going to talk to you
  seriously for one minute. You are too conscientious for a politician.
  Don&rsquo;t let the same vice spoil our friendship! Certain things you owe to
  your wife. Mind, I admit that, though from some points of view even that
  might be disputed. But you also owe me certain things&mdash;and I mean to be
  paid. I won&rsquo;t be avoided, mind. I want to be treated as a very
  close&mdash;and dear&mdash;companion&mdash;and&mdash;kiss me once more,
  Lawrence, and then we&rsquo;ll begin,&rdquo; she wound up, with a little sob
  in her throat.</p>

  <p>An hour later the whole party had <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> together in the
  courtyard of the little hotel. The Duchess was noticeably kind to Mrs.
  Mannering, and she snubbed Sir Leslie. Clara looked on a little gravely. The
  situation contained many elements of interest.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b303"
     name="ref-b303"></a>III. &mdash; CLOUDS&mdash;AND A CALL TO ARMS</h2>

  <p>The first cloud appeared towards the end of the third day at Bonestre.
  Blanche and Sir Leslie were left alone, and he hastened to improve the
  opportunity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Duchess and your husband,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;appear
  very easily to have picked up again the threads of their old
  friendship.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Duchess,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;is a very charming woman.
  I am sure that you find her so, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are very old friends,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but I was never
  admitted to exactly the same privileges as your husband enjoys.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Duchess,&rdquo; she answered, calmly, &ldquo;is a woman of
  taste!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir Leslie muttered something under his breath. Blanche made a movement as
  though to take up again the book which she had been reading in a sheltered
  corner of the hotel garden.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that we should make
  better friends than enemies?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not at all sure,&rdquo; she answered, calmly. &ldquo;To tell
  you the truth, I don&rsquo;t fancy you particularly in either
  capacity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laughed unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are scarcely complimentary,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did not mean to be,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Why should
  I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are content, then, to let your husband drift back into his old
  relations with the Duchess? I presume that you know what they
  were?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whether I am or not,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;what business is
  it of yours?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will tell you, if you like,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;In fact, I
  think it would be better. It has been the one desire of my life to marry the
  Duchess of Lenchester myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She smiled at him scornfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;let me give you a little advice. Give
  up the idea. They say that lookers-on see most of the game, and so far as I
  am concerned I&rsquo;m certainly the looker-on of this party. The Duchess
  doesn&rsquo;t care a row of pins about you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are other marriages, besides marriages of affection,&rdquo;
  Sir Leslie said, stiffly. &ldquo;The Duchess is ambitious.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But she is also a woman,&rdquo; Blanche declared. &ldquo;And she is
  in love.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With whom?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With my husband! I presume that is clear enough to most
  people!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir Leslie was a little staggered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You take it very coolly,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not? The Duchess is too proud a woman to give herself away, and
  my husband&mdash;belongs to me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t any idea of taking poison, or anything of that
  sort, I suppose, have you?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;The other woman nearly
  always does that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not in real life,&rdquo; Blanche answered, composedly.
  &ldquo;Besides, I&rsquo;m not the other woman&mdash;I&rsquo;m the one. The
  Duchess is the other!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But your husband&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know, I should prefer not to discuss my husband&mdash;with
  you,&rdquo; Blanche said, calmly, taking up her book. &ldquo;He is not the
  sort of man you would be at all likely to understand. If you want a rich wife
  why don&rsquo;t you propose to Clara Mannering? I suppose you knew that some
  unheard-of aunt had left her fifty thousand pounds?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir Leslie rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fancy that you and I are very sympathetic this
  afternoon,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I will go and see if any one has
  returned.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I shall miss you, of course, but my
  book is positively absorbing, and I am dying to go on with it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir Leslie left the garden without another word. Blanche held her book
  before her face until he had disappeared. Then it slipped from her fingers.
  She looked hard into a cluster of roses, and she saw only two
  figures&mdash;always the same figures. Her eyes were set, her face was wan
  and old.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The other woman!&rdquo; she murmured to herself. &ldquo;That is
  what I am. And I can&rsquo;t live up to it. I ought to take poison, or get
  run over or something, and I know very well I shan&rsquo;t. Bother the man!
  Why couldn&rsquo;t he leave me alone?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After dinner that evening she accepted her husband&rsquo;s nightly
  invitation and walked with him for a little while. The others followed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How much longer can you stay away from England, Lawrence?&rdquo;
  she asked him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;a fortnight, I should think,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I
  am not tied to any particular date. You like it here, I hope?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Immensely! Are&mdash;our friends going to remain?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard them say anything about moving on yet,&rdquo;
  he answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you in love with the Duchess still, Lawrence?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am I&mdash;Blanche!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry! You made a mistake once, you know.
  Don&rsquo;t make another. I&rsquo;m not a jealous woman, and I don&rsquo;t
  ask much from you, but I&rsquo;m your wife. That&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She turned and called to Hester. The little party rearranged itself.
  Mannering found himself with Berenice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What was your wife saying to you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was the beginning,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

  <p>Berenice sighed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a strange thing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but in this world no
  one can ever be happy except at some one else&rsquo;s expense. It is a most
  unnatural law of compensation. Shall we move on to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The day after,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;To- morrow we are going to
  Berneval.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are queer people, I think,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have been
  perfectly satisfied this week simply to be with you. When it comes to an end
  I should like it to come suddenly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He thought of her words an hour later, when on his return to the hotel
  they handed him a telegram. He passed it on at once to Lord Redford, and
  glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor Cunningham,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was a short triumph for
  him. I must go back to-night, or the first train to-morrow morning. The
  sitting member for my division of Leeds died suddenly last night,
  Blanche,&rdquo; he said to his wife. &ldquo;I must be on the spot at
  once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will go and pack,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>Lady Redford followed her very soon. Clara and Sir Leslie had not yet
  returned from their stroll. Lord Redford remained alone with them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I scarcely know what sort of fortune to wish you, Mannering,&rdquo;
  he said. &ldquo;Perhaps your first speech will tell us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice leaned back in her chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine you as a labour member in the least,&rdquo;
  she remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t this force your hand a little, Mannering?&rdquo; Lord
  Redford said. &ldquo;I understand that you were anxious to avoid a direct
  pronouncement upon the fiscal policy for the present.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is quite time I made up my mind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I shall
  do so now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May we find ourselves in the same lobby!&rdquo; Lord Redford said.
  &ldquo;I will go and find my man. He may as well take you to the station in
  the car.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice smiled at Mannering luminously through the shadowy lights.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear friend,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am delighted that you are
  going. Our little time here has been delightful, but we had reached its
  limit. I like to think that you are going back into the thick of it.
  Don&rsquo;t be faint- hearted, Lawrence. Don&rsquo;t lose faith in yourself.
  You have chosen a terribly lonely path; if any man can find his way to the
  top, you can. And don&rsquo;t dare to forget me, sir!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He caught her cheerful tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are inspiring,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Thank heaven, I have
  a twelve hours&rsquo; journey before me. I need time for thought, if ever a
  man did.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it,&rdquo; she answered, lightly.
  &ldquo;The truth is somewhere in your brain, I suppose, and when the time
  comes you will find it. Much better think about your sandwiches.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The car backed into the yard. Blanche reappeared, and behind her
  Mannering&rsquo;s bag.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do hope that Hester and I have packed everything,&rdquo; she
  said. &ldquo;We could come over to-morrow, if there&rsquo;s anything you want
  us for. If not we shall stay here for another week. Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She calmly held up her lips, and Mannering kissed them after a
  moment&rsquo;s hesitation. She remained by his side even when he turned to
  say farewell to Berenice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sure you ought to be going,&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;I
  will send on your letters if there are any to-morrow. Wire your address as
  soon as you arrive. Good luck!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The car glided away. They all stood in a group to see him go, and waved
  indiscriminate farewells. Blanche moved a little apart as the car
  disappeared, and Berenice watched her curiously. She was rubbing her lips
  with her handkerchief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A sting!&rdquo; she remarked, becoming suddenly aware of the
  other&rsquo;s scrutiny. &ldquo;Nothing that hurts very much!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b304"
     name="ref-b304"></a>IV. &mdash; DISASTER</h2>

  <p>Mannering, in his sitting-room at last, locked the door and drew a long
  breath of relief. Upon his ear-drums there throbbed still the yells of his
  enthusiastic but noisy adherents&mdash;the truculent cries of those who had
  heard his great speech with satisfaction, of those who saw pass from amongst
  themselves to a newer school of thought one whom they had regarded as their
  natural leader. It was over at last. He had made his pronouncement. To some
  it might seem a compromise. To himself it was the only logical outcome of his
  long period of thought. He spoke for the workingman. He demanded inquiry,
  consideration, experiment. He demanded them in a way of his own, at once
  novel and convincing. Many of the most brilliant articles which had ever come
  from his pen he abjured. He drew a sharp line between the province of the
  student and the duty of the politician.</p>

  <p>And now he was alone at last, free to think and dream, free to think of
  Bonestre, to wonder what reports of his meeting would reach the little French
  watering-place, and how they would be received. He could see Berenice reading
  the morning paper in the little grey courtyard, with the pigeons flying above
  her head and the sunlight streaming across the flags. He could hear
  Borrowdean&rsquo;s sneer, could see Lord Redford&rsquo;s shrug of the
  shoulders. There is little sympathy in the world for the man who dares to
  change his mind.</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door, and his servant entered with a tray.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have brought the whiskey and soda, sandwiches and cigarettes,
  sir,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I am sorry to say that there is a person
  outside whom I cannot get rid of. His name is Fardell, and he insists upon it
  that his business is of importance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can show him up at once,&rdquo; he ordered; &ldquo;now, and
  whenever he calls.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Fardell appeared almost directly. Mannering had seen him before during the
  day, but noticed at once a change in him. He was pale, and looked like a man
  who had received some sort of a shock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come in, Fardell, and sit down,&rdquo; Mannering said. &ldquo;You
  look tired. Have a drink.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Fardell walked straight to the tray and helped himself to some neat
  whiskey.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had
  rather a knockout blow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He emptied the tumbler and set it down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Mannering, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just heard a
  man bet twenty to one in crisp five-pound bank- notes that you never sit for
  West Leeds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was he drunk or sober?&rdquo; Mannering asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sober as a judge!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How often did you take him?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not once! I didn&rsquo;t dare!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering, who had been in the act of helping himself to a whiskey and
  soda, looked around with the decanter in his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; he said, bewildered.
  &ldquo;You know very well that the chances, so far as they can be reckoned
  up, are slightly in my favour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They were!&rdquo; Fardell answered. &ldquo;Heaven knows what they
  are now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering was a little annoyed. It seemed to him that Fardell must have
  been drinking.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you mind explaining yourself?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can do so,&rdquo; Fardell answered. &ldquo;I must do so. But
  while I am about it I want you to put on your hat and come with
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering laughed shortly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What, to-night?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;No, thank you. Be
  reasonable, Fardell. I&rsquo;ve had my day&rsquo;s work, and I think
  I&rsquo;ve earned a little rest. To be frank with you, I don&rsquo;t like
  mysteries. If you&rsquo;ve anything to say, out with it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; Richard Fardell answered. &ldquo;I am going to ask
  you a question, Mr. Mannering. Go back a good many years, as many years as
  you like. Is there anything in your life as a younger man, say when you first
  entered Parliament, which&mdash;if it were brought up against you
  now&mdash;might be&mdash;embarrassing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering did not answer for several moments. He was already pale and
  tired, but he felt what little colour remained leave his face. Least of all
  he had expected this. Even now&mdash;what could the man mean? What could be
  known?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not sure that I understand you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There
  is nothing that could be known! I am sure of that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is a person,&rdquo; Fardell said, slowly, &ldquo;who has made
  extraordinary statements. Our opponents have got hold of him. The substance
  of them is this: He says that many years ago you were the lover of a married
  woman, that you sold her husband worthless shares and ruined him, and that
  finally&mdash;in a quarrel&mdash;he declares that he was an eye- witness of
  this&mdash;that you killed him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering slowly subsided into his chair. His cheeks were blanched.
  Richard Fardell watched him with feverish anxiety.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a lie,&rdquo; Mannering declared. &ldquo;There is no man
  living who can say this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The man says,&rdquo; Fardell continued, stonily, &ldquo;that his
  name is Parkins, and that he was butler to Mr. Stephen Phillimore eleven
  years ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Parkins is dead!&rdquo; Mannering said, hoarsely. &ldquo;He has
  been dead for many years.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is living in Leeds to-day,&rdquo; Fardell answered. &ldquo;A
  journalist from the <i>Yorkshire Herald</i> was with him for two hours this
  afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blanche&mdash;I was told that he was dead,&rdquo; Mannering
  said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then the story is true?&rdquo; Fardell asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not as you have told it,&rdquo; Mannering answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is truth in it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Richard Fardell was silent for several moments. He paced up and down the
  room, his hands behind his back, his eyebrows contracted into a heavy frown.
  For him it was a bitter moment. He was only a half- educated, illiterate man,
  possessed of sturdy common sense and a wonderful tenacity of purpose. He had
  permitted himself to indulge in a little silent but none the less absolute
  hero-worship, and Mannering had been the hero.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must come with me at once and see this man,&rdquo; he said at
  last. &ldquo;He has not yet signed his statement. We must do what we can to
  keep him quiet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering took up his coat and hat without a word. They left the hotel,
  and Fardell summoned a cab.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a long way,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;We will drive part of
  the distance and walk the rest. We may be watched already.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering nodded. The last blow was so unexpected that he felt in a sense
  numbed. His speech only a few hours ago had made large inroads upon his
  powers of endurance. His partial recantation had cost him many hours of
  torture, from which he was still suffering. And now, without the slightest
  warning, he found himself face to face with a crisis far graver, far more
  acute. Never in his most gloomy moments had he felt any real fear of a
  resurrection of the past such as that with which he was now threatened. It
  was a thunderbolt from a clear sky. Even now he found it hard to persuade
  himself that he was not dreaming.</p>

  <p>They were in the cab for nearly half an hour before Fardell stopped and
  dismissed it. Then they walked up and down and across streets of small
  houses, pitiless in their monotony, squalid and depressing in their
  ugliness.</p>

  <p>Finally Fardell stopped, and without hesitation knocked at the door of one
  of them. It was opened by a man in shirt-sleeves, holding a tallow candle in
  his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What yer want?&rdquo; he inquired, suspiciously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your lodger,&rdquo; Fardell answered, pushing past him and drawing
  Mannering into the room. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man jerked his thumb upwards.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where he won&rsquo;t be long,&rdquo; he answered, shortly.
  &ldquo;The likes of &lsquo;im having visitors, and one a toff, too. Say, are
  yer going to pay his rent?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We may do that,&rdquo; Fardell answered. &ldquo;Is he
  upstairs?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; the man answered, shuffling away. &ldquo;Pay &lsquo;is
  rent, and yer can chuck &lsquo;im out of the winder, if yer like!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They climbed the crazy staircase. Fardell opened the door of the room
  above without even the formality of knocking. An old man sat there, bending
  over a table, half dressed. Before him were several sheets of paper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe we&rsquo;re in time,&rdquo; Fardell muttered, half to
  himself. &ldquo;Parkins, is that you?&rdquo; he asked, in a louder tone.</p>

  <p>The old man looked up and blinked at them. He shaded his eyes with one
  hand. The other he laid flat upon the papers before him. He was old,
  blear-eyed, unkempt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that Master Ronaldson?&rdquo; he asked, in a thin, quavering
  tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve signed &lsquo;em, sir. Have yer brought the money?
  I&rsquo;m a poor old man, and I need a drop of something now and then to keep
  the life in me. If yer&rsquo;ll just hand over a trifle I&rsquo;ll send out
  for&mdash;eh&mdash;eh, my landlord, he&rsquo;s a kindly man&mdash;he&rsquo;ll
  fetch it. Eh? Two of yer! I don&rsquo;t see so well as I did. Is that you,
  Mr. Ronaldson, sir?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Fardell threw some silver coins upon the table. The old man snatched them
  up eagerly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Mr. Ronaldson,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I daresay
  we shall do as well. We want to talk to you about those papers
  there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old man nodded. He was gazing at the silver in his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve writ it all out,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I told
  &lsquo;un I would. A pound a week for ten years. That&rsquo;s what I
  &lsquo;ad! And then it stopped! Did she mean me to starve, eh? Not I! John
  Parkins knows better nor that. I&rsquo;ve writ it all out, and there&rsquo;s
  my signature. It&rsquo;s gospel truth, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are going to buy the truth from you,&rdquo; Fardell said.
  &ldquo;We have more money than Ronaldson. Don&rsquo;t be afraid. We have gold
  to spare where Ronaldson had silver.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old man lifted the candle with shaking fingers. Then it dropped with a
  crash to the ground, and lay there for a moment spluttering. He shrank
  back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s &lsquo;im!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill
  me, sir. I mean you no harm. It&rsquo;s Mr. Mannering!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b305"
     name="ref-b305"></a>V. &mdash; THE JOURNALIST INTERVENES</h2>

  <p>The old man had sunk into a seat. His face and hands were twitching with
  fear. His eyes, as though fascinated, remained fixed upon Mannering&rsquo;s.
  All the while he mumbled to himself. Fardell drew Mannering a little on one
  side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What can we do with him?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;We might tear up
  those sheets, give him money, keep him soddened with drink. And even then
  he&rsquo;d give the whole show away the moment any one got at him. It
  isn&rsquo;t so bad as he makes out, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is not so bad as that,&rdquo; Mannering answered, &ldquo;but it
  is bad enough.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What became of the woman?&rdquo; Fardell asked.
  &ldquo;Parkins&rsquo;s mistress, I mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is my wife,&rdquo; Mannering answered.</p>

  <p>Fardell threw out his hands with a little gesture of despair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We must get him away from here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If Polden
  gets hold of him you might as well resign at once. It is dangerous for you to
  stay. He was evidently expecting that fellow Ronaldson to- night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What shall you do with him?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hide him if I can,&rdquo; Fardell answered, grimly. &ldquo;If I can
  get him out of this place, it ought not to be impossible. The most important
  thing at present is for you to get away without being recognized.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering took up his hat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I shall leave the cab for you. I
  can find my way back to the hotel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Fardell nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It would be better,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Turn your coat-collar up
  and draw your hat down over your eyes. You mustn&rsquo;t be recognized down
  here. It&rsquo;s a pretty low part.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Mannering had not reached the corner of the street before he
  heard hasty footsteps behind him, and felt a light touch upon his shoulder.
  He turned sharply round.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, sir!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;what do you want with
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The newcomer was a tall, thin young man, wearing glasses, and although he
  was a complete stranger to Mannering, he knew at once who he was.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Mannering, I believe?&rdquo; he said, quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What has my name to do with you, sir?&rdquo; Mannering answered,
  coldly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mine is Ronaldson,&rdquo; the young man answered. &ldquo;I am a
  reporter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering regarded him steadily for a moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are the young man, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who has
  discovered the mare&rsquo;s nest of my iniquity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If it is a mare&rsquo;s nest,&rdquo; the young man answered,
  briskly, &ldquo;I shall be quite as much relieved as disappointed. But your
  being down here doesn&rsquo;t look very much like that, does it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No man,&rdquo; Mannering answered, &ldquo;hears that a bomb is
  going to be thrown at him without a certain amount of curiosity as to its
  nature. I have been down to examine the bomb. Frankly, I don&rsquo;t think
  much of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are prepared, then, to deny this man Parkins&rsquo;s
  story?&rdquo; the reporter asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am prepared to have a shot at your paper for libel, anyhow, if
  you use it,&rdquo; Mannering answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know the substance of his communication?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can make a pretty good guess at it,&rdquo; Mannering
  answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You really mean to deny it, then?&rdquo; the reporter asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly, for it is not true,&rdquo; Mannering answered.
  &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t let me detain you any longer!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He turned on his heel and walked away, but the reporter kept pace with
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will pardon me, but this is a very serious affair, Mr.
  Mannering,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Serious for both of us. Do you mind
  discussing it with me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; Mannering answered, &ldquo;so long as you
  permit me to continue my way homewards.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will walk with you, sir, if you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; the
  reporter said. &ldquo;It is a very serious matter indeed, this! My people are
  as keen as possible to make use of it. If they do, and it turns out a true
  story, you, of course, will never sit for Leeds. And if on the other hand it
  is false, I shall get the sack!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, it is false,&rdquo; Mannering said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some parts of it, perhaps,&rdquo; the young man answered, smoothly.
  &ldquo;Not all, Mr. Mannering.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Old men are garrulous,&rdquo; Mannering remarked. &ldquo;I expect
  you will find that your friend has been letting his tongue run away with
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He has committed his statements to paper,&rdquo; Ronaldson
  remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And signed them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is willing to do so,&rdquo; the reporter answered. &ldquo;I was
  to have fetched them away to-night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You may be a little late,&rdquo; Mannering remarked.</p>

  <p>The <i>double entente</i> in his tone did not escape Ronaldson&rsquo;s
  notice. He stopped short on the pavement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So you have bought him,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

  <p>Mannering glanced at him superciliously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you pardon me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I remark that this
  conversation has no particular interest for me? Don&rsquo;t let me bring you
  any further out of your way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ronaldson took off his hat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I will wish you
  good-night!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering pursued his way homeward with the briefest of farewells. The
  young reporter retraced his steps. Arrived at Parkins&rsquo;s lodgings he
  mounted the stairs, and found the room empty. He returned and interviewed the
  landlord. From him he only learned that Parkins had departed with one of two
  gentlemen who had come to see him that evening, and that they had paid his
  rent for him. The reporter was obliged to depart with no more satisfactory
  information. But next morning, before nine o&rsquo;clock, he was waiting to
  see Mannering, and would not be denied. He was accompanied, too, by a person
  of no less importance than the editor of the <i>Yorkshire Herald</i>
  himself.</p>

  <p>Mannering kept them waiting an hour, and then received them coolly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you, Mr. Polden,&rdquo; he said, glancing at the
  editor&rsquo;s card. &ldquo;I have already had some conversation with our
  young friend there,&rdquo; he added, glancing towards the reporter.
  &ldquo;What can I have the pleasure of doing for you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Polden produced a sheet of proofs from his pocket. He passed them over
  to Mannering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should like you to examine these, sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In type already!&rdquo; Mannering remarked, calmly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In proof for our evening&rsquo;s issue,&rdquo; Polden answered.</p>

  <p>Mannering read them through.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It will cost you several thousand pounds!&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then the money will be well spent,&rdquo; Polden answered.
  &ldquo;No one has a higher regard for you politically than I have, Mr.
  Mannering, but we don&rsquo;t want you as member for West Leeds. That&rsquo;s
  all!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It happens,&rdquo; Mannering said, &ldquo;that I am particularly
  anxious to sit for West Leeds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will go on&mdash;in the face of this?&rdquo; the editor asked
  Mannering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and with the suit for libel which will follow,&rdquo;
  Mannering answered.</p>

  <p>The editor shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do me the favour to believe, Mr. Mannering,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;that we have not gone into this matter blindfold. We had a preliminary
  intimation as to this affair from a person whose word carries considerable
  weight, and our investigations have been searching. I will admit that the
  disappearance of the man Parkins is a little awkward for us, but we have
  ample justification in publishing his story.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I trust for your sakes that the law courts will support your
  views,&rdquo; Mannering said, coldly. &ldquo;I scarcely think it
  likely.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Mannering,&rdquo; Polden said, &ldquo;I quite appreciate your
  attitude, but do you really think it is a wise one? I very much regret that
  it should have been our duty to unearth this unsavoury story, and having
  unearthed it, to use it. But you must remember that the issue on hand is a
  great one. I belong to the Liberal party and the absolute Free Traders, and I
  consider that for this city to be represented by any one who shows the least
  indication of being unsafe upon this question would be a national disaster
  and a local disgrace. I want you to understand, therefore, that I am not
  playing a game of bluff. The proofs you hold in your hand have been set and
  corrected. Within a few hours the story will stand out in black and white.
  Are you prepared for this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not prepared to resign my candidature, if that is what you
  mean,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I presume that nothing short of that will
  satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; the editor answered, firmly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then there remains nothing more,&rdquo; Mannering remarked, coldly,
  &ldquo;than for me to wish you a very good- morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; Mr. Polden said. &ldquo;I trust you will
  believe, Mr. Mannering, that I find this a very unpleasant duty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering made no answer save a slight bow. He held open the door, and Mr.
  Polden and his satellite passed out. Afterwards he strolled to the window and
  looked down idly upon the crowd.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I act in accordance with the conventions,&rdquo; he murmured to
  himself, &ldquo;I suppose I ought to take, a glass of poison, or blow my
  brains out. Instead of which&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders, and rang for his hat and coat. He was due at
  one of the great foundries in half an hour to speak to the men during their
  luncheon interval.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Instead of which,&rdquo; he muttered, as he lit a cigarette,
  &ldquo;I shall go on to the end.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a id="ref-b306"
     name="ref-b306"></a>VI. &mdash; TREACHERY AND A TELEGRAM</h2>

  <p>The sunlight streamed down into the little grey courtyard of the <i>Leon
  D&rsquo;or</i> at Bonestre. Sir Leslie Borrowdean, in an immaculate grey
  suit, and with a carefully chosen pink carnation in his button-hole, sat
  alone at a small table having his morning coffee. His attention was divided
  between a copy of the <i>Figaro</i> and a little pile of letters and
  telegrams on the other side of his plate. More than once he glanced at the
  topmost of the latter and smiled.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Mannering and Hester came down the grey stone steps and crossed
  towards their own table. The former lingered for a moment as she passed Sir
  Leslie, who rose to greet the two women.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Another glorious day!&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;What news from
  Leeds?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My husband seldom writes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir Leslie smiled reflectively, and glanced towards the pile of papers at
  his side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;you know better than I do how
  things are going there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no correspondents in Leeds,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

  <p>At that moment a puff of wind disturbed the papers by his side. A telegram
  would have fluttered away, but Blanche Mannering caught it at the edge of the
  table. She was handing it back, when a curious expression on
  Borrowdean&rsquo;s face inspired her with a sudden idea. She deliberately
  looked at the telegram, and her fingers stiffened upon it. His forward
  movement was checked. She stood just out of his reach.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No correspondents in Leeds,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Then what
  about this telegram?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will permit me to remind you,&rdquo; he said, stretching out
  his hand for it, &ldquo;that it is addressed to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her hands were behind her. She leaned over towards him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It can be addressed to you a thousand times over,&rdquo; she
  answered, &ldquo;but before I part with it I want to know what it
  means.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean was thinking quickly. He wanted to gain time.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not even know which document you have&mdash;purloined,&rdquo;
  he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is from Leeds,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and it is signed
  Polden. &lsquo;Parkins found, has made statement, appears to-night.&rsquo;
  Can you explain what this means, Sir Leslie Borrowdean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her voice was scarcely raised above a whisper, but there was a dangerous
  glitter in her eyes. There were few traces left of the woman whom once before
  he had found so easy a tool.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It is not an affair
  for you to concern yourself with at all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not an affair for me to concern myself about!&rdquo; she repeated,
  leaning a little over towards him. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it my husband against
  whom you are scheming? Don&rsquo;t I know what low tricks you are capable of?
  Isn&rsquo;t this another proof of it? Not an affair for me to concern myself
  about, indeed! Didn&rsquo;t you worm the whole miserable story out of
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Mannering!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She checked a torrent of words. Her bosom was heaving underneath her lace
  blouse. She was pale almost to the lips. The sudden and complete disuse of
  all manner of cosmetics had to a certain extent blanched her face. There was
  room there now for the writing of tragedy. Borrowdean, still outwardly suave,
  was inwardly cursing the unlucky chance which had blown the telegram her
  way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Might I suggest,&rdquo; he said, in a low tone, &ldquo;that we
  postpone our conversation till after breakfast time? The waiters seem to be
  favouring us with a great deal of attention, and several of them understand
  English.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She did not even turn her head. Thinner a good deal since her marriage,
  she seemed to him to have grown taller, to have gained in dignity and
  presence, as she stood there before him, her angry eyes fixed upon his face.
  She was no longer a person to be ignored.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must tell me about this&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or?&rdquo; he repeated, stonily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or I will make a public statement,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;If
  you ruin my husband&rsquo;s career, I can at least do the same with yours.
  Politics is supposed to be a game for honourable men to play with honourable
  weapons. I wonder if Lord Redford would approve of your methods?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can go and ask him, my dear madam,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I
  am perfectly ready to defend myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Defend! You have no defence,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Can you
  deny that you are plotting to keep my husband out of Parliament now, just as
  a few months ago you plotted to bring him back? You are making use of a
  personal secret, a forgotten chapter of his life, to move him about like a
  puppet to do your will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I work for the good of a cause and a great party,&rdquo; he
  answered. &ldquo;You do not understand these things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I understand you so far as this,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You
  are one of those to whom life is a chessboard, and your one aim is to make
  the pieces work for you, and at your bidding, till you sit in the place you
  covet. There isn&rsquo;t much of the patriot about you, Sir Leslie
  Borrowdean.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He glanced down at his unfinished breakfast. He had the air of one who is
  a little bored.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is this discussion really
  worth while?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, bluntly, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t. You are
  quite right. We are wandering from the subject.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us talk,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;after breakfast. Give me
  back that telegram now, and I will explain it, say, in the garden in half an
  hour. I detest cold coffee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can do like me, order some fresh,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If I
  let you out of my sight I know very well how much I shall see of you for the
  rest of the day. Explain now if you can. What does that telegram
  mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Surely it is obvious enough,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The man
  Parkins, whom you told me was dead, is alive and in Leeds. He has seen
  Mannering&rsquo;s name about, has been talking, and the press have got hold
  of his story. I am sorry, but there was always this possibility, wasn&rsquo;t
  there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And this telegram?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know Polden, the editor of the paper, and he referred to me to
  know if there could be any truth in it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;These are lies!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;You were the
  instigator. You set them on the track.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have nothing more to say,&rdquo; Borrowdean declared, coldly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I shall take this telegram to Lord
  Redford. I shall tell him everything!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A faint smile flickered upon Borrowdean&rsquo;s lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord Redford would, I am sure, be charmed to hear your
  story,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Unfortunately he started for Dieppe this
  morning before eight o&rsquo;clock, and will not be back until
  to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And to-morrow will be too late,&rdquo; she added, rapidly pursuing
  his train of thought. &ldquo;Then I will try the Duchess!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He started very slightly, but she saw it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sit down for a moment, Mrs. Mannering,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>She accepted the chair he placed for her. There was a distinct change in
  his manner. He realized that this woman held a trump card against him. Even
  in her hands it might mean disaster.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blanche&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;I prefer &lsquo;Mrs.
  Mannering.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He bit his lips in annoyance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Mannering, then,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;we have been
  allies before, and I think that you will admit that I have always kept faith
  with you. I don&rsquo;t see any reason why we should play at being enemies.
  You have a price, I suppose, for that telegram and your silence. Name
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I have a price,&rdquo; she admitted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Remember that, after all, this is not a great issue,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;If your husband does not get in for Leeds he will probably find
  a seat somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is false,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;If your man Polden
  publishes Parkins&rsquo;s story my husband&rsquo;s political career is over,
  and you know it. Do keep as near to the truth as you can.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will give you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;five hundred pounds for
  that telegram and your silence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She rose slowly to her feet. A dull flush of colour mounted almost to her
  eyes. Borrowdean watched her anxiously. Then for a moment came an
  interruption. The Duchess was descending the grey stone steps from the
  hotel.</p>

  <p>She had addressed some word of greeting to them. They both turned towards
  her. She wore a white serge dress, and she carried a white lace parasol over
  her bare head. She moved towards them with her usual languid grace, followed
  by her maid carrying a tiny Maltese dog and a budget of letters. The
  loiterrers in the courtyard stared at her with admiration. It was impossible
  to mistake her for anything but a great lady.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have the air of conspirators, you two!&rdquo; she said, as she
  approached them. &ldquo;Is it an expedition for the day that you are
  planning?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blanche Mannering turned her back upon Borrowdean.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir Leslie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;has just offered me five
  hundred pounds for a telegram which I have here and for my silence concerning
  its contents. I was wondering whether he had bid high enough.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Duchess looked from one to the other. She almost permitted herself to
  be astonished. Borrowdean&rsquo;s face was dark with anger. Blanche
  Mannering&rsquo;s apparent calmness was obviously of the surface only.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miserably so!&rdquo; Blanche answered. &ldquo;Sir Leslie has
  strange ideas of honour, I find. He is making use of a story which I told him
  once concerning my husband, to drive him out of political life. Duchess, will
  you do me the favour to let me talk with you for five minutes, and to make
  Sir Leslie Borrowdean promise not to leave this hotel till you have seen him
  again?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no intention of leaving the hotel,&rdquo; Sir Leslie said,
  stiffly.</p>

  <p>Berenice pointed to her table.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come and take your coffee with me, Mrs. Mannering,&rdquo; she
  said.</p>

  <p>Mannering passed through the day like a man in a nightmare. He addressed
  two meetings of working-men, and interviewed half a dozen of his workers. At
  mid-day the afternoon edition of the <i>Yorkshire Herald</i> was being sold
  in the streets. He bought a copy and glanced it feverishly through. Nothing!
  He lunched and went on with his work. At three o&rsquo;clock a second edition
  was out. Again he purchased a copy, and again there was nothing. The suspense
  was getting worse even than the disaster itself. Between four and five they
  brought him in a telegram. He tore it open, and found that it was from
  Bonestre. The words seemed to stare up at him from the pink form. It was
  incredible:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Polden muzzled. Go in and win.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The form fluttered from his fingers on to the floor of his sitting- room.
  He stood looking at it, dazed. Outside, a mob of people, standing round his
  carriage, were shouting his name.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b307"
     name="ref-b307"></a>VII. &mdash; MR. MANNERING, M.P.</h2>

  <p>Mannering threw up his window with a sigh of immense relief. The air was
  cold and fresh. The land, as yet unwarmed by the slowly rising sun, was hung
  with a faint autumn mist. Traces of an early frost lay in the brown hedgerows
  inland; the sea was like a sheet of polished glass. Gone the smoke- stained
  rows of shapeless houses, the atmosphere polluted by a thousand chimneys
  belching smuts and black vapour, the clanging of electric cars, the rattle of
  all manner of vehicles over the cobbled streets. Gone the hoarse excitement
  of the shouting mobs, the poisonous atmosphere of close rooms, all the
  turmoil and racket and anxiety of those fighting days. He was back again in
  Bonestre. Below in the courtyard the white cockatoo was screaming. The
  waiters in their linen coats were preparing the tables for the few remaining
  guests. And the other things were of yesterday!</p>

  <p>Mannering had arrived in the middle of the night unexpectedly, and his
  appearance was a surprise to every one. He had knocked at his wife&rsquo;s
  door on his way downstairs, but Blanche had taken to early rising, and was
  already down. He found them all breakfasting together in a sheltered corner
  of the courtyard.</p>

  <p>Berenice, after the usual greetings and explanations, smiled at him
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not sure,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;whether I ought to
  congratulate you or not. Sir Leslie here thinks that you mean
  mischief!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only on the principle,&rdquo; Borrowdean said, &ldquo;that whoever
  is not with us is against us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are all agreed upon one thing,&rdquo; Berenice said. &ldquo;It
  was your last speech, the one the night before the election, which carried
  you in. A national party indeed! A legislator, not a politician! You talked
  to those canny Yorkshiremen with your head in the clouds, and yet they
  listened.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering smiled as he poured out his coffee.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I talked common sense to them,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;and
  Yorkshiremen like that. We have been slaves to the old- fashioned idea of
  party Government long enough. It&rsquo;s an absurd thing when you come to
  think of it. Fancy a great business being carried on by a board of partners
  of divergent views, and unable to make a purchase or a sale or effect any
  change whatever without talking the whole thing threadbare, and then voting
  upon it. The business would go down, of course!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Party Government,&rdquo; Borrowdean declared, &ldquo;is the natural
  evolution of any republican form of administration. A nation that chooses its
  own representatives must select them from its varying standpoint.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Their views may differ slightly upon some matters,&rdquo; Mannering
  said, &ldquo;but their first duty should be to come into accord with one
  another. It is a matter for compromises, of course. The real differences
  between intelligent men of either party are very slight. The trouble is that
  under the present system everything is done to increase them instead of
  bridging them over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you had to form a Government, then,&rdquo; Berenice asked,
  &ldquo;you would not choose the members from one party?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; Mannering answered. &ldquo;Supposing I were
  the owner of Redford&rsquo;s car there, and wanted a driver. I should simply
  try to get the best man I could, and I should certainly not worry as to
  whether he were, say, a churchman or a dissenter. The best man for the post
  is what the country has a right to expect, whatever he may call himself, and
  the country doesn&rsquo;t get it. The people pay the piper, and I consider
  that they get shocking bad value for their money. The Boer War, for instance,
  would have cost us less than half as much if we had had the right men to
  direct the commercial side of it. That money would have been useful in the
  country just now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An absolute monarchy,&rdquo; Hester said, smiling, &ldquo;would be
  really the most logical form of Government, then? But would it
  answer?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Borrowdean asked. &ldquo;If the monarch were
  incapable he would of course be shot!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A dictator&mdash;&rdquo; Berenice began, but Mannering held out his
  hands, laughing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Think of my last few days, and spare me!&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;I
  have thirty-six hours&rsquo; holiday. How do you people spend your time
  here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice took him away with her as a matter of course. Blanche watched
  them depart with a curious tightening of the lips. She was standing alone in
  the gateway of the hotel, and she watched them until they were out of sight.
  Borrowdean, sauntering out to buy some papers, paused for a moment as he
  passed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your husband, Mrs. Mannering,&rdquo; he said, drily, &ldquo;is a
  very fortunate man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She made no reply, and Borrowdean passed on. Hester came out with a
  message from Lady Redford&mdash;would Mrs. Mannering care to motor over to
  Berneval for luncheon? Blanche shook her head. She scarcely heard the
  invitation. She was still watching the two figures disappearing in the
  distance. Hester understood, but she spoke lightly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that the Duchess still has hopes
  of Mr. Mannering.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is a persistent woman,&rdquo; Blanche answered. &ldquo;They say
  that she generally succeeds. Let us go in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice was listening to Mannering&rsquo;s account of his last few
  days&rsquo; electioneering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The whole affair came upon me like a thunderclap,&rdquo; he told
  her. &ldquo;Richard Fardell found it out somehow, and he took me to see
  Parkins. But it was too late. Polden had hold of the story and meant to use
  it. I never imagined but that Parkins had been talking and this journalist
  had got hold of him by accident. Now I understand that it was Borrowdean who
  was pulling the strings.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He traced Parkins out some time ago, and knew exactly where he was
  to be found.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Mannering said, &ldquo;that it is time Borrowdean
  and I came to some understanding. I haven&rsquo;t said anything about it yet.
  I don&rsquo;t exactly know what to say now. You are a very generous
  woman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that. Sir Leslie is
  a schemer of the class I detest. I listened to him once, and I have regretted
  it ever since. Yet you must remember this! If it had not been for him you
  would have been at Blakely to-day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His thoughts carried him backwards with a rush. Once more the thrall of
  that quiet life of passionless sweetness held him. He looked back upon it
  curiously, as a man who has passed into another country. Days of physical
  exaltation, alone with the sun and the wind and all the murmuring voices of
  Nature, God&rsquo;s life he had called it then. And now! The stress of battle
  was hard upon him. He was fighting in the front ranks, a somewhat cheerless
  battle, fighting for great causes with inefficient weapons. But he could not
  go back. Life had become a more strenuous, a more vital, a less beautiful
  thing! He felt himself ageing. All the inevitable sadness of the man in touch
  with the world&rsquo;s great problems was in his heart. But he could not go
  back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, quietly, &ldquo;I owe that much to
  Borrowdean.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is a question,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;which I have wanted to
  ask you. Do you regret, or are you glad to have been forced out once more
  upon the world&rsquo;s stage?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How can I answer you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;At Blakely I was as
  happy as I knew how to be, and until you came I was content! But to-day,
  well, there are different things. How can I answer your question, indeed?
  Tell me what happiness means! Tell me whether it is an ignoble or a
  praiseworthy state!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice was silent. Into her face there had come a sudden gravity.
  Mannering, glancing towards her, was at once conscious of the change. He saw
  the weariness so often and zealously repressed, the ageing of her face, the
  sudden triumph of the despair which in the quiet moments chilled her heart.
  It seemed to him that for that moment they had come into some closer
  communion. He bent over towards her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;you, too, are beginning to
  understand. Happiness is only for the ignorant. For you and for me knowledge
  has eaten its way too far into our lives. We climb all the while, but the
  flowers in the meadows are the fairest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The little white flower which grows in the mountains is what we
  must always seek,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;The meadows are for the
  others.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are accursed with this knowledge, and the desire for it,&rdquo;
  he declared, fiercely. &ldquo;The suffering is for us, and the joy for the
  beasts of the field. Why not throw down the cards? We are the devil&rsquo;s
  puppets in this game of life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is no place for us down there,&rdquo; she answered, sadly.
  &ldquo;There is joy enough for them, because the finger has never touched
  their eyes. But for us&mdash;no, we have to go on! I was a foolish woman,
  Lawrence. I lost my sense of proportion. Traditions, you see, were hard to
  break away from. I did not understand. Let this be the end of all mention of
  such things between us. We have missed the turning, and we must go on. That
  is the hardest thing in life. One can never retrace one&rsquo;s
  steps.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We go on&mdash;apart?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We must,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think me prejudiced,
  Lawrence. I must stand by my party. Theoretically, I think that you are the
  only logical politician I have ever known. Actually, I think that you are
  steering your course towards the sandbanks. You will fail, but you will fail
  magnificently. Well, that is something.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a good deal,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but if I live long
  enough, and my strength remains, I shall succeed. I shall place the
  Government of this country upon an altogether different basis. I shall empty
  the work- houses and fill the factories. Nothing short of that will content
  me. Nothing short of that would content any man upon whose shoulders the
  burden has fallen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have centuries of prejudice to fight,&rdquo; she warned him.
  &ldquo;You may not succeed! Yet you have all my good wishes. I shall always
  watch you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They turned homeward in silence. All that had passed between them seemed
  to be already far back in the past. Their retrogression seemed almost
  symbolical. They spoke of indifferent things.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;how you came to know what was
  going on in Leeds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was your wife,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;who discovered
  it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My wife?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She saw a telegram on Sir Leslie&rsquo;s table at breakfast, a
  telegram from the man Polden. She read it and demanded an explanation. Sir
  Leslie tried all he could to wriggle out of it, but in vain. She appealed to
  me. Even I had a great deal of difficulty in dealing with him, but eventually
  he gave way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then the telegram,&rdquo; Mannering asked, &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t that
  from you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was from your wife,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I cannot take much
  credit for myself. It is she whom you must thank for your election. I came
  out at rather a dramatic moment. Sir Leslie had just offered her money, five
  hundred pounds, I think, to give him back his telegram and say nothing. She
  appealed to me at once, and Sir Leslie looked positively foolish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am much obliged to you for telling me,&rdquo; Mannering muttered.
  He remembered now that he had scarcely spoken a dozen words to his wife since
  his return.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Mannering appears to have your interests very much at
  heart,&rdquo; Berenice said, quietly. &ldquo;She proved herself quite a match
  for Sir Leslie. I think that he would have left here at once, only we are
  expecting Clara back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering smiled scornfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not think that even Clara,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is quite
  fool enough not to recognize in Borrowdean the arrant opportunist. For my
  part I am glad that all pretence at friendship between us is now at an end.
  He is one of those men whom I should count more dangerous as a friend than as
  an enemy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice did not reply. They were already in the courtyard of the hotel.
  Blanche was in a wicker chair in a sunny corner, talking to a couple of young
  Englishmen. Berenice turned towards the steps. They parted without any
  further words.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b308"
     name="ref-b308"></a>VIII. &mdash; PLAYING THE GAME</h2>

  <p>Mannering for a moment hesitated. One of the two young men who were
  talking to his wife he recognized as a former acquaintance of hers&mdash;one
  of a genus whom he had little sympathy with and less desire to know. While he
  stood there Blanche laughed at some remark made by one of her companions, and
  the laugh, too, seemed somehow to remind him of the old days. He moved slowly
  forward.</p>

  <p>The young men strolled off almost at once. Mannering took a vacant chair
  by his wife&rsquo;s side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have only just heard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how much I have to
  thank you for. I took it for granted somehow that it was the Duchess who had
  discovered our friend Borrowdean&rsquo;s little scheme and sent that
  telegram. Why didn&rsquo;t you sign it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was the Duchess who made him chuck it up,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;I could never have made him do that. I was an idiot to let Parkins
  stay in England at all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I always understood,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that he was
  dead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I let you think so,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I thought you might
  worry. But seriously, if he told the truth, now, after all these years, would
  any one take any notice of it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very likely not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so far as regards any
  criminal responsibility. But our political life is fenced about by all the
  middle-class love of propriety and hatred of all form of scandal.
  Parkins&rsquo;s story, authenticated or not, would have lost me my seat for
  Leeds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I am very glad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I happened to see
  the telegram. Do you know where Parkins is now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One of my supporters,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a queer little man
  named Richard Fardell, has him in tow. He is bringing him up to London, I
  think.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are you doing this afternoon?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>She looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Englehall has asked me to go out in his car,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;I am rather tired of motoring, but I think I shall go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering lit a cigarette which he had just taken from his case.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

  <p>She turned her head slowly, and looked at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;How can it concern you? Your
  plans for the afternoon are, I presume, already made!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It may not concern me directly,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but I
  have an idea that Mr. Englehall is not exactly the sort of person I care to
  have you driving about with.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laughed hardly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am most flattered by your interest in me,&rdquo; she declared.
  &ldquo;Pray consider Mr. Englehall disposed of. You have some other plans,
  perhaps?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you care to,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we will walk down to the
  club for lunch and come home by the sea.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly! Unless you choose to bring Hester.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She rose slowly to her feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let us go alone. It will be almost the
  first time since we were married, I think. I am curious to see how much I can
  bore you! Will you wait here while I find a hat?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She disappeared inside the hotel. Mannering watched her absently. In a
  vague sort of way he was wondering what it was that had made their married
  life so completely a failure. He had imagined her as asking very little from
  him, content with the shelter of his name and home, content at any rate
  without those things of which he had made no mention when he had spoken to
  her of marriage. And he was becoming gradually aware that it was not so. She
  expected, had hoped for more. The terms which he had zealously striven to
  cultivate with her were terms of which she clearly did not approve. The signs
  of revolt were already apparent.</p>

  <p>Mannering became absorbed in thought. He remembered clearly the feelings
  with which he had gone to her and made his offer. He went over it all again.
  Surely he had made himself understood? But then there was her confession to
  him, the confession of her love. He had ignored that, but it was
  unforgetable. Had he not tacitly accepted the whole situation? If so, was he
  doing his duty? The shelter of his name and home, what were those to a
  warm-hearted woman, if she loved him? He had married her, loving another
  woman. She must have known this, but did she understand that he was not
  prepared to make any effort to accept the inevitable? He was still deep in
  thought when Berenice came out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are you doing there all by yourself?&rdquo; she asked.
  &ldquo;Where is your wife?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She has gone to get a hat,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;We thought of
  going to the club for <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A delightful idea,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do invite me, and I will
  take you in the car. Mrs. Mannering likes motoring, I know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We shall be delighted!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She beckoned to her chauffer, who was in the courtyard. Just then Blanche
  came out. She had changed her gown for one of plain white serge, and she wore
  a hat of tuscan straw which Mannering had once admired.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t mind motoring, Mrs. Mannering?&rdquo; Berenice
  said, as she approached. &ldquo;I have invited myself to luncheon with you,
  and I am going to take you round to the club in the car.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blanche stood quite still for a moment. The sun was in her eyes, and she
  lowered her parasol for a moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It will be very pleasant,&rdquo; she said, quietly, &ldquo;only I
  think that I will go in and change my hat. I thought that we were going to
  walk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She retraced her steps, walking a little wearily. Berenice came and sat
  down by Mannering&rsquo;s side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope Mrs. Mannering does not object to my coming,&rdquo; she
  said. &ldquo;It occurred to me that she was not particularly
  cordial.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is only her manner,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It is very good
  of you to take us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your wife doesn&rsquo;t like me,&rdquo; Berenice said. &ldquo;I
  wonder why. I thought that I had been rather decent to her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blanche is a little odd,&rdquo; Mannering answered. &ldquo;I am
  afraid that it is my fault. Here are the Redfords. I wonder if they would
  join us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Three,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;is certainly an awkward
  number.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In the end the party became rather a large one, for Lord Redford met some
  old friends at the club who insisted upon their joining tables. In the
  interval, whilst they waited for luncheon, Mannering contrived to have a word
  alone with his wife.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not responsible,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for this enlargement
  of our party. The Duchess invited herself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It does not matter,&rdquo; she declared, listlessly. &ldquo;What
  are you doing afterwards?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Playing golf, I fancy,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You heard what
  Redford said about a foursome.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you are returning&mdash;when?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must leave here at six to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They were leaning over the white palings of the pavilion, looking out upon
  the last green. She seemed to be watching the approach of two players who
  were just coming in.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a long way to come,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;for so short
  a time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The aftermath of a contested election is a thing to escape
  from,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I felt that I wanted to get as far away as
  possible, and then again I wanted to find out who it was who had sent that
  telegram.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They sat apart at luncheon, and Blanche was much quieter than usual. The
  others were all old friends. It seemed to her more than ordinarily apparent
  that she was present on sufferance, accepted as Mannering&rsquo;s wife, as an
  evil to be endured, and, so far as possible, ignored. Mannering himself spoke
  to her now and then across the table. Lord Redford, always good- natured,
  made a few efforts to draw her into the conversation. But it seemed to her
  that she had lost her confidence. The freemasonry of old acquaintance which
  existed between all of them left her outside an invisible but very real
  circle. Words came to her with difficulty. She felt stupid, almost shy. When
  she made an effort to break through it she was acutely conscious of her
  failure. Her laugh was too hard, it lacked sincerity or restraint. The
  cigarette which she smoked out of bravado with her coffee, seemed somehow out
  of place. When at last luncheon was over Mannering left his place and came
  over to her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Duchess and I,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are going to play Lord
  Redford and Mrs. Arbuthnot. Won&rsquo;t you walk round with us? The links are
  really very pretty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, I hate watching golf,&rdquo; she answered, rising and
  shaking out her skirt. &ldquo;Hester and I will walk home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do take the car, Mrs. Mannering,&rdquo; Berenice said. &ldquo;It
  will simply be waiting here doing nothing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Blanche answered. &ldquo;I shall enjoy the
  walk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The foursome was played in very leisurely fashion. There was plenty of
  time for conversation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand your wife,&rdquo; Berenice said to
  Mannering. &ldquo;Her dislike of me is a little too obvious. What does it
  mean? Do you know?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook his head. He was looking very pale and tired.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not sure that I know anything about it at all,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;I am beginning to distrust my own judgment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your marriage&mdash;&rdquo; she began, thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us talk about it,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;I
  tried to pay a debt. It seems to me that I have only incurred a fresh
  one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They were silent for some time. Then their opponents lost a ball and
  displayed no particular diligence in attempting to find it. Berenice sat down
  upon a plank seat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your marriage,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;seemed always to me a piece
  of quixotism. I never altogether understood it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was an affair of impulse,&rdquo; he said, slowly. &ldquo;Life
  from a personal point of view had lost all interest to me. I did not dream
  after my&mdash;shall we call it apostacy?&mdash;that I could rely upon even a
  modicum of your friendship. I looked upon myself as an outcast commencing
  life afresh. Then chance intervened. I thought I saw my way to making some
  atonement to a woman whose life I had certainly helped to ruin. That was
  where the serious part of the mistake came. I thought what I had to offer
  would be sufficient. I am beginning now to doubt it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what are you going to do?&rdquo; she asked, looking steadily
  away from him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heaven knows,&rdquo; he answered, bitterly. &ldquo;I cannot give
  what I do not possess.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Was it his fancy, or was there a gleam of satisfaction about her still,
  pale face? He went on.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to play the hypocrite. On the other hand I
  don&rsquo;t want all that I have done to go for nothing. Can you advise
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, nor any one else,&rdquo; she answered, softly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yet I can perhaps correct a little your point of view. I think that
  you overestimate your indebtedness to the woman whom you have made your wife.
  Her husband was a weak, dissipated creature and he was a doomed man long
  before that unfortunate day. It is even very questionable whether that scene
  in which you figured had anything whatever to do in hastening his death. That
  is a good many years ago, and ever since then you seem to have impoverished
  yourself to find her the means to live in luxury. I consider that you paid
  your debt over and over again, and that your final act of self- abnegation
  was entirely uncalled for. What more she wants from you I do not know.
  Perhaps I can imagine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. She turned her head and looked at
  him&mdash;looked him in the eyes unshamed, yet with her secret shining there
  for him to see.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There may be others, Lawrence,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to whom you
  owe something. A woman cannot take back what she has given. There may be
  sufferers in the world whom you ought also to consider. And a woman loves to
  think that what she may not have herself is at least kept sacred&mdash;to her
  memory.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fore!&rdquo; cried Lord Redford, who had found his ball.
  &ldquo;Awfully decent of you people to wait so long. We were afraid you meant
  to claim the hole!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering rose to play his shot.</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;The Duchess and I, Lord Redford,&rdquo; he said, lightly,
  &ldquo;scorn to take small advantages. We mean to play the game!&rdquo;</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b309"
     name="ref-b309"></a>IX. &mdash; THE TRAGEDY OF A KEY</h2>

  <p>Blanche, in a plain black net gown, sat on Lord Redford&rsquo;s right hand
  at the hastily improvised dinner party that evening. Berenice, more subtly
  and more magnificently dressed, was opposite, by Mannering&rsquo;s side. The
  conversation seemed mostly to circle about them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A very charming place,&rdquo; Lord Redford declared. &ldquo;I have
  enjoyed my stay here thoroughly. Let us hope that we may all meet here again
  next year,&rdquo; he added, raising his glass. &ldquo;Mannering, you will
  drink to that, I hope?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; Mannering answered. &ldquo;And you,
  Blanche?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She raised her almost untasted glass and touched it with her lips. She set
  it down with a faint smile. Berenice moved her head towards him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your wife is not very enthusiastic,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She neither plays golf nor bathes,&rdquo; Mannering said. &ldquo;It
  is possible that she finds it a little dull.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Both are habits which it is possible to acquire,&rdquo; Berenice
  answered. &ldquo;I am telling your husband, Mrs. Mannering,&rdquo; she
  continued, &ldquo;that you ought to learn to play golf.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lawrence has offered to teach me more than once,&rdquo; Blanche
  answered, calmly. &ldquo;I am afraid that games do not attract me. Besides, I
  am too old to learn!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Mannering!&rdquo; Lord Redford protested.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am forty-two,&rdquo; Blanche replied, &ldquo;and at that age a
  woman thinks twice before she begins anything new in the shape of vigorous
  exercise. Besides, I find plenty to amuse me here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Might one ask in what direction?&rdquo; Berenice murmured. &ldquo;I
  have found in the place many things that are delightful, but not
  amusing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I find amusement often in watching my neighbours,&rdquo; Blanche
  said. &ldquo;I like to ask myself what it is they want, and to study their
  way of attaining it. You generally find that every one is fairly transparent
  when once you have found the key&mdash;and everybody is trying for something
  which they don&rsquo;t care for other people to know about.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Duchess looked at Blanche steadily. There was a certain insolence, the
  insolence of her aristocratic birth and assured position in the level stare
  of her clear brown eyes. But Blanche did not flinch.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had no idea, Mrs. Mannering, that you had tastes of that
  sort,&rdquo; Berenice said, languidly. &ldquo;Suppose you give us a few
  examples.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not for the world,&rdquo; Blanche answered, fervently. &ldquo;Did
  you say that we were to have coffee outside, Lord Redford? How delightful! I
  wonder if Lady Redford is ready.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They all trooped out in a minute or two. Berenice laid her hand upon
  Mannering&rsquo;s arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your wife,&rdquo; she said, quietly, &ldquo;is going a little too
  far. She is getting positively rude to me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering muttered some evasive reply. He, too, had marked the note of
  battle in Blanche&rsquo;s tone. He had noticed, too, the unusual restraint of
  her manner. She had drunk little or no wine at dinner time, and she had
  talked quietly and sensibly. Directly they reached the courtyard she seated
  herself on a settee for two, and made room for him by her side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come and tell me about the golf match,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Who
  won?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering had no alternative but to obey. Lady Redford, however, drew her
  chair up close to theirs, and the conversation was always general. Berenice
  in a few minutes rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen to the sea,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t some of
  you want to come down to the rocks and watch it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blanche rose up at once.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do come, Lawrence, if you are not too tired!&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>The whole party trooped out on to the promenade. Blanche passed her arm
  through her husband&rsquo;s, and calmly appropriated him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can walk with whom you please presently, Lawrence,&rdquo; she
  said, &ldquo;but I want you for a few minutes. I suppose you will admit that
  I have some claim?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Mannering answered. &ldquo;I have never denied
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am your wife,&rdquo; Blanche said, &ldquo;though heaven knows why
  you ever married me. The Duchess is, I suppose, the woman whom you would have
  married if you hadn&rsquo;t got into a mess with your politics. She is a very
  attractive woman, and you married me, of course, out of pity, or some such
  maudlin reason. But all the same I am here, and&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care what
  you do when I can&rsquo;t see you, but I won&rsquo;t have her make love to
  you before my face.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Duchess is not that sort of woman, Blanche,&rdquo; Mannering
  said, gravely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Blanche remarked, unconvinced. &ldquo;Well,
  I&rsquo;ve watched her, and in my opinion she isn&rsquo;t very different from
  any other sort of woman. Do you wish you were free very much? I know she
  does!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is there any object to be gained by this conversation?&rdquo;
  Mannering asked. &ldquo;Frankly, I don&rsquo;t like it. I made you no absurd
  promises when I married you. I think that you understood the position very
  well. So far as I know I have given you no cause to complain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They had reached the end of the promenade. Blanche leaned over the rail.
  Her eyes seemed fixed upon a light flashing and disappearing across the sea.
  Mannering stood uncomfortably by her side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No cause to complain!&rdquo; she repeated, as though to herself.
  &ldquo;No, I suppose not. And yet, how much the better off do you think I am,
  Lawrence? I had friends before of some sort or another. Some of them
  pretended to like me, even if they didn&rsquo;t. I did as I chose. I lived as
  I liked. I was my own mistress. And now&mdash;well, there is no one! I enjoy
  the respectability of your name, the privilege of knowing your friends, the
  ability to pay my bills, but I should go stark mad if it wasn&rsquo;t for
  Hester. I gave myself away to you, I know. You married me for pity, I know.
  But what in God&rsquo;s name do I get out of it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A note of real passion quivered in her tone. Mannering looked down at her
  helplessly, taken wholly aback, without the power for a moment to formulate
  his thoughts. There was a touch of colour in her pale cheeks, her eyes were
  lit with an unusual fire. The faint moonlight was kind to her. Her features,
  thinner than they had been, seemed to have gained a certain refinement. She
  reminded him more than ever before of the Blanche of many years ago. He
  answered her kindly, almost tenderly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I have caused you any
  suffering. What I did I did for the best. I don&rsquo;t think that I quite
  understood, and I thought that you knew&mdash;what had come into my
  life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I knew that you cared for her, of course,&rdquo; she answered, with
  a little sob, &ldquo;but I did not know that you meant to nurse it&mdash;that
  feeling. I thought that when we were married you would try to care for
  me&mdash;a little. I&mdash;Here are the others!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lord Redford, who had failed to amuse Berenice, and who had a secret
  preference for the woman who generally amused him, broke up their <i>t&ecirc;te-
  &agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>. He led Blanche away, and Mannering followed with Berenice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What does this change in your wife mean?&rdquo; she asked,
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Change?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes! She watches us! If it were not too absurd, one would believe
  her jealous. Of course, it is not my business to ask you on what terms you
  are with your wife, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know what terms,&rdquo; he interrupted.</p>

  <p>Her manner softened. She looked at him for a moment and then her eyes
  dropped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am rather a hateful woman!&rdquo; she said, slowly. &ldquo;I wish
  I had not said that. I don&rsquo;t think we have managed things very
  cleverly, Lawrence. Still, I suppose life is made up of these sorts of
  idiotic blunders.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has been always distinguished by
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And mine,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;only since I came to Blakely, and
  learnt to talk nonsense in your rose-garden! But come,&rdquo; she added, more
  briskly, &ldquo;we are breaking our compact. We agreed to be friends, you
  know, and abjure sentiment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It seemed quite easy then,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And it is easy now! It must be,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;I have
  scarcely congratulated you upon your election. What it all means, and with
  which party you are going to vote, I scarcely know even now. But I can at
  least congratulate you personally.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are generous,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for I suppose I am a
  deserter. As to where I shall sit, it is very hard to tell. I fancy myself
  that we are on the eve of a complete readjustment of parties. Wherever I may
  find myself, however, it will scarcely be with your friends.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I realize that, and I am sorry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;All that we
  need is a leader, and you might have been he. As it is, I suppose we shall
  muddle along somehow until some one comes out of the ruck strong enough to
  pull us together&hellip;. Come and see me in London, Lawrence. Who knows but
  that you may be able to convert me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are too staunch,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and you have not
  seen what I have seen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you once tell me at Blakely that politics for a woman
  was a mischosen profession&mdash;that we were at once too obstinate and too
  sentimental? Perhaps you were right. We don&rsquo;t come into touch with the
  same forces that you meet with, and we come into touch with others which make
  the world seem curiously upside-down. Good-night, Lawrence! I am going to my
  room quietly. Lady Redford wants to play bridge, and I don&rsquo;t feel like
  it! <i>Bon voyage!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering stood alone in the little courtyard, lit now with hanging
  lights, and crowded with stray visitors who had strolled in from the streets.
  The rest of the party had gone into the salon beyond, and Mannering felt
  curiously disinclined to join them. Suddenly there was a touch upon his arm.
  He turned round. Blanche was standing there looking up at him. Something in
  her face puzzled him. Her eyes fell before his. She was pale, yet as he
  looked at her a flood of colour rushed into her cheeks. His momentary
  impression of her eyes was that they were very soft and very bright. She had
  thrown off her wrap, and with her left hand was holding up her white skirt.
  Her right hand was clenched as though holding something, and extended timidly
  towards him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wanted to say good-night to you&mdash;and&mdash;there was
  something else&mdash;this!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Something passed from her hand to his, something cold and hard. He looked
  at her in amazement, but she was already on her way up the grey stone steps
  which led from the courtyard into the hotel, and she did not turn back. He
  opened his hand and stared at what he found there. It was a key&mdash;number
  forty-four, <i>Premier &eacute;tage</i>.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b310"
     name="ref-b310"></a>X. &mdash; BLANCHE FINDS A WAY OUT</h2>

  <p>Mannering was conscious of an overpowering desire to be alone. He made his
  way out of the courtyard and back to the promenade. Some of the lights were
  already extinguished, and a slight drizzling rain was falling. He walked at
  once to the further wall, and stood leaning over, looking into the chaos of
  darkness. The key, round which his fingers were still tightly clenched,
  seemed almost to burn his flesh.</p>

  <p>What to do? How much more of himself was he bound to surrender? Through a
  confusion of thoughts some things came to him then very clearly. Amongst
  others the grim, pitiless selfishness of his life. How much must she have
  suffered before she had dared to do this thing! He had taken up a burden and
  adjusted the weight to suit himself. He had had no thought for her, no care
  save that the seemliness of his own absorbed life might not be disturbed. And
  behind it all the other reason. What a pigmy of a man he was, after all.</p>

  <p>A clock from the town struck eleven. He must decide! A vision of her rose
  up before him. He understood now her weakness and her strength. She was an
  ordinary woman, seeking the affection her sex demanded from its legitimate
  source. He understood the coming and going of the colour in her cheeks, her
  strained attempts to please, her barely controlled jealousy. In that mad
  moment when he had planned for her salvation he had imagined that she would
  have understood. What folly! Why should she? The complex workings of his
  innermost nature were scarcely likely to have been patent to her. What right
  had he to build upon that? What right, as an honest man, to contract a debt
  he never meant to pay? If he had not at the moment realized his
  responsibilities that was his own fault. From her point of view they were
  obvious enough, and it was from her point of view as well as his own that
  they must be considered.</p>

  <p>He turned back to the hotel, walking a little unsteadily. All the time he
  was not sure that this was not a dream. And then on the wet pavement he came
  face to face with two cloaked figures, one of whom stopped short and called
  him by name. It was Berenice!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he exclaimed, more than ever sure that he was not
  properly awake.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it so wonderful?&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;To tell you the
  truth, I was not sleepy, and I felt like a little walk. You can go back now,
  Bryan,&rdquo; she said, turning to her maid. &ldquo;Mr. Mannering will see me
  home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As though by mutual consent they crossed to the sea- wall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What made you come out again?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;No,
  don&rsquo;t answer me! I think that I know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was going up to my room,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and as I passed
  the landing window which looks into the courtyard I saw you talking to your
  wife. I&mdash;I am afraid that I watched. I saw her leave you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What was it that she gave you? What is it that you have in your
  hand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He opened his fingers. She turned her head away. It seemed to him an
  eternity that she stood there. When she spoke her voice was scarcely more
  than a whisper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lawrence,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we have been very selfish, you
  and I! There have been no words between us, but I think the compact has been
  there all the same. It seemed to me somehow that it was a compensation, that
  it was part of the natural order of things, that as our own folly had kept us
  apart, you should still belong to me&mdash;in my thoughts. And I have no
  right to this, or any share of you, Lawrence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He drew a little nearer to her. She moved instantly away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that our party breaks up
  to-morrow. When we meet again, Lawrence, it must be differently. I am parting
  with a great deal that has been precious to me, but it must be. It is quite
  clear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I made no promise!&rdquo; he cried, hoarsely. &ldquo;I did not
  mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She stopped him with a swift glance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind that. You and I are not of the race of people who shrink
  from their duty, or fear to do what is right. Your wife&rsquo;s face taught
  me mine. Your conscience will tell you yours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know what I mean. We shall meet again, of course, but this is
  none the less our farewell. No, don&rsquo;t touch me! Not even my hand,
  Lawrence. Don&rsquo;t make it any harder. Let us go in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But he did not move. The place where they stood was deserted. From below
  the white spray came leaping up almost to their faces as the waves beat
  against the wall. Behind them the town was black and deserted, save where a
  few lights gleamed out from the hotel. She shivered a little, and drew her
  cloak around her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am getting cold and
  cramped.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He walked by her side to the hotel. At the foot of the steps she left
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We shall meet again in London,&rdquo; she said, quietly.
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too hard upon your old friends when you take your seat.
  Remember that you were once one of us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked round and waved her hand as she disappeared. He caught a
  glimpse of her face as she passed underneath the hanging lamp&mdash;the face
  of a tired woman suddenly grown old. With a little groan he made his way into
  the hotel, and slowly ascended the stairs.</p>

  <p>Early the next morning Mannering left Bonestre, and in twenty-four hours
  he was back again, summoned by a telegram which had met him in London. It
  seemed to him that everybody at the station and about the hotel regarded him
  with shocked and respectful sympathy. Hester, looking like a ghost, took him
  at once to her room. He was haggard and weary with rapid travelling, and he
  sank into a chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me&mdash;the worst!&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She started with Mr. Englehall about mid- day,&rdquo; Hester said.
  &ldquo;They had luggage, but I explained that he was going to Paris, she was
  coming back by train. At two o&rsquo;clock we were rung up on the telephone.
  Their brake had snapped going down the hill by St. Entuiel, and the
  chauffeur&mdash;he is mad now&mdash;but they think he lost his nerve. They
  were dashed into a tree, and&mdash;they were both dead&mdash;when they were
  got out from the wreck.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;God in Heaven!&rdquo; Mannering murmured, white to the lips.</p>

  <p>There was a silence between them. Mannering had covered his head with his
  hands. Hester tried once or twice to speak, but the tears were streaming from
  her eyes. She had the air of having more to say. The white horror of tragedy
  was still in her face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is a letter,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;She left a
  letter for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering rose slowly to his feet and moved to the lamp. Directly he had
  broken the seal he understood. He read the first line and looked up. His eyes
  met Hester&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who knows&mdash;this?&rdquo; he asked, hoarsely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No one! They had not been gone two hours. I explained
  everything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then Mannering read on.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;My dear Husband:</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;I call you that for the last time, for I am going
  off with Englehall to Paris. Don&rsquo;t be too shocked, and don&rsquo;t
  despise me too much. I am just a very ordinary woman, and I&rsquo;m afraid
  I&rsquo;ve bad blood in my veins. Anyhow, I can&rsquo;t go on living under a
  glass case any longer. The old life was rotten enough, but this is
  insupportable. I&rsquo;m going to have a fling, and after that I don&rsquo;t
  care what becomes of me.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Now, Lawrence, I don&rsquo;t want you to blame
  yourself. I did think perhaps that when we were married I might have got you
  to care for me a little, but I suppose that was just my vanity. It
  wasn&rsquo;t very possible with a woman like&mdash;well, never mind
  who&mdash;about. You did your best. You were very nice and very kind to me
  last night, but it wasn&rsquo;t the real thing, was it? I knew you hated
  being where you were. I could almost hear your sigh of relief when I let you
  go. The fact of it is, our marriage was a mistake. I ought to have been
  satisfied with your name, I suppose, and the position it gave me, but
  I&rsquo;m not that sort of woman. I&rsquo;ve been in Bohemia too long. I like
  cheery friends, even if their names are not in Debrett, and I must have some
  one to care for me, or to pretend to care for me. You know I&rsquo;ve cared
  for you&mdash;only you in a certain way&mdash;but I&rsquo;m not heroic enough
  to be content with a shadowy love. I&rsquo;m not an idealist. Imagination
  doesn&rsquo;t content me in the least. I&rsquo;d rather have an inferior
  substance than ideal perfection. You see, I&rsquo;m a very commonplace person
  at heart, Lawrence&mdash;almost vulgar. But these are my last words to you,
  so I&rsquo;ve gone in for plain speaking. Now you&rsquo;re rid of me.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all! From your point of view I suppose,
  and your friends, I&rsquo;ve gone to the devil. Don&rsquo;t be too sure of
  it. I&rsquo;m going to have a good time, and when the end comes I&rsquo;m
  willing to pay. If you are idiotic enough to come after me, I shall be angry
  with you for the first time in my life, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be the least
  bit of use. Englehall&rsquo;s an old friend of mine, and he&rsquo;s a good
  sort. He&rsquo;s wanted me to do this often enough for years, but I never
  felt quite like it. I believe he&rsquo;d marry me after, but he&rsquo;s got a
  wife shut up somewhere.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;I expect you think this a callous sort of letter.
  Well, I can&rsquo;t help it. If it disgusts you with me, so much the better.
  I&rsquo;m sorry for the scandal, but you will get over that. Good-bye,
  Lawrence. Forgive me all the bother I&rsquo;ve been to you.</p>

  <p class="letter">Blanche.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering looked up from the letter, and again his eyes met
  Hester&rsquo;s. The secret was theirs alone. Very carefully he tore the pages
  into small pieces. Then he opened the stove and watched them consumed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No one will ever know,&rdquo; Hester said. &ldquo;She
  said&mdash;when she left&mdash;that it was a morning&rsquo;s ride&mdash;but
  motors were so uncertain that she took a bag.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering&rsquo;s eyes were filled once more with tears. The intolerable
  pity of the whole thing, its awful suddenness swept every other thought out
  of his mind. He remembered how anxiously she had tried to please him on that
  last night. He loathed himself for the cold brutality of his chilly
  affection. Hester came and knelt by his side, but she said nothing. So the
  hours passed.</p>

  <h2><a id="ref-b401"
     name="ref-b401"></a>BOOK IV</h2>

  <h2>I. &mdash; THE PERSISTENCY OF BORROWDEAN</h2>

  <p>&ldquo;And what does Mannering think of it all, I wonder!&rdquo; Lord
  Redford remarked, lighting a fresh cigarette. &ldquo;This may be his
  opportunity, who can tell!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will he have the nerve to grasp it?&rdquo; Borrowdean asked.
  &ldquo;Mannering has never been proved in a crisis.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He may have the nerve. I should be more inclined to question the
  desire,&rdquo; Lord Redford said. &ldquo;For a man in his position he has
  always seemed to me singularly unambitious. I don&rsquo;t think that the
  prospect of being Prime Minister would dazzle him in the least. It is part of
  the genius of the politician too, to know exactly when and how to seize an
  opportunity. I can imagine him watching it come, examining it through his
  eyeglass, and standing on one side with a shrug of the shoulders.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You do not believe, then,&rdquo; Berenice said, &ldquo;that he is
  sufficiently in earnest to grasp it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Lord Redford said. &ldquo;I have that feeling about
  Mannering, I must admit, especially during the last two years. He seems to
  have drawn away from all of us, to live altogether too absorbed and
  self-contained a life for a man who has great ambitions to realize, or who is
  in downright earnest about his work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What you all forget when you discuss Lawrence Mannering is
  this,&rdquo; Berenice said. &ldquo;He holds his position almost as a sacred
  charge. He is absolutely conscientious. He wants certain things for the sake
  of the people, and he will work steadily on until he gets them. I believe it
  is the truth that he has no personal ambition, but if the cause he has at
  heart is to be furthered at all it must be by his taking office. Therefore I
  think that when the time comes he will take it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That sounds reasonable enough,&rdquo; Lord Redford admitted.
  &ldquo;By the bye, did you notice that he is included in the house party at
  Sandringham again this week?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anstruther, the youngest Cabinet Minister, and Lord Redford&rsquo;s
  nephew, joined in the conversation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can tell you something for a fact,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My
  cousin is Lady-in-Waiting, and she&rsquo;s been up in town for a few days,
  and she asked me about Mannering. A Certain Personage thinks very highly of
  him indeed. Told some one that Mr. Mannering was the most statesman- like
  politician in the service of his country. I believe he&rsquo;d sooner see
  Mannering Prime Minister than any one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But he has no following,&rdquo; Borrowdean objected.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Berenice said, slowly, &ldquo;that he keeps as far
  aloof as possible for one reason, and one reason only. He avoids friendship,
  but he makes no enemies. He cultivates a neutral position whenever he can.
  What he is looking forward to, I am sure, is to found a coalition
  Government.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is very possible,&rdquo; Lord Redford remarked. &ldquo;I wonder
  if he will ask me to join.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Always selfish,&rdquo; Berenice laughed. &ldquo;You men are all
  alike!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; Lord Redford answered, &ldquo;my interest
  was purely patriotic. I cannot imagine the affairs of the country flourishing
  deprived of my valuable services. Let us go and wander through the crowd.
  Members of a Government in extremes like ours ought not to whisper together
  in corners. It gives rise to comment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anstruther came hurrying up. He drew Redford on one side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mannering is here,&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;Just arrived
  from Sandringham. He is looking for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Almost as he spoke Mannering appeared. He did not at first see Berenice,
  and from the corner where she stood she watched him closely.</p>

  <p>It was two years since those few weeks at Bonestre, and during all that
  time they had scarcely met. Berenice knew that he had avoided her. For twelve
  months he had declined all social engagements, and since then he had pleaded
  the stress of political affairs as an excuse for leading the life almost of a
  recluse. Unseen herself, she studied him closely. He was much thinner, and
  every trace of his once healthy colouring had disappeared. His eyes seemed
  deeper set. There were streaks of grey in his hair. But for all that to her
  he was unaltered. He was still the one man in the world. She saw him shake
  hands with Lord Redford and draw him a little on one side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can you spare me five minutes?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I have a
  matter to discuss with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; Lord Redford answered. &ldquo;I am leaving
  directly, and I might drive you home if you liked. We heard that you were at
  Sandringham.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I came up this afternoon,&rdquo; Mannering answered. &ldquo;I heard
  that you were likely to be here, and as Lady Herrington had been kind enough
  to send me a card I came on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lord Redford nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Borrowdean and Anstruther are here too,&rdquo; he remarked.
  &ldquo;We all felt in need of diversion. As you know very well, we&rsquo;re
  in a tight corner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice came out from her place. At the sound of the rustling of her
  skirts both men turned their heads. She wore a gown of black velvet and a
  wonderful rope of pearls hung from her neck. She raised her hand and smiled
  at Mannering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you again,&rdquo; she said, softly. &ldquo;It is
  quite an age since we met, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He held her hand for a moment. The touch of his fingers chilled her. He
  greeted her with quiet courtesy, but there was no answering smile upon his
  lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have heard often of your movements from Clara,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;You have been very kind to her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It has never occurred to me in that light,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;Clara needs a chaperon, and I need a companion. We were talking
  yesterday of going to Cairo for the winter. My only fear is that I am robbing
  you of your niece.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please do not let that trouble you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Clara
  would be a most uncomfortable member of my household.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But are you never at all lonely?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never have time to think of such a thing,&rdquo; he answered.
  &ldquo;Besides, I have Hester. She makes a wonderful secretary, and she seems
  to enjoy the work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should like to have a talk with you some time,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come and see me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is very kind of you to ask me,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think me churlish, but I go nowhere. I am trying to make
  up, you see, for my years of idleness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at him steadfastly, and her heart sank. The change in his
  outward appearance seemed typical of some deeper and more final alteration in
  his whole nature. She felt herself powerless against the absolute
  impenetrability of his tone and manner. She felt that he had fought a battle
  within himself and conquered; that for some reason or other he had decided to
  walk no longer in the pleasanter paths of life. She had come to him
  unexpectedly, but he had shown no sign of emotion. Her influence over him
  seemed to be wholly a thing of the past. She made one more effort.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that as one grows older one parts
  the less readily with the few friends who count. I hope that you will change
  your mind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He bowed gravely, but he made no answer. Berenice took Borrowdean&rsquo;s
  arm and passed on. There was a little spot of colour in her cheeks.
  Borrowdean felt nerved to his enterprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us go somewhere and sit down for a few minutes,&rdquo; he
  suggested. &ldquo;The rooms are so hot this evening.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She assented without words, and he found a solitary couch in one of the
  further apartments.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said, after a moment&rsquo;s pause,
  &ldquo;whether I might say something to you, whether you would listen to me
  for a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice was absorbed in her own thoughts. She allowed him to proceed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For a good many years,&rdquo; he said, lowering his voice a little,
  &ldquo;I have worked hard and done all I could to be successful. I wanted to
  have some sort of a position to offer. I am a Cabinet Minister now, and
  although I don&rsquo;t suppose we can last much longer this time, I shall
  have a place whenever we are in again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The sense of what he was saying began to dawn upon her. She stopped him at
  once.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please do not say any more, Sir Leslie,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;I
  should have given you credit for sufficient perception to have known
  beforehand the absolute impossibility of&mdash;of anything of the
  sort.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are still a young woman,&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;The
  world expects you to marry again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no interest in what the world expects of me,&rdquo; she
  answered, &ldquo;but I may tell you at once that my refusal has nothing
  whatever to do with the question of marriage in the abstract. You are a man
  of perception, Sir Leslie! It will be, I trust, sufficient if I say that I
  have no feelings whatever towards you which would induce me to consider the
  subject even for a moment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was unchanged, then! This time he recognized the note of finality in
  her tone. All the time and thought he had given to this matter were wasted.
  He had failed, and he knew why. He seldom permitted himself the luxury of
  anger, but he felt all the poison of bitter hatred stirring within him at
  that moment, and craving for some sort of expression. There was nothing he
  could do, nothing he could say. But if Mannering had been within reach then
  he would have struck him. He rose and walked slowly away.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b402"
     name="ref-b402"></a>II. HESTER THINKS IT &ldquo;A GREAT PITY&rdquo;</h2>

  <p>&ldquo;You will understand,&rdquo; Mannering said, as the brougham drove
  off, &ldquo;that you and I are speaking together merely as friends. I have
  nothing official to say to you. It would be presumption on my part to assume
  that the time is ripe for anything definite while you are still at the head
  of an unbeaten Government. But one learns to read the signs of the times. I
  think that you and I both know that you cannot last the session.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a positive luxury at times,&rdquo; Redford answered,
  &ldquo;to be able to indulge in absolute candour. We cannot last the session.
  You pulled us through our last tight corner, but we shall part, I suppose, on
  the New Tenement Bill, and then we shall come a cropper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Opposition,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are not strong enough to
  form a Government alone. And I do not think that a one-man Cabinet would be
  popular. It has been suggested to me that at no time in political history
  have the conditions been more favourable for a really strong coalition
  Government, containing men of moderate views on both sides. I am anxious to
  know whether you would be willing to join such a combination.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Under whom?&rdquo; Lord Redford asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Under myself,&rdquo; Mannering answered, gravely.
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think me over-presumptuous. The matter has been very
  carefully thought out. You could not serve under Rushleigh, nor could he
  serve under you. But you could both be invaluable members of a Cabinet of
  which I was the nominal head. I do not wish to entrap you into consent,
  however, without your fully understanding this: a modified, and to a certain
  extent an experimental, scheme of tariff reform would be part of our
  programme.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You wish for a reply,&rdquo; Lord Redford said, &ldquo;only in
  general terms?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only in general terms, of course,&rdquo; Mannering assented.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you may take it,&rdquo; Lord Redford said, &ldquo;that I
  should be proud to become a member of such a Government. Anything would be
  better than a fourth-party administration with Imperialism on the brain and
  rank Protection on their programme. They might do mischief which it would
  take centuries to undo.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We understand one another, Lord Redford,&rdquo; Mannering said,
  simply. &ldquo;I am very much obliged to you. This is my turning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering, when he found himself alone in his study, drew a little sigh of
  relief. He flung himself into an easy-chair, and sat with his hands pressed
  against his temples. The events of the day, from the morning at Sandringham
  to his recent conversation with Lord Redford, were certainly of sufficiently
  exciting a nature to provide him with food for thought. And yet his mind was
  full of one thing only, this chance meeting with Berenice. It was wonderful
  to him that she should have changed so little. He himself felt that the last
  two years were equal to a decade, that events on the other side of that line
  with which his life was riven were events with which some other person was
  concerned, certainly not the Lawrence Mannering of to-day. And yet he knew
  now that the battle which he had fought was far from a final one. Her power
  over him was unchanged. He was face to face once more with the old problem.
  His life was sworn to the service of the people. He had crowded his days with
  thoughts and deeds and plans for them. Almost every personal luxury and
  pleasure had been abnegated. He had found a sort of fierce delight in the
  asceticism of his daily life, in the unflinching firmness with which he had
  barred the gates which might lead him into smoother and happier ways.
  To-night he was beset with a sudden fear. He rose and looked at himself in
  the glass. He was pale and wan. His face lacked the robust vitality of a few
  years ago. He was ageing fast. He was conscious of certain disquieting
  symptoms in the routine of his daily life. He threw himself back into the
  chair with a little groan. The mockery of his life of ceaseless toil seemed
  suddenly to spread itself out before him, a grim and unlovely jest. What if
  his strength should go? What if all this labour and self-denial should be in
  vain? He found himself growing giddy at the thought.</p>

  <p>He rang the bell and ordered wine. Then he went to the telephone and rang
  up a doctor who lived near. Very soon, with coat and waistcoat off, he was
  going through a somewhat prolonged examination. Afterwards the doctor sat
  down opposite to him and accepted a cigar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What made you send for me this evening?&rdquo; he asked,
  curiously.</p>

  <p>Mannering hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An impulse,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To-morrrow I should have no time
  to come to you. I wasn&rsquo;t feeling quite myself, and it is possible that
  I may be undertaking some very important work before long.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t if I were you,&rdquo; the doctor remarked,
  quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The work is of such a nature,&rdquo; Mannering said, &ldquo;that I
  could not refuse it. It may not come, but if it does I must go through with
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I doubt whether you will succeed,&rdquo; the doctor said.
  &ldquo;There is nothing the matter with you except that you have been drawing
  on your reserve stock of strength to such an extent that you are on the verge
  of a collapse. The longer you stave it off the more complete it will
  be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are a Job&rsquo;s comforter,&rdquo; Mannering remarked, with a
  smile. &ldquo;Send me some physic, and I will take things as easy as I
  can.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you some,&rdquo; the doctor answered, &ldquo;but it
  won&rsquo;t do you much good. What you want is rest and amusement.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering laughed, and showed him out. When he returned to his study
  Hester was there, just returned from a visit to the theatre with some
  friends. She threw off her wrap and looked through the letters which had come
  by the evening&rsquo;s post.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you see this from Richard Fardell?&rdquo; she asked him.
  &ldquo;Parkins is dead at last. Fardell says that he has been quite childish
  for the last eighteen months! Are you ill?&rdquo; she broke off,
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>Mannering, who was lying back in his easy-chair, white almost to the lips,
  roused himself with an effort. He poured out a glass of wine and drank it
  off.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ill,&rdquo; he said, with rather a weak smile,
  &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m a little tired.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who was your visitor?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A doctor. I felt a little run down, so I sent for him. Of course he
  told me the usual story. Rest and a holiday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She came and sat on the arm of his chair. Every year she grew less and
  less like her mother. Her hair was smoothly brushed back from her forehead,
  and her features were distinctly intellectual. She was by far the best
  secretary Mannering had ever had.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You need some one to look after you,&rdquo; she said,
  decisively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It seems to me that you do that pretty well,&rdquo; he answered.
  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any one else.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You need some one with more authority than I have,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;You ought to marry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Marry!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Any particular person?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course! You know whom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering did not reply at once. He was looking steadfastly into the fire,
  and the gloom in his face was unlightened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hester,&rdquo; he said, at last, in a very low tone, &ldquo;I will
  tell you, if you like, a short, a very short chapter of my life. It lasted a
  few hours, a day or so, more or less. Yet of course it has made a difference
  always.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should like to hear it,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The two great events of my life,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;came
  together. I was engaged to be married to the Duchess of Lenchester at the
  same time that I found myself forced to sever my connexion with the Liberal
  party. You know, of course, that the Duchess has always been a great figure
  in politics. She has ambitions, and her political creed is almost a part of
  the religion of her life. She looked upon my apostasy with horror. It came
  between us at the very moment when I thought that I had found in life the one
  great and beautiful thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If ever she let it come between you,&rdquo; Hester interrupted,
  softly, &ldquo;I believe that she has repented. We women are quick to find
  out those things, you know,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;and I am sure that I am
  right. She has never married any one else. I do not believe that she ever
  will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is too late,&rdquo; Mannering said. &ldquo;A union between us
  now could only lead to unhappiness. The disintegration of parties is slowly
  commencing, and I think that the next few years will find me still further
  apart than I am to-day from my old friends. Berenice&rdquo;&mdash;he slipped
  so easily into calling her so&mdash;&ldquo;is heart and soul with
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; Hester said, &ldquo;I think that for both your
  sakes you should give her the opportunity of choosing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Even that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;would not be wise. We are man and
  woman still, you see, Hester, and there are moments when sentiment is strong
  enough to triumph over principle and sweep our minds bare of all the
  every-day thoughts. But afterwards&mdash;there is always the afterwards. The
  conflict must come. Reason stays with us always, and sentiment might weaken
  with the years.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Duchess is a woman,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and the hold of all
  other things grows weak when she loves. Give her the chance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Mannering exclaimed, almost sharply. &ldquo;You
  can&rsquo;t see this matter as I do. I have vowed my life now. I have seen my
  duty, and I have kept my face turned steadily towards it. Once I was
  contented with very different things, and I think that I came as near
  happiness then as a man often does. But those days have gone by. They have
  left a whole world of delightful memories, but I have locked the doors of the
  past behind me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hester shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are making a mistake,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Two people who
  love one another, and who are honest in their opinions, find happiness sooner
  or later if they have the courage to seek for it. Don&rsquo;t you
  know,&rdquo; she continued, after a moment&rsquo;s pause,
  &ldquo;that&mdash;she understood? I always like to think what I believe to be
  the truth. She went away to leave you free.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering rose to his feet and pointed to the clock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is time that you and I were in bed, Hester,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;Remember that we have a busy morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It seems a pity,&rdquo; she murmured, as she wished him good-night.
  &ldquo;A great pity!&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a id="ref-b403"
     name="ref-b403"></a>I. &mdash; SUMMONED TO WINDSOR</h2>

  <p>Berenice, who had just returned from making a call, was standing in the
  hall, glancing through the cards displayed upon a small round table. The
  major- domo of her household came hurrying out from his office.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is a young lady, your Grace,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;who
  has been waiting to see you for half an hour. Her name is Miss
  Phillimore.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; Berenice asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In the library, your Grace.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Show her into my own room,&rdquo; Berenice said, &ldquo;I will see
  her at once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hester was a little nervous, but Berenice set her immediately at her ease
  by the graciousness of her manner. They talked for some time of Bonestre.
  Then there was a moment&rsquo;s pause. Hester summoned up her courage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you may consider what I
  am going to say rather a liberty. I&rsquo;ve thought it all out, and I
  decided to come to you. I couldn&rsquo;t see any other way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice smiled encouragingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will promise you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I will consider it
  nothing of the sort.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is very kind of you,&rdquo; Hester said. &ldquo;I have come
  here because Mr. Mannering is the greatest friend I have in the world. He
  stands to me for all the relatives most girls have, and I am very fond of him
  indeed. I scarcely remember my father, but Mr. Mannering was always kind to
  me when I was a child. You know, perhaps, that I am living with him now as
  his secretary?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice nodded pleasantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see him every day,&rdquo; Hester continued, &ldquo;and I notice
  things. He has changed a great deal during the last few years. I am getting
  very anxious about him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is not ill, I hope?&rdquo; Berenice asked. &ldquo;I too noticed
  a change. It grieved me very much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is simply working himself to death,&rdquo; Hester continued,
  &ldquo;without relaxation or pleasure of any sort. And all the time he is
  unhappy. Other men, however hard they work, have their hobbies and their
  occasional holidays. He has neither. And I think that I know why. He fights
  all the time to forget.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To forget what?&rdquo; Berenice asked, slowly turning her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To forget how near he came once to being very happy,&rdquo; Hester
  answered, boldly. &ldquo;To forget&mdash;you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then her heart sang a little song of triumph, for she saw the instant
  change in the still, cold face turned now a little away from her. She saw the
  proud lips tremble and the unmistakable light leap out from the dark eyes.
  She saw the colour rush into the cheeks, and she had no more fear. She rose
  from her chair and dropped on one knee by Berenice&rsquo;s side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Make him happy, please,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;You can do it.
  You only! He loves you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice smiled, although her eyes were wet with tears. She laid her long,
  delicate fingers upon the other&rsquo;s hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, my dear child,&rdquo; she protested, &ldquo;what can I do? Mr.
  Mannering won&rsquo;t come near me. He won&rsquo;t even write to me. I
  can&rsquo;t take him by storm, can I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is so foolish,&rdquo; Hester said, also smiling. &ldquo;He will
  not understand how unimportant all other things are when two people care for
  one another. He talks about the difference in your politics, as though that
  were sufficient to keep you apart!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice was silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There was a time,&rdquo; she said, softly, &ldquo;when I thought
  so, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; Hester declared. &ldquo;And he doesn&rsquo;t know,
  of course, that you don&rsquo;t think so now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice smiled slightly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must remember, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that Mr. Mannering
  and I are in rather a peculiar position. My great- grandfather, my father and
  my uncle were all Prime Ministers of England, and they were all staunch
  Liberals. My family has always taken its politics very seriously indeed, and
  so have I. It is not a little thing, this, after all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you will do it!&rdquo; Hester exclaimed. &ldquo;I am sure that
  you will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice rose to her feet. A sense of excitement was suddenly quivering in
  her veins, her heart was beating fiercely. After all, this child was wise.
  She had been drifting into the dull, passionless life of a middle-aged woman.
  All the joys of youth seemed suddenly to be sweeping up from her heart,
  mocking the serenity of her days, these stagnant days, sheltered from the
  great winds of life, where the waves were ripples and the hours changeless.
  She raised her arms for a moment and dropped them to her side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I do not know!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It is such an upheaval.
  If he were here&mdash;if he asked me himself. But he will never come
  now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe that he would come to-morrow,&rdquo; Hester said,
  &ldquo;if he were sure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice laughed softly. There was colour in her cheeks as she turned to
  Hester.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell him to come and have tea with me to-morrow afternoon,&rdquo;
  she said. &ldquo;I shall be quite alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hester felt all her confidence slipping away from her. The echoes of her
  breathless, passionate words had scarcely died away, and Mannering, to all
  appearance, was unmoved. His still, cold face showed no signs of agitation,
  his dark, beringed eyes were full of nothing but an intense weariness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do I understand, Hester,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that you have been
  to see the Duchess?&mdash;that you have spoken of these things to
  her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her heart sank. His tone was almost censorious. Nevertheless, she stood
  her ground.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes! I have told you the truth. And I am glad that I went. You are
  very clever people, both of you, but you are spoiling your lives for the sake
  of a little common sense. It was necessary for some one to
  interfere.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering shook his head slowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You meant kindly, Hester,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it was a
  mistake. The time when that might have been possible has gone by. Neither she
  nor I can call back the hand of time. The last two years have made an old man
  of me. I have no longer my enthusiasm. I am in the whirlpool, and I must
  fight my way through to the end.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She sat at his feet. He was still in the easy-chair into which he had sunk
  on his first coming into the room. He had been speaking in the House late,
  amidst all the excitement of a political crisis.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why fight alone,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;when she is willing to
  come to you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There would be conditions,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and she would not
  understand. I may be in office in a month with most of her friends in
  opposition. The situation would be impossible!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; Hester declared. &ldquo;The Duchess is too great a
  woman to lose so utterly her sense of proportion. Don&rsquo;t you
  understand&mdash;that she loves you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering laughed bitterly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She must love a shadow, then!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for the man
  she knew does not exist any longer. Poor little girl, are you
  disappointed?&rdquo; he added, more kindly. &ldquo;I am sorry!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am disappointed to hear you talking like this,&rdquo; she
  declared. &ldquo;I will not believe that it is more than a mood. You are
  overtired, perhaps!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I have been overtired for a long
  time. The strength the gods give us lasts a weary while. You must send my
  excuses to the Duchess, Hester. The fates are leading me another
  way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;You shall be
  reasonable! I will make you go!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you could,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;you might alter the
  writing on one little page of history. We defeated the Government to-night
  badly, and I am going to Windsor to-morrow afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hester rose to her feet and paced the room restlessly. Mannering had
  spoken without exultation. His pallid face seemed to her to have grown thin
  and hard. He saw himself the possible Prime Minister of the morrow without
  the slightest suggestion of any sort of gratified ambition.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether to say that I am glad or not,&rdquo;
  Hester declared, stopping once more by his side. &ldquo;If you are going to
  shut yourself off from everything else in life which makes for happiness, to
  forget that you are a man, and turn yourself into a law-making machine, well,
  then, I am sorry. I think that your success will be a curse to you. I think
  that you will live to regret it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering looked at her for a moment with a gleam of his old self shining
  out of his eyes. A sudden pathos, a wave of self-pity had softened his
  face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear child!&rdquo; he said, gravely, &ldquo;I cannot make you
  understand. I carry a burden from which no one can free me. For good or for
  evil the powers that be have set my feet in the path of the climbers, and for
  the sake of those whose sufferings I have seen I must struggle upwards to the
  end. Berenice and the Duchess of Lenchester are two very different persons. I
  cannot take one into my life without the other. It is because I love her,
  Hester, that I let her go. Good-night, child!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She kissed his hand and went slowly to her room, stumbling upstairs
  through a mist of tears. There was nothing more that she could do.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b404"
     name="ref-b404"></a>IV. &mdash; CHECKMATE TO BORROWDEAN</h2>

  <p>Mannering&rsquo;s town house, none too large at any time, was transformed
  into a little hive of industry. Two hurriedly appointed secretaries were at
  work in the dining-room, and Hester was busy typing in her own little
  sanctum.</p>

  <p>Mannering sat in his study before a table covered with papers, and for the
  first time during the day was alone for a few moments.</p>

  <p>His servant brought in a card. Mannering glanced at it and frowned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The gentleman said that he would not keep you for more than a
  moment, sir,&rdquo; the servant announced quietly, mindful of the
  half-sovereign which had been slipped into his hand.</p>

  <p>Mannering still looked at the card doubtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can show him up,&rdquo; he said at last.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very good, sir!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man withdrew, and reappeared to usher in Sir Leslie Borrowdean.
  Mannering greeted him without offering his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You wished to see me, Sir Leslie?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>Borrowdean came slowly into the room. He closed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you will not consider my
  presence an intrusion!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have business with me, I presume,&rdquo; Mannering answered,
  coldly. &ldquo;Pray sit down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean ignored the chair, towards which Mannering had motioned. He
  came and stood by the side of the table.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unless your memory, Mannering,&rdquo; he said, with a hard little
  laugh, &ldquo;is as short as the proverbial politician&rsquo;s, you can
  scarcely be surprised at my visit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering raised his eyebrows, and said nothing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must confess,&rdquo; Borrowdean continued, &ldquo;that I scarcely
  expected to find it necessary for me to come here and remind you that it was
  I who am responsible for your reappearance in politics.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not likely,&rdquo; Mannering said, slowly, &ldquo;to forget
  your good offices in that respect.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I felt sure that you would not,&rdquo; Borrowdean answered.
  &ldquo;Yet you must not altogether blame me for my coming! I understand that
  the list of your proposed Cabinet is to be completed to- morrow afternoon,
  and as yet I have heard nothing from you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your information,&rdquo; Mannering said, &ldquo;is quite correct.
  In fact, my list is complete already. If your visit here is one of curiosity,
  I have no objection to gratify it. Here is a list of the names I have
  selected.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He handed a sheet of paper to Borrowdean, who glanced it eagerly down.
  Afterwards he looked up and met Mannering&rsquo;s calm gaze. There was an
  absolute silence for several seconds.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My name,&rdquo; Borrowdean said, hoarsely, &ldquo;is not amongst
  these!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It really never occurred to me for a single second to place it
  there,&rdquo; Mannering answered.</p>

  <p>Borrowdean drew a little breath. He was deathly pale.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You include Redford,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He is a more violent
  partizan than I have ever been. I have heard you say a dozen times that you
  disapprove of turning a man out of office directly he has got into the swing
  of it. Has any one any fault to find with me? I have done my duty, and done
  it thoroughly. I don&rsquo;t know what your programme may be, but if Redford
  can accept it I am sure that I can.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; Mannering answered. &ldquo;I have this
  peculiarity, though. Call it a whim, if you like. I desire to see my Cabinet
  composed of honourable men.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean started back as though he had received a blow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am I to accept that as a statement of your opinion of me?&rdquo; he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It seems fairly obvious,&rdquo; Mannering answered, &ldquo;that
  such was my intention.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You owe your place in public life to me,&rdquo; Borrowdean
  exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I do,&rdquo; Mannering answered, &ldquo;do you imagine that I
  consider myself your debtor? I tell you that to-day, at this moment, I have
  no political ambitions. Before you appeared at Blakely and commenced your
  underhand scheming, I was a contented, almost a happy man. You imagined that
  my reappearance in political life would be beneficial to you, and with that
  in view, and that only, you set yourself to get me back. You succeeded! We
  won&rsquo;t say how! If you are disappointed with the result what concern is
  that of mine? You have called yourself my friend. I have not for some time
  considered you as such. I owe you nothing. I have no feeling for you save one
  of contempt. To me you figure as the modern political adventurer, living on
  his wits and the credulity of other people. Better see how it will pay you in
  opposition.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean, a cold-blooded and calculating man, knew for the first time in
  his life what it was to let his passions govern him. Every word which this
  man had spoken was truth, and therefore all the more bitter to hear. He saw
  himself beaten and humiliated, outwitted by the man whom he had sought to
  make his tool. A slow paroxysm of anger held him rigid. He was white to the
  lips. His nerves and senses were all tingling. There was red fire before his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If your business with me is ended,&rdquo; Mannering said, waving
  his hand towards the door, &ldquo;you will forgive me if I remind you that I
  am much occupied.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean snatched up the square glass paper cutter from the table, and
  without a second&rsquo;s warning he struck Mannering with it full upon the
  temple.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>Mannering tried to struggle to his feet, but collapsed, and fell upon the
  floor. Borrowdean kicked his prostrate body.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now go and form your Cabinet,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;May you
  wake in hell!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Borrowdean, who left the study a madman, was a sane person the moment he
  began to descend the stairs and found himself face to face with a tall,
  heavily cloaked woman. The flash of familiar jewels in her hair, something,
  perhaps, in the quiet stateliness of her movements, betrayed her identity to
  him. His heart gave a quick jump. A sickening fear stole over him. He barred
  the way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Duchess!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>She waved him aside with an impatient gesture. He could see the frown
  gathering upon her face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir Leslie!&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Please let me pass! I want
  to see Mr. Mannering before any one else goes up!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir Leslie drew immediately to one side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pray do not let me detain you,&rdquo; he said, coolly.
  &ldquo;Between ourselves, I do not think that Mannering is in a fit state to
  see anybody. I have not been able to get a coherent word out of him. He walks
  all the time backwards and forwards like a man demented.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice smiled slightly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are annoyed,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;because you will be in
  opposition once more!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I go into opposition again,&rdquo; Borrowdean answered,
  &ldquo;it will be my own choice. Mannering has asked me to join his
  Cabinet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Berenice raised her eyebrows. Her surprise was genuine.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You amaze me!&rdquo; she declared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was amazed myself,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

  <p>She passed on her way, and Borrowdean descending, took a cab quietly home.
  Berenice, with her hand upon the door, hesitated. Hester had purposely sent
  her up alone. They had waited until they had heard Borrowdean leave the room.
  And now at the last moment she hesitated. She was a proud woman. She was
  departing now, for his sake, from the conventions of a lifetime. He had
  declined to come to her; no matter, she had come to him instead.
  Suppose&mdash;he should not be glad? Suppose she should fail to see in his
  face her justification? It was very quiet in the room. She could not even
  hear the scratching of his pen. Twice her fingers closed upon the knob of the
  door, and twice she hesitated. If it had not been for facing Hester below she
  would probably have gone silently away.</p>

  <p>And then&mdash;she heard a sound. It was not at all the sort of sound for
  which she had been listening, but it brought her hesitation to a sudden end.
  She threw open the door, and a little cry of amazement broke from her
  trembling lips. It was indeed a groan which she had heard. Mannering was
  stretched upon the floor, his eyes half closed, his face ghastly white. For a
  moment she stood motionless, a whole torrent of arrested speech upon her
  quivering lips. Then she dropped on her knees by his side and lifted his cold
  hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, my love!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;My love!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But he made no sign. Then she stood up, and her cry of horror rang through
  the house.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ref-b405"
     name="ref-b405"></a>V. &mdash; A BRAZEN PROCEEDING</h2>

  <p>Mannering opened his eyes lazily. His companion had stopped suddenly in
  his reading. He appeared to be examining a certain paragraph in the paper
  with much interest. Mannering stretched out his hand for a match, and relit
  his cigarette.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Read it out, Richard,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The young man started slightly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am very sorry, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought that you
  were asleep!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What about the paragraph?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is just this,&rdquo; Richard answered, reading.
  &ldquo;&lsquo;The Duchess of Lenchester and Miss Clara Mannering have arrived
  at Claridge&rsquo;s from the South of Italy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering looked at him keenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am curious to know which part of that announcement you find so
  interesting,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not the latter part, sir,&rdquo; the young man answered.
  &ldquo;I thought perhaps you would have noticed&mdash;I meant to speak to you
  as soon as you were a little stronger&mdash;I have asked Hester to be my
  wife!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then all I can say,&rdquo; Mannering declared, gravely, &ldquo;is,
  that you are a remarkably sensible young man. I am quite strong enough to
  bear a shock of that sort.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to hear you say so, sir,&rdquo; Richard said.
  &ldquo;Of course I shouldn&rsquo;t think of taking her away until you were
  quite yourself again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The cheek of the young man!&rdquo; Mannering murmured. &ldquo;She
  wouldn&rsquo;t go!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she would,&rdquo; Richard laughed. &ldquo;Of
  course we consider that you are very nearly well now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can consider what you like,&rdquo; Mannering answered,
  &ldquo;but I shall remain an invalid as long as it pleases me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hester appeared on the upper lawn, and Richard rose up at once.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think that I
  should like to go and tell Hester that I have spoken to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mannering nodded. He watched the two young people stroll off together
  towards the rose-garden, talking earnestly. He heard the little iron gate
  open and close. He watched them disappear behind the hedge of laurels. A puff
  of breeze brought the faint odour of roses to him, and with it a sudden host
  of memories. His eyes grew wistful. He felt something tugging at his
  heartstrings. Only a few years ago life here had seemed so wonderful a
  thing&mdash;only a few years, but with all the passions and struggles of a
  lifetime crowded into them. The maelstrom was there still, but he himself had
  crept out of it. What was there left? Peace, haunted with memories, rest,
  troubled by desire. He heard the sound of their voices in the rose-garden,
  and he turned away with a pain in his heart of which he was ashamed. These
  things were for the young! If youth had passed him by, still there were
  compensations!</p>

  <p>Compensations, aye&mdash;but he wanted none of them! He picked up the
  newspaper, and with a little difficulty, for his sight was not yet good,
  found a certain paragraph. Then the paper slipped again from his fingers, and
  he heard the sweeping of a woman&rsquo;s dress across the smooth- shaven
  lawn. He gripped the sides of his chair and set his teeth hard. He struggled
  to rise, but she moved swiftly up to him with a gesture of remonstrance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t move,&rdquo; she exclaimed, as though her coming
  were the most natural thing in the world. &ldquo;I am going to sit down with
  you, if I may!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He murmured an expression of conventional delight. She wore a dress of
  some soft white material, and her figure was as wonderful as ever. He
  recovered himself almost at once and studied her admiringly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Paris?&rdquo; he murmured.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Paquin!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I remembered that you liked me
  in white.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But where on earth have you come from?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Farm,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take it
  for three months&mdash;if you&rsquo;re decent to me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That rascal Richard!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Never told me a
  word! Pretended to be surprised when he heard you and Clara were
  back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Clara is going to marry that Frenchman next month,&rdquo; she said,
  &ldquo;and I shall be looking for another companion. Do you know of
  one?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t another niece,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Even if you had,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have come to the
  conclusion that I want something different. Will you listen to me patiently
  for a moment?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you marry me, please?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t
  interrupt. I want there to be no misunderstandings this time. I don&rsquo;t
  care whether you are an invalid or not. I don&rsquo;t care whether you are
  going back into politics or not. I don&rsquo;t care whether we live here or
  in any other corner of the world. You can call yourself anything, from an
  anarchist to a Tory&mdash;or be anything. You can have all your workingmen
  here to dinner in flannel shirts, if you like, and I&rsquo;ll play bowls with
  their wives on the lawn. Nothing matters but this one thing, Lawrence. Will
  you marry me&mdash;and try to care a little?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is absolutely,&rdquo; Mannering declared, taking her into his
  arms, &ldquo;the most brazen proceeding!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good deal better than the bungle we made of it
  before,&rdquo; she murmured.<</p>
