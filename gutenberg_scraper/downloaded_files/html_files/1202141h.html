<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>Mr. Paul Schlesser, number-one cashier to the banking firm of Leopold
Benjamin &amp; Co., Ludenstrasse, Vienna, broke off in his conversation with
the distinguished-looking young Englishman who was leaning over his portion of
the counter and, in an undertone, directed the latter's attention to the taller
of the two men who were issuing from the private office the other side of the
marble tiled floor.</p>
<p>"That," he announced with bated breath and a note of deep respect in his
tone, "is the present head of our firm&mdash;Mr. Leopold Benjamin. He comes
here very seldom nowadays. It is a great pleasure for us to welcome him."</p>
<p>Mr. Schlesser, who was an insignificant-looking person, seemed to expand and
grow almost into dignity as he bowed low to the tall, thin man who was passing
by. Mr. Leopold Benjamin did not in the least resemble his cashier. No one
would have imagined them to belong to the same race, a race which in those days
stood in hourly peril of its life. His smile was scarcely cheerful, but
pleasant enough in its way as he half paused to return his employee's greeting.
His eyes looked enquiringly at the stranger. The cashier slipped open the wire
partition which separated him from the outside world.</p>
<p>"If you will pardon me, Mr. Benjamin," he said, "this gentleman, Mr. Charles
Mildenhall, has a Letter of Credit here from Barclay's in London. This is the
head of our firm, Mr. Mildenhall&mdash;Mr. Leopold Benjamin."</p>
<p>The banker let his fingers slip from his companion's shoulder. He held out
his hand. His voice was pleasant, almost musical.</p>
<p>"You are perhaps related to my old friend&mdash;Sir Phillip Mildenhall?" he
asked.</p>
<p>"Sir Philip is my uncle, sir," the young man replied. "He was First
Secretary here in his younger days."</p>
<p>Mr. Benjamin nodded reminiscently.</p>
<p>"He was a delightful companion. He dined with me often. A connoisseur, too,
of pictures&mdash;in fact, of all <i>objects d'art</i>, I missed him very much
when he went to Bucharest."</p>
<p>"I think in a way he was sorry to go," Mildenhall remarked. "He had many
friends here. Amongst them I have heard him speak of you, sir. I heard from him
of your marvellous collection of Old Masters."</p>
<p>"You are in the Diplomatic Service yourself?" the banker asked.</p>
<p>"In a way I am," the young man answered. "Just now I am on long leave."</p>
<p>"Your uncle is well, I trust?"</p>
<p>"In excellent health, I thank you, sir. I shall tell him of our
meeting."</p>
<p>"You must come and see me before you leave the city," the banker invited.
"How long do you stay here?"</p>
<p>"Only a few days longer, I fear."</p>
<p>"Will you dine with me on Thursday night?" the other suggested. "I am
compelled to choose an early date because my movements are a little
uncertain."</p>
<p>"I will do so with pleasure," the young man assented. "It will interest my
uncle very much to have news of you."</p>
<p>Mr. Benjamin shrugged his high, stooping shoulders. There was a momentary
look of sadness in his sunken eyes.</p>
<p>"Not too good news, I am afraid," he said. "Our race becomes less and less
popular in this country as the days go by. Things were different in your
uncle's time. At present we find the future full of anxiety. One pleasure at
least I shall make sure of," he concluded with a smile. "I shall have the
pleasure of seeing you on Thursday at eight o'clock. I trust that you do not
mind our early hours."</p>
<p>"Not in the least, sir."</p>
<p>"Our friend here at the desk," Leopold Benjamin said, with a benevolent
smile towards the cashier, "will write down my address for you. <i>Auf
Wiedersehen</i>, Mr. Mildenhall."</p>
<p>He passed on, his companion&mdash;a short, thick-set man with a very
intelligent face&mdash;by his side. The cashier looked at his client with
increased respect.</p>
<p>"We regard it as a great honour," he confided as he counted out some notes,
"to be received by Mr. Benjamin. He entertains very little now. Your money,
sir&mdash;also your Letter of Credit," he went on, returning the latter to its
parchment envelope. "It will always be a pleasure to serve you here when you
are in need of more money or if there is any general information about the city
we can give you. I am writing here the address of Mr. Benjamin: Palais Franz
Josef. Any vehicle you engage would drive you there without hesitation."</p>
<p>The young man gathered up his belongings, nodded in friendly fashion and
took his leave. On the broad steps of the very handsome bank building he
hesitated for a few moments, then decided to walk for a while in the
Ringstrasse. It was barely five o'clock and, notwithstanding that these were
days of strain and anxiety, something of the spirit of levity was visible on
the countenances of most of the passers-by. The day's work was over. The
evening and night were at hand. The true Viennese is seldom sensitive to the
call of domesticity. It is the music of the caf&eacute;s, the light laughter of
the women, the flavour of his <i>ap&eacute;ritif</i> which appeal to him with
the coming of the twilight. Mildenhall yielded to the general spirit. After an
hour's promenade he entered one of the most attractive of the famous
caf&eacute;s, purchased an evening paper and installed himself at a comfortable
table. He ordered a drink and lit a cigarette. His Thursday evening rendezvous
pleased him. It was a great thing to have met Leopold Benjamin so entirely by
accident and to have received so interesting an invitation. The Viennese
caf&eacute;s are not made for isolation. Mildenhall was seated in the corner
place of the long settee which stretched down one side of the room. The table
in front of him was sufficiently large to accommodate several customers. There
were two chairs unoccupied. Mildenhall shook out his newspaper and turned it so
that he could read the leading article. His attention, however, was suddenly
distracted.</p>
<p>"I do not disturb you, sir, if I take this chair?" a friendly voice asked in
excellent English.</p>
<p>Mildenhall glanced up and recognized the man who had been Mr. Benjamin's
companion in the bank a short time before.</p>
<p>"By no means," he answered courteously. "Why not the settee? It is more
comfortable and, after all, I don't take up much room."</p>
<p>With a bow the newcomer seated himself, handed his coat and hat to a waiter
and gave an order. He glanced at the paper in Mildenhall's hands.</p>
<p>"One wastes much time nowadays," he remarked, "with these fugitive journals.
It seems to me that much is written which is not worth the ink."</p>
<p>"I gather that you are not a journalist!"</p>
<p>"I am not," was the quiet reply. "Clever men, no doubt, but what they are
responsible for! Half the wars in the world are caused by the Press. Every
grievance of mankind is nurtured by their pens. News itself is good, but news
is the last thing one finds&mdash;in the evening papers, at any rate. The one
you have there is engaged in an unholy crusade. It is doing great harm in the
city. It is stirring up bad feeling in this place of beautiful things and
kindly people."</p>
<p>"Did I not see you an hour ago in Benjamin's bank?" Mildenhall asked.</p>
<p>"You did indeed, sir. Mr. Leopold Benjamin is one of the men I admire most
in the world. He is a great philanthropist, a great artist, a lover of the
human race, a good man. But life for him at the present moment is poisoned by
the campaign in a certain section of the Press."</p>
<p>Mildenhall nodded sympathetically.</p>
<p>"This crusade against the Jews." he murmured.</p>
<p>"It is a wicked and outrageous crusade," his companion said almost under his
breath and after a careful glance around. "I should not, perhaps, speak like
this in a public place, but I know who you are. I heard your introduction to
Leopold Benjamin. I know, too, that you are an Englishman, and the English have
always been the protectors of any persecuted race."</p>
<p>"Isn't 'persecuted' rather a harsh term?" Mildenhall asked. "The Austrian is
such a kindly person&mdash;at least, so I have fancied from the little I have
seen of him."</p>
<p>"The Austrian by himself is well enough," the other acknowledged. "It is
what there is behind him, driving him on, that is dangerous. You permit?"</p>
<p>He drew a small case from his pocket and handed a card to his companion.</p>
<p>"I myself am not a Jew," he went on, "although my name, which you see there,
rather suggests it. I have a profession which keeps me wandering all over the
world. There are few countries, well-populated countries, which I have not
visited. The empty places do not interest me. I like work, and my work is
amongst human beings. My name, as you see, is Marius Blute and I am a
naturalized Finn."</p>
<p>"From your speech," Mildenhall remarked, "I should have taken you to be
English. From your appearance I should have thought that you were perhaps a
Scandinavian."</p>
<p>"I was really born," Blute confided, "in Finland. My mother was a Finn and
my father, a Russian."</p>
<p>"And your profession?" Mildenhall asked pleasantly.</p>
<p>"Ah, perhaps you will guess that before long," the other replied. "I
understand that we are to meet again at dinner on Thursday."</p>
<p>"Delighted to hear it," Mildenhall assured him. "Tell me, do you think our
host will show us any of his treasures? I have always been told that I should
find choicer pictures in his rooms than in any European gallery."</p>
<p>"That is easily the truth," Blute acquiesced. "As to whether he will open up
the galleries for you, I have my doubts. These are dangerous times for a man
who has such possessions."</p>
<p>"He has dangerous neighbours?"</p>
<p>"Of that we will not speak here. Vienna, alas, is greatly changed. We have a
perfect affliction of the Gestapo here amongst us. The Viennese themselves, the
townspeople, have lost the control of their city. It is sad but it is true. One
by one the men who have made Vienna a great and joyous place have been obliged
to leave it. Those who have added most to its riches and its beauty are the
very ones who are now the most persecuted. What the world of tomorrow may be,
one sometimes wonders! I could take you to the house of one great Austrian
aristocrat at this moment, Mr. Mildenhall. It is not far from here. You would
find him sitting in one small room. At the further end is a curtain and behind
that curtain, which is, I might tell you, of priceless Chinese silk, there is a
bed, and on that bed he sleeps. At the other end there is a table surrounded by
screens the beauty of which no words could describe, and there he dines. There
is a great window hung with curtains which once adorned a Doge's palace. When
they are drawn aside he has one of the most beautiful views in Vienna. That
room and its little antechamber, Mr. Mildenhall, he has not left for twenty
years, and in that room he will die. But if one of the experts, from any part
of the world, who belonged to Benjamin's race and had a sense of financial
values as well as appreciation saw that room, he would tell you that millions
of your English pounds would not buy the contents of that one chamber. There he
sits. He is content so long as he is undisturbed. He gave his life to beauty
and he fears to lose his treasures. He fears so much that he has concentrated
them, weeded them out, kept everything that was a little more beautiful than
anything else of its sort. 'It is too small a room,' he says sometimes, 'to
rob.' But there is fear in his heart at the thought. Some day he will lose
everything. I passed his house not three days ago. I saw one of those loathed
spies watching it. They begin to know where to find what their masters are
craving for&mdash;anything, anything they can turn into gold. One more was
added to the list that afternoon."</p>
<p>Blute's story had been so simply told, was so obviously the result of the
man's own observation, that his companion felt a sudden surge of interest in
the princely hermit guarding his treasures.</p>
<p>"Can't you warn him?" he asked. "Can't he be told that they have marked him
down?"</p>
<p>The other shook his head slowly.</p>
<p>"What would be the good? He is too old to escape, he is too old and tired to
leave his treasures. He will sit there with them all around him until the day
comes that the Gestapo cross his threshold and he hears their fateful summons.
When that time comes it is my belief that he will kill himself."</p>
<p>Mildenhall sighed. The orchestra was playing gay music, the place was filled
with chattering and laughing groups of people who had been able for an hour or
two to put all cares behind them.</p>
<p>"What about our friend Benjamin?" he asked. "Is he in any danger, do you
think?"</p>
<p>"Leopold Benjamin," Blute said solemnly, "has the spotlight of fate playing
on him at the present moment. Sometimes I wonder that he has escaped so long.
He is the most prominent Jew in the city, he has been fined huge sums, he gives
large amounts to charity, the old aristocracy of the country who refuse to open
their doors even to their highly-born neighbours have welcomed him into their
midst. He holds a great place in the hearts of the people here but, to tell you
the truth, he is the anxiety of my life. Even I dare not tell him that if he
remains in the city he is doomed. He is too rich, too powerful to escape. He
will be one of the first victims of the disaster which threatens Austria. I
have been here for two years doing nothing else but looking after him. I shall
do all I can, although it will very likely cost me my life. I shall give it
without hesitation. Nevertheless, Leopold Benjamin is doomed. I sat with him in
that beautiful office of his this afternoon. I showed him a way to escape. 'And
my pictures?' he asked. 'My treasures?' 'We could smuggle some things away,' I
told him. He shook his head. 'I am a greedy man,' he said. 'I can part with
nothing.' What are you to do with anyone like that? I keep the way open, but I
fear that he will be obstinate to the end."</p>
<p>Mildenhall glanced at his watch and rose to his feet.</p>
<p>"Perhaps I shall be able to tell you better in a few days," he said. "I dine
there then and I hope to see a few of the Old Masters, anyhow."</p>
<p>Marius Blute sighed.</p>
<p>"A few days," he murmured. "Yes, I should think a few days is about the
limit of time. You may still eat your dinner at the Palais Franz Josef, Mr.
Mildenhall. You will drink the choicest wines in Austria and eat the food
prepared by our one great chef, but it will be rather like the feast before the
descent of the Philistines."</p>
<p>Charles Mildenhall, with a farewell nod, left the place with his companion's
words ringing in his ears, but more poignantly even than those words he
remembered the shadow which seemed to be lurking in the sad eyes of the man
with whom he had spoken only for a few minutes in the bank. Leopold Benjamin
had indeed the air of a man on his way towards death.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>Mildenhall entered the British Embassy with the air of an habitu&eacute;. He
had a few words with the Ambassador, Sir John Maxwell-Tremearne, whom he found
distrait and worried, and went on to see Freddie Lascelles, First Secretary and
a man of some importance in the social and sporting side of Viennese life.
Lascelles, too, wore a somewhat worried look and after the first few words led
his visitor into a private room.</p>
<p>"Always around like a stormy petrel when there's a bit of trouble going,
aren't you, Charles?" he observed grimly. "What are you doing this way? And
where did you come from?"</p>
<p>"Oh, just knocking about," Mildenhall replied, helping himself to one of his
friend's cigarettes. "I was in Budapest last."</p>
<p>"Got the jitters over there, haven't they?"</p>
<p>"Jitters everywhere! Europe's like one of those unlit bonfires already
smouldering underneath."</p>
<p>"Is it true that Poland is completely mobilized?" Lascelles asked.</p>
<p>His visitor's face was absolutely blank.</p>
<p>"Some report of that sort going round," he observed. "Look here, when is our
next bag going?"</p>
<p>"To-night."</p>
<p>"Plane or rail?"</p>
<p>"Don't know," Lascelles replied, leaning back for a telephone. "Wait a
minute, there's a good fellow."</p>
<p>He held a brief conversation in fluent German with some unseen person.</p>
<p>"Plane," he announced as he rang off.</p>
<p>"What time?"</p>
<p>"Latish. The Chief is dining at the Chancellery and he'll have a brief
report to put in when he comes back. How much room do you want?"</p>
<p>"Only enough for my weekly chatter...I'll do it here, if you don't mind.
Shall I be in the way for a couple of hours or so?"</p>
<p>"Lock you up here with pleasure. Do you want a code book?"</p>
<p>"I may as well have one. I ought not to need it, though."</p>
<p>There was a gleam of admiration in Lascelles' eyes as he made a few
preparations for his friend's comfort.</p>
<p>"What wouldn't I give for a memory like yours!" he observed. "Ten or fifteen
pages of foolscap, your last report, I remember, straight into code."</p>
<p>"Rather more this time, I'm afraid," Mildenhall sighed. "As to the
memory&mdash;that's only a trick."</p>
<p>"Wish I had it! Do you mean to say you have no notes even?"</p>
<p>"Not one," Mildenhall replied.</p>
<p>"And when did you send your last report home?"</p>
<p>"Warsaw, last Thursday."</p>
<p>"And you are going to sit down now and turn into code, probably without a
code book at all, a report of how many visits and conversations?"</p>
<p>Mildenhall smiled.</p>
<p>"You run off and play, my friend," he advised. "Plenty of sealing wax
there?"</p>
<p>"A drawerful. Are you going to pay your respects to Her Ladyship this
evening?"</p>
<p>"I'll see what the time is when I've finished."</p>
<p>"Two bells on your desk," Lascelles pointed out. "One for secretarial help,
the other domestic. I'm living in just now. Telephone up to me and we'll have a
cocktail if you've finished in time."</p>
<p>He disappeared with a farewell nod. An English servant appeared a few
minutes later with a small despatch case and a sealed envelope. Mildenhall
greeted him with a friendly word or two.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lascelles says, sir, don't forget to speak to him before you go. He's
free for dinner if you would care to join him."</p>
<p>"I'll see what time I finish, Butler. Thank him very much all the same.
Things pretty gay here still?"</p>
<p>The man shook his head sadly.</p>
<p>"Not the same, sir. Nothing's quite the same. The sparkle's gone out of the
place, if you know what I mean, sir."</p>
<p>"People gone 'nervy,' eh?"</p>
<p>"They're afraid of what might be coming, sir. That's what's wrong with them.
It's the gentleman on the other side that they're afraid of."</p>
<p>Mildenhall's expression was once again utterly blank. He nodded slightly and
waved his hand towards the door.</p>
<p>"Tell Mr. Lascelles that I'll look him up as soon as I can," he
enjoined.</p>
<p>The servant took his leave. For a few minutes Mildenhall sat like a man deep
in thought. His eyes wandered round the room. Everything was quite familiar.
For the last seven or eight years he had finished those secret European tours
of his, which had brought him so much distinction at the Foreign Office, in
Vienna and written home from this same room his final report. The apartment was
unchanged, the two doors were closed, the curtains were drawn, his solitude was
assured. He broke the seal of the envelope and withdrew a small key, its sole
contents. With the key he unlocked the despatch box and withdrew the code book.
He pushed the case away and propped up the code book in a conspicuous place
just in front of him. Then he drew out from the rack a pile of the heavy
embossed, blue foolscap paper, examined his fountain pen and started to
write.<br>
<br></p>
<p>In two hours time his task was finished. The eight sheets of foolscap
covered with clear, bold handwriting contained, in carefully chosen code, the
result of one secret visit to Moscow and three briefer sojourns at Warsaw,
Bucharest and Budapest. Mildenhall lit a cigarette and read through all that he
had written. There was a faint flicker of self-satisfaction in his smile as he
finished. He made no corrections, not a single alteration, but he added just
two words in a code so utterly secret between himself and the person who would
read his report that the code itself existed only in the memories of the two
men. He folded up the eight sheets, found the proper linen envelope, used
liberally the brown sealing wax and his own seal. Then he replaced the code
book in the despatch box, locked it up and enclosed the key itself in another
envelope, which he scaled and stamped. Finally he rang the bell. A young man
wearing heavy glasses, pale and eminently secretarial, made his appearance. He
greeted the solitary occupant of the room without a smile.</p>
<p>"Good evening, Mr. Mildenhall."</p>
<p>"Good evening, Paul. There you are."</p>
<p>He handed over the packet. The young man took it into his charge.</p>
<p>"I will place it in the safe deposit, sir, until we open it at midnight for
the bag. His Excellency will have returned by then."</p>
<p>"Who takes the plane over to-night?" Mildenhall asked.</p>
<p>"Major Grimmet, sir."</p>
<p>"Nice safe fellow," Mildenhall approved. "I wouldn't mind a ride over with
him myself."</p>
<p>"You're not leaving us just yet, sir?" the secretary asked.</p>
<p>"Not just yet," was the somewhat vague reply. "Do you know if Mr. Lascelles
is still in his room?"</p>
<p>"He is there and hoping to see you."</p>
<p>"And Her Ladyship?"</p>
<p>"Her Ladyship is dining in. She told me that if you rang before nine o'clock
you could go in and have a cocktail with her."</p>
<p>Mildenhall glanced at his watch.</p>
<p>"Just five minutes," he remarked. "A cocktail sounds extraordinarily good to
me, Paul."</p>
<p>"You will find Her Ladyship in the small drawing-room. Mr. Lascelles said
that he would probably join you there."<br>
<br></p>
<p>Lady Maxwell-Tremearne was the typical ambassador's wife. She was born in
Washington of American parents, had met her future husband on a winter-sports
visit to the Austrian Tyrol and was married to him within a month or so of his
appointment as First Secretary to the British Embassy in Washington. She was
still under forty and exceedingly popular in Viennese society. She welcomed
Charles Mildenhall warmly when he was announced by the seneschal of the
household. She was lying on a sofa drawn up before a log fire and was
surrounded with newspapers.</p>
<p>"My dear Charles!" she exclaimed. "How nice to see you."</p>
<p>He kissed her fingers and drew a chair to her side.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry to see you reading all these semi-official newspapers," he
declared, after a few amenities had passed between them. "You'll get in such a
state of hopeless confusion if you try to read them all. There's the official
organ of the Heimwehr, the Nazi rag, the Government organ and the
Schutzbund!"</p>
<p>"I know," she sighed. "It's terribly difficult. I used to think our American
politics were involved enough, but it's much worse over here. Tell me what's
going to happen, Charles."</p>
<p>He laughed&mdash;almost light-heartedly.</p>
<p>"My dear Sarah," he exclaimed, "why ask me? I thought you knew that politics
weren't in my line. I've come over here to escape from them. I'm always nervous
that some day or other my family will insist upon my going into
Parliament."</p>
<p>"Politics in England are different," she declared a little pettishly. "They
don't mean bloodshed as they do here. Do you know, there has been quite a lot
of fighting in the streets and the way they are treating these poor Jews is
something awful. You remember Otto von Lenberg?"</p>
<p>"Why, of course," he answered.</p>
<p>"The Von Lenbergs aren't really Jews at all," she told him, "but just
because he defended the Herzfelds when their properties were confiscated he has
been turned out of the Courts and fined millions. He is in prison at the
present moment and Olga is nearly out of her mind. Heaps and heaps of our
friends have been branded suspects. The Austrian Nazis are getting stronger
here every day. It really is alarming, Charles. We are expecting the Germans to
cross the frontier at any moment and I can't imagine what will happen then. I
don't particularly care for Jews, Charles, but some of them are quite
delightful people and they are being treated brutally."</p>
<p>"What does Sir John think about it?" Mildenhall asked.</p>
<p>"He doesn't think anything, of course," she answered. "He can't. He's the
ambassador of a foreign country and he can't open his mouth. It's different
with you. You've practically left the Service, John says. You must admit that
this Jew baiting, for a civilized nation, is a filthy affair."</p>
<p>"I'm dining with a Jew on Thursday," Mildenhall remarked. "A Jew banker,
too. I hope he's not going to get into trouble."</p>
<p>"Not one of the Rothschilds?"</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>"No. Leopold Benjamin."</p>
<p>She looked at him with uplifted eyebrows and an almost-frightened light in
her eyes.</p>
<p>"Why, he's just the one man I'm most alarmed about," she confided. "I think
he's the most lovable creature, but they say he's already had to pay two
enormous fines and I heard only the other night that he is a marked man. I've
never heard you speak of him before, have I?"</p>
<p>"I never met him until this afternoon," Mildenhall replied. "I met him in
his own bank and he asked me to dine. I want awfully to see his pictures."</p>
<p>"He has the most gorgeous collection of everything artistic that you can
imagine," Lady Tremearne said impressively. "My dear, he has a Murillo I would
give my soul for, and a Fra Filippo Lippi more beautiful than the one in the
Pitti Palace. John says his collection must be worth many millions of
dollars."</p>
<p>"Must cost him some sleepless nights just now, I should think."</p>
<p>"We're getting used to them here," she sighed. "There is fighting of a sort
in the streets most nights. If you've come here for some fun, Charles, I'm
afraid you're going to be disappointed. The caf&eacute; life still goes on, I
believe, but there are no parties, not even amongst our own people. Everyone
here seems to be sitting with bated breath waiting for something or other.
Fancy what I'm reduced to in the way of dissipation nowadays! The Archduchess
Katherine&mdash;you remember, you met them in the Tyrol somewhere&mdash;the
Princess Madziwill and Molly Morton&mdash;the wife of our Embassy Counsellor
here&mdash;dine with me and play bridge twice a week! They're coming to-night.
What do you think of that for gay Vienna?"</p>
<p>"Very pleasant, I should call it." he remarked. "I haven't played bridge for
I don't know how long. Your one great party of the year is coming off, I hear,
as usual."</p>
<p>"The Von Liebenstrahls? What courage! They're safely away in their
<i>Schloss</i>, which they say is a complete fortress and as big as a small
town, and they're opening up the Palace here in Vienna just for that one party.
Every spring for years theirs has been the great social event of Vienna and the
Field Marshal will insist upon having it as usual. There are a hundred servants
down here making the Palace ready now."</p>
<p>"The true Viennese spirit," he approved. "They say Prince von Liebenstrahl
is the bravest man in Austria and his wife is still the most beautiful woman.
It's years since I saw them."</p>
<p>"Have you ever been to one of their balls?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Never."</p>
<p>"You'd better come with us. You'll still see the most beautiful women in
Europe and the most marvellous collection of uniforms."</p>
<p>"Very kind of you," Mildenhall said a little dubiously.</p>
<p>"We have forty people dining, as it is," Lady Tremearne confided, "but we'll
squeeze you in somewhere. The English and American Embassies have always given
dinner parties. I believe the Countess Otobini, the wife of the Hungarian
Minister, is having one this year."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid dinner is off for me," he regretted. "It's the night I am dining
with Benjamin."</p>
<p>"Then I shan't say another word about my little feast," she laughed. "Mr.
Benjamin himself eats scarcely anything, but he is a great epicure and he pays
his chef an immense salary. Then his wines, too, are the most famous in Vienna.
What you probably won't get, and although I know it's a brutal taste I still
like them, is a cocktail. I told Mr. Benjamin so once myself and there was that
pained look in his eyes as though someone had played a wrong note on a violin
or dropped an 'h' in the middle of a beautiful speech. He never said a word but
I could see him suffering."</p>
<p>"He's perfectly right, of course. Spirits are crude things, however
cunningly they are mixed, compared to wines."</p>
<p>Lascelles made rather a hurried entrance and took Mildenhall by the arm.</p>
<p>"We must fly," he declared. "Your guests are coming up the grand staircase.
Lady Tremearne. I shall take Mildenhall down the back way."</p>
<p>Lady Tremearne smiled.</p>
<p>"Tweeds are quite all right until ten o'clock in this country," she said,
"and I'm sure he'd like to see the Archduchess again."</p>
<p>"Later on in the week, perhaps," Mildenhall said as he felt his friend's
compelling touch. "You will excuse us, Lady Tremearne? I shall pay my formal
call to-morrow."</p>
<p>She dismissed them with a little wave of the hand.</p>
<p>"Wish me luck," she called out. "Fifty cents a hundred and we play the
forcing two!"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>Victor's smooth face was wreathed in smiles as he led Lascelles and
Mildenhall, his two distinguished guests, to their places an hour later in the
most famous of Vienna's smaller restaurants. He was reputed to speak the
language of every recognized nation in Europe and his English was smooth and
faultless.</p>
<p>"It is a great pleasure for me," he said, "to welcome Mr. Mildenhall back to
Vienna. Mr. Lascelles has always his table here, although he dines at his
beautiful Embassy more often than I could wish. To-night many of my valued
patrons are honouring me. Sometimes I see them&mdash;sometimes I do not. The
Archduke to-night, <i>par exemple</i>, I do not see, but Mr. Mildenhall will
agree with me, I am sure, that his companion is very, very beautiful."</p>
<p>He ushered the two men into their <i>b&ocirc;ite</i>. A bowl of dark red
roses stood in the centre of the small round table prepared for two, and the
array of glass would have looked equally at home in a museum. They took their
places. Victor spread out his hands.</p>
<p>"For the guests whom I would like to honour," he confided, "I carry no menu.
I think that I know well the tastes of Monsieur Lascelles, I believe that I can
divine those of Monsieur Mildenhall. I shall not shock you if I offer you the
new season's caviar with the ninety-year-old vodka, the first of the young
salmon from our own noble river, a baby deer with some garnishings of young
hog's flesh, a salad which I prepare here and a souffle incomparable, something
invented only last week by the nephew of my chef, the Cordon Bleu Maurice, who
serves his apprenticeship here. With the salmon a Berncasteler Doktor of '84
will serve to help you forget the crudeness of the vodka. With the deer I would
offer a Chateau Mouton-Rothschild of 1870. Of the brandy we speak later."</p>
<p>"Victor has ideas!" Mildenhall murmured.</p>
<p>"Such a meal should be set to poetry," Lascelles suggested.</p>
<p>"But for poetry or for music where else would you go?" Victor demanded.
"They all tell me that my restaurant is the meeting-place of lovely women, and
you are precisely the right distance away to appreciate the most wonderful
music Strauss ever wrote, played by the <i>maestro</i>."</p>
<p>"We submit, Victor," Mildenhall remarked with a twinkle in his eyes. "You
are the Emperor of Gastronomy!"</p>
<p>Victor bowed low and left them.<br>
<br></p>
<p>Mildenhall's whole attention during the next few minutes was concentrated,
as far as discretion permitted, upon the table exactly opposite.</p>
<p>"I think," he pronounced, "the woman with Karl Sebastian is the most
beautiful creature I have ever seen in my life."</p>
<p>Lascelles permitted himself a glance across the room.</p>
<p>"Most of Vienna thinks as you do, my friend," he admitted. "An introduction
would be quite in order, but&mdash;not to-night."</p>
<p>"Tell me her name," Mildenhall asked. "I can't remember having seen her here
before."</p>
<p>"The name by which she is generally known, and to which I believe she is
absolutely entitled, is the Baroness von Ballinstrode. I have heard there was a
previous marriage, to a man whose name I have forgotten, which was annulled,
but I don't think the divorce was properly legalized. Very complicated, some of
these religious quibbles."</p>
<p>"Overwhelmingly Teutonic," Mildenhall murmured, "but nevertheless exquisite.
I have never seen such a complexion&mdash;bluer eyes&mdash;a more fascinating
smile. She has almost too much animation for her type."</p>
<p>"If you stay long enough I must certainly see about that introduction,"
Lascelles observed. "The Archduke is here for the Von Liebenstrahls' dance on
Thursday. A day or two afterwards he and the Archduchess will return to their
castle in the mountains, unless he can get off on his own for a few weeks to
Monte Carlo. A week is about as long as he dare spend in Vienna, nowadays.
Lucky for him if another <i>putsch</i> doesn't come while he's in the city.
He's not much of a politician but he's quite a figurehead."</p>
<p>"What about the <i>Anschluss</i>?"'</p>
<p>"No politics, there's a dear fellow," Lascelles begged. "I don't know where
the Germans got the idea from," he added, looking round, "but they always think
that Englishmen&mdash;especially if they are connected with diplomacy in any
way&mdash;are nothing but 'gasbags/ This place is a favourite rendezvous of the
Royalists&mdash;the few of them that are left. I should think we are certain to
have a visit from the Gestapo, unless Victor succeeds in keeping them away.
Wish I were going back with you, Charles. Central Europe is getting on my
nerves."</p>
<p>The caviar arrived and with its many <i>et ceteras</i> absorbed the
attention of the two men for a time.</p>
<p>"There is no vodka like this in the world," Lascelles remarked as he sipped
it slowly. "Soft as velvet, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"It's marvellous," his friend agreed. "Perfect food, perfect wine and
glorious women. Think what would happen to us if anything went wrong with
Vienna!"</p>
<p>Lascelles' face seemed suddenly to have lost all expression. His fingers
were toying with the flask of vodka.</p>
<p>"Gestapo!" he murmured under his breath. "The one thing I regret in Vienna
just now is the passing of the polo. Since the Hungarian team broke up there
hasn't been a decent game."</p>
<p>"It's the County cricket I miss through travelling so much," Mildenhall
observed with equal seriousness. "I saw Yorkshire play twice last year but I
missed the West Indian Test Match. Free hitting and lots of it&mdash;that's the
type of cricket I like to see."</p>
<p>Four members of the Gestapo&mdash;brawny, muscular young men with evil
faces&mdash;stood in the middle of the restaurant talking to a very
solemn-faced Victor. One of them detached himself and strolled in leisurely
fashion about the place gazing insolently at the diners. Before one of the
least conspicuous tables, where a man was dining alone, he stopped. The man
continued to eat, taking apparently no notice of what was going on around him.
The intruder knocked on the table with his knuckles. The diner looked up and
asked what seemed to be a simple question. The S.S. man shouted at him angrily.
His voice was heard all over the room.</p>
<p>"What's your name?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"Behrling&mdash;Antoine Behrling," was the distinctly spoken reply.</p>
<p>"Your papers!"</p>
<p>The man looked up.</p>
<p>"It is not necessary for me to carry papers," he said. "I am Viennese."</p>
<p>"You are a Jew," the other declared angrily.</p>
<p>The diner shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"I am nothing of the sort," he answered. "I am a Catholic."</p>
<p>"We'll see about that!"</p>
<p>Victor came hurrying across the room. It evidently cost him an effort to
speak politely.</p>
<p>"This gentleman," he said, "is a well-known lawyer. His name is Behrling and
he is not the kind of person you are looking for at all."</p>
<p>"How do you know?"</p>
<p>Victor turned away. The man looked after him scowling.</p>
<p>"If you're a lawyer, why didn't you say so?" he asked, turning back to the
table.</p>
<p>"You did not ask me my profession."</p>
<p>"Do not leave your place until I give you permission!"</p>
<p>The Nazi swaggered across the room towards where his companions were
standing. They had a final look round, discussed Behrling for a moment but the
apparent leader of the little band shook his head.</p>
<p>"A lucky night for you, Victor," one of the younger men remarked.</p>
<p>"Not particularly," was the quiet reply. "It is not a matter of chance at
all. I have no patrons who would be likely to interest you."</p>
<p>"No impudence!" the sergeant snapped, pointing to a table. "Send us four
glasses of beer over there."</p>
<p>"I regret," Victor said, "that we do not serve beer in this restaurant."</p>
<p>"You'll serve what I order!" was the angry retort.</p>
<p>It was several moments before Victor spoke again. When he did so his voice
seemed to have faded away. It was raised scarcely above a whisper. It was none
the less impressive.</p>
<p>"We natives and citizens of Vienna," he said, "are well aware of the danger
in which we stand. In a very short time you may be within your rights in
forcing your way into a hundred-year-old restaurant and demanding that its
rules shall be broken and that you shall occupy a table unbecomingly clothed.
But tonight I am still master here. The Chief of the Police of the city has
booked a table here to-night and is already due, so you will be able to state
your grievances in a few minutes. Until that time comes you will kindly take
your leave."</p>
<p>There was a moment's hesitation. The situation was beginning to present
difficulties.</p>
<p>"What if we order champagne?" one of the men blustered.</p>
<p>"I should still refuse to serve you here as guests," Victor announced. "I
should also warn you that my champagne is very expensive."</p>
<p>Herr Antoine Behrling seemed to have been entirely forgotten. The four men
swaggered out of the place. Victor watched them leave, waiting until he heard
the door close behind them. Then he returned, making his way towards his
office. Lascelles leaned forward towards him as he passed their
<i>b&ocirc;ite</i>. The words of congratulation, however, died away upon his
lips. He could see that the <i>restaurateur</i> was still shivering.</p>
<p>"Bravely done, Victor," he said pleasantly. "We shall enjoy all the more
your most wonderful dinner."</p>
<p>"I have never tasted anything to compare with your young deer," Mildenhall
declared. "As for your Chateau Mouton-Rothschild&mdash;it has a fault."</p>
<p>Nothing could have galvanized Victor more suddenly into his ordinary
self.</p>
<p>"It was perhaps a little overwarm?" he suggested anxiously.</p>
<p>"Not in the least, my friend," his patron assured him. "But for wine
drinkers&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"One bottle!"</p>
<p>A smile broke across Victor's lips. He was himself again. He drew a little
silver thermometer from his pocket.</p>
<p>"Five minutes, gentlemen. It shall be no longer," he assured them. "I will
guarantee you exactly the same temperature."<br>
<br></p>
<p>On their way out the Archduke summoned them. He shook hands with both.</p>
<p>"My friend Lascelles I often see," he remarked. "We play bridge sometimes at
the club. You, Mr. Mildenhall, are more of a stranger. I believe, though, that
we have met."</p>
<p>"I have had the honour of dining with you, sir, two years ago, after a
shooting party near your <i>Schloss&gt;</i>," Mildenhall reminded him.</p>
<p>"Of course I remember," the Archduke said graciously. "You were staying with
the Von Liebenstrahls. I remember remarking how well you young Englishmen shot
considering the different conditions over here...Baroness, you must permit me
to present my two friends&mdash;Mr. Lascelles from the British Embassy and Mr.
Mildenhall, whom I heard someone once call a 'diplomatic vagrant.'"</p>
<p>The Baroness held out her fingers to Lascelles and afterwards received
Mildenhall's bow. Upon Lascelles she bestowed a smile of courtesy. She looked
into Charles Mildenhall's eyes with a different expression. It seemed to him,
and he was by no means conceited, that she withdrew her fingers almost with
reluctance.</p>
<p>"Mr. Mildenhall does not come often enough to Vienna," she remarked.</p>
<p>"To-night's experience tells me that you speak the truth, Baroness," he
replied.</p>
<p>"What does His Highness mean when he calls you a 'diplomatic vagrant'?" she
asked.</p>
<p>"I started life in the Diplomatic Service," he told her, "but for some years
I have been only partially attached."</p>
<p>"You lack fidelity?"</p>
<p>"Scarcely that, Baroness. I happen to possess a gift which we English, I
fear, acquire with too much difficulty. I have the knack of speaking most
European languages. Therefore, if there is any small trouble in any one of
these countries whose language seems to be brimming over with consonants, I act
for our government as messenger boy or peacemaker. The occupation has its
advantages, but I can conceive nothing more wonderful than being in my friend
Lascelles' position."</p>
<p>"And why?" she asked softly.</p>
<p>He leaned a little farther across the table. Certainly hers were the bluest
eyes he had ever seen.</p>
<p>"Because I find Vienna the centre of civilization," he told her. "It
possesses the best food, the most wonderful wines and the most beautiful women
in the world."</p>
<p>"And since when," she persisted, "have you arrived at that conclusion?"</p>
<p>He glanced at his platinum wrist watch.</p>
<p>"Two hours and five minutes ago, Baroness."</p>
<p>"You are evidently a gourmet," she smiled. "I noticed that you were taking
great interest in those wonderful dishes which were being served at your
table."</p>
<p>"A gesture, Baroness," he assured her. "When one is so utterly content with
one's surroundings it is necessary, sometimes, to dissemble."</p>
<p>She leaned back in her place and laughed frankly.</p>
<p>"From now on," she declared, "I change my opinion of all Englishmen."</p>
<p>The Archduke grunted.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lascelles," he said, "you must remove your young friend. I am becoming
jealous. Nevertheless, I hope that we shall all meet again before long."</p>
<p>He waved them graciously away.</p>
<p>"Your opinion is unchanged?" Lascelles asked as he took his friend's arm
outside.</p>
<p>"I still think," Mildenhall replied, "that she is the most perfectly
beautiful creature I have ever seen."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>The mansion of Leopold Benjamin, more than once the habitation of royalty,
was encircled by a railing of iron bars as thick as a man's wrist, with spiked
tops, reaching at least eight feet high. The lodge keeper, who somewhat
reluctantly had answered Charles Mildenhall's summons, took down his name in a
book, after which he swung open the great gates and motioned him forward. As
far as he could see, when at last he reached the imposing entrance, the whole
house on the other side of the huge front door was in complete darkness. He
raised the knocker&mdash;a massive, wrought-iron affair&mdash;after a few
moments' hesitation, and although he could hear the bell, with which it seemed
to be connected, ringing somewhere in the realms of darkness beyond, he felt
almost inclined to beat a retreat. It was a night of terror in the city. In the
far distance he could hear the rat-tat-tat of machine guns and overhead the
droning of planes. The streets were rapidly becoming deserted. To present
oneself for an informal dinner party when all Vienna was shaken with tremors of
fear, seemed a little ridiculous. He was, as a matter of fact, on the point of
turning away when he became aware of a sudden blaze of light shining through
the windows on either side of him. There were footsteps from within. The door
was suddenly opened. A bowing manservant welcomed him and closed the door
immediately upon his entrance.</p>
<p>"Mr. Benjamin is, I think, expecting me for dinner," Mildenhall announced,
"or perhaps&mdash;" he hesitated. "The city is in such a disturbed
state&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<i>Der gn&atilde;diger Herr</i> is expected," the man assured him,
collecting his coat and hat with another low bow. "Be so good as to follow
me."</p>
<p>Mildenhall looked around him in astonishment. The great hall, which was more
like the nave of a cathedral, was beautifully but softly illuminated by
hundreds of shaded lamps. There were pictures hanging everywhere&mdash;Old
Masters, many of them. The world-famous portrait of Frederick the Great
dominated the wall on his right. Back in the shadows was the no-less-famous
marble statue of Shunach's Venus. There were treasures on either side of him on
which he had no time to bestow more than a casual glance as he followed his
guide into the great reception room.</p>
<p>"Herr Mildenhall," the man announced.</p>
<p>At first Mildenhall thought that the huge apartment was empty. Then a girl,
who had been curled up in an easy chair, threw down her book, shook out her
skirts and rose to her feet. She came forward to meet him with a delightful
smile of welcome.</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry that Mr. Benjamin is a few minutes late," she apologized as
she held out her hand. "You will please excuse him, Mr. Mildenhall, and talk to
me for a moment. My name is Patricia Grey. I am one of Mr. Benjamin's
secretaries."</p>
<p>"I am delighted to meet you. Miss Grey," Mildenhall said. "To tell you the
truth, after that bewildering walk from the front entrance it is rather a
relief to find something of normal size."</p>
<p>She laughed gaily.</p>
<p>"Do you know," she told him, "half the people who come here as strangers and
face the splendours of the hall for the first time arrive in this room in
rather a dazed condition. It is more like a museum than a private house, I
admit. Do sit down, please. There will be a cocktail directly. Tell me&mdash;is
it quiet outside?"</p>
<p>"Not very," he admitted. "And by-the-by, half of Vienna believes that Mr.
Benjamin left the city this morning. I'm afraid things don't look very
good."</p>
<p>"I think they look horrible," she agreed. "You know, of course, from my
accent that I am an American. We are used to noise in the streets in New York,
but this is all different. It's terribly upsetting. We've been trying hard to
get Mr. Benjamin to leave, but he's very obstinate sometimes. He always feels
that he might be of help to some of his own people here."</p>
<p>"But what could he do?" Mildenhall asked. "The place seems to be in an
uproar already. I really wondered whether I ought to come to-night. I would not
have ventured but I went into the bank this afternoon and they told me there
that Mr. Benjamin was not thinking of leaving."</p>
<p>"Mr. Benjamin," she said, "is a wonderful man. He was born in Vienna in this
very house and time after time he has announced his intention of dying here.
The fact that he is a Jew never disturbs him. He calls himself Viennese. I
should think no one has a better right."</p>
<p>The door was opened. Marius Blute was announced. The girl welcomed him as an
old friend. He shook hands with Mildenhall and drew up a chair.</p>
<p>"Things are a little quieter, I believe," the newcomer reported. "They talk
about parleys and all that sort of thing. I don't believe in them. What has to
come has to come. Much better to get it over."</p>
<p>"You don't mean that you want the Germans to take over Austria?" the girl
asked.</p>
<p>"I do not mean it," he replied, "but however much we may dislike it, they
are going to do it. How is our beloved Chief?"</p>
<p>"Just escaped from my hands," she confided. "I let him off as easily as
possible but there were hundreds of papers to be signed. He'll be down in a few
minutes. I never know exactly how many people are dining but I am sure it's a
small party to-night so I think that we might have cocktails served."</p>
<p>"A heavenly thought," Blute declared, springing to his feet. "You see," he
added, turning to Mildenhall, "I know the ways of the house so I am allowed to
ring the bell."</p>
<p>Dr. and Mrs. Schwarz, evidently habitu&eacute;s, were announced.</p>
<p>"Dr. Schwarz," Patricia Grey told Mildenhall, "is the President of the
famous Benjamin Hospital. I'll show you a photograph of it," she added, rising
to her feet. "Please come with me."</p>
<p>She led him to the farther end of the room and unfastened a portfolio.</p>
<p>"You needn't look at these," she said. "You may-take my word for it that it
is the most up-to-date hospital in Vienna and the entire cost is borne by Mr.
Benjamin."</p>
<p>"Your Chief is a Prince of Philanthropists," Mildenhall declared. "I agree
with you, though, I don't want to see any photographs of hospitals. I want you
to tell me about yourself."</p>
<p>"I'm really a bank secretary," she confided. "I happen to be pretty good at
languages so they sent me over here to train the girls. Our banks are just a
little more modern, you know, in New York. I worked at that for a year and then
Mr. Benjamin made me his private secretary. I have a small suite of rooms in
the house and when none of his married daughters or Mrs. Benjamin are
here&mdash;he has crowds of relations, you know&mdash;I help him with his
dinners. I wanted to say something to you, Mr. Mildenhall."</p>
<p>"There are a great many things I should like to say to you," the young man
assured her.</p>
<p>She laughed up at him.</p>
<p>"That can come afterwards. Listen! Mr. Benjamin seems to have taken rather a
fancy to you. He tells me that you travel all over Europe and that you know as
much of what is going on as anyone. Tell me, do you think the Nazis who are
coming into Vienna are going to be as wicked with the Jews as they were in
Germany?"</p>
<p>Mildenhall looked at her thoughtfully. There was no doubt at all but that
Patricia Grey was a very attractive young woman. She had a piquant face, soft
grey-green eyes, red hair, a slender charming figure and a pleasant voice. Just
now she was very serious.</p>
<p>"Shall I tell you just what I believe?" he asked.</p>
<p>"That's what I want you to do," she begged him earnestly.</p>
<p>"I think they're going to be very bad," he said. "No one knows how many
millions the government of Germany has taken from the Jews. The Austrian Nazis
have begun, as you know, to do the same thing here. When this country is taken
into the Reich, as it certainly will be, I think that they will treat the
Austrian Jews even worse than they have the German."</p>
<p>"Why should they?" she asked. "The Jews are good citizens."</p>
<p>"Yes, but the German Jews," he told her, "were the great industrialists of
the country. They were behind half the great commercial institutions. They were
leading lights in nearly all the professions. Here the same condition of things
exists, of course, but the very richest Jews of all are aristocrats. There are
many old families in Vienna who have intermarried with Jews, and the Germany of
to-day&mdash;I mean the government&mdash;hates the aristocrats. If I were you.
Miss Patricia Grey, I should do all that I could to get Mr. Benjamin out of the
country before it is too late."</p>
<p>"And he loves his home here so much!" she lamented. "His pictures, his
tapestry and his china&mdash;all those things are his happiness in life. He is
one of the world's greatest collectors, you know."</p>
<p>"Everyone appreciates that," Mildenhall admitted. "Still, you've asked for
my advice. Miss Grey, and you have it. Get Mr. Benjamin out of this country as
quickly as you can."</p>
<p>"You'll tell him what you think, if he asks you, won't you?" she begged.</p>
<p>"It's a promise."</p>
<p>He glanced towards the door. Leopold Benjamin had made his appearance and
there was a bustle of further new arrivals.</p>
<p>"You shall be rewarded," Patricia told him, "for granting my request. I will
now introduce you to the woman all Vienna is talking about."</p>
<p>Mildenhall was standing quite still gazing towards the other end of the
room.</p>
<p>"I think I know whom you mean."</p>
<p>"Already?" she laughed.</p>
<p>"I met her a few nights ago&mdash;that is, if you mean the Baroness von
Ballinstrode."</p>
<p>"And you are a victim, I can see!"</p>
<p>"I met her at Victor's restaurant," he said a little evasively. "She was
with the Archduke Karl Sebastian."</p>
<p>Patricia caught at his arm. They were walking slowly towards the others.</p>
<p>"Don't mention that to anyone," she whispered. "It would be rather a <i>faux
pas</i> here. Mr. Benjamin is devoted to the Archduke and he is also fond of
the Archduchess."</p>
<p>"I will remember," Mildenhall promised.</p>
<p>She flitted away to greet the new arrivals. Mildenhall remained a little in
the background, dividing his attention between the woman he admired and his
host. In his simply cut dinner clothes Leopold Benjamin would have been an
arresting figure anywhere. He was tall&mdash;over six feet&mdash;and very thin,
but his carriage made his height unnoticeable. His features were excellent and
the deep lines in his face detracted nothing from his good looks. His forehead
was high, his grey hair brushed simply back. His expression was very grave in
repose and it was evidently a very serious matter which he was discussing with
the Baroness. Her fingers were resting upon his arm, those beautiful blue eyes
were upturned to his. It was obvious that she was making a request of some sort
which he was not wholly disposed to grant. He suddenly caught sight of Charles
Mildenhall in the background, and beckoned to him with the air of one who
welcomes a diversion.</p>
<p>"We will speak of these serious matters later, Baroness," he said
pleasantly. "I must introduce to you a young friend who is making a flying
visit to Vienna. He belongs, I think, more to your world than do we of this
sober household. Mr. Mildenhall," he added, "the Baroness von Ballinstrode
permits me to present you. Everything you wish to know about the gaiety of this
fascinating city she can reveal."</p>
<p>The Baroness was gracious but showed no signs of ever having heard of
Mildenhall before. The latter, grateful for Patricia Grey's hint, murmured only
the few formal words necessary. Leopold Benjamin turned away to speak to Mrs.
Schwarz.</p>
<p>"Our host is in an obstinate humour this evening," the Baroness confided. "I
have been watching you from a distance," he admitted. "If such a thing were
possible, I should have divined that you were asking him a favour which he was
not disposed to grant."</p>
<p>"You are evidently," she said, sinking into one of the beautiful Empire
chairs and motioning him to draw one to her side, "a person of discernment,
perhaps I should also add&mdash;tact."</p>
<p>"You flatter me," he murmured. "As a matter of fact, I generally lose my
head when I have a really pleasant surprise."</p>
<p>She tapped his knuckles with her fan.</p>
<p>"But listen," she begged. "I was really giving Mr. Benjamin some wonderful
advice, if he would listen to it. The situation to-night is worse but&mdash;you
know a little of the Viennese temperament, I'm sure&mdash;nobody will believe
it. They are light-hearted; they hope always for the best. No one will believe
what I know to be the truth. The Germans have two divisions of picked troops
actually on the frontier. They will be in Austria before daylight
tomorrow."</p>
<p>"As bad as that," he murmured.</p>
<p>"Worse," she answered, "a great deal worse for Leopold Benjamin. I need not
tell you how the Jews have been treated in Germany. It is too awful a subject
to discuss&mdash;especially in this house. But listen, my friend&mdash;I know
these things because I have influential connections&mdash;in this country
Leopold Benjamin stands upon a pinnacle. He is the Emperor of all the Jews. No
one believes that harm could come to him. All the same, it will. I want him to
leave at once. I want him to pack up all those treasures of his&mdash;millions
and millions of your English pounds they are worth&mdash;and take them over the
Swiss frontier. He would be safe there. Not only that&mdash;his treasures would
be safe. He will not listen to me. He will not believe even the late news that
I bring him. Look at him listening to the Princess Sophie's chatter! Don't you
love that gracious stoop of the neck he has? Have you influence with him, Mr.
Mildenhall?"</p>
<p>"Not a scrap," Mildenhall assured her. "He was a great friend of my uncle's,
but I only met him a few days ago and he knows nothing about me except that I
am distantly connected with the British Embassy here."</p>
<p>She looked up at him with a reawakened gleam of interest in her eyes.</p>
<p>"So that was why you were dining with Freddie Lascelles!"</p>
<p>"An old friend of mine," he assented. "We started our career together in
Paris."</p>
<p>"Later on this evening you must tell me all about yourself," she said. "Just
now I feel that I want to talk about nothing but Leopold Benjamin. Someone
ought to make him see reason. He has bad advisers here."</p>
<p>"He looks far too intelligent to make mistakes of that sort," Mildenhall
remarked.</p>
<p>"He is too kindly. He sees nothing but the best side of everybody. How he
came to make this enormous fortune banking I cannot imagine, except that his
father had paved the way for him. Tell me, do you know a queer little
man&mdash;Marius Blute, I think his name is?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I know him. I met him the same day that I met Mr. Benjamin. He's
dining here to-night."</p>
<p>"That man," she said seriously, "is one of Leopold Benjamin's most dangerous
advisers."</p>
<p>"Really? Of course, I know nothing about him," Mildenhall continued, "but I
should not have thought that he possessed sufficient significance to be an
adviser to one of the most astute men in Austria."</p>
<p>Patricia Grey glided up to them. In her simple black frock, with her
delightful figure and marvellous colouring, she presented an altogether
charming appearance&mdash;a complete and intriguing foil to the Baroness.</p>
<p>"We are going in to dinner quite informally," Patricia announced. "We have
not even table cards. Will you look after the Baroness, Mr. Mildenhall? I am
told that I must be somewhere in the neighbourhood as Mr. Mildenhall is our
only stranger tonight."</p>
<p>"Seems to me," he remarked with a smile as he offered his arm to the
Baroness, "that the strangers get all the luck here."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>"This," Patricia told Mildenhall as he took his place in the high-backed
chair next to her at the dining table, "is what Mr. Benjamin's industrious
librarian calls in his guide to the house 'the smaller banqueting hall.' The
fact that there is room for eighty to sit at this table he carefully ignores.
One of Mr. Benjamin's visiting friends called it 'The Room of Faded
Splendours.'"</p>
<p>"He was probably not a person of observation," Mildenhall remarked. "A few
hundreds of years only added subtlety to the colouring of Gobelin tapestries
and the wonder of the world is still the freshness of these Renaissance
paintings. I have never dined before facing a genuine Andrea del Sarto."</p>
<p>"And what do you think of your servitors?" she asked smiling.</p>
<p>He glanced round the table. Behind every chair, in plain but attractive
costume, stood a Viennese parlourmaid. With the exception of Heinrich, the
butler, there was only one manservant in the room&mdash;the wine
seneschal&mdash;and he stood immovable behind his master's chair.</p>
<p>"To tell you the truth," Mildenhall confided, "it was the strangeness of
the&mdash;er&mdash;domestic staff which I noticed even before I realized the
wonder of the picture."</p>
<p>"The service is an old feature of the housekeeping here," Patricia said. "It
was like this in Mr. Benjamin's father's time and his grandfather's."</p>
<p>"To me it always seems," the Baroness remarked from his other side, "that,
notwithstanding all its treasures, the most wonderful thing in the house is its
owner."</p>
<p>"This is only the second time I have seen him," Mildenhall observed, "but I
should think you are probably right."</p>
<p>"If he were not a Jew," she went on, "if he had been able to give his whole
attention to politics, he would without a doubt have led the country. I do not
think that it would have been in its present unhappy state. I think it would
still have been a monarchy with a court the most brilliant in Europe."</p>
<p>"It is an interesting speculation," Mildenhall admitted. "I doubt, though,
whether the bourgeoisie of any country would submit to a revival of monarchal
rule in these days."</p>
<p>"England, my friend! England!"</p>
<p>"The only exception," he agreed, "and Cromwell wasn't much of a dictator,
was he? England is a difficult problem for any historian. When I was at Oxford
the professors told us that the Stuarts had murdered the <i>bourgeoisie</i>
just as the Pitts crushed labour."</p>
<p>"The English tolerate Jews as we do, don't they?" Patricia asked.</p>
<p>"Rather," he answered. "I should imagine that it is to the Jews England owes
her financial prosperity. Except for Disraeli they have never been a success in
politics. They may even have made us a nation of shopkeepers, but they are the
greatest and most vital force in the country now. It is in the professions,
too, that they have triumphed so completely. If Leopold Benjamin had been an
Englishman, he would have been Prime Minister, beyond a doubt."</p>
<p>"There is one thing I do not like about this evening," Dr. Schwarz remarked,
leaning forward in his place. "It is the silence in the streets. When the
Viennese is gay he sings; when he is sad he shuts himself up at home. To-night
he does not make the promenade. Even the caf&eacute;s are half empty."</p>
<p>"Does anyone know," the Princess Sophie, an ample lady who wore a single
eyeglass and was scarcely ever a moment without a cigarette between her lips,
asked, "whether the Von Liebenstrahl ball has been postponed?"</p>
<p>"I called at the Embassy on my way down," Charles Mildenhall confided, "and
everyone was preparing. Lady Tremearne is giving a large dinner for it."</p>
<p>"You are going to the ball afterwards?" the Baroness asked eagerly.</p>
<p>"I believe so," he answered.</p>
<p>"Fortunate man!"</p>
<p>"It is doubtless quite a spectacle, but there are still far more wonderful
things to be seen in this house."</p>
<p>"That depends, my friend," she said. "For a woman, a great feast of colour,
the latest models of all the dressmakers in Europe, a wealth of jewellery that
is only seen once a year, the handsomest of all our men who put on their
uniforms and deck themselves out for this one occasion&mdash;oh, it is a great
sight!"</p>
<p>"You may be disappointed this time," he remarked. "I came from Bucharest
here. Two years ago special planes brought down the King and some of the Court.
Nothing of that sort is happening now."</p>
<p>"The old Prince," she reflected, "is as stubborn as a mule. I think everyone
hoped that it would be postponed. I do not like our lovely music here played to
the accompaniment of bombing planes. The joys of peace and the horrors of war
and revolution should be kept, I think, a long way apart."</p>
<p>Mildenhall turned to the girl on his other side.</p>
<p>"They told me at the Embassy, Miss Grey, that the wonderful galleries here
were closed for the present. Is that true?"</p>
<p>She looked at him a little doubtfully.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid so," she answered. "It nearly broke my Chief's heart, but they
all thought that it was necessary."</p>
<p>Mr. Benjamin leaned across the table.</p>
<p>"Is it true that you wished to see my pictures?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Indeed it is, sir," Mildenhall acknowledged. "Believe me, though, I quite
understand. You are the custodian of such beautiful things that for the sake of
the next generation, as well as for the rest of ours, you must keep them
without risk for saner times."</p>
<p>Mr. Benjamin shook his head sorrowfully.</p>
<p>"It is not the mad people who parade the streets whom I fear," he said. "Not
even the worst of them would damage my home or do harm to my treasures. It is a
colder, more calculating business altogether which places them in danger. I
have been obliged to take steps&mdash;"</p>
<p>Patricia leaned across the table.</p>
<p>"Mr. Benjamin!" she begged.</p>
<p>He smiled at her gently.</p>
<p>"But, my dear," he remonstrated, "to-night we are just a party of
friends&mdash;so few of us&mdash;not a single stranger."</p>
<p>"Mr. Benjamin!" she pleaded once more.</p>
<p>He glanced round the table.</p>
<p>"But, my dear Patricia," he repeated, "I admire your zeal and you know that
I appreciate your care for everything that is so precious to me, but my little
explanation of why I have to refuse so simple and gracious a request was
necessary. Surely I may exonerate myself?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Benjamin," she said firmly, "the words you were about to utter should
not be spoken. Everyone at this table is, of course, above suspicion. That does
not matter. The words should not be spoken."</p>
<p>Mr. Benjamin remained for a moment in a state of distressful indecision.
Mildenhall leaned across to him.</p>
<p>"My dear host," he begged, "I wish, if you please, to withdraw my
thoughtless request. I have read what a very great man who stayed with you for
a month wrote of your pictures and statuary, and his book is one of the few
classics of my life, but believe me I should be perfectly miserable if I
induced you to change any decision you have come to about your treasures or to
alter your arrangements in any way. I have been perfectly honest. If you
offered me your keys and yourself as cicerone I should put on my hat and walk
out of the house for fear you would imperil the safety of any one of
your&mdash;"</p>
<p>Mildenhall broke off in his speech. Louder than ever before that night they
could hear the booming of heavy guns. Nearer at hand the rifle fire had become
more persistent. For a moment a blaze of light filled the room so that the
delicately shaded lamps seemed to exist no longer, and everyone covered his
eyes. There was the sound of an explosion. Then silence. Mr. Benjamin smiled
and patted the Princess Sophie's hand.</p>
<p>"That mine," he told her, "was at least ten miles away. It is our own people
who are making all the disturbance. If the Germans enter the city to-night,
believe me, they will do so in orderly fashion. They will be disciplined troops
and we shall have nothing to fear from them except what we feel
inside&mdash;the humiliation, the sorrow," he concluded, with his hand over his
heart, "which comes with the passing of a great nation. If all negotiations
fail, if the Germans enter the city, we must face what lies before us, but for
the moment, believe me, we are in no danger."</p>
<p>"All the same," Mrs. Schwarz said, wiping her eyes and rising to her feet,
"I think we must go. The streets soon will not be safe."</p>
<p>The Baroness pushed aside her ice and lit a cigarette.</p>
<p>"My car is not yet here," she confided. "I agree with Mr. Benjamin. We are
as safe here as anywhere. There will be no fighting in this quarter. If the
Germans enter it will be as the result of negotiations."</p>
<p>"Negotiations or no negotiations," the Princess declared, "I should like my
car, Leopold."</p>
<p>"And I," Mrs. Schwarz demanded.</p>
<p>The single manservant disappeared. The sound of the cars outside was heard
almost at once. Coffee was served and, in the temporary absence of disturbing
interruptions, everyone seemed to recover himself a little. Very few noticed
the quiet entrance of Marius Blute through a door just behind the banker. He
pushed a slip of paper into Mr. Benjamin's hand and was gone in a moment,
slipping behind the screen and out through the door. Leopold Benjamin, with a
word of excuse to Mrs. Schwarz, with whom he had been conversing, read the
single line, half closed his eyes and then looked across to where Patricia was
watching him. The slightest inclination of his head was sufficient. In a moment
she was standing by his side. He handed her the slip of paper. She read it and
they passed out into the hall together.<br>
<br></p>
<p>Heinrich, the single manservant who had been visible during the service of
dinner except for the seneschal and <i>aide</i> from the wine cellar, threw
open the door.</p>
<p>"The automobiles await Her Highness the Princess von Dorlingen, the Baroness
von Ballinstrode and Dr. and Mrs. Schwarz," he announced.</p>
<p>The Baroness glanced around the room.</p>
<p>"But our host?" she exclaimed. "I rather fancy that was an urgent message he
received," Mildenhall confided. "I saw that funny little man Blute slip in from
behind the screen with a note."</p>
<p>"We'd better wait for a short time, I suppose," she suggested. "I will show
you the music room. It is very famous but there are no treasures there."</p>
<p>Outside in the great hall Heinrich was standing by the opened door and the
cars were in line. There was no sign of Patricia.</p>
<p>"The little girl secretary seems to be a sort of hostess," Mildenhall
reflected. "Perhaps we ought to see if she is about."</p>
<p>"I do not see any necessity," the Baroness declared, as one of the maids
brought her cloak. "I think we go together&mdash;you and 1.1 drop you where you
like. You change your clothes, perhaps, before you go to the ball?"</p>
<p>"I must," he assented. "For that I shall have to go to the Embassy."</p>
<p>"Would you like to drive with me, or would you rather walk?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I should not feel in the least happy," he assured her, "if I let you go
alone. There are all sorts of wild people in the streets."</p>
<p>"Perhaps you had better take me to my apartment first, then," she
proposed.</p>
<p>"It will give me great pleasure."</p>
<p>"Come then."</p>
<p>"Mr. Mildenhall!"</p>
<p>He turned around. Patricia was coming towards him across the hall.</p>
<p>"Could you please come with me for a moment or two? I have a message for
you."</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>He glanced towards the Baroness with a gesture of helplessness. The latter
looked across at Patricia.</p>
<p>"The little lady can give you her message quickly," she suggested. "I will
wait."</p>
<p>Patricia turned to her courteously.</p>
<p>"I cannot ask you to share in the message," she explained, "because it is
rather important and very private, but if Mr. Mildenhall is driving you home,
would you mind waiting in the dining-room? Heinrich will look after you."</p>
<p>"Thank you," the Baroness said. "Heinrich can show me into the car. I shall
sit there and await Herr Mildenhall. Do not keep him too long. He has to change
into uniform and make himself very beautiful for the ball."</p>
<p>She wrapped herself a little more closely in her ermine cloak. In the soft
gleam from the shaded electric light near which she stood her anxious
expression of a few minutes ago seemed entirely to have passed. There was
something Grecian about her beauty, her superbly graceful pose as she stood
there smiling with her eyes fixed upon Mildenhall's.</p>
<p>"You will not be long?" she asked.</p>
<p>"A minute or two only," he promised.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>Patricia led her companion almost in silence across the hall into the
library. Neither of them found speech an easy matter. Mildenhall, curiously
enough, was a little ashamed at the tumult of sensations which had suddenly
disturbed the even progress of his life. Patricia, because of this moment of
deep anxiety for all that she held dear in life, felt an irritated sense of
disquietude of which she also was ashamed. She turned on two of the lights in
the library, motioned him to close the door and listened for a moment. There
were footsteps in the street outside, but not the sort of footsteps for which
she was listening&mdash;wild, undisciplined footsteps these, mostly, of men and
women running, or the shuffling footsteps of the Viennese beggars seeking
always for shelter. What she was dreading was the iron tramp of soldiers, the
voice of discipline, the harsh, raucous commands from an officer of the
invaders.</p>
<p>"I must not keep you long, Mr. Mildenhall," she said. "Please listen. Air.
Benjamin is a strange man. He is the kindest and best person in the world, but
he has queer ideas. He is mortified to-night because you asked to see his
pictures and he could not show them to you."</p>
<p>"But that is ridiculous," Mildenhall told her. "I was sorry afterwards that
I had asked. I do hope he realized that it wasn't idle curiosity."</p>
<p>"He never thought that," she assured him. "It is odd how understanding he
is. He seemed to divine that you were a lover of beautiful things, that you
shared his own taste to some extent."</p>
<p>"It is remarkable that he should have known that," the young man agreed,
"but it is quite true. Most of my leisure time, when I am wandering about
Europe on political affairs, is spent in the picture galleries. I am only an
amateur, of course. My grandfather had a fine collection of Italian
Masters."</p>
<p>"Mr. Benjamin was just saying that he had only been to three private
collections in Europe and it was your uncle's&mdash;I think he said in
Norfolk&mdash;which pleased him best."</p>
<p>"Why are you speaking in the past tense?" he asked her suddenly. "Mr.
Benjamin hasn't gone away, has he?"</p>
<p>"Please don't ask me that," she begged.</p>
<p>"But surely they wouldn't have touched him?"</p>
<p>"What did they do to the Rothschilds?"</p>
<p>"The Rothschilds were more or less politicians," he reminded her. "Our own
Ambassador here has told me that Mr. Benjamin has never taken any part in the
life of the city except to interest himself in every work of philanthropy and
charity of every sort."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that doesn't seem to go for much with Germans. Anyhow, I will
tell you what has happened. That message Mr. Blute brought to-night was
peremptory."</p>
<p>"Who the mischief is Mr. Blute?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Another time," she answered restlessly. "The Baroness is waiting for you
outside. I want to show you something. Come this way, please."</p>
<p>He followed her obediently. She led him into the farthest corner of the room
and through a heavy door into a smaller apartment, also lined to the ceiling
with books but with a desk in a corner and more signs of habitation. In a few
seconds she paused.</p>
<p>"Would you please close your eyes tightly," she begged.</p>
<p>He obeyed at once, raising his hands and pressing them against his eyeballs.
A moment later she passed him. He felt the swish of her gown and caught a whiff
of the perfume of roses. Then she called to him from a few yards away. She was
standing with the handle of a door between her fingers, a door which comprised
a portion of the bookcases themselves. Beyond was what seemed to be a vast
apartment as black as night.</p>
<p>"Come here quickly," she enjoined.</p>
<p>He hurried to her side. She leaned forward and touched an electric switch in
the wall. A few lights shone out in the room, which must have been at least a
hundred and fifty feet long. He stared into its shadows in amazement. Then the
walls themselves disclosed their secret.</p>
<p>"This is the main picture gallery," she whispered. "You see?"</p>
<p>There were plenty of spaces on the walls where pictures had hung, but of
pictures there was not a trace. She looked up into his face.</p>
<p>"You understand now?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I understand," he replied.</p>
<p>She led him back again into the smaller room and passed out of it into the
main library. She was a little breathless and she listened intently before she
spoke.</p>
<p>"Quite half of the most valuable pictures have gone," she said.</p>
<p>"Safely out of Austria?"</p>
<p>There was distress in her eyes as she answered him.</p>
<p>"Not yet. We have sworn that they shall be got out, or Mr. Benjamin would
never have left. He ought to have gone weeks ago. His wife is in Paris. I can't
tell you how wonderful Mr. Blute has been, and how clever, but nothing would
make Mr. Benjamin leave this place until the very last moment. He knows now
that his name is first on the list of the Jews who are to be thrown into
prison. The Nazis may come to-night. Certainly they will be here tomorrow. All
we have to pray for is that he will get away safely."</p>
<p>"Wonderful!" he murmured.</p>
<p>"Mr. Benjamin is a miracle man," Patricia went on. "You will think so if
ever the truth comes out. His enemies will think so when they seize his bank
and go through his books. Now, one thing more and you must go. He left you a
present."</p>
<p>"A present?"</p>
<p>She unlocked a drawer, pushed back a sheet of tissue paper and showed him a
flat volume with gilt edges exquisitely bound in white vellum.</p>
<p>"There were only six of these made," she confided. "It is the
catalogue&mdash;the complete catalogue&mdash;of the pictures, the statuary and
the tapestries. You will realize its importance later on. Mr. Benjamin himself
said it would be one of the world's treasures. It is his recompense to you
because he could not show you his pictures. Take great care of it, Mr.
Mildenhall. It is the last one in this country. Here is a case for it."</p>
<p>She slipped it into a plain brown leather wrapper.</p>
<p>"Now you must go," she insisted. "I have been as quick as I could, but the
Baroness must have been hating me for the last ten minutes!"</p>
<p>"But can't we&mdash;shan't we meet again?" he begged.</p>
<p>"I haven't time to think of anything of that sort just now."</p>
<p>She pushed him very gently towards the door.</p>
<p>"You must go," she went on. "We may meet again somewhere&mdash;sometime. Who
knows&mdash;and does it matter?"</p>
<p>Suddenly he felt that it did matter. That delightful little tremulous mouth
and the sad eyes which looked as though they were really made for laughter and
happiness suddenly seemed to make a new appeal to him.</p>
<p>"Of course it matters," he declared. "To-morrow&mdash;next
day&mdash;anywhere&mdash;at any place."</p>
<p>"I have work to do," she sighed. "It isn't ordinary work. It is sacred.
Until it is finished I have no time for any other thought. Please go."</p>
<p>They had reached the hall. Heinrich came respectfully forward.</p>
<p>"The Baroness is getting very impatient, <i>mein Herr</i>." he said.</p>
<p>Charles Mildenhall held out his hand. Patricia's fingers were like ice.</p>
<p>"Take care of yourself during the next few days," she advised. "Even for
foreigners Vienna will not be a happy place."</p>
<p>"You must tell me&mdash;" he began.</p>
<p>She had suddenly turned away. Her hand was almost snatched from his. He
caught a glimpse of the gathering tears in her eyes. She flew up the great
staircase, slim and wonderfully graceful in those rapid movements.</p>
<p>"You will pardon me, <i>mein Herr</i>," a voice sounded in his ears. "The
Baroness is leaving."</p>
<p>Patricia had disappeared. Mildenhall followed Heinrich to the door.<br>
<br></p>
<p>"I am an angry woman," the Baroness declared, throwing him a portion of the
rug which covered her knees but retiring a little farther into her corner.</p>
<p>"I beg you to excuse me," he said. "Really, the message was quite
important."</p>
<p>"And you have a present," she observed.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Really, of all the men I know you are the most ungallant," she pronounced.
"You go away to flirt with that little girl and leave me here shivering. What
am I to expect from you in the future if you treat me like this so early in our
acquaintance?"</p>
<p>"It is a relief to me to know that there is to be a future," he replied.</p>
<p>"You do not deserve one&mdash;with me."</p>
<p>The rug slipped. He stooped to replace it. Somehow or other their hands came
into collision. He retained his hold upon her fingers.</p>
<p>"How amiable I am!" she sighed. "Why should I allow you to hold my hand when
you have been so rude to me?"</p>
<p>"The greatest privilege a woman possesses is the privilege of forgiving/' he
reminded her.</p>
<p>"That was never written by a writer of romance," she told him. "Forgiveness
should be earned."</p>
<p>"Teach me how to earn it, please."</p>
<p>She sighed again.</p>
<p>"Well," she said, "you must answer every question I ask you."</p>
<p>"I'll do my best."</p>
<p>"What are you doing in Vienna just now?"</p>
<p>"I am on my way back to England."</p>
<p>"Where did you come from?"</p>
<p>"Budapest."</p>
<p>"What did you do there?"</p>
<p>"Wrote and sketched."</p>
<p>"What did you write about?"</p>
<p>"The country."</p>
<p>"What did you sketch&mdash;fortifications?"</p>
<p>"Why fortifications?"</p>
<p>"You are interested in such things," she observed. "You were military
<i>attach&eacute;</i> here once."</p>
<p>"Was I?" he answered. "That must have been the year I suffered from loss of
memory."</p>
<p>"What is in that parcel you have under your arm? If you are going to be rude
I shall not let you hold my hand."</p>
<p>"I like holding your hand and I am certainly not being rude," he told her.
"As regards the parcel, however, it was a present from a lady and the only
condition she made was that I should tell no one I possessed it."</p>
<p>"You will take me to the Von Liebenstrahl ball to-night?"</p>
<p>"But how is that possible?" he asked. "I have only an Embassy card."</p>
<p>"Are you ever going to say 'yes' to anything I ask you?" she demanded.</p>
<p>"Ask me the thing I should like you to and I shall not hesitate."</p>
<p>"You are too glib," she laughed. "You are like all the others. I am tired of
you."</p>
<p>"<i>Infid&egrave;le</i>." he murmured reproachfully.</p>
<p>"But what a man! He charges me with faithlessness!"</p>
<p>"Supposing I ask you a few questions."</p>
<p>"I shall answer you&mdash;truthfully if it pleases me, untruthfully if it
suits me better."</p>
<p>"We make no progress," he complained.</p>
<p>"Along which road do you desire to travel?" she asked.</p>
<p>"The nearest road which leads to your heart, Madame."</p>
<p>"I shall begin to feel aggrieved," she declared. "Your first glance at me
was the sort of glance a woman loves to receive. There was a little admiration
in those rather expressive eyes of yours, there was a little curiosity, there
was a certain amount of&mdash;desire."</p>
<p>"Then they appear to have told you everything," he said, "which my lips are
not yet brave enough to utter."</p>
<p>She moved her head slightly and looked at him.</p>
<p>"Your mouth looks brave enough," she meditated.</p>
<p>"A challenge?"</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>"Not a challenge. An affair of lipstick."</p>
<p>"You have none on your eyes," he said, gazing at them intently.</p>
<p>"There is poison on my eyelashes," she warned him.</p>
<p>He drew a little nearer.</p>
<p>"You are well protected," he complained.</p>
<p>"Something must have told me," she sighed, "that I was going to be driven
home alone by a young man whose tongue, at any rate, was intrepid."</p>
<p>"That certainly is a challenge," he replied, and held her for a moment in
his arms.</p>
<p>"Be sweet to me now," she begged, as she delicately removed herself. "Tell
me what is in that parcel."</p>
<p>"I will tell you what is in my heart. Baroness," he promised, "but I cannot
reveal the contents of this parcel."</p>
<p>"To think," she murmured, "that your lips should dare to misbehave as they
have done and then refuse my simple request! Besides, your offer means nothing.
I know what is in your heart."</p>
<p>"That should be of some assistance to me," he declared hopefully.</p>
<p>"On the contrary, it is fast making of me an icicle. In your heart is the
image of that little red-haired girl who called you away from me and who has
given you a present."</p>
<p>He glanced out of the window and sighed.</p>
<p>"I seem to make but little progress," he grumbled. "Are you really not going
to the Von Liebenstrahl ball?"</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>"Alas," she sighed, "I am not invited. It is well known that I adore Karl,
and the Princess, like your Lady Tremearne at the Embassy, loves the
Archduchess."</p>
<p>He drew a deep sigh of content.</p>
<p>"I suspected it," he said, "but I was not sure. I am feeling happy."</p>
<p>"But why?"</p>
<p>"You adore Karl. My name is Charles."</p>
<p>"You are quite and entirely incorrigible!" she exclaimed. "How could you
possibly imagine that you could take any place in my affections?"</p>
<p>"I am an incurable optimist," he told her. "I expect always to receive
everything that I desire."</p>
<p>"But what vast, what egregious conceit! After going off with that red-headed
girl, too!"</p>
<p>They turned in underneath the broad <i>porte-coch&egrave;re</i> of Sacher's
Hotel.</p>
<p>"But I told you that I must go to the Embassy first to change," he reminded
her.</p>
<p>"Did you? I forgot. You have talked so much nonsense. I remember now,
though, that you said you must call here for your card."</p>
<p>"Quite true," he agreed. "But there is no reason why I should keep you
waiting while I get that&mdash;or, if you like, I can take a taxi to the
Embassy."</p>
<p>"You might find it difficult to find one," she replied. "You have an
apartment here?"</p>
<p>"A small one."</p>
<p>"I will come up and wait in your salon while you get the card," she
proposed. "Ten minutes, Friedrich," she told the chauffeur, as the doorkeeper
stood on one side and Charles handed her out of the limousine.<br>
<br></p>
<p>They found the lounge crowded with eager little groups of men and women.
Everyone was talking excitedly and the air was full of rumours. They reached
the lift with difficulty. Arrived on the fourth floor Charles Mildenhall led
the way to his apartment. The Baroness took possession of an easy chair drawn
up towards the balcony. At her request he opened the high windows.</p>
<p>"You can leave me your present to look at," she proposed, stretching out her
hand, "while you find your card."</p>
<p>"Alas," he told her, "it is impossible. My present is connected with a
secret, and the secret is not mine."</p>
<p>She rose to her feet, flung off her cloak and stood facing him, her hands
resting upon his shoulders.</p>
<p>"My friend," she began, and her eyes were liquid and very, very blue, "how
are we to continue friends if you refuse everything I ask? Come, I will do away
with all the secrecy of your present. I know what it is. That little red-haired
minx with the serpent's eyes has given you the last catalogue that exists of
old Benjamin's great collection. I want to see it. I prayed him for one months
ago. He has never promised, but he very nearly promised. There is no harm in my
looking one through. Remember, I am Beatrice whom for a few minutes you once
admired. Beatrice will be kind to you if you do what she asks."</p>
<p>The beautiful arms hung an inch or two farther over his shoulders. They were
very nearly around his neck. His fingers caressed her hair for a moment. Then
he held her wrists, raised her fingers to his lips and stepped back.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, "I know that my mysterious package contains only the
catalogue of Mr. Benjamin's pictures, but for some reason I know nothing of I
was asked for a promise, and I gave it. You would not have me commence our
friendship by breaking a promise, even if it were to another woman."</p>
<p>There was a cloud over the Baroness' face. One might imagine that she could
be very angry.</p>
<p>"She is not a woman, that secretary," she scoffed. "She is just a little
chit, a working girl. She does not count."</p>
<p>He moved a little farther away. The parcel was under his arm.</p>
<p>"Please be kind," he begged. "I shall be back in five minutes. We might
have, perhaps, some coffee before I go to change."</p>
<p>Her arms dropped to her sides. She stood there quite speechless. Her eyes
followed him to the door. He looked back for a moment. She was still standing
there, her eyes still seeking for his. She said nothing. He hurried into his
room, found the card and locked his parcel securely away in the safe by his
bedside. When he returned the Baroness had gone, the room was empty. The hall
porter sought him out as he was calling for a carriage.</p>
<p>"Madame la Baronne has left, sir," he announced. "She begged me to tell you
that she would send her car back in five minutes. It will be at your
disposition for an hour. Ah, he returns already," the man pointed out.</p>
<p>Charles Mildenhall waited for a moment and slipped a <i>pourboire</i> into
the hand of the chauffeur as he brought the automobile under the
<i>porte-coch&egrave;re</i>.</p>
<p>"Tell your mistress that I send her my grateful thanks but I have no further
use for the car."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>Charles Mildenhall was honoured that night by a long conversation with the
Princess von Liebenstrahl. She stopped him when he would have passed on in the
wake of the Embassy party and, taking advantage of a little lull in the stream
of arriving guests, accepted a chair from him and some coffee from one of the
small army of servants who had been brought down from the
<i>Schloss&gt;</i>.</p>
<p>"I remember you so well, Mr. Mildenhall," she said. "Ah, if only there were
more with your uniform here to-night! If we had still the joy of feeling that
England was our friend! Alas, there seems to be nothing but darkness wherever
we look. My husband is angry with me because he says we betray our cause when
we lose heart, but I feel that Austria is doomed."</p>
<p>"They are bad days indeed. Princess," Mildenhall admitted, "but Austria has
confronted them before and emerged victorious."</p>
<p>"It is the strength of Germany which we fear," the Princess lamented. "It is
coming. I feel it in the air. We shall become a vassal state to our omnipotent
neighbour. It has not happened since the days of Napoleon that the eyes of all
Europe are fixed upon one man."</p>
<p>"Madame," Charles said, "even in these sacred precincts one hesitates to
talk openly. The Nazi spies are everywhere. For that reason we, who follow
diplomacy as a profession, and you, who represent the great ones of your
country have to speak with reserve. Still, I think there is some comfort to be
drawn from the fact that England and France are arming rapidly. For neither of
them could there be any other enemy except one...<i>Monsieur le Prince</i> is
here, I see."</p>
<p>Mildenhall rose to his feet and stood respectfully at attention. The Prince,
a tall, broad-shouldered man with fine features and presence, greeted him with
a smile.</p>
<p>"Only once have we met, my young friend," he reminded Charles, "since you
taught us that the drives in our woods were too few and that my pheasants must
have room to rise before they are worthy of the sportsman's gun. What days
those were!"</p>
<p>"I remember the village folk," the Princess remarked, "gathering on the
hills and the boundaries of the wood to see the Englishmen shoot the pheasants
from the skies."</p>
<p>"The thing which I remember with almost the greatest pleasure," Charles
said, "was the luncheon served in the market-place of the old village. We were
waited upon by the gamekeepers and their wives in that wonderful costume. The
peasants danced for us. We drank wine from huge casks. And then the nights that
followed&mdash;the dinner in your great hall, the dancing, that glorious
mountain air!"</p>
<p>"We shall make ourselves sad if we remember too much," the Prince remarked.
"My dear," he added, offering his arm to his wife, "Her Royal Highness arrives.
We are keeping our young friend from the dance. Later on, Mr. Mildenhall, we
will drink a cup of wine to happier days."</p>
<p>Charles passed on into the ballroom, sought out his party and danced for an
hour or more. The Archduke Karl Sebastian, with whose daughter he had been
dancing, led him to one side. The two stood before one of the great windows
which looked over the city. There were one or two fires to be seen, but the
sound of artillery had decreased.</p>
<p>"Is there any news to-night," the Archduke enquired.</p>
<p>"Nothing special," Mildenhall replied. "I am not formally attached to the
Embassy now so I have not seen any of the code messages, but I believe most of
the telegraph wires are cut between here and the northern frontier and there
are rumours that the internal railways have been commandeered."</p>
<p>"Any news of my friend Benjamin? That is a person for whom I am most
anxious."</p>
<p>Charles looked around cautiously. Notwithstanding the great crowd, their
corner was almost empty.</p>
<p>"I dined with him at his wonderful house tonight," he confided. "It was not
a party. I met him in his bank and he asked me to come several days ago. He
looked well but I fancy he was continually receiving disturbing messages."</p>
<p>"The times have changed," the Archduke murmured. "In the old days, when
there was an uprising like this amongst the nations, it was the aristocrats who
went shivering for their lives. Now it is the Jews. A senseless, ignorant,
cruel persecution, it seems to me. Leopold Benjamin is a great man and a great
gentleman. He has done more for Vienna than any-other citizen, yet they tell me
if the Nazis get hold of him it will probably mean assassination and the
confiscation of all his treasures. My heart has been in my own country home, in
my own mountains and forests since 1918, but Vienna still means much to me. I
know that Benjamin has parted with more than a million pounds to charities
during the last twenty years. I would sit at his table with pleasure if he
invited me."</p>
<p>"I am afraid it will be a long time before he entertains again in Vienna,"
Charles sighed. "It was almost a home party to-night and there wasn't anyone
there who wasn't anxious to have him cross the frontier. Mr. Benjamin was
called away towards the end of the meal. He did not reappear."</p>
<p>The Archduke nodded understandingly.</p>
<p>"My wife and I are leaving in a few days," he said. "We have relatives in
Italy, but I ask myself how we should be received in France."</p>
<p>"France is always a gracious country," Charles reflected. "There is Egypt,
too...Here is my friend Lascelles. He looks as though he might have news."</p>
<p>"A message from His Excellency," the latter announced as he joined them.
"You excuse me, sir?" he added, turning to the Archduke.</p>
<p>"Certainly."</p>
<p>"It is no longer a secret," Lascelles continued. "The Germans have crossed
the frontier and are marching upon Vienna. There is no resistance, but in face
of the disturbed condition everywhere we are ordered to quit. We have a special
train at eight o'clock this morning, Charles. His Excellency wants to know if
you will join us. He thinks that there may be considerable delay if you stay on
here."</p>
<p>"Join you? Why, rather!" Mildenhall agreed. "I'll get round to the hotel and
pack."</p>
<p>"Eight o'clock at the Western Station."<br>
<br></p>
<p>For the first half hour after his arrival at the hotel Mildenhall set the
valet to work packing and occupied himself in sorting and destroying the few
papers he possessed of any importance. As soon as he had finished his task he
rose and went to the safe which was set into the wall by the side of his bed.
He unlocked it and swung back the door. For a moment or two he stood
motionless. Then he called the valet.</p>
<p>"Fritz," he said, "there was a parcel in this safe when I left for the ball
this evening."</p>
<p>"A parcel, sir?"</p>
<p>"A leather case. Inside there was a book."</p>
<p>The man shook his head.</p>
<p>"I've never seen such a thing, sir," he replied. "You probably remember,
sir, that you gave me the evening off."</p>
<p>"Quite right. When you came back were there any signs of anyone having been
here?"</p>
<p>"None, sir."</p>
<p>Charles made no further remark. Fie took the packets of money which were the
sole contents of the safe and relocked it.</p>
<p>"I'm going out for an hour, Fritz," he said. "Get on with the packing. Leave
me out a lounge suit and an overcoat. You can send my uniform round to the
Embassy later on. I shall be back in plenty of time to change."</p>
<p>"Very good, sir. I'm sorry about the parcel."</p>
<p>"My mistake, perhaps, Fritz. I'm not blaming you in any way."</p>
<p>On his way out he stopped at the bureau. The reception clerk hurried up to
him.</p>
<p>"Tell me," Charles asked, "has anyone called to see me to-night whilst I was
out?"</p>
<p>The man smiled. He leaned a little farther across the counter.</p>
<p>"Only the lady who was with you when you went upstairs this evening, sir,"
he confided. "She came back about an hour after you had left for the
Embassy."</p>
<p>"She came back?" Charles repeated thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"She asked for the keys of your room, sir. I hope I was right in giving them
to her?"</p>
<p>"Of course. Did she return them to you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. She was only upstairs for about a quarter of an hour. She said
she hoped to see you later."</p>
<p>Mildenhall nodded and turned away. He spent a few minutes in the telephone
box, stepped outside, ordered a taxi and drove to a small block of apartment
flats on the other side of the Ringstrasse. He leaned across the counter to the
sleepy <i>concierge</i>.</p>
<p>"The Baroness von Ballinstrode," he whispered confidentially. "She is
expecting me."</p>
<p>The man rubbed his eyes, gazed in awe at Mildenhall's uniform and handed him
the keys. The yawning lift boy took him up to the third floor. He opened the
door of the number on the keys softly and found himself in a small hall. He
passed through another door and entered a delightful little sitting-room half
filled with roses. The door of the bedroom leading from it was wide open.
Before an elegantly shaped oval mirror the Baroness was seated in the most
negligible of negliges. Her golden hair in a long stream hung over the back of
her chair. A dark complexioned Viennese maid was brushing it with intense care.
It was not until Mildenhall had advanced half-a-dozen paces that they were
aware of his presence. The maid screamed and dropped the brush. The Baroness
sat for a moment as though turned to stone. Then she sprang to her feet,
wrapped her diaphanous dressing-gown a little more closely around her and came
forward with outstretched hands.</p>
<p>"But, my friend!" she cried. "This is marvellous!"</p>
<p>He stood motionless. She came fearlessly up to him. Her expression was a
curious mixture of fear and joy. Her eyes questioned him feverishly.</p>
<p>"Where have you come from?" she demanded.</p>
<p>"From the ball."</p>
<p>She suddenly realized that he was unresponsive. The eyes that met hers were
hard.</p>
<p>"You have come direct here?" she asked.</p>
<p>"No," he answered. "I called at the hotel."</p>
<p>She turned round and closed the door behind her.</p>
<p>Then she flung herself on to a small divan and lay back amongst the
cushions, her fingers clasped behind her head.</p>
<p>"You are angry with me, Charles," she said.</p>
<p>"Yes," he replied. "I am angry with you. There is little time to spare. Give
me that book."</p>
<p>"Why do you say there is little time to spare?" she demanded. "The morning
is young. We have many hours. There is wine on the sideboard there. Give me
some and serve yourself. We must not quarrel, Charles."</p>
<p>Her voice was a caress but its sweetness was wasted upon him.</p>
<p>"Baroness&mdash;" he began.</p>
<p>"Beatrice," she interrupted.</p>
<p>"Beatrice, then," he continued. "I want my book."</p>
<p>"Why do you think that I have your book?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Because they told me at the hotel that you had been there and asked for my
keys, which they were foolish enough to give you. Afterwards you apparently
helped yourself to the book which was in my safe and returned with it here. You
have exactly five minutes to hand it over."</p>
<p>"Why only five minutes?" she asked. "You are very handsome in that uniform,
Charles, but you are very stiff and unbending. Loosen that high collar and sit
down by my side. I will explain to you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I desire no explanation," he broke in. "I must have the book."</p>
<p>"You are very foolish, Charles," she whispered. "The book is
beautiful&mdash;but so am I."</p>
<p>"You are far more beautiful than any book could be," he assented, "but
nevertheless, the book is mine and I demand it. You have now a matter of three
minutes left in which to restore it."</p>
<p>She laughed gaily. Then for a moment she was silent. Her eyes were fixed
upon his. She held out her arms. Her voice was lower still.</p>
<p>"If I am more beautiful than the book," she murmured, "take me instead."</p>
<p>"Beatrice," he answered, "you are as beautiful as an angel and the book is a
dull thing of parchment and vellum, but we are not engaged in a battle of
flowery words just now. I am in deadly earnest. That book I demand and must
have. You have two minutes left."</p>
<p>She raised herself a little upon the divan.</p>
<p>"Why do you harp so upon the time, darling? We have many hours
together&mdash;if you will. I am alone. If your thoughts are with your
namesake&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Baroness, my thoughts are upon myself and my own safety," he interrupted.
"Is it still the custom in Vienna to fight duels in a lady's salon?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" she demanded. "Ah, I can guess! Stupid!
Monsieur&mdash;you think of him. It is arranged so that he does not come. You
heard me say it. The hours are free and your book&mdash;if you must have
it&mdash;may come into your possession a little later on."</p>
<p>"You have exactly one minute left. Baroness," he told her. "As to the
movements of my distinguished namesake, you are wrong. Events have changed all
that. The Archduchess has received an invitation to leave on the special train
with Lady Tremearne for London. Her husband remains here."</p>
<p>She was on her feet now.</p>
<p>"What you tell me is the truth?"</p>
<p>"On my honour it is the truth."</p>
<p>"Then you must fly," she cried. "Do not hesitate for a moment. Karl has a
terrible temper. You have heard stories of what has already happened.
Please&mdash;please&mdash;my friend, I implore you&mdash;go!" For the first
time the glimmering of a smile parted his lips.</p>
<p>"No," he said, "I am in no hurry. If a duel must be fought, if there is to
be a violent scene, I will take my share in it. You spoke of a glass of wine.
It is an idea."</p>
<p>He took one step towards the sideboard.</p>
<p>"Don't touch anything!" she cried. "Wait!"</p>
<p>She disappeared&mdash;a flash of fluttering ribbons and whirling
draperies&mdash;through the door of her bedchamber. In a few seconds she was
back. The parcel was there. She thrust it into his hands.</p>
<p>"Charles," she begged, "forgive me. For your life&mdash;hurry! For your life
and mine! He will kill us both."</p>
<p>Charles tucked the book securely under his arm. He kissed her
fingers&mdash;suddenly cold&mdash;then he moved towards the door. From the
threshold he looked back. She was standing there shivering, still beautiful,
waving him passionately away.</p>
<p>"Calm yourself, dear Beatrice," he cried. "The Archduchess refused Her
Ladyship's invitation. Take my advice&mdash;a glass of wine quickly to restore
you. <i>Au revoir</i>!"</p>
<p>He closed the door. Down the stairs, it is true, he moved swiftly. He
stepped into his taxi.</p>
<p>"The Sacher Hotel!" he ordered.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>Seventeen months and twenty-four days later Charles Mildenhall, weary to
death of trans-European railways, of shouting and gesticulating crowds,
unwashed for two days, with parched throat and the smell of all evil things in
his nostrils, sat upon the porter's luggage barrow in the great railway station
of Vienna and succeeded in achieving a state of utter disgust and weariness of
life. He had been four days on a twenty-four hour journey, leaving behind him a
commandeered car. He had stood in queues&mdash;a thing he loathed&mdash;he had
had to make fairy-tale explanations of his business and his passport to a dozen
unsympathetic officials rather than tell them the truth. He had reached Vienna
in the gloom of a stormy evening to find not a taxicab at the station, not a
single bowing commissionaire from any of the hotels, not a friendly face or a
smile to be seen amongst the great cosmopolitan crowd who were pushing,
apparently aimlessly, in every direction. Then, just as he sat up in despair to
look out once more up and down the broad empty thoroughfare leading from the
station, he beheld a wonderful sight and heard a wonderful sound. He saw a
rather antiquated but a solid and veritable taxicab drawing up a few yards from
the kerb-stone of the pavement and he heard what was far more wonderful
still&mdash;a familiar voice. With his hand holding his cap raised high above
his head, his countenance wreathed in one huge grin of welcome, was his
ex-valet from the Embassy!</p>
<p>"Fritz!" he gasped.</p>
<p>"<i>Mein Herr</i>!" the little man exclaimed, only to wander off a minute
later into a stream of mispronounced English. "What a joy! I am very happy. It
is Herr Mildenhall."</p>
<p>"The remains of him," Charles uttered mournfully, rising to his feet.
"Fritz, the sight of you has saved my life. I am worn out. I am hungry. I am
thirsty. I am penniless. Take my dressing case, take my small bag, help me into
your heaven-directed vehicle."</p>
<p>Fritz leaped lightly off the box and did everything he was told.</p>
<p>"<i>Ach</i>, it is many, many months since I saw you last," he cried.
"Vienna is a rubbish heap. We are all starving. Where does Monsieur wish to
drive?"</p>
<p>"What a joyous sound is your voice, Fritz!" Charles exclaimed. "Is there by
any chance a hostelry open in this melancholy city?"</p>
<p>"The Sacher," Fritz replied. "One wing is closed, the rest remains."</p>
<p>"The Sacher!" Charles repeated as though in a dream of frenzied joy. "The
Sacher by all means. But do not leave me when we get there, Fritz. I shall need
you for a dozen things. I must have news of the place. I buy you&mdash;you and
your vehicle&mdash;from this moment for the duration of my visit."</p>
<p>"Thank God for that, sir!" Fritz said gratefully. "It is to be hoped <i>mein
Herr</i> has enough money for his fare. If not, it is equal to me but there
will be a tax owing to the hall porter&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Have no fear," was the joyous interruption. "I'll arrange all that. Let's
get along."</p>
<p>They drove off. Charles lolled back against the cushions with a little groan
of content. For two nights his head had rested on a wooden pillow. With every
turn of the wheels the little vehicle seemed to be passing into the richer
quarters of the city. There were more lights already. The fronts of many of the
shops were barricaded with sandbags but here and there an open one invited
customers. The line of caf&eacute;s commenced, the lights of the Ringstrasse
glowed feebly in their magic circle. There were men and women in the streets,
crawling about, it is true, but civilized people. Marvellous! They drove up to
the hotel and a porter stepped out for the luggage. Charles stumbled from the
cab.</p>
<p>"Draw up and wait a minute, Fritz," he ordered. "I will be with you
directly."</p>
<p>He walked to the cashier's office. What joy! A familiar face was there, a
familiar smile, the same deeply respectful bow.</p>
<p>"It is Herr Mildenhall!" the man exclaimed. "Welcome, <i>mein Herr</i>. We
have money for you."</p>
<p>"Thank God!" was all that Charles could say at that moment.</p>
<p>"What will you have, <i>mein Herr</i>?" the cashier asked. "There is money
from England, money from Budapest and money from the <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i>."</p>
<p>"Give me some local money and fifty pounds in English notes."</p>
<p>The clerk leaned across the desk.</p>
<p>"I would beg you, sir, not to display this too freely," he said. "There is
very little money in Vienna just now. Here is Mr. Herodin to ask what apartment
he can give you."</p>
<p>"A suite on the first floor," Charles ordered, welcoming the manager with
joy. "Mr. Herodin, I am glad to see you. I have not changed my linen or washed
for days! I have not drunk a glass of wine or smoked a cigarette for a week!
You have a trunk of mine here. Let it be unpacked&mdash;set a valet to work at
once. Let a waiter provide a meal, a bottle of wine&mdash;in my sitting-room.
Do not be alarmed if I bring my taxicab driver up with me. He was my valet when
I was last here."</p>
<p>"Suite number seventeen, Herr Mildenhall. I will set the quickest servants
we have to work," the manager promised. "Dinner will be served before you are
out of your bath. We have rooms, we have food, we have wine. What we need are
clients. The hotel is almost empty."</p>
<p>"In a few moments," Charles promised, "I will denude your larders and empty
your cellars."</p>
<p>He returned to the entrance. He poured small change into Fritz's hand for
the taxi drive. He tipped the hall porter. He tipped the porters who were
guarding his luggage. He turned back to the stupefied Fritz, who was gazing at
his handful of silver.</p>
<p>"There is enough there?" Charles asked him.</p>
<p>"<i>Gn&atilde;diger Herr</i>," Fritz replied, "this money would buy the
taxicab and me! I am not sure that it would not buy the hotel!"</p>
<p>"Listen," Charles went on. "Park the taxicab anywhere, go and sit down at a
caf&eacute;&mdash;eat, drink moderately, but eat, man! You look half starved.
Then come back here to-morrow morning at ten o'clock. Suite number seventeen.
Come up to me&mdash;suite seventeen."</p>
<p>There was joy mingled with a pitiful anxiety upon the man's face.</p>
<p>"Herr Mildenhall," he stammered. "You remember Suzette, my wife? She is
starving, too."</p>
<p>"Fetch her, you idiot!" Charles cried. "Drive away in your taxi and fetch
her wherever she is. Take her to the caf&eacute;. Eat and drink&mdash;both of
you. Here&mdash;take some more money."</p>
<p>Fritz stepped back and shook his head.</p>
<p>"<i>Mein Herr</i>," he confided, "I could buy the caf&eacute; we go to with
this."</p>
<p>"Go to a better one, then."</p>
<p>"Oh, we shall eat, I promise you," the man declared with tears in his eyes.
"We will eat and we will drink and I will be here at ten in the
morning&mdash;do not fear. One has not prayed for deliverance all this time in
vain," he added as he stumbled into his seat.</p>
<p>For a moment Charles forgot his own discomfort. He watched Fritz drive
off.</p>
<p>"There are many like that?" he asked the hall porter.</p>
<p>"The city is full of them, sir," was the doleful reply. "It is hard enough
for those who have kept their posts. Our wages are reduced, the price of food
has gone up, there is no coal and little wood. Life is very difficult.
Everything that we have the Germans take. I think that they wish to get rid of
the Austrians and they have decided that the quickest way is to starve them.
Now they tell me we are to go to war again."</p>
<p>Charles hurried away with a word of sympathy. He slipped into the lift,
where a pert young Viennese lady with flashing eyes languished at him in vain.
In a moment or two he was in number seventeen. He drew a long sigh of deep
content at the comfort and luxury with which he was surrounded. One valet was
waiting to strip off his clothes, another was testing the warmth of the bath.
The trunk he had left there had been fetched up and opened. Fresh silk
underwear and fresh linen were already laid out. He plunged into the bath with
a groan of happiness. He sank in it up to his neck, stretched out his hands for
the sponge and the soap. A sensation of amazing and voluptuous content crept
over him. He closed his eyes...When he awoke only one of the valets was
left.</p>
<p>"Have I been asleep?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Only for a few minutes, sir," the servant answered.</p>
<p>"Is Frederick still in the bar?"</p>
<p>"I believe so, sir."</p>
<p>"Telephone down for two dry Martinis. See that they are sent up in the
shaker&mdash;absolutely cold and the proper glass."</p>
<p>"I'll telephone down, sir."</p>
<p>"A debauch of luxury," Charles murmured to himself a little later as he
finished shaving and eyed his second cocktail greedily. "What has become of my
dinner?"</p>
<p>"The waiter brought the first course up, sir, but we sent it back in case
you slept longer. I stayed here to see that you did not slip down in the bath
and Franz here is unpacking the trunk and your small things and preparing your
evening clothes."</p>
<p>"What time is it?"</p>
<p>"Eight o'clock, sir."</p>
<p>"I'll dine in the restaurant," Charles decided. "I can't go to sleep at the
table, anyhow. I shall come straight to bed afterwards."</p>
<p>The man's face was a little grave as he bowed.</p>
<p>"What's the matter&mdash;the restaurant is open, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"Most certainly, sir. The restaurant is open. There is
dancing&mdash;Mademoiselle Celeste from Sweden, she makes very beautiful
gymnastic dance."</p>
<p>"Capital! Tell the head-waiter to keep me a corner table against the wall
somewhere."</p>
<p>"Certainly, <i>mein Herr</i>."</p>
<p>Charles completed his toilet, sipped his cocktail and lit a cigarette. There
was a knock at the door. Mr. Herodin entered. He smiled at the
transformation.</p>
<p>"You are feeling a different man, Herr Mildenhall?" he enquired.</p>
<p>"And looking one, too, I hope!"</p>
<p>The manager waved the servants away.</p>
<p>"You are doing us the honour, I believe, of dining in the restaurant,
sir?"</p>
<p>"I thought I would," Charles acquiesced. "It will be a treat to see some
civilized people again."</p>
<p>"I fear, sir, that you will see very few of them," Herodin confided. "The
fact of it is that our clients have momentarily deserted us."</p>
<p>Charles nodded and waited for more.</p>
<p>"The people who come here," the man went on, "are chiefly German Nazis. They
are not very polite, they give a great deal of trouble and they are not so
particular in their dress and uniform as the Viennese&mdash;added to which
their behaviour is rude."</p>
<p>"I understand. Anyhow, I'm much too sleepy to talk to anyone, much less
quarrel with them."</p>
<p>The manager sighed.</p>
<p>"It is sad," he said, "but one by one my regular clients have deserted me.
The Archduke Karl Sebastian was often here; Count Pilduski with the Countess;
Monsieur and Madame de Kruiten, and always some of the younger gentlemen from
the Embassies when they were going. And now&mdash;no one. I thought it better
just to give you a word of warning."</p>
<p>"Very kind of you," Charles acknowledged. "As a matter of curiosity I must
have a look at them, though. Is anyone in possession of the British
Embassy?"</p>
<p>"It seems to us, sir, to be in a state of chaos," Herodin answered. "Mr.
Porter is there for urgent enquiries. He was Consul General, I think, before
the Embassy began to break up. Did you bring any news, sir? Do you think that
there will be war?"</p>
<p>"If there is it will be a very foolish war," Charles replied. "But no one
can tell."</p>
<p>"You will find such English papers as we have received during the past week
on your table in the restaurant, sir," the <i>h&ocirc;telier</i> announced.
"There is no late news, but one understands that the German mobilization on
Poland's frontier is a very grave affair."</p>
<p>Charles finished his cocktail and moved towards the door. He bade the
manager good night at the lift.</p>
<p>"I go now to discover," he said, "whether your chef's <i>Wiener
Schnitzel</i> is as wonderful as ever."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>Charles Mildenhall, having been as near starvation during the past four days
as he was ever likely to be, found his dinner excellent, the wine, personally
vouched for by Mr. Herodin, of the best year and in perfect condition. The
manager's warning, however, concerning the company, was fully justified. There
were one or two small groups of German officers who kept carefully to
themselves and whose bearing was almost offensive. It was curious to notice how
the few Austrians dining there, especially those with their womenkind, took
care to remain on the other side of the room. One woman, who was dining alone,
Charles recognized, and towards the end of dinner, at her request brought by a
waiter, he went and sat with her for coffee. She dropped her heavy monocle at
his approach and beamed up at him with a ready greeting.</p>
<p>"I was afraid that you might not recognize me, Mr. Mildenhall," she said.
"We dined together, you know, at Mr. Leopold Benjamin's some time ago&mdash;on
the night of his disappearance. I am the Princess Sophie von Dorlingen."</p>
<p>"I remember you perfectly. Princess," Charles assured her as he took the
chair the waiter had drawn out for him. "I scarcely flattered myself that you
would remember me, however. We were seated some distance apart at that
memorable dinner and I had not the pleasure of much conversation with you."</p>
<p>She shook her head ponderously.</p>
<p>"It is so sad, this," she continued in her rather guttural voice. "So sad
about Mr. Benjamin."</p>
<p>"Tell me," he begged. "I have been away for so long travelling that I really
seem to have had but little news. Nothing has happened to him, I hope?"</p>
<p>The Princess rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"Rumours, my young friend," she sighed. "Rumours&mdash;many of them. All
bad. Some of them we hope not true. But you can see for yourself his beautiful
house, the bank&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I only arrived here a couple of hours ago," Charles confided. "I've had a
roughish journey down from Poland. I drove straight to the hotel and I have
spent most of my time since changing."</p>
<p>She raised her hands.</p>
<p>"The bank is closed," she told him. "There are boards across the windows. As
for the house&mdash;it is a wreck."</p>
<p>"And the picture galleries&mdash;the museum?" he asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>"There are all manner of stories," she went on, "but one thing is certain.
Within an hour of the German invasion of Vienna a picked band of Nazis went
straight to the house. They demanded to be shown to the picture galleries. They
were stripped! There was not a picture upon the walls. Everything was gone. The
museum was empty. The Nazis were in such a fury that they wanted to burn the
house down. Since then there have been no end of stories. This much is true, at
any rate&mdash;Mr. Leopold Benjamin was a much cleverer man than people
believed. The bank vaults were almost empty. What has become of his possessions
no one knows. The Nazis declare, though, that the pictures and a great many of
the curios are still in the city. There are people who believe that Mr.
Benjamin himself is still in Vienna. You and I know that he was at his house
just before Hitler's Nazis swept through the place."</p>
<p>"I sincerely trust that he got away," Charles said earnestly. "Surely we
would have heard of it if anything had happened to him?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," she answered with doleful pessimism. "Terrible things have
been done here, and from the moment they entered the city the Nazis took
control of all the newspapers. Then there was that sweet young lady&mdash;Mr.
Benjamin's secretary. They say she was marched off to prison."</p>
<p>"Princess!" he exclaimed in a tone of horror.</p>
<p>"It is true," she assured him. "I believe that the American Minister went to
her rescue but that they were furious at having to let her go. I am not sure
that they did not arrest her again later on. Let me see&mdash;she sat next to
you at dinner."</p>
<p>"I sat between her and the Baroness von Ballinstrode. The Baroness was
attractive, of course, in her way, but one meets that type in the civilized
places all over Europe. Miss Grey had a queer Watteau-like grace of movement
and figure, and a wonderful smile. I am not a very impressionable person,
Princess, but I don't mind confessing that I have thought of her more often and
with more pleasure than any of these famous beauties."</p>
<p>"She was, indeed, very charming," the Princess agreed. "Beatrice von
Ballinstrode, of course, I knew much better, but of the two I would much rather
trust the little lady you were speaking of. They both seem to have disappeared
now. Oh, it is a sad place, this Vienna, Mr. Mildenhall! My life&mdash;what has
it become? I was born in a palace. I live now in four rooms with a maid, almost
as old as myself, to look after me. She cannot cook. Three times a week I come
here and I eat&mdash;sometimes a <i>mittagessen</i>, sometimes a dinner. Seldom
do I see any of my friends. To-night I have been lucky. I used to see you
sometimes, Mr. Mildenhall, at the Embassy parties. You are like a shadow from
the old times, anyway. It has done me good to talk to you. Now, outside, in a
few moments you will see an old woman, fatter than I am, in a black dress, a
white apron and a shawl around her head. That is my maid Madeline. We shall
hobble home together."</p>
<p>"If I stay long enough," Charles proposed, "you must dine with me one night,
Princess."</p>
<p>"You will not stay," she sighed. "There is war in the air, more terror that
is coming. I can scent it, almost I can smell it. Austria is full of German
troops. In a few nights you will hear the tramp of feet, the roaring of planes,
the shrieking of locomotive whistles. They will be off then to the north. A
million or two more lives, rivers of blood, all for the lustful joy of one
man."</p>
<p>"The war may still not come," he reminded her.</p>
<p>"If you really think that, all I can say is that I see the future more
clearly than you," she said.</p>
<p>"We should have hope, at any rate," he declared. "I do not often talk of my
missions. Princess, but I will tell you this. I have talked with the fighting
men of Poland within the last ten days. I was on a special and a secret
mission. It is over now. There is no secret about it any longer. I went to tell
them frankly that England and France both recognize their responsibility in
their guarantees to her, but though the guarantees would hold, time would not
stand still. My mission was to beg them to count up their resources, to ask
them whether they could maintain the defence of their country long enough for
us to reach her. They only laughed at me. They are full of confidence, but I
feel they over-estimate the value of bravery against science. They laughed at
the idea of Germany's facing a declaration of war from England and France!"</p>
<p>"So do I," the Princess agreed. "In my saner moments I, too, feel the same
way."</p>
<p>"It is always," he ventured with a smile as he followed her example and rose
to his feet, "the women who are the bravest."</p>
<p>He accompanied her to the door, handed her over to her strange escort, then
he returned to his own table. He sipped his brandy thoughtfully. What he had
half expected happened. One of the little group of German officers seated at a
round table whose attention, for the past quarter-of-an-hour, seemed to have
been focused upon him rose to his feet. He crossed the room and came to a
standstill before Mildenhall's table. He was a young man with closely cropped
hair and the pink and white complexion of a boy. He had an immovable eyeglass
and his manner was not ingratiating.</p>
<p>"I have the honour to address Mr. Charles Mildenhall?" he enquired
frigidly.</p>
<p>Charles eyed him with some surprise.</p>
<p>"You have the advantage of me, sir," he said.</p>
<p>"I am Lieutenant von Hessen of the Third Army Corps, now quartered in
Vienna. The Commanding Officer of my regiment desires a few words with
you."</p>
<p>"I am at his disposition," was the quiet reply.</p>
<p>The young officer hesitated.</p>
<p>"My C.O. then will await your coming," he said.</p>
<p>"Wait one moment," Charles begged. "I said that I was at the disposition of
your C.O. <i>here</i>."</p>
<p>"Are you a British officer?" the lieutenant asked a little arrogantly.</p>
<p>"Certainly."</p>
<p>"It is a peculiar habit you English have," he complained. "On the eve of war
you discard your uniforms. May I enquire your rank?"</p>
<p>Mildenhall produced his pocketbook, drew out a card and handed it to his
questioner. The latter read it out thoughtfully:</p>
<blockquote>"'Major the Hon. Charles d'Arcy Mildenhall. Dragoon
Guards.'</blockquote>
<p>"You will permit me?" the young man added with some reluctance. "I will
present your card to Major von Metternich."</p>
<p>He recrossed the room and leaned down to speak to his senior officer.
Charles measured with his eye the distance between the table at which he had
been seated with the Princess and the one occupied by the officers. It was
absolutely impossible that they should have been able to overhear a word of his
conversation. He waited with equanimity for what might happen. Presently a
tall, broad-shouldered man with the Swastika a prominent embellishment of his
uniform came across the room and addressed him. His manner was stiff but
agreeable.</p>
<p>"May I have a few minutes' conversation with you, Major Mildenhall? I am
Major von Metternich of the Third Army Corps."</p>
<p>"With pleasure," Charles replied. "Pray sit down."</p>
<p>The Major seated himself and toyed with his miniature moustache for a moment
or two. He spoke excellent English but he did not seem altogether at his
ease.</p>
<p>"The matter which I wish to discuss with you, Major, is not altogether a
military one," he confessed. "It is in a sense passed on to us from our
Intelligence Department. It concerns the disappearance of a well-known Jewish
banker and financier from his house and bank here in Vienna."</p>
<p>"Mr. Leopold Benjamin?" Charles ventured.</p>
<p>"Precisely. It appears that just before our <i>F&uuml;hrer</i> decided to
rescue these poor people and draw them into the Reich, Mr. Benjamin gave a
small dinner party at his house. From that dinner party he disappeared."</p>
<p>Charles nodded thoughtfully. He said nothing.</p>
<p>"In the course of my investigations," the Major continued, "I received a
list of the guests who were present. Your name was amongst them."</p>
<p>"That is quite probable," Charles assented. "I was present."</p>
<p>"I have had an opportunity," the Major went on, "of questioning most of the
other guests&mdash;I or someone representing our Intelligence Corps. Not one of
them was able to give me the slightest clue as to Mr. Benjamin's probable
whereabouts."</p>
<p>"I am sorry to hear it," Charles replied. "I was going to call at the bank
to-morrow morning."</p>
<p>"I am afraid," the other observed, "you would find that a waste of time. The
bank has ceased to operate."</p>
<p>"Bad luck," Charles remarked carelessly. "My visit was of no importance,
however. Just a slight matter of business."</p>
<p>"Mr. Benjamin is not, to our knowledge, engaged in any business in Vienna at
the present moment," the Major said. "He is a member of a race which is
entirely out of favour with our <i>F&uuml;hrer</i>. He is a Jew."</p>
<p>"I think everyone in Europe knows that," Charles smiled. "However, if he is
no longer in business I must find the small amount of money I need somewhere
else."</p>
<p>"That is an easy matter for you, no doubt, Major. With our Intelligence
Department, which I represent, it is a different matter. Mr. Benjamin is
heavily in our debt. It seems highly improbable that he has left the country
and the department is determined to find him."</p>
<p>"That he should be heavily in debt to your country astonishes me," Charles
observed.</p>
<p>"He owes," Major von Metternich confided, "a very large sum for unpaid
taxes. The Treasury of the Reich has decided that if he should show any
indisposition to pay, it would be necessary to seize his great collection of
pictures and other <i>objects d'art</i>. They have been famous throughout
Europe for many years."</p>
<p>"Quite true."</p>
<p>"You have seen them, without a doubt?"</p>
<p>"Never," Charles replied. "I was to have seen them, I believe, the night of
the dinner party of which you speak and from which Mr. Benjamin was summoned
away."</p>
<p>"Did you ask to see them on that occasion?"</p>
<p>Charles's eyebrows went slowly up.</p>
<p>"You must excuse me. Major von Metternich," he said, "but you seem to be
cross-examining me on a purely private matter."</p>
<p>"This is a friendly conversation," was the irritated reply. "If you cannot
regard it in that light it may be necessary for me to pass the affair on to
another tribunal."</p>
<p>"Is that a threat?"</p>
<p>"You may accept it as such, if you like."</p>
<p>Charles considered the matter for a moment quietly.</p>
<p>"I will tell you all that I know about the Benjamin collection," he
proposed.</p>
<p>"That is all I can expect, Major," was the somewhat mollified response.</p>
<p>"My request to see the pictures," Mildenhall told his companion, "was
received as quite an ordinary one, but, to be frank with you, there was a sense
of excitement and unrest at that dinner party which I suppose was due to the
fact that Vienna was at any moment expecting the arrival of your invading army.
Towards the end of dinner Mr. Benjamin received a message and left the room. A
short time afterwards word came that he had been called away. I left at once.
So did most of the other guests. As soon as it was daylight I continued my
journey."</p>
<p>"To England?"</p>
<p>"To England. I had stayed over for the Princess von Liebenstrahl's ball that
night."</p>
<p>"And you have not seen Mr. Benjamin since?"</p>
<p>"I have not seen him since."</p>
<p>"Nor any of his household or family?"</p>
<p>"Nor any of his household or family."</p>
<p>"In that case, Major, it does not seem that you are going to be very much
use to us," the Nazi remarked.</p>
<p>"Not the slightest," Charles agreed.</p>
<p>"You stay long in Vienna?"</p>
<p>Charles smiled.</p>
<p>"I am rather feeling the instinct of the homing pigeon," he confided.</p>
<p>Major von Metternich smiled grimly, then he rose to his feet.</p>
<p>"You are without a home here for the moment," he observed.</p>
<p>"I was not officially connected with the Embassy on my last visit," Charles
explained. "I am staying here in the hotel. This time also I am on my way back
to England."</p>
<p>"It remains for me to wish you a pleasant journey," the Major said with a
bow.</p>
<p>"I thank you," Charles answered with equal politeness.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>Soon after ten o'clock that night Charles Mildenhall suddenly realized that
he was half dead with sleepiness and fatigue. He mounted to his rooms, rang for
the valet and in a quarter-of-an-hour was in bed. Twelve hours later he awoke
to find Herodin, frock-coated, smiling, the perfect <i>h&ocirc;telier</i>,
standing by his side. He bowed apologetically.</p>
<p>"Mr. Mildenhall," he said, "the floor waiter reported that you gave no
orders for calling."</p>
<p>"Quite right," Charles replied, sitting up in bed. "I was dead tired. This
morning I am rested. If you will be so good as to send the valet to turn on my
bath, and the waiter?"</p>
<p>"With pleasure, Mr. Mildenhall. I ventured to come up myself this morning
because I thought that you would like to know that the news looks slightly
better. The <i>F&uuml;hrer</i> has consented to receive an emissary from
Poland. It will at least mean a few more days' delay."</p>
<p>"Excellent!" Charles exclaimed, rubbing his eyes.</p>
<p>"There is also," Herodin continued, "the very shabby taxicab in which you
arrived last night."</p>
<p>"The chauffeur is to wait," Charles replied. "It would be a kindness, Mr.
Herodin, if you could send him round to the back and supply him with coffee and
anything else he wants. He is an old friend, once valet at the Embassy. I
picked him up at the station on my arrival and have engaged him for my few days
here."</p>
<p>"It is a very gracious action," Herodin murmured.</p>
<p>Charles Mildenhall was of an age when nature speedily reasserts itself. He
drank his coffee, then he sent down for Fritz, who presently arrived already a
different person and dressed in an entirely new suit of clothes.</p>
<p>"Feeling better, Fritz?" his patron enquired.</p>
<p>The chauffeur grinned.</p>
<p>"And the wife, sir," he replied. "Food and wine, they do make a difference.
We drank your health, sir&mdash;yes, I can promise you that&mdash;more than
once, too."</p>
<p>"Now listen," Charles said, tapping a cigarette and lighting it. "I have two
to three days to spare in this city and I am very anxious to discover the
whereabouts of a young lady and a man called Blute who was an agent of Mr.
Leopold Benjamin, the banker."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"That is going to be our work," Charles went on, "for every minute of the
time until I have to leave for England. I know they will be difficult to find,
because they were in a way members of Mr. Benjamin's household and that has
been broken up, but we must set our minds to it."</p>
<p>"We will find them, sir," Fritz declared confidently. "The young lady, now,"
he went on, "would she be a young lady with red hair?"</p>
<p>"Good God, how did you know that? Of course she has red hair&mdash;very
beautiful and plenty of it."</p>
<p>Fritz smiled.</p>
<p>"Rather small in figure&mdash;very pleasant voice and a real smile?"</p>
<p>"What do you know about her?" Charles demanded eagerly. "Have you seen her
lately?"</p>
<p>Fritz shook his head.</p>
<p>"Well over a year ago, sir," he admitted, "and it's a queer thing how I come
to remember it, except that she was almost the first fare I had. The young lady
you are looking for, she came out of the porter's lodge of the Palais Franz
Josef where she had been talking to the woman there. Why, it could not have
been more than a day or a couple of days after you left. I was to drive her to
the Benjamin Bank, but when we got within a street of it she stopped me. We
could see that there were soldiers guarding the place. She jumped out, paid me
and slipped away."</p>
<p>"Patricia Grey her name was."</p>
<p>"I never heard any name," Fritz admitted, "but that young lady came out of
the lodge and I drove her to Benjamin's Bank or should have done, if the
soldiers had not been there&mdash;and she had marvellous red hair. It's an easy
guess, sir, that she was the young lady you are looking for."</p>
<p>"The man's name was Marius Blute."</p>
<p>"Never heard of him, sir. But the young lady, I should know her again if I
ever saw her, and don't you forget, sir, she came out of the porter's lodge at
the Benjamin palace. She would not have been there if she had not had something
to do with the place. She asked to be driven to Benjamin's Bank. That is proof
that she belonged to the staff, and there isn't another young woman in Vienna
with hair like that&mdash;a sort of golden red it is, sir. Shines
like&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That," Charles interrupted, "is the young lady I want to find."</p>
<p>"We'll do it, sir," Fritz assured his patron confidently. "Where shall we
start?"</p>
<p>"We will go to the Benjamin Hospital. We may hear something about the
whereabouts of Mr. Benjamin there and that will be a start."</p>
<p>"Very good, sir. Shall I bring the taxi round to the front?"</p>
<p>"In ten minutes."<br>
<br></p>
<p>At the <i>Krankenhaus Benjamin</i>, Charles received his first knock-down
blow. He was received by a German doctor and surrounded on all sides by Nazi
Germans. The doctor was brusque in manner and downright in speech.</p>
<p>"The Austrian, Schwarz," he announced, in reply to Charles's enquiry, "is in
prison. His wife has been banished."</p>
<p>Charles was staggered.</p>
<p>"What have they done?" he asked. "What was the charge?"</p>
<p>"They are Jews," the doctor replied, "and they dared to have a notice that
Jews and Jewesses could claim priority here for treatment."</p>
<p>"But the hospital," Charles reminded the speaker gently, "was built and
endowed by a Jew."</p>
<p>"What does that matter?" the doctor retorted.</p>
<p>"It is Nazi Germany now which owns Austria. We have control of the hospital
and we have not a Jewish patient left. That I can tell you. The beds are filled
with Germans who suffered during the fighting outside the city. What do you
want with Dr. Schwarz?"</p>
<p>"I wanted news of Mr. Leopold Benjamin, if there was any. If not, of his
secretary. There was a man, too, named Marius Blute, who managed some of his
affairs."</p>
<p>"You will get no news of any of those people here," he was told promptly.
"The man Blute has been here and was sent away again pretty quickly. He had the
impudence to ask for money. It is true this hospital is endowed with Jewish
money, but the money would have been taken away from the Jew Benjamin if the
authorities had been able to find him. This hospital and the endowment money
and everything else belongs now to the German Government."</p>
<p>"Do you think I would be allowed to see Dr. Schwarz at the prison?" Charles
asked.</p>
<p>"I should think they would be more likely to send you in to keep him
company," was the insolent reply. "Go away, please. I have no more time to
waste&mdash;especially on an Englishman."</p>
<p>Charles was thoughtful when he regained the street.</p>
<p>"Fritz," he confided, "things are looking bad here. This is no longer the
Benjamin Hospital. The two people I am anxious to find out about have been
here&mdash;at least, Blute has&mdash;and been turned away. The whole of the
funds and the endowment have been taken over by the Germans."</p>
<p>"Swine!" Fritz murmured equably.</p>
<p>"Yes, but what about it? I have only a day or two here. I want to find Miss
Grey or Blute&mdash;Miss Grey particularly&mdash;and I don't know where to
look."</p>
<p>Fritz's queer, puckered-up little face was full of concern. He looked
doubtfully at his patron.</p>
<p>"You will excuse me, sir?" he begged. "But were they living together, these
two&mdash;any relation or anything of that sort?"</p>
<p>Charles brushed the idea away without hesitation.</p>
<p>"That was quite impossible," he answered. "Mr. Blute has brains, of course,
and I should think he's a very decent fellow, but I am sure they weren't
related and I don't think anything else would be possible. Mr. Benjamin thought
highly of Miss Grey. She came to him from the New York branch of his bank and
she soon became his personal secretary."</p>
<p>"I should suggest we drive up to the old porter's lodge, sir, and make
enquiry there. We might even get into what remains of the house. If we can find
out nothing there we shall have to try the restaurants. Everyone's obliged to
eat, anyway, and there are more than ever that are doing it in
restaurants."</p>
<p>"As you say, Fritz," Charles assented.</p>
<p>They drove immediately to the fine porter's lodge which guarded the approach
to the Benjamin mansion. The entrance gates they found were locked. Fritz
descended and rang the bell. The door of the lodge was opened in due course by
a weary-faced woman. Fritz talked to her for a few moments, after which he
returned to his employer.</p>
<p>"Nothing to be learned, sir," he reported. "This woman is the widow of the
old doorkeeper. He was killed in the fighting when the Nazis first marched in.
She says the place was overrun afterwards for weeks, first by disciplined
soldiers and searchers, and then by a rabble. No one can get into the house
now. The doors are locked and the windows barred. Forty vanloads of furniture
have been taken away."</p>
<p>"Did you ask her what was in the vans?" Charles asked.</p>
<p>"No, but I will."</p>
<p>Fritz called back the woman and Charles descended from the taxi. She
answered his questions through the railings.</p>
<p>"The vans were mostly locked up, sir," she told him, "but one thing is very
certain. The first Germans who came were very disappointed. There were many
officers amongst them and one or two civilians. They walked up and down the
quadrangle and argued. Sometimes they went back into the house as though for
another search. Then a fresh lot came. It was always the same&mdash;they went
away angry."</p>
<p>Charles searched his pocket and dropped a few reichsmarks into the woman's
eagerly outstretched hand.</p>
<p>"I want you to try and remember something for me."</p>
<p>There were tears in her eyes. Her clenched fingers were gripping the silver
coins. She was shaking from head to foot.</p>
<p>"Tell me what it is, <i>mein gn&auml;diger Herr</i>," she half sobbed.</p>
<p>"There is one person whom you must remember coming here often&mdash;Miss
Patricia Grey, Mr. Benjamin's secretary."</p>
<p>"The little one?" she asked. "Always with a smile&mdash;with the
hair&mdash;<i>ach</i>, so lovely?"</p>
<p>"That is she," Charles acknowledged. "Tell me, have you seen anything of her
lately? Can you tell me where to find her?"</p>
<p>The woman's face fell. She shook her head drearily.</p>
<p>"The last time I saw her, <i>mein Herr</i>," she confided, "she was between
two great Nazi soldiers or policemen&mdash;I do not know which&mdash;who were
bringing her away from the house. She had passed through the gates only an hour
before, waved her hand and thrown me a kiss. She was always so gay. When she
went out her face was white and set, her hair was disarranged, it looked as
though she had been struggling."</p>
<p>"What do you suppose they were doing with her?"</p>
<p>"They were taking her to prison, <i>mein Herr</i>. That I know."</p>
<p>"And you have never seen or heard of her since?"</p>
<p>"Not once."</p>
<p>"She was a very important person in the household," he persisted. "You have
not heard anything from the other servants or seen anything in the papers about
her?"</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>"<i>Mein Herr</i> will understand," she recounted sorrowfully, "that I have
lost my husband and two sons. My daughter has disappeared. There is no one
left. The young lady, she passed out of my mind."</p>
<p>"I am afraid that is quite natural," he murmured sympathetically. "Well, the
other person was a man&mdash;a rather thickset, short man. His name was Blute.
He talked a great deal. He was very clever and he worked for Mr. Benjamin."</p>
<p>"<i>Mein Herr</i>, you have not the chance this morning," she said. "Two
days after the Nazis' first visit here he was carried out on a stretcher. He
had been in the house working in the library. The soldiers had been asking him
many questions. There was a quarrel and a fight. They said that he was keeping
something back and they took him away to be examined in the prison. Never once
has he been back, neither have I heard of him. There were others who were
servants of Mr. Benjamin and Dr. Schwarz, the President of his hospital. They
have all disappeared."</p>
<p>Charles wrote down his name and his address at the hotel.</p>
<p>"If you hear anything," he begged, "will you let me know&mdash;especially
about the <i>Fr&auml;ulein</i>."</p>
<p>The woman nodded.</p>
<p>"I will let you know," she promised, "but all the people of that world have
gone&mdash;gone&mdash;gone."</p>
<p>She waved her hands downwards in despair. Charles stepped back into the
taxicab.</p>
<p>"Fritz," he said firmly, "I want to find that young lady."</p>
<p>"One young lady," Fritz sighed, "in all this city! It is so many months
ago&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Look here," Charles interrupted, "you are a sensible person. I shall try
the police only as a last resource because, to tell you the truth, I do not
think the police would help me. But think now&mdash;in what quarter of the city
would they seek to live when they were set free from prison, if ever they were
taken there? Remember, it must not be too far away. Herr Blute would stay in a
hotel, I should think. The girl would try to find cheap lodgings. Drive me to
the quarter where people in that condition of life would live. I will sit at
the caf&eacute;s, the cheap caf&eacute;s. We will take it by turns, Fritz. You
must eat six meals a day. We must go to all the restaurants. You must drink
beer or coffee at all the caf&eacute;s. A spirit of restlessness must drive you
from place to place. We must find them, Fritz. Succeed, and I will take you to
England into my own household, or, if you prefer it, I will establish you
here."</p>
<p>Life flowed back into the man's veins. He had dined enormously the night
before, he had drunk many beers, he had found a great patron. He was Viennese
to the backbone. Joy took the place of sorrow. He threw his cap into the air
and caught it.</p>
<p>"All day and all night I shall search!" he exclaimed. "They cannot escape
me, those two!"</p>
<p>"Stop a moment," Charles said. "There must be some method about our search.
I am going to take it for granted that they will follow the example of nearly
everyone in a city. They will sleep in their lodging, wherever it may be, and
eat at a restaurant. Very well. Put me down far away from the fashionable
places, in the district where clerks and middle-class people might go for their
<i>mittagessen</i>. I will have an <i>ap&eacute;ritif</i> at one place, I will
eat at another, I will drink coffee at another. You must commence with the
places for the poorer people. You must do the same thing. Every three hours you
must report to me&mdash;that is to say, we meet at Sachet's Hotel at three
o'clock, at six o'clock, at nine o'clock and at twelve. Is that
understood?"</p>
<p>"Alas, <i>mein Herr</i>, it is by now midday," Fritz declared, pointing to a
church clock.</p>
<p>"Drive me then," Charles ordered, "to the neighbourhood I spoke of and leave
me. I will be back at Sacher's Hotel at three o'clock. It may be that I shall
give myself a rest then from this seeming to eat and drink continually. I shall
leave you to carry on until six. Afterwards we will comb the city. That is
understood?"</p>
<p>"It is understood, <i>mein Herr</i>," Fritz agreed enthusiastically.</p>
<p>He mounted to the driver's seat.</p>
<p>"In a quarter-of-an-hour, <i>mein Herr</i>, you will have commenced your
part of the search."<br>
<br></p>
<p>At ten minutes to nine that evening Charles, with a crick in his neck, the
sense of a new sort of fatigue in his eyes, limped into the American Bar at
Sacher's. A familiar figure was there talking eagerly to the barman. It was
Fritz in his brand new suit and holding his chauffeur's cap in his hand.
Charles strode up to him.</p>
<p>"Well, Fritz?"</p>
<p>There was the light of triumph in Fritz's bright eyes as he turned
round.</p>
<p>"<i>Mein Herr</i>" he confided proudly, "the search is over. I triumph! It
is an affair of ten minutes before I bring you to them."</p>
<p>Charles swallowed a cocktail at a gulp. He had learnt during the afternoon
and early evening every subterfuge possible of make-believe for getting rid of
unwanted beverages. The cocktail tasted like nectar. He followed Fritz out of
the place.</p>
<p>"Which of them is it?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Both," Fritz replied. "Without a doubt, I should say both. The young lady I
could swear to. The man&mdash;he was as you described him. Listen, <i>mein
Herr</i>. I did not know," he went on, tapping his forehead, "what was to be
the end of this enterprise. I decided that I must have caution. I found, but I
did not address them. I saw them take their places in an eating house. Oh,
<i>mein Herr</i>, it is a poor place! I did not permit myself to be seen."</p>
<p>Charles frowned.</p>
<p>"They may escape."</p>
<p>"I have provided against that. There is a man at the door giving away copies
of the menu. It is a very ordinary place, <i>mein Herr</i>. I pointed them out
to him. I gave him a florin. He will give away no more menus. His eyes are
fixed upon them. They will not leave the place."</p>
<p>Charles took his seat in the taxi. It was a time when speed counted for
nothing. In six or seven minutes they had passed into the outlying regions of
the city. They pulled up with a jerk in front of a restaurant whose good days,
if it had ever had any, had long since passed. There were two plate-glass
windows, of which one was cracked and the other contained the remains of
letters advertising a certain brand of beer. Inside there was an incredibly
large number of marble-topped tables crowded with men and women mostly of the
working-class type. The upper end of the establishment, obscured by a cloud of
cigar smoke, was occupied by larger tables covered with soiled, coloured
tablecloths. These were set against a semi-circle of divan seats with one or
two cane-backed chairs, mostly in need of repair, facing them. There was half
worn out cocoanut matting on the floor and a number of spittoons. The waiters,
for the most part, wore a mixed garb consisting chiefly of black jerseys and
dark-coloured trousers and aprons. Halfway up, the room branched to the right,
and from the unseen portion came the strains of a violin. It was here that
Charles came to a sudden standstill. Walking slowly down the passageway between
the tables came a man with his eyes partially closed, playing, not altogether
without skill, upon a wretched instrument, a version of the old Viennese waltz.
He was a man of slightly below middle height who looked as though he had once
been corpulent but had shrunken away through illness or starvation. He was
dressed in a very shabby blue suit and there were deep lines in his face. It
was only when he paused in front of a table, at which a girl was sitting alone
clutching a saucer in her hand on which were a few copper coins, that Charles
realized this was the end of his search. There was something unfamiliar in his
throat. He was afraid to go on. A curious sense of shame almost kept him
speechless. Then the music came to an end in the middle of a bar. Very slowly
the musician's arms descended until they hung straight down, the instrument in
one hand, the bow in the other. He stared at Charles&mdash;quite speechless.
The girl looked up. Charles had a horrible feeling that she was shaking the
saucer at him. Then their eyes met and she gave a little cry. Every time he
thought of that awful moment later in life he was thankful that her first
expression was one of wonderful joy and it was only afterwards that the
realization of their plight swept over her. It was Charles himself who made a
gallant effort. He choked back down his throat that passionate outburst of
dismayed sympathy. He even kept it from his tone. It was a heaven-directed
impulse.</p>
<p>"Well, all I can say is," he declared, taking both the girl's hands in his,
"thank God I have found you! Put that damn' thing down and come and sit down
here, Blute. Miss Grey&mdash;Patricia!"</p>
<p>She was sobbing quietly into her handkerchief. No one took any notice. They
were accustomed to tears nowadays. Blute stumbled over the broken cane chair on
the outside and sank on to the divan. Charles took them both by the arm and
some kindly fate seemed to have sent a waiter within calling distance.</p>
<p>"Waiter," Charles ordered. "Listen! I shall give you for your
service&mdash;listen!&mdash;the biggest <i>trinkgeld</i> you ever had in your
life. I have money&mdash;see," he added, thrusting his hand into his pocket and
bringing it out. "I want two bottles of the best wine you have in the
place&mdash;Hungarian Carlowitz, if you have it. Something good, mind. Bring
brandy, too&mdash;a bottle of brandy. Rolls and butter...Something to get us
out of this place," he explained to the other two in English, "until I can take
you somewhere where we can eat."</p>
<p>The waiter set down a tray he had been carrying and departed at a gentle
run, pushing his way wherever he met with an obstacle, his senses dazed by the
memory of that handful of money. Charles drew his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i>
closer to him. Patricia had tried twice to speak but found it impossible.</p>
<p>"I know all about it without a word," Charles said firmly. "There are
hundreds just in the same plight&mdash;can't get a <i>schilling</i> of cash in
this damned country. I was very nearly in the same box myself. Luckily I have
friends always in the hotels. I left some money with Herodin when I was here
last and as I heard someone say the other day," he went on, dropping his voice
although indeed there was no one within hearing, "the Germans would elbow a
Bishop on one side, but a famous hotel proprietor was always sacred."</p>
<p>"It's Mr. Charles!" Patricia gasped. "It's Charles Mildenhall!"</p>
<p>"I know," Blute said feebly. "I recognized him but I couldn't speak. Day by
day for months I have walked these streets looking for a friendly face and been
scowled at by strangers. I've hung about the banks, I've argued at the tourist
places. Charles Mildenhall, are you not afraid we shall murder you where you
sit for that pocketful of money?"</p>
<p>"Write me your I.O.U.'s, if you like," Charles invited, drawing out notes
from his pocket. "Oh, we can do all that later on. Here's the wine. My God,
that fellow's a hustler! Thank heaven this is Vienna and not an English city.
It's good wine."</p>
<p>The waiter's hand was shaking so that he could scarcely draw the cork.
Charles leaned over and took the bottle from him, reached to another table for
a third glass and poured out three brimming tumblersful.</p>
<p>"The rolls," he said. "You're a bright fellow, I can see," he went on, as
the man began to beam upon them. "Never mind about the butter. Rolls."</p>
<p>They came. Cheese came. Delicatessen followed. Butter that was eatable made
its appearance. Neither of the two made the slightest hesitation about proving
to their host the horrible truth&mdash;they were starving. He ate bread
himself&mdash;coarse bread&mdash;and found it delicious. He had no need to be
polite about the wine. It was good. Patricia set down her tumbler half empty.
Already a little colour was flushing her cheeks.</p>
<p>"Go steady with the rolls," Charles advised them both. "I shall carry you
away from this place for dinner."</p>
<p>"Dinner," the girl faltered. "Just say that over again, Mr. Mildenhall.
Dinner&mdash;something that smells good, perhaps!"</p>
<p>"<i>Schnitzel &agrave; la Viennoise</i>" he said light-heartedly, "in my
private sitting-room at Sacher's. How will that go with you, Blute?"</p>
<p>Blute had a roll in either hand. He put one down and took a long draught of
wine. For the first time he spoke coherently. He jerked out the words. They
spelled their own tragedy.</p>
<p>"I have been in prison for six months," he groaned. "Towards the end of it
we ate the filth the warders refused."</p>
<p>Charles would have nothing to do with sympathy. He nodded as though Blute's
was quite an ordinary confidence.</p>
<p>"Hard luck! I just escaped prison myself this time. The world's gone mad,"
he added, patting Blute's back and taking a fervent grip of Patricia's hand.
"Never mind. Thank heaven Fritz and I found the right place!"</p>
<p>"You were looking for us?" she asked eagerly.</p>
<p>"I should jolly well think I was," he answered. "You don't suppose I dropped
in here to have a light meal, I hope? I knew things must have gone terribly for
you when I discovered all about the currency restrictions, that Mr. Benjamin
had completely disappeared and Dr. Schwarz was in prison. You see, I did my
best to trace you. Don't bother to tell me all about it yet. We must start
another chapter of living again. Just get the ugly things out of your minds. A
cigarette each? There we are! Now I'm the only conversationalist. I'm running
this show. I've a taxi-cab outside. I take you under my charge. I'm taking you
to the back entrance of my hotel&mdash;the manager loves me so much that he
would give it to me if I asked him! By a route which I know quite well you will
come with me to my sitting-room. I guarantee that within a few minutes of
arriving there we shall be safely enclosed from any intruder."</p>
<p>"There will be police&mdash;and soldiers&mdash;" Patricia faltered.</p>
<p>"Not within my four walls," he declared, and his voice was full of
confidence. "Now then, waiter&mdash;supposing I settle with you. How much for
the wine and rolls and all the rest of it?"</p>
<p>The man handed him a strip of paper. Charles put down the amount.</p>
<p>"And now tell me," he went on. "What is the largest tip you have ever
received?"</p>
<p>"A piece of gold," the man faltered in a voice that was scarcely audible.
"The patron who gave it to me was drunk."</p>
<p>"Well, I am sober," Charles told him, "and I am very happy. There is the
equivalent of five pieces of gold. Keep some for your wife and children."</p>
<p>They left the man supporting himself against the marble-topped table and
stammering out his thanks. Charles held Patricia and Blute firmly by the arm,
led them out into the street and tucked them into the taxi. He gave Fritz his
orders and in seven minutes they were in the back regions of the hotel. They
entered by the staff door and mounted quickly to the first floor. One turn to
the left along the corridor and they were in Suite Seventeen. Charles threw his
hat into the air.</p>
<p>"Arrived!" he cried. "Joyfully and safely! Sit down. Wait for my orders. I
am in command of this expedition."</p>
<p>His <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i> were utterly numb. Speech would have meant
a breakdown. Charles stood pressing the bell and beaming upon them. Servants
came hurrying in. There was a valet, a waiter and a chambermaid. Never did
Charles feel more thankful for his glib use of the Viennese <i>patois</i>.</p>
<p>"Greta," he directed, pointing to a door, "that is my bathroom. Take this
young lady in there. My friends have been in distress like many others in this
city. They have lost their baggage&mdash;everything. Prepare a bath for
<i>Fr&auml;ulein</i>, fetch anything she asks for and wrap her in a
dressing-gown. Do not leave the suite until after you have seen her into her
bath and then come to me for orders. Come here, Franz," he went on, turning to
the valet. "Take this gentleman into my bedroom and turn on a bath for him.
Take linen, underclothes and socks from my suitcase and put them out for him.
See that he has everything he needs&mdash;you understand?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly," the valet replied. "If the gentleman will come this way."</p>
<p>Blute followed the man out with shaking footsteps. Charles drew a long
breath and lit a cigarette.</p>
<p>"<i>Kellner,</i>" he asked, turning to the waiter, "what is best for us to
eat? My friends, you understand, have been starving."</p>
<p>The waiter smiled sympathetically. He had seen others on the verge of
starvation during the last few months.</p>
<p>"Plain dishes, <i>gn&auml;diger Herr</i>," he advised.</p>
<p>"Good," Charles agreed. "Bring them some hot consomme, perfectly plain
grilled cutlets of lamb or veal&mdash;heaps of them&mdash;figure to yourself
that there are six or twelve of us!&mdash;and serve plenty of vegetables.
Afterwards fruit. Now for wine. There we must be careful. We have
drunk&mdash;not much but a little&mdash;heavy red wine. There is no German red
wine like Carlowitz but my friends have now revived a little. We will give them
a good Moselle, a Piesporter or a Braunberger, and I think with the help of
their baths and getting accustomed to their new surroundings we could venture
on a cocktail each. Let this all be ready in half-an-hour."</p>
<p>"It shall be done, <i>mein Herr</i>."</p>
<p>"No one but Fritz, my chauffeur, is to come near this room except by my
orders. Now please send me the housekeeper."</p>
<p>The man hurried off. Charles threw open a window and looked out upon the
well-lit but still somewhat turbulent city. He drew a long breath. He was
alone. He was free to relax. His heart was beating like a boy's. There were
tears in his eyes which he forced back with difficulty. Two starved human
beings! What was there about that suddenly to change the world around him, to
excite him more than any success he had ever had? He sat down. He was growing
calmer every moment. He lit a cigarette. His brain was functioning now more
normally. He knew what had happened to him. He saw her first startled look, he
watched the joy which transformed her pinched, weary expression. He remembered
her slow coming to life, the light that flowed from her eyes as she had turned
round from the bathroom door before disappearing, the faint little wave of her
thin fingers. He knew quite well what had happened. He crossed the room and
rang the bell. He returned to the window. Every second the thing was becoming
clearer. He remembered how often she had occupied his thoughts. This wave of
tenderness was amazing. All the same, he knew that never again in his lifetime
would he feel the same thrill of exquisite joy which had come to him when he
had turned the corner of that shabby restaurant, recognized Blute, seen
Patricia lift her head, watched that dazed look in her hollow eyes suddenly
disappear, watched the transformation which that flood of light brought into
them...</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door. A stately, elderly woman dressed in black
silk was ushered in by the waiter.</p>
<p>"I was told, sir, that you wished to speak to the housekeeper," she
announced.</p>
<p>Charles was himself again. He motioned the lady to a chair.</p>
<p>"Waiter," he said, "I will have my cocktail at once. Let it be one of
Frederick's special White Ladies."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>The dinner commenced almost normally except for the slight <i>badinage</i>
occasioned by Blute's appearance in trousers turned up four times.</p>
<p>"I had no idea that I was such a fine fellow," Charles remarked as he took
his place.</p>
<p>"I remember thinking the first time we met," Patricia confessed demurely,
"that you had rather nice legs."</p>
<p>Charles looked at her with a smile. Already the joys of anticipation were
making a lover of him. The deathly pallor had gone from her face, although her
eyes were still sunken. She had entered from the bathroom with a faint glow
upon her cheeks and a silk dressing-gown of Charles's effectively shortened
with the aid of safety pins, displaying something of her beautifully
silk-stockinged legs. She glanced at her host a little suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Do you travel round the world," she asked, "with a choice selection of
lady's underwear of all sizes as part of your wardrobe, and do you really use
for yourself all those powders and delicate perfumes the maid was trying to
press upon me?"</p>
<p>"Not guilty," he assured her. "I travel always alone, as my own servant
would tell you if he were here. Fortunately, though, I choose the right hotel.
All these lighter feminine belongings came from the ladies' hairdressing
department, which that delightful old housekeeper opened up for the
occasion."</p>
<p>"And the&mdash;other things I am wearing?" she asked with a touch of her old
self in her mischievous glance.</p>
<p>"If you came here in the daytime," he pointed out, "you would notice that
there are several establishments from Paris and two from Vienna itself which
have showcases in the hall. The housekeeper procured the keys. We looted
them."</p>
<p>"You have very good taste," she told him.</p>
<p>"I am glad they please you," he answered. "I am afraid I can't claim all the
credit. There were two showcases&mdash;I took one and the housekeeper the
other. I simply helped myself to an armful&mdash;everything that was displayed.
The housekeeper was more selective. She explained that everything was likely to
fit you because in showcases they always display the articles of women's attire
in the smaller sizes because they look more attractive."</p>
<p>"You pick up things very quickly," she smiled, taking a long delicious sip
of her cocktail. "Oh, what happiness!" she went on, with her eyes still half
closed. "The feeling, the caress of this silk, the perfume of violets, the
taste of a real cocktail, the smell of these cutlets! Mr. Mildenhall, you are a
god and this is a personally conducted tour into Paradise!"</p>
<p>"Entirely my sentiments," Blute murmured, gripping at his trousers.</p>
<p>"To be light-hearted again even for a moment&mdash;it is wonderful!"
Patricia declared, patting her host's hand.</p>
<p>"Another part of my anatomy is aiming at other things," Blute grunted. "I
used to think I would be a happy man to lose four inches around the waist. They
have gone, but the road to happiness&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Not a word!" Patricia insisted. "Until dinner is over the past is dead. I
am in Paradise and my guide is serving my food."</p>
<p>"Lamb cutlets with <i>Sauce B&eacute;arnaise</i>," Blute murmured. "What a
novelty but what a heavenly sauce!"</p>
<p>The soft delicate wines were drunk almost with reverence. The cutlets
disappeared in almost miraculous fashion. Patricia looked up guiltily as she
finished her second and found the waiter by her side. He had entered into the
spirit of the feast, however, and he gave her no time to hesitate. He served
her and passed on.</p>
<p>"It is my third cutlet," she confessed. "They are so large, too, but oh, how
delicious!"</p>
<p>"The Viennese is the only school of cookery," Charles pronounced, "which
condescends to acknowledge the grill. The French will have none of it."</p>
<p>"As a hungry&mdash;let me throw away affectation and say a starving girl,"
Patricia declared, "I am glad that we are in Vienna."</p>
<p>Not a single serious word was spoken during that meal from beginning to end.
Towards its conclusion there was a knock at the door and the housekeeper
reappeared. She was followed by two girls carrying frocks and coats upon each
arm. She smiled graciously upon the diners.</p>
<p>"I am too soon, I know," she said. "I shall take my young ladies into the
bedroom and await your convenience. I was fortunate enough to find my sister
and my two nieces in our establishment. They were only too anxious to
help."</p>
<p>Charles rose to his feet and directed them to his bedroom.</p>
<p>"We will send you the young lady in a quarter-of-an-hour, Madame," he
promised. "Will you take your assistants in there and ring for the chambermaid
if there is anything you want?"</p>
<p>"Of course, this is a dream!" Patricia laughed a little jerkily. "Please,
Mr. Mildenhall&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Charles," he interrupted.</p>
<p>"Charles, then," she went on. "This really isn't necessary. We can telephone
to one of the big establishments for a gown and a hat and I can buy anything
else I want to-morrow if you let me have a little money."</p>
<p>"Can't disappoint the dear old lady," he said. "She's knocked them all up
and they're quite excited about it. Don't think those are all useless evening
frocks. I particularly said a travelling gown, some tweeds and simple
hats."</p>
<p>"You are an angel!" she told him. "All the same&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"I am not going to say anything more. I am too happy to protest. I will talk
reasonably about the clothes and everything soon&mdash;not now."</p>
<p>"I can quite see," he said, "why Mr. Leopold Benjamin chose you for his
perfect secretary. You have the practical mind."</p>
<p>"Wait till I get it working," she warned him. "You must remember that even
Mr. Benjamin's chosen secretary, in hell one moment and in heaven the next, is
finding it a little difficult to keep her feet upon the ground. But please let
me warn you of this. You may be King Cophetua himself, but I am only going to
have from that woman one travelling gown and perhaps one other, two hats, and
someone will have to get me a pair of shoes. I have crossed the Atlantic with
less than that. The oddments&mdash;if you are going to let me have a little
money&mdash;I know where to get myself."</p>
<p>"We'll deal with this <i>souffl&eacute;</i>," he suggested, "and come to
terms later on and then I'll show you whether I can be practical, too."</p>
<p>He crossed the room and lifted the telephone receiver.</p>
<p>"Is Mr. Herodin in his room?" he asked.</p>
<p>"And speaking."</p>
<p>"I need your help, Herodin," Charles said. "Mildenhall speaking."</p>
<p>"I will step up to your room at once, sir."</p>
<p>"Even when we have finished dinner," Charles remarked as he resumed his
seat, "you two will be too exhausted to discuss plans seriously. I must tell
you, however, that there is a serious situation to be faced. The news to-day
seems to be better but I'm afraid it's rather a mistake to build upon it. The
Germans here all think that because the F&uuml;hrer has consented to receive a
Polish envoy there will be no war. I think the people are wrong. That is all I
want to say for the moment, but we have to bear it in mind. It may alter our
plans."</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door and Mr. Herodin entered.</p>
<p>"Herodin," Charles said, "I will not introduce you to my two guests. It will
leave you freer to answer any questions you may be asked. I want you to
arrange, however, rooms in a strictly private part of your hotel for the young
lady and a room also for the gentleman."</p>
<p>Blute held up his hand.</p>
<p>"Forgive me, Mr. Mildenhall," he begged. "Through all my misadventures,
except for the time I was temporarily cut off from the world, otherwise in
prison, I have spent my nights always in one place. I cannot break that rule. I
have a very grave responsibility upon my shoulders. Your offer is one of
kindness and I will admit that I am not fit to be seen upon the streets, but I
am going to make a few little changes in my attire and I can easily reach the
place where it is my duty to sleep."</p>
<p>"That's quite all right," Charles agreed. "We'll fix you up in the style of
the perfect Viennese dandy to-morrow morning."</p>
<p>"You are very kind," Blute acknowledged, "but I still must leave and enter
by the back door."</p>
<p>"That," Mr. Herodin observed with a smile, "can be arranged."</p>
<p>"The young lady," Charles said, "will be ready for her room in an hour's
time. Will you kindly arrange to have a maid here then to show her where it is
and look after her?"</p>
<p>The <i>h&ocirc;telier</i> bowed.</p>
<p>"I quite understand, Mr. Mildenhall. I will send a trusted chambermaid here
at the time you say and I will have a room in the quietest part of the hotel
prepared. I shall be honoured to do anything I can for your guests."</p>
<p>Charles nodded his acknowledgements. The manager bowed once more and left
them.</p>
<p>"Of course, I hope you don't think I am butting in too much," Charles
observed. "I cannot help treating you two like Babes in the Wood to-night! We
will all be more normal to-morrow morning, perhaps."</p>
<p>"You are being kindness itself," Patricia declared. "Dear host," she went
on, taking his hand and holding it tightly, "if there is one thing that
sometimes makes me shiver with joy, it is the continual reflection that I have
not to return to the lodging house where I have spent the last two months. It
costs&mdash;very little&mdash;but it is horrible. I am not used to fear, but I
was afraid there."</p>
<p>"Thank God you'll never see the beastly place again, then!" Charles
exclaimed.<br>
<br></p>
<p>In due course Charles escorted Patricia to the room where the housekeeper
and her nieces were waiting. He returned to find Blute with a blissful
expression on his face smoking a large cigar.</p>
<p>"The waiter insisted," he apologized. "This is the first time I have smoked
a cigar for five months. I cannot tell you the happiness."</p>
<p>"Capital! How are you feeling now, Mr. Blute?"</p>
<p>"I am a man again," the other declared. "What I ache for still is one thing
and one thing only&mdash;a few serious words with you."</p>
<p>"I was hoping you might," was the quiet reply. "I will tell you why, or
rather you have it in what I told you a few minutes ago. This country is on the
threshold of war. I can tell you pretty well to an hour when that will
come."</p>
<p>"I feared it," Blute said gloomily. "Here the people are taking it lightly.
They are too obsessed all over Austria with this stupefying chaos of German
propaganda. They believe that England will threaten and barter and argue, but
they do not believe that she will fight."</p>
<p>"They are wrong. In this room I can talk to you in a way I should not have
ventured to a week ago. I have been on a special mission to Poland. On the one
hand I have had to convince their leaders of a fact which they were only too
ready to accept&mdash;that England would keep strictly to her obligations, that
France would do the same and that the day Poland was invaded both countries
would declare war against Germany. Well, as I said, they were only too eager to
believe that. On the other hand, it was my duty to point out to them that no
practical aid could be looked for from England or even from France for many
months&mdash;neither by air, nor by land, nor by sea could we reach her with
any fighting forces. She must bear that in mind every time she remembered the
pact. Our help would come, our word would be kept but if she went to war at the
present moment she must make up her mind that she would have to look after
herself for at least six months."</p>
<p>"What was the reply to that?" Blute asked.</p>
<p>"Well, they listened to me but all the time they shrugged their shoulders,
they babbled about the British Fleet, the French Army, our united air strength.
The practical side of the matter is that I have been over to drill into them
hard facts which they seem determined to ignore. I left them with the plainest
statement of the situation, exactly as it exists; and I insisted upon it that
not only the politicians but also the Air Field-Marshal, the Commander-in-Chief
of the Army and the man who is responsible for their Navy be given the
opportunity of listening to me. I battered it into their understandings that
they would probably have five to six months' fighting without a soul to help
them except by indirect pressure. It made no difference, I fear. I know for a
fact that the plenipotentiary Hitler insists upon having will not be sent; I
also know that if he does not arrive Hitler will move across the frontier
immediately, and England and France will be at war with Germany twenty-four
hours later."</p>
<p>"It is bad news. It affects, of course, what I have to say to you. It
affects the position in which Miss Grey is placed. It affects my position...I
fancy I hear her returning."</p>
<p>"I shall ring, then, for the coffee," Charles announced, rising to his feet.
"As soon as Miss Grey comes I can hear your story and we will consider what
help I can give you."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-12" id="ch-12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p>Patricia came quietly back, helped herself to coffee, lit a cigarette and
slipped into a corner of the couch. The housekeeper explained the situation to
Charles, who went in search of her.</p>
<p>"The very gracious young lady," she said, "has made our task a pleasant one.
She has moved us to admiration, but she is very firm. She has chosen two frocks
of the least expensive stock, a travelling coat and two simple hats. She would
look at nothing else. She has asked us to procure a pair of shoes and a pair of
slippers, for which we have taken her measurements, and&mdash;the
<i>gn&auml;diger Herr</i> will pardon me&mdash;of the underclothes she has
asked for two more sets to be supplied to-morrow morning with the other things.
I have calculated out the amounts. I do not think that Herr Mildenhall will
find the cost excessive. The <i>Fr&auml;ulein</i> was very obstinate. The total
amount of the indebtedness I have reckoned out at the figure shown here. The
<i>gn&atilde;diger Herr</i> may be grateful from his point of view that
<i>Fr&auml;ulein</i> is not like most of the young ladies we have to deal
with."</p>
<p>Charles glanced at the bill.</p>
<p>"But it is ridiculous!" he exclaimed.</p>
<p>The housekeeper shook her head sadly.</p>
<p>"Perhaps," she remarked, smiling as the idea occurred to her, "Herr
Mildenhall and the young lady will be in Vienna later on. They will bear in
mind the fact that it is my sister who has been of assistance."</p>
<p>"That is indeed exceedingly likely," Charles agreed, "and with your
permission I shall add this note for distribution between yourself and the
young ladies, to compensate you for your&mdash;er&mdash;unusual services."</p>
<p>The housekeeper dropped one of the curtsies of her youth.</p>
<p>"The gift of <i>mein Herr</i> is joyously accepted," she said. "The two
young ladies will join me in my thanks."</p>
<p>Charles hurried back into the salon. He took a place by Patricia's side upon
the divan. Marius Blute disposed of himself in an easy chair opposite. Charles
held up his hand.</p>
<p>"One moment," he begged.</p>
<p>He pressed the bell for the waiter.</p>
<p>"There are omissions here," he said, pointing to the table. "We must rectify
them."</p>
<p>From the waiter he ordered French brandy, an orange and lemon squash for
Patricia, with a small Grand Marnier to drink with her coffee. The cigars were
brought back again. The conversation began.</p>
<p>"My one object," Blute said, lighting a fresh cigar, "is to save words. I
want to put my situation and the situation of Miss Grey before you, sir, in as
short a time as possible."</p>
<p>"Excellent," Charles murmured.</p>
<p>"For ten years," Blute continued, "I have been a sort of private
confidential agent to Mr. Leopold Benjamin. His need of me was based upon this
idea. He was the most far-seeing man I have ever come across. He foresaw twelve
years ago a state of affairs very like the present one. He employed me for one
purpose and one purpose only. It was my business to travel to the cities of
Europe which contained sound banking institutions, to open up a correspondence
with them on his behalf so that he could deposit money there at a reasonable
rate of interest and assume possession of it when the necessity arrived. I
shall speak only in sterling so that you, Mr. Mildenhall, who are perhaps not a
great financier, will understand in a moment. I have invested nine millions
sterling for Mr. Benjamin in this fashion. It has increased in value so that it
is now ten millions. Besides this he had about three millions in Vienna. Two
million the Nazis stripped him of the day they sacked his bank; one million he
took away with him in cash and short-dated bills. Twenty thousand pounds are
somewhere waiting for Miss Grey and fifty thousand for me&mdash;but we have not
the faintest idea where."</p>
<p>"Let me get my breath," Charles begged. "Did you draw no salary, Blute?"</p>
<p>"A splendid one," the latter acknowledged. "I spent more than half of it in
expenses, the rest I left in Benjamin's Bank. It was taken over by the
government."</p>
<p>"That explains your situation," Charles admitted. "Now, what about Miss
Grey?"</p>
<p>"My salary," she confided, "was six hundred pounds a year. It was lodged to
an account in my name. I drew the money exactly as I required it. Two years ago
I thought I should like a small car. I bought it with Mr. Benjamin's approval.
He paid for my lessons in driving and that Christmas Mrs. Benjamin gave me a
brooch which must have been worth two or three hundred pounds. When the assets
of the bank were devoured by the raids following the <i>Anschluss</i>, they
helped themselves to the deposits and mine went with the rest."</p>
<p>"This is all very clear," Charles said, "but what I do not understand is
this. Mr. Benjamin struck me as being a very delightful, a generous and a
sympathetic person. I cannot conceive his suddenly flying out of the country
and leaving you two&mdash;Miss Grey still in charge of his affairs and his
secretary, and you, Blute, as his agent&mdash;without any form of farewell or
without any certainty that your balances in the bank would not be touched. He
must have known that if this happened you were penniless."</p>
<p>"Understand at once," Blute begged, "that neither Miss Grey nor I have a
word of complaint against Leopold Benjamin. He would be incapable of any act of
unkindness or inhumanity. On the night he received that terrible message and
decided to leave the country he sent for us both. You will remember the
occasion, Mr. Mildenhall. You yourself were dining in the house. His aeroplane
was only a mile away. He told us his decision. We agreed that it was for the
best. He laid upon us both a special task. He knew quite well that it would
cost a great deal of money. We have both been working upon it for the last two
years. He handed over to us, before he departed, ten thousand pounds in Bank of
England notes. We were to deduct our own expenses or balances at the bank from
this and the rest was to go towards the responsibility he laid upon us. Mr.
Benjamin was princely in his departure from us as he had been through his life.
He is not to be blamed in the least for our misfortunes or that we have come
very near starvation."</p>
<p>"I'm glad to hear it," Charles declared. "I hate to be disappointed in
people. I believed in Mr. Benjamin. Now then, we come to the pith of the story.
What happened to all the money?"</p>
<p>"The simplest, most foolish thing that could possibly happen," Blute
groaned. "To carry an amount like that about with me was an utter
impossibility. Miss Grey felt just the same about it. What we had to do for Mr.
Benjamin was a costly affair. I spent a thousand pounds of it the first day, a
second thousand the next day. By that time the trouble was getting worse here.
Miss Grey, at my suggestion, decided to send a thousand pounds back to America.
We arranged that. I sent my wife back home with another two thousand. We pooled
the rest and I let Miss Grey have such money as she wanted as occasion arose.
She was still living in the house. I was living not a quarter of a mile
away&mdash;soon I shall have occasion to tell you where. The night that the
house was raided by the Nazis all Vienna went mad. The Nazis were bitterly
disappointed. They searched every person in the house. They took Miss Grey's
money and they simply treated it as a terrific joke when she assured them that
it was part of her salary and without it she was penniless. They found me in
the library where I worked most evenings and they found also my money which I
kept in a safe behind the desk. I fought for it but I hadn't a chance. I was
carried away on a stretcher and was found by Miss Grey a week afterwards in a
hospital. Not a penny of my money was left. Miss Grey went to the bank. It was
already too late. The assets had been seized, a seal put upon the safes and not
a <i>schilling</i> was parted with to any of the depositors. She and I were
left very nearly destitute. I lodged a complaint in the Courts. I was perhaps
foolish but it seemed to me there was nothing else to be done. As a result we
were thrown into prison. When I was freed I found Miss Grey with difficulty. I
tried to get a job at a tourist agency. Meanwhile I wrote home to my wife for
money. Miss Grey wrote to America. We both of us wrote to Mr. Benjamin at every
address we could think of. No answer came to either of us from anywhere. Soon
we saw official notices in all the Austrian and German papers. What they called
'a moratorium' existed."</p>
<p>"I read of that," Charles murmured.</p>
<p>"No money from abroad could be claimed by individuals until the exchanges
had been adjusted. If money was sent it was confiscated by the State and any
letters accompanying it were destroyed by the censor. It was sheer robbery.
Meanwhile our employment came to an end. We met day by day. It was impossible
for me to leave Vienna because of the money I had already spent on Mr.
Benjamin's account. Between us we could not raise enough for Miss Grey's
passage to England, much less back to America."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you go on writing to Mr. Benjamin?" Charles asked.</p>
<p>"Because we neither of us had the slightest idea where he actually was,"
Patricia pointed out eagerly. "It was absolutely necessary, until he could
reach a place of safety, that no one should know his whereabouts. As soon as
that time arrived he promised to write to us. We have had not a line, but as
every letter that arrived here was censored, it seemed a hopeless task to get
in touch with anyone."</p>
<p>"When disaster first came," Blute went on, "we had three hopes. One was that
we should hear from Mr. Benjamin, that he would get a letter through to us
somehow or other notwithstanding the censorship; the second was that the
Benjamin Hospital, with a foundation from him which brought them in the
equivalent of a quarter of a million dollars a year, would let us have the sum
we needed to complete our obligations to Mr. Benjamin, and the third
hope&mdash;it was the slimmest of all&mdash;was that we might some day or other
come across a friend passing through Vienna."</p>
<p>"Nothing so wonderful as this, though, ever entered into our dreams,"
Patricia murmured.</p>
<p>"Well, that's a very clear explanation of everything that has happened,"
Charles pronounced. "It has been a horrible time for both of you. Now tell me
this&mdash;I have made a wild guess. Am I right? The work you undertook for
your Chief&mdash;had it anything to do with getting all his pictures and
wonderful possessions out of Vienna?"</p>
<p>They were both silent.</p>
<p>"That was just what it was," Blute said hoarsely after a moment's pause. "We
came so near success&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You didn't succeed, then?"</p>
<p>There was a long and melancholy silence. Blute was shaking his head sadly.
Patricia sat with her hands folded in front of her and it seemed to Charles
that she was going through some sort of inward struggle. When at last she spoke
it was as though the three words she uttered were tearing at her very
heartstrings.</p>
<p>"No," she confessed. "We failed."</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door of the salon. The waiter entered. He indicated
a chambermaid who was waiting outside.</p>
<p>"The young woman has come," he announced, "to fetch the <i>Fr&auml;ulein</i>
who was dining here and who has a room on the other side of the hotel. It is a
little difficult to find without help."</p>
<p>Patricia rose to her feet. She held out her hands to her host.</p>
<p>"Mr. Mildenhall," she said, "Charles, if you wish it&mdash;there are no
words I can use to thank you. I go to bed without fear, almost happy for the
first time for months. It is all your doing."</p>
<p>"'Almost' happy?" he repeated.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>"If you knew the difference between now and last night," she said smiling,
"you would not worry about the 'almost.'"</p>
<p>"When can we meet to-morrow?"</p>
<p>"I do not know," she answered thoughtfully. "I must see Mr. Blute, but I am
too weary to talk any more to-night."</p>
<p>"Come and have your coffee and rolls with me here in the morning," he
begged. "The chambermaid who looks after you will bring you along. I will be
ready at nine o'clock."</p>
<p>"You wish it?"</p>
<p>"I do seriously," he insisted.</p>
<p>He led her towards the door.</p>
<p>"I wish it," he repeated, "and I am determined also to know the meaning of
that 'almost.'"</p>
<p>The light faded from her face. She shook her head.</p>
<p>"That," she said, "I shall not tell you just yet. It is not for you to know.
Be satisfied with thinking what you have done for us, the misery from which you
have snatched poor Mr. Blute and me. Apart from all of which," she added, "I
shall tell you this&mdash;"</p>
<p>She grasped his hand tightly. Suddenly she raised his fingers to her lips
and kissed them.</p>
<p>"You are the sweetest Good Samaritan," she cried, "the most wonderful and
most tactful who ever brought a poor girl back into life!"</p>
<p>Her feet seemed to have recovered some of their old grace and lightness. She
was across the room in a moment. She waved her hand and disappeared with the
chambermaid.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p>Marius Blute had risen to his feet when Charles returned to his easy chair.
The latter waved him back again.</p>
<p>"Sit down and finish your cigar," he invited. "That is, unless you are
tired."</p>
<p>"I am no longer tired," Blute said. 'T am a strong man, really. No man could
have gone through what I went through in prison unless he had a sound
constitution. Wine and good food were what I needed. I am myself again. But I
must not keep you up."</p>
<p>"My dear fellow," Charles protested, "does anyone ever go to bed in Vienna
before midnight? If you were not here I should only go out to a caf&eacute;.
Remember, I have only heard just a sketch of your adventures."</p>
<p>"It is difficult," Blute reflected, "to explain everything."</p>
<p>"Could you tell me this?" Charles asked. "What was the meaning of that
'almost' in Miss Grey's farewell speech? She had been looking so radiantly
happy all the evening. Now just a little of the cloud seems to have come
back."</p>
<p>"If I were to tell you what I think," Blute said thoughtfully, "I believe
that she would be very angry with me."</p>
<p>"There is something that still troubles her, then?"</p>
<p>"There is something."</p>
<p>"Is there anything more I could do?" Charles asked bluntly.</p>
<p>"Nothing that I could ask you," Blute replied, "nothing that either of us
has the faintest right to ask you to do."</p>
<p>"Look here, Blute," Charles confided, "I'll let you into a secret. I am very
fond of Miss Grey."</p>
<p>"That is no secret," was the other's quiet comment.</p>
<p>"I dare say not," Charles observed smiling. "To tell you the truth," he went
on, "I really didn't know it myself. I thought Miss Grey was very charming and
all that, but it wasn't until I saw her to-night in that horrible place and saw
how ill and miserable she looked, and realized how she must have
suffered&mdash;well, it wasn't until then, anyhow, that I suddenly discovered I
was very, very fond of her. I believe that if she realized how fond, she'd have
explained that 'almost.'"</p>
<p>"I think I know what Miss Grey meant. Our re-establishment, which has come
about entirely due to your kindness, has reminded us that our task is not
complete."</p>
<p>"Well," Charles pointed out, "I am still here, still at your service. How
can I help you further?"</p>
<p>"It is not fair," Blute said, moving uneasily in his place, "to invite you
into an adventure in which you have everything to lose and nothing to gain.
More especially Miss Grey will feel this because you have just about saved our
lives in so charming a manner."</p>
<p>"Absurd!" Charles declared lightly. "All that I have done has been a
pleasure to me. Don't think that I have finished with you, my friend Blute.
There is the question of funds to settle. I can help you there&mdash;you and
Miss Grey. It is impossible for you to get at your money&mdash;I mean your own
money apart from what you have been robbed of. I can get at all I want without
difficulty. Tell me frankly, beyond getting you out of the country what do you
need money for? Is it possible that you still have a hope of saving any of Mr.
Benjamin's glorious collection?"</p>
<p>Blute was on his feet. Excitement gleamed in his eyes. He whirled his
arms.</p>
<p>"Listen, my friend!" he cried. 'It comes! I can keep silent no longer! It
will be impossible for me to keep my mouth closed. Miss Grey will be angry. It
cannot be helped. Be prepared to be astonished, my friend. Save for the last
struggle, that marvellous young woman and I have succeeded in achieving the
impossible. All those glorious paintings&mdash;the two Andrea del Sartos, the
Fra Filippo Lippis, the Murillo, the Titian, the two Spanish pictures, the
Cellini handwork&mdash;oh! the great list of immortal things, the fit
possessions of a god&mdash;we have saved them! Not yet have they been touched
by one of Hitler's emissaries, not once have the greedy eyes of his henchmen
revelled in their beauties. There were days when we worked from sunrise till
night, and if we ate it was without knowing it, and if we drank it was still
bending over our tasks. That girl, with the heart of a lioness and the frame of
a child, worked with me with the strength of a dozen men. We succeeded. The
collection is in our keeping. Never has there been so much fury spent upon any
Nazi failure as there has been spent over this one. Everyone wondered at the
final rush of that big band of the Gestapo into Vienna. It was to make sure of
their loot. It was to make sure of their millions. They came&mdash;and what did
they find? Half a mile of empty walls."</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say that you actually got the whole collection away?"
Charles demanded incredulously. 'T know that a great many of the pictures had
gone from the first gallery the night of the scare, but in less than a week the
whole house was being ransacked by the Nazis."</p>
<p>"The whole collection is still under our control," Blute declared. "We had
even reached the final steps in its disposal. Then our luck failed. Perhaps we
were a little careless one day. So many things seemed to have happened between
that we began to hope we had been forgotten. Perhaps we were wrong. At any
rate, our days of tribulation arrived. We were stripped of every <i>pfennig</i>
we possessed, we were questioned and bullied to death. For months I lay in one
prison and Patricia Grey in another. We were tortured&mdash;but never
mind&mdash;we have finished with the horrors. Just as summarily as we were
imprisoned we were thrown out onto the streets two months ago&mdash;penniless.
For a time we were followed everywhere we went, then I think they gave us up.
They saw me in the clothes of a beggar of the street, they saw me eating crusts
at the back doors of the restaurants which in the old days I had patronized.
They saw her in the same plight. Then little paragraphs began to appear in the
papers that some of the pictures had been seen in Paris and some in London.
They cooled off, they left us alone except now and then to mock at us as we
passed. There we were starving in the streets, and treasures worth millions
still safe here, still waiting only for us to take the final step. And we were
without a <i>pfennig</i> towards a meal, without the money now for a letter or
a telegram, without any means of opening up communication outside the ring of
the city. Have you ever considered, Mr. Charles Mildenhall, the psychological,
the actual mental condition of the really penniless man or woman?"</p>
<p>"No, and I don't want to just now," Charles declared. "Let's get on with
this. I gather that by some extraordinary means the pictures remain hidden,
that you still have access to them and with money you could carry out your
plans to restore them to Leopold Benjamin."</p>
<p>"With money and help&mdash;yes. But listen, Mr. Mildenhall. The last steps
will be the most dangerous. You are still a young man and you have all that you
need in life. Why should you risk everything in an enterprise of this
sort?"</p>
<p>Charles smiled deliberately. It was not a humorous effort. It just meant the
slow relaxation of his features from his strained period of listening.</p>
<p>"For the same reason, I suppose," he replied, "that half the men in the
world have, some time or another, made fools of themselves. I don't admit that
I am going to make a fool of myself, but I am going to help you and Patricia to
finish your adventure whatever we may have to go through."</p>
<p>Blute spent several moments of indecision, his eyes fixed intently upon the
speaker.</p>
<p>"If you were an ordinary young man," he began, "I should warn you once more.
As it is, I shall not do so. I believe that you have made up your mind. Very
well, I proceed&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Let me tell you this one thing about myself which may set your mind a
little more at ease," Charles insisted, finishing his brandy and lighting a
cigarette. "I started in the diplomatic world with every mortal advantage.
Things were made far too easy for me. I abandoned the straightforward course
towards the final goal of an ambassadorship solely because the preliminaries
were too circumscribed. I felt a craving for adventure. My year as military
attache did not help me in the least. I happened to be on friendly terms with
our Foreign Secretary. I have one great gift&mdash;the gift of
languages&mdash;so I put it up to him that I could be of more use to the
country as a free lance, wandering from one seat of disturbance to another,
undertaking special missions, bringing back from remote places at times very
valuable information. He agreed and off I went. I shall never earn any great
distinctions, I shall never have my chest covered with medals and orders.
People will repeat my name and wonder in years to come what I have done to be
still hanging about the Foreign Office. I don't mind. I shall have lived the
life I wanted to live."</p>
<p>Blute finished his brandy and rose to his feet. With a grin across the table
at Charles he put several of the cigars in his pocket.</p>
<p>"Put on your hat and coat," he enjoined, "and come with me."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-14" id="ch-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p>Charles piloted his companion by the intricate route leading through the
back quarters of the hotel to the lift and into the courtyard. Fritz was
sitting on the box seat of his taxicab smoking a cigarette and reading the
evening paper. Blute seized Charles's arm.</p>
<p>"This chauffeur!" he exclaimed. "Remember, the fate of our whole enterprise
will depend upon his discretion."</p>
<p>"I pledge my word upon it," was the confident reply. "I have known him for
years. He is absolutely trustworthy. He is my man body and soul. Apart from
that, he has somewhat the spirit of an adventurer and he is an out-and-out
Viennese, loathing the Germans."</p>
<p>"Satisfied," Blute said tersely. "I will direct him myself."</p>
<p>Fritz, with smiling face, held open the door. Charles entered the vehicle.
Blute remained talking with Fritz for almost five minutes. Afterwards he took
his place inside. Fritz closed the door and they drove off.</p>
<p>"I am satisfied with your chauffeur," Blute declared. "He is intelligent, he
worships you, he has quick wit, he is likely to be useful to us."</p>
<p>"Is it permitted to ask where we are going?" Charles enquired.</p>
<p>"We are going by a roundabout course," Blute confided, "to a compound
attached to the garage of Mr. Leopold Benjamin's palace. It abuts upon a lane
where there are no other buildings and it is nearly a quarter of a mile from
the house. Listen while I explain something. Do not let your spirits fall when
I speak of a secret passage because, although I know these places have no
novelty as hiding resorts and would be most unlikely to escape the notice of a
trained S.S. man, you will have to take my word for it that this is one of the
most wonderful secret passages in Europe. The palace in which Mr. Benjamin
lived was built, as you know, by the Hapsburgs, and it has always remained a
Royal Domain until it was purchased by Mr. Benjamin's grandfather from the
Archduke Ferdinand. The Archduke had a mistress to whom he was devoted, but he
had also a jealous wife and family. He discovered the existence of this passage
for himself, spent millions upon its development and built the compound as a
villa, where the lady was installed. None of this appears in any published
guide-book and most people seem to have forgotten the story. The passage is a
quarter of a mile long and it commences fifty feet from the end of the picture
gallery. It terminates in the room in which I have slept every night I have
been free, before and after I was in prison. The only person to whom Mr.
Benjamin ever revealed its intricacies was myself. I can safely say that no one
else breathing has ever passed from one end of it to the other, or been shown
the exit. No one whom I have ever come across in the city or amongst the
hundreds of guests who have visited Mr. Benjamin have ever known that there was
such a place. The police have no information concerning it, the twelve
specialists whom Mr. Benjamin brought from America to install ventilation at
various points and to connect it up electrically returned to the States when
their job was over&mdash;well paid, I can promise you, but under a covenant
never again to set foot in Europe. There are twenty-four doors between the
palace and the villa. Every one opens in a different manner, and there is a
secret connected with the key of every one of them. Patricia Grey and I have
committed the plan to memory and destroyed it. Without our aid it would be a
definite impossibility for anyone to traverse it."</p>
<p>"I'll take your word for it," Charles declared.</p>
<p>"The impossibility of trusting a single person of our acquaintance with a
secret of such vast importance," Blute went on, "made it necessary for both
Miss Grey and myself to go through an amount of physical labour which I could
not describe to you. We have removed every canvas from three hundred frames and
those we have transported into their present hiding place, which is within a
few yards of where I have slept for many months. The canvases alone represent a
value of some thirty million dollars and are the most valuable collection of
Old Masters in any private ownership in the world."</p>
<p>"Amazing!" Charles murmured. "I can't grapple with it all yet. Tell me,
though," he added, looking out of the window and conscious of a sudden
obscurity, "why has Fritz turned off his lights?"</p>
<p>"We are in what used to be a private road," Blute confided, "leading to the
compound. Now that the Benjamin house is unoccupied and partly in ruins the
compound&mdash;part of which had been used as a garage&mdash;was also naturally
left deserted. When I first started upon my scheme for concealing the pictures
I had a camp bed and a few necessaries moved into it and that has been my home.
We are fast approaching it."</p>
<p>They turned in between two pillars, gigantic obelisks they appeared in the
semi-darkness. They were in what had once been a courtyard but which was now
overgrown with weeds. Blute pointed to a distant corner.</p>
<p>"Under the wall there," he told Fritz, "with your lights turned off, you
will be completely out of sight. There is no thoroughfare here and I may tell
you that I have never known anyone to pass down this road. If by any
hundred-to-one chance anyone should ask you what you are doing there, invent
any story you like, but be sure not to say you brought a fare here."</p>
<p>"It is well understood, <i>mein Herr</i>," Fritz declared. "I shall say that
I brought my young lady, that she ran away promising to return at once and has
given me the hoop-la!"</p>
<p>"We shall make good use of that fellow, I'm sure," Blute remarked. "Follow
me very carefully, Mr. Mildenhall," he said, pointing to a high hedge of
laurels. "These bushes are a good screen but they have grown."</p>
<p>He paused at last before a long low building. He counted the bricks from a
certain spot, removed one when he had arrived at the fourteenth by simply
pressing a piece of the mortar, thrust his hand into the cavity, turned a
handle and swung open a door. He replaced the brick, stepped into a dark
apartment and beckoned to Charles to follow him.</p>
<p>"Now don't be alarmed that I use this torch," Blute warned his companion.
"The wires have been cut and we daren't show much light, anyway."</p>
<p>He flashed the torch around. It was a dreary-looking place and the walls
showed signs of damp and decay. In a distant corner was a plain iron bedstead,
a rather dejected-looking screen, two chairs, an oil stove and a cupboard.</p>
<p>"My surroundings, as you see, are not luxurious," Blute pointed out.
"Nevertheless, as I told you, the only nights I have not slept here since Mr.
Benjamin left were the nights I spent in prison."</p>
<p>"And you have never been disturbed?" Charles asked.</p>
<p>"Not only have I never been disturbed but I am convinced that no one has
ever visited this place either in the daytime or at night. Why should they? It
is just a stone barn with no obvious means of entry. Look into my
cupboard!"</p>
<p>Charles glanced over his companion's shoulder. There was coffee equipment
but no signs of any coffee. There was a very small piece of black bread on a
plate and not another thing.</p>
<p>"I slept here last night," Blute confided. "I munched at that piece of bread
when I got up and there it remains. I washed my face and hands in the basin
opposite and I walked all the way up into the city. I served coffee during the
rush hour at a caf&eacute; <i>en route</i> and there I got a mugful for myself
and a roll in payment for half-an-hour's work. It was my breakfast. My
<i>mittagessen</i> did not exist. My dinner I will not speak about! I am
fortunately a man&mdash;as you would be, I think, Mr. Mildenhall&mdash;who
finds humour in violent contrasts."</p>
<p>He closed up the cupboard.</p>
<p>"Now for some more magic!"</p>
<p>He moved across to the middle of the floor and stooped down, pressed a
certain spot in the corner of a square slab of ancient paving-stone, and a
trap-door fell slowly back. Charles followed his guide down a ladder with iron
rungs into another large but perfectly dry apartment. Blute held up his
torch.</p>
<p>"Take a pull on yourself here," he advised. "For the first moment you may
not like it."</p>
<p>Charles followed him confidently. Blute raised his arm and the light from
his torch partially illuminated the place. Against the wall, side by side, were
four deep coffins. The black cloths which had covered them were neatly piled by
their sides. Charles stared at them wonderingly.</p>
<p>"Defunct Gestapos?" he enquired. "Or have we here other enemies? Are these
the results of a battle in the Catacombs?"</p>
<p>Blute smiled.</p>
<p>"You are a bad guesser, Mr. Mildenhall," he said. "Within these coffins are
some of the Old Masters which were the joy of Mr. Benjamin's life."</p>
<p>"Awaiting exportation," Charles murmured.</p>
<p>"Precisely."</p>
<p>"Won't that be just a little difficult?"</p>
<p>"Not if our plans work smoothly. Consider what might happen. A shocking
skiing or automobile disaster&mdash;a car rushing down, say, to catch the last
train to the frontier. Four over a precipice. Fine description written the same
afternoon in a well-known Viennese sporting paper. At the end of the column
there is a notice that the bodies of the four victims are being conveyed to
France for burial."</p>
<p>"I am confused," Charles admitted.</p>
<p>"It's clear enough," Blute pointed out patiently. "These are supposed to
contain the bodies of the four young men. We have the tickets for the transport
of the coffins. Remember that no notice has yet appeared in the papers
concerning the accident. The day before we are ready to ship the coffins the
account of the supposed accident will be published in the Viennese paper. As I
said before, the accident never did happen and will be contradicted a week
later. A stiff sum that little fairy story will cost but it will be worth
it."</p>
<p>"Are those part of the game?" Charles asked, pointing to three large cases.
"They seem to have the Customs chalk mark on them already."</p>
<p>"Another little idea," Blute explained. "Those cases contain tapestry and
some of the small <i>objets d'art</i>, including some miniatures that Mr.
Benjamin is very anxious to have. I will tell you how they happen to be in
their present condition. The Austrian Railway has a terribly bad name for the
low wages it pays to its employees. At the Swiss frontier there are two Customs
officials whose addresses I carry with me and whom I have only to advise of my
coming. I have to arrange to travel by a train on which the <i>Chef de
Bagages</i> is a certain Jean Pfeiffer, with whom I am acquainted. It was he
who put me up to this in the first place. When we arrive at the frontier he
will put these out of the train as usual but they will not be carried to the
Customs shed where the luggage is opened. They will be glanced at and when no
official is in sight they will be put back again upon the train in their old
place&mdash;the first packages passed by the Customs."</p>
<p>"Ingenious." Charles observed.</p>
<p>"You see, the point is," Blute went on, "Mr. Benjamin wants the contents of
those cases. If by any chance the fraud were detected, they would be at the
frontier, it would be the Swiss side which would take care of them and the
consignee would be able to get possession of them by paying a heavy fine. If
they remained in Austria the Nazis would confiscate them and Mr. Benjamin would
never see them again."</p>
<p>"It all seems to me like a very cleverly thought-out scheme," Charles
admitted. "The only thing is&mdash;why have you left it so long? If there is a
declaration of war within the next few days&mdash;and there will be&mdash;there
will be a tremendous rush of people across the frontier and you will find it
difficult to get away."</p>
<p>Blute, for once in his life, spoke as a man might speak who was accustomed
to lose control of his temper. He even raised his voice. His soft, low
intonation was gone. He almost shouted.</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ!" he cried. "Can't you realize, sir, can't you realize, Mr.
Mildenhall, the agony through which that little girl and I have awakened in the
morning and crawled to meet one another? No news&mdash;no fresh
face&mdash;nothing at the post&mdash;nothing at the Censor's office&mdash;and
every day that passed brought us nearer disaster. We have everything planned
and, simple though it may now seem, it has taken some planning and some
scheming. And then we come face to face with this horrible position. For the
final expenses we have not one penny between us! We have no money with which to
bribe the undertaker and his men who are to take the coffins to the station, we
have no money for our own tickets, we still have the guard and the Customs men
to arrange with. We are helpless!"</p>
<p><i>"You</i> were helpless," Charles said, patting him on the shoulder. "Why,
it must have been maddening, Blute. Thank heavens I came along."</p>
<p>Blute sat down on one of the cases. For the first time he seemed in some
small degree to lose control of himself. His face twitched. Charles looked away
quickly but he could almost have sworn that there were tears in the man's
eyes.</p>
<p>"Maddening it has been these last few weeks," he went on. "Listen, Mr.
Mildenhall, I must tell you that it was I who transferred Leopold Benjamin's
whole fortune from Germany and Austria to America and London. It was I who
thought out the schemes for transference, who guarded against the currency
troubles, who completed the whole business. I can assure you it was child's
play compared to these schemes which Miss Grey and I between us have perfected
to bring Mr. Benjamin back his treasures. We are on the point of success.
Everything is arranged and the money does not come. We have been robbed of what
we had and now all the banks have closed their doors firmly against anyone who
needs money in this country. I am not a beggar, Mr. Mildenhall, no more is that
child a beggar, but last night I was playing a tin-pot little violin in a
lowdown caf&eacute; to earn a wretched dinner which I shared with the child;
and as for finishing our work here&mdash;it is ruined, all brought to nothing
for the need of a few thousand pounds."</p>
<p>"Steady on," Charles begged. "My dear fellow," he went on kindly, "wipe your
face&mdash;do. I know it sounds terrible, but listen&mdash;that all belongs to
the past. I'm coming in with you. I'll risk all the money I can raise for you
and I'm perfectly certain that even now I can get all you want. I'll travel
with you. I'll take the whole adventure on. You and I and Patricia&mdash;we'll
fool these fellows, we'll cheat the Customs and we'll make that old man
happy."</p>
<p>"You mean that, Mr. Mildenhall?" Blute asked hoarsely. "For God's sake don't
fool about with me."</p>
<p>"I do mean it," Charles assured him. "I can be useful to you in many ways. I
have a pull with the railway and the Customs. I have a diplomatic passport as
well as my own. We will devote to-morrow&mdash;or rather to-day&mdash;to
deciding the train we travel on. You can get the story of the terrible accident
into the paper at once. Here&mdash;wipe your face&mdash;there's a good fellow.
I have never known you to raise your voice before. Use my handkerchief. I have
a spare one. You will need all your nerve for the next few days."</p>
<p>The smile came back to Blute's lips. He led the way up the ladder to the
main room, bent down, closed the trap-door and standing up again moved slowly
towards the exit.</p>
<p>"My friend, I am ashamed," he said humbly. "For the moment I forgot. Do you
really mean it? You will come to our aid, you will be once more our
deliverer?"</p>
<p>"Of course I mean it. I've promised. To-morrow morning you must come
straight to my room at Sacher's. We will work out just how much money we shall
need. We shall have the help of the hotel in getting the places on the train.
Everything will be easy...Now what's the matter?"</p>
<p>The smile had already disappeared from Blute's lips. There was fear on his
face, horror in his eyes. The door was slowly being pushed open. Fritz crept
onto the threshold and was standing there, his face as white as a ghost's.</p>
<p>"<i>Mein Herr</i>," he cried softly. "A man has been down the lane. He came
quietly but he carried a torch. I had no time to get to you or to get away
before he saw the taxicab. I hid behind it. He called out. I did not answer. I
heard him mumbling to himself. He stepped out into the lane again and I heard
him calling. He is coming down&mdash;they are coming here&mdash;two of them.
They are S.S. men! <i>Ach, mein Herr!</i>"</p>
<p>The gift of swift thought had helped Charles Mildenhall through more than
one crisis of his life.</p>
<p>"Come inside and get behind the door, Fritz," he ordered. "Don't close it.
Leave it open. We'll deal with these men."</p>
<p>"I have a revolver&mdash;in the car," Fritz stammered.</p>
<p>"Leave it there," Charles answered. "I have one in my pocket!"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-15" id="ch-15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p>The intruders displayed none of Fritz's hesitation. They pushed the door
noisily open and stood staring about them. They were both hefty fellows, one in
a well-worn German S.S. uniform, the other in a newer outfit of the same type
with the Swastika prominently displayed. They had only one rather poor torch
between them carried by the Austrian.</p>
<p>"What are you men doing in this place?" the latter asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>Charles was on the point of answering him when Blute gripped his arm.</p>
<p>"Let me deal with this," he begged, speaking in English. "I know how to
handle these fellows better than you would. Besides, I want you to keep out of
it as much as you can."</p>
<p>"It's too late to think of that," Charles replied. "Still, go ahead, my
friend. If you have an idea how to deal with this situation you're welcome.
Anything short of murder&mdash;don't forget that."</p>
<p>"Turn on the lights!" the bigger man shouted. "I want to see what sort of
place we're in."</p>
<p>"There are no lights, Herr Gestapo," Blute answered. "You'll have to do as
well as you can with your torch. What do you want here, anyway? This is private
property."</p>
<p>The German took the torch away from his companion and inspected the place as
far as he could. His language became blasphemous.</p>
<p>"What in hell is a place like this for&mdash;stone walls&mdash;stone
roof&mdash;stone floor and not a light?"</p>
<p>"It's a prison/' Blute explained.</p>
<p>"A prison for whom?" the Austrian asked contemptuously.</p>
<p>"You, if you don't behave yourself," was the quick response. "Now, put your
hands up&mdash;both of you&mdash;quick!"</p>
<p>Blute drew a clumsy, old-fashioned revolver from his pocket and held it out.
The weapon which Charles had been hiding behind his back also appeared. It was
a highly modern, beautifully polished affair.</p>
<p>"Put your revolver away," Blute told him. "I could hit their eyeballs if I
wanted to from here. They aren't armed, you see. They've got nothing but those
steel whips with knobs at the end&mdash;wicked weapons but no good except at
close quarters."</p>
<p>"Do you know we are Gestapo?" the German shouted. "You'll go to prison for
this!"</p>
<p>"And you'll go to hell, if you don't keep your mouth shut," Blute retorted.
"Want some plain talk or a bullet, you two?"</p>
<p>"Proceed with the plain talk," the Austrian demanded. "Put your revolver
down. We are not armed."</p>
<p>"So I see, but I will keep my revolver in my hand. I earned my living once
as a trick shot on the stage. I could put a bullet in either of you any place I
chose within a couple of millimetres. And, while I'm about it, get this into
your brains if you've got any&mdash;we've been working here for some time and
we're not going to be disturbed. There are two things you can do. You'd better
stand still and listen to them. If you make the slightest attempt to escape you
are dead men and I can promise we can hide your bodies in this building in such
a way that they will never be found until the rats have eaten the flesh off
your bones."</p>
<p>"They'll be taking a dislike to you presently," Charles muttered <i>sotto
voce</i>.</p>
<p>"You leave me alone," Blute whispered. "I know the breed. Now then, you
fellows," he went on, "you may put your hands down. I'm not afraid of your
rushing in. You want to know what we are. We're thieves. This place has been
empty for years, there isn't a soul living anywhere near and we've used it for
a hiding place. We've still got some loot here to carry away. It will take us
two or three days. Until we've taken it right away you'll stay where you
are.</p>
<p>"What, in this place?" the German called out.</p>
<p>"In this place," Blute repeated. "And you can be thankful you're not down in
one of the cellars with a bullet through your forehead."</p>
<p>The Austrian coughed. His small eyes were glazed with fear.</p>
<p>"I think we'd better come to an arrangement," he suggested. "I'm an S.S. man
all right&mdash;so is my friend&mdash;but we all have to live. If we were free
we would arrest you. As we are not, we will not be so silly as to try. Make it
worth our while and we'll clear out."</p>
<p>"There's another Austrian alive," Blute observed with a grin, "whose word I
wouldn't trust for five minutes. I fancy you two are about the same kidney.
There may be something coming to you afterwards if you behave yourselves, but I
wouldn't trust either of you further than I could see you. Come on&mdash;I'm
not much of a talker&mdash;no more is my friend. We like things to happen. Take
your choice. Are you going to obey us or are you going to share the contents of
this revolver of mine?"</p>
<p>"You've got us," the German said sulkily. "We'll do as you say, provided
there's no killing."</p>
<p>"There'll be no killing unless you ask for it. You came here of your own
choice&mdash;you'll leave when we choose."</p>
<p>"When will that be?" the Austrian asked uneasily.</p>
<p>"Possibly in either four or five days."</p>
<p>The stream of blasphemy from the German left him for a moment incapable of
coherent speech. The Austrian kept his head and temper.</p>
<p>"What do we live on for those four days?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"Sausages, beef, rolls, butter, coffee, beer and brandy," was the prompt
response.</p>
<p>"Where do they come from?" the German growled.</p>
<p>"You will be provided with food&mdash;just as much as you can eat," Blute
promised, "and drink&mdash;just as much as you can put away&mdash;provided you
make no attempt to communicate with anyone outside."</p>
<p>There was a cunning gleam in the big man's eye. It was easy to guess at the
thought behind it. Blute flashed his torch upon him.</p>
<p>"By whatever means these things are brought to you," he said, "it will be in
such a fashion that you will be dead in ten seconds if you try any tricks."</p>
<p>The German scowled. This wizard of a man seemed to have read his thoughts.
His companion raised his voice in excitement.</p>
<p>"<i>Mein Herr</i>," he promised, "I will look after Adolf here. I am not
going to have my life risked by his folly. I don't care if you are a thief, I
don't care how much you get away with, I don't mind anything as long as we
aren't hurt and we get our liberty in four or five days and something in our
pockets for keeping quiet."</p>
<p>"Same here," the German echoed gruffly, but without quite as much sincerity
ringing in his voice.</p>
<p>"Now, tell me this," Blute asked, turning slightly towards Charles but
keeping a stern watch upon the two intruders. "You said that Fritz is to be
trusted. Do you mean that absolutely and entirely?"</p>
<p>"I mean that I trust him as completely," Charles replied, "as I should you
yourself or Miss Grey."</p>
<p>"The matter, then, is easy," Blute decided. "Fritz," he went on, "your
master wants to speak to you."</p>
<p>The two men in uniform started. Fritz appeared from the shadows. There was a
somewhat self-conscious smile upon his face. He pointed to the Austrian Nazi as
he approached.</p>
<p>"My cousin," he announced, "Johann Lehrer. He was not so bad until he joined
the Gestapo."</p>
<p>"Fritz!" the other exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Relations, eh?" Blute queried.</p>
<p>"I speak the truth," Fritz said. "He is the son of my mother's sister."</p>
<p>"Family ties, eh?" Blute observed. "Well, that may help. Now listen. Fritz,
I take it," he added, turning to Charles, "is entirely at our disposal for the
next four or five days, if necessary?"</p>
<p>"He will do whatever we tell him," Charles answered. "His trustworthiness is
guaranteed."</p>
<p>"This, then, is what will happen," Blute announced. "In the first place
Fritz will drive us back to the hotel. We shall leave you there," he went on,
touching Mildenhall on the arm. "I hope you will have the night's sleep you
deserve. Fritz and I will drive on to the all-night market. Listen," he
continued, beckoning to the two others, "you can come a little nearer. First,
perhaps, it would be better if you took your belts off and got rid of those
ugly-looking weapons."</p>
<p>The two Nazis did as they were bidden. They had lost all fear now and it was
obvious that they were intrigued.</p>
<p>"In the all-night market," Blute went on, "Fritz will purchase for you all
the provisions I have mentioned or anything else you prefer. He will then drive
back to this place, he will open the door with his revolver in one hand and
pass over the provisions to you. He will then lock you up again. He can provide
you with journals which he will buy on the way down. Let this be clearly
understood. You have your provisions and your drinks and you will be locked up
here alone."</p>
<p>"With the provisions and drinks?" the German repeated in a stentorian
voice.</p>
<p>"Precisely."</p>
<p>"And tobacco?"</p>
<p>"And tobacco," Blute assented. "Later in the day Fritz will return. This
time he may bring you wine and perhaps a can of hot meat. You will be well fed
in any case. That is understood. He may be accompanied by men who will do some
removal work. That is not for you to notice. Whatever they may appear to be,
these men are on our side, and if you appeal to them in any way the chapter
will be closed. You will go out of the world probably with a bullet in your
body and you will have thrown your lives away to no purpose."</p>
<p>"We shall not do that," the German declared. "I am not in love with my job.
We will follow the directions. We are listening."</p>
<p>"For two or three days you may see either this gentleman who is with me or
myself at any time. Then the moment will come when we shall leave the city.
Fritz here will remain. There will be twenty-four hours' interval after we have
left, during which you will have your usual supply of food and papers, drink
and tobacco. At the end of that time Fritz will place in your hands a certain
sum of money each."</p>
<p>"What will that sum be?" the German asked, his blue eyes greedily eager.</p>
<p>"One thousand reichsmarks each."</p>
<p>The two men were speechless. The Austrian was the first to find words.</p>
<p>"How do we know that we will get it?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"You can surely trust your relative," Blute replied. "We are giving him his
own present separately and we will hand him one thousand reichsmarks for each
of you two. You hear that, Fritz?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, sir," the chauffeur answered. "I can tell you both," he went on.
"One of you I don't know but the other is my cousin and he knows very well that
I have been an honest man all my life and always kept my word. These gentlemen
will keep theirs. I know that much about them. They will give me the thousand
reichsmarks for each of you and I will hand it over to you. You are very lucky
fellows!"</p>
<p>"There is one thing left," Blute reflected. "In this you will have to
concern yourselves a little. How will you account for your absence to your
principals?"</p>
<p>Johann, the Austrian, simply grinned.</p>
<p>"With me that is easy," he confided. "I shall offer a princely gift to my
sergeant. I shall offer him five reichsmarks. He will enter me in his book as
on duty. My comrade here is in my charge. For another five he will enter him
also as having been in my company."</p>
<p>"You have no wives or anything of that sort?" Blute asked.</p>
<p>An ecstatic smile broke over the German's face. The Austrian's grin was
seraphic.</p>
<p>"The little Lizette," he muttered to himself. "I have dreamed of this! No,
<i>mein Herr</i>," he went on, turning to Blute, "we have no wives and we sleep
in the barracks, but I think I can promise you that we shall have a wife each
in five days' time."</p>
<p>"I have no wife or sweetheart in Germany," the other said, "and these
Austrian women&mdash;they are lovely."</p>
<p>"Well," Charles said, after a momentary pause, "that all seems to be happily
arranged. You'd better change your plans now, Blute, and come back with
me."</p>
<p>"I think you're right," Blute agreed, "although they'd get the shock of
their lives if they set out to rob me! A staff room in the back quarters of the
hotel will seem like a palace after this place."</p>
<p>Charles emptied his cigarette case between the two prisoners. Blute pointed
out his water tap and the bed.</p>
<p>"In an hour," he promised them, "Fritz will be back with the food. The one
thing you must not do, either of you, is to try and leave this place."</p>
<p>They helped themselves greedily to the cigarettes.</p>
<p>"We will sit and wait," the German promised. "And let it not be too
long&mdash;I am hungry."</p>
<p>"For me," Johann confided, "I shall dream of Lizette. I shall smoke many
cigarettes which will give me a glorious thirst. When the beer
comes&mdash;<i>ach</i>!"</p>
<p>Blute drew a deep sigh of relief as he locked the outer door and bared his
head to the gently falling rain.</p>
<p>"Now at last," he murmured beatifically, "I begin to allow myself hope."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-16" id="ch-16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p>Charles Mildenhall's very pleasant salon, soon after nine o'clock on the
following morning, resembled something between a tourists' bureau and the
enquiry office of a great newspaper. In a remote corner sat Blute with a map
spread out before him, a directory and a heap of notepaper by his side. Down
below in the square bells were ringing, military bands playing and large
detachments of German troops who had taken part in the formal entry into Vienna
marched through the streets for re-embarkation to Poland. The crowds were on
the whole apathetic, but the German side of the Gestapo were doing their best
to whip them into some sort of enthusiasm. Charles had established several
contacts with his friends in London and elsewhere, and telegrams in various
foreign languages were streaming in. Amongst others was a rather curt
intimation from the Foreign Office in London that his return to that capital
was greatly desired. Patricia, who was in her element amidst the stream of
communications, handed him the British telegram, which was not in code, a
little anxiously.</p>
<p>"I expected that," he remarked, "but it can't be helped. I've never taken a
liberty with the authorities in my life and in this case it's only a matter of
days. Lascelles is really my senior and I have loaded him up with every scrap
of information I had."</p>
<p>"I do hope you won't get into trouble," she sighed. "It's marvellous what
you are doing for us."</p>
<p>"My dear," he assured her, "I'm enjoying it. When I think of last night I
realize how empty life has seemed without an adventure of this sort...Come in,
Mr. Herodin," he called out as the manager appeared on the threshold. "Sorry to
insist upon seeing you but it was necessary. Blute, you had better come and
join in this consultation."</p>
<p>Blute rose at once and seated himself at the round table. He exchanged
greetings with the manager.</p>
<p>"Pretty busy, I expect," Blute remarked.</p>
<p>"I am glad to get out of my office for a moment or two," Herodin
confessed.</p>
<p>He sank into the chair which Charles pointed out.</p>
<p>"In the first place," the latter began, "as I gave you warning, I am going
to drain you dry of every penny you can spare in German, English and American
currencies."</p>
<p>"I quite understand that, sir, and I have brought you something to be going
on with," Herodin declared. "In reichsmarks I can do you pretty well. Then I
have some sterling and a certain amount of dollar currency."</p>
<p>He drew some wads of notes from his pocket which he passed on to
Patricia.</p>
<p>"I'll just check the amounts," she said. "Then I expect Mr. Mildenhall will
have to give you a draft on account. No one can tell exactly what the exchange
is likely to be&mdash;especially with war almost a certainty."</p>
<p>"You think war is a certainty, Mr. Mildenhall?" Herodin asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"I am afraid so. In fact I know it. At the rate they're going now Hitler's
troops will cross the frontier to-morrow. The Poles will appeal to England and
France; England will declare war first and France will follow suit. Now, Mr.
Herodin, you may wonder what I want all this money for. Well, I am not going to
tell you!"</p>
<p>"I am not curious, sir," Herodin assured his patron. "I told you that you
should have all I could spare and, of course, I had about five hundred pounds'
balance on the amount you always leave with me. I think the young lady will
find that I can spare altogether somewhere about three thousand pounds."</p>
<p>"Marvellous!" Charles exclaimed. "What do you say, Blute?"</p>
<p>"We couldn't possibly need more than that," the latter declared. "We have
some heavy expenses to face, but we shall get the whole of the money back
again."</p>
<p>"Well, Miss Grey will give you a receipt for this, Herodin," Charles said.
"I will also leave a cheque with you for about the amount in case anything
happens to us. So far as you are concerned I don't want you to think any more
about this money. You might get into trouble with the Nazis if they knew that
you were mixed up in my affairs. All that you know is that I wanted to get away
from here in a hurry, I had a great many friends who were in the same
predicament, I had a credit with you and you gave me what I asked for. The
money is the great thing, of course, but there's something else. I want every
scrap of influence I can get with the railway here and some of this money that
I am taking away from you is going to be used for what we call in the Secret
Service: 'quiet money.' My friend Mr. Blute here knows a great deal about this.
You've always done everything I wanted, of course, but I don't wish to involve
you in this matter. What about Joseph?"</p>
<p>"I really believe, sir," the manager said impressively, "that Joseph could
do even more than I could with the railway people. He knows exactly who is
approachable and who is not. You want to get to the frontier, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"With a great deal of luggage," Charles told him, "and, at the very latest,
the day after to-morrow."</p>
<p>Herodin looked grave.</p>
<p>"You must go before war is declared."</p>
<p>"That is absolutely and entirely necessary," Charles agreed. "As a matter of
fact I expect we shall be in the train when war is declared, but we must be
<i>en route</i>. Now, if I were you, Mr. Herodin, I would not have anything
more to do with us. Send Joseph up. Drag him out of his office if you must, but
I must have him here within ten minutes."</p>
<p>"The people are standing ten or a dozen deep round his bureau," the manager
confided. "I'll have to get him out at the back through my office."</p>
<p>"You must do it, Herodin," Charles insisted cheerfully. "Drag him out by
those nice fat little ears of his, if you have to. I shall be down below very
soon and I will bring in your cheque."</p>
<p>"Very good, sir. By the by," Herodin added, rising to his feet, "I forgot to
mention it in all this excitement but there has been a terrible motor accident
in the north. Four or five young people&mdash;all Americans, I
believe&mdash;have lost their lives."</p>
<p>Charles and Blute exchanged significant glances.</p>
<p>"Dear me, I'm very sorry to hear that," the former remarked. "Racing down
here to get out of Austria, I suppose."</p>
<p>"Some of the roads coming south," Herodin observed, "are in a very poor
state just now and very dangerous...I'll send Joseph right away, Mr.
Mildenhall."</p>
<p>"And could you send us up a paper with an account of the accident?" Blute
asked eagerly. "I have some friends up north."</p>
<p>"They're selling the papers in the streets now, sir," the manager declared.
"I'll get one and send it up at once."</p>
<p>He departed, closing the door quietly behind him. Charles grinned as he took
a cigarette from the box on the table and lit it.</p>
<p>"That's quick work!" he exclaimed. "How did you manage it?"</p>
<p>"I've had the particulars of the accident written out for several months,"
Blute confided. "When you went into the cable office on your way up here I
slipped into the newspaper bureau and caught my friend just going in. I'm sorry
to seem a little precipitate, Mr. Mildenhall," he went on, "but to tell you the
truth, my friend, the journalist, is sitting downstairs waiting. He's afraid he
may get the sack if the truth leaks out."</p>
<p>"So he wants the money quick," Charles observed.</p>
<p>"Wise fellow. How much for half a column of lurid tragedy?"</p>
<p>"Well, I told him it would be worth five hundred reichsmarks to him."</p>
<p>"If you please, young lady," Charles said, holding out his hand.</p>
<p>Patricia counted out the notes and gave them to him. Charles passed them on
to Blute, who stuffed them into his pocket.</p>
<p>"If you will excuse me," he begged, "I'll just finish with that young man. I
must get a few copies of the paper, too," he added, hurrying off.<br>
<br></p>
<p>Charles and his companion were suddenly amazingly aware of each other's
presence. Patricia rose to her feet. Never in the world had she found speech so
difficult. Forever afterwards, mingled with her gratitude and her genuine
affection for him, she was conscious of those few moments of deep and sincere
admiration for his supreme tact.</p>
<p>"Any time that fat old lady in the silk dress and the starched manners wants
a testimonial," Charles declared, "she can have it from me. Do you know,
Patricia," he said, leaning back in his chair and regarding her critically,
"notwithstanding the fact that you possess charm of a very peculiar and
distinctive order, a fact I have no doubt men have been telling you of ever
since you crawled out of your cradle, I never saw you look so well as you do at
the present moment. That black and white checked gown you are wearing fits
marvellously and the little bit of lace at your throat is an inspiration. How
on earth did you get your hair to look like that? All its fire back in a
moment&mdash;and really a little colour in your cheeks."</p>
<p>"Extravagance with your money, I'm afraid," she laughed. "Do you know that
in the small hours of the morning I looked at myself in the looking-glass and
ten minutes after the maid came to wake me I had a <i>coiffeur</i> in the
room&mdash;at your expense!"</p>
<p>"Starvation," he observed, "agrees with you."</p>
<p>"Thank you," she answered. "I don't want to try it again."</p>
<p>"I'll see that you don't!"</p>
<p>It was too much. The tears were in her eyes.</p>
<p>"I shall have several small attacks like this," she warned him with a little
choke. "Don't take any notice of them, please."</p>
<p>"I was just thinking," he remarked, "that I should like to kiss that one
away."</p>
<p>"You can do just as you like," she said, moving her handkerchief from her
eyes and looking at him.</p>
<p>There was no doubt whatever about his inclinations or the exquisite touch of
her arms around his neck. There was no doubt at all, either, about the
sincerity of his imprecation at the sound of that stiff official knocking at
the door. He drew quickly away.</p>
<p>"Come in!"</p>
<p>Joseph, the world-famed <i>concierge</i> of one of the most famous hotels in
Europe, entered the room cap in hand. He was a large, rotund person whose
spreading stomach was scarcely noticeable, owing to his upright carriage and
agile movements. He had the face of a Napoleon and the smile of a Cheeryble
brother. The supreme unconsciousness of his manner was in itself proof positive
of his diplomatic gifts.</p>
<p>"Mr. Mildenhall, sir," he said, "I am told that you have urgent need of
me."</p>
<p>"I have indeed, Joseph," Charles replied. "I do not suppose that anyone in
this world has ever been in such need of you."</p>
<p>"Anything that I can do for you, sir, has always been a great pleasure," the
man assured him.</p>
<p>"It isn't deeds I require, it's miracles."</p>
<p>"I am at your service, sir."</p>
<p>"Very well. I want a special luggage van attached to the earliest possible
train to Innsbruck and Switzerland and I also want three first-class tickets on
the same train."</p>
<p>The smile slowly faded from Joseph's lips.</p>
<p>"Mr. Mildenhall!" he exclaimed. "May I ask you one question?"</p>
<p>"Go ahead."</p>
<p>"Do you realize that if things proceed as now seems inevitable, the morning
train to-morrow will be the last train to leave Austrian territory before the
declaration of war?"</p>
<p>"Better than you do, Joseph, because I know for a fact what you only
surmise. You are quite right. That is the last train which will leave
Austro-German territory before the declaration of war and that is why it is
absolutely imperative that I and my friends travel by it together with the
special luggage truck."</p>
<p>"You wouldn't care to risk your plane, I suppose, Mr. Mildenhall?" Joseph
suggested.</p>
<p>"My plane is at the present moment on its way over from England," Charles
replied. "It is bound for Switzerland and it wouldn't carry a tenth part of the
luggage."</p>
<p>"I have at the present moment," Joseph confided, "nearly a hundred people
around my desk demanding accommodations by that train. Of telephone calls I
take no account. There are about the same number."</p>
<p>"Seems to be quite a rush of people wanting to get away," Charles
observed.</p>
<p>"For many of them," the <i>concierge</i> replied, "it is a question of
getting away or being interned."</p>
<p>"You wouldn't like that to happen to me, Joseph, I'm sure?</p>
<p>"I should not, sir," was the devout answer, "but I do not think it is
possible, because you are a diplomatic gentleman."</p>
<p>"No use nowadays. Our Embassy here is broken up. Then there are my friends
and the luggage."</p>
<p>"Would the luggage be very heavy, sir?"</p>
<p>"Let me see&mdash;the weight of four people might be&mdash;what do you
think, Blute?"</p>
<p>"I do not think," Blute, who had just re-entered the room, replied, "that
you need reckon it that way. Together with the weight of the guard of four men
I can assure our friend here that the weight would be less than half what any
ordinary luggage truck is supposed to carry."</p>
<p>"What does the gentleman mean by a guard, sir?" Joseph asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"I rather forgot that, I'm afraid," Charles confessed. "Can't carry
everything in your mind, though, these unusual times. Would you work for us,
Joseph, with more confidence if I let you into a secret as regards the proposed
contents of that truck?"</p>
<p>"It certainly would be helpful, sir."</p>
<p>"Very well. Do you happen to have read the special edition of the paper?" he
asked, taking one from the roll upon the table which Blute had brought up and
holding it out. "There has been a terrible accident to some motorists driving
here from Moravia. They were apparently in as great a hurry as we are to get
out of the country. The chief contents of this luggage van will be four large
coffins."</p>
<p>Joseph's equanimity was for once troubled. He gazed incredulously at the
speaker.</p>
<p>"Coffins?" he repeated.</p>
<p>"Caskets which contain the remains of these four unfortunate people,"
Charles said gravely. "Quick work, isn't it? I can explain that, though. This
accident happened several days ago, but the Press have only just got hold of
it. The four guards who will travel with the coffins are the representatives of
the undertakers. We shall want tickets for them, of course."</p>
<p>Joseph coughed and looked up towards the ceiling. When he spoke again there
was a faint change in his manner.</p>
<p>"As I presume you know, sir," he remarked, "the linings of the coffins would
be of lead, to conform with the regulations. This would add considerably to the
weight. Then there are the four guards. Nearly all the undertakers' assistants
whom I have ever come across," he went on thoughtfully, "have been small,
straggly types of men&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I hope these won't be anything of the sort," Charles interrupted, "but
anyhow, I think that my friend Mr. Blute over here is right when he says that
the weight will not be a difficulty. The tickets for the four guards I shall
require as a matter of course. Even though they must travel in the luggage
truck I have no desire to smuggle them out of the country. This is a perfectly
straightforward transaction, you understand, Joseph, carried out at the desire
of the&mdash;er&mdash;relations."</p>
<p>Joseph's eyes once more sought the ceiling. They lingered there for a
moment. When they came down his gaze was perfectly respectful, his tone gently
enquiring.</p>
<p>"I am well aware of the regulation rates for merchandise, Mr. Mildenhall,"
he said, "but I think if by any miraculous means I was able to put this affair
through for you the charges would be something in excess of the ordinary."</p>
<p>Charles smiled&mdash;a very understanding gesture.</p>
<p>"I think that you are probably right, Joseph," he acknowledged. "Now, if you
should be successful in carrying this little affair through and procuring for
me a compartment in the train, or, at any rate, three first-class seats, I
would show my appreciation of the fact that the charges of a miracle-monger
must necessarily be high. I should hand over to you, Joseph, a sum which would
roughly represent a thousand pounds in English money. I should look upon it as
being necessary to dispense a considerable portion of this amongst the
officials of the railway company&mdash;what proportion I should have to leave
to your judgment. The balance of the thousand pounds would belong to you. Miss
Grey," he added, turning round, "the equivalent of one thousand pounds sterling
in reichsmarks, if you please. Now, Joseph," he concluded, "I would suggest
that before your luncheon hour you take a little carriage down to the railway
station, fill your pockets with cigars and interview your friends."</p>
<p>"The guard of the train," Joseph reflected, "will be at his house for his
day off before the journey. He is a very good friend of mine. Something, of
course, might be arranged, but the station authorities will also require a
little special information. The length of the train is probably already
prodigious. I think your idea is a good one, Mr. Mildenhall. I will see what I
can do personally. In any case sir," he wound up, picking up his cap from the
chair, "if I fail I shall have to introduce a new word into my vocabulary. I
shall report as soon as possible. <i>Fr&auml;ulein</i>, Herr Mildenhall, Herr
Blute, I wish you good morning."</p>
<p>"One of nature's dictators," was Charles's only remark after the door was
closed.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-17" id="ch-17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<p>The church clock on the other side of the square struck eleven as Joseph
left the salon. Charles glanced at his watch with a slight frown.</p>
<p>"At what time was Fritz to report to us this morning?" he asked.</p>
<p>There was the same faint trace of uneasiness in Blute's expression as he
answered.</p>
<p>"Half-past ten he was to have been here. If that clock is right it is eleven
o'clock."</p>
<p>The frown upon Charles's forehead deepened.</p>
<p>"It isn't like Fritz to be even five minutes late," he remarked. "You took
him to the night market after you left me, I suppose?"</p>
<p>Blute smiled at the recollection.</p>
<p>"I not only did that but I took him round to the stalls. First of all we
bought the largest basket you could imagine and then Fritz, who knew what he
was about, I must say, filled it. I won't disturb your early morning appetites
with all the details, but there was sausage, there was ham, there was
<i>p&acirc;t&eacute;</i>, there was jam, there were rolls, butter, wine,
beer&mdash;everything you can think of. Then I bought a little cheap crockery
and packed him back in the taxi. He had made up his mind to stop and share the
feast, I think, but anyway he promised to visit them early this morning with
coffee and rolls and be here punctually."</p>
<p>"At what time was he to have been here?" Charles asked again.</p>
<p>"At half-past ten. Still, the streets are very-crowded and he might easily
be held up."</p>
<p>"Will my adorable secretary telephone down and ask if the taxicab for Mr.
Mildenhall has arrived?" Charles suggested.</p>
<p>Patricia obeyed with a slight grimace. She set down the receiver a moment
later.</p>
<p>"Your man has just arrived," she announced. "He is on his way up."</p>
<p>They were all a trifle uneasy and there was a prompt response to the
expected knock at the door. A glance at Fritz as he entered the room was
sufficient to show them that something had happened. He was walking with a
decided limp. He closed the door behind him carefully and advanced to the
centre of the room.</p>
<p>"What's gone wrong?" Charles asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"<i>Ach, mein Herr</i>," Fritz faltered, "I do not think that it was my
fault. Wait, and I shall tell my story. The service steps are steep and I did
not take the lift. I didn't want to attract any attention."</p>
<p>"What is the trouble?" Blute demanded.</p>
<p>"I will tell my story," Fritz repeated.</p>
<p>Charles made a sign towards the door. Blute hurried over and locked it.
Fritz pointed to him.</p>
<p>"Together," he began, "we bought much that was good last night to eat and to
drink. The Herr Blute left me and I drove back to where the two Gestapo were
waiting for me. All seemed well. I opened the door quietly. The two were
playing cards by the light of the torch. When they saw the basket they howled
with joy. The German was like a wild animal. My cousin&mdash;he is thin to look
at but he eats as no other I have ever seen. I opened the wine, put out the
crockery the <i>Herr</i> here had bought and I took leave of them. My cousin,
he wished me good night without looking up from his plate; the German, his
mouth was too full to speak. They never even looked out as I passed through the
door. They were safe. I locked them in."</p>
<p>Fritz paused for breath. His voice was becoming steadier. He leaned
forward.</p>
<p>"This morning at nine o'clock I left my car in that corner where it is out
of sight, I crossed the yard, I listened for a moment. It seemed to me then
that everything was very quiet. I opened the door very carefully, as Mr. Blute
had shown me. The moment it was a few inches open, out came a great hand and
seized me by the collar. I was dragged in. It was the German! He was grinning
like a fat, fair devil. In his left hand he held the revolver my cousin had
prayed me to leave with him. There were no signs of Johann about the place, but
the remains of their supper were all there. There were broken plates, glasses,
a stain where wine had been spilt and food lying about. The German plumped me
up against the wall.</p>
<p>"'Now then,' he shouted, 'there is some secret about this place. There's
money here or stolen goods. What is it? Where is it? No good your twitching
about like that. You'll tell the truth or you'll go where your cousin has
gone.'</p>
<p>"'Have you killed him?' I asked.</p>
<p>"He grinned at me. When I think of that grin I can forgive myself for
everything!</p>
<p>"'You can look for him when I've done with you, if you can crawl so far,' he
sneered. 'You didn't think when you left him your revolver that I might take a
fancy to it, eh?'</p>
<p>"It was then, at that moment, Herr Mildenhall&mdash;Herr Blute," Fritz
continued, "that my brain began to work a little. The German's eyes were red,
his face was all patchy. The bottle of wine we had brought, the beer bottles
and the brandy bottle were all lying on the floor empty&mdash;except for the
brandy. There was just that much left of the brandy," Fritz went on, holding up
three fingers. "The German was still half drunk but he was terribly determined.
I was sure that he had murdered Johann. There was bloodshed in his eyes when he
looked at me. I think he was aching to swing that revolver up into line and
shoot me. He began to shuffle a little nearer.</p>
<p>"'I know nothing about this place,' I told him. 'I brought the gentleman who
sent you your supper up here. He's been living in this room.'</p>
<p>"The German jeered at me.</p>
<p>"'Him live here? What for? To guard something. If he lived here in a hole
like this, there's treasure about. I'll&mdash;'</p>
<p>"He hiccuped. He made noise enough doing it to awaken the dead," Fritz went
on, his face whiter than ever, his eyes glaring. "Then he retched and vomited
right across the room. The effort made him stagger. He dropped the
revolver."</p>
<p>They were all three very quiet indeed. Their eyes were fixed upon the
chauffeur.</p>
<p>"It was a clumsy thing," he said. "It rolled over on the floor. I am good on
my feet. I jumped. Oh, it was a long jump! I hit my leg against something as I
landed. I fell on the revolver&mdash;it was in my hand&mdash;he was slipping
about looking like a great angry devil. There were two chambers gone&mdash;four
left. I emptied all four into him. The first one only grazed him but the
second, third and fourth all went into his chest. He hiccuped once
more&mdash;and that was the end of him."</p>
<p>There was silence in the room. Patricia was deathly pale. Blute was wiping
the sweat from his forehead. Charles threw open the window.</p>
<p>"Well done, Fritz!" he said calmly. "You were a fool to leave the revolver
with your cousin. The rest of your story is good. Now, what about Johann?"</p>
<p>"When I saw that the German was dead," Fritz went on, "I hurried over to the
screen. Johann was lying across the bed. I think they must have been playing
cards in that spot for half the pack was scattered about the floor. He had a
bad wound on the head and a bullet wound through his shoulder, but he was still
breathing. I got him to swallow a little brandy. Then he opened his eyes. I
bathed his head and gave him some of the hot coffee. He sat up. Then he told me
that the German had stolen up behind him and hit him a blow with a bottle
whilst he was sorting his cards. He had taken the revolver, all his money and
refused to believe that Johann did not know what treasure was hidden in the
place. Johann knew no more than the German did, so in the end, in a sort of
half-drunken fury, he shot him."</p>
<p>"What became of the body?" Charles asked quietly.</p>
<p>"Johann is still alive," Fritz concluded. "I dragged him out, put him into
my cab and drove him to one of the hospitals. I said that I had picked him up
on the doorstep of a gay house early this morning. I gave a false name and
address, and they took him in."</p>
<p>"How badly are you hurt, I wonder?"</p>
<p>"I am not hurt much," Fritz replied. "A bruised leg that will make me limp
for a few days&mdash;that is all."</p>
<p>"You have given us matter for thought," Charles declared, after a brief
silence. "Go and sit in your taxicab and read the news, but be sure to keep
your car out of sight."</p>
<p>Fritz took his usual respectful leave.</p>
<p>"Good thing this didn't happen before," Charles observed, as soon as the
door was closed. "Now tell me, Blute, are there any houses about on the other
side of the lane?"</p>
<p>"There couldn't be a lonelier spot than the district around that
extraordinary building," Blute confided. "Mr. Benjamin refused to sell a yard
of the land anywhere near the palace, fortunately."</p>
<p>Charles drew a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>"Then for a short time," he proposed, "let us leave the disposal of the dead
Gestapo for further consideration. We ought to go right on with the general
scheme."</p>
<p>Patricia looked up from her desk.</p>
<p>"I quite agree," she said. "I think the next thing we ought to consider is
making arrangements for the guards who are travelling with the caskets."</p>
<p>"Even before that," Blute suggested, "we must make sure first of securing
the van."</p>
<p>"Where will you make for first when you have crossed the frontier?" asked
Charles, studying the map.</p>
<p>"Once in Switzerland," Blute answered, "I think we might pause and try to
find out Mr. Benjamin's whereabouts. By then I imagine we shall be getting to
the end of these heaven-sent resources of yours, Mr. Mildenhall."</p>
<p>Charles acquiesced.</p>
<p>"It seems a queer thing to me," he reflected, "that Mr. Benjamin should have
succeeded in disappearing so completely."</p>
<p>"He has disappeared because he is the wisest and most sagacious man I ever
met," Marius Blute said emphatically. "No possible inducement ever succeeded in
leading him to commit himself politically in any way. His whole life was an
enigma to the Nazis. All that they knew was that long before they were sure of
getting hold of Austria he was working like an alchemist getting rid of his
fortune and his investments and distributing them all over the world. I know
because it was I who was doing it for him, and their agents were on my track
every day."</p>
<p>Charles sauntered to the window and looked across once more at the church
clock.</p>
<p>"I suppose you'd think I was mad, Blute, if I suggested that Miss Grey and I
take a little stroll," he remarked.</p>
<p>Blute's expression for a moment was almost savage. He was, without a doubt,
angry.</p>
<p>"In forty-eight hours," he said, speaking very slowly and very distinctly,
"we may be absolutely free to do exactly what we like, we may be in a fortress,
we may be dead or we may have brought off one of the most amazing <i>coups</i>
the secret service of the lay world has ever known. The greatest danger we have
to face is association of the one with the other. How you, Mr. Charles
Mildenhall, whom I should call the directing brains of the enterprise, can
suggest that in this spot, which is the very centre of Nazi espionage, you and
Miss Grey&mdash;who is well known as having been the private secretary of Mr.
Benjamin&mdash;should be seen together in friendly conversation, defeats
me."</p>
<p>"I sit in sackcloth and ashes," Charles repented. "Blute, I'm afraid you are
right."</p>
<p>"In your salon here," Blute continued, "with access to the back service
stairs, we have a sanctuary. I have a room leading out to the fire escape which
I shall use instead of the stairs or lift if I think it advisable. Miss Grey
here mingles with the servants and the hired help of the establishment. You,
Mr. Mildenhall, make no attempt at concealment. You are the wealthy and
distinguished patron of the hotel. If we should by any evil chance come face to
face at any time there must not be the slightest suggestion of
recognition."</p>
<p>"I absolutely agree with Mr. Blute," Patricia said earnestly. "You are
running great and unnecessary risks for our sakes, Charles. I would never
forgive myself if anything happened in these last few hours, nor, I am sure,
would Mr. Blute."</p>
<p>"If I might make a suggestion," Blute said, "I think that a stroll across
the square and a half-hour on view alone, Mr. Mildenhall, would be an excellent
idea. I hope, too, that you will show yourself in the bar and restaurant here
as usual on every opportunity. You are a well-known figure in Vienna when you
pass through and people might very well wonder where you had spent your time
here if you are not visible at any of the show places."</p>
<p>"I am crushed," Charles acknowledged. "I will swagger about the place
presently and leave you two to go your own way for a time. If you want me,
telephone to Herodin. I'll leave word where I am. Don't stint the 'quiet
money,' Blute. Remember that an odd fifty pounds here and there may make all
the difference."</p>
<p>"You've been setting us a pretty good example of spending money," Patricia
observed, leaning forward to sniff at the bowl of roses upon the table.</p>
<p>"Roses in Vienna are like cabbages in White-chapel," he answered. "You find
them wherever you go."</p>
<p>Once more a knock at the door. Joseph made his reappearance, calm but
triumphant.</p>
<p>"<i>Mein Herr</i>," he said, addressing Charles, "I have succeeded, but I
have bought the railway! At least, so it seems to me&mdash;a poor man. I have
arranged for the van, I have arranged that it shall be attached to the eight
o'clock train to-morrow morning on one condition&mdash;that whatever you are
sending in it shall be in the yard before midnight. It is yard number seven, to
be reached from the Weltenstrasse."</p>
<p>Patricia leaned back and clapped her hands.</p>
<p>"That is precisely what we were hoping for!" she exclaimed. "Not ten minutes
ago. Monsieur Joseph, we were saying that it would be a great deal off our
minds if we could get the van linked up tonight."</p>
<p>"It is arranged," Joseph announced. "To tell you the truth,
<i>Fr&auml;ulein</i>, the guard is waiting outside. With him, too, the
preliminaries have been broached. He has consented to help in your scheme. I
must warn you, Herr Mildenhall, that you will now have to face a shock."</p>
<p>He handed over a slip of paper.</p>
<p>"For that I have bought the railway," he murmured.</p>
<p>Charles glanced at the amount and smiled.</p>
<p>"It is an amazing feat, Joseph," he declared. "On the other hand it is an
absurdity. You have bought the railway, perhaps, for our interests, but for
yourself, your wife, your children, your son's wife&mdash;what remains?
Nothing. Patricia, you must see to this. Joseph is robbing himself. You will
provide him at once with another thousand reichsmarks."</p>
<p>Joseph's bow was equal to the bow of any courtier who had ever entered the
royal palace.</p>
<p>"Monsieur is a Prince!"</p>
<p>"Bring in your guard," Charles begged. "I am being dismissed from this
assembly, Joseph, just when I am getting a little fun out of it. Bring in your
guard that I may deal with him. And wait," he went on, laying his hand upon the
man's shoulder, "when you come to fetch him away see that you are accompanied
by Frederick, the second barman in the American Bar. See that he brings with
him four carefully mixed dry Martinis still in the shaker with the ice just
dropped in, also four glasses. And Joseph, see that the glasses are not too
small. Frederick himself calls them doubles, I believe."</p>
<p>"<i>Der gn&atilde;diger Herr</i> shall be obeyed," Joseph murmured. "I fetch
now the guard. Afterwards I shall send word to Frederick."</p>
<p>He disappeared for a moment and returned ushering in a stalwart-looking
elderly official in the uniform of the Austrian Railway Company. The newcomer
carried himself in soldierly fashion. His grey hair was neatly parted, he wore
a closely clipped grey beard and he had more the appearance of a gentleman
farmer than a railway official. He carried his cap in his hand. He bowed to
Patricia, he smiled in more familiar fashion to Mr. Blute and he bowed
respectfully to Charles. He nodded a temporary farewell to Joseph, who
disappeared.</p>
<p>"I understand, Mr. Guard, that you are willing to help my two friends and
myself in a rather sad little enterprise to which we are committed," Charles
began.</p>
<p>"It will give me much satisfaction to be of service," the official replied.
"Often it has been my pleasure, Herr Mildenhall, to number you amongst my
patrons, more especially when I conducted the Orient Express. You had
diplomatic privileges and to serve you was an honour. The present occasion, I
gather, is purely a private one."</p>
<p>"Entirely so," Charles admitted. "I am here to do all that I can to help my
friend Mr. Marius Blute, who is a connection of the four young people who met
with their deaths in a motor accident three or four days ago."</p>
<p>"A sad affair," the man sighed.</p>
<p>"Mr. Blute has brought their bodies down here and the relatives are almost
passionately anxious that they should be taken to Switzerland. As you perhaps
realize, Europe to-morrow will probably again be in a state of war. We
ourselves, therefore, must pass into a neutral country."</p>
<p>"The situation presents many complications," the guard remarked
dubiously.</p>
<p>"Not so many as you would think," Charles insisted. "I am sure you will
agree with me presently that they are all capable of solution. The eight
o'clock train, which you will take charge of from here to Innsbruck and
afterwards into Switzerland, is the last train to run before the closing of the
frontiers. We have bespoken through Joseph a van for the four coffins,
accommodations for the four guards who will travel with them and a place for
three plain cases which contain the effects of the victims. These will not
require to pass through the Customs in the usual way. Nothing, therefore, need
be disturbed in the van at the frontier."</p>
<p>"If you entrust me with the carrying out of this programme," the official
promised, "you may consider the matter arranged. The only condition is that the
coffins and boxes are brought to where the van will be waiting for them on
siding number seven Weltenstrasse this evening between ten and twelve o'clock.
I have postponed a dinner of celebration which some friends were giving me to
be there in person."</p>
<p>"This gentleman here, Mr. Blute, will look after everything," Charles said.
"He will come down with the caskets himself. He will be at the place you say at
the time you name. The station van, as you know, is already arranged for."</p>
<p>"I have been warned of that by the authorities, sir," the man replied. "They
have admitted that the circumstance is entirely unusual, but it is undertaken
at the desire of a very distinguished Englishman to whom they wish to render
service."</p>
<p>The official bowed to Charles. Charles returned the courtesy.</p>
<p>"That's all clear, then," the latter said. "Now comes this important
question, my friend. We are causing you grave discomfort. We are inviting your
leniency with regard to several restrictions, as a rule imposed by your
company. We are, in short, asking you to do us a great favour. I am to ask you,
on behalf of the relatives of these unfortunate people, whether you would
consider the sum of two thousand reichsmarks adequate return for your personal
consideration, all other expenses having been arranged with the company."</p>
<p>The official once more bowed low. He also extended his hand.</p>
<p>"Herr Mildenhall," he promised, "the commission which you have placed in my
keeping shall be truly and faithfully carried out."</p>
<p>"Capital," Charles declared. "And here, in what we call in English the nick
of time, comes our friend Frederick with the slight <i>ap&eacute;ritif</i>
which we English and Americans usually permit ourselves at this hour of the
day. I hope that you will join us."</p>
<p>Frederick poured out the cocktails.</p>
<p>"A toast," Charles proposed, bowing towards Patricia and Blute. "To our safe
journey in the last train!"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-18" id="ch-18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<p>Charles, in accordance with the very sage advice of Marius Blute and his
temporary lady secretary, Patricia Grey, descended a short time later by the
crowded lift to take luncheon in the restaurant of the great, luxurious hotel.
He stopped short, however, on the threshold of the American Bar. If the
presence of the lady who was its sole occupant had anything to do with his
hesitation, he was too late. Already the Baroness was waving her hand. He
continued his progress into the room and raised her fingers to his lips.</p>
<p>"A divine chance!" he murmured.</p>
<p>"And you," she exclaimed, and those beautiful eyes were full of reproach,
"you are here in Vienna and we meet by accident!"</p>
<p>His moment of irresolution passed. There was not the slightest suggestion of
self-consciousness about her manner. It was plain that the result of their
little duel had ceased to rankle.</p>
<p>"Baroness," he replied, "an accident indeed, but I am running for my life.
Something tells me that it would not be healthy for an Englishman to be found
in Vienna to-morrow night."</p>
<p>"But you were here the night before last," she complained. "You took your
coffee with the Princess Sophie."</p>
<p>"It is true," he acknowledged. "She was gracious enough to send over a
message asking me to join her for a few minutes."</p>
<p>"So you remember the last time you met her?"</p>
<p>"I shall never forget it. You sat on my right hand. The Princess Sophie was
opposite. We were the guests of that delightful man&mdash;Leopold Benjamin. You
drove me home and, alas, you developed a very unfortunate curiosity about that
catalogue I was carrying away."</p>
<p>"You were very obstinate and very unkind," she said. "No wonder I had
completely forgotten you."</p>
<p>"We are quits, then," he remarked, "because that would have been an act of
even greater unkindness."</p>
<p>"There is no doubt whatever," she acknowledged, "that for an Englishman you
have a very glib tongue."</p>
<p>"I have also a very susceptible heart."</p>
<p>"Call it fancy."</p>
<p>"Fancy is a delightful word," he reflected, "and perhaps we do overtax that
other organ a little. Am I permitted to offer you a cocktail?"</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>Charles shivered as she selected a cherry brandy. He himself asked for a
small Martini.</p>
<p>"You do not approve of my taste in <i>ap&eacute;ritifs</i>?" she
queried.</p>
<p>"Nor in my sex," he replied. "That is to say if your luncheon companion is
to be the gentleman who looked in here and disappeared a moment ago."</p>
<p>"You mean Lieutenant von Hessen? He may not be a very agreeable person but
he is interesting."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"I mean it," she continued. "You probably do not know that he is in the
German Intelligence Department."</p>
<p>"I should never have believed that he was qualified for the post if you had
not told me so."</p>
<p>"Stupid!" she answered, smiling. "He only asked to be presented to me
because he had heard that I was an acquaintance of Leopold Benjamin's."</p>
<p>"Why on earth is everyone so interested in poor Benjamin?"</p>
<p>The Baroness yawned.</p>
<p>"Why do we talk of these foolish things after our long separation?" she
murmured.</p>
<p>"I am not so sure that they are foolish. My time in Vienna is short. I
arrived here late at night. In the morning the impulses of my civilized life
assailed me. I remembered that dinner and I started out to leave my card of
ceremony at the Palais Franz Josef."</p>
<p>"You found no one upon whom to leave it!"</p>
<p>"Neither man nor house," he replied. "I cannot say that I was surprised. If
the Germans really expected that Mr. Benjamin would sit there and wait to be
arrested they were very foolish. He must have known what would have been in
store for him. He probably had plenty of cars and planes and he took his leave.
Why are your German friends angry at that? Probably, if I were caught wandering
about the streets here in a couple of days, I should be placed in a
concentration camp. I should very much dislike to be placed in a concentration
camp. That's why I am hurrying home. Worse things, far worse things, might have
happened to Mr. Benjamin. He might have been dropped into a fortress and it is
just possible that he might never have been seen again. No, I don't think Mr.
Benjamin ought to be blamed for having hurried away."</p>
<p>She leaned nearer towards him, although the room was still empty except for
the barman.</p>
<p>"I think," she confided, "that it was not his flight so much that they
disapproved of. They rather expected that. It was what he took with him."</p>
<p>"Of course, I have heard no particulars about his leaving," Charles said
slowly. "It still seems to me a little crude to destroy a magnificent specimen
of historical architecture like the Palais Franz Josef. They would have done
better to confiscate it."</p>
<p>"I should think that they did it," she continued, still in the same
undertone, "in case by any chance there had been some secret spot in the
mansion where some of his treasures might have been hidden."</p>
<p>Charles did not attempt to conceal his expression of incredulity.</p>
<p>"Secret hiding-places of that sort do not exist nowadays," he said.
"Benjamin's house had been completely modernized and all traces of the old
portion had vanished. In their place it possessed shower baths, racket courts,
music rooms and all manner of luxuries. Baroness, alas, I fear I must take my
leave. For the second time your prospective host has looked in here. A Nazi
lieutenant in the German Army, even if he should only be in the Intelligence
Department, must not be kept waiting by a British civilian."</p>
<p>The Baroness played a false card.</p>
<p>"But you are not a British civilian," she rejoined. "You are a major in the
Dragoon Guards&mdash;one of the British crack regiments."</p>
<p>"And how did you know that?" he asked swiftly.</p>
<p>She looked up at him with a little pout. Underneath the caress of her eyes
he knew very well that she was annoyed with herself.</p>
<p>"I heard it somewhere. It must have been at the old Embassy. Perhaps you are
right about the Lieutenant, though. I have kept him waiting already a
quarter-of-an-hour. Shall I see you again?"</p>
<p>He shook his head dolefully.</p>
<p>"Alas, Baroness," he said as he held her fingers for a moment to his lips,
"I am compelled to say&mdash;I hope not. I am moving heaven and earth to get
away by the eight o'clock train to-morrow. If not I shall be in trouble."</p>
<p>"I will hide you," she whispered.</p>
<p>"You have heard before now what happens to the men of my country in the
world," he said sorrowfully, "when they hide under the skirts of the ladies of
their hearts after their country has declared war. But Baroness," he added,
after he had risen to his feet, "before we part there is one question I would
like to ask."</p>
<p>"I have no secrets from you."</p>
<p>"Why were you so anxious to secure possession of my present from Mr.
Benjamin, so anxious that you came back to my hotel and stole it?"</p>
<p>"I was piqued. Mr. Benjamin had promised me a copy of his marvellous
catalogue. He had one copy left and he chose to present it to a stranger. It
was not like Mr. Benjamin. It was an ungallant action."</p>
<p>He seemed dissatisfied.</p>
<p>"It seems an insufficient reason," he persisted. "What is the use of the
catalogue without the pictures?"</p>
<p>"The catalogue in itself is a work of art," she explained.</p>
<p>He remained apparently puzzled.</p>
<p>"To a person who was intending to dispose of the pictures," he reflected, "I
can quite understand that the catalogue might have been a priceless possession,
otherwise&mdash;"</p>
<p>She rose to her feet.</p>
<p>"I am spoiling you," she interrupted. "I stay here answering your questions
and my host again seeks me. I will confess, if it makes you happier, that mine
was a freakish and ill-conceived enterprise. I regret it. Banish your evil
thoughts of me, Charles. I must fly."<br>
<br></p>
<p>Charles crossed the hall, seated himself at a retired corner table in the
restaurant, ordered a bottle of Gumpoldskirchner and sent for the waiter. With
the help of a fragment of his roll he essayed and approved of the wine.</p>
<p>"<i>Ober Kellner</i>," he said to the man who came hurrying up, anxious to
serve personally a client who he knew held such a high place in the esteem of
the management, "it is necessary that I eat something."</p>
<p>"At this hour of the day, <i>mein Herr</i>," the man replied, "it is a habit
with many people to do so."</p>
<p>"You see this simple wine which I have chosen and which I like&mdash;what
shall I eat with it? I am reversing the usual custom of letting the wine blend
with the food. I am seeking for food which will bring out the flavour of this
unusual and very pleasant beverage."</p>
<p>The <i>ober Kellner</i> smiled. For a Britisher he found Charles
talkative.</p>
<p>"It should be something quite plain and of the English type, sir," he
suggested. "A grilled <i>entrec&ocirc;te</i> with my own sauce, potatoes
<i>souffl&eacute;</i> and beans of the country."</p>
<p>"It will be a hearty meal," Charles said a little doubtfully.</p>
<p>"It is as well sometimes to prepare for the day when meals will be less easy
to obtain," the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> pointed out. "To-morrow, for
instance, both restaurant cars have been removed from the Vienna-Innsbruck
Express. The train, already, one hears, is above the regulation length and
there are still hundreds of people clamouring for tickets."</p>
<p>"With the possibility of a day's starvation in front of me," Charles
remarked with a twinkle in his eyes, "I will accept the luncheon you have
offered. Afterwards I shall take a little mountain cheese and some fresh
fruit."</p>
<p>The <i>ober Kellner</i> disappeared with his order. Charles looked round
without seeing a single familiar face except that of the Princess Sophie, who
sat at her accustomed table. She caught his eye and beckoned him. He rose at
once and paid his <i>devoirs</i>.</p>
<p>"It will be also farewell, Princess. I leave tomorrow."</p>
<p>"You are one of those fortunate people who have obtained a seat on the last
train?"</p>
<p>"I believe so."</p>
<p>"You travel alone?"</p>
<p>"As there are over a thousand disappointed passengers I can scarcely hope
for that good fortune."</p>
<p>"I do not mean the companions of necessity," the Princess said. "I saw you
just now in the small cocktail bar with the Baroness von Ballinstrode. I have
not seen her since our dinner party at Leopold Benjamin's."</p>
<p>"She said nothing of leaving Vienna in her conversation with me this
morning."</p>
<p>The Princess looked thoughtful.</p>
<p>"It is not my affair," she continued, "but the Baroness was joined a few
moments after you left by one of those German Nazi officers who have been
thrust upon our city. Beatrice is always indiscreet. I have often reproved her
for it."</p>
<p>"She is a friend of yours, the Baroness?"</p>
<p>"My dear young man, she was a Von Bless, so how in Austria could one help
it? Her father was a friend of mine, her grandfather was a great gentleman and
our families have been connected for generations. Of Beatrice, who made an
indiscreet marriage from which I am told she has never wholly escaped, I am
bound to say that I have not a high opinion. I would not advise any young man
for whom I had any regard to accept her close friendship."</p>
<p>Charles was thoughtful for a moment.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Princess, why do you warn me about her?"</p>
<p>"Because, from a word she let fall as she passed me in the hall," she
confided, "I thought it possible that she might be on your train, and although
it is pure assumption on my part she left me with the idea that she had been
discussing your probable presence upon it with her companion."</p>
<p>He looked round the room.</p>
<p>"They don't seem to be lunching here," he observed.</p>
<p>"She and her friend, I am told, are more often to be met with at Driegel's,
which is a more intimate place than this. However, do not take what I have told
you too seriously," she added. "It was perhaps scarcely worth mentioning. It
did occur to me, though, that if you knew Beatrice as the daughter of a
distinguished family here, which she undoubtedly is, you might be inclined to
place more trust in her than she deserves. One might tolerate&mdash;in fact
many of us do&mdash;her great friendship with one of our own people, but I am
afraid that she has been indiscreet in other directions. I am a garrulous old
lady, am I not, Mr. Charles Mildenhall? Forget all that I have said. Remember
only the warning that lies underneath."</p>
<p>She gave him a little nod which he accepted as one of dismissal and returned
to his place. His light-heartedness of the morning had to some extent
disappeared. The more serious side of the adventure to which he was committed
was assuming a more definite place in his thoughts. He had just finished his
luncheon and ordered his coffee when a familiar figure entered the room, looked
round for a moment or two and then made his way to Charles's table. He was a
middle-aged man, grey-bearded and bespectacled, carefully dressed and of not
unpleasing presence. Charles had met him several times before, but their
acquaintance was only a slight one.</p>
<p>"Mr. Porter, isn't it?" Charles asked as they shook hands. "Sit down for a
moment. Perhaps you will join me in some coffee?"</p>
<p>The visitor handed his hat and cane to the page who had followed him in but
retained the despatch case which he was carrying.</p>
<p>"You are very kind. I will take some coffee certainly. Very trying times,
these, Mr. Mildenhall."</p>
<p>"They are indeed," Charles agreed, summoning his waiter. "What about a
cigar?"</p>
<p>"If I could have one of the light ones, native growth," he begged. "To tell
you the truth I haven't smoked for two days. His Excellency gave me so many
small things to finish up for him at the Embassy&mdash;semi-personal, of
course, some of them&mdash;that with those to look after and our own curious
position to consider I've been a trifle overtaxed lately."</p>
<p>"You still have a staff of some sort, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but half of them are Austrians," Mr. Porter explained, "and a great
many of them have been called up. However, I don't want to bother you with
outside affairs too much. I've just had a long despatch from Lascelles, brought
by plane from Munich. I have found all the papers he refers to and I have
brought them for your attention. I suggest that you read the note from Mr.
Lascelles, then you can give me a receipt for the papers and I can get back to
work. If it's true, as they tell me, that you are leaving to-morrow for
Switzerland, you will have all you can do to get through them."</p>
<p>The Consul leaned back in the chair, lit his cigar and sipped his coffee and
the glass of light but very pleasant liqueur brandy which Charles had ordered.
Every now and then he looked out into the street. He was a native of Hull, the
son of a well-to-do merchant captain, he had served in Rotterdam, Marseilles
and Vienna and he had made up his mind as he sat there that he had had enough
of it. Consular life in these days had become too strenuous. His pension was
due in a few months. A farmhouse in Northumberland, two hundred acres of
shooting and a seat on the Parish Council, perhaps, would be like a dream of
Paradise after this restless continental existence. He watched Charles
Mildenhall, a young man for whom he had a great respect, decode and read his
letter at the same time, with a pencil in his hand. Here was a young man who
was supposed to have a brilliant diplomatic future before him. Let him have it,
Mr. Porter decided. Not in his line at all...Charles paused to light another
cigarette and pushed the coffee towards his guest. Then he read through once
more the brief note from Lascelles.</p>
<blockquote>My dear Charles,<br>
<br>
I was on the way back to confer with you in Vienna and hand you some further
instructions to take up to Warsaw after you had visited our friend. They cabled
the news to me and ordered me home. There is not the slightest doubt that we
are in for it and the whole affair at first will be a horrible muddle, for
there Is nothing on God's earth we can do for the wretched Poles, and if our
friend's troops are anything Uke what I've seen entraining to-day for the
Polish frontier they will walk through any half-armed rabble, however brave
they may be.<br>
<br>
I expect poor old P. will be in an awful fuss. Don't let him worry you but the
contents of 17 A, B and C black despatch boxes in the main safe must be gone
through and destroyed. Please see to this yourself. Then, if you take my
advice, you will leg it for home as quickly as you can.<br>
<br>
F. L.<br>
<br>
P.S. If you have time, and for the love of her sweet little figure find time,
Charles, drop in at the hair-dressing rooms at the Bristol Hotel. Give
Mademoiselle Rosette a kiss and a thousand <i>schilling</i> note from
me.</blockquote>
<p>"Well, I'm damned!" Charles exclaimed with a sudden twinkle in his eyes.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon?"</p>
<p>"It was the postscript to my friend Lascelles' note. I suppose one must
expect one's friends to take a little advantage these times."</p>
<p>"We must certainly make allowances," the Consul admitted. "I always found
Mr. Lascelles exceedingly considerate the few times I came across him."</p>
<p>"I'm not complaining," Charles murmured.</p>
<p>"I am instructed," Mr. Porter said, finishing his coffee, "to hand you over
the keys of the black boxes. Here they are, Mr. Mildenhall. You will see the
numbers upon the labels."</p>
<p>"And the boxes?"</p>
<p>"They are in the charge of the great Joseph here," Mr. Porter declared.
"With your permission I will now take my departure."</p>
<p>Charles walked with his visitor out into the hall. Joseph came from his
bureau to meet them.</p>
<p>"If you are going up to your room, Mr. Mildenhall," he said, "I will send up
those three cases which the gentleman has left for you."</p>
<p>"Send them up as quickly as you can," Charles replied. "I am in the humour
for a little frivolous work. Don't send any strangers up, though. If the spies
of Vienna&mdash;they tell me that every other man is a spy here,
Joseph&mdash;knew what was in those black tin boxes they would blow me sky
high."</p>
<p>Mr. Porter, for the first time for many days, smiled slightly as he held out
his hand to Charles.</p>
<p>"Our young friend," he remarked to the <i>concierge</i>, "if I may venture
to call you so, Mr. Mildenhall, treats our sacred profession a little
lightly."</p>
<p>"Before I leave this city," Charles promised, "I will tell you what I think
of our profession!"</p>
<p>He bade his visitor farewell and walked with Joseph to the lift.</p>
<p>"You will find them very anxious to see you upstairs, sir," Joseph told him.
"We have had to make a few changes in the arrangements. All is well, though.
Everything has been carried out according to Mr. Blute's latest instructions.
The despatch cases are coming up in the lift with you, sir. I have kept them
within sight ever since they were handed over into my keeping."</p>
<p>Charles watched the cases placed inside, then he Spoke through the grille of
the lift gate to the <i>concierge</i>.</p>
<p>"Joseph, at what time will the manicure department for gentlemen close at
the Bristol Hotel this evening?"</p>
<p>"At about eight o'clock, sir," was the prompt reply.</p>
<p>"Telephone across, if you please, and speak to Mademoiselle Rosette. Tell
her not to leave the premises until an ambassador from Mr. Lascelles has
visited her this evening."</p>
<p>The man bowed without even the flicker of a smile.</p>
<p>"Your message will be delivered, sir," he promised.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-19" id="ch-19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<p>Charles Mildenhall's elegantly furnished salon had lost its character. It
had become a bureau of industry. Blute, in his shirt sleeves, was seated at a
writing-table with piles of accounts on one side and time-tables and maps on
the other. He was a very different person from the Marius Blute who had been
dragging wheezy music from a broken-down violin in the caf&eacute; des
Voyageurs not many hours ago. He helped Charles arrange the black tin boxes by
the side of the other writing-table and tipped the porter who brought them up.
He could scarcely restrain himself until he had bundled the fellow out of the
room. His manner still retained something of its phlegmatic calm but his speech
was cut and dried and unhesitating.</p>
<p>"Mr. Mildenhall," he announced, "we have been obliged to change some of our
plans. We have been very successful in everything so far but we must bend a
little where it is necessary."</p>
<p>"Proceed," Charles enjoined, throwing himself into an easy chair and casting
a discontented glance around the apartment. "First of all, though, where is
Miss Grey?"</p>
<p>"She has gone out to do a little shopping," Blute replied. "I showed her the
way out at the back and she will only be a few minutes. I don't want to leave
the place myself until I go down for the caskets. Miss Grey as Mr. Benjamin's
secretary and I as his agent might easily be recognized in the principal
streets, and I am just as anxious to avoid that as I am to avoid your being
seen with us."</p>
<p>"I expect you're right," Charles agreed. "Get along with it and make your
report now."</p>
<p>"This is what has happened," Blute continued. "The railway company, through
sheer necessity, have had to alter their plans. The last train for the frontier
leaves to-morrow morning and must run in two portions."</p>
<p>"The mischief!" Charles exclaimed. "That's rather a nuisance for us, isn't
it?"</p>
<p>"On the contrary," Blute assured him, "it is a great advantage. If the three
of us were to be seen on the platform, even if we were not absolutely together,
it might set people thinking."</p>
<p>"All right. You're in charge of the expedition, Blute."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mr. Mildenhall. The first train, or portion of the train, will
leave here at six o'clock in the morning, the second part at eight. I want to
persuade you, Mr. Mildenhall, to travel on the first portion."</p>
<p>"Six o'clock!" Charles groaned.</p>
<p>"It cannot be helped. The special van must be on the second portion,
therefore Miss Grey and myself, the coffins, the four men from the
undertaker's, who will sit with the coffins, and the three cases must leave at
eight o'clock."</p>
<p>"I can't see why we all can't go by the second portion if we occupy
different compartments," Charles suggested.</p>
<p>His companion hesitated.</p>
<p>"Mr. Mildenhall," he pointed out at last, "even if we are in separate
compartments, the fact that we arc travelling in the same train might easily be
noticed by anyone who was on the lookout. You must remember that I am not
altogether a stranger in this city. You only know me as Mr. Benjamin's agent,
but I have worked for others besides him in Vienna. If any man could be called
a professional spy I think I could fairly lay claim to that title."</p>
<p>"What company I am keeping!" Charles sighed.</p>
<p>"You needn't worry," Blute assured him. "My operations have been confined to
finance, politics have never interested me particularly. I have agents in every
capital of Europe worth mentioning. It was with their help that I was able to
arrange Mr. Benjamin's affairs so successfully and it is through them also that
I have been able to make all the preliminary arrangements for to-morrow's
expedition."</p>
<p>"Useful chap to know in a crisis, aren't you?" Charles observed. "All the
same, I was able to help you a little through Joseph."</p>
<p>"I most gratefully acknowledge it," Blute declared. "What I was anxious to
point out, however, was this. I have talked with every one of our expeditionary
force this afternoon and I have noticed the same thing with all of them. They
are looking forward to to-morrow's journey with a certain degree of
apprehension."</p>
<p>"What have they to worry about? We practically own the train until we get to
the frontier and as soon as we are over that we've nothing to fear from
anybody."</p>
<p>"I admire your confidence, and honestly I am inclined to share it, but that
feeling I have spoken of does exist amongst the others, although I cannot
understand why. Our friend, the guard, this morning I think looked upon this as
a gay adventure. This afternoon he is just as keen, just as confident of
carrying it through, even with these altered arrangements, but he is more
serious. Then those four men that I have engaged from the undertaker, who were
quite content with their little Viennese weapon, something like your English
jemmy, to start with, now each one of them decide that in case anything goes
wrong they would like to have a gun."</p>
<p>"I don't blame them for that," Charles declared. "A jemmy is not much use
except in a scrap and it's astonishing what a feeling of confidence a loaded
Colt gives you."</p>
<p>"I notice you don't carry a Colt yourself."</p>
<p>Charles shook his head.</p>
<p>"I like something smaller," he confided. "Revolver shooting is one of my few
accomplishments in life. If you know where to put the bullet, it doesn't need
to be very large. By the by, how is my chauffeur, Fritz? Feeling a little
better, I hope, than this morning. Were you able to make use of him?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Blute replied. "I took him round to the scene of last night's debauch
to clear things up. I can tell you it wasn't a pleasant sight, Mr. Mildenhall.
We dropped in at a caf&eacute; on our way back and had a double brandy quick.
Fritz had pretty well plastered his German friend."</p>
<p>"What did you do with his remains?"</p>
<p>"Don't ask me! It is not necessary, anyway, for you to know anything about
that. I can tell you this, though&mdash;unless something exceptional happens it
will be a good many years before anyone comes across them."</p>
<p>"How is the fellow at the hospital?"</p>
<p>"Safe to keep his Ups closed for a few days, I think," Blute said dryly.
"The only thing Fritz seems to be afraid of is that there might be a death-bed
confession. I looked at his chart, though, and I don't think he's as bad as
that. Faithful dog, that fellow Fritz. He can't think of anyone but his master.
He is terrified lest the Gestapo get on your track. Of course, I'm a little
anxious about that, too, but they've nothing really against you."</p>
<p>"Of course they haven't," Charles said impatiently. "Fritz is like a lot of
these Viennese. He is as impressionable and sensitive as he can be. I expect I
shall end by having to take him to England."</p>
<p>Patricia glided into the room. She sat on the arm of Charles's chair.</p>
<p>"Everything all right?" she asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"Of course," he smiled. "What is there to go wrong? Nothing&mdash;absolutely
nothing."</p>
<p>"Everything is O.K., so far," Blute reported a little less
enthusiastically.</p>
<p>"You've lost your colour," Charles told Patricia. "You're worrying, young
woman."</p>
<p>"I'm not."</p>
<p>"You've had no lunch, then."</p>
<p>"I have. I've had an omelette and a glass of red wine."</p>
<p>"Not enough."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that Miss Grey is taking this affair a little too seriously,"
Blute said, crossing the room towards them. "Just look at the matter for a
moment as I look at it, Mr. Mildenhall. If we go crash on this enterprise
what's the odds to those four men when they know that they're secure for life
if they bring it off, and probably only in for a short imprisonment if they
fail? The guard of the train&mdash;pretty well the same thing with him.
Joseph&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Joseph is impregnable, I admit," Charles declared. "If anyone laid a finger
upon Joseph I think there would be a minor revolution here. He'll be mayor of
the city before he's finished. He has more friends than any man I ever
knew."</p>
<p>"I quite agree," Blute assented. "I haven't a shadow of anxiety myself about
Joseph, Then there's myself. I stand to make a million if we succeed. It's the
end of work for me&mdash;the beginning of a life of leisure. If I
fail&mdash;well, Mr. Mildenhall, I'll only say this. I have had a nasty shock
these last few months&mdash;I will admit that&mdash;but it will never happen
again. Everything was against Miss Grey and myself in this wretched city. It
could never happen to us again to be censored out of existence."</p>
<p>"From what I've seen of you, Blute, I think you'd get out of anything in
time," Charles declared, "but there's Miss Grey here."</p>
<p>"She isn't really in it," Blute pointed out. "She and I were both employees
of Leopold Benjamin, but she has only the slightest association with the job I
am trying to work."</p>
<p>"Well, then we've no one to worry about."</p>
<p>"We have," the girl cried eagerly.</p>
<p>"Indeed we have," Blute agreed. "There is you, sir."</p>
<p>"Bosh!"</p>
<p>"What I'm afraid of," Blute explained, "is this. With the war coming on, if
there are any of these Gestapo about they'll try to drag you into it. Please
listen to me, Mr. Mildenhall," he went on as Charles showed signs of escaping.
"We should never have had a chance but for you. You found us the whole of the
money, we are going about now&mdash;at least I am&mdash;with our pockets
bursting. Think where you found us! We were down and out completely. I don't
say it would have lasted but when help came it would very likely have been too
late. You've helped with the plans here, you've been wonderful, sir. If I let
you get into trouble I don't think Mr. Benjamin, or this young lady here, for
that matter, would ever forgive me. I've been working to keep you out of it
this morning and you must please do all that I ask of you."</p>
<p>"You shall have your own way as long as it's reasonable," Charles assured
him. "I don't like that six o'clock train, though. I've heaps of things I want
to say to Miss Grey and I can't bear the thought of that long journey
alone."</p>
<p>"Never mind, sir," Blute insisted. "Remember this. There will be as many
spies about the Westbahnhof to-morrow as there will be passengers. As I have
arranged it everyone in the city will know that you left in a Diplomatic
<i>coup&eacute;</i> locked up by yourself two hours before the&mdash;what shall
I call it?&mdash;the conspiracy. Not one of us, not Miss Grey, not the caskets,
not the guard, not the railway agent, not I&mdash;will be on your train. If you
travel with us or even with Miss Grey you're in it up to the neck. Not one of
us counts. They tell me you've a great future before you, you're the nephew of
a peer of England and you belong to a great family who would be disgraced if
you were mixed up with this."</p>
<p>"That's all very well," Charles said discontentedly. "I have been working at
this thing with you practically the whole of the last two days. You're turning
me out of bed at five o'clock to-morrow morning, and then if any adventure
should come of it when we reach the frontier or thereabouts I'm to miss all the
fun."</p>
<p>Blute shook his head.</p>
<p>"It won't be fun, Mr. Mildenhall," he said. "I can assure you of that. I
don't believe for a single moment that anything can go wrong with our plans but
if it does," he added gravely, "it will be anything you like to call it, but it
won't be amusing!"</p>
<p>"All the more reason why I should be on the spot," Charles persisted
stubbornly.</p>
<p>Blute's tone and manner were alike changed. He spoke coldly but vigorously.
His frown was forbidding.</p>
<p>"Mr. Mildenhall," he said, "Miss Grey and I have talked this over and it's
come to this. We will let chance take care of what happens afterwards, but
unless you consent to go by the first train and go by yourself I shall give you
a cheque payable in London for the whole of the money you have advanced and we
shall ask you to retire."</p>
<p>Charles smoked nearly the whole of a cigarette and held Patricia's hand
firmly in his before he answered. Then he rose to his feet with a sigh, moved
to the other writing-table, lifted one of the tin boxes to his side and
unlocked it.</p>
<p>"All right," he decided, "have it your own way. All the same, I hate
travelling at six o'clock in the morning."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-20" id="ch-20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<p>"Never, young lady," Charles said an hour or so later, leaning back in his
chair and closing the lid of the last of the three boxes, "will you be able to
say in the days of our more-matured acquaintance that you have never seen your
husband do any real work."</p>
<p>Her eyes were flashing all sorts of things at him. She left her place, came
over and dragged a stool to his side.</p>
<p>"Do you want to be my husband?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Frantically."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Well, I suppose I must be fond of you. Isn't that a good reason?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but you can't be fond of me," she remonstrated. "You know nothing
about me. That first dinner&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Well, there's a proof," he interrupted. "At that one dinner, the first time
I had ever met you, do you remember what happened?"</p>
<p>The colour slowly crept into her cheeks. Very velvety and soft they looked
in the shaded lamplight by which she had been working.</p>
<p>"I can see you do," he went on. "I very nearly kissed you. Now I ask
you&mdash;isn't that a proof? Could any man want to kiss a girl whom he was
meeting for the first time in his life unless he had fallen head over ears in
love with her?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know," she said doubtfully. "They might in Vienna. I never
met with anything of the sort in New York. We mustn't talk nonsense, though. Is
there any more typing for me?"</p>
<p>"Not a thing," he answered. "You see," he continued, looking round at the
piles of torn paper by which he was surrounded, "I have a frantic sort of
weakness for destroying and tearing up papers. I never see an important
document lying about that I don't want to destroy it."</p>
<p>"A very inconvenient habit, I should think," Patricia laughed.</p>
<p>"It's a great strain. It means that if you don't have to learn them off by
heart you master their contents, at any rate."</p>
<p>"Do you mean to tell me that you have mastered the contents of all these
papers that you have destroyed?" she asked incredulously.</p>
<p>"Of course not. Only those that were worth while. You'll see a certain
number of documents still in sound condition. They are over on the right there.
You will see a smaller number on your left&mdash;also spared. Some of those
will be destroyed but both lots are to be glanced through again."</p>
<p>"What are they all about?"</p>
<p>"Well, the last one I destroyed," he told her, "was a bill for Her
Ladyship's lingerie from Madame Sturt. I destroyed the bill but I kept the
receipt."</p>
<p>"How much did the lingerie cost?"</p>
<p>He tweaked her ear&mdash;a soft pink and white shell-like little affair
which he abandoned with reluctance.</p>
<p>"Do you realize that I was once a member of that household? You must not
expect me to reveal the secrets of Her Ladyship's toilet. Most unbecoming."</p>
<p>"What are those serious-looking documents that you've kept?"</p>
<p>"Look here," he demanded, "are you a spy?"</p>
<p>"Why no," she assured him. "I should think it must be rather fun, though. If
by any chance you didn't change your mind and I did marry you, do you think you
could find me a little espionage work?"</p>
<p>"Nothing in it nowadays," he told her gloomily. "Typewriters and wireless
have done away with all that. Diplomacy as a fine art is finished."</p>
<p>"Then why are you taking all that trouble with those papers?"</p>
<p>"So that Her Ladyship shouldn't pay her lingerie bills twice."</p>
<p>"And to save her that," she said, "you can sit there for nearly three hours
with the fever of war in the air, troops marching by all the time and a long
perilous journey before us within a few hours?"</p>
<p>"It does seem a little off the map, doesn't it? But listen, I know what we
might do."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Slip down to the Herrenhof and have a cocktail. It's half-past seven."</p>
<p>"And supposing Mr. Blute comes back while we're there? You know perfectly
well that you have promised not to be seen anywhere on the other side of that
door with me."</p>
<p>"Quite right," he agreed. "Same thing. We'll have it up here. Telephone
down, there's a dear&mdash;ask especially for Frederick. Say we want White Lady
cocktails in a shaker&mdash;four of them."</p>
<p>She telephoned down the order, then she came back to his side.</p>
<p>"My temporary work is spoiling me for real work," she sighed. "I've been
with Mr. Benjamin for two years and he has never offered me a cocktail."</p>
<p>"Quite right. You couldn't have been out of your teens two years ago and
cocktail drinking is not a child's habit."</p>
<p>"My teens, as you call them," she confided, "were finished long before I
went to Mr. Benjamin's bank. It is time you began to treat me with a little
more respect."</p>
<p>"We don't have time to play games," he told her. "Every time I've met you
we've been facing a crisis."</p>
<p>"It is quite true," she admitted. "I wish we could get you to take this one
a little more seriously."</p>
<p>"It is difficult to take anything seriously in Vienna," he said. "To tell
you the truth, the ways of even our diplomats here are strange. In this medley
which I have been requested to clean up and leave nothing behind me are some
quite important notes concerning a conversation between two important people.
The same rubber band enclosed the account for Her Ladyship's lingerie."</p>
<p>"Very slack," she criticized.</p>
<p>"Don't be too severe," he begged. "These are just the scraps left over from
about a ton of rubbish which bothered our very respectable Consul, Mr. Porter.
Kindly collect for me, dear secretary-in-chief and wife-that-is-to-be, every
wastepaper basket you can find in the apartment. I can count three from
here."</p>
<p>"Aren't you rather harping on that matrimonial business?" she asked as she
started on her tour round the room.</p>
<p>"It drives everything else out of my mind," he confided. "Especially when
you look as sweet as you do this evening."</p>
<p>She paused in the centre of the apartment with a basket in either hand.</p>
<p>"Come and kiss me," he insisted.</p>
<p>She moved slowly towards him without any marked reluctance.</p>
<p>"Tell me," she enquired, "have you ever had a secretary before?"</p>
<p>"Heaps of them."</p>
<p>"Did you expect them to come and kiss you whenever you felt amorous?"</p>
<p>"I never felt that way."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"They were all men."</p>
<p>"Do you mean that you never had a girl secretary?"</p>
<p>"Never in my life," he assured her. "When I've been staying down at home
I've sometimes dictated a few letters to my mother's amanuensis but as she is
well over fifty, wears most unbecoming glasses and has taken a degree at Oxford
I refrained from taking liberties."</p>
<p>She brought the baskets and succeeded in slipping from his knee just as the
waiter arrived with the cocktails.</p>
<p>"Never," Patricia confessed, opening her vanity-bag, "have I been driven to
my mirror so often as I have been during the last few hours."</p>
<p>"Well, there's a slight difference between the atmosphere of New York and
Vienna, isn't there?" he remarked. "Waiter," he added, "you can leave the
shaker and come back again in half-an-hour."</p>
<p>Two more wastepaper baskets were discovered and filled. Charles leaned back
in his chair and lit a cigarette.</p>
<p>"Is it my fancy," he asked, "or has my charming helper and bride-to-be been
afflicted with a sudden seriousness?"</p>
<p>"I have been wondering," she confided, "where we shall find Mr.
Benjamin."</p>
<p>"I can't think how you ever completely lost him," Charles reflected. "I
should have thought Blute would have had a special emergency address which
would have reached him."</p>
<p>"He had several&mdash;and pseudonyms, too. He had tried them all before we
got into the state in which you found us. The censorship here is simply
devastating. Practically everything in any sort of code was destroyed."</p>
<p>"It's a mistake," he told her, "to attempt to get a code letter through a
censor anywhere. But let's abandon this discussion now and talk about something
really interesting."</p>
<p>"Suggest something, then."</p>
<p>"Getting married."</p>
<p>"Lovely! Go on, please."</p>
<p>"You see, I'm slightly interested in what happens the other side of that
frontier, but when we find ourselves in the bracing climate of Switzerland I
can't carry a private chaplain in my waistcoat pocket and I believe it's a
terribly complicated thing, anyway, to get married in Switzerland."</p>
<p>"Let's talk about it," she insisted. "It's a heavenly thing to talk about,
anyway."</p>
<p>The floor valet knocked at the door and interposed.</p>
<p>"Shall you be changing to-night, sir?" he enquired.</p>
<p>Charles hesitated.</p>
<p>"Remember," she told him, "Mr. Blute was terribly anxious that you should do
everything according to your usual custom. He can't somehow get it out of his
head that we're being watched."</p>
<p>"Dear old boy, he's probably right," Charles acknowledged. "All right,
Franz, I'll be round in two minutes. Will you order your dinner yourself,
child?" he asked. "The waiter will be here directly."</p>
<p>She shook her head firmly.</p>
<p>"For me to dine up here is forbidden, too. Mr. Blute has been very firm
about it. I suppose it is quite easy if anyone is watching these apartments for
them to find out whether any extra meals are served up here."</p>
<p>"What about my ordering dinner for one, but plenty of it? We can eat off the
same plate and fool them that way."</p>
<p>"You're ridiculous," she laughed. "Mr. Blute showed me a very clean little
restaurant out at the back part of the hotel where some of the <i>courriers</i>
and hotel clerks go sometimes. I can use the service stairs to it and I'll
hurry back for coffee."</p>
<p>Charles took her into his arms for a moment before she slipped off. Then he
held her about a yard away and looked into her face.</p>
<p>"It's the deep setting of your eyes, child, which has so completely
disturbed my affections. Rather theatric, you know, but it's frightfully
attractive."</p>
<p>"Don't dare to look into any others," she enjoined, releasing herself
reluctantly. "Especially beware of the beautiful Baroness!"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-21" id="ch-21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<p>The Baroness was there all right. She was seated on a divan in Frederick's
small private bar and by her side was the young German officer. She waved her
hand to Charles and patted the place by her side.</p>
<p>"Come, Mr. Mildenhall," she invited. "This is somewhat piquant. Come and
amuse a tired woman. Come and have a glass of wine with us. To-morrow it will
not be possible."</p>
<p>Charles bowed to both of them and accepted the invitation.</p>
<p>"To-morrow," she went on, "if that brave little island of yours makes up its
mind to stand up and fight the mighty German Empire, if you two should meet one
of you will be interned. Is that not so, Count?"</p>
<p>"I have no idea," the young man replied formally, "as to what Herr
Mildenhall's exact diplomatic position is. If he claims no privileges he will
certainly have to be dealt with as an enemy."</p>
<p>"I have at present no diplomatic position," Charles admitted, "which is the
reason why I am running away. I am taking the last train to the frontier. If
you will excuse me," he added, waving on one side the bottle of champagne, "I
will ask Frederick to mix me one of his White Lady cocktails."</p>
<p>"You will not, I fear," the young officer observed, "have a comfortable
journey."</p>
<p>"I am a seasoned traveller," was the careless reply. "I am used to
hardships."</p>
<p>The Baroness shivered.</p>
<p>"Hardships," she echoed. "I hate even the sound of the word. I like
comfort."</p>
<p>There was a single moment in their lives when Lieutenant Count von Hessen
and Charles Mildenhall were <i>en rapport</i>. They both glanced involuntarily
at the Baroness, who gave one the impression of a gorgeous butterfly stretched
out on the divan in the gentle and voluptuous abandon of her soulless, insect
life. The beauty of her limbs if anything was a little too much displayed under
the light chiffon of her gown. Her neck and shoulders were exquisite. As a
matter of fact she was looking her best that night. There was a twin gleam of
humour in the eyes of the two men as they met for a moment.</p>
<p>"The Baroness glorifies that simple word," Charles murmured.</p>
<p>"My friend speaks truthfully," the German assented.</p>
<p>"A girl friend of mine once declared," the Baroness said with a faintly
humorous smile upon her lips, "that I was not nearly so beautiful as I believed
but that I had the gift, when I desired to use it, of appearing beautiful. It
has not brought me much reward in this world. If it gives anyone pleasure to
look at me I am glad. But how do I benefit by it? Not at all. I am an unhappy
woman."</p>
<p>"Unhappiness could never remain in so lovely a setting," the Count
pronounced with stilted emphasis.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, it is true," she assured them. "I am unhappily married. My
husband does not come near me. I have a dear friend who is always in political
troubles and who flies from country to country. I have a few acquaintances who
please me&mdash;like you two. But you amuse yourselves and you hurry away.
That, Mr. Mildenhall&mdash;and you. Count, is not the way to treat a woman whom
you profess to find attractive."</p>
<p>"I am the slave of duty," the Count volunteered.</p>
<p>"I am a wanderer who has lingered too long in Paradise," Charles sighed.
"Now I have to fly or the stern hand of the law will set me down in a draughty
tent somewhere behind barbed wire!"</p>
<p>"I am obviously unlucky in my admirers!" she lamented.</p>
<p>Charles sipped his cocktail. Somehow it seemed to lack the flavour of its
predecessor.</p>
<p>"I have not received even an invitation to dine," the Baroness went on.</p>
<p>The Lieutenant Count von Hessen rose smartly to his feet. He stood to
attention.</p>
<p>"Baroness," he said, "you are aware of the necessity of my presence at the
Barracks at half-past nine to-night. If you will share a humble meal with me
now it will give me great pleasure and will render less sad my departure."</p>
<p>The Baroness showed signs of being disposed to linger.</p>
<p>"Will you order the dinner, dear friend?" she suggested, smiling up at him.
"When it is ready I will come. There is wine to finish and the days of economy
must begin once more."</p>
<p>"The dinner is already ordered," he said firmly. "I ventured to anticipate a
favourable reply to my invitation. It is the duty of a soldier always to be
economical. Frederick, will you send the bottle of wine to my table?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, Herr Lieutenant," the man replied. "It shall be done."</p>
<p>The Baroness, a little wearily, held out her hand to Charles, who had also
risen, and rose gracefully but languidly to her feet.</p>
<p>"It is to be farewell, then, Mr. Charles Mildenhall?"</p>
<p>"Baroness," he said as he bent over her fingers, "after all, there is a
chance the war may not come. In that case we shall meet before long in one of
the three capital cities of pleasure."</p>
<p>"And they are?"</p>
<p>"Vienna, Paris or London&mdash;perhaps even in New York."</p>
<p>The Count and Charles exchanged formal bows. The Baroness threw Charles a
kiss from the tips of her fingers. She was a woman who knew how to express a
great deal in a pout. She exercised her art as she left the room with that
frankly voluptuous swing of the hips which had cost many a man his night of
dreamless repose.<br>
<br></p>
<p>The very luxurious little saloon which the gilded youth of Vienna were
accustomed to frequent for the purpose of having their nails manicured was
almost empty when Charles presented himself. A lady in a gorgeous coiffure, who
was seated at a table near the entrance, flashed a dazzling smile at him and
indicated the line of shrouded chairs beyond. A young woman, becomingly attired
in a black silk frock of Viennese design, motioned him into a small apartment
which she had just left. She spoke in French.</p>
<p>"You are a little late. Monsieur Mildenhall."</p>
<p>"It is unfortunately true," he apologized. "Everyone, I think, is
half-an-hour late in Vienna to-day. They are all getting ready to leave
to-morrow. Nevertheless, I apologize."</p>
<p>"I have waited for you," she said simply. "You are a friend of Monsieur
Lascelles?"</p>
<p>"Quite true. I have to bring you two farewell offerings. This one," he
added, handing her the thousand <i>schilling</i> note in an envelope, "and
this," raising her fingers to his lips.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Lascelles was more generous with his money than with his little
caress," she remarked.</p>
<p>"It is the only fault the genuine Englishman possesses," he assured her. "We
are a jealous race. My friend, I can tell you, left the city with much
reluctance."</p>
<p>"They told me before I came that everyone was always happy in Vienna," she
sighed. "I did not find it so in London, nor even in Paris. Here I do not think
it will remain so. One feels the change coming."</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle," he agreed, "you are entirely right. If I were you I would at
once return to Paris. The joys of Vienna are passing. Soon they will become
history."</p>
<p>She looked at him disconsolately.</p>
<p>"But you are depressing! Monsieur Lascelles, he told me that however
seriously you really felt you had the gift of appearing light-hearted, that you
made the world always seem a carefree place. He said that part of your success
in your profession was that you seemed always to be a trifler, even when you
were dealing with serious things."</p>
<p>"Well, do you disapprove?" he asked. "One should not ask the world to share
one's sorrows."</p>
<p>She glanced through the curtains to where her employer had been seated. Her
chair was vacant. The lights of the place were burning dimly. She drew back the
curtain and returned to the side of the client's chair where Charles was
seated. She slipped a little bowl of hot water into the ring for its
reception.</p>
<p>"You are already tired, Mademoiselle," he remarked.</p>
<p>"I am not proposing," she said, "to attend to your nails. This is what they
call in English a bluff. It is in case a chance client should present himself,
although it is after hours. Did you know, Mr. Mildenhall, that your friend left
a message with me for you?</p>
<p>"Not an idea," he answered. "He said nothing about it."</p>
<p>"That is rather like him. You were not formally attached to the Embassy,
were you?"</p>
<p>"Not now," he told her. "I am a free lance. I call in there whenever I am in
Austria for old association's sake."</p>
<p>"Just so. Monsieur Lascelles had a fixed post there, had he not?"</p>
<p>"Certainly. He was First Secretary. Do you know, Mademoiselle," Charles went
on, "I dare say Monsieur Lascelles told you that I had queer habits and ideas.
One of my ideas is that I do not like very much to talk about politics or what
goes on at the Embassy, even though I have now no responsibilities."</p>
<p>"I expected that speech," she said smiling. "I am very much to be trusted,
though, Monsieur Mildenhall. I might tell you something which would surprise
you quite a great deal, but it is not necessary. You received from your friend.
Monsieur Lascelles, to-day three black boxes with a request that you go through
them and destroy everything that was worthless and preserve for your own
transportation to London what you thought should be kept."</p>
<p>Mildenhall's stern grey eyes were fixed upon the girl. The smile had gone
from his lips. She felt the difference at once. It was like a little draught of
icy wind passing through the overperfumed atmosphere. He made no answer to her
statement nor did he comment upon it. He simply waited.</p>
<p>"I tell myself," she went on softly, "that tomorrow morning Monsieur
Mildenhall will be leaving Vienna. It must be that he will come and see me
to-night. I get your message. I wait."</p>
<p>There was another pause. Charles knocked the ash from the cigarette that he
had been smoking. It was his only movement. His face remained
expressionless.</p>
<p>"In one of the three boxes," she continued, "you found a sealed letter which
you have without doubt preserved. The letter was contained in a long brown
envelope sealed with green wax and addressed to Monsieur Lascelles at the
Embassy."</p>
<p>She paused.</p>
<p>"You will forgive me if I light another cigarette," Charles observed. "The
atmosphere of this place is a little overpowering."</p>
<p>She accepted one from his case, struck a match and offered it to him.</p>
<p>"Well," he said, "Mademoiselle Rosette, your little story about the three
boxes is absolutely correct. Now what about this message?"</p>
<p>"The envelope addressed to Monsieur Lascelles," she demanded breathlessly,
"the brown envelope with the green seals&mdash;you have preserved that?"</p>
<p>There was again that uncompromising and brutal silence. She failed to
penetrate it by gesture, the eloquence of her pleading eyes, the touch of her
fingers. He remained stony and immutable.</p>
<p>"The message is simply this," she went on. "I was to say that he had changed
his mind with regard to the contents of that letter and that you were to hand
it over to me just as it was. Monsieur Lascelles told me to say that the proof
of my good faith would be the fact that I knew of its existence."</p>
<p>For several moments Charles seemed absorbed in thought. Nevertheless, the
girl, who was watching him closely, was conscious of a change. The quality of
his silence was altered. Her fear of him was slowly passing. After all, he was
human. He leaned over and felt her hand. She returned the pressure of his
fingers eagerly. He felt her cheek. She crept nearer to him.</p>
<p>"Your fingers are icy cold!" he exclaimed. "So is your cheek! Yet the
temperature of this place is almost overpowering. Mademoiselle Rosette, you are
not well, I fear."</p>
<p>"I am perfectly well," she assured him. "For a moment or two you frightened
me. Indeed&mdash;indeed, Mr. Mildenhall, it was that which did upset me very
much. I had the idea that I was talking to a lay figure, to someone who
listened only with his ears but not with his brain."</p>
<p>"Very clever," he smiled. "Well, I don't seem to remember coming across a
brown envelope with green seals. I must go through the boxes again."</p>
<p>"But you have been through them once and you cannot have missed a letter
like that!"</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>"You have no idea how careless I am," he confided. "Lascelles did not seem
to attribute very much importance to the affair. I think I shall go through
them after dinner."</p>
<p>She gazed at him as though doubting the sound of his words.</p>
<p>"But you have been through the boxes!" she gasped.</p>
<p>"How do you know that?" he asked quickly.</p>
<p>She was breathing fast now. All her fears seemed to be returning. That
delicately shaped bosom was rising and falling quickly. She pressed closer to
him. He held out his hand.</p>
<p>"I shall go through them more carefully after dinner," he told her, patting
her gently but at the same time rising to his feet.</p>
<p>"Ah, but you must not go away like this," she begged. "Let me go with you to
your room. If I feel cold, if I seem ill, it is because I am hungry. I am
worried, too. I do not understand&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What is it that you do not understand?" he asked calmly.</p>
<p>"You are strange with me, you act as though you did not believe."</p>
<p>He was infinitely remote again. He had picked up his hat. He was
leaving&mdash;leaving her in this terrible state of uncertainty. She clung to
his arm as he moved towards the door.</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle Rosette," he said, smiling down at her, "you are certainly
very attractive. Let me give you a word of advice. One profession should be
enough for you. Stick to the manicuring."<br>
<br></p>
<p>Charles, still dinnerless, returned nevertheless to his rooms. He found the
valet in his bedchamber talking eagerly to Patricia. The latter welcomed him
with immense relief.</p>
<p>"Charles," she cried, "Franz has just been across to fetch me. He declares
that someone has been in your room."</p>
<p>"How do you know that, Franz?" Charles asked.</p>
<p>"These three tin boxes, sir," the man replied, pointing to them. "I brought
them out, as you instructed me, empty from the salon. I put them together in
that corner of the room. I came in here after you had descended and I found
that the boxes had been moved."</p>
<p>"They were empty," Charles pointed out.</p>
<p>"Empty or not," the valet continued, still shaking, "someone has been in the
room with a master key. A bureau drawer was open."</p>
<p>"Well, well," Charles said smiling, "it might have been worse. There is not
a thing of value or importance in this room. Calm yourself, my dear fellow. If
you will feel easier for knowing it there was a letter once in number two of
these tin boxes. The letter itself is in ashes, its contents are here," he
concluded, tapping his forehead.</p>
<p>The valet breathed a sigh of relief. Charles and Patricia walked arm in arm
through into the salon.</p>
<p>"There is just one point about this," Charles observed. "I have now more
confidence than ever in Mr. Blute. This affair is not of vast importance but it
supplies a test. Blute is quite right. We have spies all round us. Run along
and finish your dinner. I shall be up in half-an-hour, unless someone drops
some strychnine into my coffee."</p>
<p>"Don't run the risk," she begged. "I'll make the coffee myself up
here&mdash;and tell the waiter&mdash;coffee for one but bring enough for
two."</p>
<p>"It's an idea," he assented.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-22" id="ch-22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<p>"Baroness!" Charles exclaimed, waking apparently from a profound slumber,
sleepily stifling a yawn, sitting up in his corner seat and staring in
well-simulated amazement at his neighbour. "What the mischief are you doing in
this train and how on earth did you find your way into my
<i>coup&eacute;</i>?"</p>
<p>The Baroness' exclamation was without a doubt sincere. A few seconds before,
Charles had appeared to be in the deepest of slumbers. She withdrew her eyes
from the tin despatch box in the rack opposite and stared at him.</p>
<p>"How long have you been awake?" she asked.</p>
<p>"That is no answer to my question," he reminded her. "What are you doing in
this train and how does it happen that we have become neighbours?"</p>
<p>"You are not pleased to find me here?"</p>
<p>His eyes still seemed full of sleep. He yawned once more. He tapped the
label gummed on the window of the compartment.</p>
<p>"How did you find your way in here. Baroness?"</p>
<p>"Baroness!" she complained. "I like better Beatrice."</p>
<p>"I wish that you would answer my question."</p>
<p>"My dear, what would you have?" she protested. "Last night I got into
serious trouble. It was because my thoughts were with you. I could not help it.
He wearied me&mdash;that young German Nazi. He wanted me to stay with him until
the hour of his departure. I refused. He left me white with fury."</p>
<p>"It sounds as though you had been very unkind to the young man, but I
scarcely see how that explains your presence here," he said patiently.</p>
<p>"Am I doing any harm?" she asked. "The Herr Lieutenant lodged a complaint
about me with the police. The under-chief of the police is a friend of mine. He
sent me a word of warning. He advised me to get away from Vienna without delay.
I pack a few things and I come. I arrive at the station. It is a seething mass
of human beings. The station master, the officials, they were all in
despair&mdash;but what could they do? 'Only let me get on the train,' I begged.
That is what happened. They put me in the corridor and they lifted my
dressing-case and bag after me. I sit on my bag very unhappy. Then I walk a
little way and what do I see? It is the one man of whom I have been thinking,
the one man for whose sake I am in trouble. I was brave. An inspector passed. I
pointed to the empty seats in your <i>coup&eacute;</i>. I said, 'Monsieur has
locked the door by accident. I wish to enter.' He read the label and hesitated.
I empty my purse into his hand and he opens the door. That is how I come
here."</p>
<p>"Do not think," Charles begged, sitting still a little more upright, "that I
complain of my good fortune, but you will admit that when I woke up it was a
shock to see you there."</p>
<p>"I have explained," she pointed out. "You have a good word for it in
English. It is a coincidence. Believe me, I did not intrude upon you willingly.
I do not look my best at this hour of the morning. I need a great deal of sleep
always and I have had very little."</p>
<p>"But where are you going to?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I have yet to make my plans. Paris, I think. Believe me, though, I shall be
no encumbrance to you. I have money, I have a passport, I have a ticket as far
as Z&uuml;rich. I think I shall go to Paris. Why do you ask? You are not really
interested."</p>
<p>"I can assure you that I am."</p>
<p>"It is not interest of the sort I desire. It is curiosity. It is perhaps
suspicion. Why should you feel like that towards me, Charles?"</p>
<p>"There was that little affair of Mr. Benjamin's catalogue, you know," he
reflected. "Then the number and variety of your admirers keeps me disquieted.
By the by, where is His Highness?"</p>
<p>"Your namesake?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"From Z&uuml;rich I telephone," she confided. "It is possible that he is at
Monte Carlo. Monte Carlo would suit me very well for a short time unless
something more amusing suggested itself. What are your plans, Charles?"</p>
<p>"Already," he told her severely, "you have begun to interfere with them.
That box is full of papers, most of which need destroying. I ought to begin
work on them at once."</p>
<p>Her eyes, he decided, were beautiful even at this time in the morning,
although they rather resembled a cat's. They were watching him sleepily yet
intently.</p>
<p>"I do not wish to interfere with your work," she said. "I will help
you."</p>
<p>"I am not yet sufficiently awake," he confessed. "Perhaps I will doze a
little longer."</p>
<p>"But you are ungallant," she complained. "I know what I will do. I have a
thermos full of coffee here. I will give you a cup. Then you will wake up. You
will be your old self. How is that? What do you say?"</p>
<p>She drew her dressing-case a little closer to her and unlocked it. She
brought out a very beautiful thermos and two collapsible cups. She filled them
with coffee and held one out towards him. He shook his head.</p>
<p>"You will excuse me," he begged, glancing at his watch. "I had coffee at the
hotel. Before long I shall shock you by bringing out a little apparatus of my
own which makes something more palatable."</p>
<p>"You will not take a half a cup?" she pleaded. "It is of my own making."</p>
<p>He shook his head again.</p>
<p>"Don't let me stop you, though."</p>
<p>She poured the contents of the cups carefully back into the thermos.</p>
<p>"I will wait," she murmured.</p>
<p>"If you wait for me to drink that coffee," he said gently, "you will wait a
long time."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Only that I do not drink coffee in the middle of the morning," he replied.
"Do not let us bandy words any longer, Baroness&mdash;or Beatrice&mdash;which
you like. I must think and I must think very hard."</p>
<p>"What about?"</p>
<p>"I must try to solve the question which is at present puzzling me. I must
try to find out why you have chosen to board this train and why I opened my
eyes to find you staring at that tin box."</p>
<p>"All these things you could find out quickly," she assured him, "if you
would give me your own confidence."</p>
<p>"And in return?"</p>
<p>"What do you want?" she asked. "Not me, I am afraid. Never have I gone so
near offering myself to anyone as I have to you. All the time you keep me at a
distance. At night I begin to look for the crow's-feet round my eyes. I look at
my body before the glass. I ask myself what you can find fault with. Sometimes
I fancy that your voice grows a little kinder. The moment passes and the
suspicions are all back again, the cold light is fixed in your eyes. And I
could do so much for you!"</p>
<p>He threw down the window and looked out. They were passing across a great
stretch of upland country and a fresh tingling wind from the distant mountains
was blowing in their faces. He moved to the other side of the carriage and
glanced down the corridor. The train seemed packed with a monumental burden of
human beings, men and women from every walk of life, from a little herd of
terrified Jews to the scattered members of a British touring company. The heat
was overpowering. People were wedged together in the corridors until there was
scarcely room for them to breathe. The air which swept through the window
brought fresh life with it. The smell of the fields and woods seemed to chase
away the heavy odours of the overcrowded train. Charles turned and dabbled his
fingers in the tiny toilet basin and passed them over his eyes. He took Eau de
Cologne from his dressing-case and offered it to his companion. She moistened
her hands and lips.</p>
<p>"My bath this morning was a farce," he remarked. "It was five o'clock and
the water was unheated. A swim in some southern sea, and a sun bath afterwards,
I think that is what we need."</p>
<p>"We could have it," she murmured.</p>
<p>"Ah, my dear, but there is work to be done," he reminded her. "There is work
before me now."</p>
<p>"Where do you sleep to-night?"</p>
<p>"How can I tell." he answered. "Somewhere in Switzerland, I hope."</p>
<p>"There is always a doubt," she said, "whether we shall cross the frontier
to-night. There is another huge train behind ours. I cannot really see how
everyone can expect to get through the Customs. Is this all your luggage?" she
concluded, looking round the <i>coup&eacute;</i>,</p>
<p>"I have clothes in Switzerland."</p>
<p>"Clothes and what?"</p>
<p>"It is the curse of my life," he sighed, "that I can never answer a
beautiful woman in the way she sometimes deserves. I ought to tell you firmly
and unmistakably not to seek to penetrate into my secrets and instead of that I
find myself telling you very gently that much though I appreciate your interest
in my affairs I should prefer your abandoning this habit of perpetually teasing
me with questions."</p>
<p>"You are a tantalizing person, Charles."</p>
<p>"You will like me better presently when I tell you something."</p>
<p>She moved a little closer to him.</p>
<p>"What is it, please?"</p>
<p>"I possess a luncheon basket."</p>
<p>Disappointment gleamed for a moment in her eyes.</p>
<p>"You are so very British," she said. "I, too, love to eat and I shall
certainly be hungry by and by but there are other things I like better."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"I love kindness and kind words. I am a soft woman. I love affection. I love
love. I really do not think you understand what Austrian women are like,
Charles."</p>
<p>He was silent for several moments. When he spoke again she might well have
believed that she had made progress.</p>
<p>"It is a pity," he complained, "that women, so lovable in themselves, should
devote their lives as they so often do to unworthy purposes. I can imagine you,
Beatrice, as a wonderful wife, a delightful companion, an excellent mother. The
trouble seems to be that nowadays a woman does not find these things
sufficient. She peers into the men's world of strife and struggle and she
fosters unsuitable ambitions. The Viennese world, the little I have seen of it,
is inclined to be artificial, Beatrice. The realities arc not sufficient. From
the manicurist to the Princess, all women seem to be searching for something in
life which they will never find."</p>
<p>"What we do, we do for men's sake," she said bitterly. "It is to help or to
bring us nearer to some man whom we love or think that we love."</p>
<p>He rose to his feet.</p>
<p>"This," he declared, "is an absurd conversation. If I can find my way so far
I am going to make a little promenade."</p>
<p>"And leave me alone with all your property?" she asked, pointing with a
sudden smile to the tin box.</p>
<p>"I shall leave you alone even with that. Baroness. Perhaps the very fact
that I do so will dispel some of those suspicions you have of me. If I should
happen to come across the crushed and suffocated remains of our conductor
amongst this phalanx of people, is there any information you would like to
have?"</p>
<p>"I should like to know at what hour we arrive at this little town near
Feldkirch where we are to wait for the other train to join us, and whether we
are supposed to leave the train for the night or remain in it."</p>
<p>"I'll do my best to find out," he promised, "but it's a thin chance, from
what I can see."</p>
<p>He paused to light a cigarette and stepped out into the corridor. It took
him more than a quarter-of-an-hour to reach the conductor, who was obstinately
protecting his stool in the far corner of the <i>voiture</i>. The corridor was
jammed. Not a single window was open. One other <i>coup&eacute;</i>, the same
size as his own, was occupied by at least a dozen English and American
tourists. In every other compartment the people seemed to have wedged their way
in indiscriminately. Some were sitting upon the floor outside in the corridor
itself. It was necessary at times to step over crowds of prostrate men and
women, some of them still asleep. Charles reached the conductor at last. The
man rose and saluted him as he approached but he kept his foot upon the
stool.</p>
<p>"I have here," he announced, "a note for the <i>gn&atilde;diger Herr</i>. If
I had tried to deliver it before I should never have been able to return."</p>
<p>He felt in his satchel and produced the note. It was written in Blute's
clear handwriting and addressed to him by name.</p>
<blockquote>Your train will remain outside the station of Feldkirch at a small
country village until ours arrives. A room is engaged for you at the only
hotel&mdash;the Schweizerhof. Be sure to claim it directly you arrive. The
journey will be continued at nine o'clock tomorrow morning. All well.<br>
<br>
M. B.</blockquote>
<p>Charles handed the eagerly anticipated <i>trinkgeld</i> to the man who took
off his cap and broke into a smile which sat strangely upon his wrinkled and
perspiring countenance.</p>
<p>"We shall arrive at about what time?" Charles enquired.</p>
<p>The man's gestures were indicative of a profound ignorance.</p>
<p>"To-night&mdash;to-morrow night. Who can tell? We are taking the place of
the great express which touches in these parts a hundred kilometres an hour. We
proceed at less than thirty. Nevertheless, we make no stops. That much is to
the good. I would offer my services to the <i>gn&atilde;diger Herr</i> but I am
helpless. There is nothing I can do. If by chance the guard should bring the
train to a standstill I will offer myself to seek anything the
<i>gn&atilde;diger Herr</i> might wish for."</p>
<p>"I have some food with me," Charles told him. "If you have any drinkable
water you can bring it along. There is nothing else I want seriously."</p>
<p>Charles started on his return journey and decided that he had no curiosity
left in his fellow passengers. He tore the note which he had received into
small pieces and let them slip through his fingers as he passed the only opened
window. The Baroness looked up expectantly as he entered the
<i>coup&eacute;</i>. He went straight to his dressing-case, drew out a cocktail
shaker wrapped in a towel, shook it violently, handed a glass to his companion,
brought one out for himself, filled the two and replaced the shaker. He
swallowed half his cocktail at a gulp.</p>
<p>"The place," he declared, "is a madhouse. Men and women of every race,
squawking babies; the women&mdash;half of them asleep&mdash;are lying about
anywhere, the men angry and sullen. I don't think I like these wild
rushes."</p>
<p>He lit a cigarette which she had placed between her lips, lit another for
himself, refilled their glasses and put away the shaker.</p>
<p>"Did you collect any information?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Not a scrap. Apparently no one knows where we are going or when we shall
get there."</p>
<p>She came a little nearer to him.</p>
<p>"Just now I don't much care."</p>
<p>He ignored the pressure of her fingers upon his arm. His eyes were fixed
upon the tin box.</p>
<p>"I don't believe you've touched it," he observed.</p>
<p>"It's locked," she sighed.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-23" id="ch-23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<p>Charles closed the atlas, which he had been studying, with a snap between
quarter- and half-past six that evening. The great train was slowly slackening
speed. He pointed out to his companion a tiny village composed of a few
white-washed villas with overhanging roofs and fantastic decorations dimly seen
through the trees.</p>
<p>"We are about to stop," he announced. "I'm afraid there is nothing more that
I can do for you, Baroness. I have not asked you what your plans are and I do
not know my own. I shall fight my way into the inn if I can. Perhaps the
station master here will be able to tell us when we move on again."</p>
<p>She seemed suddenly very strange. If such a thing had been possible he would
have thought her nervous. She looked out of the window. They were almost at a
standstill.</p>
<p>"I know where we are," she said. "I have friends living not far away. I must
find them."</p>
<p>"I am sorry to be so ungallant," he regretted. "This is a moment when I can
offer you no further assistance."</p>
<p>"I have wasted all this time," she sighed. "We have sat looking at each
other, my heart has been full, there have been words trembling on my lips. Now
we shall part and they are unspoken. I shall regret it, I know, all my
life."</p>
<p>There was a series of violent jolts. Then they came to a standstill. People
were tumbling out of the carriages in a mad procession. A brawny man in the
uniform of a hotel porter came striding up the platform pushing everyone on one
side. He threw open the door of the <i>coup&eacute;</i>.</p>
<p>"Herr Mildenhall!" he called out. "This way."</p>
<p>He picked up the despatch box, the suitcase and dressing-case. Charles
looked over his shoulder as he turned to follow the porter.</p>
<p>"I am being taken care of, you see, Baroness," he said. "Farewell. We shall
meet, I hope, in happier days."</p>
<p>She still presented the distracted appearance of a woman torn many ways by
opposing impulses. Charles stepped lightly out onto the platform.</p>
<p>"You are from the Schweizerhof ?" he asked.</p>
<p>"<i>Ja wohl, mein Herr</i>," the man replied. "You follow&mdash;yes?"</p>
<p>He strode along the platform, led the way through the little station hall
and out into the street.</p>
<p>"No passport, no tickets?" Charles asked in surprise.</p>
<p>The man grinned.</p>
<p>"Here there is only one station master and one porter," he explained. "The
officials could not deal with a thousand people. That will arrive when the
<i>gn&atilde;diger Herr</i> crosses the frontier. Oh, they will take care to be
there then, without a fear."</p>
<p>Charles followed him across the road to where a straggling and somewhat
shabby edifice described itself on a sprawling placard as "Der
Schweizerhof."</p>
<p>People were already trying to storm the place but the hotel porter lowered
his head and charged straight forward like a bull. Charles followed him
perforce. There was no manager or clerk to be seen. The porter mounted the
stairs and Charles pressed on behind. On the first landing his guide pushed
open a door. Charles found himself in a large bedroom, reasonably clean,
plainly but adequately furnished. The porter stacked the tin box, the
dressing-case and suitcase upon a luggage rack. Then he held out his hand with
a grin.</p>
<p>"Too many people," he grumbled. "Such a crowd have I never seen. This room
is for Herr Mildenhall. Here is the key, sir."</p>
<p>Charles handed him over a fantastic gratuity which the man stared at for a
moment without speech. Then he removed his cap and bowed.</p>
<p>"<i>Danke schon, gn&atilde;diger Herr</i>" he said. "<i>Guten
Abend</i>."</p>
<p>"When will the other portion of the train be in?" Charles asked.</p>
<p>The man shook his head.</p>
<p>"No one knows," he declared. "The station master says that it left Vienna
two hours after yours but that it will have travelled faster."</p>
<p>"One moment, before you go," Charles persisted. "Do you think it would be
possible for me to have a word with the manager?"</p>
<p>The porter looked doubtful. He watched Charles's hand straying once more
towards his pocket.</p>
<p>"The manager's name is Hauser," he confided. "He is afraid of all this
crowd. He saw them jumping out of the train and running across the street as
soon as it stopped. He has shut himself up in his own room/'</p>
<p>"I just want to ask him a friendly question," Charles explained.</p>
<p>His hand was removed from his pocket. The porter watched the note which he
had withdrawn. He retraced his steps and lowered his voice.</p>
<p>"The <i>gn&atilde;diger Herr</i> will follow me down the stairs," he said.
"I shall turn to the left instead of to the right at the bottom, then I walk
along a passage. The last door on the left along that passage will be locked,
but if the gentleman knocks quickly three times it will be opened."</p>
<p>The matter of the note was arranged. Taking the man's advice, Charles locked
up his room and descended the stairs, which were already crowded with people
sitting and lying about. He followed his guide to the bottom of the stairs,
turned to the left and down the passage. The man pointed to a door and promptly
disappeared himself. Charles obeyed his instructions. He knocked sharply three
times, heard a key turn and the latch slowly drawn back. He pushed his way
through. A small man with a sandy moustache recovered his balance and looked up
at him angrily. Charles bowed in his politest fashion to the lady who was
seated at the dining table, smiled on the children and relocked the door.</p>
<p>"You are Herr Hauser, I am sure," he said pleasantly. "I apologize a
thousand times for my intrusion. I am the occupant of number seven, so you see
I am not like all these other people wanting a room."</p>
<p>The frown left the face of the little man.</p>
<p>"You are the English gentleman," he said, "for whom the great Mr. Blute
engaged an apartment?"</p>
<p>"I am he."</p>
<p>"Mr. Blute can command my services at any time," the manager declared. "What
can I do for you, sir?"</p>
<p>"I want to know whether Mr. Blute has engaged rooms for himself and a friend
here."</p>
<p>"He asked for nothing else but a room for Mr. Mildenhall."</p>
<p>"What time do you expect the second portion of the train to arrive for the
frontier?"</p>
<p>"In about one hour's time, sir."</p>
<p>Charles bowed to the lady who, unlike her husband, was very dark indeed and
very fat. He smiled at the manager and turned towards the door.</p>
<p>"I will detain you no longer, Mr. Hauser," he said. "I thank you for the
room."</p>
<p>"The gentleman is welcome," the manager declared, softly unlocking the door.
"The porter will warn you, sir, when the train is starting for the frontier in
the morning."<br>
<br></p>
<p>Charles made his way through the thronged passages, across the crowded
lounge and out into the street. He turned towards the open country. The road,
as straight as a line, disappeared in the heart of a pine wood. He followed it,
walking slowly, pausing every now and then to draw in a deep gulp of the
fragrant air. After his long day of confinement in the ill-ventilated,
unwholesome atmosphere of the railway carriage he felt stimulated, felt somehow
a lessening of the strain of the last few days. The end of this curious
adventure was close at hand. He realized that in twenty-four hours he might be
riding the clouds again. If his half-formed plans came to anything Patricia
might be seated by his side, her sweet, eager little face all alight with the
novelty of the flight and the joy of a difficult task accomplished. The
depression from which he had been suffering was falling from his shoulders.
Then he was confronted with a sudden relapse. A limousine car, rapidly driven,
emerged from the tree-bordered road ahead and came towards him. The road was
narrow and he stepped on to the grass border to avoid the dust. As the car
passed him he recognized its solitary passenger. It was the Baroness, unusually
pale, her large eyes set and fixed, her whole appearance that of a woman who
has received a shock. He stood quite still, startled by her sudden appearance.
He heard her cry of recognition, her sharply spoken order to the chauffeur, the
grinding of the brakes. He turned round to find the car already at a
standstill. He crossed the road and approached her. She had the look of a woman
who had either just passed through a crisis or was preparing to face one.</p>
<p>"Has anything happened?" he asked her.</p>
<p>"Yes," she told him without hesitation. "I am in great distress." I am
sorry.</p>
<p>"I do not know why I stopped you," she continued. "I suppose it was the
sudden excitement of seeing you so unexpectedly. You cannot help me&mdash;or
anyone else...I can give you some news, perhaps."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"England is on the point of declaring war against Germany."</p>
<p>"England alone?"</p>
<p>"France will declare soon afterwards."</p>
<p>"All this was a certainty," he said simply. "Tell me why it has so greatly
affected you."</p>
<p>She made no reply. Somehow or other she seemed very pathetic leaning out of
the car, speaking as though every word were a tragedy. Then she asked him a
question.</p>
<p>"Did you read the letter your friend Lascelles sent to you, the letter in
the tin despatch box?"</p>
<p>"I did."</p>
<p>"You know my history, then?"</p>
<p>"A good deal of it."</p>
<p>"Yet you were pleasant to me to-day."</p>
<p>"I hope so."</p>
<p>"You do not all the time despise me?"</p>
<p>"No. I am sorry about it all."</p>
<p>"Do you know where I was going when I met you?"</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>"You were not very confidential about your movements," he reminded her. "You
spoke of Monte Carlo or Paris."</p>
<p>"I was coming to see if I could find you," she told him. "No," she went on,
"you need not frown. It was only for one reason. I wanted to beg you, to
implore you, to give up your present enterprise. You see, I have guessed what
it is."</p>
<p>He looked at her in astonishment. Slowly his expression began to harden. She
knew the symptoms. She laid her fingers upon his hand.</p>
<p>"Do not be angry with me," she begged. "I am not the woman I was twenty-four
hours ago. I want you to abandon this foolish enterprise. It is beneath your
dignity. You will not succeed. It will probably cost you your life."</p>
<p>"Yes? Is that all you have to say?"</p>
<p>"I am telling you the truth."</p>
<p>"How did you hear about my enterprise, as you call it?"</p>
<p>"As I have heard of others," she answered wearily. "I expect you have heard
me called a spy, a dangerous woman, but what you did not know until you read
that letter, and I do not suppose you appreciate the truth of it even now, is
that although I have a legal right to the name I bear I am also the wife of one
of the world's greatest criminals. I obtained my divorce before I was married
to the Baron but the divorce is worthless. I was married in a Roman Catholic
cathedral. That is enough of the past. Did Mr. Lascelles tell you my real
husband's name?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Charles, won't you take a great weight off my mind?" she pleaded, and in
the softly gathering twilight she was beautiful once more. "Pass on your way to
England, forget the purpose for which you started out, let them carry it on
without you. Will you do this?"</p>
<p>"I cannot."</p>
<p>"It is because you love this girl?"</p>
<p>"Partly."</p>
<p>"No words that I could say will change you?"</p>
<p>"Nothing that you or anyone else could say." She raised his hand to her lips
and kissed it. "Good-bye, Charles."</p>
<p>He heard her give an order to the chauffeur and before he realized it she
was gone. He watched the car disappear in a cloud of dust, then he scrambled
down the bank into the meadow and walked back to the village by the side of a
dashing little stream which had tumbled down from the mountains. Three-quarters
of the way there he heard the roar of a locomotive. He looked across the road.
With its huge engine belching out black smoke the second part of the last train
crawled past him into the station.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-24" id="ch-24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<p>The grim hand of tragedy was suddenly lifted. Charles's depression
disappeared. He was unexpectedly aware of a glow of happiness. It certainly was
not the appearance of the trim, broad-shouldered Mr. Blute who had wrought the
change. It was the sight of the girl by his side in the neat travelling coat,
smart little hat and graceful carriage, whose unrestrained cry of joy and
upraised arms had brought the thrill into his pulses and lifted the weight from
his heart. Charles was not in the least a demonstrative person but it seemed
the most natural thing in the world to stoop down and kiss the eagerly lifted
lips, to smile into those beautiful dancing eyes and draw her hand underneath
his arm.</p>
<p>"It's awfully nice to see you people again!" he exclaimed. "How goes it,
Blute?" he added, dropping his voice.</p>
<p>"So far according to plan," was the impassive reply.</p>
<p>Charles's relief shone out of his face.</p>
<p>"Excellent," he chuckled.</p>
<p>"It seems ages since yesterday," Patricia sighed. "But oh, how wonderful all
this is!"</p>
<p>They were crossing the road slowly towards the Schweizerhof, unnoticed units
of the crowd. She was laughing now at the discomforts of the journey.</p>
<p>"Nine people in the compartment," she confided. "No water to wash in, wine
and biscuits for lunch. Everyone eating horrible messes, windows that opened
with difficulty&mdash;English, French, a few Austrians and dozens of Americans
all jumbled up together. Everyone talking at the same time. But Mr. Blute as
silent as the Sphinx. Charles, will there be any danger?"</p>
<p>"Not a hope, I should think," was the cheerful reply.</p>
<p>"Who cares?" she laughed. "We shall be in Switzerland to-morrow&mdash;the
land of plenty. Charles, do you love Switzerland?"</p>
<p>"To look at&mdash;not to live in. I shall probably love it passionately
to-morrow for a short time."</p>
<p>"Mr. Benjamin used to say that he got nearly the best food in the world at
Geneva. What do you think, Mr. Blute?"</p>
<p>Blute was watching the crowd amongst whom they were slowly making progress.
His eyes seemed to be studying every person there. He walked like a man
self-absorbed yet always watching.</p>
<p>"Switzerland is a great country," he conceded, "but a little difficult to
get into, except during the tourist season. There are times when it is equally
difficult to get out of."</p>
<p>They reached the hotel. The same state of confusion prevailed. An angry
crowd was besieging the telephone booth&mdash;journalists, a French professor
who was frankly pushing people out of his way in his anxiety to reach the
closed door, a screaming woman and two students with knapsacks on their backs
who were loudly lamenting their interrupted holiday. Blute turned away in
disgust.</p>
<p>"I shall try the manager's room," he whispered to Charles. "Come this way
for a moment."</p>
<p>He led them down the passage. A perspiring little waiter greeted Blute with
a grin. The latter caught him by the arm and made a few rapid enquiries. He
turned to Charles.</p>
<p>"This fellow says there is not the slightest chance of any dinner. The
manager himself is dining off the last tureen of soup in his room here. There
is plenty to drink, though. I have ordered you two a vermouth and cassis. Will
you both pass out through the door in front into the garden? The waiter will
find you there."</p>
<p>Blute, who appeared to be perfectly at home in the place, knocked at the
manager's door and disappeared. Charles and his companion passed on into the
grounds, which were rather reminiscent of a tea garden in a London suburb on a
Bank Holiday. People were lying about on the lawn and every seat and bench was
occupied. One man with a map in his hand was already lecturing about the war;
another, an exiled Pole, was making a furious attack upon England and France
who, he said, had guaranteed his country and then were going to declare war a
fortnight too late to save her. Charles and Patricia found a grassy bank at the
far end of the lawn where they seated themselves and looked tolerantly out upon
the scene. The French professor, finally ejected from the room which contained
the telephone box, was striding up and down in silent fury. The waiter who had
recognized Blute came running across the devastated stretch of turf. He had a
bottle in each of his coat pockets and he carried three glasses.</p>
<p>"Vermouth and cassis," he announced to the two as he paused breathless.
"Herr Blute&mdash;he ordered."</p>
<p>Charles took the bottles from him.</p>
<p>"Vermouth and cassis," he remarked. "It's a good enough drink, Patricia. How
much for the three, waiter?"</p>
<p>"Five francs, <i>Monsieur L'Anglais</i>."</p>
<p>"How much for the two bottles?"</p>
<p>"Twenty francs."</p>
<p>Charles handed out the money, added five francs and motioned him away. The
waiter departed, his face wreathed in smiles.</p>
<p>"Delicious!" Patricia exclaimed, sipping hers.</p>
<p>They drank a glassful each. Charles also nodded his approval.</p>
<p>"The civilized person," he observed, "becomes awfully narrow about his
drinks. If I lived to be a hundred I should never have ordered a vermouth and
cassis. Here comes Mr. Blute. We'll mix his."</p>
<p>Blute approached them, walking a shade more quickly than usual, but
otherwise preserving his attitude of stony abstraction. He accepted his drink,
however, and sipped it appreciatively.</p>
<p>"I regret to say," he announced, "that there is not a room to be had in the
hotel. For forty people the lounge is reserved. The dining hall being
empty&mdash;there is no food here to be served&mdash;it is also turned into a
dormitory. Two American tourists, students from Grenoble, a man and a girl on
their honeymoon, have commandeered the billiard table. There seems really to be
not an inch of space vacant. I did not book rooms in advance because having
done so for Mr. Mildenhall I did not wish it to appear that we were travelling
in his company."</p>
<p>Charles laughed gaily.</p>
<p>"You're over-scrupulous, my friend," he declared. "I still hope to be in
London only a day after I was expected, and when I am on the sort of mission I
have been engaged on during the last two months I make my own plans and choose
my own company."</p>
<p>"They would not have been able to keep the rooms, in any case," Blute
remarked. "The people on the first train forced their way in."</p>
<p>"And things otherwise are going all right?" Charles asked, a lingering note
of anxiety still in his tone.</p>
<p>"Everything goes like clockwork. The guards have permission to sleep in the
van. That I arranged in Vienna. They brought their food with them. I paid them
a farewell visit just before we reached this place and found them at their
posts perfectly satisfied and ready for anything. The guard of the train has
already taken possession of the cases which are supposed to contain the effects
of the victims and he assures me that there is not the faintest chance of
trouble with the Customs. I shall not worry any longer about these by-way
telephones. We shall go through to Z&uuml;rich and from there I know I can
ascertain Mr. Benjamin's whereabouts."</p>
<p>"In the meantime I have an idea," Charles said. "We mount from here to my
bedroom. There we can talk undisturbed. Afterwards, naturally. Miss Grey will
occupy it. You and I, Blute, can easily sleep out of doors if necessary."</p>
<p>"I could sleep very well where we are," Blute assented, "but your room will
be an excellent refuge for a short time. I don't fancy this mixed crowd of
people all around us."</p>
<p>They rose to their feet and made their way through the uneasy mob into the
hotel and up the stairs. Charles unlocked his door and threw open the
windows.</p>
<p>"Not so bad," he declared cheerfully. "There is soap, water and one clean
towel for Miss Grey if she should care to use them. The air which comes in
through the windows is not at all bad and furthermore&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Something left from your luncheon?" Patricia exclaimed, jumping up with a
whirl of her skirts and seizing the basket which he had been holding out.</p>
<p>He drew back the fastenings and lifted the cover, raised a <i>serviette</i>
and smiled.</p>
<p>"Behold! The offering of the best hotel manager in Europe left neglected at
the time it was meant to be eaten but welcome as never was food welcomed before
by us three hungry mortals."</p>
<p>"And I never knew I was really greedy," Patricia murmured as she lifted the
second <i>serviette</i>. "A whole chicken, a delicious cheese, rolls, butter,
fruit! Charles, I must be greedy! I am going to cry."</p>
<p>"A sure sign," he observed, undoing the inside straps, producing a dish and
beginning to carve the chicken. "Well turn my suitcase off the luggage. Stand
and use that for a table. We must sit on the bed. But wait a moment&mdash;you
carve the chicken, Blute."</p>
<p>He rummaged in his dressing-case and produced the cocktail shaker.</p>
<p>"I have no words of gratitude and thanks left," Patricia sighed. "My greed
has conquered my emotions. You men had better divide the cocktail. I can have
more vermouth and cassis. Besides, there's a delicious bottle of white wine
here."</p>
<p>"The wine I drank for my dinner last night&mdash;Gumpoldskirchner," he
remarked, drawing it from the basket. "A terrific name but an excellent
flavour."</p>
<p>"The best Austrian wine that's grown," Blute declared. "You two can play
about with the <i>ap&eacute;ritif</i>&mdash;I'll wait for the wine."</p>
<p>They finished their meal in supreme content. Patricia insisted upon rolling
up her sleeves and washing the plates. Afterwards, they sat by the open window
and over the station roof watched the outline of the mountains in the distance.
Darkness had come and Charles broke up a somewhat spasmodic conversation.</p>
<p>"I think we'd better leave you, Patricia," he suggested. "We're all tired
and we shall have to be up early in the morning."</p>
<p>"Nothing of the sort," Patricia protested. "I am not going to take your
room, Charles. I shouldn't think of it. You were up long before we were this
morning."</p>
<p>"The matter," Charles declared, "is not worth an argument. I am no Sir
Philip Sidney but I should hate to go through life remembering that a few
nights before our wedding I let my wife sleep with all the rest of this
picnicking Bank Holiday crowd whilst I revelled in the luxury of
this&mdash;er&mdash;truckle bedstead!"</p>
<p>"Please, Charles!" she begged with something suspiciously like a blush on
her cheeks. "I'm much more used to roughing it than you are."</p>
<p>Charles abandoned the discussion. He took a couple of bottles from his
dressing-case and a clean handkerchief and joined Blute at the door.</p>
<p>"Sleep well, my dear Patricia," he enjoined. "Brace yourself up for those
few minutes of agony tomorrow. I have a feeling somehow or other that no one
will do more than glance at our passports, that the Customs men will be so busy
that they will just wave our baggage on one side and that we shall be making
our brief farewells within half-an-hour of crossing the frontier. What do you
say, Blute?"</p>
<p>"When I am engaged upon a serious enterprise," the latter replied, "I
concentrate the whole of the time upon its successful accomplishment. I think
of nothing else. The details are always before me. This time I feel that
nothing has been forgotten, there is nothing that can intervene. We shall miss
you, Mr. Mildenhall, and I know that Mr. Benjamin will not rest until he has
thanked you personally for all your assistance."</p>
<p>"What shall you do with all your treasures if you find that Mr. Benjamin is
in London, say?"</p>
<p>"I shall deposit everything in the safety vaults of a Z&uuml;rich bank,"
Blute confided. "Switzerland is the most secure country in Europe for anything
of that sort. I shall then buy half-a-dozen maps, read all the newspapers which
I have neglected for the last fortnight and absorb myself in a study of the
war. I take a great interest in wars. I regret to say that so far I have come
to the conclusion that there would be no wars but for the professional
politicians and the newspapers."</p>
<p>"What about the little trouble over at Carthage?" Charles asked.</p>
<p>"The world of to-day lacks primitive passion," Blute declared. "It no longer
exists as a motive."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't be so sure," Charles meditated. "They say that even the great
man of Germany is crazy about a dancing girl. Personally, I can see myself
purchasing a second-hand suit of armour and a two-edged sword to rescue my
princess from an invader."</p>
<p>"But as your princess," Patricia reminded him, "happens to be a little
red-haired typist with green eyes and not in the least like any princess that
was ever dreamed of, and as she has a father, by the by, who is a college
professor and doesn't approve of fighting, what are you going to do about
it?"</p>
<p>"I should win her with song and written words," he replied. "The troubadour
might triumph where the warrior had failed! Come along, Blute. We will leave
this young lady to her dreams."</p>
<p>"I'm terribly ashamed," she confessed with a glance at the bed.
"Still&mdash;good night, both of you. Please kiss me, Charles. Mr. Blute isn't
looking."</p>
<p>"Mr. Blute," that gentleman remarked, "is a person of discretion."<br>
<br></p>
<p>The two men wandered out into the garden and found a retired, unoccupied
seat. There were still muffled scraps of conversation from all around but very
little gaiety. One of a small party of students struck up a few notes on a
ukulele but was driven into retreat by a shower of miscellaneous missiles. The
night itself was curiously still and there was a sense of thunder in the air.
Blute began to talk. His voice had no expression&mdash;it was changeless in its
tone. He began to talk of wars, of chance words spoken in secret places by
irresponsible people, of the crackle of inflammable materials as gossiping
tongues trifled with serious subjects and lit the bonfires which were to scorch
the world.</p>
<p>"All wars," he said, addressing himself to no one in particular, "would die
out and the spirit of warfare would perish if it were not for the gross things
of life. There are no more Wars of the Roses, no more passionate journeys
across the desert on the part of holy men, although they wore armour and
carried swords by their sides. No more struggles to free the world from tyranny
and barbarism, to set free the nations that have fallen by the wayside.
Nowadays, the armament makers light the flame and the newspaper millionaires
fan it. It has become a sickly and a horrible thing&mdash;but so long as the
world exists war will continue because evil will dominate. There are more evil
qualities in the world than good ones and behind it all, deep enough
underneath, there is the fascination of the struggle to the man who has brain
but no emotion. That is the man who enjoys warfare."</p>
<p>Charles, who had been half dozing, sat up.</p>
<p>"I have never heard you talk so much in my life, Blute!"</p>
<p>"I never have a chance to talk. I am always afraid of speech. I am a man of
action, of secret underground action. I like to work where no other men can
intrude. I am a rich man but I am not a money grabber. I am a man who loves
gratitude but I am not a philanthropist. Within a few hours I shall bring, I
hope, to a successful end one of the greatest enterprises of my life. You are a
newcomer, Mr. Mildenhall, to the world I have made my own. I saw what was
coming to the Jews years before they dreamed of it themselves. As far as I ever
feel friendship for anyone I felt friendship and reverence for Leopold
Benjamin. I set myself to work on his affairs. Millions upon millions that his
father and grandfather had made I removed quietly, inconspicuously from the
dangerous places. I made that the business of my life. I encouraged him in
those great sums he used to pay for <i>objets d'art</i>. A work of genius is
always a marketable thing. Sometimes he was puzzled. It seemed to him that he
must be growing poorer. The millions that used to be in Hamburg, the huge iron
works that were run entirely with his capital, the ships that took the seas,
the streets of palaces in Berlin and Frankfurt&mdash;all the money which had
brought these things into being and which supported them slipped quietly away.
There was always more money to take its place from a hundred different sources.
Leopold was sometimes frightened. 'Blute,' he used to say to me, 'you are
making a poor man of me.' And I smiled. It will be a moment of triumph for me
when we meet. Not only shall I restore to him the pictures he loves, the
treasures of his life, but I shall tell him, and it is a wonderful thing to
tell any man, aye, not only tell him but prove to him with the figures which
weary him so much, that he is the richest man in the world."</p>
<p>"Are we still talking fairy stories?" Charles asked.</p>
<p>"I talk because I feel like it," Blute said calmly. "I very seldom feel like
it. You must be a good listener, Mr. Mildenhall. You have an inborn gift for
it. Now I am going to sleep."</p>
<p>He closed his eyes. All around them the murmur of voices was growing fainter
and fainter.<br>
<br></p>
<p>Charles was awakened by someone pulling his arm. He heard a scared foreign
voice in his ear.</p>
<p>"Wake up, sir, please wake up!"</p>
<p>He opened his eyes and sat up quickly. It was the sandy-haired little
manager still in his soiled grey-linen suit.</p>
<p>"It is the young lady who travels with Mr. Blute," he declared. "She rang
the bell. She declares that two men have been in her room. She declares that
they were tampering with your luggage, sir."</p>
<p>Charles, followed by Blute, crossed the lawn swiftly and mounted the now
deserted stairs. The door of number seven stood ajar. Patricia was standing
upon the threshold clad in a dark green dressing-gown, with slippers upon her
bare feet. She was breathing rapidly and there was fear in her eyes.</p>
<p>"I awoke suddenly," she called out to Charles. "I felt there was someone in
the room. There were two men. They were trying to open your tin case."</p>
<p>"What's become of them?" Charles asked quickly.</p>
<p>"I turned on the light and screamed," Patricia told him. "I rang the bell
and screamed&mdash;"</p>
<p>The little proprietor nodded.</p>
<p>"<i>Mademoiselle</i> did indeed make herself heard," he chimed in. "I am
sitting up all night myself to collect money from these people before they
leave. I ran upstairs. I passed one man on the landing. He was running with his
head down."</p>
<p>Charles handled the despatch box.</p>
<p>"Well," he remarked, "he was a very poor sort of burglar."</p>
<p>"Nothing has been stolen?" Patricia gasped.</p>
<p>"Not a thing," Charles assured her. "A key to the door I dare say the man
might find easily, but the key to open this despatch box is a different
matter."</p>
<p>"No papers gone&mdash;nothing?" Herr Hauser asked.</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>The proprietor expressed his satisfaction.</p>
<p>"It is useless to give an alarm," he said. "The police are all called
up."</p>
<p>"How did the fellow open the door?" Blute asked.</p>
<p>"Alas," the manager confessed, "the keys are all the same. Still, nothing
has been stolen," he continued, looking round. "That is good. I am sorry that
<i>Mademoiselle</i> was frightened. It is a difficult time."</p>
<p>Patricia sat down. She was still trembling.</p>
<p>"You can have your room, please, Mr. Mildenhall," she said. "The keys are
useless. How could I sleep dreading every minute that that man would come back
again? Perhaps both of them."</p>
<p>The manager expressed his sympathy once more.</p>
<p>"The gentlemen have only a seat in the garden," he told her. "If
<i>Mademoiselle</i> does not object, they should lie down here. There is the
couch for one gentleman, a rug and a cushion for the other. Remember,
gentlemen, if you please, that this is only one night in a lifetime. I do my
best, Herr Blute."</p>
<p>"Quite right, Hauser," Blute agreed. "If you do not object, Miss Grey," he
added, "we will be your protectors."</p>
<p>She smiled on them both.</p>
<p>"I think it is a very good arrangement. Now I shall sleep in peace. As the
manager has just told us, it is but one night in a lifetime."</p>
<p>Charles threw himself down on the hearth-rug with a pillow under his head.
Blute leaned a little anxiously over him and whispered in his ear.</p>
<p>"Sure they didn't get at your papers?"</p>
<p>"There are no papers," Charles whispered back. "The box is full of my soiled
linen!"</p>
<p>Blute retired to his couch smiling. This was his own way of doing things.
Charles was more than ever a young man after his own heart.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-25" id="ch-25"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<p>For some reason or other there was an air of greater calm about the place
the next morning when Charles, after his morning coffee with Patricia in the
garden, strolled down the road in front of the hotel smoking a cigarette. Some
people were already taking their places in the train which, however, was not to
start for another half-hour. Blute was engaged in conversation with the four
guardians of his treasure who, having had their morning coffee and rolls
brought to them, were sitting about on the steps of the van smoking. Herr
Hauser, who seemed for some reason or other, Charles thought, to be avoiding
him, was back in his place in his bureau collecting money from every one of the
hotel visitors of the night before. Blute stepped over the paling which led on
to the railway line and joined Charles.</p>
<p>"Get any sleep?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Not much," Charles answered truthfully. "Cut myself shaving, too. I love
cold water for everything in the world except to shave with."</p>
<p>"You should have waited till we arrived in Z&uuml;rich," Blute told him.
"All the luxuries in the world there, including a wonderful hairdressing
establishment."</p>
<p>Charles glanced around and dropped his voice a little.</p>
<p>"I have decided not to go on to Z&uuml;rich," he confided. "Once across the
Swiss frontier you won't need me any more. I have a small chateau, as you know,
that I've used for a sort of headquarters when I've been doing my tramps round
Europe. It's a little place called Felsen, not many kilometres across the
frontier. I have telephoned this morning for my plane to be put in order and
got ready for me and I shall fly direct to England. That way I shall avoid all
risk of getting into trouble."</p>
<p>"What does Miss Grey say to that?"</p>
<p>"I haven't told her yet. I think she'll be glad. I shall ask her to come
with me but I think she'll decide that she must stay with you."</p>
<p>"Well, that's her affair," Blute observed. "I can't trust these country
telephones. I shan't attempt to speak to Paris until we get to Z&uuml;rich,
then I know I can find out Mr. Benjamin's whereabouts. There is to be a
passport examination here in the train before we start. They've just stuck up a
notice."</p>
<p>"What's the idea?"</p>
<p>"A very good one, I should think. It will save at least an hour to an
hour-and-a-half at the frontier town and here nobody's doing anything until the
line is clear for us to go on. The two passport men have just arrived in a car.
I've taken a place for you in the dining saloon. There's no service there, of
course, but you won't want that and I'd rather we both kept away from you as
much as possible. Once across the frontier we can all join up. Miss Grey is
still very nervous that if ever this expedition of ours is talked about you
will get into trouble. I think I'll go into the hotel and tell her to come and
take her place. I'll send your bags here, if you like."</p>
<p>"Send out that lusty porter. I owe him a <i>pourboire</i>."</p>
<p>The two passport men came and took their seats at the farther end of the
dining car just as Charles settled down in his corner. The superior of the two
recognized him and bowed. He came over and shook hands.</p>
<p>"Saving you a little trouble, Herr Mildenhall," he said.</p>
<p>"A very good idea," Charles replied. "You may as well start with me. How are
your wife and family?"</p>
<p>"Excellently, I thank you, <i>mein Herr</i>."</p>
<p>He took Charles's passport to the desk, wrote the usual inscription, stamped
and returned it with a little bow. He had always a great respect for diplomatic
passports. Charles thrust it in his pocket and established himself comfortably
with his luggage in the rack above him. He was just settling down when he
noticed a car approaching at great speed along the level stretch of road by the
side of the railway. He recognized it at once. Beatrice, who was alone,
descended and disappeared in the station. A moment or two later she entered the
dining car from the other end and presented herself to the passport examiners.
She talked with them for some few minutes and it was obvious from her
expression that there was some trouble. She looked around and recognized
Charles. With a word to the passport <i>chef</i> she left his extempore desk
and came to Charles's corner.</p>
<p>"Mr. Mildenhall," she said, "I think you must be more tired of seeing me
than any woman on earth. I need your help. Again I am a suppliant."</p>
<p>"What is there that I can do for you?" he asked a little dubiously.</p>
<p>"My passport," she told him, "has been stolen."</p>
<p>He raised his eyebrows slowly.</p>
<p>"That is rather a serious matter, isn't it?"</p>
<p>She leaned towards him. He was looking at her curiously. The early morning
sunlight treated her kindly but it was the face of a very serious woman which
was inclined towards his. Her eyes, which had danced so often with joy, were
full of trouble. She seemed somehow or other to belong to a different
world.</p>
<p>"I slept last night," she went on, "at the chateau of some
friends&mdash;indeed, I might say a relative. Early this morning I was awakened
by someone in my room. I gave the alarm. A man was seen to disappear down the
drive on a motor bicycle. I searched my belongings. Only one thing was
stolen&mdash;my passport."</p>
<p>The <i>chef</i> at the other end of the dining car left his seat and came
towards them.</p>
<p>"With every desire to help Madame," he said, bowing to Charles, "it is, of
course, impossible for us to issue a passport here on the train."</p>
<p>"But listen," she persisted, drawing a leather-bound object from her bag. "I
have an old passport here. It is out of date but it could be extended."</p>
<p>"There are difficulties about that," the man objected.</p>
<p>She turned to Charles.</p>
<p>"Mr. Mildenhall," she begged, "send him away for one moment."</p>
<p>"The lady has something to confide to me," Charles told the official.</p>
<p>The latter smiled and drew back. The Baroness looked into her companion's
eyes.</p>
<p>"Charles," she said, "I am not a bad woman. I have never deceived anyone
whom I have loved. I pray you&mdash;it is for your sake as well as
mine&mdash;get me that passport."</p>
<p>"For my sake?"</p>
<p>"I will take that back, but you will do a great, a wonderful kindness to a
woman who is suffering if you will get me that passport, and you will do no
harm nor bring any harm upon any human being in the world."</p>
<p>She returned his steadfast gaze without flinching. Then he rose to his feet
and drew the passport inspector outside the car.</p>
<p>"The lady is honest, I believe," he said. "And her need for the passport is
very real. You may lose promotion by doing a generous action. Let this
recompense you."</p>
<p>The notes passed into the man's hand. He thrust them into his pocket.</p>
<p>"Come with me to the table, sir," he said.</p>
<p>Charles obeyed. The man took up the old passport and placed a pen between
Charles's fingers.</p>
<p>"Sign your name, please, as sponsor there," he begged, pointing to a certain
place.</p>
<p>Charles did as he was told.</p>
<p>"Now write on this sheet of paper to me, sir:</p>
<blockquote>"The Baroness von Ballinstrode has urgent need of a passport to
replace the one stolen from her this morning. I guarantee her probity and that
her name and the other particulars upon the passport which is out of date are
true."</blockquote>
<p>Charles did as he was asked. The man blotted the piece of paper, placed it
inside the document and presented it to the Baroness with a bow.</p>
<p>"That, Madame," he said, "will pass you over the frontier to-day. I should
advise you, though, as soon as you have an opportunity to take out a fresh
passport."</p>
<p>Beatrice smiled her thanks. She held Charles's hand for a moment in hers.
Then she swung around and without a backward glance stepped off the car.
Charles returned to his place.</p>
<p>"God knows what old Blute would say to me," he muttered to himself.<br>
<br></p>
<p>Ten o'clock came at last. Punctually they jogged slowly out of the station.
Charles tried to settle down to read. It was impossible. The dining car was now
full of passengers, some having their passports examined, others engaging in
eager conversation. The short journey to the frontier seemed to Charles
absolutely intolerable. He smoked several cigarettes, finally gave it up, put
away his book and sat with folded arms and eyes resolutely turned away from the
windows. They gained a little speed, slackened again and then came to a sudden
stop. They were under the roof of a station. The platforms were crowded with
shouting porters and streams of people passed the windows on their way to the
Customs shed. Charles yielded over his belongings to a couple of blue-smocked
men and told them to follow him to the office. Here he enquired for one of the
<i>chefs</i> by name, exhibited his passport and pointed to his bags. The man
scrawled across them.</p>
<p>"Diplomatic," he grunted to the porters. "Passed."</p>
<p>The fortunate passenger made his way back to the train. With a great effort
he obeyed Blute's request and made no attempt to discover either of his
travelling companions. He entered the <i>buffet</i>, drank half a bottle of
Swiss wine, paced up and down the platform for half-an-hour and then regained
his seat. From a post of vantage he looked out on a very quaint spectacle. Two
station officials were standing at the entrance to the private luggage van with
their hats in their hands. Mr. Blute, one of the little group, was signing
papers with a fountain pen. Charles heard some people on their way past the car
speak of the terrible accident in the north and tell others that the bodies of
the victims were on their way back to Grenoble for burial. Finally it was all
over. Mr. Blute shook hands warmly with the officials and disappeared into the
train. Very slowly it jolted out of the station.<br>
<br></p>
<p>In less than quarter-of-an-hour there was another halt. This time there was
only a platform with no station, but the former was crowded with another
company of officials. The examination, however, was only of passports and
railway tickets. The period of tension, brief though it was, seemed to pass
very slowly. At last they were moving again. They slipped farther and farther
away from the entanglement of sidings and signal boxes. They began to gather
speed. They were in the open country. The door of the dining car was suddenly
swung open. Marius Blute and Patricia made their appearance. The former was
carrying a bottle of champagne under his arm, the strain had gone from his
face, a thin but genuine smile was parting his lips.</p>
<p>"Our effort is accomplished," he announced. "We are safely in Switzerland.
There is nothing more to be feared. I bought a bottle of Swiss champagne at the
buffet. The attendant has given me three glasses. We will drink to our success,
we will drink to one another, we will drink to this happy event which seems to
be pending between you. Miss Grey, and Mr. Mildenhall!"</p>
<p>"Dear me," she laughed, "I'm getting so used to the idea of being married to
you, Charles!"</p>
<p>"You will never get used to it," he declared as he drew the cork from the
bottle and filled the glasses. "You will find being married to me fills life
with continual novelty, you will find no time even to pity the many millions
who cannot have that happiness."</p>
<p>"I shall devote the earlier part of our life together," she said severely,
"towards filing down the sharp edges of your conceit."</p>
<p>"So easily done," he murmured. "The great success of my life&mdash;the
winning of Patricia&mdash;has turned my head a little."</p>
<p>"You two seem booked for a happy time, if you go on like this," Blute
declared. "Where's the wedding going to be?"</p>
<p>And then, before either of them could deal with this rapturous subject,
there came a sudden shock. The handsome guard of the train who had had nothing
but smiles for them since the commencement of the journey came hurrying to
where they were seated. He had lost alike his dignity, his composure and his
slight swagger. He looked over his shoulder. There was no one within hearing.
He leaned towards Blute. His voice shook.</p>
<p>"Did you ever hear of the Three G's, sir?"</p>
<p>Blute started as though he had been struck.</p>
<p>"What&mdash;the Gervaise Gunther Gang?"</p>
<p>"They're here&mdash;in the train&mdash;spread about! I've counted ten. One
of them has tried twice to get into the van."</p>
<p>"Is Gervaise himself here?" Blute groaned.</p>
<p>"I shouldn't think so, sir. I have not seen him. He never travels with the
others."</p>
<p>For the first time in her life Patricia saw Blute temporarily overcome. His
hand trembled. He spilt some of the wine as he set down his glass.</p>
<p>"Who on earth is Gervaise Gunther?" Charles demanded. "Docs he bite?"</p>
<p>Neither of the two men answered him. Both seemed overpowered.</p>
<p>This was no moment for frivolity. Patricia looked at them and her own heart
sank.</p>
<p>"Is this what you were afraid of?" she asked Blute.</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>"No, I was afraid of a Nazi <i>coup</i>. I thought that they might have sent
a special enquiry guard to the frontier. Gervaise&mdash;I never thought of him.
I have had not a single word of warning from anyone. I thought he was in New
York."</p>
<p>"The same fellow is on the train," the guard went on, his voice half-choked
with fright, "as the last time I saw any of them. It was when they stopped and
robbed the Orient Express and got away with a hundred-thousand pounds worth of
jewels. I saw this man put on his mask three minutes before the hold-up. There
he sits to-day, the same man. He knew that I recognized him and he just winked.
They say that Gervaise himself was at a caf&eacute; in Budapest two days after
the robbery with his mistress, who was wearing some of the jewellery! No one
dared lay a finger upon him. It will be the same again."</p>
<p>Charles suddenly began to realize the situation.</p>
<p>"Good God!" he exclaimed. "Are these men after our stuff?"</p>
<p>"They are indeed," Blute groaned. "He is the only man in the underworld I
have ever feared. When I first planned this <i>coup</i>, Mildenhall, long
before I spoke to you about it, I sent wires to New York, Chicago, Paris,
London, Marseilles and I had combed Vienna, as I thought, to the bone for news
of this man. Not a single police headquarters, not a single private agent, no
one in Vienna had heard of him for years. They all declared that he was not
working. I dropped him out of my calculation. Are you sure that he's not on the
train himself, guard?"</p>
<p>"I am sure," the latter replied. "I am the only man who could recognize him.
Last time we met I passed him as a stranger. If I had given him away by so much
as a blink I should not have lived another ten seconds."</p>
<p>"How did you find this out?" Blute asked.</p>
<p>"The little lieutenant, the man I told you I recognized from last time,
called me in to him just now. He was rolling a thousand <i>schilling</i> note
in his hand. He had the same thin, squeaky voice. It gave me a shiver all
through my body when I recognized it. 'Guard,' he said, looking me straight in
the face, 'I would like you to stop this train for a few minutes at Alteren.'
He opened his hand and I saw the note. I had to be careful. There was something
else bulging in his pocket and his fingers were creeping around the bulge. I'm
talking to you now at the risk of my life."</p>
<p>"Where is Alteren?" Charles asked.</p>
<p>"It is just a signal box. We should be there in half-an-hour's time. It's
rather a lonely spot with trees on either side of the track."</p>
<p>"What did you say?"</p>
<p>"I promised I would speak to the engine driver."</p>
<p>"How many of these fellows do you think there are?" Blute demanded.</p>
<p>"I've recognized ten, sir. That's the number he generally works with."</p>
<p>"You don't think Gervaise himself is on the train, then?" Blute
persisted.</p>
<p>"I am sure he is not. He has a swagger with him that no one can mistake. He
has the voice and manner, too, of a well-bred man."</p>
<p>"The way he's worked it out," Blute speculated, "is probably like this. When
we reach Alteren he will probably pick up the gang and the loot in a powerful
motor lorry. If he sees it's all right when the train stops, he'll just slip
into the affair as naturally as possible. If none of his men are in sight he'll
know there's a hitch and he'll be off like a flash. He won't be seen again for
a year or two. There's only one thing for us to do," he added grimly. "We must
get into the van and shoot it out with them."</p>
<p>Charles's hesitation was only a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>"Look here," he proposed, "I have a better scheme."</p>
<p>"Out with it quick, then," Blute begged.</p>
<p>Charles dragged out his watch.</p>
<p>"The train is being stopped for me in less than ten minutes from now just
opposite my little chateau at Felsen, where I was going to break away. There is
a siding there. To start with we three must make our way into the van right
away. Just before we get to Felsen, guard, you must loosen the couplings and
detach them altogether with the brakes on. We'll be ready to jump out with the
guards and all our luggage before anyone else realizes what we are doing.
Meanwhile the train itself won't stop and it will be out of sight in no time.
If this cheerful gang of desperadoes you are talking about tumble to what's
happening and jump the train we shall fight it out with them, but at this speed
I don't think they'll risk it."</p>
<p>"It's a good scheme," the guard cried feverishly.</p>
<p>"It's the best chance you've got, anyway, and I'm with you."</p>
<p>"Well, there you are," Charles concluded. "There will be six of us all armed
and we shall have the stuff in the grounds before they can stop the train and
get out in the regular way. If we can get as far as the chateau itself there
are one or two servants of mine up there who are used to a rough-house."</p>
<p>They were all on their feet now. Blute laid his hand on Charles's
shoulder.</p>
<p>"There's only one thing against this scheme, Mr. Mildenhall," he said
gruffly. "You'll be let down completely. You'll be marked down as one of a gang
of thieves, even if we are only trying to save a man's property from a greedy
State."</p>
<p>"That be damned!" Charles scoffed. "I'll take my chance. Miss Grey, of
course, must stay in the train."</p>
<p>"Miss Grey will do nothing of the sort," Patricia declared passionately. "I
am coming down to the van with you now and if anything goes wrong and they try
to rush us I shall fight it out with the rest of you. I'll take the first gun
there is to spare from either side. I can shoot pretty straight, I promise
you."</p>
<p>The guard looked out of the window and glanced at the watch he held in his
shaking fingers.</p>
<p>"No time to argue, gentlemen," he insisted.</p>
<p>He snatched Charles's bags from the rack and led his three passengers along
towards the end of the car. They hurried through the kitchen adjoining, through
another door and out on to the iron platform.</p>
<p>"Into the van with you!" the guard insisted. "You three must hurry. I must
stop to see about the couplings. I shall have to lie down on my stomach to do
that job while she's going. I shall manage it, though. It will be a nasty jerk,
mind, when she breaks away. Into the van, please! You will find it difficult to
get across that last bit when she begins to sway."</p>
<p>He stood on one side and they hurried past him. There was an open space
bridged over by only a narrow footway into the van. Blute shouted and one of
the four guardians held out his hand and helped him across. One by one they
safely negotiated the passage. Blute explained the situation in a few
breathless words.</p>
<p>"If they try to follow us this way," he pointed out, "we'll kill the lot of
them before they get across. A bullet a time and over they go. They won't get
here in time, though. The guard will have disconnected us and we shall be half
a mile away even if they get hold of the engine driver and make him stop the
train."</p>
<p>"They won't do that, sir," the guard, holding on to an iron rod and looking
up from his horizontal position, called out. "There's a locked door between
them and the engine. I shall be telephoning to the driver directly to put on
steam. I should not be surprised if you are not safely in the chateau before
they can leave the train...There goes the first of the couplings!"</p>
<p>They were beginning to wobble now. Charles half carried Patricia to the far
end of the car and placed her by one of the cases.</p>
<p>"You crawl down behind that, young woman," he enjoined, "and don't go
bobbing your head up to see who's hit. Listen to me&mdash;and you, too,
Blute&mdash;because I know the country here. If the train gets half a mile away
before the gang are on the track it's a cinch for us! We have a gate over the
narrow road that runs level with the railway and an open entrance up the avenue
to the chateau. Once inside there we're safe. Now then, what about the
caskets?"</p>
<p>"We can each carry one or drag it," the chief of the guardians declared.
"They're no great weight. We'll have to come back for the boxes."</p>
<p>"As long as we get them across the road we can send down for them," Charles
said. "We must hide them inside the wood bordering the road."</p>
<p>He knelt down by Patricia's side. She came very close to him.</p>
<p>"There's plenty of cover, Blute," he called out. "Come farther back."</p>
<p>Blute concluded his rapid orders to the four men and changed his position
slightly.</p>
<p>"Look out!" he warned them. "We shall all go head over heels when that last
coupling is loosened and the brake's on."</p>
<p>There was a sudden hissing of steam, a shriek from the metals. They were on
the siding, very nearly jumping it. The van rocked from side to side as the
brakes began to bite, then they slackened down to a crawl and came to a
standstill. They rushed for the door which Blute had opened and jumped safely
on to the track. The disappearing train was already well away and the engine
driver had done even better than his instructions. He had put on speed to such
an extent that, although one or two of the doors had opened and the forms of
several men were visible hanging out as though they meant to jump, not one of
them tried it. The most daring of their enemies had apparently rushed through
the dining car and the kitchen and, leaning over the platform at the end of the
carriage, had fired one abortive shot. The train was gathering speed every
moment.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-26" id="ch-26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<p>"That's trick number one for us," Blute declared, springing lightly down on
to the permanent way. "Two of you fellows come down here and the others pass
the caskets to us."</p>
<p>They promptly obeyed. Afterwards they found the gate leading from the
railway line to the road opened with a latch and the gate up the avenue to the
chateau was easily flung back. One by one they dragged the caskets and then the
three cases across the rails, the bordering roadway and into a place of
security behind some shrubs in the chateau park.</p>
<p>"It's trick number one for us, all right," Blute repeated, pausing to wipe
his forehead, "but we're not quite out of the wood yet. How many men did you
say you have up there, Mr. Mildenhall?"</p>
<p>"Well, I haven't been there for over twelve months," Charles reflected.
"There was an old housekeeper who looked after things&mdash;I took her over
from the last proprietor. Then there were two indoor menservants, a youth who
looked after the electricity and telephone&mdash;we've always done a lot of
long-distance telephoning from here&mdash;three men in the garden and a
woodman."</p>
<p>"Any weapons?"</p>
<p>"Not much in that way, I'm afraid. There are two or three sporting guns. A
number five shot from a highly charged cartridge out of a Purdy gun is not to
be sneezed at! No rifles, I'm afraid, but I'm sure there are a couple of
revolvers. The servants are mostly Swiss but a pretty decent lot as far as I
can remember. Needham, the butler, is really in charge. I'm afraid they get
very slack when I'm away for a time. I couldn't get hold of any of the servants
whom I remembered when I rang up but the chauffeur's voice was familiar and he
told me he knew all about the plane and would see that it was got ready. He
promised, too, to have the cars looked over. I suggest that we three go
straight on up to the chateau and leave the cases here for the present. We can
send down some more men to help bring them up. I know we have one lorry at
least and a large car which should carry the lot. You can start off when you
like."</p>
<p>Blute hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>"We must have transport," he reflected. "The only thing I'm bothered about
is supposing the Three G's get the train stopped and hurry back here."</p>
<p>Charles pointed to the range of mountains ahead.</p>
<p>"They've got to get to the other side of those before they come to a town of
any size," he confided. "Even if they got the train stopped, there would be
nothing to bring them back. It's nothing but rough mountain country for fifty
or sixty kilometres. There's one military post but that wouldn't do them any
good."</p>
<p>"We'll do as you propose then," Blute agreed. "Wait just a moment while I
have a few words with the men."<br>
<br></p>
<p>"It's a lovely old place," Patricia remarked as they drew nearer to the
house on their upward climb. "I love the towers at the corner and the long
sweep of the front."</p>
<p>"It's more French than Swiss, I'm glad to say," Charles pointed out. "I
don't altogether like the look of the place, though," he went on, glancing
disparagingly around. "The grounds look very neglected and I can't see a single
gardener about. I fancy I can hear someone in the flying field, though, and
there's smoke enough from the chimneys. As soon as we've got our luggage up we
must see what Madame can do for luncheon."</p>
<p>"Have you a very good cook?" Patricia asked wistfully.</p>
<p>"Pretty fair so far as they go," he answered. "I have never done a great
deal of entertaining here. It was a very useful headquarters to write reports
from and it is quite near several frontiers. Here we are!"</p>
<p>They crossed the paved courtyard; Charles pulled the huge iron bell chain,
turned the great handle of the front door and pushed it open. There was a large
but silent and gloomy hall. A man issued from the back regions and made his way
towards them. He was dressed in dark livery but Charles looked at him
puzzled.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" he asked.</p>
<p>The man stared at him for a moment, then he smiled a little
superciliously.</p>
<p>"I was about to ask you the same question," he confided. "Whom do you want
to see?"</p>
<p>"I want to see Needham, my butler," Charles replied. "My name is Mildenhall.
The chateau belongs to me. I telephoned to say that I was coming."</p>
<p>The man looked at him for a moment in blank astonishment, then he moved
across the hall and threw open the door of a large reception room.</p>
<p>"Some visitors for you, sir," he announced. "The younger gentleman says that
his name is Mildenhall and that he owns the chateau."</p>
<p>The man who had been seated at the writing-table rose to his feet. He was
dark, tall, his figure was slim, even elegant, he was well and carefully
dressed although in markedly foreign fashion. His grey eyes had a peculiarly
chilling effect. The smile upon his lips, however, was a perfectly genuine
affair. He appeared to find the situation a little unexpected but amusing.</p>
<p>"Really?" he exclaimed. "Mr. Mildenhall! I was hoping to make your
acquaintance but not quite in this fashion. I am afraid before I ask you to be
seated&mdash;the young lady will excuse me?&mdash;I must ask you, both of you,
please, without any hesitation&mdash;quickly in fact&mdash;to raise your arms
towards the ceiling and keep them there."</p>
<p>Almost before he realized it Charles found himself looking into the barrel
of a revolver held in the speaker's right hand and Blute felt himself covered
by a second weapon held in his left. It was certainly no time for argument.
Charles's first impulsive move forward and the lowering of his right hand had
sent his opponent's finger swiftly and without the slightest hesitation to the
trigger of his weapon. Mildenhall raised his arms in approved fashion. Blute
had already done the same.</p>
<p>"Thank you, gentlemen. Now, will you kindly explain this unexpected
visit?"</p>
<p>"I don't see that any other explanation is necessary than to tell you that
this is my chateau and I am asking you what the devil right you have here,"
Charles replied.</p>
<p>"The right of possession."</p>
<p>"And your name?"</p>
<p>"Ah, you are beginning to be inquisitive," the other observed. "I have
special names for most of the countries I visit and they are many. In
Switzerland I am known nowadays as Count Gervaise Gunther. That is when I am
addressed formally, which rarely happens."</p>
<p>"Of the Three G's!" Blute groaned.</p>
<p>The Count smiled.</p>
<p>"You are a man of the world, I perceive, sir," he remarked, bowing slightly
to the speaker. "You have heard of me."</p>
<p>This was, as he instantly realized, the bitterest moment of Charles
Mildenhall's life. He was conscious of a sensation which produced in him a
feeling of deadly sickness. In his own vanity, in his own self-confidence, he
had brought the girl whom he loved and the man with whom he was working into
this mortal danger. He had taken a risk, not only on his own account but for
them also. It was a horrible thought. If ever he passed out of this ghastly
room alive, a possibility which he was inclined to doubt, he would still never
forget the agony of these moments.</p>
<p>"Yes," Blute admitted after a brief pause, "I have heard of you. I sometimes
wondered if the time would ever come when we should meet face to face. I did
not think that it would be here, though, or in this fashion."</p>
<p>"You have brought to a successful conclusion, Mr. Blute," the Count
observed, reseating himself in his chair but keeping the little dark brown gun
with its almost violet-coloured barrel in his right hand, "so many of your
schemes in life that I imagine you have forgotten the possibility of failure. I
have been one of your admirers, you know. I always felt that if I could have
come across a man with a genius for finance, as brilliant in his way as I am in
mine, we might have done great things in Europe. We might have become
king-makers. We might even have occupied thrones of our own."</p>
<p>"You flatter me," Blute said bluntly.</p>
<p>"Not in the least. By the by, young lady, will you not honour this poor
abode by taking a chair? It is really more your friend Mr. Mildenhall's than
mine, you know, although I am doing the honours just now. Do sit down. The
small orange-coloured couch behind you would go with your complexion and
hair."</p>
<p>"Thank you. I'll try it," Patricia assented.</p>
<p>The Count smiled in approval.</p>
<p>"I was about to allude, Mr. Blute," he went on, "to the amazing <i>coup</i>
you have brought off which has preserved for Mr. Leopold Benjamin his great
fortune. In nearly every country you have not only preserved his wealth but you
have added to it. You will be proud to know, I am sure, that even in my own
country, Switzerland, your name is as famous even as my own."</p>
<p>"It is an honour," Blute murmured with gentle sarcasm.</p>
<p>"This present enterprise of yours, though, Mr. Blute, seems scarcely likely
to redound so much to your credit," the Count continued. "I am inclined to fear
that you have been a little indiscreet in your choice of an ally."</p>
<p>"That," was the calm reply, "seems to be my affair. If I may be pardoned for
saying so, I am not a young man and I cannot support the weight of my two arms
held in a vertical position very much longer."</p>
<p>"Reasonable," the other acknowledged. "Let me see&mdash;what can we do?
Strauss, this way a moment."</p>
<p>The man who had admitted them came from the shadows of a further apartment.
His master reflected.</p>
<p>"Let me see if this would work," he suggested. "Hold Mr. Blute's right wrist
firmly in your fingers, Strauss, and place your hand upon the muzzle of his
weapon. If he is willing to relinquish it bring it to me."</p>
<p>Blute was not the man to make an effort which was foredoomed to failure. He
yielded the revolver.</p>
<p>"The same course of action with my younger friend, Mr.
Mildenhall...Excellent. Both weapons I will keep on the table by my side,
gentlemen, until we have arrived at an understanding. By the by, Mr.
Mildenhall, we have turned your rackets court temporarily into an execution
ground. We have found it very well adapted for the purpose."</p>
<p>"I shall be happy to sample it," Charles observed grimly.</p>
<p>"It seems to me highly probable," the Count continued, "that you will have
an opportunity. I am not a jealous husband but I do not like young men whose
flirtations with my wife become too obvious. There was that hideous-looking
Hessian lieutenant, for instance, who has probably saved his skin by going off
to Poland. I had no fancy for that young man. Of course, when it comes to the
great ones of the world&mdash;with the same Christian name as your own," he
reflected with a smile, "a husband may regard the affair with greater leniency.
A very charming man, the Archduke."</p>
<p>"Do you know, I don't want to be rude," Charles ventured, "but I'm getting
very bored, and I am sure Mr. Blute is too, with your monologue. What the hell
does all this talk about your wife mean?"</p>
<p>"My wife. I forgot you knew her by her later name, the Baroness von
Ballinstrode. She was really a very pretty young woman years ago when she
became the Countess Gunther."</p>
<p>There was a brief acute silence.</p>
<p>"Are you telling me," Charles demanded, "that Beatrice von Ballinstrode is
your wife?"</p>
<p>The Count sighed.</p>
<p>"Do you mean to tell me that you have never heard of that dear lady's
disreputable connection?"</p>
<p>"I will answer for it that he did not," Blute intervened. "Mr. Mildenhall
knew only that the Baroness had made an unfortunate marriage with a man who
ruined her life and from whom she was divorced."</p>
<p>"Ah, but that is where my wife was wrong," the Count protested calmly. "I
never consented to the divorce. If my wife had been a little more reasonable
she might have been very useful to me. At any rate, I never had any idea of
letting her go. I have not been quite satisfied with her behaviour
lately&mdash;in fact, my displeasure went so far as to relieve her of her
passport&mdash;but..."</p>
<p>"Get on with the matter in hand," Blute insisted.</p>
<p>"I am talking to save time," the Count confided. "I am coming to the point
now, though. In this bungled enterprise of yours, Mr. Blute, what have you done
with the&mdash;er&mdash;loot?"</p>
<p>"It lies at the bottom of the avenue on the left-hand side coming up," Blute
replied without hesitation.</p>
<p>"Right to my door!" Gunther exclaimed with a gesture of gratitude. "Well,
you really are the most accommodating interlopers I ever knew. To realize that
I might have gone to the trouble of bringing all these things down here from
Vienna myself and then very likely made a mess of it&mdash;as you have done! I
really am indebted to you both&mdash;and to the young lady, too," he added with
a little bow.</p>
<p>"Nothing to thank me for," Patricia remarked with a slight yawn. "I have
been rather in the way."</p>
<p>"Fancy, the bottom of the avenue here!" the Count repeated. "Really! We'll
say nothing about the freight but I think that I ought to pay something towards
the Customs. What do you think, Mr. Blute?"</p>
<p>"Go to hell!"</p>
<p>The Count looked at the speaker gravely.</p>
<p>"Mr. Blute," he remonstrated, "there is a young lady present. However, as it
seems to irritate you I will make no more comments upon this dismal failure of
yours. Under the circumstances perhaps it was to be expected. There is one
question, however, I would like to ask. What has become of the guard you
brought with you whose instructions were to remain with the caskets in the
luggage van?"</p>
<p>"They are still guarding our property," Blute replied. "They will go on
doing that, you know, for the present."</p>
<p>"I judged that they might be," the other observed. "To tell you the truth,
when Mr. Mildenhall complained just now of what he called my monologue I was
perfectly truthful in my reply. I was talking to save time. It occurred to me
that if those four men of yours were to march up here I should have been
obliged to get rid of you two in order to have made our numbers a little more
even."</p>
<p>"How should you have got rid of us?" Patricia asked.</p>
<p>"I should have left you out of the affair entirely, young lady," he assured
her. "I have a great fancy for red hair and those queer greenish eyes that go
with it sometimes. I admire a slim figure, too. That is why I could not get on
so well with my own wife lately. She is just a little too much inclined to put
on flesh. Don't you think so, Mr. Mildenhall? Ah, I see you agree with me. You,
young lady, as I was saying, I should reserve for a different fate, as they say
in the pictures, but I should have been compelled to take Mr. Mildenhall and
Mr. Blute up to the&mdash;er&mdash;rackets court. Sounds better than execution
ground."</p>
<p>"I'd rather go with them than listen to you talk," she declared boldly. "I
think that you are a most annoying person. Couldn't they have done something
about it while you were young?"</p>
<p>"My mother and father," he assured her, "loved to listen to my childish
prattle. However&mdash;finished. I've gained all the time I wanted. I am going
to shoot you two&mdash;you, Blute, because you have already cut into one or two
of my little affairs and I'm getting tired of it. If it hadn't been for a
stroke of good luck you'd have spoilt this one for me&mdash;and that would have
meant," he went on, leaning forward, "something like four million pounds. The
Leopold Benjamin collection is worth quite that."</p>
<p>"I believe it is," Blute agreed.</p>
<p>"Well, you say you have four men guarding it down there. Now, I have eleven
men who will hurry back here when they find that I am not at the rendezvous
because they will know that I have taken this little affair over and they will
want to know where the treasure is. In a very few minutes they will no doubt be
here. They will fight it out with your four brave warriors. What do you say, my
divinity with the red hair? Will you come up with me to the tower and look out
through my telescope and watch the Struggle or will you come and watch a little
diversion on the rackets court first?"</p>
<p>"I would go anywhere for the pleasure of seeing you shot!" she retorted.</p>
<p>"Bad manners," he sighed.</p>
<p>"In any case, if ever you laid a finger on me," she assured him, "I would
shoot you before you did so if I could, but I would shoot you afterwards if I
had to wait a dozen years. That's my red hair, you see. Bad temper it
means."</p>
<p>Her inquisitor smiled. It was one of the most unpleasant smiles that ever
parted a man's lips.</p>
<p>"I foresee that there might be difficulties in my original scheme," he
remarked. "Strauss, move those two revolvers I have left upon the table. We are
excellently placed here. Unless I am very much mistaken the diversion down
below is about to commence."</p>
<p>Charles suddenly caught up the chair by his side and held it over his
head.</p>
<p>"I've had enough of this! Get out of the way, Patricia. Let the fellow
shoot."</p>
<p>He smashed the window in front of them into a dozen pieces. He was poised
for the spring through what was left of it when Patricia's shriek rang through
the room.</p>
<p>"Stop, Charles!" she cried. "These aren't his men at all!"</p>
<p>A lorry had turned in at the bottom of the drive and was being driven
furiously towards the chateau. It was packed with soldiers in an unfamiliar
uniform. Behind was another and smaller car, and then a limousine. The Count
stood like a man turned to stone. He watched the approaching cavalcade with
blank amazement. His upraised hand which had been clutching the revolver fell
to his side. Patricia made a lightning-like dash at the weapon and snatched it
from his loosened fingers. She tossed it across to Charles.</p>
<p>"Catch!" she cried.</p>
<p>Charles caught it.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-27" id="ch-27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<p>The actual moments that passed before the door was flung open must have been
almost negligible, yet to Patricia they seemed interminable. To the man who
stood now covered by his own revolver they might have been a lifetime. There
was no doubt but that it was not so much cowardice as blank and complete
astonishment which robbed him temporarily of the power of speech or movement.
He only recovered himself when he heard the babel of voices in the hall and
found the room invaded. An officer in field-grey uniform crossed the threshold.
A sergeant and a dozen privates pressed after him. Then for the first time the
Count found his voice.</p>
<p>"Who the mischief are you?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"Major Huber&mdash;Swiss Infantry," was the prompt reply. "Arrest that man,
sergeant!"</p>
<p>The sergeant and two privates seized hold of the Count just a little too
late. He was recovering himself. He sent the first private sprawling. His place
was taken by another, however. All the time Charles's gun was perfectly
steady.</p>
<p>"I can shoot him if you give the word," he declared.</p>
<p>"So could I," the officer, who had withdrawn his revolver from its holster,
replied. "My job is to arrest him, though."</p>
<p>The Count was himself again but a few seconds too late. The first private
was still on the floor, the sergeant, who had staggered back after a fierce
blow on the cheek, had recovered himself and was holding his prisoner's arm.
Two other privates obeyed the word of command. At least a half-dozen men had
their grip upon him. He ceased to struggle.</p>
<p>"What is the charge. Major?" he asked.</p>
<p>The officer turned towards the entrance. He made a sign to the man who was
standing on duty there. The door was flung open. Beatrice von Ballinstrode,
with a soldier on either side, entered.</p>
<p>"Baroness," the Major said, "are you able to identify this man?"</p>
<p>She advanced into the full light of the room. Charles very nearly dropped
his revolver. She was probably the calmest person there. She looked him in the
face, then turned back to the Major.</p>
<p>"Certainly," she answered. "I was unfortunately married to him eighteen
years ago under the name of Schrafft&mdash;Paul Schrafft."</p>
<p>"You are positively able to identify him, Baroness?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely," she said.</p>
<p>"The charge is, then," the Major said, "that you have been for fifteen
years, Paul Schrafft, a deserter from the Swiss Army. Have you anything to say
about that?"</p>
<p>"It is you who identify me?" he asked, looking across the room at
Beatrice.</p>
<p>"It is I. Do you know why I do it? I see that you do. Major, I spent the
night at a little village not far from here at the chateau of my cousins. This
man here, still my husband, I suppose, sent one of his company of thieves all
the way there to steal my passport. He was afraid that it was my intention to
interfere in a little business he was engaged upon. He was quite right, but I
arrived here all the same and, I should imagine," she continued, her eyes
sweeping the room, "just in time."</p>
<p>The Major saluted.</p>
<p>"We are obliged. Baroness," he said.</p>
<p>"Is my presence required further?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Certainly not. Sergeant, you may remove the prisoner. Allow me to see you
to your car. Baroness. Which of you gentlemen is Mr. Mildenhall?"</p>
<p>Charles stepped forward.</p>
<p>"I'm here."</p>
<p>The Major smiled.</p>
<p>"I shall be returning directly," he said, "for the favour of a few minutes'
conversation with you."</p>
<p>There was a tramping of feet. In a moment or two the room was empty except
for Patricia, Blute and Charles. Marius Blute was smoothing his hair before a
mirror after a hurried glance down the avenue. Patricia had thrown herself into
a chair. Her own hair was in wild disorder and she had torn her skirt in the
convulsive leap forward when she had snatched the revolver from the arrested
man. Charles was on his knees by her side. Nevertheless, although she was very
pale, her eyes were open and she forced a smile as she felt the pressure of his
fingers.</p>
<p>"If I could have some water," she murmured.</p>
<p>"Look round the room&mdash;there's a good fellow," Charles asked Blute.</p>
<p>The latter looked round the room in vain, then he stepped out into the hall.
He returned, followed by a chauffeur and a plump lady dressed in black. Charles
welcomed them gladly.</p>
<p>"That's you, is it. Holmes?" he exclaimed. "Thank heavens! And you, Madame
Renouf!"</p>
<p>"We're here, sir," the chauffeur said, "but it's been a funny business!"</p>
<p>"It has indeed," Madame Renouf assented. "Allow me, sir."</p>
<p>She poured some water from the carafe which she was carrying into a
tumbler.</p>
<p>"The poor young lady," she murmured sympathetically. "She's had a nasty
shock and no mistake."</p>
<p>"I shall be all right in a minute," Patricia declared.</p>
<p>"Tim's gone, sir," the chauffeur announced gloomily. "He smelt a rat, Tim
did, and he let on to the Count. The Count shot him down just as you or I would
brush away a fly. Thank God he's off the premises, sir. He came here and said
he'd leased the chateau from you for six months. If it hadn't been your own
voice I heard on the phone last night, sir, I should have been off to-night.
They made me answer the phone and wouldn't let me say a word on my own."</p>
<p>"Plane all right?" Charles asked.</p>
<p>"Going like a humming bird, sir."</p>
<p>"Johnson there? That's his name, isn't it? The pilot."</p>
<p>"He's around all right, sir, but again he isn't, so to speak. The Count told
him he might want the plane this morning. Never said a word about your coming.
Johnson's off in hiding, he is, but I can put my hand on him in a minute."</p>
<p>Patricia sat up.</p>
<p>"I'm absolutely all right," she announced. "Charles, do you realize what has
happened?"</p>
<p>She threw her arms round his neck. The housekeeper glanced discreetly
away.</p>
<p>"And me, I think," Mr. Blute suggested.</p>
<p>Patricia embraced him without hesitation.</p>
<p>"That," he remarked as he withdrew himself a little awkwardly, "is the first
time I have kissed a lady for twelve years."</p>
<p>"It's been worth while waiting, hasn't it, dear?" she laughed.</p>
<p>"Don't you try your tricks on me!" he warned her. "Remember, you're as good
as a married woman!"</p>
<p>"There is nothing that could go wrong, now, is there?" she asked, a great
relief shining out of her eyes.</p>
<p>Blute escorted her to the window.</p>
<p>"Our four guards are there smoking cigarettes and guarding the treasure. The
Count is seated in the middle of that lorry which has just passed out through
the gate, two soldiers either side of him and two behind. I never thought I'd
see the end of the Three G's crowd. Whichever way our plans lie now we are safe
and when opportunity arises I shall most certainly drink the health of that
brave lady who has got us out of this mess."</p>
<p>"We are returning to earth again," Charles said.</p>
<p>"It's a mercy, sir," the housekeeper declared, "because I'm hoping you'll
fancy some luncheon, even if it is late."</p>
<p>There was a squeal from Patricia, various other sounds of approbation from
Blute and Charles.</p>
<p>"The Count's been sort of funny all this morning," Madame Renouf remarked.
"I could never get him to tell me how many to cook for but there's enough for
ten or twelve anyhow and something over if you've men to feed."</p>
<p>"Who's looking after my cellar here?" Charles asked.</p>
<p>"Mr. Needham's been doing it until the last few days, sir," she declared.
"He felt like I did about the Count and he refused to give up the keys. There
was a sort of scramble and Needham didn't get the best of it. He'd have liked
to have got away, but this place has been like one of them fortresses, sir.
There have been men watching at every door. You weren't very fond of strangers
in your day, Mr. Mildenhall, sir," she remarked, "but the Count, he was a lot
worse."</p>
<p>"What I want to know now," Charles said patiently, "is&mdash;where are the
cellar keys?"</p>
<p>"I have them here, sir," she announced, producing them. "I made that other
man&mdash;the Count's valet, he was really&mdash;hand them over every night.
I've a couple of maids in the kitchen. They weren't in with the rough lot at
all&mdash;they're Swiss girls I found myself. They can be getting on with the
luncheon and you'd better let me be seeing what there is I can bring you up
from the cellar. I know where everything is. I'm thinking it's a cocktail that
the young lady and you gentlemen will be wanting&mdash;and no wonder with the
morning you've been through."</p>
<p>"I'd come with you, Madame Renouf," Charles declared, "but I want to speak
to the Major before he slips away. Bring us up vermouth, gin, Cointreau,
lemons, champagne and white wine&mdash;all you can carry."</p>
<p>"There's a cellar boy with a wine basket," she confided. "The Count was a
terrible man but he knew the way the gentry did things. We're all very curious
down below but I'll be asking questions a little later on."</p>
<p>"And ice, Madame Renouf," Charles called out.</p>
<p>The housekeeper looked round in mild reproof.</p>
<p>"As though I'd be forgetting such a thing!" she exclaimed reproachfully.
"I'll go and see Mr. Need-ham at once. He'll perhaps be able to look after you
now he knows the others have gone. In three-quarters of an hour's time, sir, I
shall be able to serve lunch and if those are your men in the park, sir, with
the luggage, they can come in and have a bite in the servants' hall when
they've a mind for it."</p>
<p>"What a heavenly person!" Patricia breathed as Madame Renouf left the
room.</p>
<p>"She's a character," Charles grinned. "She comes from Geneva and is really
more French than Swiss. My head seems to be going round still," he went on
after a moment's pause, "I'll never forget the shock when that fellow Strauss
met us in the hall. I felt there was something wrong."</p>
<p>Blute lit a cigarette. Charles rose to his feet.</p>
<p>"Patricia," he said, "I think I ought to go and speak to the Baroness."</p>
<p>"I should think so," the girl declared. "Charles, she was absolutely
splendid. She faced that man, who looked as though he was dying to kill her,
like a lioness, and what pleased me most was that she never even attempted to
make eyes at you!"</p>
<p>The Major made his appearance. Charles went forward to meet him.</p>
<p>"Major," he said, "I hope you're not in a hurry. You'll stay and have lunch
with us?"</p>
<p>"That's very kind of you. Are you sure it won't be inconvenient?"</p>
<p>"Not in the least," Charles assured him. "This prize criminal you've laid by
the heels seems to have kept most of my staff. My housekeeper tells me that
luncheon for as many people as we like will be ready in three-quarters of an
hour. That should give us almost time enough to drink as many cocktails as the
occasion demands."</p>
<p>The Major smiled.</p>
<p>"Ah," he exclaimed, "that delightful American and English custom! The
cocktails&mdash;yes. Delightful."</p>
<p>Needham and the chauffeur appeared with a tray and the cellar boy with the
bottles. One of the maids brought glasses and the ice.</p>
<p>"I'll make the cocktails," Patricia decided, jumping down. "Forgive my
skirt&mdash;I'll mend it afterwards."</p>
<p>"One moment," Charles said. "Major, I must present you to my
fiancee&mdash;Mademoiselle Grey. If you were an Englishman and played cricket
you would know what I mean when I say that she has just made the most wonderful
throw-in I ever saw."</p>
<p>"You were pretty nippy with the catch," Blute observed.</p>
<p>"We were in a hole here," Charles admitted. "We walked in expecting nothing
of this sort and I suppose we were a little foolish, but anyhow the Count got
our revolvers. He brought us over to the window to see a massacre. He was
holding his weapon all the time and I think he'd made up his mind to shoot me.
He saw the lorry full of soldiers turning in at the gate and for a moment he
relaxed. Miss Grey gave one jump, snatched his revolver from his fingers while
he was staring out of the window and threw it over to me. We haven't had time
to say a word about it yet and however long we live I don't suppose we shall
ever forget it. I've been in a few tight corners in my time but I shall never
forget this one."</p>
<p>"If you are Major Mildenhall of the British Intelligence, sir," the Major
declared, "you certainly have. We knew all about your having this chateau
unofficially, but of course we couldn't approach you in any way."</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm Mildenhall, but I should have been a dead Mildenhall instead of a
live one if it hadn't been for this girl," Charles confided as he escorted her
to the table. "I'll hand you the bottles, Patricia, and you do the mixing.
Heavens, what a gorgeous shaker! I don't think that belongs to the house."</p>
<p>These Three G's men understood the niceties of life, anyhow."</p>
<p>"What marvellous lemons!" Patricia exclaimed. "Charles, I think it will have
to be White Ladies, the lemons look so good."</p>
<p>It was a very cheerful little cocktail party. Afterwards the Major drew
Charles on one side.</p>
<p>"I know so little of what has occurred yet," he confessed, "that you must
forgive me if I make a <i>faux pas</i>, but I speak for a moment, with your
permission, of the Baroness von Balhnstrode, that poor woman who was deceived
into marrying Paul Schrafft&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I was on my way out to talk to her when you entered," Charles interrupted,
feeling a sudden qualm. "I feel rather ashamed that she would have left without
a single word."</p>
<p>"My dear fellow," the Major said earnestly, "she wished it. She was
perfectly honest but her one idea was to get away. She was in a highly
emotional state, she had braced herself for a great effort. I thought she
played her part magnificently. She wishes to drop right out of everything. I
have given her a card to the <i>Chef de la Gare</i> at Z&uuml;rich and also a
note on the back of one of my cards to the passport authorities. She will be
perfectly all right now. There was not a thing she wanted but to get away. She
had everything necessary for the voyage, plenty of money, Letter of Credit,
everything. She will probably catch the last train that runs into Monte Carlo
and there she assures me that she will find one of her oldest friends. If I say
one thing you will not think it an impertinence?"</p>
<p>"How could I?" Charles protested.</p>
<p>"She did not want to see you again. There, I do not mind telling you that.
Major Mildenhall, because you know which way to take it. I felt a lump in my
throat when she found the words to tell me not to let you come out. You see, I
am a man of sentiment. I understood."</p>
<p>He held out his hand. Mildenhall gripped it warmly. They all clamoured for
another cocktail. The Major raised his glass.</p>
<p>"To a brave woman!" he said softly.</p>
<p>They drank the toast in rapt silence. They put down their glasses empty. The
door was opened. They seemed suddenly transported into another country.
Needham, the typical grey-haired English butler, stood upon the threshold.</p>
<p>"Luncheon is served, sir," he announced.</p>
<p>Charles put his arm round Patricia's waist and led her towards the
dining-room.</p>
<p>"Had a pretty rough time, I'm afraid, Needham," he remarked, pausing for a
moment to shake hands with his servant.</p>
<p>"An exceedingly uncomfortable period of great anxiety, sir," the man
admitted. "Will you drink white wine or red, sir, with your luncheon?"</p>
<p>"The white wine to start with and then champagne."</p>
<p>"It is indeed a festival day," the Major, who loved champagne, declared as
he unfolded his napkin.<br>
<br></p>
<p>Fortunately for the plans of the host the Major was obliged to be back in
barracks at three o'clock. Immediately after his departure Blute drew his two
young companions back into the reception room.</p>
<p>"My young friends," he said, "I have a proposition to make to you. Thanks to
our host's marvellous telephone service I have already received the best of
news. Mr. Benjamin is at Meurice's hotel in Paris. He is in the best of health,
his wife is with him and also one daughter. I shall never forget his amazement
at hearing my voice. The situation is exactly as I feared with regard to our
correspondence. Not one line has he received from me. One hundred
communications of various sorts has his secretary addressed to me. The main
line is still open to Paris. I with my guards and baggage propose to leave at
five o'clock. With regard to Miss Grey, Mr. Benjamin desired me to say that no
one in the world would be more welcome if she chose to accompany me. He wished
me to add that her post awaits her and that her salary has accumulated. I told
him that I believed she had found a more suitable engagement."</p>
<p>"Excellent!" Charles declared. "There really is nothing more that either I
or Miss Grey could do for you?"</p>
<p>"Not a thing," Blute assured them. "I have a message from Mr. Benjamin for
you, Mr. Mildenhall, and also for you. Miss Grey. It is a message, he says, too
precious to be sent over the telephone. War or no war he demands that with the
utmost expedition possible you spend the last few days of your honeymoon with
him at Meurice's."</p>
<p>"Nothing would suit us better," Charles acquiesced. "Your plan is admirable,
Blute. What I want to do, and I hope Patricia will agree, is to fly to England
to-day."</p>
<p>"To England to-day?" she gasped.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>"You only want your dressing-bag. I have loads of sisters and cousins who
will cart you round to do trousseau-buying but I warn you, you won't have much
time for that sort of thing. It's a special licence for us to-morrow. A week in
England&mdash;half of it at the Foreign Office, I'm afraid&mdash;and all being
well, Mr. Blute, you can tell Mr. Benjamin that we'll be at Meurice's in ten
days. Then we shall have a week's more honeymoon and I must settle down into
whatever war job they give me. Is that all right, Patricia?"</p>
<p>She clung to his arm.</p>
<p>"It sounds like heaven, dear. But there's just one thing&mdash;shall I have
time to mend my frock or must I mend it in the plane?"</p>
<p>"I should like to start," he told her, "in half-an-hour."</p>
<p>"Then I'll mend my frock in the plane," she decided.</p>
<p>"And," he went on, "as I should like to take a tolerably clean girl into
England may I remind you, young lady, that I carried your dressing-case all the
way up the hill and Madame Renouf has put it in one of the rooms that hasn't
been used. It has a bathroom and she will provide a maid to help you. You have
exactly half-an-hour from now."</p>
<p>She was gone like a flash.</p>
<p>"Quickest thing on her feet I've ever seen," Blute remarked, as he watched
her admiringly. "I'm not much for the other sex myself, Mr. Mildenhall, but I
think you're to be envied."</p>
<p>The two men shook hands warmly.</p>
<p>"And so is she," Blute declared. "I can't say I've known many Englishmen,
Mr. Mildenhall, but you're&mdash;well, you're all right. I shall be always glad
I've known you."</p>
<p>"And I've just one thing to say to you in reply, Blute," Charles said with
his hand on the other's shoulder. "You never said a word when I nearly let you
down, you never even looked what you must have felt. That was the action and
the reserve of a great gentleman."</p>
<p>"Ah, well," Blute said, "you knew." Half-an-hour later he watched their
plane pass westwards&mdash;a glittering speck in the sky.</p>
