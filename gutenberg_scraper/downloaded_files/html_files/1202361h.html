<h2><a name="preface" id="preface"></a>PREFACE</h2>
<p><b>THE</b> scientific results of the expedition cannot be
stated in detail in this book. The expert members in each branch
have contributed to the appendices articles which summarise what
has been done in the domains of geology, biology, magnetism,
meteorology, physics, &amp;c. I will simply indicate here some of
the more important features of the geographical work.</p>
<p>We passed the winter of 1908 in McMurdo Sound, twenty miles
north of the <i>Discovery</i> winter quarters. In the autumn a
party ascended Mount Erebus and surveyed its various craters. In
the spring and summer of 1908-9 three sledging-parties left
winter quarters; one went south and attained the most southerly
latitude ever reached by man, another reached the South Magnetic
Pole for the first time, and a third surveyed the mountain ranges
west of McMurdo Sound.</p>
<p>The southern sledge-journey planted the Union Jack in latitude
88&deg; 23' South, within one hundred geographical miles of the South
Pole. This party of four ascertained that a great chain of
mountains extends from the 82nd parallel, south of McMurdo Sound,
to the 86th parallel, trending in a south-easterly direction;
that other great mountain ranges continue to the south and
south-west, and that between them flows one of the largest
glaciers in the world, leading to an inland plateau, the height
of which, at latitude 88&deg; South, is over 11,000 ft. above
sea-level. This plateau presumably continues beyond the
geographical South Pole, and extends from Cape Adare to the Pole.
The bearings and angles of the new southern mountains and of the
great glacier are shown on the chart, and are as nearly correct
as can be expected in view of the somewhat rough methods
necessarily employed in making the survey.</p>
<p>The mystery of the Great Ice Barrier has not been solved, and
it would seem that the question of its formation and extent
cannot be determined definitely until an expedition traces the
line of the mountains round its southerly edge. A certain amount
of light has been thrown on the construction of the Barrier, in
that we were able, from observations and measurements, to
conclude provisionally that it is composed mainly of snow. The
disappearance of Balloon Bight, owing to the breaking away of a
section of the Great Ice Barrier, shows that the Barrier still
continues its recession, which has been observed since the voyage
of Sir James Ross in 1842. There certainly appears to be a high
snow-covered land on the 163rd meridian, where we saw slopes and
peaks, entirely snow-covered, rising to a height of 800 ft., but
we did not see any bare rocks, and did not have an opportunity to
take soundings at this spot. We could not arrive at any definite
conclusion on the point.</p>
<p>The journey made by the Northern Party resulted in the
attainment of the South Magnetic Pole, the position of which was
fixed, by observations made on the spot and in the neighbourhood,
at latitude 72&deg; 25' South, longitude 155&deg; 16' East. The first
part of this journey was made along the coastline of Victoria
Land, and many new peaks, glaciers and ice-tongues were
discovered, in addition to a couple of small islands. The whole
of the coast traversed was carefully triangulated, and the
existing map was corrected in several respects.</p>
<p>The survey of the western mountains by the Western Party added
to the information of the topographical details of that part of
Victoria Land, and threw some new light on its geology.</p>
<p>The discovery of forty-five miles of new coastline extending
from Cape North, first in a south-westerly and then in a westerly
direction, was another important piece of geographical work.</p>
<p>During the homeward voyage of the <i>Nimrod</i> a careful
search strengthened that prevalent idea that Emerald Island, the
Nimrod Islands and Dougherty Island do not exist, but I would not
advise their removal from the chart without further
investigation. There is a remote possibility that they lie at
some point in the neighbourhood of their charted positions, and
it is safer to have them charted until their non-existence has
been proved absolutely.</p>
<p>I should like to tender my warmest thanks to those generous
people who supported the expedition in its early days. Miss
Dawson Lambton and Miss E. Dawson Lambton made possible the first
steps towards the organisation of the expedition, and assisted
afterwards in every way that lay in their power. Mr. William
Beardmore (Parkhead, Glasgow), Mr. G. A. McLean Buckley (New
Zealand), Mr. Campbell McKellar (London), Mr. Sydney Lysaght
(Somerset), Mr. A. M. Fry (Bristol), Colonel Alexander Davis
(London), Mr. William Bell (Pendell Court, Surrey), Mr. H. H.
Bartlett (London), and other friends contributed liberally
towards the cost of the expedition. I wish also to thank the
people who guaranteed a large part of the necessary expenditure,
and the Imperial Government for the grant of &pound;20,000, which
enabled me to redeem these guarantees. Sir James Mills, managing
director of the Union Steam Shipping Company of New Zealand, gave
very valuable assistance. The kindness and generosity of the
Governments and people of Australia and New Zealand will remain
one of the happiest memories of the expedition.</p>
<p>I am also indebted to the firms which presented supplies of
various sorts, and to the manufacturers who so readily assisted
in the matter of ensuring the highest quality and purity in our
foods.</p>
<p>As regards the production of this book, I am indebted to Dr.
Hugh Robert Mill for the introduction which he has written; to
Mr. Edward Saunders, of New Zealand, who not only acted as my
secretary in the writing of the book, but bore a great deal of
the labour, advised me on literary points and gave general
assistance that was invaluable; and to my publisher, Mr. William
Heinemann, for much help and many kindnesses.</p>
<p>I have to thank the members of the expedition who have
provided the scientific appendices. I should like to make special
mention of Professor T. W. Edgeworth David, who has told the
story of the Northern Journey, and Mr. George Marston, the artist
of the expedition, represented in this volume by the colour
plates, sketches and some diagrams.</p>
<p>I have drawn on the diaries of various members of the
expedition to supply information regarding events that occurred
while I was absent on journeys. The photographs with which these
volumes are illustrated have been selected from some thousands
taken by Brocklehurst, David, Davis, Day, Dunlop, Harbord, Joyce,
Mackintosh, Marshall, Mawson, Murray and Wild, secured often
under circumstances of exceptional difficulty.</p>
<p>In regard to the management of the affairs of the expedition
during my absence in the Antarctic, I would like to acknowledge
the work done for me by my brother-in-law, Mr. Herbert Dorman, of
London; by Mr. J. J. Kinsey, of Christchurch, New Zealand; and by
Mr. Alfred Reid, the manager of the expedition, whose work
throughout has been as arduous as it has been efficient.</p>
<p>Finally, let me say that to the members of the expedition,
whose work and enthusiasm have been the means of securing the
measure of success recorded in these pages, I owe a debt of
gratitude that I can hardly find words to express. I realise very
fully that without their faithful service and loyal co-operation
under conditions of extreme difficulty success in any branch of
our work would have been impossible.</p>

<h3><a name="intro" id="intro"></a>INTRODUCTION<br>
SOUTH POLAR EXPLORATION IN THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS<br>
By HUGH ROBERT MILL, D.Sc., LL.D.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><b>AN</b> outline of the history of recent Antarctic
exploration is necessary before the reader can appreciate to the
full the many points of originality in the equipment of the
expedition of 1907-1909, and follow the unequalled advance made
by that expedition into the slowly dwindling blank of the unknown
South Polar area.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the sixteenth century it was generally
believed that a great continent, equal in area to all the rest of
the land of the globe, lay around the South Pole, stretching
northward in each of the great oceans far into the tropics. The
second voyage of Captain James Cook in 1773-75 showed that if any
continent existed it must lie mainly within the Antarctic Circle,
which he penetrated at three points in search of the land, and it
could be of no possible value for settlement or trade. He reached
his farthest south in 71&deg; 10' South, 1130 miles from the South
Pole.</p>
<p>In 1819 Alexander I, Emperor of all the Russias, resolved of
his good pleasure to explore the North Polar and the South Polar
regions simultaneously and sent out two ships to each
destination. The southern expedition consisted of the two ships
<i>Vostok</i> and <i>Mirni</i>, under the command of Captain
Fabian von Bellingshausen, with Lieutenant Lazareff as second in
command. They made a circumnavigation of the world in a high
southern latitude, supplementing the voyage of Cook by keeping
south where he went north, but not attempting to reach any higher
latitudes. On leaving Sydney in November 1820, Bellingshausen
went south in 163&deg; East, a section of the Antarctic which Cook
had avoided, and from the eagerness with which the Russian
captain apologised for not pushing into the pack it may be
inferred that he found the gate leading to Ross Sea only barred
by the ice, not absolutely locked. The ships went on in the
direction of Cape Horn in order to visit the South Shetlands,
recently discovered by William Smith. On the way Bellingshausen
discovered the first land yet known within the Antarctic Circle,
the little Peter I Island and the much larger Alexander I Land,
which he sighted from a distance estimated at forty miles. A
fleet of American sealers was found at work round the South
Shetlands and some of the skippers had doubtless done much
exploring on their own account, though they kept it quiet for
fear of arousing competition in their trade. Bellingshausen
returned to Cronstadt in 1821 with a loss of only three men in
his long and trying voyage. No particulars of this expedition
were published for many years.</p>
<p>In February 1823, James Weddell, a retired Master in the Royal
Navy, and part owner of the brig <i>Jane</i> of Leith, 160 tons,
was sealing round the South Orkneys with the cutter
<i>Beaufoy</i>, 65 tons, under the command of Matthew Brisbane,
in company, when he decided to push south as far as the ice
allowed in search of new land where seals might be found. Signs
of land were seen in the form of icebergs stained with earth, but
Weddell sailed through a perfectly clear sea, now named after
him, to 74&deg; 15' South in 34&deg; 17' West. This point, reached on
February 22, 1823, was 3&deg; South of Cook's farthest and 945 miles
from the South Pole. On his return he brought back to Europe the
first specimen of the Weddell seal to be seen by any
naturalist.</p>
<p>Enderby Brothers, a firm of London shipowners doing a large
trade in seal-oil, took a keen interest in discovery, and one of
the brothers was an original Fellow of the Royal Geographical
Society, founded in 1830. In that very year the firm despatched
John Biscoe, a retired Master in the Royal Navy, in the brig
<i>Tula</i>, with the cutter <i>Lively</i> in company, on a two
years' voyage, combining exploration with sealing. Biscoe was a
man of the type of Cook and Weddell, a first-class navigator,
indifferent to comfort, ignorant of fear and keen on exploring
the Far South. In January 1831 he commenced a circumnavigation of
the Antarctic Regions eastward from the South Atlantic in 60&deg;
South. At the meridian of Greenwich he got south of the Circle
and pushed on, beating against contrary winds close to the
impenetrable pack which blocked advance to the south. At the end
of February he sighted a coastline in 49&deg; 18' East and about 66&deg;
South, which has since been called Enderby Land, but it has never
been revisited. He searched in vain for the Nimrod Islands, which
had been reported in 56&deg; South, 158&deg; West, and then, crossing the
Pacific Ocean well south of the sixtieth parallel, he, ignorant
of Bellingshausen's voyage, entered Bellingshausen Sea, and
discovered the Biscoe Islands and the coast of Graham Land. On
his return in 1833 Biscoe received the second gold medal awarded
by the Royal Geographical Society for his discoveries and for his
pertinacity in sailing for nearly fifty degrees of longitude
south of the Antarctic Circle.</p>
<p>In 1838 the Enderbys sent out John Balleny in the sealing
schooner <i>Eliza Scott</i>, 154 tons, with the cutter
<i>Sabrina</i>, 54 tons, and he left Campbell Island, south of
New Zealand, on January 17, 1839, to look for new land in the
south. On the 29th he reached the Antarctic Circle in 178&deg; East,
and got to 69&deg; South before meeting with heavy ice. Turning
westward at this point he discovered the group of lofty volcanic
islands which bears his name, and there was no mistake as to
their existence, as one of the peaks rose to a height of 14,000
ft. An excellent sketch was made of the islands by the mate, and
geological specimens were collected from the beach. Proceeding
westward Biscoe reported an "appearance of land in 65&deg; South, and
about 121&deg; East", which Mr. Charles Enderby claimed as a
discovery and called Sabrina Land after the unfortunate cutter,
which was lost with all hands in a gale.</p>
<p>The years 1838 to 1848 saw no fewer than ten vessels bound on
exploration to the ice-cumbered waters of the Antarctic, all
ostensibly bent on scientific research, but all animated, some
admittedly, by the patriotic ambition of each commander to uphold
the honour of his flag.</p>
<p>Captain Dumont d'Urville, of the French Navy, was one of the
founders of the Paris Geographical Society. He had been sent out
on two scientific voyages of circumnavigation, which lasted from
1822 to 1825, and from 1826 to 1829, and he became a great
authority on the ethnology of the Pacific Islands. He planned a
third cruise to investigate problems connected with his special
studies; but, in granting the vessels for this expedition, King
Louis Philippe added to the commission, possibly at the
suggestion of Humboldt, a cruise to the Antarctic regions in
order to out-distance Weddell's farthest south. It was known that
an American expedition was on the point of starting with this end
in view, and that active steps were also being taken in England
to revive southern exploration. Dumont d'Urville got away first
with two corvettes, the <i>Astrolabe</i>, under his command, and
the <i>Zel&eacute;e</i>, under Captain Jacquinot, which sailed from
Toulon on September 7, 1887. The two ships reached the pack-ice
on January 22, 1838, but were unable to do more than sail to and
fro along its edge until February 27, when land was sighted in
63&deg; South and named Louis Philippe Land and Joinville Island.
These were, undoubtedly, part of the Palmer Land of the American
sealers, and a continuation of Biscoe's Graham Land. Though he
did not reach the Antarctic Circle, d'Urville had got to the end
of the Antarctic summer and discharged his debt of duty to his
instructions.</p>
<p>It was the avowed intention of the American expedition and of
the British expedition, since fitted out, to find the South
Magnetic Pole, the position of which was believed from the
theoretical investigations of <i>Gauss</i> to be near 66&deg; South
and 146&deg; East. In December 1839, when d'Urville was at Hobart
Town, and the air was full of rumours of these expeditions, he
suddenly made up his mind to exceed his instructions and make a
dash for the South Magnetic Pole for the honour of France. He
left Hobart on January 1, 1840, and on the 21st sighted land on
the Antarctic Circle in longitude 138&deg; E. The weather was
perfect, the icebergs shone and glittered in the sun like fairy
palaces in the streets of a strange southern Venice; only wind
was wanting to move the ships. The snow-covered hills rose to a
height of about 1500 ft. and received the name of Adelie Land,
after Madame Dumont d'Urville. A landing was made on one of a
group of rocky islets lying off the icebound shore, and the ships
then followed the coast westward for two days. In 135&deg; 30' West
bad weather and a northward bend in the ice drove the corvettes
beyond the Circle, and on struggling south again on January 28,
in the lift of a fog, the <i>Astrolabe</i> sighted a brig flying
the American flag, one of Wilkes' squadron. The ships
misunderstood each other's intentions; each intended to salute
and each thought that the other wished to avoid an interview; and
they parted in the fog full of bitterness towards each other
without the dip of a flag. All day on the 30th, d'Urville sailed
along a vertical cliff of ice 120 to 130 ft. high, quite flat on
top, with no sign of hills beyond; but sure that so great a mass
of ice could not form except on land he did not hesitate to name
it the Clarie coast, after Madame Jacquinot. On February 1, the
French ships left the Antarctic in longitude 130&deg; West.</p>
<p>An American man of science, Mr. J. N. Reynolds, had gone to
Palmer Land in the early days, and on his return agitated
strongly for a national exploring expedition. An Act of Congress
in 1836 provided for such an f expedition, but there had been
controversies giving rise to ill-feeling, and Mr. Reynolds was
not allowed to join "for the sake of harmony". After one and
another of the naval officers designated to command it had
resigned or declined the post. Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, U.S.N.,
was at last persuaded to take charge of the squadron of six
ill-assorted vessels manned by half-hearted crews. His
instructions were to proceed to Tierra del Fuego with the
sloops-of-war <i>Vincennes</i> and <i>Peacock</i>, the brig
<i>Porpoise</i>, the store-ship <i>Relief</i> and the pilot-boats
<i>Sea Gull</i> and <i>Flying Fish</i>; to leave the larger
vessels and the scientific staff&mdash;which they
carried&mdash;and proceed with the <i>Porpoise</i> and the
tenders "to explore the southern Antarctic to the southward of
Powell's group, and between it and Sandwich Land, following the
track of Weddell as closely as practicable, and endeavouring to
reach a high southern latitude; taking care, however, not to be
obliged to pass the winter there." He was then with all his
squadron to proceed southward and westward as far as Cook's
farthest, or 105&deg; West, and then retire to Valparaiso. After
surveying in the Pacific they were to proceed to Sydney and then
the instructions proceeded: "You will make a second attempt to
penetrate within the Antarctic region, south of Van Diemen's
Land, and as far west as longitude 45&deg; East or to Enderby's Land,
making your rendezvous on your return at Kerguelen's Land." Very
stringent orders, dated August 11, 1838, were given to Wilkes not
to allow any one connected with the expedition to furnish any
other persons "with copies of any journal, charts, plan,
memorandum, specimen, drawing, painting or information"
concerning the objects and proceedings of the expedition or as to
discoveries made. The ships were not fortified for ice
navigation; they were not even in sound seaworthy condition; the
stores were inadequate and of bad quality; the crews and
unhappily some of the officers were disaffected, disliking their
commander, and making things very uncomfortable for him. The
attempt to navigate Weddell Sea proved abortive; on the side of
Bellingshausen Sea one ship reached 68&deg; and another 70&deg; South,
but saw nothing except ice.</p>
<p>At Sydney, Wilkes was most unhappy; his equipment was
criticised with more justice than mercy by his colonial visitors,
and in his narrative he says plainly that he was obliged "to
agree with them that we were unwise to attempt such service in
ordinary cruising vessels; we had been ordered to go and that was
enough: and go we should." And they went. On January 16, 1840,
land was sighted by three of the ships in longitudes about 158&deg;
East, apparently just on or south of the Antarctic Circle. The
ships sailed westwards as best they could along the edge of the
pack; sometimes along the face of a barrier of great ice-cliffs,
ignorant of the fact that Balleny had been there the year before,
but very anxious that they should anticipate any discoveries on
the part of the French squadron then in those waters. On January
19, land was reported on the Antarctic Circle both to the
south-east and to the south-west, Wilkes being then in 154&deg; 30'
East, and its height was estimated at 3000 ft. The ships were
involved all the time in most difficult navigation through
drifting floes and bergs, storms were frequent and fogs made life
a perpetual misery, as it was impossible to see the icebergs
until the ships were almost on them. The <i>Peacock</i>, the
least seaworthy of the squadron, lay helpless in the ice for
three days while the rudder, which had been smashed, was being
repaired on deck, and on January 25 she was patched up enough to
return to Sydney. Wilkes' ship, the <i>Vincennes</i>, got south
of the Circle on January 23, and he hoped to reach the land, but
the way was barred by ice. On the 28th, land appeared very
distinctly in 141&deg; East, but the <i>Vincennes</i> was driven off
by a gale, the sea being extraordinarily encumbered with icebergs
and ice-islands. Two days later land was unquestionably found in
66&deg; 45' South, 140&deg; 2' East, with a depth of thirty fathoms;
there were bare rocks half a mile from the ship, and the hills
beyond rose to 3000 ft.; but the weather was too rough to get
boats out. This was the Adelie Land which d'Urville had lighted
on nine days before. This also is the only point of land reported
by the American expedition, with the very doubtful exception of
Sabrina Land, which has been confirmed by another expedition.
Against the written remonstrance of the surgeons, who said that
longer exposure to the heavy work of ice navigation in the severe
conditions of the weather would increase the sick-list to such an
extent as to endanger the ships, and in spite of the urgent
appeal of a majority of the officers, Wilkes held on to the
westward, reporting land in the neighbourhood of the Antarctic
Circle every day, observing many earth-stained icebergs and
collecting specimens of stones from the floating ice. On February
16, the ice-barrier which Wilkes had been following westward
turned towards the north and over it there was "an appearance of
land" which he called Termination Land. He was in 97&deg; 37' East,
and on the 21st, having failed to get farther west, he rejoiced
the hearts of all on board by turning northwards and making for
Sydney. Ringgold on the <i>Porpoise</i> had thought of running to
the rendezvous in 100&deg; East first, and working his way back to
the eastward with a favouring wind afterwards, and he
accomplished the first part of the programme easily enough, for
the wind helped him, passing and disdaining to salute d'Urville's
ships on the way. He added nothing material to the information
obtained by the <i>Vincennes</i>.</p>
<p>Considering the deplorable conditions against which he had to
contend both in the seas without and the men within his ships,
the voyage of Wilkes was one of the finest pieces of determined
effort on record. He erred in not being critical enough of
appearances of land; and his charts were certainly faulty, as any
charts of land dimly seen through fog were bound to be.
Subsequent explorers have sailed over the positions where Wilkes
showed land between 164&deg; and 154&deg; East, and if the land he saw
there exists, it must be farther south than he supposed. It is
certain that Wilkes saw land farther east, and it seems that he
was as harshly judged by Ross and as unsympathetically treated by
some other explorers and geographers as he was by his own
subordinates.</p>
<p>Sir Edward Sabine and other British physicists had been trying
from 1835 onward to secure the despatch of a British expedition
to study terrestrial magnetism in the Antarctic regions, and
pressure was brought to bear on the Royal Society to take the
initiative but with little effect. An effort by Captain
Washington, the Secretary, to arouse the Royal Geographical
Society early in 1837 also failed. In the following year the
recently founded British Association for the Advancement of
Science memorialised Government on the need for making a series
of simultaneous magnetic observations in all parts of the world,
particularly by means of a special expedition to high southern
latitudes. The Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne, was impressed; he
referred the memorial to the Royal Society, which supported it. A
naval expedition was decided on and rapidly fitted out on the
<i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i>, two vessels of great strength,
designed for firing large bombs from mortars in siege operations,
but clumsy craft to navigate, with bluff bows that made them move
slowly through the water, and sluggish in answering their helms.
The one possible commander was Captain James Clark Ross, a tried
Arctic traveller and an enthusiastic student of magnetism, who
had reached the North Magnetic Pole in 1831, and whose surpassing
fitness for the position had been a potent factor in the minds of
the promoters. Captain Crozier was second in command on board the
<i>Terror</i>, and although all the magnetic and other physical
work was to be done by naval officers, the surgeons were
appointed with regard to their proficiency in geology, botany and
zoology. One of these subsequently took rank amongst the greatest
men of science of the nineteenth century, and in 1909 Sir Joseph
Hooker retains at the age of ninety-two the same interest in
Antarctic exploration which drew him in 1889, as a youth of
twenty-one, to join the Navy, in order to accompany the
expedition. The ships were of 370 and 350 tons respectively, the
whole ship's company of each being seventy-six officers and men,
and they were well provisioned for the period, fresh tinned meats
and vegetables being available. The instructions of the Admiralty
left a good deal of discretion to the commander. He was ordered
to land special parties of magnetic observers at St. Helena, the
Cape of Good Hope and Van Diemen's Land. On the way he was to
proceed south from Kerguelen Land and examine those places where
indications of land had been reported. In the following summer he
was to proceed southward from Tasmania towards the South Magnetic
Pole, which he was to reach if possible, and return to Tasmania.
In the following year he was to attain the highest latitude he
could reach and proceed eastward to fix the position of Graham
Land. The <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i> reached Hobart Town in
August 1840, without doing any Antarctic exploration on the way.
At Hobart, Ross was in constant communication with Sir John
Franklin, the governor of Van Diemen's Land and a great authority
on polar exploration in the north. He heard of d'Urville's and
Wilkes' discoveries and was very angry that others had taken the
track marked out for him. He resolved that he would not, as he
somewhat quaintly put it, "interfere with their discoveries" and
in so doing he allowed the haze of uncertainty to rest over the
region south of the Indian Ocean to this day; but he also
resolved to try to get south on the meridian of 170&deg; East, where
Balleny had found open sea in 69&deg; South; and had it not been for
the previous French and American voyages causing him to change
his plans, Ross might conceivably have missed the great chance of
his lifetime. The expedition left Hobart on November 12, 1840,
sighted the sea ice on December 31, lying along the Antarctic
Circle, and after spending some time searching for the best place
to enter it, on January 5, 1841, ships for the first time in the
southern hemisphere left the open sea and pushed their way of set
purpose into the pack. The vessels having been strengthened after
the manner of the northern whalers to resist pressure and Ross
himself fortified by long experience in Arctic navigation, the
impassable barrier of the earlier explorers had no terrors for
him. The pack which all other visitors to the Antarctic had
viewed as extending right up to some remote and inaccessible land
was found to be a belt about a hundred miles wide, and in four
days the <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i> passed through it into
the open waters of what is now called Ross Sea. The way seemed to
lie open to the magnetic pole when a mountain appeared on the
horizon. Ross called it Mount Sabine, after the originator of the
expedition, and held on until on January 11 he was within a few
miles of the bold mountainous coast of South Victoria Land; in
front of him lay Cape Adare in latitude 71&deg; South, from which one
line of mountains, the Admiralty Range, ran north-west along the
coast to Cape North, another, the peaks of which he named after
the members of the Councils of the Royal Society and the British
Association, ran along the coast to the south. Ross went ashore
on Possession Island on January 12 and took possession of the
first land discovered in the reign of Queen Victoria. The sea
swarmed with whales, in the pursuit of which Ross, probably
mistaking the species, thought that a great trade would spring
up. On the 22nd the latitude of 74&deg; South was passed and the
expedition was soon nearer the Pole than any human being had been
before. A few days later Franklin Island was seen and visited;
but, as at Possession Island, no trace of vegetation was found.
On the morning of January 28, a new mountain emitting volumes of
smoke appeared ahead; it was Mount Erebus, named after the
leading ship, and on High Island, as Ross called the land from
which it sprung, appeared a lesser and extinct volcano, called
Mount Terror after the second vessel. As the ships drew near,
confident of sailing far beyond the 80th parallel, an ice-barrier
appeared similar to that reported by Wilkes on his cruise, but
greater. Vast walls of ice as high as the cliffs of Dover butted
on to the new land at Cape Crozier, its western limit, and formed
an absolute bar to further progress. A range of high land running
south was seen over the barrier and this Ross called the Parry
Mountains; to the west around the shores of an ice-girdled bay
(McMurdo Bay) the land seemed to run continuously with the
continent, and Ross accordingly represented Mount Erebus as being
on the mainland, and the coast as turning abruptly in McMurdo Bay
from its southerly to an easterly direction. The ships cruised
eastward for two hundred and fifty miles parallel with the Great
Barrier, the remarkable nature of which impressed all on board,
as they recognised its uniform flat-topped extension and the vast
height of the perpendicular ice-cliffs in which it terminated,
the height being something like 200 ft. on the average, though at
one point it did not exceed 50 ft. On February 2, the highest
latitude of the trip was reached, 78&deg; 4' South, or 3&deg; 48' beyond
Weddell's farthest on the opposite side of the Antarctic Circle.
Two days later the pack became so dense that progress was stopped
in 167&deg; West. Ross struggled for a week to get farther east and
then turned to look for a harbour on the coast of Victoria Land
in which he might winter. Passing by McMurdo Bay without
examining it closely, he tried to get a landing nearer the
Magnetic Pole, being possessed by a burning ambition to hoist the
flag which he had displayed at the North Magnetic Pole in 1831 at
the South Magnetic Pole in 1841. It was impossible, however, to
get within twelve or fourteen miles of the land on account of the
freezing of the sea locking the pack into a solid mass; it was
too late to turn back and seek a harbour farther south, and after
naming the headland at the base of Mount Melbourne, Cape
Washington, in honour of the zealous Secretary of the Royal
Geographical Society, Ross left the Antarctic regions after
having remained south of the Circle for sixty-three days. On the
way northward he sighted high islands, which were probably part
of the Balleny group, and he sailed across the site of a range of
mountains marked on a chart which Wilkes had given him. Wilkes
afterwards explained that these mountains were not intended to
show one of his discoveries, and an unedifying controversy
ensued, which did credit to neither explorer. Ross returned to
Hobart on April 6, 1841, after the greatest voyage of Antarctic
discovery ever made. Three months later the news reached England,
and the Royal Geographical Society at once awarded the Founder's
Gold Medal to Captain Ross.</p>
<p>On November 23, 1841, the <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i> left
the Bay of Islands, New Zealand, which had been declared a
British possession the year before, to make a new effort to get
south in a longitude about 150&deg; West, so as to approach the Great
Barrier from a point east of that at which they had been stopped
the previous season. The pack was entered about 60&deg; South and
146&deg; West on December 18, and it seemed as if the ships were
never to get through it. The Antarctic Circle was reached on New
Year's Day, 1842, every effort being made to work the ships
through the lanes between the floes. For a time when the wind was
favourable the two ships were lashed on each side of a small floe
of convenient shape and with all sail set they were able to give
it sufficient way to break the lighter ice ahead, using it as a
battering-ram and as a buffer to protect their bows. Ross did
everything to keep up the spirits of the crews, by instituting
sports and keeping up visits between the two ships, as in an
Arctic wintering. A terrific storm on January 18 buffeted the
ships unmercifully, the huge masses of floating ice being hurled
against them in a prodigious swell, and for twenty-four hours the
<i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i> were almost out of control, their
rudders having been smashed by the ice, though the stout timbers
of the hulls held good. On January 26, after being thirty-nine
days in the pack, and boring their way for eight hundred miles
through it, the <i>Erebus</i> and the <i>Terror</i> were only
thirty-nine miles farther south than Cook had been in the
<i>Resolution</i> on the same meridian without entering the ice
at all sixty-eight years before. On February 2 the ships escaped
from the pack in 159&deg; East, but only one degree south of the
Antarctic Circle. The Barrier was not sighted until February 22,
and on the 28th the ships at last got within a mile and a half of
the face of the ice-wall, which was found to be 107 ft. high at
its highest point and the water 290 fathoms deep, in 161&deg; 27'
West and 78&deg; 11' South. This was the highest latitude reached by
Ross, 3&deg; 55' or 235 miles farther south than Weddell's farthest,
and 710 miles from the South Pole. Towards the south-east he saw
that the Barrier surface gradually rose with the appearance of
mountains of great height, but he could not bring himself to
chart this as land, for no sign of bare rock could be seen, and
though he felt that "the presence of land there amounts almost to
a certainty" he would not run the risk of any one in the future
proving that he had been mistaken, and so charted it as an
"appearance of land" only. Any other explorer of that period, or
of this, would have called it land and given it a name without
hesitation, and had Ross only known how to interpret what the
numerous rock specimens he dredged up from the bottom had to tell
him, he could have marked the land with an easy mind.</p>
<p>It was now time to leave the Far South; the work had been
infinitely harder than that of the former season and the result
was disappointing. The coast of Victoria Land was not sighted on
this cruise, and on March 6, 1842, the <i>Erebus</i> and
<i>Terror</i> crossed the Antarctic Circle northward, after
having been sixty-four days within it. Ross Sea was not furrowed
by another keel for more than half a century. Once in open water
the <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i> held an easterly course
through the Southern Ocean south of the Pacific, farther north
than Biscoe, Bellingshausen or Cook, making passage to the
Falkland Islands, by that time a British possession. The greatest
danger of the whole cruise occurred suddenly on this passage when
the two ships came into collision while attempting to weather an
iceberg in a gale and snowstorm during the night; but though for
an hour all gave themselves up for lost they came through, and
they reached Port Louis in the Falklands on April 5, 1842, one
hundred and thirty-seven days out from the Bay of Islands.</p>
<p>Having received authority to spend a third summer in south
polar exploration, Ross sailed from the Falklands on December 17,
1842, intending to survey the coasts discovered by d'Urville and
follow the land south to a high latitude in Weddell Sea; but
though several points on Louis Philippe Land were sighted and
mountains named, there was no open way to the south and it was
not until March 1, 1843, that the Antarctic Circle was reached by
coasting the pack to 12&deg; 20' West. Here a sounding of the vast
depth of 4000 fathoms was obtained, but Dr. W. S. Bruce, with
improved and trustworthy apparatus, found sixty years later that
the real depth at this point was only 2660 fathoms. Ross
proceeded southwards in open water to 71&deg; 30' South, thirty miles
within the ice-pack, but there he was stopped nearly halfway
between the positions reached by Bellingshausen in 1820 and by
Weddell in 1823; and here his Antarctic exploration ended. On his
way to Cape Town, Ross searched for Bouvet Island as
unsuccessfully as Cook, though he passed within a few miles of
it. Ross' first summer in the Antarctic had brought unexpected
and magnificent discoveries, tearing a great gap in the unknown
area, and fortune smiled without interruption on the expedition;
his second summer brought trouble and danger with but a trifling
increase in knowledge, while the third led only to
disappointment. Ross had come triumphantly through a time of
unparalleled stress, his personal initiative animated the whole
expedition and never were honours more nobly won than those which
he received on his return. He was knighted, <i>f&ecirc;ted</i>, and
presented with many gold medals; and he was offered and begged in
the most flattering way to accept the command of the expedition
to explore the North-West Passage in his old ships. The position,
when he declined it, was given to Sir John Franklin.</p>
<p>Immediately after Ross' return a supplementary cruise for
magnetic observations was carried out by Lieutenant T. E. L.
Moore, R.N., who had been mate on the Terror. He sailed from Cape
Town in the hired barque <i>Pagoda</i>, 360 tons, on January 9,
1845, and, after the usual fruitless search for Bouvet Island,
crossed the Antarctic Circle in 30&deg; 45' East, but was stopped by
the ice in 67&deg; 50' South. He struggled hard against calms and
head winds to reach Enderby Land, but in vain. Moore believed
that he saw land in 64&deg; South and about 50&deg; East; but like Ross
he stood on a pedantic technicality, "there was no doubt about
it, but we would not say it was land without having really landed
on it." How much controversy and ill-feeling would have been
avoided if Wilkes and other explorers had acted on this
principle!</p>
<p>In 1850, in one of the Enderbys' ships, the <i>Brisk</i>,
Captain Tapsell went to the Balleny Islands looking for seals and
sailed westward at a higher latitude than Wilkes had reached, as
far as the meridian of 143&deg; East, without sighting land; the log
of the voyage is lost, and the exact route is not on record.</p>
<p>Though Ross urged the value of the southern whale fishery in
strong terms, no one stirred to take it up. Polar enterprise was
diverted to the lands within the Arctic Circle by the tragedy of
Franklin's fate and the search expeditions. Efforts were made
again and again to reawaken interest in the south, notably by the
great American hydrographer, Captain Maury, and the eminent
German meteorologist, Professor Georg von Neumayer, but without
effect.</p>
<p>In 1875, H.M.S. <i>Challenger</i>, on her famous voyage of
scientific investigation with Captain George Nares, R.N., as
commander and Professor Wyville Thomson as scientific director,
made a dash south of Kerguelen Land, and on February 16 she had
the distinction of being the first vessel propelled by steam
across the Antarctic Circle. She went to 66&deg; 40' South in
longitude 78&deg; 22' East, and pushed eastward in a somewhat lower
latitude to within fifteen miles of Wilkes' Termination Land as
shown on the charts, but nothing resembling land could be seen.
The <i>Challenger</i> saw many icebergs, but being an unprotected
vessel and bent on other service she could make no serious
attempt to penetrate the pack; nevertheless, the researches made
on board by sounding and dredging up many specimens of rocks
proved beyond doubt that land lay within the ice surrounding the
Antarctic Circle and that the land was not insular but a
continent.</p>
<p>In the same year a German company sent out the steam whaler
<i>Gr&ouml;nland</i>, Captain Dallmann, to try whether anything could
be made of whaling or sealing in the neighbourhood of the South
Shetlands, and he went probably to about 65&deg; South in
Bellingshausen Sea on the coast of Graham Land. In the 'eighties
of last century Neumayer continued to urge the renewal of
Antarctic research in Germany, and Sir John Murray, raising his
powerful voice in Great Britain, sketched out a scheme for a
fully equipped naval expedition, but refused to have anything to
do with any expedition not provided at the outset with funds
sufficient to ensure success. The government of Victoria took the
matter up and offered to contribute &pound;5000 to an expedition if the
Home Government would support it; the British Association, the
Royal Society, and the Royal Geographical Society reported in
favour of the scheme, but in 1887 the Treasury definitely
declined to participate.</p>
<p>In 1892 a fleet of four Dundee whalers set out for Weddell
Sea, in order to test Ross' belief that the whalebone whale
existed there, and two of them, the <i>Balaena</i> and
<i>Active</i>, were fitted up with nautical and meteorological
instruments by the Royal Geographical Society and the
Meteorological Office, in the hope that they would fix accurate
positions and keep careful records. Dr. W. S. Bruce, an
enthusiastic naturalist, accompanied the <i>Balaena</i> and Dr.
C. W. Donald accompanied the <i>Active</i>, commanded by Captain
Thomas Robertson. The ships made full cargoes of seals in Weddell
Sea, but did not go beyond 65&deg; South, nor did they repeat the
venture. A Norwegian whaler, the <i>Jason</i>, was sent out at
the same time by a company in Hamburg, and her master, Captain
Larsen, picked up a number of fossils on Seymour Island, and saw
land from Weddell Sea in 64&deg; 40' South. The Hamburg Company sent
out three ships in 1893, the <i>Jason</i> to Weddell Sea, where
Captain Larsen discovered Oscar Land, no doubt the eastern coast
of Graham Land, in 66&deg; South and 60&deg; West, and pushing on farther
he discovered Foyn Land, the <i>Jason</i> being the second
steamer to enter the Antarctic regions proper. On his way home
along the coast he charted many new islands and discovered active
volcanoes near the place where Ross' officers had seen smoke
rising from the mountains, though that cautious explorer decided
that as it might be only snowdrift he would not claim the
discovery of volcanoes there. Meanwhile, in Bellingshausen Sea,
Captain Evenson, of the <i>Hertha</i>, got beyond 69&deg; 10' South
after visiting the Biscoe Islands, and he sighted Alexander I
Land for the first time since its discovery.</p>
<p>The next visit to the Antarctic was due to the Norwegian
whaler, Svend Foyn, who sent out the <i>Antarctic</i>, under
Captain Kristensen, with Mr. Bull as agent, to Ross Sea. They had
agreed to take Dr. W. S. Bruce, but he found it impossible to
reach Melbourne in time to join the ship. A young Norwegian
resident in Australia, who was partly English in ancestry,
Carstens Egeberg Borchgrevink, shipped as a sailor, having an
insatiable desire to see the Antarctic regions and being refused
a passage on any other terms. The <i>Antarctic</i> sighted the
Balleny Islands and was nearly six weeks in working through the
pack, but on January 14, 1895, she was the first steamer to enter
the open water of Ross Sea. A landing was made on Possession
Island, where Borchgrevink discovered a lichen, the first trace
of vegetation found within the Antarctic Circle; the ship went as
far as 74&deg; South looking for whales and on her way back the first
landing on the Antarctic continent was made on a low beach at
Cape Adare.</p>
<p>Mr. Borchgrevink described this voyage at the meeting of the
Sixth International Geographical Congress in London in 1895,
where a great discussion on the possibility of renewing Antarctic
exploration had previously been arranged for. Dr. von Neumayer
gave an able historical paper on Antarctic exploration, Sir
Joseph Hooker spoke as a survivor of Ross' expedition. Sir John
Murray as a member of the scientific staff of the
<i>Challenger</i>, and Sir Clements Markham as President of the
Congress. The Congress adopted a resolution to the effect that
the exploration of the Antarctic Regions was the greatest piece
of geographical exploration remaining to be undertaken, and that
it should be resumed before the close of the nineteenth
century.</p>
<p>The first result was the expedition of the <i>Belgica</i>
under the command of Lieutenant de Gerlache, due to the
passionate enthusiasm of the commander, notably aided by Henryk
Ar&ccedil;towski, a Pole, whose ardour in the pursuit of physical
science has never been surpassed. Dr. Cook, an American, was
surgeon to the expedition; the second in command was Lieutenant
Lecointe, a Belgian, the mate, Roald Amundsen, a Norwegian, and
the crew were half Belgian and half Norwegian. The scientific
staff included, besides Ar&ccedil;towski, the Belgian magnetician
Lieutenant Danco, the Rumanian Racovitza, and the Pole
Dobrowolski. The funds were meagre and raised by public
subscription with enormous difficulty, and the equipment almost
less than the minimum requirement. The ship was small, only two
hundred and fifty tons, but in her this cosmopolitan gathering
experienced first of all men the long darkness of the Antarctic
night. Much valuable time was lost on the outward journey amongst
the Fuegian Islands, and much was occupied in the archipelago
into which the <i>Belgica</i> resolved Palmer Land, between 64&deg;
and 65&deg; South. It was February 12, 1898, before the ship
proceeded southward along the coast of Graham Land. On the 15th
she crossed the Antarctic Circle, on the 16th Alexander I Land
was sighted, but could not be approached within twenty miles on
account of the ice-pack. The equipment of the ship hardly seems
to have justified wintering; prudence called for a speedy
retreat, but a gale came down of such severity that Gerlache
thrust the ship into the pack for shelter from the heavy breakers
on February 28, and finding wide lanes opening under the
influence of wind and swell, he pushed southward against the
advice of the scientific members of the expedition, determined to
make every effort to outdistance all previous explorers towards
the pole. On March 3, 1898, the <i>Belgica</i> found herself in
71&deg; 30' South and about 85&deg; West. An effort to return was
unavailing; on the 4th she was fast in the floe, unable to move
in any direction, and she remained a prisoner of the ice until
February 14, 1899, and then took another month to clear all the
pack and reach the open sea. For a year she had been drifting
north, west, south and east, in Bellingshausen Sea; even in
winter the floe was never at rest, and almost all the time she
kept south of the parallel of 70&deg; over water which shallowed from
great depths in the north to about two hundred and fifty fathoms
in the southern stretches of the drift, evidently on the sloping
approach to extensive land. The expedition suffered greatly in
health during the winter from inadequate food, and from the
absence of proper light in the terrible darkness of the long
night. Despite all its difficulties the <i>Belgica</i> had done
more to promote a scientific knowledge of the Antarctic regions
than any of the costly expeditions that went before, and the
Belgian Government, coming to the rescue after her return,
provided adequate funds for working out the results.</p>
<p>Bellingshausen Sea was visited again in 1904 by Dr. J. B.
Charcot in the <i>Fran&ccedil;ais</i>, which followed the route of the
<i>Belgica</i> along the coast of Graham Land, afterwards
wintering in Port Charcot, a harbour on Wandel Island in 65&deg;
South. Returning southward in the summer of 1904-5 he discovered
land, named Terre Loubet, between Graham Land and Alexander I
Land, but its exact position has not been stated. This French
cruise was important as a preliminary to the expedition under
Charcot, which left in 1908 and is now in those waters with the
intention of pushing exploration to the Farthest South, in a ship
named with a dash of humour and a flash of hope the <i>Pourquoi
Pas?</i></p>
<p>Two voyages of exploration in Weddell Sea may for convenience
be referred to here. In October 1901, Dr. Otto Nordenskjold left
Gothenberg in the old <i>Antarctic</i>, under the command of
Captain Larsen, for an expedition which he had got up by his
personal efforts. He arrived at the South Shetlands in January
1902, but found it impossible even to reach the Antarctic Circle
on the coast of Oscar Land. Allowing the ship to go north for
work among the islands, Nordenskjold wintered for two years, 1902
and 1903, in a timber house on Snow Hill Island in 64&deg; 25' South.
Only one year's wintering had been contemplated, but the
<i>Antarctic</i> was crushed in the ice and sank, fortunately
without loss of life. A relief ship was despatched from Sweden,
but shortly before she arrived Nordenskjold and his companions
had been rescued by the unprotected Argentine naval vessel
<i>Uruguay</i>, under Captain Irizar.</p>
<p>Dr. W. S. Bruce, who had been to Weddell Sea in the
<i>Balaena</i> in 1892, and had since then taken part in several
Arctic expeditions, succeeded by dint of hard work and the
unceasing advocacy of the further exploration of Weddell Sea, in
enlisting the aid of a number of persons in Scotland, and notably
of Mr. James Coats, Jr., of Paisley, and Major Andrew Coats,
D.S.O., and fitting out an expedition on the <i>Scotia</i>. He
left the Clyde in November 1902, with Captain Thomas Robertson in
command of the ship, Mr. R. C. Mossman, the well-known
meteorologist, Mr. Rudmose Brown and Mr. D. W. Wilton as
naturalists, and Dr. J. H. H. Pirie as surgeon and geologist.
After calling at the South Orkneys, the <i>Scotia</i> got south
to 70&deg; 25' South in 17&deg; West on February 22, 1903, not far from
the position reached by Ross. Valuable oceanographical work was
done, and on returning to the South Orkneys, Mr. Mossman landed
there with a party to keep up regular meteorological observations
while the ship proceeded to the River Plate. On her return in the
following year the Argentine Government took over the
meteorological work in the South Orkneys, which has been kept up
ever since, to the great advancement of knowledge. The
<i>Scotia</i> made another dash to the south on the same meridian
as before, and on March 2, 1904, when in 72&deg; 18' South and 18&deg;
West, a high ice-barrier was seen stretching from north-east to
south-west, the depth of the sea being 1131 fathoms, a marked
diminution from the prevailing depths. The Barrier was
occasionally seen in intervals of mist, and March 6 being a clear
day allowed the edge to be followed to the south-west to a point
one hundred and fifty miles from the place where it was first
sighted. The depth, two and a half miles from the Barrier edge,
pack-ice preventing a nearer approach, was 159 fathoms. The
description of the appearance of the Barrier given in the "Cruise
of the <i>Scotia</i>" is very brief: "The surface of this great
Inland Ice of which the Barrier was the terminal face or
sea-front seemed to rise up very gradually in undulating slopes,
and faded away in height and distance into the sky, though in one
place there appeared to be the outline of distant hills; if so
they were entirely ice-covered, no naked rock being visible."
Ross or Moore would certainly have charted this as an "appearance
of land"; Bruce knew from the shoaling water and the nature of
the deposits that he was in the vicinity of land and gave it the
name of Coats Land after his principal supporters. He could get
no farther and returned from 74&deg; 1' South in 22&deg; West, a point
almost as far south as Weddell had got in his attempt one hundred
and eighty miles farther west. The <i>Scotia</i> rendered immense
service to science by her large biological collections, her
unique series of deep-sea soundings in high latitudes and the
permanent gain of a sub-Antarctic meteorological station.</p>
<p>The next step in exploration by way of Ross Sea was the
fitting-out by Sir George Newnes of an expedition under the
leadership of Mr. C. E. Borchgrevink, on board the <i>Southern
Cross</i>, a stout Norwegian whaler with Captain Jensen, who had
been chief officer in the <i>Antarctic</i> when she went to Ross
Sea in 1895, as master. Lieutenant Colbeck, R.N.R., went as
magnetic observer, Mr. L. C. Bernacchi, a resident in Tasmania,
who had arranged to join the <i>Belgica</i> if she had gone out
by Australia, as meteorologist, and Mr. Nicolai Hanson, of the
British Museum, as zoologist. The <i>Southern Cross</i> left
Hobart on December 19, 1898, and entered the pack about the
meridian of the Balleny Islands, 165&deg; East; but after being
forced out again on the northern side after six weeks' struggling
to get south, she re-entered the pack in 174&deg; East and was
through in the clear waters of Ross Sea in six hours on February
11, 1899. A wooden house and stores for the winter were landed at
Cape Adare in 71&deg; 15' South, and there the shore-party went into
winter quarters, the ship returning to the north. An important
series of meteorological observations was secured during the year
of residence, valuable zoological and geological collections were
made, and the habits of the penguins were studied; but the few
attempts at land exploration were without result. On January 28,
1900, Captain Jensen returned with the <i>Southern Cross</i> and
on February 2, the Cape Adare colony embarked and set out
southward along the coast of Victoria Land. Landings were
effected at various points, including the base of Mount
Melbourne, where reindeer-moss was found growing, and at Cape
Crozier. There was much less ice along the coast than when Ross
had visited it. The <i>Southern Cross</i>, after sighting Mount
Erebus and Mount Terror, ran eastward along the Great Barrier far
closer to the ice-cliffs than Ross could go in his sailing ships,
and Colbeck's survey showed that the Barrier had receded on the
whole some thirty miles to the south. Parts of the Barrier were
quite low, and Borchgrevink landed in 164&deg; West, the ship being
laid alongside the ice as if it had been a quay, and made a short
journey on ski southward over the surface on February 19, 1900,
reaching 78&deg; 50' South, forty miles beyond Ross' farthest and six
hundred and seventy miles from the Pole, the nearest yet
attained. The sea was beginning to freeze and the <i>Southern
Cross</i> made haste for home.</p>
<p>Following on various less weighty efforts set in motion by the
resolution of the International Geographical Congress in 1895,
all the eminent men of science who had the renewal of Antarctic
exploration at heart met in the rooms of the Royal Society in
London in February 1898, when Sir John Murray read a stimulating
paper. This was followed by a discussion in which part was taken
by the veteran Antarctic explorer Sir Joseph Hooker, by the most
successful of Arctic explorers Dr. Fridtjof Nansen, by Dr. von
Neumayer, who had never ceased for half a century to advocate
renewed exploration, and by Sir Clements Markham, President of
the Royal Geographical Society. A Joint Committee of the Royal
Society and the Royal Geographical Society undertook the
equipment of a British expedition and carried it through under
the constant stimulus and direction of Sir Clements Markham,
while funds were subscribed by various wealthy individuals, by
the Royal Geographical Society, and in largest measure by
Government. In Germany a national expedition was got up at the
same time under the command of Professor Erich von Drygalski to
co-operate by means of simultaneous magnetic and meteorological
observations in a different quarter with the British expedition.
For the present purpose it is enough to say that the German
expedition on board the <i>Gauss</i> descended on the Antarctic
Circle by the 90th meridian, and was caught in the pack at the
end of February 1902, not far from Wilkes' "appearance" of
Termination Land, and in sight of a hill called the Gaussberg on
a land discovered by the expedition and named Kaiser Wilhelm
Land. The ship remained fast for a year, and an immense amount of
scientific investigation was carried out with characteristic
thoroughness. On her release in February 1903, the <i>Gauss</i>
tried to push westward in a high latitude, but could not reach
the Antarctic Circle and, failing to get permission for another
season's work, she returned laden with rich scientific
collections and voluminous observations.</p>
<p>The Joint Committee in London built the <i>Discovery</i> at an
expense of &pound;52,000, making her immensely strong to resist ice
pressure and securing the absence of any magnetic metal in a
large area so that magnetic observations of high precision might
be carried out. Sir Clements Markham selected as commander
Lieutenant Robert F. Scott, R.N., a most fortunate choice, for no
one could have been better fitted by disposition and training to
ensure success. The second in command was Lieutenant Albert
Armitage, R.N.R., who had had Arctic experience, and the other
officers were Lieutenants C. Royds, R.N.; M. Barne, R.N.; E. H.
Shackleton, R.N.R.; Engineer-Lieutenant Skelton, R.N.; Dr. R.
Koettlitz, who had been a comrade of Armitage's in the north, and
Dr. E. A. Wilson, an artist of great ability. The scientific
staff included, in addition to the surgeons who were also
zoologists, Mr. L. C. Bernacchi, who had been on the <i>Southern
Cross</i> expedition, as physicist; as biologist Mr. T. V.
Hodgson, and as geologist Mr. H. T. Ferrar. Meteorological and
oceanographical work were undertaken by officers of the ship. The
objects of the expedition were primarily magnetic observations,
the costly construction of the ship being largely due to the
arrangements for this purpose, then meteorological and
oceanographical observations and the collection of zoological and
geological specimens, and of course geographical exploration.
Three pieces of exploration were specified in the instructions,
an attempt to reach the land which Ross believed to exist east of
the Barrier, though he charted it as an appearance only, a
journey westward into the mountains of Victoria Land, and a
journey southward. An attempt to reach the Pole was neither
recommended nor forbidden. The Royal Geographical Society has
always deprecated attempts to attain high latitudes north or
south unless as an incident in systematic scientific work. The
<i>Discovery</i> left Lyttelton on December 24, 1901, met the
pack on January 1, 1902, and got through it into Ross Sea in a
week in 174&deg; East. Landings were made at Cape Adare, at various
points along the coast of Victoria Land, and on January 22 at the
base of Mount Terror, near Cape Crozier. From this point the
Great Barrier was coasted to the east, close along its edge, and
on the 29th in 165&deg; East the depth of water was found to be less
than a hundred fathoms, a strong indication of the approach to
land. The Barrier had receded about thirty miles since Ross was
in those seas, and there was much less pack-ice than during his
visit; the date also was earlier and Scott was able to penetrate
almost to 150&deg; West before being stopped by heavy ice. The land
was plainly seen, its higher summits being 2000 to 3000 ft. above
the sea, and bare rocks projected from the snow covering of the
hills. Thus the first geographical problem set to the expedition
was promptly and satisfactorily solved. Although no landing was
made on King Edward VII Land, the King's first godchild of
discovery, as Victoria Land had been the late Queen's, the
<i>Discovery</i> was laid alongside a low part of the Barrier in
164&deg; West, and the captive balloon was raised for a comprehensive
view. Returning to McMurdo Bay, Scott showed that the Parry
Mountains, running south from Mount Erebus, were not in fact
there; Ross had probably seen the southern range across the
Barrier. It soon became evident that Ross' original impression
that Mount Erebus rose from an island was correct, and this land
was named Ross Island. McMurdo Bay also was found not to be a bay
at all, but the opening of a strait leading southward between
Ross Island and the mainland. By the middle of February 1902, the
<i>Discovery</i> had taken up winter quarters on the extreme
south of Ross Island, and a large hut had been erected on shore,
with smaller huts for the magnetic and other instruments. The
winter, four hundred miles farther south than any man had
wintered before, was passed pleasantly by all, a great feature
being the appearance of the <i>South Polar Times</i>, which owed
much of its attractiveness to the editorship of E. H. Shackleton
and to the art of E. A. Wilson.</p>
<p>With the spring a new era in Antarctic exploration was
inaugurated in the series of sledge Journeys, for which elaborate
preparations had been made. Here Captain Scott showed himself
possessed of all the qualities of a pioneer, adapting the methods
of Sir Leopold McClintock and Dr. Nansen for Arctic ice travel to
the different conditions prevailing in the Antarctic. In
preparation for the great effort towards the south a depot had
been laid out on the ice, and on November 2, 1902, Scott,
Shackleton and Wilson, with four sledges and nineteen dogs,
stepped out into the unknown on the surface of the Barrier. It
was necessary at first to make the journeys by relays, going over
the ground three times to bring up the stores; but the loads were
lightened as the food was used and by leaving a depot in 80&deg; 30'
South to be picked up on the return journey. Snowy weather was
experienced but the temperature was not excessively low. The
dogs, however, rapidly weakened, but by December 30, the little
party reached latitude 82&deg; 17' South, after fifty-nine days'
travelling from winter quarters in 77&deg; 49' South. They had passed
over comparatively uniform snow-covered ice, probably afloat, and
their track stretched parallel to a great mountain range which
rose on their right. Whenever they approached the position of the
mountains the surface was always found to be rougher, thrown into
ridges or cleft by great crevasses. Failing provisions compelled
them to stop at length, and a great chasm in the ice prevented
them from reaching the land; but they had made their way to a
point 3&deg; 27' or 297 miles farther south than Borchgrevink and
were 463 miles from the Pole. It was the greatest advance ever
made over a previous farthest in poleward progress in either
hemisphere, and the first long land journey in the Antarctic.
Great mountain summits were seen beyond the farthest point
reached; one named Mount Markham rose to about 15,000 ft.,
another, Mount Longstaff, was lower but farther south. The range
appeared to be trending south-eastward in the distance. The
return journey was made in thirty-four days, and the ship was
reached on February 3, 1903; the dogs were all dead and had long
been useless, the men themselves had been attacked by scurvy, the
ancient scourge of polar explorers, and Shackleton's health was
in a very serious state; but a journey such as had never been
made before had been accomplished, and new methods of travel had
been evolved and tested. Meantime shorter expeditions had been
sent out from winter quarters, and Armitage had pioneered a way
up one of the great glaciers which descended from the western
mountains. The relief ship <i>Morning</i>, under Captain Colbeck,
who had charted the Barrier on the <i>Southern Cross</i>
expedition, arrived in McMurdo Sound on January 25, 1903; but
unbroken sea ice prevented the ship from reaching the
<i>Discovery</i>'s winter quarters by ten miles. On March 3 she
sailed for the north, leaving Lieutenant Mulock, R.N., to take
the place of Lieutenant Shackleton, who was a reluctant
passenger, invalided home. In the second winter the acetylene
gas-plant was brought into use, and by this means the
living-rooms were lighted brilliantly, and with the fresh food
brought by the <i>Morning</i>, the sufferers from scurvy
recovered, and the health of all remained excellent throughout
the winter. Sledge expeditions set out again early in the spring,
the most successful being that led by Captain Scott into the
western mountains. Starting on October 26, he ascended the Ferrar
Glacier to the summit of a great plateau of which the mountains
formed the broken edge, and the party travelled without dogs,
hauling their own sledges over a flat surface of compacted snow
nine thousand feet above sea-level to the longitude of 146&deg; 33'
East, a distance of 278 statute miles from the ship. This journey
proved the existence of a surface beyond the mountains which,
although only to be reached by the toilsome and dangerous
climbing of a crevassed glacier, and subject to the intensified
cold of high altitudes, was as practicable as the Barrier surface
itself for rapid travelling, as rapidity is counted in those
regions. Thus Scott was able to demonstrate the facility of both
kinds of ice travel, over the Antarctic continent as over the
Antarctic Sea.</p>
<p>On February 19, 1904, the <i>Discovery</i> escaped from the
harbour in which she had been frozen for two years. The
<i>Morning</i> had again come south to meet her with orders to
desert the ship if she could not be freed from the ice; and a
larger ship, the Terra Nova, had been sent by the Admiralty to
satisfy the fears of nervous hearts at home. The one thing
wanting to round off the expedition was a supply of coal to
enable the <i>Discovery</i> to follow the track of Wilkes'
vessels from the Balleny Islands westward; but the relief ships
were only able to spare a trifling quantity and the opportunity
was lost. Scott carried on to the west far south of Wilkes' route
to 154&deg; East, showing that the land charted by the American
expedition west of that meridian did not exist in the assigned
positions; then with barely coal enough left to carry her to New
Zealand the <i>Discovery</i> left the Antarctic regions and the
great South Polar expedition came to an end. It is interesting to
note that although no catastrophe such as those which darken the
pages of Arctic history has ever happened in the Antarctic, no
expedition had gone out without the loss of some of its members
by accident or illness. On the <i>Discovery</i> the two deaths
which occurred were by accident only.</p>
<p>The <i>Gauss</i> and the <i>Discovery</i> were sold soon after
the return of the expeditions; the working up and publication of
the scientific results obtained were for the most part entrusted
to museums and public institutions; the members of the
expeditions returned to their former duties or sought new
employments, and the societies which had promoted the expeditions
turned their attention to other things. The South Polar regions
were left as the arena of private efforts, and in this volume the
reader will learn how the enthusiasm and devotion of an
individual has once more vindicated the character of the British
nation for going far and faring well in the face of difficulties
before which it would have been no dishonour to turn back.</p>

<br>
<h3>THE INCEPTION AND PREPARATION OF THE EXPEDITION</h3>
<p><b>MEN</b> go out into the void spaces of the world for
various reasons. Some are actuated simply by a love of adventure,
some have the keen thirst for scientific knowledge, and others
again are drawn away from the trodden paths by the "lure of
little voices", the mysterious fascination of the unknown. I
think that in my own case it was a combination of these factors
that determined me to try my fortune once again in the frozen
south. I had been invalided home before the conclusion of the
<i>Discovery</i> expedition, and I had a very keen desire to see
more of the vast continent that lies amid the Antarctic snows and
glaciers. Indeed the stark polar lands grip the hearts of the men
who have lived on them in a manner that can hardly be understood
by the people who have never got outside the pale of
civilisation. I was convinced, moreover, that an expedition on
the lines I had in view could justify itself by the results of
its scientific work. The <i>Discovery</i> expedition had brought
back a great store of information, and had performed splendid
service in several important branches of science. I believed that
a second expedition could carry the work still further. The
<i>Discovery</i> expedition had gained knowledge of the great
chain of mountains running in a north and south direction from
Cape Adare to latitude 82&deg; 17' South, but whether this range
turned to the south-east or eastward for any considerable
distance was not known, and therefore the southern limits of the
Great Ice Barrier plain had not been defined. The glimpses gained
of King Edward VII Land from the deck of the <i>Discovery</i> had
not enabled us to determine either its nature or its extent, and
the mystery of the Barrier remained unsolved. It was a matter of
importance to the scientific world that information should be
gained regarding the movement of the ice-sheet that forms the
Barrier. Then I wanted to find out what lay beyond the mountains
to the south of latitude 82&deg; 17' and whether the Antarctic
continent rose to a plateau similar to the one found by Captain
Scott beyond the western mountains. There was much to be done in
the field of meteorology, and this work was of particular
importance to Australia and New Zealand, for these countries are
affected by weather conditions that have their origin in the
Antarctic. Antarctic zoology, though somewhat limited, as
regarded the range of species, had very interesting aspects, and
I wanted to devote some attention to mineralogy, apart from
general geology. The Aurora Australis, atmospheric electricity,
tidal movements, hydrography, currents of the air, ice formations
and movements, biology and geology, offered an unlimited field
for research, and the despatch of an expedition seemed to be
justified on scientific grounds quite apart from the desire to
gain a high latitude.</p>
<p>The difficulty that confronts most men who wish to undertake
exploration work is that of finance, and in this respect I was
rather more than ordinarily handicapped. The equipment and
despatch of an Antarctic expedition means the expenditure of very
many thousands of pounds, without the prospect of any speedy
return, and with a reasonable probability of no return at all. I
drew up my scheme on the most economical lines, as regarded both
ship and staff, but for over a year I tried vainly to raise
sufficient money to enable me to make a start. I secured
introductions to a wealthy men, and urged to the best of my
ability the importance of the work I proposed to undertake, but
the money was not forthcoming, and it almost seemed as though I
should have to abandon the venture altogether. I persisted, and
towards the end of 1906 I was encouraged by promises of support
from one or two personal friends. Then I made a fresh effort, and
on February 12, 1907, I had enough money promised to enable me to
announce definitely that I would go south with an expedition. As
a matter of fact some of the promises of support made to me could
not be fulfilled, and I was faced by financial difficulties right
up to the time when the expedition sailed from England. It was
not till I arrived in New Zealand, and the Governments of New
Zealand and Australia came to my assistance with ready
generosity, that the position became more satisfactory.</p>
<p>In the <i>Geographical Journal</i> for March 1907 I outlined
my plan of campaign, but this had to be changed in several
respects at a later date owing to the exigencies of
circumstances. My intention was that the expedition should leave
New Zealand at the beginning of 1908, and proceed to winter
quarters on the Antarctic continent, the ship to land the men and
stores and then return. By avoiding having the ship frozen in, I
would render the use of a relief ship unnecessary, as the same
vessel could come south again the following summer and take us
off. "The shore-party of nine or twelve men will winter with
sufficient equipment to enable three separate parties to start
out in the spring," I announced. "One party will go east, and, if
possible, across the Barrier to the new land known as King Edward
VII Land, follow the coastline there south, if the coast trends
south, or north if north, returning when it is considered
necessary to do so. The second party will proceed south over the
same route as that of the southern sledge-party of the
<i>Discovery</i>; this party will keep from fifteen to twenty
miles from the coast, so as to avoid any rough ice. The third
party will possibly proceed westward over the mountains, and,
instead of crossing in a line due west, will strike towards the
magnetic pole. The main changes in equipment will be that
Siberian ponies will be taken for the sledge journeys both east
and south, and also a specially designed motor-car for the
southern journey.... I do not intend to sacrifice the scientific
utility of the expedition to a mere record-breaking journey, but
say frankly, all the same, that one of my great efforts will be
to reach the southern geographical pole. I shall in no way
neglect to continue the biological, meteorological, geological
and magnetic work of the <i>Discovery</i>. I added that I would
endeavour to sail along the coast of Wilkes Land, and secure
definite information regarding that coastline.</p>
<p>The programme was an ambitious one for a small expedition, no
doubt, but I was confident, and I think I may claim that in some
measure my confidence has been justified. Before we finally left
England, I had decided that if possible I would establish my base
on King Edward VII Land instead of at the <i>Discovery</i> winter
quarters in McMurdo Sound, so that we might break entirely new
ground. The narrative will show how completely, as far as this
particular matter was concerned, all my plans were upset by the
demands of the situation. The journey to King Edward VII Land
over the Barrier was not attempted, owing largely to the
unexpected loss of ponies before the winter. I laid all my plans
very carefully, basing them on experience I had gained with the
<i>Discovery</i> expedition, and in the fitting out of the relief
ships <i>Terra Nova</i> and <i>Morning</i>, and the
<i>Argentine</i> expedition that went to the relief of the
Swedes. I decided that I would have no committee, as the
expedition was entirely my own venture, and I wished to supervise
personally all the arrangements.</p>
<p>When I found that some promises of support had failed me and
had learned that the Royal Geographical Society, though
sympathetic in its attitude, could not see its way to assist
financially, I approached several gentlemen and suggested that
they should guarantee me at the bank, the guarantees to be
redeemed by me in 1910, after the return of the expedition. It
was on this basis that I secured a sum of &pound;20,000, the greater
part of the money necessary for the starting of the expedition,
and I cannot express too warmly my appreciation of the faith
shown in me and my plans by the men who gave these guarantees,
which could be redeemed only by the proceeds of lectures and the
sale of this book after the expedition had concluded its work.
These preliminary matters settled, I started to buy stores and
equipment, to negotiate for a ship, and to collect round me the
men who would form the expedition.</p>
<p>The equipping of a polar expedition is a task demanding
experience as well as the greatest attention to points of detail.
When the expedition has left civilisation, there is no
opportunity to repair any omission or to secure any article that
may have been forgotten. It is true that the explorer is expected
to be a handy man, able to contrive dexterously with what
materials he may have at hand, but makeshift appliances mean
increased difficulty and added danger. The aim of one who
undertakes to organise such an expedition must be to provide for
every contingency, and in dealing with this work I was fortunate
in being able to secure the assistance of Mr. Alfred Reid, who
had already gained considerable experience in connection with
previous polar ventures. I appointed Mr. Reid manager of the
expedition, and I found him an invaluable assistant. I was
fortunate, too, in not being hampered by committees of any sort.
I kept the control of all the arrangements in my own hands, and
thus avoided the delays that are inevitable when a group of men
have to arrive at a decision on points of detail.</p>
<p>The first step was to secure an office in London, and we
selected a furnished room at 9 Regent Street, as the headquarters
of the expedition. The staff at this period consisted of Mr.
Reid, a district messenger and myself, but there was a
typewriting office on the same floor, and the correspondence,
which grew in bulk day by day, could be dealt with as rapidly as
though I had employed stenographers and typists of my own. I had
secured estimates of the cost of provisioning and equipping the
expedition before I made any public announcement regarding my
intentions, so that there were no delays when once active work
had commenced. This was not an occasion for inviting tenders,
because it was Ad tally important that we should have the best of
everything, whether in food or gear, and I therefore selected, in
consultation with Mr. Reid, the firms that should be asked to
supply us. Then we proceeded to interview the heads of these
firms, and we found that in nearly every instance we were met
with generous treatment as to prices, and with ready co-operation
in regard to details of manufacture and packing.</p>
<p>Several very important points have to be kept in view in
selecting the food supplies for a polar expedition. In the first
place the food must be wholesome and nourishing in the highest
degree possible. At one time that dread disease scurvy used to be
regarded as the inevitable result of a prolonged stay in the
ice-bound regions, and even the <i>Discovery</i> expedition,
during its labours in the Antarctic in the years 1902-4, suffered
from this complaint, which is often produced by eating preserved
food that is not in a perfectly wholesome condition. It is now
recognised that scurvy may be avoided if the closest attention is
given to the preparation and selection of food-stuffs along
scientific lines, and I may say at once that our efforts in this
direction were successful, for during the whole course of the
expedition we had not one case of sickness attributable directly
or indirectly to the foods we had brought with us. Indeed, beyond
a few colds, apparently due to germs from a bale of blankets, we
experienced no sickness at all at the winter quarters.</p>
<p>In the second place the food taken for use on the sledging
expeditions must be as light as possible, remembering always that
extreme concentration renders the food less easy of assimilation
and therefore less healthful. Extracts that may be suitable
enough for use in ordinary climates are little use in the polar
regions, because under conditions of very low temperature the
heat of the body can be maintained only by use of fatty and
farinaceous foods in fairly large quantities. Then the
sledging-foods must be such as do not require prolonged cooking,
that is to say, it must be sufficient to bring them to the
boiling-point, for the amount of fuel that can be carried is
limited. It must be possible to eat the foods without cooking at
all, for the fuel may be lost or become exhausted.</p>
<p>More latitude is possible in the selection of foods to be used
at the winter quarters of the expedition, for the ship may be
expected to reach that point, and weight is therefore of less
importance. My aim was to secure a large variety of foods for use
during the winter night. The long months of darkness impose a
severe strain on any men unaccustomed to the conditions, and it
is desirable to relieve the monotony in every way possible. A
variety of food is healthful, moreover, and this is especially
important at a period when it is difficult for the men to take
much exercise, and when sometimes they are practically confined
to the hut for days together by bad weather.</p>
<p>All these points were taken into consideration in the
selection of our food-stuffs, and the list that I append shows
the more important items of our provisions. I based my estimates
on the requirements of twelve men for two years, but this was
added to in New Zealand when I increased the staff. Some
important articles of food were presented to the expedition by
the manufacturers, and others, such as the biscuits and pemmican,
were specially manufactured to my order. The question of packing
presented some difficulties, and I finally decided to use
"Venesta" cases for the food-stuffs and as much as possible of
the equipment. These cases are manufactured from composite boards
prepared by uniting three layers of birch or other hard wood with
waterproof cement. They are light, weatherproof and strong, and
proved to be eminently suited to our purposes. The cases I
ordered measured about two feet six inches by fifteen inches, and
we used about 2500 of them. The saving of weight, as compared
with an ordinary packing-case, was about four pounds per case,
and we had no trouble at all with breakages, in spite of the
rough handling given our stores in the process of landing at Cape
Royds after the expedition had reached the Antarctic regions.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Some additions were made to our food-supplies after the
arrival of the <i>Nimrod</i> in New Zealand. Messrs. Nathan and
Company, of Wellington, presented the expedition with sixty-eight
cases of "Glaxo" dried milk, and this preparation, which consists
of the solid constituents of fresh milk, was a valuable addition
to our food-stuffs. The same firm presented us with 192 lb. of
New Zealand butter and two cases of New Zealand cheese. Some
farmers generously provided thirty-two live sheep, which were
killed in the Antarctic and allowed to freeze for winter
consumption. Several other acceptable gifts were made to us
before the <i>Nimrod</i> left Lyttelton.</p>
<p>It was arranged that supplies for thirty-eight men for one
year should be carried by the <i>Nimrod</i> when the vessel went
south for the second time to bring back the shore-party. This was
a precautionary measure in case the <i>Nimrod</i> should get
caught in the ice and compelled to spend a winter in the
Antarctic, in which case we would still have had one year's
provisions in hand. I append a list showing the principal items
of the relief supplies.</p>

<p>After placing some of the principal orders for food-supplies,
I went to Norway with Mr. Reid in order to secure the sledges,
fur boots and mits, sleeping-bags, ski, and some other articles
of equipment. I was fortunate, on the voyage from Hull to
Christiania, in making the acquaintance of Captain Pepper, the
commodore captain of the Wilson Line of steamers. He took a keen
interest in the expedition, and he was of very great assistance
to me in the months that followed, for he undertook to inspect
the sledges in the process of manufacture. He was at Christiania
once in each fortnight, and he personally looked to the lashings
and seizings as only a sailor could. We arrived at Christiania on
April 22, and then learned that Mr. C. S. Christiansen, the maker
of the sledges used on the <i>Discovery</i> expedition, was in
the United States. This was a disappointment, but after
consultation with Scott-Hansen, who was the first lieutenant of
the <i>Fram</i> on Nansen's famous expedition, I decided to place
the work in the hands of Messrs. L. H. Hagen and Company. The
sledges were to be of the Nansen pattern, built of specially
selected timber, and of the best possible workmanship. I ordered
ten twelve-foot sledges, eighteen eleven-foot sledges! and two
seven-foot sledges. The largest ones would be suitable for
pony-haulage. The eleven foot ones could be drawn by either
ponies or men, and the small pattern would be useful for work
around the winter quarters and for short journeys such as the
scientists of the expedition were likely to undertake. The
timbers used for the sledges were seasoned ash and American
hickory, and in addition to Captain Pepper, Captain Isaachsen and
Lieutenant Scott-Hansen, both experienced Arctic explorers,
watched the work of construction on my behalf. Their interest was
particularly valuable to me, for they were able in many little
ways hardly to be understood by the lay reader to ensure
increased strength and efficiency. I had formed the opinion that
an eleven-foot sledge was best for general work, for it was not
so long as to be unwieldy, and at the same time was long enough
to ride over sastrugi and hummocky ice. Messrs. Hagen and Company
did their work thoroughly well, and the sledges proved all that I
could have desired.</p>
<p>The next step was to secure the furs that the expedition would
require, and for this purpose we went to Drammen and made the
necessary arrangements with Mr. W. C. Moller. We selected skins
for the sleeping-bags, taking those of young reindeer, with short
thick fur, less liable to come out under conditions of dampness
than is the fur of the older deer. Our furs did not make a very
large order, for after the experience of the <i>Discovery</i>
expedition I decided to use fur only for the feet and hands and
for the sleeping-bags, relying for all other purposes on woollen
garments with an outer covering of wind-proof material. I ordered
three large sleeping-bags, to hold three men each, and twelve
one-man bags. Each bag had the reindeer fur inside, and the seams
were covered with leather, strongly sewn. The flaps overlapped
about eight inches, and the head of the bag was sewn up to the
top of the fly. There were three toggles for fastening the bag up
when the man was inside. The toggles were about eight inches
apart. The one-man bags weighed about ten pounds when dry, but of
course the weight increased as they absorbed moisture when in
use.</p>
<p>The foot-gear I ordered consisted of eighty pairs of ordinary
finnesko, or reindeer fur boots, twelve pairs of special finnesko
and sixty pairs of ski boots of various sizes. The ordinary
finnesko is made from the skin of the reindeer stag's head, with
the fur outside, and its shape is roughly that of a very large
boot without any laces. It is large enough to hold the foot,
several pairs of socks, and a supply of sennegrass, and it is a
wonderfully comfortable and warm form of foot-gear. The special
finnesko are made from the skin of the reindeer stag's legs, but
they are not easily secured, for the reason that the native
tribes, not unreasonably, desire to keep the best goods for
themselves. I had a man sent to Lapland to barter for finnesko of
the best kind, but he only succeeded in getting twelve pairs. The
ski boots are made of soft leather, with the upper coming right
round under the sole, and a flat piece of leather sewn on top of
the upper. They are made specially for use with ski, and are very
useful for summer wear. They give the foot plenty of play and do
not admit water. The heel is very low, so that the foot can rest
firmly on the ski. I bought five prepared reindeer skins for
repairing, and a supply of repairing gear, such as sinew, needles
and waxed thread.</p>
<p>I have mentioned that sennegrass is used in the finnesko. This
is a dried grass of long fibre, with a special quality of
absorbing moisture. I bought fifty kilos (109.37 lb.) in Norway
for use on the expedition. The grass is sold in wisps, bound up
tightly, and when the finnesko are being put on, some of it is
teased out and a pad placed along the sole under the foot. Then
when the boot has been pulled on more grass is stuffed round the
heel. The grass absorbs the moisture that is given off from the
skin, and prevents the sock freezing to the sole of the boot,
which would then be difficult to remove at night. The grass is
pulled out at night, shaken loose, and allowed to freeze. The
moisture that has been collected congeals in the form of frost,
and the greater part of it can be shaken away before the grass is
replaced on the following morning. The grass is gradually used up
on the march, and it is necessary to take a fairly large supply,
but it is very light and takes up little room.</p>
<p>I ordered from Mr. Moller sixty pairs of wolfskin and dogskin
mits, made with the fur outside, and sufficiently long to protect
the wrists. The mits had one compartment for the four fingers and
another for the thumb, and they were worn over woollen gloves.
They were easily slipped off when the use of the fingers was
required, and they were hung round the neck with lamp-wick in
order that they might not get lost on the march. The only other
articles of equipment I ordered in Norway were twelve pairs of
ski, which were supplied by Messrs. Hagen and Company. They were
not used on the sledging journeys at all, but were useful around
the winter quarters. I stipulated that all the goods were to be
delivered in London by June 15, for the <i>Nimrod</i> was to
leave England on June 30.</p>
<p>At this time I had not finally decided to buy the
<i>Nimrod</i>, though the vessel was under offer to me, and
before I left Norway I paid a visit to Sandy fjord in order to
see whether I could come to terms with Mr. C. Christiansen, the
owner of the <i>Bjorn</i>. This ship was specially built for
polar work, and would have suited my purposes most admirably. She
was a new vessel of about 700 tons burthen and with powerful
triple-expansion engines, better equipped in every way than the
forty-year-old <i>Nimrod</i>, but I found that I could not afford
to buy her, much as I would have wished to do so. Finally, I
placed orders with some of the Norwegian food-preserving
companies for special tinned foods such as fish balls, roast
reindeer and roast ptarmigan, which were very attractive luxuries
during the winter night in the south.</p>
<p>When I returned to London I purchased the <i>Nimrod</i>, which
was then engaged on a sealing venture, and was expected to return
to Newfoundland within a short time. The ship was small and old,
and her maximum speed under steam was hardly more than six knots,
but on the other hand, she was strongly built, and quite able to
face rough treatment in the ice. Indeed, she had already received
a good many hard knocks in the course of a varied career. The
<i>Nimrod</i> did not return to Newfoundland as soon as I had
hoped, and when she did arrive she proved to be somewhat damaged
from contact with the ice, which had overrun her and damaged her
bulwarks. She was inspected on my behalf and pronounced sound,
and, making a fairly rapid passage, arrived in the Thames on June
15. I must confess that I was disappointed when I first examined
the little ship, to which I was about to commit the hopes and
aspiration of many years. She was very dilapidated and smelt
strongly of seal-oil, and an inspection in dock showed that she
required caulking and that her masts would have to be renewed.
She was rigged only as a schooner and her masts were decayed, and
I wanted to be able to sail her in the event of the engine
breaking down or the supply of coal running short. There was only
a few weeks to elapse before the date fixed for our departure,
and it was obvious that we would have to push the work ahead very
quickly if she was to be ready in time. I had not then become
acquainted with the many good qualities of the <i>Nimrod</i>, and
my first impression hardly did justice to the plucky old
ship.</p>
<p>I proceeded at once to put the ship in the hands of Messrs. R.
and H. Green, of Blackwall, the famous old firm that built so
many of Britain's "wooden walls", and that had done fitting and
repair work for several other polar expeditions. She was docked
for the necessary caulking, and day by day assumed a more
satisfactory appearance. The signs of former conflicts with the
ice-floes disappeared, and the masts and running-gear were
prepared for the troubled days that were to come. Even the
penetrating odour of seal-oil ceased to offend after much
vigorous scrubbing of decks and holds, and I began to feel that
after all the <i>Nimrod</i> would do the expedition no discredit.
Later still I grew really proud of the sturdy little ship.</p>
<p>In the meantime Mr. Reid and myself had been very busy
completing the equipment of the expedition, and I had been
gathering round me the men who were to compose the staff. As I
had indicated when making the first announcement regarding the
expedition, I did not intend that the <i>Nimrod</i> should remain
in the Antarctic during the winter. The ship was to land a
shore-party, with stores and equipment, and then to return to New
Zealand, where she would wait until the time arrived to bring us
back to civilisation. It was therefore very necessary that we
should have a reliable hut in which to live during the Antarctic
night until the sledging journeys commenced. The hut would be our
only refuge from the fury of the blizzards and the intense cold
of the winter months. I thought then that the hut would have to
accommodate twelve men, though the number was later increased to
fifteen, and I decided that the outside measurements should be
thirty-three feet by nineteen feet by eight feet to the eaves.
This was not large, especially in view of the fact that we would
have to store many articles of equipment and some of the food in
the hut, but a small building meant economy in fuel. The hut was
specially constructed to my order by Messrs. Humphreys, of
Knightsbridge, and after being erected and inspected in London
was shipped in sections in the <i>Nimrod</i>.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-diag01"></a><img alt=""
src="1202361h-images/hs-diag01.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>D1. SECTION SHOWING INTERIOR OF <i>NIMROD</i></small></p>
<p>It was made of stout fir timbering of best quality in walls,
roofs, and floors, and the parts were all morticed and tenoned to
facilitate erection in the Antarctic. The walls were strengthened
with iron cleats bolted to main posts and horizontal timbering,
and the roof principals were provided with strong iron tie rods.
The hut was lined with match-boarding, and the walls and roof
were covered externally first with strong roofing felt, then with
one-inch tongued and grooved boards, and finally with another
covering of felt. In addition to these precautions against the
extreme cold the four-inch space in framing between the
match-boarding and the first covering of felt was packed with
granulated cork, which assisted materially to render the wall
non-conducting. The hut was to be erected on wooden piles let
into the ground or ice, and rings were fixed to the apex of the
roof so that guy ropes might be used to give additional
resistance to the gales. The hut had two doors, connected by a
small porch, so that ingress and egress would not mean the
admission of a draught of cold air, and the windows were double,
in order that the warmth of the hut might be retained. There were
two louvre ventilators in the roof, controlled from the inside.
The hut had no fittings, and we took little furniture, only some
chairs. I proposed to use cases for the construction of benches,
beds and other necessary articles of internal equipment. The hut
was to be lit with acetylene gas, and we took a generator, the
necessary piping, and a supply of carbide.</p>
<p>The cooking-range we used in the hut was manufactured by
Messrs. Smith and Wellstead, of London, and was four feet wide by
two feet four inches deep. It had a fire chamber designed to burn
anthracite coal continuously day and night and to heat a large
superficial area of outer plate, so that there might be plenty of
warmth given off in the hut. The stove had two ovens and a
chimney of galvanised steel pipe, capped by a revolving cowl. It
was mounted on legs. This stove was erected in the hut at the
winter quarters, and with it we heated the building and did all
our cooking while we were there. We took also a portable stove on
legs, with a hot-water generator at the back of the fire,
connected with a fifteen-gallon tank, but this stove was not
erected, as we did not find that a second stove was required.</p>
<p>For use on the sledging expeditions I took six "Nansen"
cookers made of aluminium, and of the pattern that has been
adopted, with slight modifications, ever since Nansen made his
famous journey in 1893-96. The sledging-tents, of which I bought
six, were made of light Willesden rot-proof drill, with a "spout"
entrance of Burberry gaberdine. They were green in colour, as the
shade is very restful to the eyes on the white snow plains, and
weighed thirty pounds each, complete with five poles and
floorcloth.</p>
<p>Each member of the expedition was supplied with two winter
suits made of heavy blue pilot cloth, lined with Jaeger fleece. A
suit consisted of a double-breasted jacket, vest and trousers,
and weighed complete fourteen and three-quarter pounds. The
underclothing was secured from the Dr. Jaeger Sanitary Woollen
Company, and I ordered the following articles:</p>

</table>
<p>An outer suit of windproof material is necessary in the polar
regions, and I secured twenty-four suits of Burberry gaberdine,
each suit consisting of a short blouse, trouser overalls and a
helmet cover. For use in the winter quarters we took four dozen
Jaeger camel-hair blankets and sixteen camel-hair triple
sleeping-bags.</p>
<p>I decided to take ponies, dogs, and a motor-car to assist in
hauling our sledges on the long journeys that I had in view, but
my hopes were based mainly on the ponies. Dogs had not proved
satisfactory on the Barrier surface, and I had not expected my
dogs to do as well as they actually did. The use of a motor-car
was an experiment which I thought justified by my experience of
the character of the Barrier surface, but I knew that it would
not do to place much reliance on the machine in view of the
uncertainty of the conditions. I felt confident, however, that
the hardy ponies used in Northern China and Manchuria would be
useful if they could be landed on the ice in good condition. I
had seen these ponies in Shanghai, and I had heard of the good
work they did on the Jackson-Harmsworth expedition. They are
accustomed to hauling heavy loads in a very low temperature, and
they are hardy, sure-footed and plucky. I noticed that they had
been used with success for very rough work during the
Russo-Japanese War, and a friend who had lived in Siberia gave me
some more information regarding their capabilities.</p>
<p>I therefore got into communication with the London manager of
the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank (Mr. C. S. Addis), and he was
able to secure the services of a leading firm of veterinary
surgeons in Shanghai. A qualified man went to Tientsin on my
behalf, and from a mob of about two thousand of the ponies,
brought down for sale from the northern regions, he selected
fifteen of the little animals for my expedition. The ponies
chosen were all over twelve and under seventeen years in age, and
had spent the early part of their lives in the interior of
Manchuria. They were practically unbroken, were about fourteen
hands high, and were of various colours. They were all splendidly
strong and healthy, full of tricks and wickedness, and ready for
any amount of hard work over the snowfields. The fifteen ponies
were taken to the coast and shipped by direct steamer to
Australia. They came through the test of tropical temperatures
unscathed, and at the end of October 1908 arrived in Sydney,
where they were met by Mr. Reid and at once transferred to a New
Zealand bound steamer. The Colonial Governments kindly consented
to suspend the quarantine restrictions, which would have entailed
exposure to summer heat for many weeks, and thirty-five days
after leaving China the ponies were landed on Quail Island in
Port Lyttelton, and were free to scamper about and feed in idle
luxury.</p>
<p>I decided to take a motor-car because I thought it possible,
from my previous experience, that we might meet with a hard
surface on the Great Ice Barrier, over which the first part at
any rate of the journey towards the south would have to be
performed. On a reasonably good surface the machine would be able
to haul a heavy load at a rapid pace. I selected a 12-15
horsepower New Arrol-Johnston car, fitted with a specially
designed air-cooled four-cylinder engine and Simms Bosch magneto
ignition. Water could not be used for cooling, as it would
certainly freeze. Round the carburetter was placed a small
jacket, and the exhaust gases from one cylinder were passed
through this in order that they might warm the mixing chamber
before passing into the air. The exhaust from the other cylinders
was conveyed into a silencer that was also to act as a
foot-warmer. The frame of the car was of the standard pattern,
but the manufacturers had taken care to secure the maximum of
strength, in view of the fact that the car was likely to
experience severe strains at low temperature. I ordered a good
supply of spare parts in order to provide for breakages, and a
special non-freezing oil was prepared for me by Messrs. Price and
Company. Petrol was taken in the ordinary tins. I secured wheels
of several special patterns as well as ordinary wheels with
rubber tyres, and I had manufactured wooden runners to be placed
under the front wheels for soft surfaces, the wheels resting in
chocks on top of the runners. The car in its original form had
two bracket seats, and a large trough behind for carrying stores.
It was packed in a large case and lashed firmly amidships on the
<i>Nimrod</i>, in which position it made the journey to the
Antarctic continent in safety.</p>
<p>I placed little reliance on the dogs, as I have already
stated, but I thought it advisable to take some of these animals.
I knew that a breeder in Stewart Island, New Zealand, had dogs
descended from the Siberian dogs used on the Newnes-Borchgrevink
expedition, and I cabled to him to supply as many as he could up
to forty. He was only able to let me have nine, but this team
proved quite sufficient for the purposes of the expedition, as
the arrival of pups brought the number up to twenty-two during
the course of the work in the south.</p>
<p>The equipment of a polar expedition on the scientific side
involved the expenditure of a large sum of money and I felt the
pinch of necessary economies in this branch. I approached the
Royal Society with a view to securing the loan of the Eschenhagen
magnetic instruments that had been used by the <i>Discovery</i>,
but that body was unable to lend them, as they had been promised
in connection with some other work. I was lent three chronometer
watches by the Royal Geographical Society, which very kindly had
them thoroughly overhauled and examined. I bought one chronometer
watch, and three wardens of the Skinners' Company gave me one
which proved the most accurate of all and was carried by me on
the journey towards the Pole.</p>
<p>The Geographical Society was able to send forward an
application made by me for the loan of some instruments and
charts from the Admiralty, and that body generously lent me the
articles contained in the following list:</p>
<blockquote>3 Lloyd-Creak dip circles.<br>
3 marine chronometers.<br>
1 station pointer 6 ft.<br>
1 set of charts, England to Cape and Cape to New Zealand.<br>
1 set of Antarctic charts.<br>
1 set of charts from New Zealand through Indian Ocean to
Aden.<br>
1 set of charts, New Zealand to Europe <i>vi&acirc;</i> Cape Horn.<br>
12 deep-sea thermometers.<br>
2 marine standard barometers.<br>
1 navy-pattern ship's telescope.<br>
1 ship's standard compass.<br>
2 azimuth mirrors (Lord Kelvin's type).<br>
1 deep-sea sounding-machine.<br>
3 heeling error instruments.<br>
1 3-in, portable astronomical telescope.<br>
1 Lucas deep sea sounding machine.</blockquote>
<p>I placed an order for further scientific instruments with
Messrs. Cary, Porter and Company, Limited, of London, and amongst
other instruments I took the following:</p>
<blockquote>1 6-in. theodolite transit with micrometers to circle
and limb, reading to 5".<br>
1 electric thermometer complete with 440 yards of cable,
including recorder, battery, and 100 recorder sheets,
recording-drum to record every twenty-five hours.<br>
3 3-in. alt-azimuth theodolites, portable, complete with sliding
leg-stand.<br>
1 small observing sextant.<br>
6 explorers' compasses with luminous dial and shifting
needle.<br>
3 3-in. surveying aneroids with altitude scale to 15,000 ft.<br>
3 pocket aneroids.<br>
4 standard thermometers.<br>
12 deep-sea thermometers, Admiralty pattern.<br>
12 deep-sea registering Admiralty pattern.<br>
4 prismatic compasses (R.G.S.) pattern.<br>
1 portable artificial horizon, aluminium.<br>
2 small plane tables complete with alidade.<br>
2 barographs.<br>
2 thermographs.<br>
1 Oertling balance and one set of weights.<br>
1 Robinson anemometer.<br>
75 various thermometers.<br>
1 5-in. transit theodolite reading to 20" with short tripod
stand.<br>
15 magnifiers.<br>
1 pair night binoculars.<br>
1 pair high-power binoculars.<br>
Quantity of special charts, drawing materials and instruments,
steel chains and tapes, levelling staves, ranging poles,
&amp;c.<br>
2 microscopes.</blockquote>
<p>Amongst other instruments that we had with us on the
expedition was a four-inch transit theodolite, with Reeve's
micrometers fitted to horizontal and vertical circles. The
photographic equipment included nine cameras by various makers,
plant for the dark-room, and a large stock of plates, films and
chemicals. We took also a cinematograph machine in order that we
might place on record the curious movements and habits of the
seals and penguins, and give the people at home a graphic idea of
what it means to haul sledges over the ice and snow.</p>
<p>The miscellaneous articles of equipment were too numerous to
be mentioned here in any detail. I had tried to provide for every
contingency, and the gear ranged from needles and nails to a
Remington typewriter and two Singer sewing machines. There was a
gramophone to provide us with music, and a printing press, with
type, rollers, paper and other necessaries, for the production of
a book during the winter night. We even had hockey sticks and a
football.</p>

<br>
<h3>THE STAFF</h3>
<p><b>THE</b> <i>personnel</i> of an expedition of the character
I proposed is a factor on which success depends to a very large
extent. The men selected must be qualified for the work, and they
must also have the special qualifications required to meet polar
conditions. They must be able to live together in harmony for a
long period without outside communication, and it must be
remembered that the men whose desires lead them to the untrodden
paths of the world have generally marked individuality. It was no
easy matter for me to select the staff, although over four
hundred applications arrived from persons wishing to join the
expedition. I wanted to have two surgeons with the shore-party,
and also to have a thoroughly capable biologist and geologist,
for the study of these two branches of science in the Antarctic
seemed to me to be of especial importance. After much
consideration I selected eleven men for the shore-party. Three of
them only, Adams, Wild and Joyce, had been known to me
previously, while only Wild and Joyce had previous experience of
polar work, having been members of the <i>Discovery</i>
expedition. Every man, however, was highly recommended, and this
was the case also with the officers whom I selected for the
<i>Nimrod</i>. The names of the men appointed, with their
particular branches of work, were as follows:</p>
<p align="center">SHORE-PARTY</p>
<br>
<p class="margin2">LIEUTENANT J. B. ADAMS, R.N.R.,

<p>After the expedition had reached New Zealand and the generous
assistance of the Australian and New Zealand Governments had
relieved me from some financial anxiety, I was able to add to the
strength of the staff. I engaged Douglas Mawson, lecturer of
mineralogy and petrology at the Adelaide University, as
physicist, and Bertram Armytage as a member of the expedition for
general work. Professor Edgeworth David, F.R.S., of Sydney
University, consented to accompany us as far as the winter
quarters, with the idea of returning in the <i>Nimrod</i>, but I
persuaded him eventually to stay in the Antarctic, and his
assistance in connection with the scientific work, and
particularly the geology, was invaluable. Leo Cotton, a young
Australian, arranged to come south with us and help with the
preliminary work before the <i>Nimrod</i> returned to New
Zealand, and at the last moment George Buckley, residing in New
Zealand, accompanied us on the voyage south, returning in the
steamer that towed the <i>Nimrod</i>. The members of the ship's
staff, at the time when the <i>Nimrod</i> left Great Britain,
were as follows:</p>
<p class="margin2">LIEUTENANT RUPERT ENGLAND, R.H.R., master.<br>
JOHN K. DAVIS, first officer.<br>
A. L. A. MACKINTOSH, second officer.<br>
DR. W. A. R. MICHELL, surgeon.<br>
H. J. L. DUNLOP, chief engineer.<br>
ALFRED CHEETHAM, third officer and boatswain.</p>
<br>
<p>Captain England, whom I placed in command of the
<i>Nimrod</i>, had been first officer of the <i>Morning</i> when
that vessel proceeded to the relief of the <i>Discovery</i>
expedition, and had therefore had previous experience of work in
the Antarctic. Immediately before joining the <i>Nimrod</i> he
had been in the Government service on the west coast of
Africa.</p>
<p>Davis, first officer and later captain, had not been in the
Antarctic before, but he was a first-class seaman.</p>
<p>Mackintosh came from the service of the Peninsular and
Oriental Steam Navigation Company. He was transferred to the
shore-party at a later date, but an unfortunate accident finally
prevented his remaining in the Antarctic with us. Dr. Michell,
the ship's surgeon, was a Canadian, and Dunlop the chief
engineer, was an Irishman. Cheetham, the third officer and
boatswain had served on the <i>Morning</i> and some of the men
had also Antarctic experience.</p>
<p>After the <i>Nimrod</i> reached New Zealand, A. E. Harbord, an
Englishman, joined as second officer in place of Mackintosh, whom
I intended to transfer to the shore-party.</p>

<br>
<h3>THE FIRST STAGE</h3>
<p><b>THE</b> work of preparing for the expedition made rapid
progress towards completion, and as the end of July approached,
the stores and equipment were stowed away in the holds of the
<i>Nimrod</i> in readiness for the voyage to New Zealand. The
final departure for the south was to be made from Lyttelton, a
well-equipped port at which I felt sure, from the experience of
the three vessels of the <i>Discovery</i> expedition, that I
should receive every assistance that lay in the power of the
authorities. Early in July we exhibited in a room in Regent
Street samples of our stores and equipment, and some thousands of
people paid us a visit. The days were all too short, for scores
of details demanded attention and small difficulties of all sorts
had to be overcome, but there were no delays, and on July 30,
1907, the <i>Nimrod</i> was able to sail from the East India
Docks for Torquay, the first stage of the journey of sixteen
thousand miles to New Zealand. Most of the members of the shore
staff, including myself, intended to make this journey by
steamer, but I left the docks with the <i>Nimrod</i>, intending
to travel as far as Torquay.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-pic002"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>2. THEIR MAJESTIES THE KING AND QUEEN INSPECTING THE
EQUIPMENT ON THE <i>NIMROD</i> AT COWES</small></p>
<p>We anchored for the first night at Greenhithe, and on the
morning of the 31st continued on our way to Torquay, landing Mr.
Reid at Tilbury in order that he might return to London for
letters. When he reached London that afternoon, he found at the
office a telegram from the King's equerry, commanding the
<i>Nimrod</i> to visit Cowes in order to enable their Majesties
the King and Queen to come on board and inspect the ship and
equipment on Sunday, August 4. Mr. Reid had considerable
difficulty in delivering this message to me, but the Admiral
Superintendent at Sheerness kindly despatched a tug which
overtook the <i>Nimrod</i> off Ramsgate, and conveyed the news
that an alteration in our plans was necessary. We sailed in the
night for Cowes, and on the morning of August I stopped for an
hour off Eastbourne in order to enable some of the supporters of
the expedition to pay us a farewell visit. On the Sunday we were
anchored at Cowes, and their Majesties the King and Queen, their
Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales, the Princess Victoria,
Prince Edward and the Duke of Connaught came on board. The King
graciously conferred upon me the Victorian Order, and the Queen
entrusted me with a Union Jack, to carry on the southern sledge
journey.</p>
<p>The <i>Nimrod</i> sailed for Torquay early on the following
morning, and arrived there on August 6. We drank success to the
expedition at a farewell dinner that evening, and on the morning
of Wednesday, August 7, the ship sailed for New Zealand, and
after calling at St. Vincent and Capetown, arrived at Lyttelton
on November 23, the voyage having occupied three months and a
half. Mr. Reid reached Australian waters a month ahead of the
<i>Nimrod</i>, in order to make the necessary arrangements and
meet the Manchurian ponies, and I arrived early in December, my
intention being to leave Lyttelton on January 1, 1908.</p>
<p>The people of New Zealand and Australia took a keen and
sympathetic interest in the expedition from the first. The
Commonwealth Government gave me &pound;5000 and the New Zealand
Government &pound;1000, and this sum of money placed me in a position
to increase the number of the shore-party, to add to the stores
and equipment in certain directions and to strengthen the ship
still further, which I could not afford to do earlier. The New
Zealand Government also agreed to pay half the cost of towing the
<i>Nimrod</i> down to the Antarctic Circle, so that coal might be
saved for the heavy work amongst the ice, and in many other ways
assisted us. The Postmaster-General of the Dominion had printed
off for us a small issue of special stamps, and constituted me a
postmaster for the period of my stay in the Antarctic, an
arrangement that much simplified the handling of the
correspondence sent back from the winter quarters with the
<i>Nimrod</i>.</p>
<p>The ponies were enjoying their holiday on Quail Island and
were becoming sleek and fat, and it was necessary that they
should be broken to handling and sledge-hauling. Mr. C. Tubman
undertook this work, with the assistance of Dr. Mackay, and there
were some exciting moments on the island. The ponies were very
wild, and more than once Mackay and Tubman had to make a rapid
retreat from the animal they were schooling at the time. The
white ponies, which later proved the most hardy, were the least
tractable, and there was one white pony in particular that was
left behind, because, though a splendid specimen physically, it
could not be brought to a reasonable state of docility in the
time at our disposal. I intended to take only ten ponies out of
the fifteen, having allowed a margin for losses on the voyage to
New Zealand, and Tubman and Mackay devoted their attention to the
most promising animals. All the ponies had names, although I do
not know from whom they received them, and we finally left New
Zealand with "Socks", "Quan", "Grisi", "Chinaman", "Billy",
"Zulu", "Doctor", "Sandy", "Nimrod", and "Mac".</p>

<br>
<small>3. THE MANCHURIAN PONIES ON QUAIL ISLAND, PORT LYTTELTON,
BEFORE THE EXPEDITION LEFT FOR THE ANTARCTIC</small></p>
<p>I had secured in London twenty tons of maize and ten
hundredweight of compressed Maujee ration for the feeding of the
ponies in the Antarctic. The maize was packed in about seven
hundred tin-lined, airtight cases, and the ration was in
one-pound, airtight tins. This ration consists of dried beef,
carrots, milk, currants and sugar, and it provides a large amount
of nourishment with comparatively little weight. One pound of the
ration will absorb four pounds of water, and the ponies were very
fond of it. We also secured in Australia ten tons of compressed
fodder, consisting of oats, bran and chaff. This fodder was
packed in two hundred and fifty small bales. I purchased for the
dogs one ton and a half of dog biscuits, and proposed to make up
their rations with seal meat.</p>
<p>The final preparations involved an enormous amount of work,
but by December 31 everything was ready, quarters were provided
on the <i>Nimrod</i> for the scientific staff by enclosing a
portion of the afterhold, and constructing cabins which were
entered by a steep ladder from the deckhouse. The quarters were
certainly small, in fact there was just room for the bunks and
nothing else, and they were promptly named Oyster Alley, for some
reason not on record. As the day of departure approached and the
scientists brought their personal belongings, the alley reached a
state of congestion that can hardly be imagined. The ponies were
to be carried on deck, and ten stout stalls were built for them.
The motor-car was enclosed in a large case and made fast with
chains on the after-hatch from whence it could be transferred
easily on to the ice when the occasion arose. The deck load was
heavy and included cases of maize, tins of carbide for the
manufacture of acetylene gas, a certain quantity of coal and the
sledges. The <i>Nimrod</i> was low in the water as a result, and
when we left Lyttelton the little ship had only three feet six
inches of freeboard. Some live sheep presented to us by New
Zealand farmers were placed on board the <i>Koonya</i>, the
steamer which was to tow the <i>Nimrod</i> to the south.</p>
<p>I had been anxious to have the <i>Nimrod</i> towed south in
order to save coal. The ship could not take in a large quantity
of coal after our provisions and equipment had been placed on
board, for she was considerably overloaded, and it was important
that there should be enough coal to take the ship through the ice
and back to New Zealand, and also to provide for the warming of
the hut during the winter. The Government of the Dominion
consented to pay half the cost of the tow, and Sir James Mills,
chairman of the Union Steamship Company, offered to pay the other
half. The <i>Koonya</i>, a steel-built steamer of about 1100
tons, was chartered and placed under the command of Captain F. P.
Evans. The wisdom of this selection was proved by after events.
The pressure of work was at this time tremendous, and I owed a
very great deal to the assistance and advice I received from Mr.
J. J. Kinsey, of Christchurch. Before my departure I placed the
conduct of the affairs of the expedition in New Zealand in his
hands.</p>
<p>December 81 was the last day of our stay in New Zealand, for
as I had stated when announcing the expedition, we were to leave
Lyttelton on the first day of the new year. The stores and
equipment were on board and were as complete as we could make
them, and I had written my final letters, both business and
personal. The ponies and the dogs were to be placed on board the
<i>Nimrod</i> early the following morning.</p>

<br>
<h3>LYTTELTON TO THE ANTARCTIC CIRCLE</h3>
<p><b>JANUARY 1, 1908</b>, arrived at last! Warm, fine, and clear
broke the morning of our last day in civilisation. Before sunset
we were to sever all ties with the outer world and more than a
year must elapse ere we could look again on the scenes familiar
to ordinary daily life. For me this day brought a feeling of
relief, after all the strenuous work of the previous year, though
the new work I was entering upon was fraught with more anxiety
and was more exacting than any that had gone before. We all
looked forward eagerly to our coming venture, for the glamour of
the unknown was with us and the South was calling.</p>
<p>My personal belongings were gathered out of the chaos of
papers and odds and ends in my office at the hotel; I knew that
the legacy of unanswered letters, requests for special stamps,
and the hundred and one things that collect under such
circumstances would be faithfully administered by Mr. Reid.
Orders had been given to Captain England to have all in readiness
for casting off at 4 p.m., and early in the afternoon most of us
were on board. It was Regatta day and Lyttelton was crowded with
holiday-makers, many thousands of whom had come to see the
<i>Nimrod</i>. All day the deck of our little vessel was thronged
by the general public, who evinced the greatest interest in
everything connected with the ship and her equipment. Naturally
the ten ponies, now safely housed in their stalls on the forward
deck, were a special attraction. Our nine dogs also claimed a
share of attention, although it was a gymnastic feat to climb
through the supports of the pony structure, stretching across the
decks, in order to reach the forecastle, where the dogs lay
panting in the hot sun. To the uninitiated the number and size of
the beams belonging to the pony structure seemed excessive, but
we knew we might encounter heavy weather which would tax their
strength to the utmost. The <i>Nimrod</i> was deep in the water,
for every available corner had been stowed with stores and coal
and, if we could have carried it, we would have added at least
another fifty tons to our two hundred and fifty; but the risk was
too great. Indeed I was somewhat anxious as to the weather she
might make, though I knew she was a good sea boat and had great
confidence in her. There were many whose criticisms were frankly
pessimistic as to our chances of weathering an Antarctic gale;
and as I stood on deck I could hear the remarks of these Job's
comforters. Such criticisms, however, did not disturb us, for we
were confident in the ship.</p>
<p>Oyster Alley was crammed with the personal belongings of at
least fourteen of the shore-party; it was the temporary resting
place for many of the scientific instruments, so that both
ingress and egress were matters of extreme difficulty. The
entrance to this twentieth-century Black Hole was through a
narrow doorway and down a ladder, which ushered one into almost
complete darkness, for the doorway was practically filled up with
cases, and the single narrow deck light generally covered by the
feet of sightseers. The shore party's fourteen bunks were crammed
with luggage, which also occupied the whole of the available
floor space. It was in this uncomfortable place that the spirit
of romance, the desire for the wind-whitened Southern Seas, and
the still whiter wastes of the silent Antarctic grew stronger in
the heart of George Buckley, as he sat there talking over the
days and doings before us, longing for a share in the work, even
though he might only go as far as the Antarctic circle. He knew
that time would not permit him to do more than this. Suddenly he
jumped up, came to me, and asked if I would take him as far as
the ice. I was only too glad to consent, for his interest in the
expedition showed that his heart was in our venture, and his
personality had already appealed to us all. It was 2 p.m. when
the decision was made, and the <i>Nimrod</i> was to sail at 4
p.m. He managed to catch a train to Christchurch, dashed into his
club, gave his power of attorney to a friend; slung his
toothbrush and some underclothing into a bag; struggled through
one seething crowd at Christchurch Station and another at the
wharf, and arrived on board the <i>Nimrod</i>, a few minutes
before sailing time equipped for the most rigorous weather in the
world with only the summer suit he was wearing: surely a record
in the way of joining a Polar expedition.</p>
<p>Time was passing quickly, it was nearing four o'clock and all
our party were on board save Professor David. I had seen him
earlier in the afternoon, struggling along the crowded wharf,
bending under the weight of one end of a long iron pipe, a
railway porter attached to the other. This precious burden, he
had informed me, when it was safely on board, was part of the
boring gear to be used in obtaining samples of ice from the Great
Ice Barrier; he had found it at the railway station, where it had
been overlooked. Doubtless he was having a last skirmish round in
case there was anything else that had been left, and just as I
was getting anxious, for I did not want to delay the departure of
the ship, he appeared. His arms were filled with delicate glass
apparatus and other scientific paraphernalia. As he was gingerly
crossing the narrow gangway he was confronted by a stout female,
of whom the Professor afterwards said: "She was for the shore,
let who would be for the Pole." They met in the middle of the
gangway. Hampered by the things he was carrying, the Professor
could not move aside; he was simply charged down by superior
weight, and clutching his precious goods, fell off the gangway on
to the heads of some of our party. Wonderful to relate nothing
was broken.</p>
<p>At one minute to four orders were given to stand by the
engines, at 4 p.m. the lines were cast off from the wharf and the
<i>Nimrod</i> moved slowly ahead. Cheer after cheer broke from
the watching thousands as we moved towards the harbour entrance,
with the Queen's flag flying at the fore and our ensign dipping
farewell at the stern. The cheering broke out afresh as we passed
the United States' magnetic survey ship <i>Galilee</i>. She also
was engaged in a scientific mission, but her lines were laid in
warmer climes and calmer seas. Hearty as was this send-off it
seemed mild compared to that which we received on passing the
pier-head lighthouse. The air trembled with the crash of guns,
the piercing steam whistles and sirens of every steamship in the
port; and a roar of cheering from the throats of the thirty
thousand people who were watching the little black-hulled barque
moving slowly towards the open sea. With our powerful ally, the
<i>Koonya</i>, steaming in front, and on each side passenger
boats of the Union Company carrying some six or seven thousand
persons, we passed down the Roads, receiving such a farewell and
"God-speed" from New Zealand as left no man of us unmoved. The
farewells were not over, for we were to receive one more
expression of goodwill, and one that came nearer to the hearts of
those of us who were sailors than any other could. Lying inside
the Heads were three of his Majesty's ships of the Australian
Squadron, the flagship <i>Powerful</i>, the <i>Pegasus</i> and
the <i>Pioneer</i>. As we steamed past the last-named her crew
mustered on the forecastle head and gave us three hearty cheers;
we received the same from the <i>Pegasus</i> as we came abeam of
her, our party of thirty-nine returning the cheers as we passed
each ship in turn. Then we drew abreast of the flagship and from
the throats of the nine hundred odd bluejackets on board her we
got a ringing farewell, and across the water came the sound of
her band playing "Hearts of oak are our ships", followed by "Auld
Lang Syne". We responded with three cheers and gave another cheer
for Lady Fawkes, who had taken a kindly interest in the
expedition.</p>

<br>
<small>6. THE <i>NIMROD</i> PASSING H.M.S. "POWERFUL", FLAGSHIP
OF THE AUSTRALASIAN SQUADRON, IN LYTTELTON HARBOUR</small></p>
<p>Shortly after passing the <i>Powerful</i> we stopped to pick
up our tow-line from the <i>Koonya</i>, but before doing this we
transferred to the tug-boat <i>Canterbury</i> the few personal
friends who had accompanied some of the members of the expedition
down the harbour. We then came close up to the stern of the
<i>Koonya</i> and hauled in the 4-in. wire cable she was to tow
us with. A 4-in. wire is measured not as 4 in. diameter, but 4
in. in circumference, and is made of the finest steel. We passed
a shackle through the eye at the end of this wire and shackled on
to the free ends of both our chain cables. We then let out thirty
fathoms of each cable, one on each side of the bow, and made the
inner ends fast round the foremast in the 'tween decks. This
cable acted as a "spring", to use a nautical term; that is to
say, it lessened the danger of the wire snapping if a sudden
strain were put upon it, for the cable hung down in the water
owing to its weight, even when the ship was being towed at seven
or eight knots. This operation being completed we signalled the
<i>Koonya</i> to go ahead and we were soon in the open sea. There
was a slight breeze and a small choppy sea. Before we had been
under way for an hour water began to come in at the scupper holes
and through the wash ports. This looked ominous to us, for if the
<i>Nimrod</i> was going to be wet in such fine weather, what was
she going to be like when we got a southerly gale! She moved
through the water astern of <i>Koonya</i> like a reluctant child
being dragged to school; she seemed to have no vitality of her
own. This was due to her deeply loaded condition, and more
especially to the seven tons of cable and the weight of the wire
on her bows dragging her nose down into the sea. No Antarctic
exploring ship had been towed to the ice before, but it meant the
saving of coal to us for a time when the tons saved in this
manner might prove the salvation of the expedition.</p>
<p>Night came down on us, and the last we saw of New Zealand was
a bold headland growing fainter and fainter in the gathering
gloom. The occupants of Oyster Alley, after a somewhat sketchy
meal in the wardroom, were endeavouring to reduce the chaos of
their quarters into some sort of order. The efforts of some of
the scientific staff were interrupted at times by sudden attacks
of seasickness, and indeed one would not have been surprised if
the seafaring portion of the staff had also succumbed, for the
atmosphere of the alley, combined with the peculiar motion of the
ship, was far from pleasant. A few of the members of the party
preferred to sleep on deck in any odd corner they could find, and
one man in particular was so overcome by the sea that for three
days and nights he lay prostrate amongst the vegetables and cases
of butter and carbide, on the unused forebridge of the ship. He
seemed to recover at mealtimes, and as his lair was just above
the galley, he simply appeared from under his sodden blankets,
reached down his hand, and in a plaintive voice asked for
something to fill the yawning cavern that existed in his
interior. Professor David was given Dr. Michell's cabin, the
latter taking up his abode in Oyster Alley. The cabin measured
about 5 ft. 10 in. by 3 ft., and as the Professor had nearly a
quarter of a ton of scientific instruments, books and cameras,
one can imagine that he had not much room for himself. The
wardroom of the <i>Nimrod</i> was about 12 ft. long and 9 ft.
broad, and as there were twenty-two mouths to feed there three
times a day, difficulties were present from the beginning of the
voyage. Dunlop's cabin came into service as the largest overflow
dining room, for it accommodated three people. Davis and
Mackintosh each found room for another hungry explorer in his
cabin. When the food arrived it was passed along to the outside
dining rooms first. Then people in the main room were served. All
went well that first night out, for there was comparatively
little movement, but later on the story of an ordinary meal
became a record of adventure. I took up my quarters in the
captain's cabin, and fluctuated between the bunk and the settee
for a resting-place, until the carpenter made me a plank bed
about four inches off the deck. We did not know that we were not
to take our clothes off for the next two weeks, but were to live
in a constant state of wetness, wakefulness, and watchfulness
until the <i>Nimrod</i> arrived in the neighbourhood of the
winter quarters.</p>
<p>Bad weather was not long delayed. As the night of January 1
wore on, the wind began to freshen from the south-west, and the
following morning the two vessel? were pitching somewhat heavily
and steering wildly. The <i>Koonya</i> signalled us to veer, that
is, to slack out thirty more fathoms on each of our two cables,
and with great difficulty we managed to do this. The ship was
pitching and rolling, flinging the cables from one side of the
deck to the other, and with our forty-year-old windlass it was no
light task to handle the heavy chains. Then I felt one of the
first real pinches of the stringent economy that had to be
practised from the inception of the expedition. How I wished for
the splendid modern gear of the <i>Discovery</i> the large,
specially built vessel that we had on the previous expedition.
During the afternoon the wind and sea increased greatly, and the
<i>Nimrod</i> pitched about, shifting everything that could be
moved on deck. The seas began to break over her, and we were soon
wet through, not to be properly dry again for the next fortnight.
The decks were flooded with heavy seas, which poured,
white-capped, over the side, and even the topsail yards were
drenched with the spray of breaking waves. Lifelines were
stretched along the deck, and it was a risky thing to go forward
without holding on.</p>
<p>Our chief anxiety was the care of the ponies, and looking back
now to those days, it remains a matter of wonder to me how they
survived the hardships that fell to their lot. That night I
arranged for a two-hour watch, 'consisting of two members of the
shore staff, to be always in attendance on the ponies. The pony
shelter had five stalls on the port side and five on the
starboard side of the deck, with the fore hatch between them. The
watch-keepers named this place "The Cavalry Club", and here in
the bleak and bitter stormy nights, swept off their feet every
now and then by the seas washing over the fore-hatch, the members
of the shore party passed many a bad quarter of an hour. They
bore all the buffeting and discomfort cheerfully, even as those
men of old, who "ever with a frolic welcome took the thunder and
the sunshine". Night in the pony-stables was a weird experience
with inky blackness all round, save only where the salt-encrusted
hurricane lamp, jerking to and fro, made a glimmer of light. The
roar of the tempest rose into a shriek as the wind struck the
rigid rigging, the creaking and swaying of the roof of the stable
and the boat-skids, which partly rested their weight on it,
seemed to threaten a sudden collapse with each succeeding and
heavier roll, and the seas crashed dully as they fell on board.
The swirling waters, foam-white in the dim rays of the lamp,
rushed through the stable and over the hatch, and even from the
bridge far aft, we could hear the frightened whinnies of the
animals, as they desperately struggled to keep their feet in the
water that flooded the rolling stables. Every now and then some
wave, larger and fiercer than the one before, would sweep the
decks, tear the mats from under the feet of the ponies, and wash
the watch-keepers almost under the struggling beasts. When the
bulk of the water had passed, the mats were nailed down again
with difficulty, and the two watchers resumed their seats on a
bag of fodder that had been fastened to the hatch. One can
imagine that after a two-hours' watch a rest was welcome. Oyster
Alley was wet enough, and the beds were soaking, while the
atmosphere was thick and heavy; but these conditions did not
prevent the wearied men from falling asleep after wedging
themselves into their bunks, lest some extra heavy lurch should
send them to keep company with the miscellaneous collection of
articles careering up and down the deck of the alley.</p>

<br>
<small>A. THE AUTUMN SUNSET</small></p>
<p>All during our second night out, the weather was so bad that
we kept going slow, having requested the <i>Koonya</i> to slacken
speed late in the afternoon. Next morning found us plunging,
swerving, and rolling in a high sea, with a dull grey stormy sky
overhead, and apparently no prospect of the weather becoming
settled. We were moving little more than a mile an hour towards
the south, and the ship seemed to be straining herself on account
of the heavy pull on her bows, and the resulting lack of
buoyancy. The weather moderated somewhat in the afternoon, and we
signalled the <i>Koonya</i> to "increase speed". By midnight the
improvement in the weather was much more marked. The following
morning, January 4, we set loose the carrier pigeon which one of
the New Zealand sailors had brought with him. We attached a
message to the bird, briefly describing our passage so far, and
hoped it would safely accomplish the three hundred odd miles to
the land. On releasing our messenger it made one or two wide
circles round the ship, and then set off in a bee-line towards
its home. We wondered at the time whether any of the albatrosses,
which were now fairly numerous about our stern, especially at
meal times, would attack the stranger, and we heard afterwards
that the pigeon had not reached its home.</p>
<p>The hope that we were going to keep finer weather was
dispelled in the afternoon, for the wind began to increase and
the rising sea to break on board again, and within a couple of
hours we were bearing the full brunt of another furious gale. The
sea-going qualities of the <i>Nimrod</i> were severely taxed, but
the little vessel rose to the occasion. As the gale increased in
vehemence, she seemed to throw off the lethargy, one might almost
say the sulkiness, which possessed her when she found herself
outward bound at the end of a tow-line, for the first time in her
strenuous life of forty years. Now that the tow-line, in the fury
of the gale, was but of little use, save to steady us, the
<i>Nimrod</i> began to play her own hand. It was wonderful to see
how she rose to the largest oncoming waves. She was flung to and
fro, a tiny speck in this waste of waters, now poised on the
summit of a huge sea, whence we got almost a bird's-eye view of
the gallant <i>Koonya</i> smashing into the turmoil ahead; now
dipping into the wave valleys, from which all we could discern of
our consort was in very truth "just a funnel and a mast lurching
through the spray".</p>
<p>As the afternoon wore on, those of us who were not still in
the clutches of sea-sickness watched the grandeur of the gale. I
shall always remember Buckley, who stood for hour after hour on
the <i>Nimrod</i>'s poop, revelling in the clash and strife of
the elements. Keen yachtsman that he was, his admiration was
aroused by the way the two ships battled with the storm.
Professor David also, hanging to the dripping rails, was
fascinated by the wild scene, and between the gusts, we spoke of
many things. Somehow or another the conversation turned to one's
favourite poets, and it is but natural that, under these
circumstances of stress and strain. Browning's verse was often
the subject of conversation. Night drew on, sullen and black, our
only light the lamp we steered by on the <i>Koonya</i>'s mast. We
could imagine the stalwart figure of that splendid seaman.
Captain Evans, as he stood on his spray-drenched bridge, alert,
calm and keen, doing his best to ease the little ship astern. We
had nothing but admiration for the consummate seamanship that
anticipated our every need and wish. All that night it blew
harder than ever; on the morning of the 5th, I told Captain
England to signal the <i>Koonya</i> and ask her to pour oil on
the water in the hope that it might help us. To a certain extent
I think it did, but not enough to prevent the heaviest seas from
breaking on board. I thought that the gale had reached its height
on the previous day, but certainly this evening it was much
stronger. The <i>Nimrod</i> rolled over fifty degrees from the
perpendicular to each side; how much more than that I cannot say,
for the indicator recording the roll of the ship was only marked
up to fifty degrees, and the pointer had passed that mark. Let
the reader hold a pencil on end on a table, and then incline it
fifty degrees one way, and back again till it reaches fifty
degrees on the other side, and he will realise the length of arc
through which the masts and deck of the <i>Nimrod</i> swung. It
was only natural, under these circumstances, that the sturdy
little ponies had their strength taxed to the utmost to keep
their footing at all. It was impracticable to sling them, for
they were only half broken, and the attempt to put a sling under
one drove it nearly crazy with fright. All we could do was to try
and soothe them, and the animals evidently appreciated the human
voice and touch. Buckley had a wonderful way with them, and they
seemed to understand that he was trying to help them.</p>
<p>Occasionally there were clear patches of sky to the south and
east between the squalls. We had sleet for the first time on
January 5, and the wind, ranging between west, south, and
south-west, was chilly for the height of summer, the temperature
being about 46&deg; Fahr. We passed large masses of floating kelp,
which may have torn from the islands to the south-west of us, for
at noon on January 5, we were still north of the fiftieth
parallel, a latitude corresponding to the South of England. Our
course lay practically south, for I wanted to enter the pack-ice
somewhere about the 178th meridian east, previous experience
having shown that the pack is less dense about that meridian than
it is further west. About 9 p.m. that night, during an extra
heavy roll, one of the ponies slipped down in its stall, and when
the ship rolled the opposite way, turned right over on its back,
as it could not regain its footing. We tried everything in our
power to get the poor beast up again, but there was no room to
work in the narrow stall, and in the darkness and rushing water
it would have been madness to have tried to shift the other
ponies out of the adjacent stalls in order to take down the
partition, and so give the poor animal room to get up itself. We
had perforce to leave it for the night, trusting that when
daylight came the weather might have moderated, and that with the
light we might be able to do more. It speaks wonders for the
vitality of the animal that in spite of its cramped position and
the constant washing of the cold seas over it during the whole
night, it greedily ate the handfuls of hay which were given it
from time to time. Every now and then the pony made frantic
efforts to get on to its feet again, but without avail, and
before the morning its struggles gradually grew weaker and
weaker. The morning of January 6 broke with the gale blowing more
strongly than ever. There was a mountainous sea running, and at
ten o'clock, after having made another futile attempt to get
"Doctor", as he was called, on his legs, and finding that he had
no strength of his own, I had regretfully to give orders to have
him shot. One bullet from a heavy service revolver ended his
troubles. During the morning the gale moderated somewhat, and at
noon we were in latitude 50&deg; 58' South, and longitude 175&deg; 19'
East.</p>

<br>
<small>7. THE TOWING STEAMER "KOONYA", AS SEEN FROM THE
<i>NIMROD</i>, IN A HEAVY SEA. THIS PARTICULAR WAVE CAME ABOARD
THE <i>NIMROD</i> AND DID CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE</small></p>
<p>During the afternoon of January 6, the wind increased again,
the squalls being of hurricane force, and the wind shifting to
between west and north-west. The <i>Koonya</i> ahead was making
bad weather of it, but was steaming as fast as practicable, for
with the wind and sea coming more abeam she was able to make
better headway than when she was plunging into a head sea with
the weight and bulk of the towing cable and the <i>Nimrod</i>
astern of her, factors in the situation that made the handling
and steering of the steamer very difficult.</p>
<p>The temperature of the air that day was up to 49&deg; Fahr., but
the sea temperature had dropped to 44&deg;. This continuous bad
weather was attributed by some on board to the fact that we had
captured an albatross on the second day out. It is generally
supposed by seamen to be unlucky to kill this bird, but as we did
it for the purposes of scientific collections and not with the
wantonness of the "Ancient Mariner", the superstitious must seek
for some other reason for the weather. By this time most of the
scientific staff had recovered from seasickness, so to employ
their time when they were not on pony-guard, meteorological
observations were taken every hour. There sometimes was an
inclination to obtain the temperature of the seawater from the
never-failing stream which poured over the deck, but to the
observers' credit this feeling was sternly suppressed, and the
more legitimate and accurate, if less simple means, that of
drawing it from over the side, was adopted. It is not at all an
easy operation to draw water in this way from the sea when a ship
is under way, and in our particular circumstances, the observer
often got premature knowledge of the temperature by the contents
of the bucket, or the top of a sea, drenching him. On this day we
began to feel the serious effects of the towing strain on the
ship. For days the sailors' quarters below the fore-deck had been
in a state of constant wetness from the leaking of the fore-deck,
and the inhabitants of Oyster Alley had come to the conclusion
that it might more suitably be named "Moisture Alley". But when
Dunlop, the chief engineer, came on the poop bridge that
afternoon and reported that the ship was making about three feet
of water in an hour, matters assumed a more serious complexion. I
had not expected that we would get off scot free, as the ship had
to endure a very severe strain, and was old, but three feet of
water in an hour showed that she was feeling the effects of the
towing very much. It was necessary to rig the hand-pump to help
the steam-pumps to keep the water under, and this became, as the
Professor remarked, the occasion for an additional scientific
instrument to be used by the shore-party. A watch was set to use
this pump, and two members of the staff worked it for two hours,
or as long as occasion demanded, and at the end of that time were
relieved by two more. The weather grew steadily worse, and by
midnight the squalls were of hurricane force. Even the mastheads
of the <i>Koonya</i> disappeared from view at times, and the
light we were steering by would only be seen for a few seconds,
and would then disappear behind the mounting wall of waters that
separated the two ships. A moderate estimate of the height of the
waves is forty-two feet. During the squalls, which were
accompanied by hail and sleet, the tops of the seas were cut off
by the force of the wind and flung in showers of stinging spray
against our faces, drenching even the topsail yards of the
<i>Nimrod</i>. Each green wave rushed at us as though it meant to
swamp the ship, but each time the <i>Nimrod</i> rose bravely,
and, riding over the seemingly overwhelming mass, steadied for a
moment on the other side as it passed on, seething and white,
baffled of its prey. All night there were squalls of terrific
force, and the morning of January 7 brought no abatement of the
storm. The seas now came on board with increasing frequency,
finding out any odd article that had escaped our vigilance and
survived the rolling of the ship. A sack of potatoes was washed
on to the deck, and the contents were floating in two or three
feet of water. But standing on the poop bridge I heard one of the
crew, in no way disheartened, singing, as he gathered them up,
"Here we go gathering nuts in May".</p>
<p>At noon we were in latitude 53&deg; 26' South and longitude 127&deg;
42' East. In the afternoon the weather moderated slightly, though
there was a heavy, lumpy sea. Albatrosses were becoming much more
numerous, especially the sooty species, the death of which, on
Shelvoke's voyage, inspired Coleridge's memorable poem. I noticed
one, flying low between the two ships, strike its wings against
the wire tow-line, which had suddenly emerged from the waves
owing to the lift of the <i>Koonya</i>'s stern upon a sea. The
weather became fairly moderate during the night and remained so
next morning, with the wind in the north-west. After the second
day out we had shifted the dogs from the forecastle head to the
fore bridge, and one of these in its struggles to get down on to
the main deck, strangled itself before we knew that it was in
trouble.</p>
<p>There was constant rain during the morning of January 8, but
it did not beat the sea down much, and during the evening, with
the wind shifting to the south-south-west the gale increased
again. It was so bad, owing to the confused sea, that we had to
signal the <i>Koonya</i> to heave to. We did this with the sea on
our starboard quarter. Suddenly one enormous wave rushed at us,
and it appeared as though nothing could prevent our decks being
swept, but the ship rose to it, and missed the greater part,
though to us it seemed as if the full weight of water had come on
board. We clung tightly to the poop rails, and as soon as the
water had passed over us we wiped the salt from our eyes and
surveyed the scene. The sea had smashed in part of the starboard
bulwarks and destroyed a small house on the upper deck, pieces of
this house and the bulwarks floating out to the leeward; the port
washport was torn from its hinges, so that water now surged on
board and swept away at its own sweet will, and the stout wooden
rails of the poop deck, to which we had been clinging, were
cracked and displaced, but no vital damage was done. The look of
disgust on the faces of the dripping pony watch-keepers, as they
emerged from the waterlogged "Cavalry Club", was eloquent of
their feelings. The galley was washed out and the fire
extinguished. This happened more than once, but so pluckily did
the members of the cooking-department work, that never during the
whole of this very uncomfortable time had we been without a warm
meal. This means far more than one is apt to think, for the
galley was only five feet square, and thirty-nine persons blessed
with extremely hearty appetites had to be provided for.</p>

<br>
<small>8. MOUNTAINOUS SEAS</small></p>
<p>In a large measure, this unbroken routine of hot meals, the
three oases of what I might call pleasure in the daily desert of
discomfort, was due to Roberts, who besides being assistant
zoologist to the expedition, was going to act as cook. Seeing
that the ship's staff would have more work to do than they could
well carry out in providing for the thirty-nine people on board,
he volunteered the first day out to assist the ship's cook, and
the result was that we were always provided with fresh bread and
hot cocoa and tea, Montague, the ship's cook, was ever at work,
though the galley was in a constant state of flood. The stewards,
Handcock and Ansell, worked wonders in getting the food across
the danger zone between the galley and the wardroom. Ansell, with
ten plates in one hand, overlapping one another up his arm, would
arrive safely at his destination, though his boots were often
filled with water on the way aft. Of course there were times when
he was not so successful, and he would emerge from a sea with his
clothes, hair, and face plentifully sprinkled with food. As a
rule the accidents occurred in the wardroom, after the arrival of
the food. The tablecloth, after two or three days, assumed an
&eacute;cru colour, owing to the constant upsetting of tea and coffee.
Some of the staff had perforce to take their meals standing, from
lack of seating accommodation, and the balancing of a plate of
soup when the ship was rolling heavily required skill and
experience. The meal was generally accompanied by the spurting of
seawater through the wardroom door, or through cracks in the
skylight, and the water washed to and fro unheeded until the meal
was ended, and the indefatigable Ansell turned his attention to
it. It was in the wardroom that I salved a small wooden case from
the water, and found that it contained a patent mixture for
extinguishing fires. The rooms of the ship's officers, opening
out of the wardroom, were in a similar state of dampness, and
when an officer finished his watch and turned in for a
well-earned sleep, he merely substituted for clothes that were
soaked through, others which were a little less wet.</p>
<p>The water, however, did not damp the spirits of those on
board, for nearly every night extemporary concerts were held, and
laughter and mirth filled the little wardroom. It is usual on
Saturday nights at sea to drink the toasts, "Absent Friends", and
"Sweethearts and Wives". I was generally at this time in the
after cabin or on the bridge, and if, as sometimes happened, I
had forgotten that particular day, a gentle hint was conveyed to
me by Wild or Dunlop starting a popular song, entitled
"Sweethearts and Wives", the chorus of which was heartily
rendered by all hands. This hint used to bring my neglect to my
mind, and I would produce the necessary bottle.</p>
<p>On January 10 we had a clear sky during the morning until
about ten o'clock, and then, with a westerly wind, the breeze
became heavier, and rain commenced. Most of us that day, taking
advantage of the comparative steadiness of the ship, managed to
wash our salt-encrusted faces and hair; we had become practically
pickled during the past week. About midnight we had a light wind
from the north-north-east, and the almost continual rain of the
previous twelve hours had flattened the sea considerably.</p>
<p>At noon, on January 11, we were in latitude 57&deg; 38' South, and
longitude 178&deg; 39' West, and during the day the wind and sea
increased again from the north-west. The nature of this
particular sea made it necessary for us to keep the ship away,
altering our course from south to south-east, and before midnight
the gale had reached its now customary force and violence. As I
was standing on the bridge at 2 a.m., peering out to windward
through a heavy snow-squall that enveloped us, I saw, in the
faint light of breaking day, a huge sea, apparently independent
of its companions, rear itself up alongside the ship. Fortunately
only the crest of the wave struck us, but away went the starboard
bulwarks forward and abreast of the pony stalls, leaving a free
run for the water through the stables. When we left port it was
our augean problem how best to clean out the stables, but after
the first experience of the herculean waves, the difficulty was
to try and stop the flushing of them by every sea that came on
board forward, and now not only every wave that fell on board,
but the swell of the ocean itself swept the stables clean. This
particular sea shifted the heavy starboard whaleboat from its
chocks, landing it almost amidships on top of the "Cavalry Club,"
and swept some of our bales of fodder down on to the main deck,
where they mingled with the drums of oil and cases of carbide
torn from their lashings. Our latitude at noon was 59&deg; 8' South,
and 179&deg; SO' East. The squalls of sleet and snow gave place later
to clearer weather with a mackerel sky, which was of special
interest to the meteorologists, as indicating the trend of the
upper currents of the air.</p>
<p>During the afternoon the strength of the expedition was
increased by Possum, one of our dogs, giving birth to six fine
puppies. The mother and family were found a warm bed on the
engine room skylight, where a number of our cases were stowed. We
signalled the happy event to the <i>Koonya</i> by flags, and
received Captain Evans' congratulations. Signalling by flags was
necessarily a somewhat slow operation, especially as the
commercial code of signals is not exactly adapted for this
particular sort of information, and we could see by the length of
time they took to verify each signal that they were at a loss as
to the subject-matter of our communication, the incident of a
birth naturally being farthest removed from their thoughts at
such a time. Whenever the weather moderated at all the two ships
always held short conversations by flags, and the Commander of
the <i>Koonya</i> used to make inquiries in particular after the
health of the scientific staff.</p>
<p>January 13 brought with it a gentle breeze from the eastward,
the heavy leaden sky broke into blue, flecked with light cirrus
clouds, and the day seemed warmer and more pleasant than any we
had experienced since we left Lyttelton, though the temperature
of the air and sea water were down to 34&deg; and 37&deg; Fahr.
respectively The warm sun tempted those who had not before been
much in evidence on to the poop deck, and the whole vessel began
to look like a veritable Petticoat Lane. Blankets, coats, boots,
bags that might once have been leather but which now looked like
lumps of dilapidated brown paper; pyjamas that had been intended
to be worn when the owners first came aboard the <i>Nimrod</i>;
books that had parted with their covers after sundry adventures
in dripping Oyster Alley, but whose leaves evinced the strongest
disinclination to separate; pillows of pulp that had once been
pillows of feathers; carpet slippers, now merely bits of carpet;
in short, all the personal belongings of each member of the
expedition, including their most sacred Penates and Lares, were
lying in a heterogeneous mass on the poop deck, in order that
they might dry. A few of us ventured on baths, but it was chilly
work in the open air, with the temperature only two degrees above
freezing-point.</p>
<p>Some of our party, who were old sailors, had not much
impedimenta to look after and to dry, the hard-won experience of
early days having taught them the lesson that the fewer things
you have to get wet, the fewer you have to get dry. Adams in
particular observed this rule, for he wore the flannel trousers
in which he came on board the ship at Lyttelton through all this
weather, allowing them to dry on him after each successive
wetting. He fondly clung to them throughout the period we were
navigating in the ice, and whilst working the ship at winter
quarters, and would doubtless have worn them on the ascent of
Erebus if they had not practically come to pieces.</p>
<p>We were now keeping a sharp lookout for icebergs and pack; we
had been steering a little more to the east, as I felt that our
delay owing to bad weather would give us little time for
navigation if we had to pass through much pack-ice, and a few
degrees more easting might perhaps give us a more open sea. The
meeting with the pack-ice was to terminate the <i>Koonya</i>,s
tow, and that also meant our parting with Buckley, who had
endeared himself to every man on board, from able seaman upwards,
and had been of the greatest assistance to us in the matter of
the ponies. It was due to his prompt action on one occasion that
the life of "Zulu" was saved. We decided to give a farewell
dinner to our friend that night, and Marston designed special
menu cards for the occasion. At noon this day we were in latitude
61&deg; 29' South, longitude 179&deg; 53' East. During the afternoon the
weather kept fine and we set some square sail. Occasionally
during the bad weather of the previous week we had put "fore and
afters" on to try and steady the ship, but the wind had carried
them away. The <i>Koonya</i> had done the same, with a similar
result. Our dinner that night was a great success, and it was
early in the morning before we turned in.</p>
<p>Next morning, January 14, we sighted our first iceberg, and
passed it at a distance of about two and a half miles. It had all
the usual characteristics of the Antarctic bergs, being
practically tabular in form, and its sides being of a dead white
colour. The sight of this, the first sentinel of the frozen
south, increased Buckley's desire to stay with us, and it was
evident that the thought of leaving our little company was not a
pleasant one to him. There was a remarkable belt of clouds across
the sky during the morning, and their direction indicated the
movement of the upper air, so the Professor and Cotton made
several estimates of the height of this belt of cloud to try to
determine the lower limit of the higher current. The mean
measurements were taken, partly with a sextant and partly with an
Abney level, to the edge of the belt of mackerel sky. The result
of the observations was that the height of this belt was fixed at
about thirteen thousand feet. The belt of cloud was travelling in
an east-north-east direction at the rate of about fourteen miles
an hour. The surface wind, at this time the longitude was blowing
lightly from the west. Our latitude at noon was 63&deg; 59' South and
the longitude 179&deg; 47' West, so we had crossed the 180th
meridian.</p>

<br>
<small>9. A TABULAR BERG OF TYPICAL ANTARCTIC FORM</small></p>
<p>During the afternoon we passed two more icebergs with their
usual tails of brash ice floating out to leeward. The sea had
changed colour from a leaden blue to a greenish grey. Albatrosses
were not nearly so numerous, and of those following the ship the
majority were the sooty species. The Cape pigeon and Wilson's
petrel were occasionally to be seen, also a small grey-coloured
bird, which is generally found near the pack, the name of which I
do not know. We called them "ice-birds". Another sign of the
nearness of the ice was that the temperature of the air and water
had dropped to 32&deg; Fahr. Everything pointed to our proximity to
the pack, so we signalled the <i>Koonya</i> that we were likely
to sight the ice at any moment. I also asked Captain Evans to
kill and skin the sheep he was carrying for our supplies, as they
would be much more easily transported when the time came to cast
off. The weather remained fine with light winds during the
night.</p>
<p>Next morning it was fairly thick with occasional light squalls
of snow, and about 9 a.m. we saw the ice looming up through the
mist to the southward. It seemed to stretch from south-west to
south-east, and was apparently the forerunner of the pack. Now
had come the time for the <i>Koonya</i> to drop us, after a tow
of 1510 miles&mdash;a record in towage for a vessel not built for
the purpose. Before the <i>Koonya</i> finally cast off from us,
she had achieved another record, by being the first steel vessel
to cross the Antarctic Circle.</p>
<p>About 10 a.m. I decided to send Captain England across to the
<i>Koonya</i> with Buckley and the mail. Our letters were all
stamped with the special stamp given by the New Zealand
Government. The sea was rising again, and the wind increasing, so
we lost no time in making the necessary communication by boat
between the two ships. During a favourable roll the whale-boat
was dropped into the water, and Buckley, with his weekend
handbag, jumped into her. We gave him three cheers as the boat
pushed off on its boisterous journey to the <i>Koonya</i>. With
his usual forethought, to make matters lighter for the boat crew,
Captain Evans had floated a line astern, attached to a life-buoy,
and after about twenty-five minutes' hard pulling against wind
and sea, the buoy was picked up, and the boat hauled alongside
the steamer. I was glad to see the boat coming back again shortly
afterwards, for the wind kept increasing and the sea was rising
every moment, but in a lull, after pouring oil on the water, we
hauled the boat up safely.</p>
<p>A thin line had been brought back from the <i>Koonya</i>, and
at a signal from us Captain Evans paid out a heavier one, which
we hauled on board. He then manoeuvred his ship, so as to get her
as near as possible to us, in order that we might haul the
carcases of the sheep on board. Ten of these were lashed on the
line, and by dint of pulling hard, we got them on board.
Meanwhile the greater part of our crew were working the
old-fashioned windlass, getting in slowly, link by link, the
port-towing cable, whilst the <i>Koonya</i> took in as much of
her wire hawser as she conveniently could. Our heavy line was
carried away, owing to a sudden strain, before we received the
second instalment of waterlogged mutton. Captain Evans brought
the <i>Koonya</i> round our stern, and a heaving-line, to which
the sheep were attached, was thrown on board, but as soon as we
began to haul on it, it broke, and we had the chagrin of seeing
our fresh mutton floating away on the billows. It was lost to
sight shortly afterwards, but we could locate its position by the
albatrosses hovering above, doubtless surprised and delighted
with this feast.</p>

<small>11. THE <i>NIMROD</i> PUSHING THROUGH HEAVY PACK-ICE ON
HER WAY SOUTH</small></p>
<p>About a quarter to one Captain Evans signalled that he was
going to cut his hawser, for in the rising sea the two vessels
were in dangerous proximity to each other. We saw the axe rise
and fall, rise and fall again, and the tie was severed. The
<i>Koonya</i>' s work was done, and the <i>Nimrod</i> was
dependent on her own resources at last. Our consort steamed round
us, all hands on both ships cheering, then her bows were set
north and she vanished into a grey, snowy mist, homeward bound.
We spent a long afternoon struggling to get on board the one
hundred and forty fathoms of cable and thirty fathoms of wire
that were hanging from our bows. The windlass was worked by means
of levers, and all hands were divided into two parties, one
section manning the port levers, the other the starboard. All
that afternoon, and up to seven o'clock in the evening, they
unremittingly toiled at getting the cable in link by link. At
last we were able to proceed, the ship's head was put due south,
and we prepared to work our way through the floating belt of pack
that guards the approach to the Ross Sea. The weather had
cleared, and we passed the ice which we had seen in the morning.
It was a fairly loose patch of what appeared to be thick land
ice. We gradually made our way through similar streams of ice and
small hummocky bergs, most of them between forty and fifty feet
in height, but a few reaching a hundred feet.</p>
<p>By 2 a.m. on the morning of January 16, the bergs were much
more numerous; perhaps they could hardly be classed as bergs, for
their average height was only about twenty feet, and I am of
opinion, from what I saw later, that this ice originally formed
part of an ice-foot from some coastline. None of the ice that we
passed through at this time had the slightest resemblance to
ordinary pack-ice. About 3 a.m., we entered an area of tabular
bergs, varying from eighty to one hundred and fifty feet in
height, and all the morning we steamed in beautiful weather with
a light northerly wind, through the lanes and streets of a
wonderful snowy Venice. Tongue and pen fail in attempting to
describe the magic of such a scene. As far as the eye could see
from the crow's-nest of the <i>Nimrod</i>, the great, white,
wall-sided bergs stretched east, west and south, making a
striking contrast with the lanes of blue-black water between
them. A stillness, weird and uncanny, seemed to have fallen upon
everything when we entered the silent water streets of this vast
unpeopled white city. Here there was no sign of life, except when
one of the little snow petrels, invisible when flying across the
glistening bergs, flashed for a moment into sight, as it came
against the dark water, its pure white wings just skimming the
surface. The threshing of our screw raised a small wave astern of
the ship, and at times huge masses of ice and snow from the
bergs, disturbed by the unaccustomed motion, fell thundering in
our wake. Some of these bergs had been weathered into the
fantastic shapes more characteristic of the Arctic regions, and
from peak and spire flashed out the new caught rays of the
morning sun. Beautiful as this scene was, it gave rise to some
anxiety in my mind, for I knew that if we were caught in a breeze
amidst this maze of floating ice, it would go hard with us.
Already an ominous dark cloud was sweeping down from the north,
and a few flakes of falling snow heralded the approach of the
misty northerly wind. I was unfeignedly thankful, when, about
three in the afternoon, I saw from the crow's-nest open water
ahead. A few more turnings and twistings through the devious
water lanes, and we entered the ice free Ross Sea. This was the
first time that a passage had been made into the Ross Sea without
the vessel having been held up by pack-ice. I think our success
was due to the fact that we were away to the eastward of the
pack, which had separated from the land and the Barrier, and had
drifted in a north-west direction. All my experience goes to
prove that the easterly route is the best. Behind us lay the long
line of bergs through which we had threaded our way for more than
eighty miles from north to south, and which stretched east and
west for an unknown distance, but far enough for me to say
without exaggeration that there must have been thousands of these
floating masses of ice. Whence they had come was open to
conjecture; it was possible for them to have drifted from a
barrier edge to the eastward of King Edward VII Land. If that
were so, the barrier must be much lower than the Great Ice
Barrier, and also much more even in height, for the vast majority
of the bergs we passed were not more than one hundred and thirty
feet high, and seemed to be of a fairly uniform thickness. The
lights and shadows on the bergs to the eastward at times almost
gave them the appearance of land, but as they were congregated
most thickly in this direction, we did not venture to make closer
acquaintance with them. Of one thing I am certain, this ice had
not long left the parent barrier or coastline, for there was no
sign of weathering or wind action on the sides; and if they had
been afloat for even a short period they must infallibly have
shown some traces of weathering, as the soft snow was at least
fifteen to twenty feet thick. This was apparent when pieces broke
off from the bergs, and in one or two cases, where sections had
been sheared off the top of particular bergs, evidently by
collision with their fellows. There were no indications or signs
of embedded rocks or earthy material on the bergs, so I am led to
believe that this great mass of ice must have been set free only
a short time previously from some barrier edge at no great
distance. Our latitude at noon on the 16th was 68&deg; 6' South, and
the longitude 179&deg; 21' West.</p>

<br>
<small>12. PANCAKE ICE IN THE ROSS SEA</small></p>
<p>Before we entered the actual line of bergs a couple of seals
appeared on the floe-ice. I did not see them myself, but from
descriptions I gathered that one was a crabeater, and the other a
Weddell seal. A few of the Adelie penguins were observed also,
and their quaint walk and insatiable curiosity afforded great
amusement to our people, the surprise of the birds on seeing the
ship was so thoroughly genuine. Marston, our artist, whose sense
of the ludicrous is very fully developed, was in ecstasies at
their solemn astonishment and profound concern, and at the way
they communicated their feelings to one another by flapping their
makeshift wings, craning their necks forward with ruffled
feathers, and uttering short squawks. Marston's imitation of the
penguin was perfect, and he and the rest of us always responded
eagerly to the call on deck whenever we were passing a group of
these polar inhabitants.</p>
<p>When we were clear of the icebergs a distinct swell was felt
coming from the south, and for once the movement of the ocean was
welcome to us, for it showed that we might expect open water
ahead. I was fairly confident that we had managed to elude the
pack, and without doubt for a ship, well found and capable of
fair speed, the passage between the bergs on the meridian down
which we steered is preferable to the slower progress through the
ordinary pack farther west. I doubt if I would, except under
similar circumstances, when time and coal were very precious,
risk an old vessel like the <i>Nimrod</i>, which steams but
slowly in this labyrinth of heavy ice, but a faster vessel could
make the passage with safety. It may be that in future seasons
the Antarctic Ocean in this particular part will be found to be
quite ice-free, and a later expedition may be able to work more
to the eastward, and solve the riddle as to the existence of land
in that neighbourhood.</p>

<small>13. FLIGHT OF ANTARCTIC PETRELS</small></p>
<p>It was fortunate that we cleared the ice that afternoon, for
shortly afterwards the wind increased from the north, and the
weather became thick with falling snow.</p>
<p>The temperature was just at freezing-point, and the snow
melted on the decks when it fell. Altogether about an inch of
snow fell between 2 p.m. and midnight. We saw no ice until eight
o'clock next morning (January 17), and then only one small berg.
The wind shifted to the south-east, the sky cleared somewhat, and
with an open horizon all round we observed no sign of ice at
all.</p>

<h3>THE ATTEMPT TO REACH KING EDWARD VII LAND</h3>
<p><b>WE</b> were now in the Ross Sea, and it was evident that we
had avoided the main pack. Our position at noon was 70&deg; 43' South
latitude, and 178&deg; 58' East longitude. We were now steering a
little more westerly, so as to strike the Barrier well to the
east of Barrier Inlet, and also to avoid the heavy pack that
previous expeditions had encountered to the east of meridian 160&deg;
West, where the ice has always proved impenetrable. In the
afternoon the wind blew fresh, and the sky became overcast again,
and snow began to fall. This snow differed from that brought by
the northerly wind; the northerly snow had consisted of flakes
about a quarter of an inch in diameter, while that now met with
was formed of small round specks, hard and dry, like
sago&mdash;the true Antarctic type. Birds now became more
numerous. Large numbers of Antarctic petrels circled round and
round the ship. Their numbers were so great that as the flights
passed close by, the whirring of the wings could be distinctly
heard on board.</p>

<br>
<small>14. PUSHING THROUGH HEAVY FLOES IN THE ROSS SEA. THE DARK
LINE ON THE HORIZON IS A "WATER-SKY", AND INDICATES THE EXISTENCE
OF OPEN SEA</small></p>
<p>Towards evening we began to pass a number of small floe-bergs
and pack-ice. We could not see very far ahead, as the weather was
thick, so we steered more to the west to skirt this mass of ice.
One berg had evidently been overturned, and also showed signs of
having been aground. The Adelie penguins had become much more
numerous, and we saw an occasional seal, but too far off to
distinguish the species. During the early hours of January 18 we
passed a few large bergs, and as morning progressed the wind
increased, ranging between south by west and south by east. The
ship was pitching to a short sea, and as the water coming on
board froze on deck, and in the stables, we made shift to keep it
out by nailing canvas over the gaping holes in the bulwarks.
Adams and Mackay were engaged in this very chilly job; Adams,
slung in a rope over the side, every now and then got soaked up
to the middle when the ship dipped into the sea, and as the
temperature of the air was four degrees below freezing-point, his
tennis trousers were not of much value for warmth in the
circumstances. When he got too cold to continue outside, Mackay
took his place, and between them they made a very creditable jury
bulwark, which prevented the bulk of the water rushing into the
stable. The wind continued with a force of about forty miles an
hour, up till midday of the 19th, when it began to take off a
little, and the sky broke blue to the north-east; the decks were
thickly coated with soft ice, and the fresh water-pumps had
frozen up hard.</p>
<p>We were now revelling in the indescribable freshness of the
Antarctic that seems to permeate one's being, and which must be
responsible for that longing to go again which assails each
returned explorer from polar regions. Our position at noon on
January 19 was latitude 73&deg; 44' South and longitude 177&deg; 19'
East. The wind had decreased somewhat by midnight, and though the
air remained thick and the sky overcast during the whole of the
20th, the weather was better. We passed through occasional masses
of floating ice and large tabular bergs, and at noon were in
latitude 74&deg; 45' South, longitude 179&deg; 21' East.</p>
<p>On the 21st the weather grew clear, the temperature was
somewhat higher, and the wind light. We observed small flights of
snow petrels and Antarctic petrels, and saw a single giant petrel
for the first time. There were also several whales spouting in
the distance. The same sort of weather continued throughout the
day, and similar weather, though somewhat clearer, was
experienced on the 22nd. On the morning of the 23rd we saw some
very large icebergs, and towards evening these increased in
number. They were evidently great masses broken off the Barrier.
Early in the morning we passed a large tilted berg, yellow with
diatoms. On our port side appeared a very heavy pack, in which a
number of large bergs were embedded. Our course for these three
days was about due south, and we were making good headway under
steam.</p>
<p>We were now keeping a sharp look-out for the Barrier, which we
expected to see at any moment. A light south-easterly wind blew
cold, warning us that we could not be very far away from the
ice-sheet. The thermometer registered some twelve degrees of
frost, but we hardly felt the cold, for the wind was so dry. At
9.30 a.m. on the 23rd a low straight line appeared ahead of the
ship. It was the Barrier. After half an hour it disappeared from
view, having evidently been only raised into sight as an effect
of mirage, but by eleven o'clock the straight line stretching out
east and west was in full view, and we rapidly approached it. I
had hoped to make the Barrier about the position of what we call
the Western Bight, and at noon we could see a point on our
starboard, from which the Barrier dropped back. This was
evidently the eastern limit of the Western Bight. Shortly after
noon we were within a quarter of a mile of the ice-face, and
exclamations of wonder and astonishment at the stupendous bulk of
the Barrier were drawn from the men who had not seen it
before.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-pic015"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>15. TWO VIEWS OF THE GREAT ICE BARRIER. THE WALL OF ICE
WAS 90 FEET HIGH AT THE POINT SHOWN IN THE FIRST PICTURE, AND 120
FEET HIGH AT THE POINT WHERE THE SECOND VIEW WAS
TAKEN</small></p>
<p>We slowly steamed along, noting the various structures of the
ice, and were thankful that the weather promised to keep fine,
for the inlet to which we were bound could not easily have been
picked up in thick weather. The height of the Barrier about this
point ranged from a hundred and fifty feet to two hundred feet.
In the afternoon, about half past one, we passed an opening in
the Barrier trending in a south-easterly direction, but its depth
was only about three-quarters of a mile. The eastern point had
the form of the bows of a gigantic man-of-war, and reached a
height of about two hundred and thirty feet. It was appropriately
called "The Dreadnought".</p>
<p>As we steamed close in to the Barrier, watching carefully for
any sign of an opening, we were able to observe accurately the
various changes in the ice-face. In places the wall was perfectly
smooth, clean cut from the top to the waterline, in other places
it showed signs of vertical cracks, and sometimes deep caverns
appeared, which, illuminated by the reflected light, merged from
light translucent blue into the deepest sapphire. At times great
black patches appeared on the sides of the Barrier in the
distance, but as we neared them they were resolved into huge
caverns, some of which cut the waterline. One was so large that
it would have been possible to have steamed the <i>Nimrod</i>
through its entrance without touching either side or its top by
mast or yard. Looking at the Barrier from some little distance,
one would imagine it to be a perfectly even wall of ice; when
steaming along parallel with it, however the impression it gave
was that of a series of points, each of which looked as though it
might be the horn of a bay. Then when the ship came abeam of it,
one would see that the wall only receded for a few hundred yards,
and then new points came into view as the ship moved on. In some
places a cornice of snow overhung the Barrier top, and again in
others the vertical cracks had widened so that some portions of
the ice-wall seemed in immediate danger of falling. The vagaries
of light and shadow made appearances very deceptive. One inlet we
passed had the sides thrown up in little hummocks, not more than
ten or fifteen feet high, but until we were fairly close, these
irregularities had the appearance of hills.</p>
<p>The weather continued fine and calm. During the voyage of the
<i>Discovery</i> we always encountered a strong westerly current
along the Barrier, but there was absolutely no sign of this here,
and the ship was making a good five knots. To the northward of us
lay a very heavy pack, interspersed with large icebergs, one of
which was over two miles long and one hundred and fifty feet
high. This pack-ice was much heavier and more rugged than any we
had encountered on the previous expedition. Evidently there must
have been an enormous breaking away of ice to the eastward, for
as far as we could see from the crow's-nest, to the north and
east, this ice continued.</p>

<br>
<small>16. THE <i>NIMROD</i> PUSHING HER WAY THROUGH MORE OPEN
PACK TOWARDS KING EDWARD VII LAND</small></p>
<p>About midnight we suddenly came to the end of a very high
portion of the Barrier, and found as we followed round that we
were entering a wide shallow bay. This must have been the inlet
where Borchgrevink landed in 1900, but it had greatly changed
since that time. He describes the bay as being a fairly narrow
inlet. On our way east in the <i>Discovery</i> in 1902 we passed
an inlet somewhat similar, but we did not see the western end as
it was obscured by fog at the time. There seemed to be no doubt
that the Barrier had broken away at the entrance of this bay or
inlet, and so had made it much wider and less deep than it was in
previous years. About half a mile down the bay we reached fast
ice. It was now about half-past twelve at night, and the
southerly sun shone in our faces. Our astonishment was great to
see beyond the six or seven miles of flat bay ice, which was
about five or six feet thick, high rounded ice cliffs, with
valleys between, running in an almost east and west direction.
About four miles to the south we saw the opening of a large
valley, but could not say where it led. Due south of us, and
rising to a height of approximately eight hundred feet, were
steep and rounded cliffs, and behind them sharp peaks. The
southerly sun being low these heights threw shadows which, for
some time, had the appearance of bare rocks. Two dark patches in
the face of one of the further cliffs had also this appearance,
but a careful observation taken with a telescope showed them to
be caverns. To the east rose a long snow slope which cut the
horizon at the height of about three hundred feet. It had every
appearance of ice-covered land, but we could not stop then to
make certain, for the heavy ice and bergs lying to the northward
of us were setting down into the bay, and I saw that if we were
not to be beset it would be necessary to get away at once. All
round us were numbers of great whales showing their dorsal fins
as they occasionally sounded, and on the edge of the bay-ice half
a dozen Emperor penguins stood lazily observing us. We named this
place the Bay of Whales, for it was a veritable playground for
these monsters.</p>

<br>
<small>D4. BARRIER INLET: DOTTED LINE SNOWS POSITION OF ICE IN
1902</small></p>
<p>We tried to work to the eastward so as once more to get close
to the Barrier which we could see rising over the top of the
small bergs and pack-ice, but we found this impossible, and so
struck northwards through an open lead and came south to the
Barrier again about 2 a.m. on the 24th. We coasted eastward along
the wall of ice, always on the lookout for the inlet. The
lashings had been taken off the motor-car, and the tackle rigged
to hoist it out directly we got alongside the ice-foot, to which
the <i>Discovery</i> had been moored; for in Barrier Inlet we
proposed to place our winter quarters.</p>
<p>I must leave the narrative for a moment at this point and
refer to the reasons that made me decide on this inlet as the
site for the winter quarters. I knew that Barrier Inlet was
practically the beginning of King Edward VII Land, and that the
actual bare land was within an easy sledge journey of that place,
and it had the great advantage of being some ninety miles nearer
to the South Pole than any other spot that could be reached with
the ship. A further point of importance was that it would be an
easy matter for the ship on its return to us to reach this part
of the Barrier, whereas King Edward VII Land itself might quite
conceivably be unattainable if the season was adverse. Some of my
<i>Discovery</i> comrades had also considered Barrier Inlet a
good place at which to winter. After thinking carefully over the
matter I had decided in favour of wintering on the Barrier
instead of on actual land, and on the <i>Koonya</i>'s departure I
had sent a message to the headquarters of the expedition in
London to the effect that, in the event of the <i>Nimrod</i> not
returning at the usual time in 1908, no steps were to be taken to
provide a relief ship to search for her in 1909, for it was only
likely under those circumstances that she was frozen in; but that
if she did not turn up with us in 1909, then the relief
expedition should start in December of that year. The point to
which they should first direct their search was to be Barrier
Inlet, and if we were not found there they were to search the
coast of King Edward VII Land. I had added that it would only be
by stress of most unexpected circumstances that the ship would be
unable to return to New Zealand.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-pic017"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>17. TWO INLETS IN THE GREAT ICE BARRIER</small></p>
<p>However, the best-laid schemes often prove impracticable in
Polar Exploration, and within a few hours our first plan was
found impossible of fulfilment. Within thirty-six hours a second
arrangement had to be abandoned. We were steaming along westward
close to the Barrier, and according to the chart we were due to
be abreast of the inlet about 6 a.m., but not a sign was there of
the opening. We had passed Borchgrevink's Bight at 1 a.m, and at
8 p.m. were well past the place where Barrier Inlet ought to have
been. The Inlet had disappeared, owing to miles of the Barrier
having calved away, leaving a long wide bay joining up with
Borchgrevink's Inlet, and the whole was now merged into what we
had called the Bay of Whales. This was a great disappointment to
us, but we were thankful that the Barrier had broken away before
we had made our camp on it. It was bad enough to try and make for
a port that had been wiped off the face of the earth, when all
the intending inhabitants were safe on board the ship, but it
would have been infinitely worse if we had landed there whilst
the place was still in existence, and that when the ship returned
to take us off she should find the place gone. The thought of
what might have been made me decide then and there that under no
circumstances would I winter on the Barrier, and that wherever we
did land we would secure a solid rock foundation for our winter
home.</p>
<p>We had two strings to our bow, and I decided to use the second
at once and push forward towards King Edward VII Land. Just after
8 a.m. on the 24th we turned a corner in the Barrier, where it
receded about half a mile, before continuing to the eastward
again. The line of its coast here made a right angle, and the ice
sloped down to sea-level at the apex of the angle, but the slope
was too steep and too heavily crevassed for us to climb up and
look over the surface if we had made a landing.</p>
<p>We tied the ship up to a fairly large floe, and I went down to
England's cabin to talk the matter over. In the corner where we
were lying there were comparatively few pieces of floe ice, but
outside us lay a very heavy pack, in which several large bergs
were locked. Our only chance was to go straight on, keeping close
to the Barrier, as a lane of open water was left between the
Barrier and the edge of the pack to the north of us. Sights were
taken for longitude by four separate observers, and the positions
calculated showed us we were not only well to the eastward of the
place where Barrier Inlet was shown on the chart, but also that
the Barrier had receded at this particular point since January
1902.</p>

<br>
<small>19. SNOW THROWN ON BOARD IN ORDER THAT THE EXPEDITION
MIGHT HAVE A SUPPLY OF FRESH WATER</small></p>
<p>About nine o'clock we cast off from the floe and headed the
ship to the eastward, again keeping a few hundred yards off the
Barrier, for just here the cliff overhung, and if a fall of ice
had occurred while we were close in the results would certainly
have been disastrous for us. I soon saw that we would not be able
to make much easting in this way, for the Barrier was now
trending well to the north-east, and right ahead of us lay an
impenetrably close pack, set with huge icebergs. By 10 a.m. we
were close to the pack and found that it was pressed hard against
the Barrier edge, and, what was worse, the whole of the northern
pack and bergs at this spot were drifting in towards the Barrier.
The seriousness of this situation can be well realised by the
reader if he imagines for a moment that he is in a small boat
right under the vertical white cliffs of Dover; that detached
cliffs are moving in from seaward slowly but surely, with
stupendous force and resistless power, and that it will only be a
question of perhaps an hour or two before the two masses came
into contact with his tiny craft between.</p>
<p>There was nothing for it but to retrace our way and try some
other route. Our position was latitude 78&deg; 20' South and
longitude 162&deg; 14' West when the ship turned. The pack had
already moved inside the point of the cliff where we had lain in
open water at eight o'clock, but by steaming hard and working in
and out of the looser floes we just managed to pass the point at
11.20 a.m. with barely fifty yards of open water to spare between
the Barrier and the pack.</p>
<p>I breathed more freely when we passed this zone of immediate
danger, for there were two or three hundred yards of clear water
now between us and the pack. We were right under the Barrier
cliff, which was here over two hundred and fifty feet high, and
our course lay well to the south of west, being roughly
south-west true; so as we moved south more quickly than the
advancing ice we were able to keep close along the Barrier, which
gradually became lower, until about three o'clock we were abreast
of some tilted bergs at the eastern entrance of the Bay of
Whales. There was a peculiar light which rendered distances and
the forms of objects very deceptive, and a great deal of mirage,
which made things appear much higher than they actually were.
This was particularly noticeable in the case of the pack-ice; the
whole northern and western sea seemed crowded with huge icebergs,
though in reality there was only heavy pack. The penguins that we
had seen the previous night were still at the same place, and
when a couple of miles away from us they loomed up as if they
were about six feet high. This bay ice, on which many seals were
lying, was cracking, and would soon float away, with one or two
large icebergs embedded in it.</p>
<p>Skirting along the seaward edge we came to the high cliff of
ice at the westerly end, and passed safely out of the bay at ten
minutes to four. We then continued to the westward, still having
the heavy pack to the north. One berg that we passed was a
temporary resting-place for hundreds of Antarctic and snow
petrels, and these took flight as we approached. About 6 p.m. the
pack-ice seemed to loosen somewhat, and by half-past seven, from
the crow's-nest, I could see a lead of open water to the north
through the belt of pack, and beyond that there appeared to be a
fairly open sea. About eight o'clock the ship's head was put
north, and we soon gained a fairly open sea, occasionally having
to make <i>d&eacute;tours</i> round the heavier packed floes, though we
were able to push aside the lighter pieces. At midnight, our
easterly progress was arrested by a line of thick conglomerated
pack, and we had to steer north for nearly an hour before we
could again set the course easterly. It is remarkable how limited
one's horizon is at sea, for from the crow's-nest, after passing
this belt of pack, there appeared to be open water for an
indefinite distance, yet by two o'clock we were up against the
rigid ice again. Low pack-ice is not visible at any great
distance, and one could not trust an appearance of open water,
even with the wide horizon obtained from the crow's-nest. All
night long we followed a zigzag course in the endeavour to
penetrate to the east, at times steering due west, practically
doubling on our tracks, before we could find an opening which
would admit of our pursuing the direction we desired to follow.
During the night it had been somewhat cloudy towards the south,
but about 3 a.m. it became quite clear over the Barrier, and we
saw to our disappointment that we had made hardly any progress to
the eastward, for we were at that hour only just abeam of the Bay
of Whales. About half-past seven in the morning we passed a huge
berg, nearly three miles in length and over two hundred feet in
height, and at eight o'clock the sea became much more open;
indeed, there was no ice in sight to the east at all. It was a
bright, sunny morning, and things looked much more hopeful as I
left the bridge for a sleep, after having been on deck all
night.</p>

<br>
<small>B. A QUIET EVENING ON THE BARRIER</small></p>
<p>When I came up again, just before noon on January 25, I found
that my hopes for a clear run were vain. Our noon observations
showed that we were well to the north of the Barrier, and still
to the westward of the point we had reached the previous morning
before we had been forced to turn round. The prospect of reaching
King Edward VII Land seemed to grow more remote every ensuing
hour. There was high hummocky pack interspersed with giant
icebergs to the east and south of the ship, and it was obvious
that the whole sea between Cape Colbeck and the Barrier at our
present longitude must be full of ice. To the northward the
strong ice blink on the horizon told the same tale. It seemed as
if it would be impossible to reach the land, and the shortness of
coal, the leaky condition of the ship, and the absolute necessity
of landing all our stores and putting up the hut before the
vessel left us made the situation an extremely anxious one for
me. I had not expected to find Barrier Inlet gone, and, at the
same time, the way to King Edward VII Land absolutely blocked by
ice, though the latter condition was not unusual, for every
expedition in this longitude up till 1901 had been held up by the
pack; indeed Ross, in this locality, sailed for hundreds of miles
to the northward along the edge of a similar pack on this
meridian. It is true that we had steam, but the <i>Discovery</i>,
or even the <i>Yermak</i>, the most powerful ice-breaker ever
built, would have made no impression upon the cemented field of
ice.</p>
<p>I decided to continue to try and make a way to the east for at
least another twenty-four hours. We altered the course to the
north, skirting the ice as closely as possible, and taking
advantage of the slightest trend to the eastward, at times
running into narrow culs-de-sac in the main pack, only to find it
necessary to retrace our way again. The wind began to freshen
from the west, and the weather to thicken. A little choppy sea
washed over the edges of the floes, and the glass was falling.
About five o'clock some heavy squalls of snow came down, and we
had to go dead slow, for the horizon was limited at times to a
radius of less than one hundred yards. Between the squalls it was
fairly clear, and we could make out great numbers of long, low
bergs, one of which was over five miles in length, though not
more than forty feet high. The waves were splashing up against
the narrow end as we passed within a couple of cables' length of
the berg, and almost immediately afterwards another squall swept
down upon us. The weather cleared again shortly, and we saw the
western pack moving rapidly towards us under the influence of the
wind; in some places it had already met the main pack. As it was
most likely that we would be caught in this great mass of ice,
and that days, or even weeks might elapse before we could
extricate ourselves, I reluctantly gave orders to turn the ship
and make full speed out of this dangerous situation. I could see
nothing for it except to steer for McMurdo Sound, and there make
our winter quarters. For many reasons I would have preferred
landing at King Edward VII Land, as that region was absolutely
unknown. A fleeting glimpse of bare rocks and high snow slopes
was all that we obtained of it on the <i>Discovery</i>
expedition, and had we been able to establish our winter quarters
there, we could have added greatly to the knowledge of the
geography of that region. There would perhaps have been more
difficulty in the attempt to reach the South Pole from that base,
but I did not expect that the route from there to the Barrier
surface, from which we could make a fair start for the Pole,
would have been impracticable. I did not give up the destined
base of our expedition without a strenuous struggle, as the track
of the ship given in the sketch-map shows; but the forces of
these uncontrollable ice-packs are stronger than human
resolution, and a change of plan was forced upon us.</p>

<br>
<h3>THE SELECTION OF THE WINTER QUARTERS</h3>
<p><b>IT</b> was with a heavy heart that I saw our bows swinging
round to the west, and realised that for a year at least we would
see nothing of the land which we had hoped to have made our
winter quarters. We turned to the westward about eight o'clock
that night, watching the ice carefully as we went along, and up
to one o'clock on the morning of January 26 there was not a break
in the close-set pack to the northward of us. We then lost sight
of the ice in the mist. The glass was unsteady, and the wind
somewhat gusty from the south-west, with a choppy sea. About six
o'clock on the morning of the 26th, the ship's head was put
south, for I wanted to pick up the Barrier and follow it along at
least as far as the Western Bight, before setting the course
direct for Mount Erebus. We passed the inlet we had seen on our
way east, and about twelve o'clock were abreast of the eastern
point of Western Bight. We now laid our course for Mount Erebus,
and as I hoped to examine the Barrier more closely in the
following year we made a direct course west, which took us some
distance off the edge of the ice. The weather was fine and clear,
excepting for a low stratus cloud over the Barrier; this lifted
later in the day, but before evening we had entirely lost sight
of the ice-face. There was an extraordinary absence of bird life
of any description, but whales were blowing all round us, some
coming right alongside the ship. We had so far seen fewer of the
snow petrels and many more of the Antarctic petrels than during
the previous expedition. On this day we saw one albatross of the
sooty species, and a couple of giant petrels. The wind was
westerly all day, and towards the evening there were one or two
slight snow squalls. Our position at noon on the 26th was
latitude 78&deg; 9' South, and longitude 178&deg; 43' West, and the air
temperature had risen to 28&deg; Fahr.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-pic022"></a><img alt=""
src="1202361h-images/hs-pic022.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>22. MOUNT EREBUS FROM THE ICE-FOOT</small></p>
<p>On the 28th, the weather kept fine, though the sky was
practically covered with cloud. A great arch of clear sky rose in
the south about noon; shortly before this a curious whitish
appearance gave one the impression of land, and as the sky
cleared this became more distinct, and proved to be Erebus and
Terror, the two huge mountains we were approaching. By 2 p.m.
they had grown much more distinct, and were evidently raised by
mirage to even statelier altitudes than their own. We could
plainly see the smoke from Mount Erebus, which from our point of
view showed to the south of Mount Terror. We altered the course a
little so as to make Cape Crozier. I had some thoughts of placing
a depot there to be handy for any party that might go over from
winter quarters to study penguin life, but on second thoughts
decided not to delay the ship. Our noon position put us in
latitude 77&deg; 6' South, and longitude 175&deg; 35' East. We passed
Cape Crozier, where the Barrier meets the land some distance off,
about ten o'clock that night. The weather was beautifully fine
and clear, and except for an occasional berg and a few pieces of
heavy floe, there was no ice visible. We steamed fairly close in
along the coast, and at 3 a.m. were abreast of Erebus Bay. To the
north-west of us was Beaufort Island, showing a precipitous rock
face on its eastern side; Cape Bird was just on our port bow. The
weather was overcast and snowy as we turned Cape Bird at 5.30
a.m. on January 29. We hoped to reach our new winter quarters
without more opposition from the ice. As we steamed down McMurdo
Sound we passed through occasional loose patches of pack-ice, on
which immense numbers of penguins were congregated.</p>
<p>There was a great deal more ice to the west, and a strong ice
blink gave indication that it must be heavily packed right up to
the western shore. Passing down the sound, and keeping well to
the east and close under the land, we observed a long, low sandy
beach, terminating landwards in a steep slope, the whole place
for an area of about two square miles yellow and pink with
penguin guano. It was a large penguin rookery.</p>
<p>We passed but little ice till about ten o'clock, but within an
hour after that we could see the fast ice ahead of us, and by
half-past eleven we were brought up against it. It was now
January 29, and some twenty miles of frozen sea separated us from
Hut Point, where we hoped to make our winter quarters. The ice at
the spot at which we were first stopped by it was very much
decayed and covered with about a foot of snow. We tried to break
through it by ramming, but the attempt was not a success, for the
ship entered about half her length into the sludgy mass, and then
stuck, without producing a crack in front. We backed out again,
and, when some little distance away, put on full speed, ramming
the ship up against the ice edge. This second attempt was equally
futile, so the ice anchor was made fast to the floe, while we
considered some better plan of action.</p>
<p>The weather had cleared somewhat, and we were able to see our
surroundings. To the south lay the Delbridge Islands, and beyond
appeared the sharp peak of Observation Hill under which lay the
winter quarters of the last expedition. Castle Rock, towering
above other local heights, seemed like an old friend, and White
Island was dimly seen beneath the rising pall of cloud. To the
south-west Black Island and Brown Island showed up distinctly,
and behind the former we could trace the rounded lines of Mount
Discovery. To the west were the gigantic peaks of the western
mountains with their huge amphitheatres and immense glaciers.
About seven miles to the eastward lay a dark mass of rock, Cape
Royds, named after the first lieutenant of the <i>Discovery</i>.
So familiar were they that it seemed as though it were only
yesterday that I had looked on the scene, and yet six years had
gone by.</p>
<p>During the day we had occasional falls of light, dry snow, and
the air temperature at times went down to 11&deg; Fahr, although this
was the height of summer. The wind continued southerly but with
no great force, and now we would have welcomed even a heavy
blizzard to break up the ice. A northerly swell would have been
better still, for a few hours of this would make short work of
the miles of ice that now formed an impenetrable bar to our ship.
When the S.Y. <i>Morning</i>, the first relief ship to the
<i>Discovery</i>, arrived about January 23, 1902, there was a
similar amount of ice in the sound, and it was not till February
28 that she got within five miles of Hut Point, and the ice did
not break out up to the Point at all during that year. The
following year, both the <i>Terra Nova</i> and the <i>Morning</i>
arrived at the ice-face about January 4, and found that the sound
was frozen over for twenty miles out from Hut Point. Yet by
February 15, the ice had broken away to the south of Hut Point,
and the <i>Discovery</i> was free. With only these two diverse
experiences on which to base any theory as to the probable action
of the ice, it will easily De seen that the problem was a
difficult one for me. If I kept the ship for two weeks in the
hope of the ice breaking up, and it did not do so, we would then
be in a very serious position, for it would take nearly a
fortnight to land all the stores and get the hut up, and this
could only be done after selecting new winter quarters somewhere
in the neighbourhood, either on the west coast or on one of the
bare patches of rocks lying to the eastward of us. The outlook to
the west was not promising, for about five or six miles to the
west of where we were lying the ice was heavily packed. To the
eastward it seemed more hopeful.</p>
<p>I decided to lie off the ice-foot for a few days at least, and
give Nature a chance to do what we could not with the ship, that
is, to break up the miles of ice intervening between us and our
goal. We seemed fated to meet with obstacles in every attempt we
made to carry out our plans, but remembered in these somewhat
anxious times that obstacles are the common lot of Polar
explorers, and that indeed the game would not be worth playing if
there were not difficulties. My chief anxiety was due to the fact
that each day's delay at the ice-foot would mean a diminution of
our scanty stock of coal, for it was necessary to keep up steam
that we might be ready to move at a moment's notice in the event
of the ice packing down on us from the north, or the breaking
away of the floe to which we were fast. The latter circumstance
indeed was a constant occurrence; either the ice broke bodily
away, or a slight breeze would catch the ship and draw the anchor
out of the floe. Then we had to steam up and get a fresh grip.
The plan of sledging the stores across the distance intervening
between us and Hut Point I soon dismissed as impracticable, for
even if the ponies had been in perfect condition, and it had been
possible to use the motor-car, we could never have shifted the
hundred and eighty odd tons of equipment in the time
available.</p>

THE SHIP COULD LIE THERE</small></p>

<br>
<small>24. THE <i>NIMROD</i> MOORED TO THE STRANDED BERG, ABOUT A
MILE FROM THE WINTER QUARTERS. THE <i>NIMROD</i> SHELTERED IN THE
LEE OF THIS BERG DURING BLIZZARDS</small></p>
<p>I was troubled at this time in regard to the health of Captain
England. He did not seem, at all well, and it was evident that
the strain of the bad weather we had encountered, and more
especially of the difficulties in the ice had told upon him. Our
circumstances at the time were not likely to afford him much
rest. He was naturally anxious to get the ship away as soon as
possible, as he felt that she could not be much depended on for
sailing, but I could not see my way to fixing an actual date for
the <i>Nimrod</i>'s departure, especially in view of the fact
that I did not even know where our winter quarters were to
be.</p>
<p>On the evening of January 29 we took the sides and top off the
motor-car case and put the wheels on the car, for I hoped to try
it on the floe. The member of the staff in charge was Day, who
soon had the engine running, and the following morning, the 30th,
though the temperature was low, it seemed to go without any
hitch. Its behaviour on the floe, where the snow was lying deep,
had yet to be tested. We put on the light wheels and Dunlop tyres
and the non-skid chains, for we had hopes that it might be
unnecessary to use the heavier wheels, and we wished to have
everything ready.</p>
<p>During the day a fresh breeze sprang up from the south-east
with drifting snow, and the vessel soon assumed a wintry
appearance. At meal times on this day everybody crowded into the
wardroom for warmth, as it was no longer possible to take one's
food standing by the galley door. The ship broke from her anchors
two or three times, and the ice to which she had been attached
drifted away to the north, and though the pieces were only about
a hundred yards long our hopes were raised, for we felt that the
ice was beginning to break up, though we realised that if only a
few hundred yards shifted in a day it would take too long for a
mass of ice twenty miles broad to go out, and enable us to get to
Hut Point in time to discharge her stores.</p>
<p>All day long Killer whales in large numbers had been rising
and blowing near the ice. They came right alongside the ship, and
every now and then we could see one rear itself on end and poke
its head over the ice-edge on the lookout for a seal. On one
occasion we saw a seal suddenly shoot out of the water on to the
floe-edge and hurry into safety with almost incredible speed for
an animal of such unwieldy proportions. It travelled at least a
quarter of a mile over the firm ice before pausing for breath. A
minute or two later the cause of this extreme haste became
evident, for the huge sinister head of a Killer slowly reared
itself out of the water and gazed round for its intended victim.
We have never seen a seal captured by one of these monsters, but
undoubtedly they must fall victims sometimes, for the Killer is
always hanging round the ice, poking his head up amongst the
loose floes, and the manifest alarm of seals lying there, and
their quick retreat to a more secure position away from the water
can only be explained as the struggle to escape from a known
danger. There were many Adelie penguins about, and it was amusing
to watch them forming up in line on the edge of the ice, and then
diving in turn into the sea, like swimmers in a handicap race. A
couple of minutes might elapse before they appeared again.</p>
<p>We unfastened most of the beams of the pony shelter, so that
there would be no difficulty in getting the ponies out at a
moment's notice, and removed a lot of the top hamper from the
skids. Most of the poor beasts were in bad condition. Those which
were white all over seemed, for some reason, to have stood the
rough weather better than the parti-coloured ones, but all were
enjoying the steadiness of the ship after the terrible rolling.
The flanks of most of the horses had been skinned by the constant
knocking and rubbing against the sides of their stalls, and Zulu
was in such a bad condition from this cause that I decided to
have him shot at once. This left us with eight ponies, and we
considered ourselves fortunate in reaching winter quarters with
the loss of only two animals.</p>
<p>So far the voyage had been without accident to any of the
staff, but on the morning of the 31st, when all hands were
employed getting stores out of the after hatch, preparatory to
landing them, a hook on the tackle slipped and, swinging suddenly
across the deck, struck Mackintosh in the right eye. He fell on
the deck in great pain, but was able, in a few minutes, to walk
with help to England's cabin, where Marshall examined him. It was
apparent that the sight of the eye was completely destroyed, so
he was put under chloroform, and Marshall removed the eye, being
assisted at the operation by the other two doctors, Michell and
Mackay. It was a great comfort to me to know that the expedition
had the services of thoroughly good surgeons. Mackintosh felt the
loss of his eye keenly; not so much because the sight was gone,
but because it meant that he could not remain with us in the
Antarctic. He begged to be allowed to stay, but when Marshall
explained that he might lose the sight of the other eye, unless
great care were taken, he accepted his ill-fortune without
further demur, and thus the expedition lost, for a time, one of
its most valuable members.</p>
<p>Whilst we were waiting at the ice I thought it as well that a
small party should proceed to Hut Point, and report on the
condition of the hut left there by the <i>Discovery</i>
expedition, for it was possible that, after five years' disuse,
it might be drifted up with snow. I decided to send Adams, Joyce
and Wild, giving Adams instructions to get into the hut, and then
return the next day to the ship. We were then about sixteen miles
from Hut Point, and the party started off the next morning with
plenty of provisions in case of being delayed, and a couple of
spades with which to dig out the hut. It was Adams' first
experience of sledging, and a fifteen or sixteen-mile march with
a fairly heavy load was a stiff proposition for men who had been
cooped up in the ship for over a month. They started at a good
swinging pace. The Professor and Cotton met the party some two or
three miles away from the ship, and accompanied them for another
mile. On their return they reported that the sledge-party had got
on to old ice that had not broken out the previous year. The ice
across which the party had started was about four feet thick, and
much more solid than that which stopped the ship on our first
arrival. It was one-year ice, but I think it quite possible that
it had broken out earlier and frozen in again.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-pic025"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>25. THE FIRST LANDING PLACE, SHOWING BAY ICE BREAKING OUT
AND DRIFTING AWAY NORTH</small></p>
<p>During the previous night we had moved somewhat further west
and tied up to the floe, after another ineffectual attempt to
break through to the south. Shortly after the sledge-party
started we hoisted the motor-car over the side and landed it
safely on the sea-ice. Day immediately got in, started the
engine, and off the car went with the throbbing sound which has
become so familiar in the civilised world, and was now heard for
the first time in the Antarctic. The run was but a short one, for
within a hundred yards the wheels clogged in the soft snow. With
all hands pushing and pulling we managed to get the car across a
crack in the ice, which we momentarily expected would open out,
and allow the floe to drift away to the north. Once over the
crack the engine was started again, and for a short distance the
car went ahead under its own power, but it was held up again by
the snow. By dint of more pushing and pulling, and with the help
of its own engine, the car reached a point about half a mile
south of the ship, but our hopes as to the future practical
utility of the machine were considerably damped. We could not
accurately judge of the merits of the car on this trial, for it
had not been fitted with the proper wheels for travelling in
snow, and the engine was not tuned up to working efficiency.
There was no difficulty with the ignition, for it sparked at
once, in spite of there being at the time 17&deg; of frost. We left
the car at one o'clock and went on board to lunch, and, on coming
back, found a couple of Adelie penguins on the ice solemnly
eyeing the strange arrival. More cracks had opened up near the
car, and as there was no prospect of it helping us to reach the
land at this time I decided to have it hauled back to the ship
and hoisted on board at once, to await a more favourable
opportunity for a thorough test. Ignominiously it was hauled
through the snow until it got within a hundred yards of the ship
where the ice was harder. Then, with a puff and a snort, it ran
up alongside. In the morning I had had dreams of mounting the car
with Day and gaily overtaking the sledge-party as they toiled
over the ice, but these dreams were short-lived.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we hauled our anchor in and steamed west to
have a look at the situation of the ice on the western coast, but
we had not gone four miles before we were brought up by ice, and
we returned to our old moorings. That evening most of our staff
tasted Skua gull for dinner for the first time, and pronounced it
delicious. The method of catching these birds was simple and
efficient, if not exactly sporting. A baited hook and line was
thrown on to the floe, and in a couple of minutes a Skua would
walk up to the bait and swallow it only to find himself being
dragged towards the ship.</p>
<p>His companions did not seem to realise that their comrade was
in any difficulty, but appeared to think rather that he had some
particularly dainty morsel of which they were being deprived, for
they at once proceeded to attack him in the hope of making him
disgorge. About ten or twelve Skuas were caught in this way
before they began to suspect that anything was amiss, but when
they did realise the situation, the lure of the most dainty bits
of meat proved ineffectual. In the afternoon we also killed a
couple of Weddell seals and next morning had bacon and fresh seal
liver for breakfast.</p>
<p>There was no perceptible change in the state of the ice on
February 2, though occasional floes were breaking off, and as the
weather kept fine a party consisting of Professor David, Mawson,
Cotton, Priestley and Armytage started off across the ice bound
for Inaccessible Island. I went out with England towards the
south on ski to examine the ice for cracks, but the result of our
walk was not at all satisfactory, for the ice was firm and the
only cracks were those alongside the ship. I therefore decided to
wait no longer at the ice-face, but, when the sledge-party
returned, to seek for winter quarters on the east coast of Ross
Island. Early in the afternoon a breeze sprang up from the
eastward, the sky became overcast, and a slight drift blew across
the fast ice. The loose ice drifted rapidly from the eastward, so
the ship was backed into clear water, and it was well that this
was done, for shortly afterwards the loose ice overrode the solid
floe and would have given the ship a nasty squeeze had she been
lying at her former moorings. On the wind springing up in the
afternoon, the recall flag had been hoisted as a signal to the
party ashore, but they did not see it, and it was nearly five
o'clock before they turned up. We had, by that time, remoored the
ship about a mile to the eastward of our former position. The
Professor reported that they had been unable to land on the
island, as about fifty yards of water intervened between the ice
and the bare land. They found a sea urchin on the ice, and Murray
at once claimed it for his collection. They had learned the first
lesson of the Antarctic, which is, that distances are very
deceptive, and that land is always much more distant than it
appears to be.</p>
<p>This evening we kept a look-out for the return of the sledge
travellers, but there was no sign of them by bedtime. I knew that
Adams would be sure to return unless his party had found much
difficulty in effecting an entrance into the hut. At half-past
one in the morning Harbord came down and reported that he could
see the party coming along in the distance. Of course at this
time we had perpetual daylight and there was practically no
difference between day and night. I had some cocoa and sardines
prepared for them, for I knew from experience how comforting is
this fare to a way-worn sledger. Adams, on his arrival, reported
that they had had a very heavy march on the way to the hut, and
had not reached it till a quarter to twelve at night, having been
going since 10 a.m. The surface for the last two miles had been
smooth ice, clear of snow, and a large pool of open water lay off
the end of Hut Point. The bay in which the <i>Discovery</i> had
been frozen in was covered with clear blue ice, showing that in
the previous season the sea-ice had not broken out. They were so
tired that they turned into their sleeping-bags inside the hut
directly they made an entrance, which was easily done through one
of the lee windows. They found the hut practically clear of snow,
and the structure quite intact. There was a small amount of ice
inside on the walls, evidently the result of a summer thaw, but
even after five years' desertion, the building was in excellent
preservation. A few relics of the last expedition were lying
about, including bags containing remnants of provisions from
various sledging-parties. Amongst these provisions was an open
tin of tea, and the following morning the party made an excellent
brew from the contents. It speaks volumes for the dryness of the
climate that the tea should retain its flavour after exposure to
the air for five years. A sledging-tin of petroleum was also used
and was found to be in perfect condition. The ice on the end of
Hut Point was cracked and crevassed, but in all other respects
things seemed to be the same as when the <i>Discovery</i> steamed
away to the north in February 1904. The cross put up in memory of
Vince, who lost his life close by in a blizzard, was still
standing, and so were the magnetic huts. At 1 p.m. the following
day the three sledgers set out for the ship, and though they had
the assistance of an extemporised sail, rigged to take advantage
of the southerly wind, they found the travelling very heavy, and
were heartily glad to get on board the <i>Nimrod</i> again.</p>
<p>In the morning we moved close in towards Inaccessible Island,
as the ice seemed to have broken out right up to it, but on
getting near we saw there was still a large amount stretching
between the ship and the island. Soundings here gave us 298
fathoms, with a bottom of volcanic pebbles. We tied up again to
the ice, and during the afternoon the shore-party filled the
little tank on top of the boiler-room grating with snow, and the
resulting water made the tea much more pleasant than the water
from the ship's tanks to which we had been accustomed.</p>
<p>About four o'clock we got under way and started towards Cape
Barne on the look-out for a suitable landing-place. About two
miles off the point, at 6 p.m., a sounding of seventy-nine
fathoms was obtained, and half a mile further in the depth was
forty-four fathoms. The arming of the lead was covered with
sponge spicules, suggesting that this place would be a fine
hunting-ground for the biologist. Steaming slowly north along the
coast we saw across the bay a long, low snow-slope, connected
with the bare rock of Cape Royds, which appeared to be a likely
place for winter quarters.</p>

<br>
<small>26. A SNOW CORNICE</small></p>
<p>About eight o'clock, accompanied by Adams and Wild in the
whale boat, and taking the hand lead with us, I left the ship and
went in towards the shore. After about ten minutes' pulling, with
frequent stops for soundings, we came up against fast ice. This
covered the whole of the small bay from the corner of Flagstaff
Point, as we afterwards named the seaward cliff at the southern
end of Cape Royds, to Cape Barne to the southward. Close up to
the Point the ice had broken out, leaving a little natural dock.
We ran the boat into this, and Adams and I scrambled ashore,
crossing a well-defined tide-crack and going up a smooth
snow-slope about fifteen yards wide, at the top of which was bare
rock. Hundreds of penguins were congregated on the bay ice, and
hundreds more on the top of the slope, and directly we reached
the bare land our nostrils were greeted with the overbearing
stench of the rookery where there were many hundreds of Adelie
penguins. These were moving to and fro, and they greeted us with
hoarse squawks of excitement. Above them were flying many of
their natural enemies, the rapacious Skua gulls. These birds had
young, for as we walked along, evidently nearing the nestlings,
they began to swoop down on us, almost touching our heads, and
the sharp whirr of their rapidly moving wings told us how
strongly they resented our intrusion.</p>
<p>A very brief examination of the vicinity of the ice-foot was
sufficient to show us that Cape Royds would make an excellent
place on which to land our stores. We therefore shoved off in the
boat again, and, skirting along the ice-foot to the south,
sounded the bay, and found that the water deepened from two
fathoms close in shore to about twenty fathoms four hundred yards
further south. After completing these soundings we pulled out
towards the ship, which had been coming in very slowly. We were
pulling along at a good rate when suddenly a heavy body shot out
of the water, struck the seaman who was pulling stroke, and
dropped with a thud into the bottom of the boat. The arrival was
an Adelie penguin. It was hard to say who was the most
astonished&mdash;the penguin, at the result of its leap on to
what it had doubtless thought was a rock, or we, who so suddenly
took on board this curious passenger. The sailors in the boat
looked upon this incident as an omen of good luck. There is a
tradition amongst seamen that the souls of old sailors, after
death, occupy the bodies of penguins, as well as of albatrosses;
this idea, however, does not prevent the mariners from making a
hearty meal off the breasts of the former when opportunity
offers. We arrived on board at 9 p.m., and by 10 p.m. on February
3 the <i>Nimrod</i> was moored to the bay ice, ready to land the
stores.</p>

<br>
<small>C. "THE DREADNOUGHT"</small></p>
<p>Immediately after securing the ship I went ashore, accompanied
by the Professor, England and Dunlop, to choose a place for
building the hut. We passed the penguins, which were marching
solemnly to and fro, and on reaching the level land, made for a
huge boulder of kenyte, the most conspicuous mark in the
locality. I thought that we might build the hut under the lee of
this boulder, sheltered from the south-east wind, but the
situation had its drawbacks, as it would have entailed a large
amount of levelling before the foundation of the hut could have
been laid. We crossed a narrow ridge of rock just beyond the
great boulder, and, turning a little to the right up a small
valley, found an ideal spot for our winter quarters. The floor of
this valley was practically level and covered with a couple of
feet of volcanic earth; at the sides the bed rock was exposed,
but a rough eye measurement was quite sufficient to show that
there would be not only ample room for the hut itself, but also
for all the stores, and for a stable for the ponies. A hill right
behind this little valley would serve as an excellent shelter to
the hut from what we knew was the prevailing strong wind, that
is, the south-easter. A glance at the illustrations will give the
reader a much better idea of this place than will a written
description, and he will see how admirably Nature had provided us
with a protection against her own destructive forces.</p>
<p>After deciding on this place as our home for the winter we
went round a ridge to the south, and on a level piece of ground
overlooking the bay we came across the camp where Captain Scott
and Dr. Wilson spent some days in January 1904 whilst they were
waiting for the arrival of the relief ship. The camp had been
placed in a splendid position, with an uninterrupted view of the
sea to the north and the great panorama of the western mountains.
We found all the camp gear and cooking utensils just as they had
been left, and, considering the exposed position of the camp, it
appeared as though this spot could not have been subjected to
very violent storms, otherwise the tent cloths, empty boxes, and
other things lying about would have been blown away. From the top
of the ridge we could see a small bay inside the wide one in
which the ship was lying, and a little more to the eastward was a
smaller bay, the end of which formed the sea limit to this part
of the coast. A number of seals lying on the bay ice gave promise
that there would be no lack of fresh meat.</p>
<p>With this ideal situation for a camp, and everything else
satisfactory, including a supply of water from a lake right in
front of our little valley, I decided that we could not do better
than start getting our gear ashore at once. There was only one
point that gave me any anxiety, and that was as to whether the
sea would freeze over between this place and Hut Point in ample
time for us to get across for the southern and western journeys
in the following spring. It was also obvious that nothing could
be done in the way of laying out depots for the next season's
work, as directly the ship left we would be cut off from any
communication with the lands to the south of us, by sea and by
land, for the heavily crevassed glaciers fringing the coast were
an effectual bar to a march with sledges. However, time was
pressing, and we were fortunate to get winter quarters as near as
this to our starting-point for the south.</p>

<br>
<h3>THE LANDING OF STORES AND EQUIPMENT</h3>
<p><b>WE</b> returned to the ship to start discharging our
equipment, and with this work commenced the most uncomfortable
fortnight, and the hardest work, full of checks and worries, that
I or any other member of the party had ever experienced. If it
had not been for the whole-hearted devotion of our party, and
their untiring energy, we would never have got through the long
toil of discharging. Day and night, if such terms of low
latitudes can be used in a place where there was no night, late
and early, they were always ready to turn to, in face of most
trying conditions, and always with a cheerful readiness. If a
fresh obstacle appeared there was no time lost in bemoaning the
circumstance, but they all set to work at once to remove the
obstruction. The first thing to be landed was the motor-car, and
after that came the ponies, for it was probable that any day
might see the breakup of the bay ice, and there being only two
fathoms of water along the shore, as we had ascertained by
sounding down the tide crack, the ship could not go very close
in. It would have been practically impossible to have landed the
ponies in boats, for they were only half-broken in, and all in a
highly strung, nervous condition. At 10.30 p.m. on February 3 we
swung the motor over on to the bay ice, and all hands pulled it
up the snow slope across the tide-crack and left it safe on the
solid ground. This done, we next landed one of the lifeboats,
which we intended to keep down there with us. Joyce ran the dogs
ashore and tied them up to rocks, all except Possum, who was
still engaged with her little puppies. Then followed the
foundation pieces of the hut, for it was desirable that we should
be safely housed before the ship went north. Meanwhile, the
carpenter was busily engaged in unbolting the framework of the
pony-stalls, and the animals became greatly excited, causing us a
lot of trouble. We worked till 3 a.m., landing pony fodder and
general stores, and then knocked off and had some cocoa and a
rest, intending to turn to at 6 a.m.</p>
<p>We had hardly started work again when a strong breeze sprung
up with drifting snow. The ship began to bump heavily against the
ice-foot and twice dragged her anchors out, so, as there seemed
no possibility of getting ahead with the landing of the stores
under these conditions, we steamed out and tied up at the main
ice-face, about six miles to the south, close to where we had
lain for the past few days. It blew fairly hard all day and right
through the evening, but the wind went down on the afternoon of
the 5th, and we returned to the bay that evening. The poor dogs
had been tied up all this time, without any shelter or food, so
directly we made fast, Joyce was off ashore with a steaming hot
feed for them. Scamp came running down to meet him, and Queenie
had got loose and played havoc amongst the penguins. They had
killed over a hundred, and the skuas were massed in great
numbers, taking full advantage of this disaster. We never saw
Queenie again. She must have fallen over a cliff into the
sea.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-pic027"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>27. LANDING STORES FROM THE BOAT AT THE FIRST LANDING
PLACE AFTER THE ICE-FOOT HAD BROKEN AWAY</small></p>
<p>We lost no time in getting the ponies ashore. This was by no
means an easy task, for some of the animals were very restive,
and it required care to avoid accident to themselves or to us.
Some time before we had thought of walking them down over a
gangplank on to the ice, but afterwards decided to build a rough
horse-box, get them into this, and then sling it over the side by
means of the main gaff. We covered the decks with ashes and
protected all sharp projections with bags and bales of fodder.
The first pony went in fairly quietly, and in another moment or
two had the honour of being the pioneer horse on the Antarctic
ice. One after another the ponies were led out of the stalls into
the horse-box and were slung over on to the ice. Presently it
came to Grisi's turn, and we looked for a lively time with this
pony, for he was the most spirited and in the best condition of
all. Our anticipations proved correct, and there were a few
lively minutes before he was secured in the horse-box, the door
of which was fastened with a rope. It was only by Mackay exerting
all his strength at the most critical moment that we got the pony
in. As the box was being hoisted up, his violent kicking
threatened to demolish the somewhat frail structure, and it was
with a devout feeling of thankfulness that I saw him safe on the
ice. They all seemed to feel themselves at home, for they
immediately commenced pawing at the snow as they are wont to do
in their own faraway Manchurian home, where, in the winter, they
scrape away the snow to get out the rough tussocky grass that
lies underneath. It was 3.30 a.m. on the morning of the 6th
before we got all the ponies off the ship, and they were at once
led up on to the land. The poor beasts were naturally stiff after
the constant buffeting they had experienced in their narrow
stalls on the rolling ship for over a month, and they walked very
stiffly ashore. They negotiated the tide-crack all right, the
fissure being narrow, and were soon picketed out on some bare
earth at the entrance to a valley which lay about fifty yards
from the site of our hut. We thought that this would be a good
place, but the selection was to cost us dearly in the future. The
tide-crack played an important part in connection with the
landing of the stores. In the polar regions, both north and
south, when the sea is frozen over, there always appears between
the fast ice, which is the ice attached to the land, and the sea
ice, a crack which is due to the sea ice moving up and down with
the rise and fall of the tide. When the bottom of the sea slopes
gradually from the land, sometimes two or three tide cracks
appear running parallel to each other. When no more tide-cracks
are to be seen landwards, the snow or ice-foot has always been
considered as being a permanent adjunct to the land, and in our
case this opinion was further strengthened by the fact that our
soundings in the tide-crack showed that the ice-foot on the
landward side of it must be aground. I have explained this fully,
for it was after taking into consideration these points that I,
for convenience sake, landed the bulk of the stores just below
the bare rocks on what I considered to be the permanent
snow-slope.</p>
<p>About 9 a.m. on the morning of February 6 we started work with
sledges, hauling provisions and pieces of the hut to the shore.
The previous night the foundation posts of the hut had been sunk
and frozen into the ground with a cement composed of volcanic
earth and water. The digging of the foundation holes, on which
job Dunlop, Adams, Joyce, Brocklehurst and Marshall were engaged,
proved hard work, for in some cases where the hole had to be dug
the bedrock was found a few inches below the coating of the
earth, and this had to be broken through or drilled with chisel
and hammer. Now that the ponies were ashore it was necessary to
have a party living ashore also, for the animals would require
looking after if the ship were forced to leave the ice-foot at
any time, and, of course, the building of the hut could go on
during the absence of the ship. The first shore party consisted
of Adams, Marston, Brocklehurst, Mackay and Murray, and two tents
were set up close to the hut, with the usual sledging requisites,
sleeping-bags, cookers, &amp;c. A canvas cover was rigged on some
oars to serve as a cooking-tent, and this, later on, was enlarged
into a more commodious house, built out of bales of fodder.</p>
<p>The first things landed this day were bales of fodder for the
ponies, and sufficient petroleum and provisions for the shore
party in the event of the ship having to put to sea suddenly
owing to bad weather. For facility in landing the stores, the
whole party was divided into two gangs. Some of the crew of the
ship hoisted the stores out of the hold and slid them down a wide
plank on to the ice, others of the ship's crew loaded the stores
on to the sledges, and these were hauled to land by the shore
party, each sledge having three men harnessed to it. The road to
the shore consisted of hard, rough ice, alternating with very
soft snow, and as the distance from where the ship was lying at
first to the tide-crack was nearly a quarter of a mile, it was
strenuous toil, especially when the tide-crack was reached and
the sledges had to be pulled up the slope. After the first few
sledge-loads had been hauled right up on to the land, I decided
to let the stores remain on the snow slope beyond the tide-crack,
where they could be taken away at leisure. The work was so heavy
that we tried to substitute mechanical haulage in place of man
haulage, and to achieve this end we anchored a block in the snow
slope just over the tide-crack, and having spliced together
practically all the running gear and all the spare line in the
ship, we rove one end of the rope through the block and brought
it back to the ship. The other end was brought round the barrel
of the steam winch, and after the first part had been made fast
to the loaded sledges, orders were given to heave away on the
winch, and the sledges were, in this manner, hauled ashore. This
device answered well enough in principle, but in actual practice
we found that the amount of time that would be occupied in doing
the work would be too great, especially because of the necessity
for hauling back the rope to the ship each time, as in our
present position we could not make an endless haulage. We
therefore reverted to our original plan, and all that morning did
the work by man haulage. During the lunch hour we shifted the
ship about a hundred yards nearer the shore alongside the
ice-face, from which a piece had broken out during the morning,
leaving a level edge where the ship could be moored easily.</p>
<p>Just as we were going to commence work at 2 p.m. a fresh
breeze sprung up from the south-east, and the ship began to bump
against the ice-foot, her movement throwing the water over the
ice. We were then lying in a rather awkward position in the apex
of an angle in the bay ice, and as the breeze threatened to
become stronger, I sent the shore-party on to the ice, and, with
some difficulty, we got clear of the ice-foot. The breeze
freshening we stood out to the fast ice in the strait about six
miles to the south and anchored there. It blew a fresh breeze
with drift from the south-east all that afternoon and night, and
did not ease up till the following afternoon. During this time.
Cape Royds, Mount Erebus, and Mount Bird were quite obscured, and
from where we were lying there appeared to be bad weather ashore,
but when we returned to the bay the following night at 10 p.m. we
heard that, except for a little falling snow, the weather had
been quite fine, and that the wind which had sprung up at two
o'clock had not continued for more than an hour. Thus,
unfortunately, two valuable working days were lost.</p>
<p>When I went ashore I found that the little party left behind
had not only managed to get up to the site of the hut all the
heavy timber that had been landed, but had also stacked on the
bare land the various cases of provisions which had been lying on
the snow slope by the tide-crack. We worked till 2 a.m. on the
morning of the 9th, and then knocked off till 9 a.m. Then we
commenced again, and put in one of the hardest day's work one
could imagine, pulling the sledges to the tide-crack and then
hauling them bodily over. Hour after hour all hands toiled on the
work, the crossing of the tide-crack becoming more difficult with
each succeeding sledge-load, for the ice in the bay was
loosening, and it was over floating, rocking pieces of floe with
gaps several feet wide between them that we hauled the sledges.
In the afternoon the ponies were brought into action, as they had
had some rest, and their arrival facilitated the discharge,
though it did not lighten the labours of the perspiring staff.
None of our party were in very good condition, having been cooped
up in the ship, and the heavy cases became doubly heavy to their
arms and shoulders by midnight.</p>
<p>Next day the work continued, the ice still holding in, but
threatening every minute to go out. If there had been sufficient
water for the ship to lie right alongside the shore we would have
been pleased to see the ice go out, but at the place where we
were landing the stores there was only twelve feet of water, and
the <i>Nimrod</i> at this time, drew fourteen. We tried to anchor
one of the smaller loose pieces of bay ice to the ice-foot, and
this answered whilst the tide was setting in. As a result of the
tidal movement, the influx of heavy pack in the bay where we were
lying caused some anxiety, and more than once we had to shift the
ship away from the landing place because of the heavy floes and
hummocky ice which pressed up against the bay ice. One large berg
sailed in from the north and grounded about a mile to the south
of Cape Royds, and later another about the same height, not less
than one hundred and fifty feet, did the same, and these two
bergs were frozen in when they grounded and remained in that
position through the winter. The hummocky pack that came in and
out with the tide was over fifteen feet in height, and, being of
much greater depth below water, had ample power and force to
damage the ship if a breeze sprang up.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-diag06"></a><img alt=""
src="1202361h-images/hs-diag06.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>D6. PLAN OF ICE EDGE</small></p>
<p>When we turned to after lunch, and before the first
sledge-load reached the main landing place, we found that it
would be impossible to continue working there any longer, for the
small floe which we had anchored to the ice had dragged out the
anchor and was being carried to sea by the ebbing tide. Some
three hundred and fifty yards further along the shore of the bay
was a much steeper ice-foot at the foot of the cliffs, and a snow
slope narrower than the one on which we had been landing the
provisions. This was the nearest available spot at which to
continue discharging. We hoped that when the ship had left we
could hoist the stores up over the cliff; they would then be
within a hundred yards of the hut, and, after being carried for a
short distance, they could be rolled down the steep snow slope at
the head of the valley where it was being built. All this time
the hut-party were working day and night, and the building was
rapidly assuming an appearance of solidity. The uprights were in,
and the brace ties were fastened together, so that if it came on
to blow there was no fear of the structure being destroyed.</p>
<p>The stores had now to be dragged a distance of nearly three
hundred yards from the ship to the landing place, but this work
was greatly facilitated by our being able to use four of the
ponies, working two of them for an hour, and then giving these a
spell whilst two others took their place. The snow was very deep,
and the ponies sank in well above the knees; it was heavy going
for the men who were leading them. A large amount of stores were
landed in this way, but a new and serious situation arose through
the breaking away of the main ice-foot.</p>
<p>On the previous day an ominous-looking crack had been observed
to be developing at the end of the ice-foot nearest to Flagstaff
Point, and it became apparent that if this crack continued to
widen, it would cut right across the centre of our stores, with
the result that, unless removed, they would be irretrievably lost
in the sea. Next day (the 10th) there was no further opening of
the crack, but at seven o'clock that night another crack formed
on the ice-foot inside of Derrick Point where we were now landing
stores. There was no immediate danger to be apprehended at this
place, for the bay ice would have to go out before the ice-foot
could fall into the sea. Prudence suggested that it would be
better to shift the stores already landed to a safer place before
discharging any more from the ship, so at 8 p.m. on the 10th we
commenced getting the remainder of the wood for the hut and the
bales of cork for the lining up on to the bare land. This took
till about midnight, when we knocked off for cocoa and a
sleep.</p>
<p>We turned to at six o'clock next morning, and I decided to get
the stores up the cliff face at Derrick Point before dealing with
those at Front Door Bay, the first landing place, for the former
ice-foot seemed in the greater peril of collapse than did the
latter. Adams, Joyce and Wild soon rigged up a boom and tackle
from the top of the cliff, making the heel of the boom fast by
placing great blocks of volcanic rocks on it. A party remained
below on the ice-foot to shift and hook on the cases, whilst
another party on top, fifty feet above, hauled away when the word
was given from below, and on reaching the top of the cliff, the
cases were hauled in by means of a guy rope. The men were hauling
on the thin rope of the tackle from eight o'clock in the morning
till one o'clock the following morning with barely a spell for a
bit to eat.</p>
<p>We now had to find another and safer place on which to land
the rest of the coal and stores. Further round the bay from where
the ship was lying was a smaller bight where a gentle slope led
on to bare rocks, and Back Door Bay, as we named this place,
became our new depot. The ponies were led down the hill, and from
Back Door Bay to the ship. This was a still longer journey than
from Derrick Point, but there was no help for it, and we started
landing the coal, after laying a tarpaulin on the rocks to keep
the coal from becoming mixed with the earth. By this time there
were several ugly looking cracks in the bay ice, and these kept
opening and closing having a play of seven or eight inches
between the floes. We improvised bridges out of the bottom and
sides of the motor-car case so that the ponies could cross the
cracks, and by eleven o'clock were well under way with the work.
Mackay had just taken ashore a load with a pony, Armytage was
about to hook on another pony to a loaded sledge at the ship, and
a third pony was standing tied to our stern anchor rope waiting
its turn for sledging, when suddenly, without the slightest
warning, the greater part of the bay ice opened out into floes,
and the whole mass that had opened started to drift slowly out to
sea. The ponies on the ice were now in a perilous position. The
sailors rushed to loosen the one tied to the stern rope, and got
it over the first crack, and Armytage also got the pony he was
looking after off the floe nearest the ship on to the next floe.
Just at that moment Mackay appeared round the corner from Back
Door Bay with a third pony attached to an empty sledge, on his
way back to the ship to load up. Orders were shouted to him not
to come any further, but he did not at first grasp the situation,
for he continued advancing over the ice, which was now breaking
away more rapidly. The party working on the top of Derrick Point,
by shouting and waving, made him realise what had occurred. He
accordingly left his sledge and pony and rushed over towards
where the other two ponies were adrift on the ice, and, by
jumping the widening cracks, he reached the moving floe on which
they were standing. This piece of ice gradually drew closer to a
larger piece, from which the animals would be able to gain a
place of safety. Mackay started to try and get the pony Chinaman
across the crack when it was only about six inches wide, but the
animal suddenly took fright, reared up on his hind legs, and
backing towards the edge of the floe, which had at that moment
opened to a width of a few feet, fell bodily into the ice-cold
water. It looked as if it was all over with poor Chinaman, but
Mackay hung on to the head rope, and Davis, Mawson, Michell and
one of the sailors who were on the ice close by, rushed to his
assistance. The pony managed to get his fore feet on to the edge
of the ice floe. After great difficulty a rope sling was passed
underneath him, and then by tremendous exertion he was lifted up
far enough to enable him to scramble on to the ice. There he
stood, wet and trembling in every limb. A few seconds later the
floe closed up against the other one. It was providential that it
had not done so during the time that the pony was in the water,
for in that case the animal would inevitably have been squeezed
to death between the two huge masses of ice. A bottle of brandy
was thrown on to the ice from the ship, and half its contents
were poured down Chinaman's throat. The ship was now turning
round with the object of going bow on to the floe, in order to
push it ashore, so that the ponies might cross on to the fast
ice, and presently, with the engine at full speed, the floe was
slowly but surely moved back against the fast ice. Directly the
floe was hard up against the unbroken ice, the ponies were rushed
across and taken straight ashore, and the men who were on the
different floes took advantage of the temporary closing of the
crack to get themselves and the stores into safety. I decided,
after this narrow escape, not to risk the ponies on the sea ice
again. The ship was now backed out, and the loose floes began to
drift away to the west.</p>

<br>
<small>28. THE LANDING-PLACE WHARF BROKEN UP</small></p>
<p>By 1 p.m. most of the ice had cleared out, and the ship came
in to the edge of the fast ice, which was now abreast of Back
Door Bay. Hardly were the ice-anchors made fast before new cracks
appeared, and within a quarter of an hour the ship was adrift
again. As it was impossible to discharge under these conditions,
the <i>Nimrod</i> stood off. We had now practically the whole of
the wintering party ashore, so when lunch was over, the main
party went on with the work at Derrick Point, refreshed by the
hot tea and meat, which they hastily swallowed.</p>
<p>I organised that afternoon a small party to shift the main
stores into safety. We had not been long at work before I saw
that it would need the utmost despatch and our most strenuous
endeavours to save the valuable cases; for the crack previously
observed opened more each hour. Perspiration poured down our
faces and bodies as we toiled in the hot sun. After two hours'
work we had shifted into a place of safety all our cases of
scientific instruments, and a large quantity of fodder, and
hardly were they secured when, with a sharp crack, the very place
where they had been lying fell with a crash into the sea. Had we
lost these cases the result would have been very serious, for a
great part of our scientific work could not have been carried
out, and if the fodder had been lost, it would have meant the
loss of the ponies also. The breaking of this part of the ice
made us redouble our efforts to save the rest of the stores, for
we could not tell when the next piece of ice might break off,
though no crack was yet visible. The breaking up of the bay ice
that morning turned out to be after all for the best, for I would
not otherwise have gone on so early with this work. I ran up the
hill to the top of Flagstaff Point, as we called the cliff at the
southern extremity of Cape Royds, to call the ship in, in order
to obtain additional help from the crew; she had been dodging
about outside of the point since one o'clock, but she was beyond
hailing distance, and it was not till about seven o'clock that I
saw her coming close in again. I at once hailed England and told
him to send every available man ashore immediately. In a few
minutes a boat came off with half a dozen men, and I sent a
message back by the officer in charge for more members of the
ship's crew to be landed at once, and only enough men left on
board to steer the ship and work the engines. I had previously
knocked off the party working on the hut, and with the extra
assistance we "smacked things about" in a lively fashion. The ice
kept breaking off in chunks, but we had the satisfaction of
seeing every single package safe on the rocks by midnight.</p>
<p>Our party then proceeded to sledge the heavier cases and the
tins of oil at the foot of Derrick Point round the narrow
causeway of ice between the perpendicular rocks and the sea to
the depot at Back Door Bay. I was astonished and delighted on
arriving at the derrick to find the immense amount of stores that
had been placed in safety by the efforts of the Derrick Point
party, and by 1 a.m. on February 13 all the stores landed were in
safety. About a ton of flour in cases remained to be hauled up,
but as we already had enough ashore to last us for a year, and
knowing that at Hut Point there were large quantities of biscuit
left by the last expedition, which would be available if needed,
we just rolled the cases on the ice-foot into a hollow at the
foot of the cliff, where they were in comparative safety, as the
ice there would not be likely to break away immediately. We
retrieved these after the ship left.</p>
<p>As I stated in the chapter on the equipment of the expedition,
I tried to get the bulk of the stores into cases of uniform size
and weight, averaging fifty to sixty pounds gross, and thus allow
of more easy handling than would have been the case if the stores
were packed in the usual way. The goods packed in Venesta cases
could withstand the roughest treatment without breakage or damage
to the contents. These Venesta cases are made of three thin
layers of wood, fastened together by a patent process; the
material is much tougher than ordinary wood, weighs much less
than a case of the same size made of the usual deal, and being
thinner, takes up much less room, a consideration of great moment
to a Polar expedition. The wood could not be broken by the direct
blow of a heavy hammer, and the empty cases could be used for the
making of the hundred and one odds and ends that have to be
contrived to meet requirements in such an expedition as this.</p>
<p>At 1 a.m. on the morning of February 13 I signalled the ship
to come in to take off the crew, and a boat was sent ashore.
There was a slight breeze blowing, and it took them some time to
pull off to the <i>Nimrod</i> which lay a long way out. We on
shore turned in, and we were so tired that it was noon before we
woke up. A glance out to sea showed that we had lost nothing by
our sleep, for there was a heavy swell running into the bay and
it would have been quite impossible to have landed any stores at
all. In the afternoon the ship came in fairly close, but I
signalled England that it was useless to send the boat. This
northerly swell, which we could hear thundering on the ice-foot,
would have been welcome a fortnight before, for it would have
broken up a large amount of fast ice to the south, and I could
not help imagining that probably at this date there was open
water up to Hut Point. Now, however, it was the worst thing
possible for us, as the precious time was slipping by, and the
still more valuable coal was being used up by the continual
working of the ship's engines. Next day the swell still
continued, so at 4 p.m. I signalled England to proceed to Glacier
Tongue and land a depot there. Glacier Tongue is a remarkable
formation of ice which stretches out into the sea from the
south-west slopes of Mount Erebus. About five miles in length,
running east and west, tapering almost to a point at its seaward
end, and having a width of about a mile where it descends from
the land, cracked and crevassed all over and floating in deep
water, it is a phenomenon which still remains a mystery. It lies
about eight miles to the northward of Hut Point, and about
thirteen to the south-ward of Cape Royds, and I thought this
would be a good place at which to land a quantity of sledging
stores, as by doing so we would be saved haulage at least
thirteen miles, the distance between the spot on the southern
route and Cape Royds. The ship arrived there in the early
evening, and landed the depot on the north side of the Tongue.
The Professor took bearings so that there might be no difficulty
in finding the depot when the sledging season commenced. The
sounding at this spot gave a depth of 157 fathoms. From the
seaward end of the glacier it was observed that the ice had
broken away only a couple of miles further south, so the
northerly swell had not been as far reaching in its effect as I
had imagined. The ship moored at the Tongue for the night.</p>

<br>
<small>29. DERRICK POINT, SHOWING THE METHOD OF HAULING STORES UP
THE CLIFF</small></p>
<p>During this day we, ashore at Cape Royds, were variously
employed; one party continued the building of the hut, whilst the
rest of us made a more elaborate temporary dwelling and cook
house than we had had up to that time. The walls were constructed
of bales of fodder, which lent themselves admirably for this
purpose, the cook-tent tarpaulin was stretched over these for a
roof and was supported on planks, and the outer walls were stayed
with uprights from the pony-stalls. As the roof was rather low
and people could not stand upright, a trench was dug at one end,
where the cook could move about without bending his back the
whole time. In this corner were concocted the most delicious
dishes that ever a hungry man could wish for. Wild acted as cook
till Roberts came ashore permanently, and it was a sight to see
us in the dim light that penetrated through the door of the
fodder hut as we sat in a row on cases, each armed with a spoon
manufactured out of tin and wood by the ever-inventive Day,
awaiting with eagerness our bowl of steaming hoosh or rich
dark-coloured penguin breast, followed by biscuit, butter and
jam; tea and smokes ended up the meal, and, as we lazily
stretched ourselves out for the smoke, regardless of a
temperature of 16 or 18 degrees of frost, we felt that things
were not so bad.</p>
<p>The same day that we built the fodder hut we placed inside it
some cases of bottled fruit, hoping to save them from being
cracked by the severe frost outside. The bulk of the cases
containing liquid we kept on board the ship till the last moment
so that they could be put into the main hut when the fire was
lighted. We turned in about midnight, and got up at seven next
morning. The ship had just come straight in, and I went off on
board. Marshall also came off to attend to Mackintosh, whose
wound was rapidly healing. He was now up and about. He was very
anxious to stay with us, but Marshall did not think it advisable
for him to risk it. During the whole of this day and the next,
the 15th, the swell was too great to admit of any stores being
landed, but early on the morning of the 16th we found it possible
to get ashore at a small ice-foot to the north of Flagstaff
Point, and here, in spite of the swell, we managed to land six
boatloads of fruit, some oil, and twenty-four bags of coal. The
crew of the boat, whilst the stores were being taken out, had to
keep to their oars, and whenever the swell rolled on the shelving
beach, they had to back with all their might to keep the bow of
the boat from running under the overhanging ice-foot and being
crushed under the ice by the lifting wave. Davis, the chief
officer of the <i>Nimrod</i>, worked like a Titan. A tall,
red-headed Irishman, typical of his country, he was always
working and always cheerful, having no time limit for his work.
He and Harbord, the second officer, a quiet, self-reliant man,
were great acquisitions to the expedition. These two officers
were ably supported by the efforts of the crew. They had nothing
but hard work and discomfort from the beginning of the voyage,
and yet they were always cheerful, and worked splendidly. Dunlop,
the chief engineer, not only kept his department going smoothly
on board but was the principal constructor of the hut. A great
deal of the credit for the work being so cheerfully performed was
due to the example of Cheetham, who was an old hand in the
Antarctic, having been boatswain of the Morning on both the
voyages she made for the relief of the <i>Discovery</i>. He was
third mate and boatswain on this expedition.</p>
<p>When I had gone on board the previous day I found that England
was still poorly and that he was feeling the strain of the
situation. He was naturally very anxious to get the ship away and
concerned about the shrinkage of the coal supply. I also would
have been glad to have seen the <i>Nimrod</i> on her way north,
but it was impossible to let her leave until the wintering party
had received their coal from her. In view of the voyage home, the
ship's main topmast was struck to lessen her rolling in bad
weather. It was impossible to ballast the ship with rock, as the
time needed for this operation would involve the consumption of
much valuable coal, and I was sure that the heavy ironbark and
oak hull? and the weight of the engine and boiler filled with
water would be sufficient to ensure the ship's safety.</p>
<p>We found it impossible to continue working at Cliff Point
later on in the day, so the ship stood off whilst those on shore
went on with the building of the hut. Some of the shore-party had
come off in the last boat to finish writing their final letters
home, and during the night we lay to waiting for the swell to
decrease. The weather was quite fine, and if it had not been for
the swell we could have got through a great deal of work.
February is by no means a fine month in the latitude we were in,
and up till now we had been extremely fortunate, as we had not
experienced a real blizzard.</p>
<p>The following morning, Monday, February 17, the sea was
breaking heavily on the ice-foot at the bottom of Cliff Point.
The stores that had been landed the previous day had been hoisted
up the overhanging cliff and now formed the fourth of our
scattered depots of coal and stores. The swell did not seem so
heavy in Front Door Bay, so we commenced landing the stores in
the whaleboat at the place where the ice-foot had broken away, a
party on shore hauling the bags of coal and the cases up the
ice-face, which was about fourteen feet high. The penguins were
still round us in large numbers. We had not had any time to make
observations on them, being so busily employed discharging the
ship, but just at this particular time our attention was called
to a couple of these birds which suddenly made a spring from the
water and landed on their feet on the ice-edge, having cleared a
vertical height of twelve feet. It seemed a marvellous jump for
these small creatures to have made, and shows the rapidity with
which they must move through the water to gain the impetus that
enables them to clear a distance in vertical height four times
greater than their own, and also how unerring must be their
judgment in estimation of the distance and height when performing
this feat. The work of landing stores at this spot was greatly
hampered by the fact that the bay was more or less filled with
broken floes, through which the boat had to be forced. It was
impossible to use the oars in the usual way, so, on arriving at
the broken ice, they were employed as poles. The bow of the boat
was entered into a likely looking channel, and then the crew,
standing up, pushed the boat forward by means of the oars, the
ice generally giving way on each side, but sometimes closing up
and nipping the boat, which, if it had been less strongly built,
would assuredly have been crushed. The Professor, Mawson, Cotton,
Michell and a couple of seamen formed the boat's crew, and with
Davis or Harbord in the stern, they dodged the ice very well,
considering the fact that the swell was rather heavy at the
outside edge of the floes. When alongside the ice-foot one of the
crew hung on to a rope in the bow, and another did the same in
the stern, hauling in the slack as the boat rose on top of the
swell, and easing out as the water swirled downwards from the
ice-foot. There was a sharp-pointed rock, which, when the swell
receded, was almost above water, and the greatest difficulty was
experienced in preventing the boat from crashing down on the top
of this. The rest of the staff in the boat and on shore hauled up
the cases and bags of coal at every available opportunity. The
coal was weighed at the top of the ice-foot, and the bags emptied
on to a heap which formed the main supply for the winter months.
We had now three depots of coal in different places round the
winter quarters. In the afternoon the floating ice at this place
became impassable, but fortunately it had worked its way out of
Back Door Bay, where, in spite of the heavy swell running against
the ice-foot, we were able to continue adding to the heap of coal
until nearly eight tons had been landed. It was a dull and weary
job except when unpleasantly enlivened by the imminent danger of
the boat being caught between heavy pieces of floating ice and
the solid ice-foot. These masses of ice rose and fell on the
swell, the water swirling round them as they became submerged,
and pouring off their top and sides as they rose to the surface.
It required all Harbord's watchfulness and speediness of action
to prevent damage to the boat. It is almost needless to observe
that all hands were as grimy as coal-heavers, especially the
boat's crew, who were working in the half-frozen slushy coaldust
and sea spray. The Professor, Mawson, Cotton, and Michell still
formed part of the crew. They had, by midnight, been over twelve
hours in the boat, excepting for about ten minutes' spell for
lunch, and after discharging each time had a long pull back to
the ship. When each boatload was landed, the coal and stores had
to be hauled up on a sledge over a very steep gradient to a place
of safety, and after this was accomplished, there was a long wait
for the next consignment.</p>
<p>Work was continued all night, though every one was nearly
dropping with fatigue; but I decided that the boat returning to
the ship at 5 a.m. (the 18th) should take a message to England
that the men were to knock off for breakfast and turn to at 7
a.m. Meanwhile Roberts had brewed some hot coffee in the hut,
where we now had the stove going, and, after a drink of this, our
weary people threw themselves down on the sleeping-bags in order
to snatch a short rest before again taking up the weary work. At
7 a.m. I went to the top of Flagstaff Point, but instead of
seeing the ship close in, I spied her hull down on the horizon,
and could see no sign of her approaching the winter quarters to
resume discharging. After watching her for about half an hour, I
returned to the hut, woke up those of the staff who from utter
weariness had dropped asleep, and told them to turn into their
bags and have a proper rest. I could not imagine why the ship was
not at hand, but at a quarter to eleven Harbord came ashore and
said that England wanted to see me on board; so, leaving the
others to sleep, I went off to the <i>Nimrod</i>. On asking
England why the ship was not in at seven to continue discharging,
he told me that all hands were so dead-tired that he thought it
best to let them have a sleep. The men were certainly worn out.
Davis' head had dropped on the wardroom table, and he had gone
sound asleep with his spoon in his mouth, to which he had just
conveyed some of his breakfast. Cotton had fallen asleep on the
platform of the engine-room steps, whilst Mawson, whose lair was
a little store-room in the engine-room, was asleep on the floor.
His long legs, protruding through the doorway, had found a
resting place on the crosshead of the engine, and his dreams were
mingled with a curious rhythmical motion which was fully
accounted for when he woke up, for the ship having got under way,
the up-and-down motion of the piston had moved his limbs with
every stroke. The sailors also were fast asleep; so, in the face
of this evidence of absolute exhaustion, I decided not to start
work again till after one o'clock, and told England definitely
that when the ship had been reduced in coal to ninety-two tons as
a minimum I would send her north. According to our experiences on
the last expedition, the latest date to which it would be sale to
keep the <i>Nimrod</i> would be the end of February, for the
young ice forming about that time on the sound would seriously
hamper her getting clear of the Ross Sea. Later observations of
the ice conditions of McMurdo Sound at our winter quarters showed
us that a powerfully engined ship could have gone north later in
the year, perhaps even in the winter, for we had open water close
to us all the time.</p>
<p>About 2 p.m. the <i>Nimrod</i> came close in to Flagstaff
Point to start discharging again. I decided that it was time to
land the more delicate instruments, such as watches,
chronometers, and all personal gear. The members of the staff who
were on board hauled their things out of Oyster Alley, and, laden
with its valuable freight, we took the whale boat into Front Door
Bay. Those who had been ashore now went on board to collect their
goods and finish their correspondence. This party consisted of
Day, Wild, Adams and Marshall. Mackintosh and the carpenter were
ashore, the latter being still busily engaged on the construction
of the hut, which was rapidly approaching completion. During the
afternoon we continued boating coal to Front Door Bay, which was
again free of ice, and devoted our attention almost entirely to
this work.</p>

<br>
<h3>A BLIZZARD: THE DEPARTURE OF THE <i>NIMROD</i></h3>
<p><b>ABOUT</b> five o'clock on the afternoon of February 18,
snow began to fall, with a light wind from the north, and as at
times the boat could hardly be seen from the ship, instructions
were given to the boat's crew that whenever the <i>Nimrod</i> was
not clearly visible they were to wait alongside the shore until
the snow squall had passed and she appeared in sight again. At
six o'clock, just as the boat had come alongside for another
load, the wind suddenly shifted to the south-east and freshened
immediately. The whaler was hoisted at once, and the
<i>Nimrod</i> stood off from the shore, passing between some
heavy ice-floes, against one of which her propeller struck, but
fortunately without sustaining any damage. Within half an hour it
was blowing a furious blizzard, and every sign of land, both east
and west, was obscured in the scudding drift. I was aboard the
vessel at the time. We were then making for the fast-ice to the
south, but the <i>Nimrod</i> was gaining but little headway
against the terrific wind and short, rising sea; so to save coal
I decided to keep the engines just going slow and maintain our
position in the sound as far as we could judge, though it was
inevitable that we should drift northward to a certain extent.
All night the gale raged with great fury. The speed of the gusts
at times must have approached a force of a hundred miles an hour.
The tops of the seas were cut off by the wind, and flung over the
decks, mast, and rigging of the ship, congealing at once into
hard ice, and the sides of the vessel were thick with the frozen
sea water. "The masts were grey with the frozen spray, and the
bows were a coat of mail." Very soon the cases and sledges lying
on deck were hard and fast in a sheet of solid ice, and the
temperature had dropped below zero. Harbord, who was the officer
on watch, on whistling to call the crew aft, found that the metal
whistle stuck to his lips, a painful intimation of the low
temperature. I spent most of the night on the bridge, and hoped
that the violence of the gale would be of but short duration.
This hope was not realised, for next morning, February 19, at 8
a.m., it was blowing harder than ever. During the early hours of
the day the temperature was minus 16&deg; Fahr., and consistently
kept below minus 12&deg; Fahr. The motion of the ship was sharp and
jerky, yet, considering the nature of the sea and the trim of the
vessel, she was remarkably steady. To a certain extent this was
due to the fact that the main topmast had been lowered. We had
constantly to have two men at the wheel, for the rudder, being so
far out of the water, received the blows of the sea as they
struck the quarter and stern; and the steersman having once been
flung right over the steering-chains against the side of the
ship, it was necessary to have two always holding on to the
kicking wheel. At times there would be a slight lull, the seas
striking less frequently against the rudder, and the result would
be that the rudder well soon got filled with ice, and it was
found impossible to move the wheel at all. To overcome this
dangerous state of things the steersmen had to keep moving the
wheel alternately to port and starboard, after the ice had been
broken away from the well. In spite of this precaution, the
rudder well occasionally became choked, and one of the crew,
armed with a long iron bar, had to stand by continually to break
the frozen sea water off the rudder. In the blinding drift it was
impossible to see more than a few yards from the ship, and once a
large iceberg suddenly loomed out of the drift close to the
weather bow of the <i>Nimrod</i>; fortunately the rudder had just
been cleared, and the ship answered her helm, thus avoiding a
collision.</p>
<p>All day on the 20th, through the night, and throughout the day
and night of the 21st, the gale raged. Occasionally the drift
ceased, and we saw dimly bare rocks, sometimes to the east and
sometimes to the west, but the upper parts of them being
enveloped in snow clouds, it was impossible to ascertain exactly
what our position was. At these times we were forced to wear
ship; that is, to turn the ship round, bringing the wind first
astern and then on to the other side, so that we could head in
the opposite direction. It was impossible in face of the storm to
tack, <i>i.e.</i>, to turn the ship's head into the wind, and
round, so as to bring the wind on the other side. About midnight
on the 21st, whilst carrying out this evolution of wearing ship,
during which the <i>Nimrod</i> always rolled heavily in the
trough of the waves, she shipped a heavy sea, and, all the
release-water ports and scupper holes being blocked with ice, the
water had no means of exit, and began to freeze on deck, where,
already, there was a layer of ice over a foot in thickness. Any
more weight like this would have made the ship unmanageable. The
ropes, already covered with ice, would have been frozen into a
solid mass, so we were forced to take the drastic step of
breaking holes in the bulwarks to allow the water to escape. This
had been done already in the forward end of the ship by the gales
we experienced on our passage down to the ice, but as the greater
part of the weight in the holds was aft, the water collected
towards the middle and stern, and the job of breaking through the
bulwarks was a tougher one than we had imagined; it was only by
dint of great exertions that Davis and Harbord accomplished it.
It was a sight to see Harbord, held by his legs, hanging over the
starboard side of the <i>Nimrod</i>, and wielding a heavy axe,
whilst Davis, whose length of limb enabled him to lean over
without being held, did the same on the other side. The
temperature at this time was several degrees below zero.
Occasionally on this night, as we approached the eastern shore,
the coast of Ross Island, we noticed the sea covered with a thick
yellowish-brown scum. This was due to the immense masses of snow
blown off the mountain sides out to sea, and this scum, to a
certain extent, prevented the tops of the waves from breaking.
Had it not been for this unexpected protection we would certainly
have lost our starboard boat, which had been unshipped in a sea
and was hanging in a precarious position for the time being. It
was hard to realise that so high and so dangerous a sea could
possibly have risen in the comparatively narrow waters of McMurdo
Sound. The wind was as strong as that we experienced in the gales
that assailed us after we first left New Zealand, but the waves
were not so huge as those which had the whole run of the Southern
Ocean in which to gather strength before they met us. At 2 a.m.
the weather suddenly cleared, and though the wind still blew
strongly and gustily, it was apparent that the force of the gale
had been expended. We could now see our position clearly. The
wind and current, in spite of our efforts to keep our position,
had driven us over thirty miles to the north, and at this time we
were abeam of Cape Bird. The sea was rapidly decreasing in
height, enabling us to steam for Cape Royds.</p>

src="1202361h-images/hs-colpicD.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>D. THE <i>NIMROD</i> RETURNS</small></p>
<p>We arrived there in the early morning, and I went ashore at
Back Door Bay, after pushing the whale boat through pancake ice
and slush, the result of the gale. Hurrying over to the hut I was
glad to see that it was intact, and then I received full details
of the occurrences of the last three days on shore. The report
was not very reassuring as regards the warmth of the hut, for the
inmates stated that, in spite of the stove being alight the whole
time, no warmth was given off. Of course the building was really
not at all complete. It had not been lined, and there were only
makeshift protections for the windows, but what seemed a grave
matter was the behaviour of the stove, for on the efficiency of
this depended not only our comfort but our very existence. The
shore-party had experienced a very heavy gale indeed. The hut had
trembled and shaken the whole time, and if the situation had not
been so admirable I doubt whether there would have been a hut at
all after the gale. A minor accident had occurred, for our fodder
hut had failed to withstand the gale, and one of the walls had
collapsed, killing one of Possum's pups. The roof had been
demolished at the same time.</p>
<p>On going down to our main landing place, the full effect of
the blizzard became apparent. There was hardly a sign to be seen
of the greater part of our stores. At first it appeared that the
drifting snow had covered the cases and bales and the coal, but a
closer inspection showed that the real disappearance of our
stores from view was due to the sea. Such was the force of the
wind blowing straight on to the shore from the south that the
spray had been flung in sheets over everything and had been
carried by the wind for nearly a quarter of a mile inland, and
consequently in places, our precious stores lay buried to a depth
of five or six feet in a mass of frozen sea water. The angles
taken up by the huddled masses of cases and bales had made the
surface of this mass of ice assume a most peculiar shape, as may
be seen from the illustrations. We feared that it would take
weeks of work to get the stores clear of the ice. It was probable
also that the salt water would have damaged the fodder, and
worked its way into cases that were not tin-lined or made of
Venesta wood, and that some of the things would never be seen
again. No one would have recognised the landing place as the spot
on which we had been working during the past fortnight, so great
was the change wrought by the furious storm. Our heap of coal had
a sheet of frozen salt water over it, but this was a blessing in
disguise, for it saved the smaller pieces of coal from being
blown away.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-pic030"></a><img alt=""
src="1202361h-images/hs-pic030.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>30. DIGGING OUT STORES AFTER THE CASES HAD BEEN BURIED IN
ICE DURING A BLIZZARD</small></p>
<p>There was no time then to do anything about releasing the
stores from the ice; the main thing was to get the remainder of
the coal ashore and send the ship north. We immediately started
landing coal at the extreme edge of Front Door Bay. The rate of
work was necessarily very slow, for the whole place was both
rough and slippery from the newly formed ice that covered
everything. In spite of the swell we worked all the morning, and
in the early afternoon, as the bay became full of ice,
instructions were sent to the ship to proceed to Glacier Tongue,
deposit five tons of coal there, and then report at Flagstaff
Point. The sea went down greatly about half an hour after the
ship left, and we were much pleased, about 6 p.m., to see the
<i>Nimrod</i> returning, for it was greatly to our advantage to
land the coal at winter quarters instead of having to sledge it
thirteen miles from Glacier Tongue.</p>
<p>On the <i>Nimrod</i>' s return, England reported that loose
floe-ice surrounded Glacier Tongue, so that it was impossible to
make a depot there. We now proceeded to continue discharging, and
shortly before 10 p.m. on February 22, the final boatload of coal
arrived. We calculated that we had in all only about eighteen
tons, so that the strictest economy would be required to make
this amount spin out until the sledging commenced in the
following spring. I should certainly have liked more coal, but
the delays that had occurred in finding winter quarters, and the
difficulties encountered in landing the stores had caused the
<i>Nimrod</i> to be kept longer than I had intended already. We
gave our final letters and messages to the crew of the last boat,
and said good-bye. Cotton, who had come south just for the trip,
was among them, and never had we a more willing worker. At 10
p.m. the <i>Nimrod</i>'s bows were pointed to the north, and she
was moving rapidly away from the winter quarters with a fair
wind. Within a month I hoped she would be safe in New Zealand,
and her crew enjoying a well-earned rest. We were all devoutly
thankful that the landing of the stores had been finished at
last, and that the state of the sea would no longer be a factor
in our work, but it was with something of a pang that we severed
our last connection with the world of men. We could hope for no
word of news from civilisation until the <i>Nimrod</i> came south
again in the following summer, and before that we had a good deal
of difficult work to do, and some risks to face.</p>
<p>There was scant time for reflection, even if we had been moved
that way. We turned in for a good night's rest as soon as
possible after the departure of the ship, and the following
morning we started digging the stores out of the ice, and
transporting everything to the vicinity of the hut. It was
necessary that the stores should be close by the building, partly
in order that there might be no difficulty in getting what goods
we wanted during the winter, and partly because we would require
all the protection that we could get from the cold, and the cases
would serve to keep off the wind when piled around out little
dwelling. We hoped, as soon as the stores had all been placed in
position, to make a start with the scientific observations that
were to be an important part of the work of the expedition.</p>

<small>31. THE <i>NIMROD</i> LYING OFF THE PENGUIN
ROOKERY</small></p>
<p>The next four or five days were spent in using pick and shovel
and iron crowbars on the envelope of ice that covered our cases,
corners of which only peeped out from the mass. The whole had the
appearance of a piece of the sweet known as almond rock, and
there was as much difficulty in getting the cases clear of the
ice as would be experienced if one tried to separate almonds from
that sticky conglomerate without injury. Occasionally the
breaking out of a case would disclose another which could be
easily extracted, but more often each case required the pick or
crowbars. A couple of earnest miners might be seen delving and
hewing the ice off a case, of which only the corner could be
seen, and after ten minutes' hard work it would be hauled up, and
the stencilled mark of its contents exposed to view. Brocklehurst
took great interest in the recovery of the chocolate, and during
this work took charge of one particular case which had been
covered by the ice. He carried it himself up to the hut so as to
be sure of its safety, and he was greeted with joy by the
Professor, who recognised in the load some of his scientific
instruments which were playing the part of the cuckoo in an old
chocolate box. Needless to say Brocklehurst's joy was not as
heartfelt as the Professor's.</p>
<p>After about four days' hard work at the Front Door Bay landing
place, the bulk of the stores was recovered, and I think we may
say that there was not much lost permanently, though, as time
went on, and one or two cases that were required did not turn up,
we used to wonder whether they had been left on board the ship,
or were buried under the ice. We do know for certain that our
only case of beer lies to this day under the ice, and it was not
until a few days before our final departure that one of the
scientists of the expedition dug out some volumes of the
Challenger reports, which had been intended to provide us with
useful reading matter during the winter nights. A question often
debated during the long, dark days was which of these stray
sheep, the Challenger reports or the case of beer, any particular
individual would dig for if the time and opportunity were
available. In moving up the recovered stores, as soon as a load
arrived within fifteen yards of the hut, where, at this time of
the year, the snow ended, and the bare earth lay uncovered, the
sledges were unpacked, and one party carried the stuff up to the
south side of the hut, whilst the sledges returned to the landing
place for more We were now utilising the ponies every day, and
they proved of great assistance in moving things to and fro. The
stores on the top of the hill at Derrick Point were fortunately
quite clear of snow, so we did not trouble to transport them,
contenting ourselves with getting down things that were of
immediate importance. Day by day we continued collecting our
scattered goods, and within ten days after the departure of the
ship we had practically everything handy to the hut, excepting
the coal. The labour had been both heavy and fertile in minor
accidents. Most of us at one time or another had wounds and
bruises to be attended to by Marshall, who was kept busy part of
every day dressing the injuries. Adams was severely cut in
handling some iron-bound cases, and I managed to jamb my fingers
in the motor-car. The annoying feature about these simple wounds
was the length of time it took for them to heal in our special
circumstances. The irritation seemed to be more pronounced if any
of the earth got into the wound, so we always took care after our
first experiences to go at once to Marshall for treatment, when
the skin was broken. The day after the ship left we laid in a
supply of fresh meat for the winter, killing about a hundred
penguins and burying them in a snowdrift close to the hut. By
February 28 we were practically in a position to feel contented
with ourselves, and to look further afield and explore the
neighbourhood of our winter quarters.</p>

<br>
<h3>AROUND THE WINTER QUARTERS: COMPLETION OF THE HUT</h3>
<p><b>FROM</b> the door of our hut, which faced the north-west,
we commanded a splendid view of the sound and the western
mountains. Right in front of us, at our door, lay a small lake,
which came to be known as Pony Lake; to the left of that was
another sheet of ice that became snow-covered in the autumn, and
it was here in the dark months that we exercised the ponies, and
also ourselves. Six times up and down the "Green Park", as it was
generally called, made a mile, and it was here, before darkness
came on, that we played hockey and football. To the left of Green
Park was a gentle slope leading down between two cliffs to the
sea, and ending in a little bay known as Dead Horse Bay. On
either side of this valley lay the penguin rookery, the slopes
being covered with guano, and during the fairly high temperatures
that held sway up to April, the smell from these deserted
quarters of the penguins was extremely unpleasant. On coming out
of the hut one had only to go round the corner of the building in
order to catch a glimpse of Mount Erebus, which lay directly
behind us. Its summit was about fifteen miles from our winter
quarters, but its slopes and foothills commenced within
three-quarters of a mile of the hut. Our view was cut off in all
directions from the east to the south-west by the ridge at the
head of the valley where the hut stood. On ascending this ridge,
one looked over the bay to the south-east, where lay Cape Barne.
To the right was Flagstaff Point, and to the left lay, at the
head of the Bay, the slopes of Erebus. There were many localities
which became favourite places for walks, and these are shown on
the accompanying map. Sandy Beach, about a mile away to the
north-west of the hut, was generally the goal of any one taking
exercise, when the uncertainty of the weather warned us against
venturing further afield, and while the dwindling light still
permitted us to go so far. It was here that we sometimes
exercised the ponies, and they much enjoyed rolling in the soft
sand. The beach was formed of black volcanic sand, blown from the
surrounding hills, and later on the pressed-up ice, which had
been driven ashore by the southward movement of the pack, also
became covered with the windborne dust and sand. The coastline
from Flagstaff Point right round to Horse Shoe Bay, on the north
side of Cape Royds, was jagged and broken up. At some points
ice-cliffs, in others bare rocks, jutted out into the sea, and
here and there small beaches composed of volcanic sand were
interposed. Our local scenery, though not on a grand scale,
loomed large in the light of the moon as the winter nights
lengthened. Fantastic shadows made the heights appear greater and
the valleys deeper, casting a spell of unreality around the
place, which never seemed to touch it by day. The greatest height
of any of the numerous sharp-pointed spurs of volcanic rock was
not more than three hundred feet, but we were infinitely better
off as regards the interest and the scenery of our winter
quarters than the expedition which wintered in McMurdo Sound
between 1901 and 1904. Our walks amongst the hills and across the
frozen lakes were a great source of health and enjoyment, and as
a field of work for geologists and biologists, Cape Royds far
surpassed Hut Point. The largest lake, which lay about half a
mile to the north-east, was named Blue Lake, from the intensely
vivid blue of the ice. This lake was peculiarly interesting to
Mawson, who made the study of ice part of his work. Beyond Blue
Lake, to the northward, lay Clear Lake, the deepest inland body
of water in our vicinity. To the left as one looked north, close
to the coast, was a circular basin which we called Coast Lake,
where, when we first arrived, hundreds of skua gulls were bathing
and flying about. Following the coast from this point back
towards winter quarters was another body of water called Green
Lake. In all these various lakes something of interest to science
was discovered, and though they were quite small, they were very
important to our work and in our eyes, and were a source of
continuous interest to us during our stay in the vicinity. Beyond
Blue Lake, to the east, rose the lower slopes of Mount Erebus,
covered with ice and snow. After passing one or two ridges of
volcanic rocks, there stretched a long snow plain, across which
sledges could travel without having their runners torn by gravel.
The slope down to Blue Lake was picked out for skiing and it was
here, in the early days, when work was over, that some of our
party used to slide from the top of the slope for about two
hundred feet, arriving at the bottom in a few seconds, and
shooting out across the frozen surface of the Lake, until brought
up by the rising slope on the other side. To the north of Clear
Lake the usual hills of volcanic rock separated by valleys filled
more or less with snow-drifts, stretched for a distance of about
a mile. Beyond this lay the coast, to the right of which, looking
north, was Horse Shoe Bay, about four miles from our winter
quarters; further to the right of the northern end of Cape Royds
the slopes of Erebus were reached again. From the northern coast
a good view could be obtained of Cape Bird, and from the height
we could see Castle Rock to the south, distant about eighteen
miles from the winter quarters. The walk from Hut Point to Castle
Rock was familiar to us on the last expedition. It seemed much
nearer than it really was, for in the Antarctic the distances are
most deceptive, curiously different effects being produced by the
variations of light and the distortion of mirage.</p>

<small>34. THE VICINITY OF CAPE ROYDS. A SCENE OF
DESOLATION</small></p>
<p>As time went on we felt more and more satisfied with our
location, for there was work of interest for every one. The
Professor and Priestley saw open before them a new chapter of
geological history of great interest, for Cape Royds was a
happier hunting ground for the geologist than was Hut Point.
Hundreds of erratic boulders lay scattered on the slopes of the
adjacent hills, and from these the geologists hoped to learn
something of the past conditions of Ross Island. For Murray, the
lakes were a fruitful field for new research. The gradually
deepening bay was full of marine animal life, the species varying
with the depth, and here also an inexhaustible treasure-ground
stretched before the biologist. Adams, the meteorologist, could
not complain, for Mount Erebus was in full view of the
meteorological station, and this fortunate proximity to Erebus
and its smoke-cloud led, in a large measure, to important results
in this branch. For the physicist the structure of the ice,
varying on various lakes, the different salts in the earth, and
the magnetic conditions of the rocks claimed investigation,
though, indeed, the magnetic nature of the rocks proved a
disadvantage in carrying out magnetic observations, for the
delicate instruments were often affected by the local attraction.
From every point of view I must say that we were extremely
fortunate in the winter quarters to which we had been led by the
state of the sea ice, for no other spot could have afforded more
scope for work and exercise.</p>

<br>
<small>36. HIGH HILL, NEAR THE WINTER QUARTERS. A LAVA FLOW IS
SEEN IN THE FOREGROUND</small></p>
<p>Before we had been ten days ashore the hut was practically
completed, though it was over a month before it had been worked
up from the state of an empty shell to attain the fully furnished
appearance it assumed after every one had settled down and
arranged his belongings. It was not a very spacious dwelling for
the accommodation of fifteen persons, but our narrow quarters
were warmer than if the hut had been larger. The coldest part of
the house when we first lived in it was undoubtedly the floor,
which was formed of inch tongue-and-groove boarding, but was not
double-lined. There was a space of about four feet under the hut
at the north-west end, the other end resting practically on the
ground, and it was obvious to us that as long as this space
remained we would suffer from the cold, so we decided to make an
airlock of the area under the hut. To this end we decided to
build a wall round the south-east and southerly sides, which were
to windward, with the bulk of the provision cases. To make
certain that no air would penetrate from these sides we built the
first two or three tiers of cases a little distance out from the
walls of the hut, pouring in volcanic earth until no gaps could
be seen, and the earth was level with the cases; then the rest of
the stores were piled up to a height of six or seven feet. This
accounted for one side and one end. On either side of the porch
two other buildings were gradually erected. One, built out of
biscuit cases, the roof covered with felt and canvas, was a
store-room for Wild, who looked after the issue of all
foodstuffs. The building on the other side of the porch was a
much more ambitious affair, and was built by Mawson, to serve as
a chemical and physical laboratory. It was destined, however, to
be used solely as a store-room, for the temperature within its
walls was practically the same as that of the outside air, and
the warm, moist atmosphere rushing out from the hut covered
everything inside this store-room with fantastic ice
crystals.</p>
<p>The lee side of the hut ultimately became the wall of the
stables, for we decided to keep the ponies sheltered during the
winter. During the blizzard we experienced on February 18, and
for the three following days, the animals suffered somewhat,
mainly owing to the knocking about they had received whilst on
the way south in the ship. We found that a shelter, not
necessarily warmed to a high temperature, would keep the ponies
in better condition than if they were allowed to stand in the
open, and by February 9 the stable building was complete. A
double row of cases of maize, built at one end to a height of
five feet eight inches, made one end, and then the longer side of
the shelter was composed of bales of fodder. A wide plank at the
other end was cemented into the ground, and a doorway left. Over
all this was stretched the canvas tarpaulin which we had
previously used in the fodder hut, and with planks and battens on
both side to make it windproof, the stable was complete. A wire
rope was stretched from one end to the other on the side nearest
to the hut, and the ponies' head-ropes were made fast to this.
The first night that they were placed in the stable there was
little rest for any of us, and during the night some of the
animals broke loose and returned to their valley. Shortly
afterwards Grisi, one of the most high-spirited of the lot,
pushed his head through a window, so the lower halves of the but
windows had to be boarded up. The first strong breeze we had
shook the roof of the stable so much that we expected every
moment it would blow away, so after the gale all the sledges
except those which were in use were laid on the top of the
stable, and a stout rope passed from one end to the other. The
next snowfall covered the sledges and made a splendid roof, upon
which no subsequent wind had any effect. Later, another addition
was made to the dwellings outside the hut in the shape of a
series of dog-houses for those animals about to pup, and as that
was not an uncommon thing down there, the houses were constantly
occupied.</p>

<br>
<small>37. LOOKING NORTH TOWARDS CAPE ROYDS, FROM CAPE BARNE. THE
SMOOTH ICE SHOWN WAS THE EXERCISING GROUND FOR THE PONIES DURING
THE SPRING</small></p>
<p>On the south-east side of the hut a store-room was built,
constructed entirely of cases, and roofed with hammocks sewn
together. Here we kept the tool chest, shoemakers' outfit, which
was in constant requisition, and any general stores that had to
be issued at stated times. The first heavy blizzard found this
place out, and after the roof had been blown off, the wall fell
down, and we had to organise a party, when the weather got fine,
to search for anything that might be lost, such as mufflers,
woollen helmets, and so on. Some things were blown more than a
mile away. I found a Russian felt boot, weighing five pounds,
lying three-quarters of a mile from the crate in which it had
been stowed, and it must have had a clear run in the air for the
whole of this distance, for there was not a scratch on the
leather; if it had been blown along the rocks, which lay in the
way, the leather would certainly have been scratched all over.
The chimney, which was an iron pipe, projecting two or three feet
above the roof of the hut, and capped by a cowl, was let through
the roof at the south-east end, and secured by numerous rope
stays supporting it at every point from which the wind could
blow.</p>
<p>We were quite free from the trouble of down draughts or
choking with snow, such as had been of common occurrence in the
large hut on the <i>Discovery</i> expedition. Certainly the
revolving cowl blew off during the first blizzard, and this
happened again in the second, so we took the hint and left it off
for good, without detriment, as it happened, to the efficiency of
the stove.</p>
<p>The dog kennels were placed close to the porch of the hut, but
only three of the dogs were kept constantly chained up. The
meteorological station was on the weather side of the hut on the
top of a small ridge, about twenty feet above the hut and forty
feet above sea-level, and a natural path led to it. Adams laid it
out, and the regular readings of the instruments began on March
22. The foundation of the thermometer screen consisted of a heavy
wooden case resting on rocks. The case was three-quarters filled
with rock, and round the outside were piled more blocks of
kenyte; the crevices between them were filled with volcanic earth
on to which water was poured, the result being a structure as
rigid as the ground itself. On each side of the box a heavy
upright was secured by the rocks inside the case and by bolts at
the sides, and to these uprights the actual meteorological
screen, one of the Stevenson pattern and of standard size, was
bolted. As readings of the instruments were to be taken day and
night at intervals of two hours, and as it was quite possible
that the weather might be so thick that a person might be lost in
making his way between the screen and the hut, a line was rigged
up on posts which were cemented into the ground by ice, so that
in the thickest weather the observer could be sure of finding his
way by following this very substantial clue.</p>

<br>
<h3>FIRST DAYS IN WINTER QUARTERS</h3>
<p><b>THE</b> inside of the hut was not long in being fully
furnished, and a great change it was from the bare shell of our
first days of occupancy. The first thing done was to peg out a
space for each individual, and we saw that the best plan would be
to have the space allotted in sections, allowing two persons to
share one cubicle. This space for two men amounted to six feet
six inches in length and seven feet in depth from the wall of the
hut towards the centre. There were seven of these cubicles, and a
space for the leader of the expedition; thus providing for the
fifteen who made up the shore-party. The accompanying photographs
will give an idea of the hut as finished. One of the most
important parts of the interior construction was the darkroom for
the photographers. We were very short of wood, so cases of
bottled fruit, which had to be kept inside the hut to prevent
them freezing, were utilised for building the walls. The darkroom
was constructed in the left-hand corner of the hut as one
entered, and the fruit cases were turned with their lids facing
out, so that the contents could be removed without demolishing
the walls of the building. These cases, as they were emptied,
were turned into lockers, where we stowed our spare gear and so
obtained more room in the little cubicles. The interior of the
darkroom was fitted up by Mawson and the Professor. The sides and
roof were lined with the felt left over after the hut was
completed. Mawson made the fittings complete in every detail,
with shelves, tanks, &amp;c., and the result was as good as any
one could desire in the circumstances.</p>
<p>On the other side of the doorway, opposite the darkroom, was
my room, six feet long, seven feet deep, built of boards and
roofed, the roof being seven feet above the floor. I lined the
walls inside with canvas, and the bed-place was constructed of
fruit boxes, which, when emptied, served, like those outside, for
lockers. My room contained the bulk of our library, the
chronometers, the chronometer watches, barograph, and the
electric-recording thermometer; there was ample room for a table,
and the whole made a most comfortable cabin. On the roof we
stowed those of our scientific instruments which were not in use,
such as theodolites, spare thermometers, dip circles, &amp;c. The
gradual accumulation of weight produced a distinct sag in the
roof, which sometimes seemed to threaten collapse as I sat
inside, but no notice was taken, and nothing happened. On the
roof of the darkroom we stowed all our photographic gear and our
few cases of wine, which were only drawn upon on special
occasions, such as Midwinter Day. The acetylene gas-plant was set
up on a platform between my room and the darkroom. We had tried
to work it from the porch, but the temperature was so low there
that the water froze and the gas would not come, so we shifted it
inside the hut, and had no further trouble. Four burners,
including a portable standard light in my room, gave ample
illumination. The simplicity and portability of the apparatus and
the high efficiency of the light represented the height of luxury
under polar conditions and did much to render our sojourn more
tolerable than would have been possible in earlier days. The
particular form that we used was supplied by Mr. Morrison, who
had been chief engineer on the Morning on her voyage to the
relief of the <i>Discovery</i>. The only objectionable feature,
due to having the generating-plant in our living room, was the
unpleasant smell given off when the carbide tanks were being
recharged, but we soon got used to this, though the daily
changing always drew down strong remarks on the unlucky head of
Day--who had the acetylene plant especially under his charge. He
did not have a hitch with it all the time. Flexible steel tubes
were carried from the tank, and after being wound round the beams
of the roof, served to suspend the lights at the required
positions.</p>
<p>A long ridge of rope wire was stretched from one end of the
hut to the other on each side, seven feet out from the wall; then
at intervals of six feet another wire was brought out from the
wall of the hut, and made fast to the fore and aft wire. These
lines marked the boundaries of the cubicles, and sheets of duck
sewn together hung from them, making a good division. Blankets
were served out to hang in the front of the cubicle, in case the
inhabitants wanted at any time to "sport their oak". As each of
the cubicles had distinctive features in the furnishing and
general design, especially as regards beds, it is worth while to
describe them fully. This is not so trivial a matter as it may
appear to some readers, for during the winter months the inside
of the hut was the whole inhabited world to us. The wall of
Adams' and Marshall's cubicle, which was next to my room, was
fitted with shelves made out of Venesta cases, and there was so
much neatness and order about this apartment that it was known by
the address, "No. 1 Park Lane". In front of the shelves hung
little gauze curtains, tied up with blue ribbon, and the literary
tastes of the occupants could be seen at a glance from the
bookshelves. In Adams' quarter the period of the French
Revolution and the Napoleonic era filled most of his bookshelves,
though a complete edition of Dickens came in a good second.
Marshall's shelves were stocked with bottles of medicine, medical
works, and some general literature. The dividing curtain of duck
was adorned by Marston with life-sized coloured drawings of
Napoleon and Joan of Arc. Adams and Marshall did Sandow exercises
daily, and their example was followed by other men later on, when
the darkness and bad weather made open-air work difficult. The
beds of this particular cubicle were the most comfortable in the
hut, but took a little longer to rig up at night than most of the
others. This disadvantage was more than compensated for by the
free space gained during the day, and by permission of the owners
it was used as consulting-room, dispensary, and operating
theatre. The beds consisted of bamboos lashed together for extra
strength, to which strips of canvas were attached, so that each
bed looked like a stretcher. The wall end rested on stout cleats
screwed on to the side of the hut, the other ends on chairs, and
so supported, the occupants slept soundly and comfortably.</p>
<p>The next cubicle on the same side was occupied by Marston and
Day, and as the former was the artist and the latter the general
handy man of the expedition, one naturally found an ambitious
scheme of decoration. The shelves were provided with beading, and
the Venesta boxes were stained brown. This idea was copied from
No. 1 Park Lane, where they had stained all their walls with
Condy's Fluid. Marston's and Day's cubicle was known as "The
Gables", presumably from the gabled appearance of the shelves.
Solid wooden beds, made out of old packing-cases and upholstered
with wood shavings covered with blankets, made very comfortably
couches, one of which could be pushed during meal times out of
the way of the chairs. The artist's curtain was painted to
represent a fireplace and mantelpiece in civilisation; a cheerful
fire burned in the grate, and a bunch of flowers stood on the
mantelpiece. The dividing curtain between it and No. 1 Park Lane,
on the other side of the cubicle, did not require to be
decorated, for the colour of Joan of Arc, and also portions of
Napoleon, had oozed through the canvas. In The Gables was set up
the lithographic press, which was used for producing pictures for
the book which was printed at our winter quarters.</p>
<p>The next cubicle on the same side belonged to Armytage and
Brocklehurst. Here everything in the way of shelves and fittings
was very primitive. I lived in Brocklehurst's portion of the
cubicle for two months, as he was laid up in my room, and before
I left it I constructed a bed of empty petrol cases. The smell
from these for the first couple of nights after rigging them up
was decidedly unpleasant, but it disappeared after a while. Next
to Brocklehurst's and Armytage's quarters came the pantry. The
division between the cubicle and the pantry consisted of a tier
of cases, making a substantial wall between the food and the
heads of the sleepers. The pantry, bakery, and store-room, all
combined, measured six feet by three, not very spacious,
certainly, but sufficient to work in. The far end of the hut
constituted the other wall of the pantry, and was lined with
shelves up to the slope of the roof. These shelves were continued
along the wall behind the stove, which stood about four feet out
from the end of the house, and an erection of wooden battens and
burlap or sacking concealed the biological laboratory. The space
taken up by this important department was four feet by four, but
lack of ground area was made up for by the shelves, which
contained dozens of bottles soon to be filled with Murray's
biological captures.</p>
<p>Beyond the stove, facing the pantry, was Mackay's and Roberts'
cubicle, the main feature of which was a ponderous shelf, on
which rested mostly socks and other light articles, the only
thing of weight being our gramophone and records. The bunks were
somewhat feeble imitations of those belonging to No. 1 Park Lane,
and the troubles that the owners went through before finally
getting them into working order afforded the rest of the
community a good deal of amusement. I can see before me now the
triumphant face of Mackay, as he called all hands round to see
his design. The inhabitants of No. 1 Park Lane pointed out that
the bamboo was not a rigid piece of wood, and that when Mackay's
weight came on it the middle would bend and the ends would jump
off the supports unless secured. Mackay undressed before a
critical audience, and he got into his bag and expatiated on the
comfort and luxury he was experiencing, so different to the hard
boards he had been lying on for months. Roberts was anxious to
try his couch, which was constructed on the same principle, and
the audience were turning away disappointed at not witnessing a
catastrophe, when suddenly a crash was heard, followed by a
strong expletive. Mackay's bed was half on the ground, one end of
it resting at a most uncomfortable angle. Laughter and pointed
remarks as to his capacity for making a bed were nothing to him;
he tried three times that night to fix it up, but at last had to
give it up for a bad job. In due time he arranged fastenings, and
after that he slept in comfort.</p>

<br>
<small>39. CAPE BARNE. THE PILLAR IN THE RIGHT FOREGROUND IS
VOLCANIC</small></p>
<p>Between this cubicle and the next there was no division,
neither party troubling about the matter. The result was that the
four men were constantly at war regarding alleged encroachments
on their ground. Priestley, who was long-suffering, and who
occupied the cubicle with Murray, said he did not mind a chair or
a volume of the "Encyclopaedia Britannica" being occasionally
deposited on him while he was asleep, but that he thought it was
a little too strong to drop wet boots, newly arrived from the
stables, on top of his belongings. Priestley and Murray had no
floor-space at all in their cubicle, as their beds were built of
empty dog-biscuit boxes. A division of boxes separated the two
sleeping-places, and the whole cubicle was garnished on
Priestley's side with bits of rock, ice-axes, hammers and
chisels, and on Murray's with biological requisites.</p>
<p>Next came one of the first cubicles that had been built. Joyce
and Wild occupied the "Rogues' Retreat", a painting of two very
tough characters drinking beer out of pint mugs, with the
inscription The Rogues' Retreat painted underneath, adorning the
entrance to the den. The couches in this house were the first to
be built, and those of the opposite dwelling, The Gables, were
copied from their design. The first bed had been built in Wild's
store-room for secrecy's sake; it was to burst upon the view of
every one, and to create mingled feelings of admiration and envy,
admiration for the splendid design, envy of the unparalleled
luxury provided by it. However, in building it, the designer
forgot the size of the doorway he had to take it through, and it
had ignominiously to be sawn in half before it could be passed
out of the store-room into the hut. The printing press and type
case for the polar paper occupied one corner of this cubicle.</p>
<p>The next and last compartment was the dwelling-place of the
Professor and Mawson. It would be difficult to do justice to the
picturesque confusion of this compartment; one hardly likes to
call it untidy, for the things that covered the bunks by daytime
could be placed nowhere else conveniently. A miscellaneous
assortment of cameras, spectroscopes, thermometers, microscopes,
electrometers and the like lay in profusion on the blankets.
Mawson's bed consisted of his two boxes, in which he had stowed
his scientific apparatus on the way down, and the Professor's bed
was made out of kerosene cases. Everything in the way of tin cans
or plug-topped, with straw wrappers belonging to the fruit
bottles, was collected by these two scientific men. Mawson, as a
rule, put his possessions in his store-room outside, but the
Professor, not having any retreat like that, made a pile of
glittering tins and coloured wrappers at one end of his bunk, and
the heap looked like the nest of the Australian bower bird. The
straw and the tins were generally cleared away when the Professor
and Priestley went in for a day's packing of geological
specimens; the straw wrappers were utilised for wrapping round
the rocks, and the tins were filled with paper wrapped round the
more delicate geological specimens. The name given, though not by
the owners, to this cubicle was "The Pawn Shop", for not only was
there always a heterogeneous mass of things on the bunks, but the
wall of the darkroom and the wall of the hut at this spot could
not be seen for the multitude of cases ranged as shelves and
filled with a varied assortment of notebooks and instruments.</p>
<p>In order to give as much free space as possible in the centre
of the hut we had the table so arranged that it could be hoisted
up over our heads after meals were over. This gave ample room for
the various carpentering and engineering efforts that were
constantly going on. Murray built the table out of the lids of
packing-cases, and though often scrubbed, the stencilling on the
cases never came out. We had no tablecloth, but this was an
advantage, for a well-scrubbed table had a cleaner appearance
than would be obtained with such washing as could be done in an
Antarctic laundry. The legs of the table were detachable, being
after the fashion of trestles, and the whole affair, when meals
were over, was slung by a rope at each end about eight feet from
the floor. At first we used to put the boxes containing knives,
forks, plates and bowls on top of the table before hauling it up,
but after these had fallen on the unfortunate head of the person
trying to get them down, we were content to keep them on the
floor.</p>
<p>I had been very anxious as regards the stove, the most
important part of the hut equipment, when I heard that, after the
blizzard that kept me on board the <i>Nimrod</i>, the temperature
of the hut was below zero, and that socks put to dry in the
baking-ovens came out as damp as ever the following morning. My
anxiety was dispelled after the stove had been taken to pieces
again, for it was found that eight important pieces of its
structure had not been put in. As soon as this omission was
rectified the stove acted splendidly, and the makers deserve our
thanks for the particular apparatus they picked out as suitable
for us. The stove was put to a severe test, for it was kept going
day and night for over nine months without once being out for
more than ten minutes, when occasion required it to be cleaned.
It supplied us with sufficient heat to keep the temperature of
the hut sixty to seventy degrees above the outside air. Enough
bread could be baked to satisfy our whole hungry party of fifteen
every day; three hot meals a day were also cooked, and water
melted from ice at a temperature of perhaps twenty degrees below
zero in sufficient quantity to afford as much as we required for
ourselves, and to water the ponies twice a day, and all this work
was done on a consumption not exceeding five hundredweight of
coal per week. After testing the stove by running it on an
accurately measured amount of coal for a month, we were reassured
about our coal supply being sufficient to carry us through the
winter right on to sledging time.</p>
<p>As the winter came on and the light grew faint outside, the
hut became more and more like a workshop, and it seems strange to
me now, looking back to those distant days, to remember the
amount of trouble and care that was taken to furnish and beautify
what was only to be a temporary home. One of our many kind
friends had sent us a number of pictures, which were divided
between the various cubicles, and these brightened up the place
wonderfully. During our first severe blizzard, the hut shook and
trembled so that every moment we expected the whole thing to
carry away, and there is not the slightest shadow of a doubt that
if we had been located in the open, the hut and everything in it
would have been torn up and blown away. Even with our sheltered
position I had to lash the chronometers to the shelf in my room,
for they were apt to be shaken off when the walls trembled in the
gale. When the storm was over we put a stout wire cable over the
hut, burying the ends in the ground and freezing them in, so as
to afford additional security in case heavier weather was in
store for us in the future.</p>

<h3>SLEDGING EQUIPMENT: PONIES AND DOGS</h3>
<p><b>AT</b> the commencement of this narrative I gave some
general information regarding our equipment and provisioning, but
it will now be necessary to describe more fully the sledging
outfits used by the various expeditions that left our winter
quarters. The first, and one of the most important of the items
was, of course, the sledge, though, indeed, everything taken on a
sledge journey is absolutely essential; one does not load up odds
and ends on the chance of their proving useful, for the utmost
reduction of weight compatible with efficiency is the first and
last thing for the polar explorer to aim at. The sledge which we
used is the outcome of the experience of many former explorers,
but it is chiefly due to Nansen that it has become the very
useful vehicle that it is at the present day. On the
<i>Discovery</i> expedition we had sledges of various lengths,
seven feet, nine feet, eleven feet and twelve feet. Our
experience on that occasion showed that the eleven-foot sledge
was the best for all-round use, but I had taken with me a certain
number of twelve-foot sledges as being possibly more suitable for
pony traction. A good sledge for Antarctic or Arctic travelling
must be rigid in its upright and crossbars, and yet give to
uneven surfaces, so that in travelling over sastrugi the strain
will not come on the whole of the sledge. A well-constructed
sledge, travelling over an uneven surface, appears to have an
undulating, snake-like movement, and the attainment of this
suppleness without interfering with the strength of the structure
as a whole, is the main point to be aimed at; in our case there
was nothing wanting in this respect.</p>
<p>The wooden runners were about four inches wide and made of
hickory, split from the tree with the grain of the wood and not
sawn. Many pieces were inspected and rejected and only those
passed as perfect were used. This method of preparing the
runners, it can easily be seen, allows much greater scope for
bending than would be the case if the wood were sawn regardless
of the run of the grain. In pulling the sledge the direction of
the grain on the snow surface has to be observed, and it is
wonderful what a difference it makes whether one is pulling with
or against the grain of the runner. The second point to consider
is the height of the framework of the sledge above the surface of
the snow. Naturally, with a low framework there is less chance of
the sledge-load capsizing when passing over rough ground, and the
aim of the explorer is therefore to keep the load as low as
possible on the sledge. It has been found that a clearance of six
inches is ample in all ordinary circumstances, so the uprights of
our sledges were only about six inches high. These uprights were
fastened at intervals into holes on the upper side of the
runners, and instead of being fastened on the underside of the
latter, other holes were bored in the ridge on the upper side and
raw hide lashings passed through them and through the upright.
Crosspieces were fastened by a sort of dovetailing process,
supplemented by marlin lashings, and the angle made by the
vertical upright and horizontal crosspiece was crossed by a short
iron stay. This junction of crosspiece and upright was the only
absolutely rigid part of the whole sledge. Every other portion of
a good sledge gives somewhat as it takes up the various strains,
and it entirely depends on good workmanship and sailor-like
lashings whether, on the strain being removed, the sledge returns
to its normal shape or is permanently distorted. Two long runners
or bearers, about an inch square, rested on the uprights, and
crosspieces projecting the whole length of the sledge and
fastened by extra strong marlin lashings, covered with leather to
protect them from the chafing of the equipment stowed on top,
formed a sort of platform on which the stores were placed. The
fore end of the sledge had a bow of wood, forming practically a
semi-circle, the two ends being fastened to the slightly upturned
ends of the runners. The upper bearers were pressed down, and
also lashed to this bow. This upturning at the forward end of the
sledge allowed for the meeting of unequal surfaces, and the shape
of the bow was intended to prevent the ends of the sledge being
driven into snow or ice obstructions. The rear end of the sledge
was also slightly turned up, and the top bearers bent down and
lashed to the bare ends. Of course, a bow was not necessary at
that end. At each end of the sledge, made fast round the first
two uprights and the last two on both sides, were two pieces of
alpine rope, which combines strength with lightness. The bight of
this rope was formed into a bucket, and by this means a toggle
attached to the sledge harness could be readily put in. When
sledges are running in line, one behind the other, particular
care has to be taken with these ropes, so that the tracks of the
second sledge coincide with the first. By doing this the amount
of friction on the runners of the second sledge is greatly
reduced, for the forward sledge does practically all the work of
breaking the trail, and the following ones run lightly over the
made track. An eleven-foot sledge, fully loaded, is at its best
working weight with about 650 lb. on it, but this by no means
represents its actual strength capacity, for we tested ours most
rigorously during the unloading of the ship, often placing over a
thousand pounds' weight on a sledge without it sustaining the
slightest damage. After our experience on the Barrier surface
during the <i>Discovery</i> expedition, I had decided to dispense
with metal runners, so only a few sets of detachable steel
under-runners were provided, to be used for work on ground bare
of snow or on rough glacier ice. In order to fasten the stores on
the sledge we riveted straps on to the bearers, and thus formed a
handy and trustworthy means of fastening things with the least
possible loss of time.</p>

<br>
<small>41. A GREAT KENYTE BOULDER CLOSE TO THE WINTER
QUARTERS</small></p>
<p>Another vitally important article of equipment for the polar
explorer is the cooker and cooking-stove. Here again we were
indebted to the practical genius of Nansen, who designed the form
of cooker that is now invariably used in polar work. The stove
was the ordinary "primus", burning kerosene, vapourised in the
usual way. This stove is highly efficient, and, with strict
economy, one gallon of oil will last three men for ten days,
allowing three hot meals per day. This economy is due, in a large
measure, to the qualities of the cooker. The form we used
consisted of an outer cover of aluminium drawn out of one piece,
inside which was a ring-shaped vessel so designed that the heated
air could circulate round it. Inside this vessel was the centre
cooking-pot, and these pots were all mounted on a concave plate
of aluminium which fitted over the top of the primus lamp. The
middle cooker was first filled with snow or ice, pressed tightly
down, the lid was put on and this vessel placed inside the outer,
ring-shaped cooker, which was also filled with snow; over all
this apparatus the aluminium outside cover was placed, inverted.
The heated gases from the stove, after heating the bottom of the
centre cooker, mounted into the space between the two vessels,
and were then forced down the outside of the ring-shaped cooker
by the cover, finally escaping at the lower edge. Experiments
showed that about 92 per cent. of the heat generated by the lamp
was used in the cooker, a most satisfactory result, for economy
in fuel is of great importance when the oil has to be carried on
sledges. I did not have draw-off taps on the cookers, but they
were so arranged that the boiling-pot in the centre lifted in and
out easily. Such was the efficiency of the cooker and stove that,
in a temperature of forty or fifty degrees below zero, the snow
or ice, which would be at this temperature, could be melted and a
hot meal prepared within half an hour from the time the cooker
was first placed on the primus. The whole apparatus, including
the primus, did not weigh more than fifteen pounds. When the
cooker was empty after meals, our feeding utensils were placed
inside. They consisted of pannikins and spoons only. The former
were made of aluminium in pairs, and fitted one into another. The
outer pannikin, for holding the hot tea or cocoa, was provided
with handles, and the other fitted over the top of this and was
used for the more solid food. There was no "washing up" on the
march, for spoons were licked clean and pannikins scraped
assiduously when sledging appetites had been developed.</p>
<p>The next important item was the tent. The usual unit for
sledging consists of three men, and our tents were designed to
contain that number. The tent cloth was thin Willesden duck, with
a "snow cloth" of thicker material round the lower edge. This
snow cloth was spread out on the ground and snow or ice piled on
it so that the form of the tent was like that of an inverted
convolvulus. Instead of a single tent pole we used five male
bamboo rods, eight feet six inches in length, fastened together
at one end in a cap, over which the apex of the tent fitted. The
bamboos were stretched out, and the tent was slung over the top,
with the door, which took the form of a sort of spout of Burberry
material, on the lee side. This Burberry spout was loose and
could be tied up by being gathered together when the occupants
were inside the tent, or could be left open when desired. Inside
the tent was placed on the snow a circle of thick Willesden
waterproof canvas to protect the sleeping-bags from actual
contact with the ground. The material of which the tents were
constructed appeared flimsy and the bamboos were light, but one
could trust them with absolute confidence to encounter
successfully the fiercest blizzards of this exceptionally stormy
part of the world. There was no instance of damage to a tent
owing to bad weather during the expedition.</p>
<p>The next important item of our equipment was the sleeping-bag.
It has been generally assumed by polar explorers, despite our
experience with the <i>Discovery</i> expedition, that it is
absolutely necessary for sledge travellers to wrap themselves up
in furs. We have found this to be quite unnecessary, and I think
that I am justified, from my experience during two expeditions in
what is, undoubtedly, a more rigorous climate than exists in the
north polar regions, in stating that, except for the hands and
feet, in the way of personal clothing, and the sleeping-bags for
camping, furs are entirely unnecessary. Our sleeping-bags, as I
have already stated, were made of hides of young reindeer. The
hide of the young reindeer is the most comfortable fur that can
be used for this purpose, being very close and thick. The term
"bag" literally describes this portion of the sledging-gear. It
is a long bag, with closely sewn seams, and is entered by means
of a slit at the upper end. A flap comes down over the head of
the occupant, and a toggle on the flap fastens into an eye at the
mouth of the bag; thus secured, one can sleep in more or less
comfort, according to the temperature.</p>

<br>
<small>42. A FRESHWATER LAKE NEAR CAPE BARNE, FROZEN TO A DEPTH
OF TWENTY FEET. ROTIFERS WERE FOUND IN THIS LAKE</small></p>
<p>The clothing usually worn for sledging-work consisted of thick
Jaeger underclothing, heavy blue pilot-cloth trousers, a Jaeger
pyjama jacket for coat, and over this, as our main protection
against cold and wind, the Burberry blouse and trousers. On the
hands we wore woollen gloves and then fur mits, and on the feet
several pair of heavy woollen socks and then finnesko. Any one
feeling the texture and lightness of the Burberry material would
hardly believe that it answers so well in keeping out the cold
and wind and in offering, during a blizzard, a complete
protection against the fine drifting snow that permeates almost
everything. Some of our party wore a pair of Burberry trousers
over the Jaeger underclothing throughout the winter, and did not
feel the need of the cloth trousers at all. The headgear, which
is another item of one's equipment, especially important as
regards comfort, was a matter upon which there were marked
differences of opinion. The most general method of keeping the
head and ears warm was to wrap a woollen muffler twice round the
chin and head, thus forming protection for the ears, which are
the first part of the body to show signs of frostbite; the
muffler was then brought round one's neck, and over the muffler
was pulled what is known as a fleecy travelling cap, a woollen
helmet, in appearance something like an old-time helmet without
the visor. If a blizzard were blowing the muffler was discarded,
the helmet put on, and over this the Burberry helmet, which has a
stiff flap in front that can be buttoned into a funnel shape. The
helmet and the fur mits were made fast to a length of lampwick,
which was tied round the neck, so that they could be removed
temporarily without fear of being lost. The sledge traveller
wearing this gear could be assured that his features and body
would be exempt from frostbite under all ordinary circumstances.
Of course, in very low temperatures, or with a moderately low
temperature and a breeze blowing, it was necessary occasionally
to inspect each others' faces for the sign of frostbite, and if
the white patch which denotes this was visible, it had to be
attended to at once.</p>

<small>43. A GROUP OF THE SHORE-PARTY AT THE WINTER QUARTERS
<i>Standing</i> (from left): Joyce, Day, Wild, Adams,
Brocklehurst, Shackleton, Marshall, David, Armytage, Marston.
<i>Sitting</i>: Priestley, Murray, Roberts</small></p>
<p>Having considered the clothing, camping and cooking-equipment
of a sledge-party we now come to the important item of food. The
appetite of a man who has just come to camp after a five hours'
march in a low temperature is a thing that the ordinary
individual at home would hardly understand, and, indeed, the
sledger himself has moments of surprise when, after finishing his
ration, he feels just about as hungry as when he started. Much
has been written on the subject of food in most books on polar
exploration, and in Captain Scott's account of the
<i>Discovery</i> expedition this matter is dealt with in an
interesting and exhaustive manner. In selecting our supplies I
had based my plans on the experience gained by the previous
expedition, and for the sledging journeys I had tried to provide
the maximum amount of heat-giving and flesh-forming materials,
and to avoid as far as possible foods containing a large amount
of moisture, which means so much dead weight to be carried. Our
cuisine was not very varied, but a voracious appetite has no nice
discernment and requires no sauce to make the meal palatable;
indeed, all one wants is more, and this is just what cannot be
allowed if a party is to achieve anything in the way of distance
whilst confined to man-haulage. It is hard for a hungry man to
rest content with the knowledge that the particular food he is
eating contains so much nourishment and is sufficient for his
needs, if at the same time he does not feel full and satisfied
after the meal and if, within an hour or so, the aching void
again makes itself felt, and he has to wait another five hours
before he can again temporarily satisfy the craving. One of the
main items of our food supply was pemmican, which consisted of
the finest beef powdered with 60 per cent. of fat added. This is
one of the staple foods in polar work, and the fat has properties
specially tending to promote heat. Our pemmican for use on the
long sledge journeys was obtained from Messrs. Beauvais, of
Copenhagen, and was similar to the pemmican we had on the
<i>Discovery</i> expedition. Biscuits are a standard food also,
and in this matter I had made a departure from the example of the
previous expedition. We found then that the thin wholemeal
biscuits which we used in sledging work were apt to break, and it
was difficult to make out the exact allowance for each day, the
result being that sometimes we used up our supply for the week
too early. I secured thicker biscuits, but the principal change
was in the composition itself. The Plasmon Company supplied a ton
of the best wholemeal biscuit, containing 25 per cent. of
plasmon; the plasmon tended to harden the biscuit, and, as is
well known, it is an excellent food. These biscuits were
specially baked, and, with an allowance of one pound for each man
per day, were a distinct advance on the farinaceous food of the
previous expedition. This allowance, I may mention, was reduced
very considerably when food began to run short on the southern
and northern journeys, but we had no fault to find with the
quality of the biscuits. The addition of the plasmon certainly
increased their food value. Tea and cocoa were selected as our
beverages for use on the march. We used tea for breakfast and
lunch, and cocoa, which tends to produce sleepiness, for dinner
at night. Sugar is a very valuable heat-forming substance, and
our allowance of this amounted to about a third of a pound for
each man for a day. We also took chocolate, cheese and oatmeal,
so that, though there was not very much variety, we felt we were
getting the most nutritious food possible. We had a much more
varied selection of foods at the winter quarters, and the
supplies taken on the sledging journeys could be varied to some
extent according to the necessities of the occasion.</p>
<p>In considering the various methods of haulage in the Antarctic
the experience of the National Antarctic Expedition proved of
very great value. Until the <i>Discovery</i> wintered at the head
of McMurdo Sound no sledge journey had been made over the surface
of the Great Ice Barrier, and, indeed, when the <i>Discovery</i>
left England there was an idea amongst many of the best
authorities that very little sledging would be necessary. It was
thought that the main part of the exploration would be undertaken
by the ship itself. Preparations had been made in the event of a
landing, and the equipment, as far as the sledges, harness, and
so on, were concerned, was excellent. The expedition was
dependent, however, on dogs for haulage purposes, and the use of
these animals on the Barrier was not at all successful. Only
twenty dogs were taken with the <i>Discovery</i> and the trouble
they gave and their eventual collapse and failure are matters of
common knowledge amongst those interested in Antarctic
exploration. The knowledge I gained of the Barrier surface on
that occasion suggested to me the feasibility of using ponies for
traction purposes, for I had heard that in Siberia and Northern
Manchuria ponies of a peculiarly hardy and sturdy stock did
excellent work in hauling sledges and carrying packs over snow
and ice at very low temperatures and under very severe weather
conditions.</p>

<small>44. THE POUR PONIES OUT FOR EXERCISE ON THE SEA
ICE</small></p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-pic045"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>45. INTERIOR OF THE STABLE. FROST CAN BE SEEN ON THE BOLTS
IN THE ROOF</small></p>
<p>It seems to be generally assumed that a Manchurian pony can
drag a sledge over a broken trail at the rate of twenty to thirty
miles a day, pulling not less than twelve hundred pounds. Some
authorities even put the weight to be hauled at eighteen hundred
pounds, but this is, I think, far too heavy a load. It was a risk
to take ponies from the far north through the tropics and then
across two thousand miles of stormy sea on a very small ship, but
I felt that if it could be done it would be well worth the
trouble, for, compared with the dog, the pony is a far more
efficient animal, one pony doing the work of at least ten dogs on
the food allowance for ten dogs, and travelling a longer distance
in a day.</p>
<p>We established ourselves at the winter quarters with eight
ponies, but unfortunately we lost four of them within a month of
our arrival. The loss was due, in the case of three of the four,
to the fact that they were picketed when they first landed on
sandy ground, and it was not noticed that they were eating the
sand. I had neglected to see that the animals had a supply of
salt given to them, and as they found a saline flavour in the
volcanic sand under their feet, due to the fact that the
blizzards had sprayed all the land near the shore with sea water,
they ate it at odd moments. All the ponies seem to have done
this, but some were more addicted to the habit than the others.
Several of them became ill, and we were quite at a loss to
account for the trouble until Sandy died. Then a post-mortem
examination revealed the fact that his stomach contained many
pounds of sand, and the cause of the illness of the other ponies
became apparent. We shifted them at once from the place where
they were picketed, so that they could get no more sand, and gave
them what remedial treatment lay in our power, but two more died
in spite of all our efforts. The loss of the fourth pony was due
to poisoning. The Manchurian ponies will eat anything at all that
can be chewed, and this particular animal seems to have secured
some shavings in which chemicals had been packed. The post-mortem
examination showed that there were distinct signs of corrosive
poisoning. The losses were a matter of deep concern to us.</p>
<p>We were left with four ponies, Quan, Socks, Grisi and
Chinaman, and it is a rather curious fact that the survivors were
the white or light-coloured animals, while disaster had befallen
all the dark animals.</p>
<p>The four ponies were very precious in our eyes, and they were
watched and guarded with keen attention. At first we exercised
them daily by walks across the hills, and later in the season,
when it became too dark to go across the rough ground with
safety, they were exercised up and down the snow-covered lake
known as Green Park close to the hut. Before daylight grew faint
the usual morning walk was over the hills along the sea-coast to
Sandy Beach, where they always had a roll on the soft volcanic
sand, and after this a circuit was made homewards round the
further side of Blue Lake and Back Door Bay. For a change
sometimes they were taken on to the snow slopes and foothills of
Mount Erebus, on the level stretches of which they were ridden,
but this was stopped as soon as there was any fear of them
stumbling in the fading daylight.</p>
<p>During the winter months those of us who generally took the
ponies out for exercise got to learn the different traits and
character of each individual animal. Every one of them seemed to
possess more cunning and sense than the ordinary broken-in horse
at home, and this cunning, when put into practice to gain any end
of their own, was a constant source of petty annoyance to us.
Quan was the worst offender, his particular delight being to bite
through his head rope and attack the bales of fodder stacked
behind him; then, when we put a chain on to prevent this, he
deliberately rattled it against the side of the hut, which kept
us awake. The wall of the hut was sheathed with galvanised iron,
and shortly after the ponies entered the stable, as they started
to gnaw the ropes, a line of wire had been stretched fore and aft
along the stables to which to make fast the head rope. Quan used
to take this line between his teeth and pull back as far as
possible and then let it go with a bang. We tried keeping his
nose-bag on, but within a few hours he would have worked a hole
in this and started again on the rope. On going into the stables
to try and stop his mischief, one's annoyance invariably passed
away on seeing the intelligent look on the delinquent's face, as
he rolled his eye round and leered at one as though to say: "Ha!
Got the best of you again." At last old Quan was tethered by his
fore and hind legs, the ridge rope was taken away, and peace
reigned, as a rule, in the stables. He had at first suffered from
eating sand, and we had to use great care to prevent him getting
at it again, he being greatly addicted to the practice; if he
were given the smallest opportunity down would go his head and he
would be crunching a mouthful of the loose volcanic material.</p>
<p>Grisi was our best-looking pony, with a very pretty action and
in colour a dapple grey; his conduct in the stables, however, was
not friendly to the other ponies and we had to build him a
separate stall in the far corner, as on the slightest provocation
he would lash out with his hind feet. He became rather nervous
and high-strung during the dark months, though we kept a lamp
continually burning in the ponies' quarters. Socks was a pretty
little pony, shaped something like a miniature Clydesdale, very
willing to work and always very fiery. After leading him along
when out walking, it seemed a great change to take great
raw-boned good-natured old Quan, who, in spite of his ugly
appearance, was a general favourite. The last of our remaining
ponies. Chinaman, was a strong beast, sulky in appearance, but in
reality one of the best of the horses; he also had a penchant for
biting through his head rope, but a chain stopped this. When we
first landed we had an idea of not building a stable, as
information from people in Siberia suggested that the ponies were
able to resist cold unsheltered, but after the first blizzard it
was quite obvious that if they were to keep any sort of condition
it would be necessary to stable them. It was not till nearly
August that we were forced to take away part of their house to
feed them with. Our windows on that side of the hut where the
stable stood had been planked over last, the weather side of the
hut having been done much earlier. The lower half of the lee-side
windows had been boarded up, when Grisi put his head through, but
the tops had been left. Amongst the duties of the night watchman
was a two-hourly inspection of the stables, and if he heard any
suspicious noises between inspection time, he had to go out and
investigate the cause. After a couple of months these precautions
became unnecessary, for a little army of pups used to sleep in
the stables during the cold weather, and if by any means a pony
got adrift, they at once surrounded him, barking furiously, and
the noise conveyed to the watchman that the outside watchers had
observed something wrong. I remember one night that Grisi got
free and dashed out of the stables, followed by the whole party
of pups, who rounded him up on the Green Park, and after a
struggle Mackay secured the truant and brought him back, the dogs
following with an air of pride as though conscious of having done
their duty.</p>

<br>
<small>47. SPECIAL MOTOR WHEELS: THE ORIGINAL FORM ON THE LEFT,
AN ALTERED FORM ON THE RIGHT. ORDINARY WHEELS WITH RUBBER TYRES
WERE FOUND TO BE THE MOST SATISFACTORY</small></p>
<p>We had been able to obtain only nine dogs, five bitches and
four dogs, but so prolific were they that before mid-winter we
had a young family of nine pups, five of these being born on the
<i>Nimrod</i>. There were many more births, but most of the
puppies came to an untimely end, there being a marked difference
between the mothers as regards maternal instincts. Gwendoline,
known as the "mad bitch", took no care at all of her pups, whilst
Daisy not only mothered her own but also a surviving puppy
belonging to Gwen, which was taken from her when the culpable
carelessness she had exhibited in the rearing of her offspring
had resulted in the death of the remainder. The younger pups born
at winter quarters did not attain the same size when grown up as
did Possum's pups, born on the <i>Nimrod</i>. This may be due
either to the very cold world they were born into or to the fact
that their mothers were much smaller than Possum. The old dogs
that we brought were kept tied up except when out for exercise or
training in a sledge, for not only did they chase and kill
penguins when we had these birds with us, and hunt placid, stupid
Weddell seals, but two of the best dogs had a violent antipathy
towards each other, and more than once fierce fights took place
in consequence. Tripp, one of our dogs, was pure white in colour,
and was a fine upstanding beast of a very affectionate
disposition. Adams looked after Tripp, taking him for his
sledge-training, whilst Marshall fancied Scamp, who was an older
dog, more set in his bones and with a black-and-white coat. It
was between these two that the battles raged, and I think there
was little to choose between them as far as strength and courage
were concerned. On the occasion of a fight the combatants were
surrounded by all the puppies and a couple of the bitches, the
latter observing the fight with the keenest interest, and I think
some of these battles must be put down to the desire to gain the
approval of the females.</p>
<p>The presence of the dogs around winter quarters and on our
walks was very cheerful, and gave a home-like feeling to the
place, and our interest in the pups was always fresh, for as they
gradually grew up each one developed characteristics and
peculiarities of its own. Names were given to them regardless of
their sex. Roland, for example, did not belong to the sterner
sex, and was in her earlier days a very general favourite. She
had a habit of watching for the door to be opened, and then
launching herself, a white furry ball, into the midst of the
party in the hut. Ambrose, a great big sleepy dog, was so named
by Adams, perhaps owing to his portly proportions, which might
bear resemblance to the well-favoured condition of a monk.
Somehow or another the name Ambrose seemed to suit him. He had a
trick of putting his head between one's legs whenever we were
standing about outside, so when in the dark we felt a dog about
our knees, we knew it was Ambrose. Ambrose had a brother and
sister, but they were nameless, shining only in the reflected
glory of the great Ambrose, being known as "Ambrose's brother" or
"Ambrose's sister". Another white dog was called Sissy, and this
particular animal affected the company of Priestley during his
ice-digging expeditions. Sissy would lie on the ice alongside the
hole that was being dug and was generally rewarded by getting a
biscuit when the scientist did not return to the hut for lunch,
taking it in the open instead. Another popular puppy, also a
female, was called Mercury, because of its rapidity of
movement.</p>

<br>
<small>48. THE START OF A BLIZZARD AT THE WINTER QUARTERS, THE
FUZZY APPEARANCE BEING DUE TO DRIFTING SNOW</small></p>
<p>All the pups were white or would have been white if some of
them had not elected to sleep in the dustbin where the warm ashes
were thrown at night time; indeed, the resting places these
little creatures found were varied and remarkable. In cold
weather they always gravitated to the light and heat of the
stables but if the temperature was not much below zero, they
slept outside, three or four bundled together inside a cork bale,
another squeezed into an empty tin, another in the dustbin, and
so on. Most of them learnt by sad experience the truth of the
ancient words:</p>
<p class="poem">Such are the perils that environ<br>
The man who meddles with cold iron,<br></p>
<p>for sometimes an agonising wail would proceed from a puppy and
the poor little beast would be found with its tongue frozen fast
to a tin in which it had been searching for some succulent
remains. I have mentioned the puppies' usefulness in keeping
watch on the ponies. They did the same service as regards the
older dogs, which were tied up, for if by chance one of these
dogs got adrift, he was immediately pursued by a howling mob of
puppies; when the larger puppies were eventually chained up, the
smaller ones watched them, too, with jealous eye. After enjoying
some months of freedom, it seemed to be a terrible thing to the
young dogs when first a collar was put on and their freedom was
taken from them, and even less did they enjoy the experience of
being taken to the sledge and there taught to pull. I remember
that on the first day the dogs simply lay down in front of the
sledge, so another method was adopted, Ambrose and his brother
being made fast to the rear of the sledge, and pulled willy-nilly
after it. After the training had gone on some time on Green Park,
the dogs were taken further afield and a favourite run was to
Cape Barne and back. The Cape lay about two miles and a quarter
to the south-east of our winter quarters, and with a light load
the dogs would traverse this distance and back again in an
hour.</p>
<p>Our experience on the <i>Discovery</i> expedition, specially
during the long southern journey when we had so much trouble with
our mixed crowd of dogs, rather prejudiced me against these
animals as a means of traction, and we only took them as a
standby in the event of the ponies breaking down. Since we were
reduced to four ponies, it became necessary to consider the dogs
as a possible factor in our work, and so their training was
important. Peary's account of his expeditions show that in the
Arctic regions dogs have been able to traverse long distances
very quickly. In one instance over ninety miles were accomplished
in twenty-three hours, but this evidently had been done on smooth
sea ice or on the smooth glaciated surface of the land, for it
would be impossible to accomplish such a feat on the Antarctic
Barrier surface, where the travelling alternates between hard
sastrugi and soft snow. We were agreeably surprised with the
dogs, for it must be remembered that their forebears had not
lived under polar conditions since 1899 and that none of the
animals had experienced Arctic weather nor were they trained for
the work they had to perform on the ice. Scamp, indeed, had been
a sheepdog, and when out for a walk with the other animals it was
interesting to watch how he retained the habits learnt in
civilisation. He was always "rounding up" the other dogs, and I
think that they enjoyed their walks much more when Scamp was
absent.</p>

<small>49. THE LAST OF THE PENGUINS JUST BEFORE THEIR MIGRATION
IN MARCH. THE ICE IS DRIFTING NORTHWARDS</small></p>
<p>I have described our first attempt to make the motor-car go on
the sea ice. After that we made similar experiments ashore, and
there was no difficulty in starting the engine at a temperature
of ten degrees below zero, but the driving wheels were a great
source of trouble, and the weight of the car itself made it
almost impossible to travel over the snow; the heavy rear wheels
sank into even the hardest snow and then spun round in the hole
they had made for themselves. The car went splendidly on the bare
earth, even up the steep gradient of Pony Glen, and we decided
that when the spring came we would try an alteration of the
wheels. If the car had only been able to travel over the Barrier
surface all our difficulties would have been solved, for a
hundred miles a day would not have been too much to have expected
of it.</p>

<br>
<h3>THE CONQUEST OF MOUNT EREBUS</h3>
<p><b>THE</b> arrangement of all the details relating to settling
in our winter quarters, the final touches to the hut, the
building of the pony stables, and the meteorological screen, and
the collection of stores, engaged our attention up to March 3
Then we began to seek some outlet for our energies that would be
useful in advancing the cause of science, and the work of the
expedition. I was very anxious to make a depot to the south for
the furtherance of our southern journey in the following summer,
but the sheet of open water that intervened between us and Hut
Point forbade all progress in that direction, neither was it
possible for us to make a journey towards the western mountains,
where the geology might have been studied with the probability of
most interesting results.</p>
<p>There was one journey possible, a somewhat difficult
undertaking certainly, yet gaining an interest and excitement
from that very reason, and this was an attempt to reach the
summit of Mount Erebus. For many reasons the accomplishment of
this work seemed to be desirable. In the first place, the
observations of temperature and wind currents at the summit of
this great mountain would have an important bearing on the
movements of the upper air, a meteorological problem as yet but
imperfectly understood. From a geological point of view the
mountain ought to reveal some interesting facts, and apart from
scientific considerations, the ascent of a mountain over 13,000
ft. in height, situated so far south, would be a matter of
pleasurable excitement both to those who were selected as
climbers and to the rest of us who wished for our companions'
success. After consideration I decided that Professor David,
Mawson and Mackay should constitute the party that was to try to
reach the summit, and they were to be provisioned for ten days. A
supporting-party, consisting of Adams, Marshall and Brocklehurst,
was to assist the main party as far as feasible. The whole
expedition was to be under Adams' charge until he decided that it
was time for his party to return, and the Professor was then to
be in charge of the advance-party. In my written instructions to
Adams, he was given the option of going on to the summit if he
thought it feasible for his party to push on, and he actually did
so, though the supporting-party was not so well equipped for the
mountain work as the advance-party, and was provisioned for six
days only. Instructions were given that the supporting-party was
not to hamper the main party, especially as regarded the division
of provisions, but, as a matter of fact, instead of hampering,
the three men became of great assistance to the advance division,
and lived entirely on their own stores and equipment during the
whole trip. No sooner was it decided to make the ascent, which
was arranged for, finally, on March 4, than the winter quarters
became busy with the bustle of preparation. There were crampons
to be made, food-bags to be prepared and filled, sleeping-bags to
be overhauled, ice-axes to be got out and a hundred and one
things to be seen to; yet such was the energy thrown into this
work that the men were ready for the road and made a start at
8.30 a.m. on the 5th.</p>

<br>
<small>51. SKUA GULLS FEEDING NEAR THE HUT</small></p>
<p>In a previous chapter I have described the nature and extent
of equipment necessary for a sledging trip, so that it is not
necessary now to go into details regarding the preparations for
this particular journey, the only variation from the usual
standard arrangement being in the matter of quantity of food. In
the ascent of a mountain such as Erebus it was obvious that a
limit would soon be reached beyond which it would be impossible
to use a sledge. To meet these circumstances the advance-party
had made an arrangement of straps by which their single
sleeping-bags could be slung in the form of a knapsack upon their
backs, and inside the bags the remainder of their equipment could
be packed. The men of the supporting-party, in case they should
journey beyond ice over which they could drag the sledge, had
made the same preparations for transferring their load to their
shoulders. When they started I must confess that I saw but little
prospect of the whole party reaching the top, yet when, from the
hut, on the third day out, we saw through Armytage's powerful
telescope six tiny black spots slowly crawling up the immense
deep snowfield to the base of the rugged rocky spurs that
descended to the edge of the field, and when I saw next day out
on the skyline the same small figures, I realised that the
supporting-party were going the whole way. On the return of this
expedition Adams and the Professor made a full report, with the
help of which I will follow the progress of the party, the
members of which were winning their spurs not only on their first
Antarctic campaign, but in their first attempt at serious
mountaineering.</p>

<br>
<small>52. MOUNT EREBUS AS SEEN FROM THE WINTER QUARTERS, THE OLD
CRATER ON THE LEFT, AND THE ACTIVE CONE RISING ON THE
RIGHT</small></p>
<p>Mount Erebus bears a name that has loomed large in the history
of polar exploration both north and south. Sir James Clark Ross,
on January 28, 1841, named the great volcano at whose base our
winter quarters were placed after the leading ship of his
expedition. The final fate of that ship is linked with the fate
of Sir John Franklin and one of the most tragic stories of Arctic
exploration, but though both the Erebus and Terror have sunk far
from the scenes of their first exploration, that brilliant period
of Antarctic discovery will ever be remembered by the mountains
which took their names from those stout ships. Standing as a
sentinel at the gate of the Great Ice Barrier, Erebus forms a
magnificent picture. The great mountain rises from sea-level to
an altitude of over 13,000 ft., looking out across the Barrier,
with its enormous snow-clad bulk towering above the white slopes
that run up from the coast. At the top of the mountain an immense
depression marks the site of the old crater, and from the side of
this rises the active cone, generally marked by steam or smoke.
The ascent of such a mountain would be a matter of difficulty in
any part of the world, hardly to be attempted without experienced
guides, but the difficulties were accentuated by the latitude of
Erebus, and the party started off with the full expectation of
encountering very low temperatures. The men all recognised,
however, the scientific value of the achievement at which they
were aiming, and they were determined to do their utmost to reach
the crater itself. How they fared and what they found will be
told best by extracts from the report which was made to me.</p>
<p>Erebus, as seen from our winter quarters, showed distinctly
the traces of the three craters observed from a distance by the
scientific staff of the <i>Discovery</i> expedition. From
sea-level up to an altitude of about 5500 ft. the lower slopes
ascend in a gentle but gradually steepening curve to the base of
the first crater; they are largely covered with snow and glacier
ice down to the shore, where the ice either breaks off to form a
cliff or, as at Glacier Tongue, spreads out seawards in the form
of a narrow blue pier about five miles in length. Near Cape
Royds, however, there are long smooth ridges of brown glacial
gravels and moraines, mostly bare of snow. These are interspersed
with masses of black volcanic rock, and extend to an altitude of
about 1000 ft. Above this and up to about 5000 ft. above the sea,
all is snow and ice, except for an occasional outcrop of dark
lava or a black parasitic cone sharply silhouetted against the
light background of snow or sky. At a level of about 6000 ft. and
just north of the second or main crater, rises a huge black fang
of rock, the relic of the oldest and lowest crater. Immediately
south of this the principal cone sweeps upwards in that graceful
double curve, concave below, convex above, so characteristic of
volcanoes. Rugged buttresses of dark volcanic rock, with steep
snow slopes between, jut out at intervals and support the rim of
this second crater, which reaches an altitude of fully 11,400 ft.
From the north edge of this crater the ground ascends, at first
gradually, then somewhat abruptly, to the third crater, further
south. It is above this last crater that there continually floats
a huge steam cloud. At the time of Ross' expedition this cloud
was reddened with the glow of molten lava, and lava streams
descending from the crater are also described. On the
<i>Discovery</i> expedition we saw a glow once or twice during
the winter months, but we were then situated about twenty-eight
miles from the summit, so that possibly there were at times faint
glows which we did not see, and, besides, it was necessary to go
two or three hundred yards from the ship before the mountain,
which was hidden by the local foothills, appeared in view. In our
winter quarters on the present occasion we had a far better
opportunity for observing the summit of the volcano, for we were
only about fifteen miles off and from our point of view the slope
of the mountain was more gentle towards the summit. Immediately
we stepped outside the door of the hut we were in full view of
the greater part of the mountain. The observer taking the
meteorological observations every two hours had the mountain in
sight, and as Erebus was our high-level meteorological
observatory, to the crown of which we always looked for
indications of wind currents at that elevation, we naturally saw
every phase of activity produced by the fires within. It was for
this reason, no doubt, that during the period of our stay in
these regions, more especially through the winter months, we were
able to record a fairly constant condition of activity on the
mountain. It became quite an ordinary thing to hear reports from
men who had been outside during the winter that there was a
"strong glow on Erebus". These glows at times were much more
vivid than at others. On one particular occasion, when the
barometer showed a period of extreme depression, the glow was
much more active, waxing and waning at intervals of a quarter of
an hour through the night, and at other times we have seen great
bursts of flame crowning the crater.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-pic053"></a><img alt=""
src="1202361h-images/hs-pic053.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>53. THE PARTY WHICH ASCENDED MOUNT EREBUS LEAVING THE
HUT</small></p>
<p>The huge steam column that rises from the crater into the cold
air shot up at times to a height of 3000 or 4000 ft. before
spreading out and receiving its line direction from the air
currents at that particular hour holding the upper atmosphere.
There were occasions when the view of this steam cloud became
much more vivid, and we found that the best view that could be
obtained was when the moon, rising in the eastern sky, passed
behind the summit of the mountain. Then, projected on the disc of
the moon, we could see the great cloud travelling upwards, not
quietly, but impelled by force from below. There were times also
when it was obvious that the molten lava in the crater could not
have been very far from the lip of the cup, for we could see the
deep-red glow reflected strongly on the steam cloud. We often
speculated as to the course of the lava stream would take and its
probable effect on the great glaciers and snowfields flanking the
sides of the mountain, should it ever overflow. These sudden
uprushes were obviously the result of a vast steam explosion in
the interior of the volcano and were sufficient proofs that
Erebus still possesses considerable activity.</p>
<p>On March 5, after the busy day and night of preparation, the
start was made. Breakfast was served at 6 a.m., and one of the
eleven-foot sledges was packed and lashed, the total weight of
the load and sledge being 560 lb. I took a photograph of the
party as they started off. They got under way from the hut at a
quarter to nine, all hands accompanying them across the rocky
ridge at the back of the hut, lifting the sledge and load bodily
over this, and then helping the party to pull along the slopes of
Back Door Bay across Blue Lake up the eastern slope to the first
level. There we said farewell to the mountain party. They first
steered straight up a snow slope and skirted closely some rocky
ridges and moraines in order to avoid crevassed glaciers. About a
mile out and four hundred feet above sea-level a glacial moraine
barred their path, and they had to portage the sledge over it by
slipping ice-axes under the load between the runners and bearers
of the sledge and lifting it over the obstruction. On the further
side of the moraine was a sloping surface of ice and n&eacute;v&eacute; on
which the sledge capsized for the first time. Light snow was
falling, and there was a slight wind. The report supplied to me
by Professor David and Adams depicts in a graphic manner these
first experiences of this party in sledging.</p>

<br>
<small>55. THE PARTY PORTAGING THE SLEDGE OVER A PATCH OF BARE
ROCK</small></p>
<p>Pulling the sledge proved fairly heavy work in places; at one
spot, on the steep slope of a small glacier, the party had a hard
struggle, mostly on their hands and knees, in their efforts to
drag the sledge up the surface of smooth blue ice thinly coated
with loose snow. This difficulty surmounted, they encountered
some sastrugi, which impeded their progress somewhat. "Sastrugi"
means wind furrow, and is the name given to those annoying
obstacles to sledging, due to the action of the wind on the snow.
A blizzard has the effect of scooping out hollows in the snow,
and this is especially the case when local currents are set up
owing to some rock or point of land intercepting the free run of
the wind. These sastrugi vary in depth from two or three inches
to three or four feet, according to the position of any rock
masses that may be near and to the force of the wind forming
them. The raised masses of snow between the hollows are difficult
to negotiate with a sledge, especially when they run more or less
parallel to the course of the traveller. Though they have many
disadvantages, still there are times when their presence is
welcome; especially is this the case when the sky is overcast and
the low stratus cloud obliterates all landmarks. At these times a
dull grey light is over everything, and it is impossible to see
the way to steer unless one takes the line of sastrugi and notes
the angle it makes with the compass course, the compass for the
moment being placed on the snow to obtain the direction. In this
way one can steer a fairly accurate course, occasionally
verifying it by calling a halt and laying off the course again
with the compass, a precaution that is very necessary, for at
times the sastrugi alter in direction.</p>
<p>The sledgers, at this particular juncture, had much trouble in
keeping their feet, and the usual equanimity of some of the men
was disturbed, their remarks upon the subject of sastrugi being
audible above the soft pad of the finnesko, the scrunch of the
ski boots, and the gentle sawing sound of the sledge-runners on
the soft snow. About 6 p.m. the party camped at a small nunatak
of black rock, about 2750 ft. above sea-level and a distance of
seven miles from winter quarters. After a good hot dinner they
turned into their sleeping-bags in the tents and were soon sound
asleep. The following morning, when the men got up for breakfast,
the temperature was 10&deg; below zero Fahr., whilst at our winter
quarters at the same time it was zero. They found, on starting,
that the gradient was becoming much steeper, being 1 in 5, and
sastrugi, running obliquely to their course, caused the sledge to
capsize frequently. The temperature was 8&deg; below zero Fahr., but
the pulling was heavy work and kept the travellers warm. They
camped that night, March 6, at an altitude of 5630 ft., having
travelled only three miles during the whole day, but they had
ascended over 2800 ft. above their previous camp. The temperature
that night was 28&deg; below zero Fahr. The second camp was in a line
with the oldest crater of Erebus, and from the nature of the
volcanic fragments lying around, the Professor was of the opinion
that Erebus had been producing a little lava within its crater
quite recently.</p>

<br>
<small>56. THE CAMP 7000 FEET UP MOUNT EREBUS. THE STEAM FROM THE
ACTIVE CRATER CAN BE SEEN</small></p>
<p>On the following morning Adams decided that the
supporting-party should make the attempt with the forward-party
to reach the summit. I had left the decision in this matter to
his discretion, but I myself had not considered there would be
much chance of the three men of the supporting-party gaining the
summit, and had not arranged their equipment with that object in
view. They were thus handicapped by having a three-man
sleeping-bag, which bulky article one man had to carry; they also
were not so well equipped for carrying packs, bits of rope having
to act as substitutes for the broad straps provided for the
original advance-party. The supporting-party had no crampons, and
so found it more difficult, in places, to get a grip with their
feet on the slippery surface of the snow slopes. However, the
Professor, who had put bars of leather on his ski boots, found
that these answered as well as crampons, and lent the latter to
Marshall. Both Adams and the Professor wore ski boots during the
whole of the ascent. Ski could not be used for such rough
climbing, and had not been taken. All the men were equipped with
both finnesko and ski boots and with the necessaries for camping,
and individual tastes had been given some latitude in the matter
of the clothing worn and carried.</p>
<p>The six men made a depot of the sledge, some of the provisions
and part of the cooking utensils at the second camp, and then
resumed the climb again. They started off with tent poles amongst
other equipment, but after going for half a mile they realised it
would be impossible to climb the mountain with these articles,
which were taken back to the depot. Each man carried a weight of
about 40 lb., the party's gear consisting chiefly of
sleeping-bags, two tents, cooking apparatus, and provisions for
three days. The snow slopes became steeper, and at one time
Mackay, who was cutting steps on the hard snow with his ice-axe,
slipped and glissaded with his load for about a hundred feet, but
his further downward career was checked by a projecting ledge of
snow, and he was soon up again. On the third evening, March 7,
the party camped about 8750 ft. above sea-level, the temperature
at that time being 20&deg; below zero Fahr.</p>
<p>Between 9 and 10 p.m. that night a strong wind sprang up, and
when the men awoke the following morning they found a fierce
blizzard blowing from the south-east. It increased in fury as the
day wore on, and swept with terrific force down the rocky ravine
where they were camped. The whirling snow was so dense and the
roaring wind so loud that, although the two sections were only
about ten yards apart, they could neither see nor hear each
other. Being without tent poles, the tents were just doubled over
the top ends of the sleeping-bags so as to protect the openings
from the drifting snow, but, in spite of this precaution, a great
deal of snow found its way into the bags. In the afternoon
Brocklehurst emerged from the three-man sleeping-bag, and
instantly a fierce gust whirled away one of his wolfskin mits; he
dashed after it, and the force of the wind swept him some way
down the ravine. Adams, who had left the bag at the same time as
Brocklehurst, saw the latter vanish suddenly, and in endeavouring
to return to the bag to fetch Marshall to assist in finding
Brocklehurst he also was blown down by the wind. Meanwhile,
Marshall, the only remaining occupant of the bag, had much ado to
keep himself from being blown, sleeping-bag and all, down the
ravine. Adams had just succeeded in reaching the sleeping-bag on
his hands and knees when Brocklehurst appeared, also on his hands
and knees, having, by desperate efforts, pulled himself back over
the rocks. It was a close call, for he was all but completely
gone, so biting was the cold, before he reached the haven of the
sleeping-bag. He and Adams crawled in, and then, as the bag had
been much twisted up and drifted with snow while Marshall had
been holding it down, Adams and Marshall got out to try and
straighten it out. The attempt was not very successful, as they
were numb with cold and the bag, with only one person inside,
blew about, so they got into it again. Shortly afterwards Adams
made another attempt, and whilst he was working at it the wind
got inside the bag, blowing it open right way up. Adams promptly
got in again, and the adventure thus ended satisfactorily. The
men could do nothing now but lie low whilst the blizzard lasted.
At times they munched a plasmon biscuit or some chocolate. They
had nothing to drink all that day, March 8, and during the
following night, as it would have been impossible to have kept a
lamp alight to thaw out the snow. They got some sleep during the
night in spite of the storm. On awaking at 4 a.m. the following
day, the travellers found that the blizzard was over, so, after
breakfast, they started away again at about 5.30 a.m.</p>

<small>57. BROCKLEHURST LOOKING DOWN FROM A POINT 9000 FEET UP
MOUNT EREBUS. THE CLOUDS LIE BELOW, AND CAPE ROYDS CAN BE
SEEN</small></p>
<p>The angle of ascent was now steeper than ever, being
thirty-four degrees, that is, a rise of 1 in 1&frac12;. As the hard snow
slopes were much too steep to climb without cutting steps with an
ice-axe, they kept as much as possible to the bare rocks.
Occasionally the ar&ecirc;te would terminate upwards in a large snow
slope, and when this was the case they cut steps across the slope
to any other bare rocks which seemed to persist for some distance
in an upward direction. Brocklehurst, who was wearing ski boots
began to feel the cold attacking his feet, but did not think it
was serious enough to change into finnesko. At noon they found a
fair camping ground, and made some tea. They were, at this time,
some 800 ft. below the rim of the old crater and were feeling the
effects of the high altitude and the extreme cold. Below them was
a magnificent panorama of clouds, coast and Barrier snow, but
they could not afford to spend much time admiring it. After a
hasty meal they tackled the ascent again. When they were a little
distance from the top of the rim of the main crater, Mackay
elected to work his way alone with his ice-axe up a long and very
steep n&eacute;v&eacute; slope instead of following the less difficult and
safer route by the rocks where the rest of the party were
proceeding. He passed out of sight, and then the others heard him
call out that he was getting weak and did not think he could
carry on much longer. They made haste to the top of the ridge,
and Marshall and the Professor dropped to the point where he
would be likely to be. Happily, they found him coming toward
them, and Marshall took his load, for he looked very done up. It
appeared that Mackay had found the work of cutting steps with his
heavy load more difficult than he had anticipated, and he only
just managed to reach safety when he fell and fainted. No doubt
this was due, in part, to mountain sickness, which, under the
severe conditions and at the high altitude the party had
attained, also affected Brocklehurst.</p>

<br>
<small>58. THE OLD CRATER OF EREBUS, WITH AN OLDER CRATER IN THE
BACKGROUND. ALTITUDE 11,000 FEET. THE ACTIVE CONE IS HIGHER
STILL</small></p>
<p>Having found a camping place, they dropped their loads, and
the members of the party were at leisure to observe the nature of
their surroundings. They had imagined an even plain of n&eacute;v&eacute; or
glacier ice filling the extinct crater to the brim and sloping up
gradually to the active cone at its southern end, but instead of
this they found themselves on the very brink of a precipice of
black rock, forming the inner edge of the old crater. This wall
of dark lava was mostly vertical, while, in some places, it
overhung, and was from eighty to a hundred feet in height. The
base of the cliff was separated from the snow plain beyond by a
deep ditch like a huge dry moat, which was evidently due to the
action of blizzards. These winds, striking fiercely from the
south-east against the great inner wall of the old crater, had
given rise to a powerful back eddy at the edge of the cliff, and
it was this eddy which had scooped out the deep trench in the
hard snow. The trench was from thirty to forty feet deep, and was
bounded by more or less vertical sides. Around our winter
quarters any isolated rock or cliff face that faced the
south-east blizzard wind exhibited a similar phenomenon, though,
of course, on a much smaller scale. Beyond the wall and trench
was an extensive snowfield with the active cone and crater at its
southern end, the latter emitting great volumes of steam, but
what surprised the travellers most were the extraordinary
structures which rose here and there above the surface of the
snowfield. They were in the form of mounds and pinnacles of the
most varied and fantastic appearance. Some resembled beehives,
others were like huge ventilating cowls, others like isolated
turrets, and others again in shape resembled various animals. The
men were unable at first sight to understand the origin of these
remarkable structures, and as it was time for food, they left the
closer investigation for later in the day.</p>
<p>As they walked along the rampart of the old crater wall to
find a camping ground, their figures were thrown up against the
skyline, and down at our winter quarters they were seen by us,
having been sighted by Armytage with his telescope. He had
followed the party for the first two days with the glasses, but
they were lost to view when they began to work through the rocky
ground, and it was just on the crater edge that they were picked
up by the telescope again.</p>
<p>The camp chosen for the meal was in a little rocky gully on
the north-west slope of the main cone, and about fifty feet below
the rim of the old crater. Whilst some cooked the meal, Marshall
examined Brocklehurst's feet, as the latter stated that for some
time past he had lost all feeling in them. When his ski boots and
socks had been taken off, it was found that both his big toes
were black, and that four more toes, though less severely
affected, were also frost-bitten. From their appearance it was
evident that some hours must have elapsed since this had
occurred. Marshall and Mackay set at work at once to restore
circulation in the feet by warming and chafing them. Their
efforts were, under the circumstances, fairly successful, but it
was clear that ultimate recovery from so severe a frostbite would
be both slow and tedious. Brocklehurst's feet, having been
thoroughly warmed, were put into dry socks and finnesko stuffed
with sennegrass, and then all hands went to lunch at 3.30 p.m. It
must have required great pluck and determination on his part to
have climbed almost continuously for nine hours up the steep and
difficult track they had followed with his feet so badly
frost-bitten. After lunch Brocklehurst was left safely tucked up
in the three-man sleeping-bag, and the remaining five members of
the party started off to explore the floor of the old crater.
Ascending to the crater rim, they climbed along it until they
came to a spot where there was a practicable breach in the crater
wall and where a narrow tongue of snow bridged the n&eacute;v&eacute; trench at
its base.</p>

<br>
<small>59. A REMARKABLE FUMAROLE IN THE OLD CRATER, IN THE FORM
OF A COUCHANT LION. THE MEN (FROM THE LEFT) ARE: MACKAY, DAVID,
ADAMS, MARSHALL</small></p>
<p>They all roped up directly they arrived on the hard snow in
the crater and advanced cautiously over the snow plain, keeping a
sharp lookout for crevasses. They steered for some of the
remarkable mounds already mentioned, and when the nearest was
reached and examined, they noticed some curious hollows, like
partly roofed-in drains, running towards the mound. Pushing on
slowly, they reached eventually a small parasitic cone, about
1000 ft. above the level of their camp and over a mile distant
from it. Sticking out from under the snow were lumps of lava,
large felspar crystals, from one to three inches in length, and
fragments of pumice; both felspar and pumice were in many cases
coated with sulphur. Having made as complete an examination as
time permitted, they started to return to camp, no longer roped
together, as they had not met any definite crevasses on their way
out. They directed their steps towards one of the ice mounds,
which bore a whimsical resemblance to a lion couch ant, and from
which smoke appeared to be issuing. To the Professor the origin
of these peculiar structures was now no longer a mystery, for he
recognised that they were the outward and visible signs of
fumaroles. In ordinary climates, a fumarole, or volcanic
vapour-well, may be detected by the thin cloud of steam above it,
and usually one can at once feel the warmth by passing one's hand
into the vapour column, but in the rigour of the Antarctic
climate the fumaroles of Erebus have their vapour turned into ice
as soon as it reaches the surface of the snow plain. Thus ice
mounds, somewhat similar in shape to the sinter mounds formed by
the geysers of New Zealand, of Iceland and of Yellowstone Park,
are built up round the orifices of the fumaroles of Erebus.
Whilst exploring one of these fumaroles, Mackay fell suddenly up
to his thighs into one of its concealed conduits, and only saved
himself from falling in deeper still by means of his ice-axe.
Marshall had a similar experience at about the same time.</p>
<p>The party arrived at camp shortly after 6 p.m., and found
Brocklehurst progressing as well as could be expected. They sat
on the rocks after tea admiring the glorious view to the west.
Below them was a vast rolling sea of cumulus cloud, and far away
the western mountains glowed in the setting sun. Next morning,
when they got up at 4 a.m., they had a splendid view of the
shadow of Erebus projected on the field of cumulus cloud below
them by the rising sun. Every detail of the profile of the
mountain as outlined on the clouds could be readily recognised.
After breakfast, while Marshall was attending to Brocklehurst's
feet, the hypsometer, which had become frozen on the way up, was
thawed out and a determination of the boiling-point made. This,
when reduced and combined with the mean of the aneroid levels,
made the altitude of the old crater rim, just above the camp,
11,400 ft. At 6 a.m. the party left the camp and made all speed
to reach the summit of the present crater. On their way across
the old crater, Mawson photographed the fumarole that resembled
the lion and also took a view of the active crater about one and
a half miles distant, though there was considerable difficulty in
taking photographs owing to the focal plane shutter having become
jammed by frost. Near the furthest point reached by the
travellers on the preceding afternoon they observed several
patches of yellow ice and found on examination that the colour
was due to sulphur. They next ascended several rather steep
slopes formed of alternating beds of hard snow and vast
quantities of large and perfect felspar crystals, mixed with
pumice. A little further on they reached the base of the
volcano's active cone. Their progress now was painfully slow, as
the altitude and cold combined to make respiration difficult. The
cone of Erebus is built up chiefly of blocks of pumice, from a
few inches to a few feet in diameter. Externally these were grey
or often yellow owing to incrustations of sulphur, but when
broken they were of a resinous brown colour. At last, a little
after 10 a.m., on March 10, the edge of the active crater was
reached, and the little party stood on the summit of Erebus, the
first men to conquer perhaps the most remarkable summit in the
world. They had travelled about two and a half miles from the
last camp, and had ascended just 2000 ft., and this journey had
taken them over four hours. The report describes most vividly the
magnificent and awe-inspiring scene before them.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-pic060"></a><img alt=""
src="1202361h-images/hs-pic060.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>60. ONE THOUSAND FEET BELOW THE ACTIVE CONE</small></p>
<p>"We stood on the verge of a vast abyss, and at first could see
neither to the bottom nor across it on account of the huge mass
of steam filling the crater and soaring aloft in a column 500 to
1000 ft. high. After a continuous loud hissing sound, lasting for
some minutes, there would come from below a big dull boom, and
immediately great globular masses of steam would rush upwards to
swell the volume of the snow-white cloud which ever sways over
the crater. This phenomenon recurred at intervals during the
whole of our stay at the crater. Meanwhile, the air around us was
extremely redolent of burning sulphur. Presently a pleasant
northerly breeze fanned away the steam cloud, and at once the
whole crater stood revealed to us in all its vast extent and
depth. Mawson's angular measurement made the depth 900 ft. and
the greatest width about half a mile. There were at least three
well-defined openings at the bottom of the cauldron, and it was
from these that the steam explosions proceeded. Near the
south-west portion of the crater there was an immense rift in the
rim, perhaps 300 to 400 ft. deep. The crater wall opposite the
one at the top of which we were standing presented features of
special interest. Beds of dark pumiceous lava or pumice
alternated with white zones of snow. There was no direct evidence
that the snow was bedded with the lava, though it was possible
that such may have been the case. From the top of one of the
thickest of the lava or pumice beds, just where it touched the
belt of snow, there rose scores of small steam jets all in a row.
They were too numerous and too close together to have been each
an independent fumarole; the appearance was rather suggestive of
the snow being converted into steam by the heat of the layer of
rock immediately below it."</p>
<p>While at the crater's edge the party made a boiling-point
determination by the hypsometer, but the result was not so
satisfactory as that made earlier in the morning at the camp. As
the result of averaging aneroid levels, together with the
hypsometer determination at the top of the old crater, Erebus may
be calculated to rise to a height of 13,370 ft. above sea-level.
As soon as the measurements had been made and some photographs
had been taken by Mawson, the party returned to the camp, as it
had been decided to descend to the base of the main cone that
day, a drop of 8000 ft.</p>

<br>
<small>61. THE CRATER OF EREBUS, 900 FEET DEEP AND HALF A MILE
WIDE. STEAM IS SEEN RISING ON THE LEFT. THE PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN
FROM THE LOWER PART OF THE CRATER EDGE</small></p>
<p>On the way back a traverse was made of the main crater and
levels taken for constructing a geological section. Numerous
specimens of the unique felspar crystals and of the pumice and
sulphur were collected. On arriving in camp the travellers made a
hasty meal, packed up, shouldered their burdens once more and
started down the steep mountain slope. Brocklehurst insisted on
carrying his own heavy load in spite of his frost-bitten feet.
They followed a course a little to the west of the one they took
when ascending. The rock was rubbly and kept slipping under their
feet, so that falls were frequent. After descending a few hundred
feet they found that the rubbly spur of rock down which they were
floundering ended abruptly in a long and steep n&eacute;v&eacute; slope. Three
courses were now open to them: they could retrace their steps to
the point above them where the rocky spur had deviated from the
main ar&ecirc;te; cut steps across the n&eacute;v&eacute; slope; or glissade down
some five or six hundred feet to a rocky ledge below. In their
tired state preference was given to the path of least resistance,
which was offered by the glissade, and they therefore rearranged
their loads so that they would roll down easily. They were now
very thirsty, but they found that if they gathered a little snow,
squeezed it into a ball and placed it on the surface of a piece
of rock, it melted at once almost on account of the heat of the
sun and thus they obtained a makeshift drink. They launched their
loads down the slope and watched them as they bumped and bounded
over the wavy ridges of neve. Brocklehurst's load, which
contained the cooking utensils, made the noisiest descent, and
the aluminium cookers were much battered when they finally
fetched up against the rocks below. Then the members of the
party, grasping their ice-axes firmly, followed their gear. As
they gathered speed on the downward course and the chisel-edge of
the ice-axe bit deeper into the hard neve, their necks and faces
were sprayed with a shower of ice. All reached the bottom of the
slope safely, and they repeated this glissade down each
succeeding snow slope towards the foot of the main cone. Here and
there they bumped heavily on hard sastrugi and both clothes and
equipment suffered in the rapid descent; unfortunately, also, one
of the aneroids was lost and one of the hypsometer thermometers
broken. At last the slope flattened out to the gently inclined
terrace where the depot lay, and they reached it by walking.
Altogether they had dropped down 5000 ft. between three in the
afternoon and seven in the evening.</p>
<p>Adams and Marshall were the first to reach the depot, the rest
of the party, with the exception of Brocklehurst, having made a
<i>d&eacute;tour</i> to the left in consequence of having to pursue some
lost luggage in that direction. At the depot they found that the
blizzard of the 8th had played havoc with their gear, for the
sledge had been overturned and some of the load scattered to a
distance and covered partly with drift snow. After dumping their
packs, Adams and Marshall went to meet Brocklehurst, for they
noticed that a slight blizzard was springing up. Fortunately, the
wind soon died down, the weather cleared, and the three were able
to regain the camp. Tea was got ready, and the remainder of the
party arrived about 10 p.m. They camped that night at the depot
and at 3 a.m. next day got up to breakfast. After breakfast a
hunt was made for some articles that were still missing, and then
the sledge was packed and the march homewards commenced at 5.30
a.m. They now found that the sastrugi caused by the late blizzard
were very troublesome, as the ridges were from four to five feet
above the hollows and lay at an oblique angle to the course. Rope
brakes were put on the sledge-runners, and two men went in front
to pull when necessary, while two steadied the sledge, and two
were stationed behind to pull back when required. It was more
than trying to carry on at this juncture, for the sledge either
refused to move or suddenly it took charge and overran those who
were dragging it, and capsizes occurred every few minutes. Owing
to the slippery nature of the ground, some members of the party
who had not crampons or barred ski boots were badly shaken up,
for they sustained numerous sudden falls. One has to experience a
surface like this to realise how severe a jar a fall entails. The
only civilised experience that is akin to it is when one steps
unknowingly on a slide which some small street boy has made on
the pavement. Marshall devised the best means of assisting the
progress of the sledge. When it took charge he jumped on behind
and steered it with his legs as it bumped and jolted over the
sastrugi, but he found sometimes that his thirteen-stone weight
did not prevent him from being bucked right over the sledge and
flung on the n&eacute;v&eacute; on the other side.</p>

<br>
<small>62. ANOTHER VIEW OF THE CRATER OF EREBUS</small></p>
<p>They reached the nunatak where they had made their first camp
on the way up, six miles distant from Cape Royds, at about 7.30
a.m. By this time there was every symptom of the approach of a
blizzard, and the snow was beginning to drift before a gusty
south-easterly wind. This threatened soon to cut them off from
all view of the winter quarters. They were beginning to feel very
tired, one of the tents had a large hole burnt in it, the oil
supply was almost done, and one of the primus stoves had been put
out of action as the result of the glissade; so, in the
circumstances, they decided to make a dash for Cape Royds,
leaving their sledge and equipment to be picked up later. In the
grey uncertain light the sastrugi did not show up in relief, and
every few feet some member of the party stumbled and fell,
sprawling over the snow. At last their eyes were gladdened by the
shining surface of the Blue Lake only half a mile distant from
winter quarters. Now that the haven was at hand, and the stress
and strain over, their legs grew heavy and leaden, and that last
half-mile seemed one of the hardest they had covered. It was
fortunate that the weather did not become worse.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at winter quarters, we had been very busy opening
cases and getting things shipshape outside, with the result that
the cubicles of the absentees were more or less filled with a
general accumulation of stores. When Armytage reported that he
saw the party on their way down the day before they arrived at
the hut, we decided to make the cubicles tidy for the travellers.
We had just begun on the Professor's cubicle when, about 11 a.m.,
I left the hut for a moment and was astonished to see within
thirty yards of me, coming over the brow of the ridge by the hut,
six slowly moving figures. I ran towards them shouting: "Did you
get to the top?" There was no answer, and I asked again. Adams
pointed with his hand upwards, but this did not satisfy me, so I
repeated my question. Then Adams said: "Yes", and I ran back to
the hut and shouted to the others, who all came streaming out to
cheer the successful venturers. We shook hands all round and
opened some champagne, which tasted like nectar to the wayworn
people. Marshall prescribed a dose to us stay-at-home ones, so
that we might be able to listen quietly to the tale the party had
to tell.</p>
<p>Except to Joyce, Wild and myself, who had seen similar things
on the former expedition, the eating and drinking capacity of the
returned party was a matter of astonishment. In a few minutes
Roberts had produced a great saucepan of Quaker oats and milk,
the contents of which disappeared in a moment, to be followed by
the greater part of a fresh-cut ham and homemade bread, with New
Zealand fresh butter. The six had evidently found on the slopes
of Erebus six fully developed, polar sledging appetites. The meal
at last ended, came more talk, smokes and then bed for the weary
travellers.</p>

<small>64. THE HUT IN THE EARLY WINTER</small></p>
<p>After some days' delay on account of unfavourable weather, a
party consisting of Adams, the Professor, Armytage, Joyce, Wild
and Marshall, equipped with a seven-foot sledge, tent and
provisions, as a precaution against possible bad weather, started
out to fetch in the eleven-foot sledge with the explorers'
equipment. After a heavy pull over the soft, new-fallen snow, in
cloudy weather, with the temperature at midday 20&deg; below zero
Fahr., and with a stiff wind blowing from the south-east, they
sighted the nunatak, recovered the abandoned sledge and placing
the smaller one on top, pulled them both back as far as Blue
Lake. I went out to meet the party, and we left the sledge at
Blue Lake until the following day, when two of the Manchurian
ponies were harnessed to the sledges and the gear was brought
into winter quarters.</p>

<h3>RESULTS OF THE EREBUS JOURNEY</h3>
<p><b>IN</b> closing the report the Professor and Adams mention
the impression made upon them by the scenes that unfolded
themselves during the journey. "The glorious sunsets, the magic
of the sunrise seen from our camp above the clouds when the great
shadow of Erebus swept across McMurdo Sound, and touched the
far-off western mountains; the weird shapes of the green and
white ice mounds built around the fumaroles of the old crater,
with its pavement of sparkling crystals interspersed with snow
and pumice; the hissing and booming cauldron of the modern crater
with its long line of steam jets and its snow-white pillow of
steam, are all memories that will never fade from our minds."</p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-pic065"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>65. A STEAM EXPLOSION ON MOUNT BIRD</small></p>
<p>It must be said that, considering the time of year, the party
were extremely fortunate in the weather encountered on their
journey. In the first place the route followed proved
satisfactory, for while it gave a good snow surface for the
sledge it kept the party entirely free from any dangerously
crevassed ice. Next, the blizzard, though very trying while it
lasted on account of its violence and low temperature, commencing
at 30&deg; below zero Fahr., really proved a blessing in disguise,
for it lasted just long enough to raise the temperature
considerably, as well as to check the high-level south-westerly
wind, and so produce a calm. Naturally I was much pleased to have
all our party back after so fine a piece of work and without any
serious accident, though, indeed, Brocklehurst's foot did not
look at all promising, for two of the toes on the right foot were
very much swollen and discoloured, whilst the big toe remained
black, and Marshall was of the opinion that part would have to be
amputated later. Except for this accident every one was in the
best of health. I asked the Professor to give me a short summary
of the scientific results of the ascent, and I think they will
not be out of place in this narrative, for the object of the
ascent was mainly to gather scientific information, though, of
course, there was a strong desire to reach the summit of a
hitherto unclimbed mountain, of great height and unknown
nature.</p>
<p>"Among the scientific results", wrote Professor David, "may be
mentioned in the first place the calculation of the height of the
mountain. Sir James Clark Ross, in 1841, estimated the height to
be 12,367 ft. The National Antarctic Expedition of 1901
determined its height at first to be 13,120 ft., but this was
subsequently altered to 12,922 ft., the height now given on the
Admiralty chart of the region. Our observations for altitude were
made partly with aneroids and partly with a hypsometer. All the
aneroid levels and hypsometer observations have been calculated
by means of simultaneous readings of the barometer taken at our
winter quarters. Cape Royds. These observations show that the rim
of the second or main crater of Erebus is about 11,350 ft. above
sea-level, and that the height of the summit of the active crater
is about 13,350 ft. above sea-level. The fact may be emphasised
that in both the methods adopted by us for estimating the
altitude of the mountain, atmospheric pressure was the sole
factor on which we relied. The determination arrived at by the
<i>Discovery</i> expedition was based on measurements made with a
theodolite from sea-level. It is, of course, quite possible that
Ross' original estimate of the height of Erebus may have been
correct, and this active volcano may have gained in height by
about a thousand feet during the sixty-seven years which have
elapsed since the time of his expedition. In the next place among
features of geological interest may be mentioned the fact that
the old moraines left by a former gigantic ancestor of the Great
Ice Barrier, ascend the western slopes of Erebus to a height of
fully 1000 ft. above sea-level. As the adjacent McMurdo Sound is
at least three hundred fathoms deep, this ice sheet when at its
maximum development must have been at least 2800 ft. in
thickness. We noticed that in addition to these old ice barrier
moraines, there were moraines newer than the period of greatest
glaciation. They had evidently been formed by glaciers radiating
from Erebus.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-pic066"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>66. HAULING SEAL MEAT FOB THE WINTER QUARTERS</small></p>
<p>"As regards the geological structure of Erebus, we have
concluded provisionally that there is evidence of the existence
of four superimposed craters. The oldest and lowest and, at the
same time, the largest of these attained an altitude of between
6000 and 7000 ft. above sea-level, and was fully six miles in
diameter. The second rises to a height of 11,350 ft. and has a
diameter of over two miles; its rim is bounded inwards by a
vertical cliff, which no doubt descended originally into a crater
of vast depth. This second crater has now been filled up almost
to the brim, partly with snow, partly with large crystals of
felspar and fragments of pumice, and partly with the numerous
funnel-shaped ice mounds already described. The third crater
rises to a height of fully 12,200 ft. above sea-level, and its
former outline has now been almost obliterated by the material of
the modern active cone and crater. The latter, which rises about
800 ft. above the former, is composed chiefly of fragments of
pumice. These vary in size from an inch or so up to a yard in
diameter. Quantities of felspar crystals are interspersed with
them, and both are incrusted with sulphur. The fumes rising from
the crater at the time of our visit smelt strongly of sulphur,
and this fact, considered in conjunction with the yellow coating
of sulphur round the rim of the active crater, shows that the
volcano is partly in a solfataric stage. At the same time the
frequent glows on the steam cloud above the crater, and at the
actual edge, as seen from our winter quarters during the winter
months, prove that molten lava still wells up into the crater.
The fresh volcanic bombs picked up by us at spots four miles
distant from the crater and lying on the surface of comparatively
new snow are evidence that Erebus has recently been projecting
lava to great heights.</p>

<br>
<small>D9. CRATER OF MOUNT EREBUS AND SECTION</small></p>
<p>"As regards size, as already mentioned, the active crater
measures about half a mile by one-third of a mile in diameter,
and is about 900 ft. in depth. If the active crater of Erebus be
compared with that of Vesuvius it will be found that the former
is about three times as deep as that of the latter. One of the
most striking features observed at the summit was the long row of
steam jets about 300 ft. below the inside rim of the crater.
There were many scores of these developed at the upper surface of
a thick bed of dark lava or pumice, which projected slightly into
the crater. Possibly the horizon of the steam jets represented a
high-water mark, so to speak, of lava within the crater, and the
steam may have been due to the vapourising of snow in contact
with the hot rock; certainly there was a white band of snow above
the zone of dark rock which gave origin to the steam jets, but
whether this snow formed a definite bed intercalated in the
pumice beds or whether it was a superficial layer caught in the
projecting ledge of dark rock is uncertain. It is evident from
the mineralogical character of the recently erupted pumice of the
active crater that Erebus is still producing that rare type of
lava known as kenyte. Two features on the geology of Erebus which
are specially distinctive are the vast quantities of large and
perfect felspar crystals, and the ice fumaroles. The crystals are
from two to three inches in length. Many of them have had their
angles and edges slightly rounded by attrition, through clashing
against one another when they were originally projected from the
funnel of the volcano, but numbers of them are beautifully
perfect. The fluid lava which once surrounded them has been blown
away in the form of fine dust by the force of steam explosions,
and the crystals have been left behind intact.</p>

<br>
<small>67. AN ICE CAVERN IN THE WINTER. PHOTOGRAPHED BY THE LIGHT
OF HURRICANE LAMPS</small></p>
<p>"The ice fumaroles are specially remarkable. About fifty of
these were visible to us on the track which we followed to and
from the crater, and doubtless there were numbers that we did not
see. These unique ice-mounds have resulted from the condensation
of vapour around the orifices of the fumaroles. It is only under
conditions of very low temperature that such structures could
exist. No structures like them are known in any other part of the
world.</p>
<p>"It would be hard to overestimate the scientific importance of
knowledge of the meteorological conditions obtaining at Erebus.
Erebus is the Pisgah of the meteorologist. The details of the
phenomena observed there will, of course, be given in the
meteorological memoirs of this expedition, and they are too bulky
to quote here. Mention, however, may be made of four phenomena
which specially impressed themselves upon us during our ascent of
Erebus. In the first place we noticed that the whole of the
snow-field lying within the rim of the second crater is strongly
ridged with sastrugi, which trend from west by south to east by
north. These sastrugi have a sharp edge directed towards the
west. The latter is the quarter from which the prevalent wind
blows near the summit of Erebus. This is the return current of
air blowing back from the South Pole towards the Equator. Next
our experience on Erebus showed that the south-easterly blizzard
sometimes extends from sea-level up to at least as high as the
top of the second crater, that is, to over 11,000 ft. in height.
Thirdly, it may be noticed that on the day we reached the summit
of Erebus, March 10, we found ourselves, at a level of 13,300
ft., within the lower limit of the upper wind which at that time
was blowing gently from a northerly direction. It may be
remembered that this date was one and a half days after a strong
south-east blizzard. These conditions seem to indicate that after
a blizzard, and probably during its later phases, the great
middle air current normally travelling from near the South Pole
towards the Equator, is temporarily abolished, having become
absorbed into the immense stream of the blizzard.</p>
<p>"Fourthly, it may be recorded that the temperatures taken by
us demonstrate the following fact, obviously of considerable
importance: From sea-level at Cape Royds up to the summit of
Erebus, for the first 6000 ft., the temperature falls at the rate
of about 4&deg; Fahr. per thousand feet, but above the altitude the
fall is much less rapid, being at the rate of less than 1&deg; Fahr.
per thousand feet, and in one case the temperature curve on
Erebus was found to be inverted.</p>

<br>
<small>68. MOUNT EREBUS IN ERUPTION ON JUNE 14, 1908. THE
PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN BY MOONLIGHT</small></p>
<p>"Finally, we had an opportunity, when in our camp on Erebus on
the morning of March 10, of seeing an explanation of the
remarkable phenomena called 'earth shadows' by Captain Scott. On
that occasion we saw that the rising sun projected across McMurdo
Sound a great conical shadow of Erebus, some forty miles wide, on
to the western mountains. If now an observer were to stand
within, or near to the base of this shadow, and looking towards
the apex of it westwards, he would see a conic section like that
of a slightly inverted cone, seen very obliquely. We noticed
subsequently when viewing the earth shadows from our winter
quarters at Cape Royds that the two barbs of the broad arrow of
the earth shadows were not equally inclined to the vertical, but
that their relative angles of slope were directly proportional to
the angles of slope of the north and south side respectively of
Erebus. It is evident, therefore, that these dark barbs are a
shadow projection of the cone of Erebus. The central vertical
dark beam figured by Captain Scott has not yet been definitely
observed by us.</p>
<p>"From the above brief notes it will be obvious that Erebus is
very interesting geologically on account of its unique fumaroles,
its remarkable felspar crystals and rare lavas, as well as on
account of its having served as a gigantic tide gauge to record
the flood level of the greatest recent glaciation of Antarctica,
when the whole of Ross Island was but a nunatak in a gigantic
field of ice. From a meteorological point of view, its situation
between the belt of polar calms and the South Pole; its isolation
from the disturbing influence of large land masses; its great
height, which enables it to penetrate the whole system of
atmospheric circulation, and, above all, the constant steam cloud
at its summit, swinging to and fro like a huge wind vane, combine
to make Erebus one of the most interesting places on earth to the
meteorologist."</p>

<br>
<h3>LIFE AND WORK IN WINTER QUARTERS</h3>
<p><b>AFTER</b> the journey to the summit of Erebus we began to
settle down and prepare for the long winter months that were
rapidly approaching. Already the nights were lengthening and
stars becoming familiar objects in the sky. Our main work was to
secure the hut firmly against possible damage from the south-east
blizzards. After everything had been made safe as far as it lay
in our power, we felt that if anything untoward happened it would
not be our fault, so we turned our attention to the scientific
studies that lay to our hand. As we were only a small party, it
was impossible for all of us to carry on scientific work and, at
the same time, attend to what I might call the household duties.
It was most important for the geologists of the expedition to get
as far afield as practicable before the winter night closed in on
us, so every day both the Professor and Priestley were out early
and late, with their collecting-bags and geological hammers,
finding on every successive trip they made within a radius of
three or four miles of the winter quarters new and interesting
geological specimens, the examination of which would give them
plenty of work in the winter months. Scattered around Cape Royds
were large numbers of granite boulders of every size and colour,
deposited there by the great receding ice-sheet that once filled
McMurdo Sound and covered the lower slopes of Erebus. The
geologists were full of delight that circumstances should have
placed our winter quarters at a spot so fruitful for their
labours. Murray was equally pleased at the prospect of the
biological work which lay before him, for hardly a day passed
without some one bringing in a report of the existence of another
lake or tarn, and soon we realised that around us lay more than a
dozen of these lakelets, which might possibly prove a fruitful
field for biological study. To Mawson the many varied forms of
ice and snow, both in the lakes and on the surrounding hills,
gave promise of encouraging results in that branch of physics in
which he was particularly interested. The lengthening nights also
gave us indications that the mysterious Aurora Australis would
soon be waving its curtains and beams over our winter quarters,
and as information on this phenomenon was greatly needed, Mawson
made preparations for recording the displays.</p>

<br>
<small>69. PROFESSOR DAVID STANDING BY MAWSON'S
ANEMOMETER</small></p>
<p>I have already stated that the meteorological screen had been
set up and observations begun before the Erebus party left. Now
that all hands were back at the hut, a regular system of
recording the observations was arranged. Adams, who was the
meteorologist of the expedition, took all the observations from 8
a.m. to 8 p.m. The night-watchman took them from 10 p.m. to 6
a.m. These observations were taken every two hours, and it may
interest the reader to learn what was done in this way, though I
do not wish to enter here into a lengthy dissertation on
meteorology. The observations on air temperature, wind and
direction of cloud have an important bearing on similar
observations taken in more temperate climes, and in a place like
the Antarctic, where up till now our knowledge has been so
meagre, it was most essential that every bit of information
bearing on meteorological phenomena should be noted. We were in a
peculiarly favourable position for observing not only the changes
that took place in the lower atmosphere but also those which took
place in the higher strata of the atmosphere. Erebus, with steam
and smoke always hanging above it, indicated by the direction
assumed by the cloud what the upper air currents were doing, and
thus we were in touch with an excellent high-level
observatory.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-pic070"></a><img alt=""
src="1202361h-images/hs-pic070.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>70. A CLOUD EFFECT BEFORE THE SEA FROZE OVER</small></p>
<p>The instruments under Adams' care were as complete as
financial considerations had permitted. The meteorological screen
contained a maximum thermometer, that is, a thermometer which
indicates the highest temperature reached during the period
elapsing between two observations. It is so constructed that when
the mercury rises in the tube it remains at its highest point,
though the temperature might fall greatly shortly afterwards.
After reading the recorded height, the thermometer is shaken, and
this operation causes the mercury to drop to the actual
temperature obtaining at the moment of observation; the
thermometer is then put back into the screen and is all ready for
the next reading taken two hours later. A minimum thermometer
registered the lowest temperature that occurred between the
two-hourly readings, but this thermometer was not a mercury one,
as mercury freezes at a temperature of about 39&deg; below zero, and
we therefore used spirit thermometers. When the temperature drops
the surface of the column of spirit draws down a little black
indicator immersed in it, and if the temperature rises and the
spirit advances in consequence, the spirit flows past the
indicator, which remains at the lowest point, and on the
observations being taken its position is read on the graduated
scale. By these instruments we were always able to ascertain what
the highest temperature and what the lowest temperature had been
throughout the two hours during which the observation screen had
not been visited. In addition to the maximum and minimum
thermometers, there were the wet and dry bulb thermometers. The
dry bulb records the actual temperature of the air at the moment,
and we used a spirit thermometer for this purpose. The wet bulb
consisted of an ordinary thermometer, round the bulb of which was
tied a little little piece of muslin that had been dipped in
water and of course froze at once on exposure to the air. The
effect of the evaporation from the ice which covered the bulb was
to cause the temperature recorded to be lower than that recorded
by the dry bulb thermometer in proportion to the amount of water
present in the atmosphere at the time. To ensure accuracy the wet
bulb thermometers were changed every two hours, the thermometer
which was read being brought back to the hut and returned to the
screen later freshly sheathed in ice. It was, of course,
impossible to wet the exposed thermometer with a brush dipped in
water, as is the practice in temperate climates, for water could
not be carried from the hut to the screen without freezing into
solid ice. To check the thermometers there was also kept in the
screen a self-recording thermometer, or thermograph. This is a
delicate instrument fitted with metal discs, which expand or
contract readily with every fluctuation of the temperature.
Attached to these discs is a delicately poised lever carrying a
pen charged with ink, and the point of this pen rests against a
graduated roll of paper fastened to a drum, which is revolved by
clockwork once in every seven days. The pen thus draws a line on
the paper, rising and falling in sympathy with the changes in the
temperature of the air.</p>
<p>All these instruments were contained inside the meteorological
screen, which was so constructed that while there was free access
of air, the wind could not strike through it with any violence,
neither could the sun throw its direct beams on the sensitive
thermometers inside. On the flat top of the screen were nailed
two pieces of wood in the form of a cross, the long axis of which
lay in the true meridian, that is, one end pointing due south,
the other end due north. On a small rod attached to the fore end
of the screen was a vane that floated out in the opposite
direction to that from which the wind was blowing, and by
reference to the vane and the cross the direction of the wind was
ascertained and noted when the other observations were taken. To
record the force of the wind and the number of miles it travelled
between each observation, there was an instrument called an
anemometer, which rested on one of the uprights supporting the
meteorological screen; the type of anemometer used by the
expedition is known as the "Robinson". It consists of four cups
or hemispheres revolving on a pivot which communicates by a
series of cogs with a dial having two hands like the hands of a
watch. The long hand makes one revolution and records five miles,
and the smaller hand records up to five hundred miles. At a
glance we could thus tell the number of miles the wind had blown
during the time elapsing between successive observations. In
ordinary climates the work of reading these instruments was a
matter of little difficulty and only took a few minutes, but in
the Antarctic, especially when a blizzard was blowing, the
difficulty was much increased and the strong wind often blew out
the hurricane lamp which was used to read the instruments in the
darkness. On these occasions the unfortunate observer had to
return to the hut, relight the lamp and again struggle up the
windy ridge to the screen. In order to try and facilitate the
reading of the various instruments during the long polar night
the dry cells from the motor-car were connected with a cable from
the hut to the screen, but the power was not sufficient to give a
satisfactory light.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-pic071"></a><img alt=""
src="1202361h-images/hs-pic071.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>71. MUSIC IN THE HUT</small></p>
<p>In addition to the meteorological screen, there was another
erection built on the top of the highest ridge by Mawson, who
placed there an anemometer of his own construction to register
the strength of the heaviest gusts of wind during a blizzard. We
found that the squalls frequently blew with a force of over a
hundred miles an hour. There remained still one more outdoor
instrument connected with weather observation, that was the snow
gauge. The Professor, by utilising some spare lengths of stove
chimney, erected a snow gauge into which was collected the
falling snow whenever a blizzard blew. The snow was afterwards
taken into the hut in the vessel into which it had been
deposited, and when it was melted down we were able to calculate
fairly accurately the amount of the snowfall. This observation
was an important one, for much depends on the amount of
precipitation in the Antarctic regions. It is on the
precipitation in the form of snow, and on the rate of
evaporation, that calculations regarding the formation of the
huge snow-fields and glaciers depend. We secured our information
regarding the rate of evaporation by suspending measured cubes of
ice and snow from rods projecting at the side of the hut, where
they were free from the influence of the interior warmth. Inside
the hut was kept a standard mercurial barometer, which was also
read every two hours, and in addition to this there was a
barograph which registered the varying pressure of the atmosphere
in a curve for a week at a time. Every Monday morning Adams
changed the paper on both thermograph and barograph, and every
day recorded the observations in the meteorological log. It will
be seen that the meteorologist had plenty to occupy his time, and
generally when the men came in from a walk they had some
information as to the movement of the smoke cloud on Erebus or
the observation of a parhelion or parselene to record. As soon as
the ice was strong enough to bear in the bay, Murray commenced
his operations there. His object was the collection of the
different marine creatures that rest on the bottom of the sea or
creep about there, and he made extensive preparations for their
capture. A hole was dug through the ice, and a trap let down to
the bottom; this trap was baited with a piece of penguin or seal,
and the shellfish, Crustacea and other marine animals found their
way in through the opening in the top, and the trap was usually
left down for a couple of days. When it was hauled up, the
contents were transferred to a tin containing water, and then
taken to the hut and thawed out, for the contents always froze
during the quarter of a mile walk homeward. As soon as the
animals thawed out they were sorted into bottles and then killed
by various chemicals, put into spirits and bottled up for
examination when they reached England. Later on Murray found that
the trap business was not fruitful enough, so whenever a crack
opened in the bay ice, a line was let down, one end being made
fast at one end of the crack, and the length of the line allowed
to sink in the water horizontally for a distance of sixty yards.
A hole was dug at each end of the line and a small dredge was let
down and pulled along the bottom, being hauled up through the
hole at the far end. By this means much richer collections were
made, and rarely did the dredge come up without some interesting
specimens. When the crack froze over again, the work could still
be continued so long as the ice was broken at each end of the
line, and Priestley for a long time acted as Murray's assistant,
helping him to open the holes and pull the dredge.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-pic072"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>72. A VIEW NORTH, TOWARDS THE DYING SUN, IN
MARCH</small></p>
<p>When we took our walks abroad, every one kept their eyes open
for any interesting specimen of rock or any signs of plant life,
and Murray was greatly pleased one day when we brought back some
moss. This was found in a fairly sheltered spot beyond Back Door
Bay and was the only specimen that we obtained in the
neighbourhood of the winter quarters before the departure of the
sun. Occasionally we came across a small lichen and some curious
alg&aelig; growing in the volcanic earth, but these measured the extent
of the terrestrial vegetation in this latitude. In the north
polar regions, in a corresponding latitude, there are eighteen
different kinds of flowering plants, and there even exists a
small stunted tree, a species of willow.</p>
<p>Although terrestrial vegetation is so scanty in the Antarctic,
the same cannot be said of the sub-aqueous plant life. When we
first arrived and some of us walked across the north shore of
Cape Royds, we saw a great deal of open water in the lakes, and a
little later, when all these lakes were frozen over, we walked
across them, and looking down through the clear ice, could see
masses of brilliantly-coloured alg&aelig; and fungi. The investigation
of the plant life in the lakes was one of the principal things
undertaken by Murray, Priestley and the Professor during the
winter months. The reader has the plan of our winter quarters and
can follow easily the various places that are mentioned in the
course of this narrative.</p>
<p>After the Erebus party returned, a regular winter routine was
arranged for the camp. Brocklehurst took no part in the duties at
this time, for his frost-bitten foot prevented his moving about,
and shortly after his return Marshall saw that it would be
necessary to amputate at least part of the big toe. The rest of
the party all had a certain amount of work for the common weal,
apart from their own scientific duties. From the time we arrived
we always had a night-watchman, and now took turns to carry out
this important duty. Roberts was exempt from night-watchman's
duties, as he was busy with the cooking all day, so for the
greater part of the winter every thirteenth night each member
took the night watch. The ten-o'clock observations was the
night-watchman's first duty, and from that hour till nine o'clock
next morning he was responsible for the well-being and care of
the hut, ponies and dogs. His most important duties were the
two-hourly meteorological observations, the upkeep of the fire
and the care of the acetylene gas plant. The fire was kept going
all through the night, and hot water was ready for making the
breakfast when Roberts was called at 7.30 in the morning. The
night watch was by no means an unpleasant duty, and gave us each
an opportunity, when our turn came round, of washing clothes,
darning socks, writing and doing little odd jobs which could not
receive much attention during the day. The night-watchman also
generally took his bath either once a fortnight, or once a month
as his inclination prompted him.</p>
<p>Some individuals had a regular programme which they adhered to
strictly. For instance, one member, directly the rest of the
staff had gone to bed, cleared the small table in front of the
stove, spread a rug on it and settled down to a complicated game
of patience, having first armed himself with a supply of coffee
against the wiles of the drowsy god. After the regulation number
of games had been played, the despatch box was opened and
letters, private papers and odds and ends were carefully
inspected and replaced in their proper order, after which the
journal was written up. These important matters over, a ponderous
book on historical subjects received its share of attention.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-pic073"></a><img alt=""
src="1202361h-images/hs-pic073.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>73. AN ICE CAVE IN THE WINTER</small></p>
<p>Socks were the only articles of clothing that had constantly
to be repaired and various were the expedients used to replace
the heels, which, owing to the hard foot-gear, were always
showing gaping holes. These holes had to be constantly covered,
for we were not possessed of an unlimited number of any sort of
clothes, and many and varied were the patches. Some men used thin
leather, others canvas, and others again a sort of coarse flannel
to sew on instead of darning the heels of the socks. Towards the
end of the winter, the wardrobes of the various members of the
expedition were in a very patched condition.</p>
<p>During the earlier months the night-watchman was kept pretty
busy, for the ponies took a long time to get used to the stable
and often tried to break loose and upset things out there
generally. These sudden noises took the watchman out frequently
during the night, and it was a comfort to us when the animals at
last learned to keep fairly quiet in their stable. Every two
hours the observations and the fire and acetylene gas required
attention. The individual was fortunate who obtained a good bag
of coal for his night watch, with plenty of lumps in it, for
there was then no difficulty in keeping the temperature of the
hut up to 40&deg; Fahr., but a great deal of our coal was very fine
and caused much trouble during the night. To meet this difficulty
we had recourse to lumps of seal blubber, the watchman generally
laying in a stock for himself before his turn came for night
duty. When placed on top of the hot coal the blubber burned
fiercely, and it was a comfort to know that with the large supply
of seals that could easily be obtained in these latitudes, no
expedition need fear the lack of emergency fuel. There was no
perceptible smell from the blubber in burning, though fumes came
from the bit of hairy hide generally attached to it. The
thickness of the blubber varied from two to four inches. Some
watchmen during the night felt disinclined to do anything but
read and take the observations, and I was amongst this number,
for though I often made plans and resolutions as to washing and
other necessary jobs, when the time came these plans fell
through, with the exception of the bath.</p>
<p>Towards the middle of winter some of our party stayed up later
than during the time when there was more work outside, and there
gradually grew into existence an institution known as eleven
o'clock tea. The Professor was greatly attached to his cup of tea
and generally undertook the work of making it for men who were
still out of bed. Some of us preferred a cup of hot fresh milk,
which was easily made from the excellent dried milk of which we
had a large quantity. By one o'clock in the morning, however,
nearly all the occupants of the hut were wrapped in deep and more
or less noisy slumber. Some had a habit of talking in their
sleep, and their fitful phrases were carefully treasured up by
the night-watchman for retailing at the breakfast table next
morning; sometimes also the dreams of the night before were told
by the dreamer to his own great enjoyment, if not to that of his
audience. About five o'clock in the morning came the most trying
time for the watchman. Then one's eyes grew heavy and leaden, and
it took a deal of effort to prevent oneself from falling fast
asleep. Some of us went in for cooking more or less elaborate
meals. Marshall, who had been to a school of cookery before we
left England, turned out some quite respectable bread and cakes.
Though people jeered at the latter when placed on the table, one
noticed that next day there were never any left. At 7.30 a.m.
Roberts was called, and the watchman's night was nearly over. At
this hour also Armytage or Mackay was called to look after the
feeding of the ponies, but before mid-winter day Armytage had
taken over the entire responsibility of the stables and ponies,
and he was the only one to get up. At 8.30 a.m. all hands were
called, special attention being paid to turning out the messman
for the day, and after some minutes of luxurious
half-wakefulness, people began to get up, expressing their
opinions forcibly if the temperature of the hut was below
freezing point, and informing the night-watchman of his affinity
to Jonah if his report was that it was a windy morning. Dressing
was for some of the men a very simple affair, consisting merely
in putting on their boots and giving themselves a shake; others,
who undressed entirely, got out of their pyjamas into their cold
underclothing. At a quarter to nine the call came to let down the
table from its position near the roof, and the messman then
bundled the knives, forks and spoons on to the board, and at nine
o'clock sharp every one sat down to breakfast.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-pic074"></a><img alt=""
src="1202361h-images/hs-pic074.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>74. AN ICE CAVE IN THE WINTER (2)</small></p>
<p>The night-watchman's duties were over for a fortnight, and the
messman took on his work. The duties of the messman were more
onerous than those of the night-watchman. He began, as I have
stated, by laying the table--a simple operation owing to the
primitive conditions under which we lived. He then garnished this
with three or four sorts of hot sauces to tickle the tough
palates of some of our party. At nine o'clock, when we sat down,
the messman passed up the bowls of porridge and the big jug of
hot milk, which was the standing dish every day. Little was heard
in the way of conversation until this first course had been
disposed of. Then came the order from the messman, "up bowls",
and reserving our spoons for future use, the bowls were passed
along. If it were a "fruit day", that is a day when the second
course consisted of bottled fruit, the bowls were retained for
this popular dish.</p>
<p>At twenty-five minutes to ten breakfast was over and we had
had our smokes. All dishes were passed up, the table hoisted out
of the way, and the messman started to wash up the breakfast
things, assisted by his cubicle companion and by one or two
volunteers who would help him to dry up. Another of the party
swept out the hut; and this operation was performed three times a
day, so as to keep the building in a tidy state. After finishing
the breakfast things, the duty of the man in the house was to
replenish the melting-pots with ice, empty the ashes and tins
into the dust-box outside and get in a bag of coal. By half-past
ten the morning work was accomplished and the messman was free
until twenty minutes to one, when he put the water on for the
midday tea. At one o'clock tea was served and we had a sort of
counter lunch. This was a movable feast, for scientific and other
duties often made some of our party late, and after it was over
there was nothing for the messman to do in the afternoon except
to have sufficient water ready to provide tea at four o'clock. At
a quarter past six the table was brought down again and dinner,
the longest meal of the day, was served sharp at 6.30. One often
heard the messman anxiously inquiring what the dinner dishes were
going to consist of, the most popular from his point of view
being those which resulted in the least amount of grease on the
plates. Dinner was over soon after seven o'clock and then tea was
served. Tobacco and conversation kept us at table until 7.80,
after which the same routine of washing up and sweeping out the
hut was gone through. By 8.80 the messman had finished his duties
for the day, and his turn did not come round again for another
thirteen days. The state of the weather made the duties lighter
or heavier, for if the day happened to be windy, the emptying of
dishwater and ashes and the getting in of fresh ice was an
unpleasant job. In a blizzard it was necessary to put on one's
Burberries even to walk the few yards to the ice-box and
back.</p>

<small>75. MURRAY AND PRIESTLEY GOING DOWN A SHAFT DUG IN GREEN
LAKE DURING THE WINTER</small></p>
<p>In addition to the standing jobs of night-watchman and messman
there were also special duties for various members of the
expedition who had particular departments to look after. Adams
every morning, directly after breakfast, wound up the
chronometers and chronometer watches, and rated the instruments.
He then attended to the meteorological work and took out his pony
for exercise. If he were going far afield he delegated the
readings to some members of the scientific staff who were
generally in the vicinity of winter quarters. Marshall, as
surgeon, attended to any wounds, and issued necessary pills, and
then took out one of the ponies for exercise. Wild, who was
store-keeper, was responsible for the issuing of all stores to
Roberts, and had to open the cases of tinned food and dig out of
the snow drifts in which it was buried the meat required for the
day, either penguin, seal or mutton. Joyce fed the dogs after
breakfast, the puppies getting a dish of scraps over from our
meals after breakfast and after dinner. When daylight returned
after our long night, he worked at training the dogs to pull a
sledge every morning. The Professor generally went off to
"geologise" or to continue the plane-table survey of our winter
quarters, whilst Priestley and Murray worked on the floe dredging
or else took the temperatures of the ice in shafts which the
former had energetically sunk in the various lakes around us.
Mawson was occupied with his physical work, which included
auroral observations and the study of the structure of the ice,
the determination of atmospheric electricity and many other
things. In fact, we were all busy, and there was little cause for
us to find the time hang heavy on our hands; the winter months
sped by and this without our having to sleep through them, as has
often been done before by polar expeditions. This was due to the
fact that we were only a small party and that our household
duties, added to our scientific work, fully occupied our time. In
another chapter the reader will find a short summary of the
scientific work of each department, and will see from this that
in a practically unknown country and under such peculiar weather
conditions, there were many things of interest in natural science
to be studied.</p>

<small>76. ICE FLOWERS ON NEWLY FORMED SEA ICE EARLY IN THE
WINTER</small></p>
<p>It would only be repetition to chronicle our doings from day
to day during the months that elapsed from the disappearance of
the sun until the time arrived when the welcome daylight came
back to us. We lived under conditions of steady routine, affected
only by short spells of bad weather, and found amply sufficient
to occupy ourselves in our daily work, so that the spectre known
as "polar ennui" never made its appearance. Mid-winter's day and
birthdays were the occasions of festivals, when our teetotal
regime was broken through and a sort of mild spree indulged in.
Before the sun finally went hockey and football were the outdoor
games, while indoors at night some of us played bridge, poker and
dominoes. Joyce, Wild, Marston and Day during the winter months
spent much time in the production of the "Aurora Australis", the
first book ever written, printed, illustrated and bound in the
Antarctic. Through the generosity of Messrs. Joseph Causton and
Sons, Limited, we had been provided with a complete printing
outfit and the necessary paper for the book, and Joyce and Wild
had been given instruction in the art of type-setting and
printing, Marston being taught etching and lithography. They had
hardly become skilled craftsmen, but they had gained a good
working knowledge of the branches of the business. When we had
settled down in the winter quarters, Joyce and Wild set up the
little hand-press and sorted out the type, these preliminary
operations taking up all their spare time for some days, and then
they started to set and print the various contributions that were
sent in by members of the expedition. The early days of the
printing department were not exactly happy, for the two amateur
typesetters found themselves making many mistakes, and when they
had at last "set up" a page, made all the necessary corrections,
and printed off the necessary required number of copies, they had
to undertake the laborious work of "dissing", that is, of
distributing the type again. They plodded ahead steadily,
however, and soon became more skilful, until at the end of a
fortnight or three weeks they could print two pages in a day. A
lamp had to be placed under the type-rack to keep it warm, and a
lighted candle was put under the inking-plate, so that the ink
would keep reasonably thin in consistency. The great trouble
experienced by the printers at first was in securing the right
pressure on the printing-plate and even inking of the page, but
experience showed them where they had been at fault. Day
meanwhile prepared the binding by cleaning, planing, and
polishing wood taken from the Venesta cases in which our
provisions were packed. Marston reproduced the illustrations by
algraphy, or printing from aluminium plates. He had not got a
proper lithographing press, so had to use an ordinary etching
press, and he was handicapped by the fact that all our water had
a trace of salt in it. This mineral acted on the sensitive
plates, but Marston managed to produce what we all regarded as
creditable pictures. In its final form the book had about one
hundred and twenty pages, and it had at least assisted materially
to guard us from the danger of lack of occupation during the
polar night.</p>

<h3>THE POLAR NIGHT</h3>
<p><b>ON</b> March 13 we experienced a very fierce blizzard. The
hut shook and rocked in spite of our sheltered position, and
articles that we had left lying loose outside were scattered far
and wide. Even cases weighing from fifty to eighty pounds were
shifted from where they had been resting, showing the enormous
velocity of the wind. When the gale was over we put everything
that was likely to blow away into positions of greater safety. It
was on this day also that Murray found living microscopical
animals on some fungus that had been thawed out from a lump of
ice taken from the bottom of one of the lakes. This was one of
the most interesting biological discoveries that had been made in
the Antarctic, for the study of these minute creatures occupied
our biologist for a great part of his stay in the south, and
threw a new light on the capability of life to exist under
conditions of extreme cold and in the face of great variations of
temperature. We all became vastly interested in the rotifers
during our stay, and the work of the biologist in this respect
was watched with keen attention. From our point of view there was
an element of humour in the endeavours of Murray to slay the
little animals he had found. He used to thaw them out from a
block of ice, freeze them up again, and repeat this process
several times without producing any result as far as the rotifers
were concerned. Then he tested them in brine so strongly saline
that it would not freeze at a temperature above minus 7&deg; Fahr.,
and still the animals lived. A good proportion of them survived a
temperature of 200&deg; Fahr. It became a contest between rotifers
and scientist, and generally the rotifers seemed to triumph. The
biologist will tell his own story in another chapter. I noted in
my diary that in the middle of March, when daylight lasted eight
hours, we still had the skua gulls with us. The young birds were
now nearly all flying, but in some cases there were backward
youngsters that had not yet gained the use of their wings and
were still under the protection of their parents. The Adelie
penguins had practically deserted us, only about thirty remaining
in the rookery at this time. These birds had been moulting, but
all except six had finished the operation. We observed that when
moulting the penguin does not enter the sea for food, and seems
to live on its own blubber, taking no food but eating large
quantities of snow. On March 17, after snow had been falling all
night, Murray walked over to the rookery and saw only half the
penguins remaining, as he thought, but suddenly the others rose
up from under his feet. They had been lying down and had been
covered with snow, their bills only protruding. There were large
numbers of Weddell seals about at this time, and from the top of
the cliff we saw one lying asleep in the water, with his nostrils
just showing above the surface. There was still open water close
to our winter quarters, but young ice was beginning to form in
the bay again, and beautiful ice flowers appeared on the surface
of this young ice. About this time on the slopes of Erebus, a
mile and a half from the hut, a most interesting find of marine
serpul&aelig; was made on a moraine about 320 ft. above sea-level and
near this deposit was some yellow earth containing diatoms. We
could not at the time determine the cause of this peculiar
deposit, but it was certainly not what one might expect on such a
place as Ross Island, and both to geologists and biologists was a
matter of interest. So far we had not had any dearth of animal
life when viewed from the standpoint of the replenishing of our
larder, but towards the end of March the seals became less
numerous and the appearance of one of these was generally
followed by its death. Towards the end of the month Erebus became
very active, shooting out huge clouds of steam, which rose to the
height of 2000 ft. above the crater and were then caught by the
upper winds, giving us very definite information as to the trend
of the upper air-currents.</p>

<br>
<small>78. MAWSON'S CHEMICAL LABORATORY. THE BOTTLES WERE COATED
WITH ICE BY CONDENSATION FROM THE WARM, MOIST AIR OF THE
HUT</small></p>
<p>About the same time we began to see the aurora, and night
after night, except when the moon was at its full or the sky
overcast, the waving mystic lines of light were thrown across the
heavens, waxing and waning rapidly, falling into folds and
curtains, spreading out into great arches and sometimes shooting
vertical beams almost to the zenith. Sometimes, indeed often, the
aurora hovered over Mount Erebus, attracted no doubt by this
great isolated mass of rock, sometimes descending to the lower
slopes and always giving us an interest that never failed. When
the familiar cry of "aurora" was uttered by some one who had been
outside, most of us rushed out to see what new phase this
mysterious phenomenon would take, and we were indeed fortunate in
the frequency and brilliancy of the displays. Mawson, as
physicist, obtained a number of interesting notes which throw new
light on this difficult subject.</p>
<p>At the end of March there was still open water in the bay and
we observed a killer whale chasing a seal. About this time we
commenced digging a trench in Clear Lake and obtained, when we
came to water, samples of the bottom mud and fungus, which was
simply swarming with living organisms. The sunsets at the
beginning of April were wonderful; arches of prismatic colours,
crimson and golden-tinged clouds, hung in the heavens nearly all
day, for time, was going on and soon the sun would have deserted
us. The days grew shorter and shorter, and the twilight longer.
During these sunsets the western mountains stood out gloriously
and the summit of Erebus was wrapped in crimson when the lower
slopes had faded into grey. To Erebus and the western mountains
our eyes turned when the end of the long night grew near in the
month of August, for the mighty peaks are the first to catch up
and tell the tale of the coming glory and the last to drop the
crimson mantle from their high shoulders as night draws on.
Tongue and pencil would sadly fail in attempting to describe the
magic of the colouring in the days when the sun was leaving us.
The very clouds at this time were iridescent with rainbow hues.
The sunsets were poems. The change from twilight into night,
sometimes lit by a crescent moon, was extraordinarily beautiful,
for the white cliffs gave no part of their colour away, and the
rocks beside them did not part with their blackness, so the
effect of deepening night over these contrasts was singularly
weird. In my diary I noted that throughout April hardly a day
passed without an auroral display. On more than one occasion the
auroral showed distinct lines of colour, merging from a deep red
at the base of the line of light into a greenish hue on top.
About the beginning of April the temperature began to drop
considerably, and for some days in calm, still weather the
thermometer often registered 40&deg; below zero.</p>

<p>On April 6, Marshall decided that it was necessary to amputate
Brocklehurst's big toe, as there was no sign of it recovering
like the other toes from the frost-bite he had received on the
Erebus journey. The patient was put under chloroform and the
operation was witnessed by an interested and sympathetic
audience. After the bone had been removed, the sufferer was
shifted into my room, where he remained till just before
Mid-winter's day, when he was able to get out and move about
again. We had about April 8 one of the peculiar southerly
blizzards so common during our last expedition, the temperature
varying rapidly from minus 23&deg; to plus 4&deg; Fahr. This blizzard
continued till the evening of the 11th, and when it had abated we
found the bay and sound clear of ice again. I began to feel
rather worried about this and wished for it to freeze over, for
across the ice lay our road to the south. We observed
occasionally about this time that peculiar phenomenon of McMurdo
Sound called "earth shadows". Long dark bars, projected up into
the sky from the western mountains, made their appearance at
sunrise. These lines are due to the shadow of the giant Erebus
being cast across the western mountains. Our days were now
getting very short and the amount of daylight was a negligible
quantity. We boarded up the remainder of the windows, and
depended entirely upon the artificial light in the winter
quarters. The light given by the acetylene gas was brilliant, the
four burners lighting the whole of the hut.</p>
<p>We saw only two sea leopards during the whole period of our
stay in the Antarctic, and both these specimens were secured. The
first was killed soon after the sun left us. A seal was reported
to have been seen on the ice near the winter quarters, and Joyce
went down to kill it, as we wanted fresh meat and blubber. When
he got close he found that the animal was a sea leopard. He was
armed only with a club, and came running for a pistol, for the
sea leopards are savage and aggressive, and can move very rapidly
on the ice. When he got back, carrying a heavy revolver, the
animal was still in the same position, and he shot it twice
through the heart, and then twice through the skull. It had
remarkable tenacity of life, for it still struggled, and even
after a fifth ball had been put through its brain some minutes
elapsed before it turned over and lay still. Joyce skinned the
carcase, and he found that the first two bullets had actually
gone through the heart. He also reported that it seemed to have
two hearts, one of which had not been injured, but unfortunately
the organs that he brought back to the hut were found and
promptly devoured by some of the dogs, so that it is not possible
to produce evidence on the point. The specimen was a very fine
one, and was a welcome addition to our zoological collection.
Soon after the sun returned in the spring I sighted a seal that
seemed to be out of the ordinary off Cape Barne, about two miles
and a half from the hut. I found that it was a young sea leopard,
apparently suffering from starvation and I sent Joyce down to
kill it. I fancy that it had got on to the ice and had been
unable to find its way into the water again. Joyce killed it, and
found that the stomach was quite empty. When daylight returned
and sledging began about the middle of August, on one of our
excursions on the Cape Royds peninsula, we found growing under
volcanic earth a large quantity of fungus. This was of great
interest to Murray, as plant life of any sort is extremely rare
in the Antarctic. Shortly after this a strong blizzard cast up a
quantity of seaweed on our ice-foot; this was another piece of
good fortune, for on the last expedition we obtained very little
seaweed.</p>

<h3>SPRING SLEDGING JOURNEYS</h3>
<p><b>WHEN</b> Midwinter's Day had passed and the twilight that
presaged the return of the sun began to be more marked day by
day, I set on foot the arrangements for the sledging work in the
forthcoming spring. It was desirable that, at as early a date as
possible, we should place a depot of stores at a point to the
south, in preparation for the departure of the Southern Party,
which was to march towards the Pole. I hoped to make this depot
at least one hundred miles from the winter quarters. Then it was
desirable that we should secure some definite information
regarding the condition of the snow surface on the Barrier, and I
was also anxious to afford the various members of the expedition
some practice in sledging before the serious work commenced. Some
of us had been in the Antarctic before, but the majority of the
men had not yet had any experience of marching and camping on
snow and ice in low temperatures.</p>
<p>The ponies had been kept in good training by means of regular
exercise and constant attention during the winter, but although
they were thoroughly fit, and, indeed, apparently anxious for an
opportunity to work off some of their superfluous energy, I did
not propose to take them on the preliminary sledging journeys. It
seemed to be unwise to take any unnecessary risk of further loss
now that we had only four ponies left, few enough for the
southern journey later in the season. Sledging work in the
spring, when the temperature is very low, the light bad, and the
weather uncertain, is a rather severe strain on man and beast.
For this reason, man-hauling was the order for the first
journeys.</p>
<p>During the winter I had given a great deal of earnest
consideration to the question of the date at which the party that
was to march towards the Pole should start from the hut. The goal
that we hoped to attain lay over 880 statute miles to the south,
and the brief summer was all too short a time in which to march
so far into the unknown and return to winter quarters. The ship
would have to leave for the north about the end of February, for
the ice would then be closing in, and, moreover, we could not
hope to carry on our sledges much more than a three months'
supply of provisions, on anything like full rations. I finally
decided that the Southern Party should leave the winter quarters
about October 28, for if we started earlier it was probable that
the ponies would suffer from the severe cold at nights, and we
would gain no advantage from getting away early in the season if,
as a result, the ponies were incapacitated before we had made
much progress. The ponies would be sure to sweat when pulling
their heavy loads during the day, and a very low temperature when
they were resting would be dangerous in view of the fact that we
could not hope to provide them with shelter from the winds.</p>

<br>
<small>83. A MEMBER OF THE EXPEDITION TAKING HIS BATH</small></p>
<p>The date for the departure of the Southern Party having been
fixed, it became necessary to arrange for the laying of the depot
during the early spring, and I thought that the first step
towards this should be a preliminary journey on the Barrier
surface, in order to gain an idea of the conditions that would be
met with, and to ascertain whether the motor-car would be of
service, at any rate for the early portion of the journey. The
sun had not yet returned and the temperature was very low indeed,
but we had proved in the course of the <i>Discovery</i>
expedition that it is quite possible to travel under these
conditions. I therefore started on this preliminary journey on
August 12, taking with me Professor David, who was to lead the
Northern Party towards the South Magnetic Pole, and Bertram
Armytage, who was to take charge of the party that was to make a
journey into the mountains of the west later in the year. The
reader can imagine that it was not with feelings of unalloyed
pleasure that we turned our backs on the warm, well-found hut and
faced our little journey out into the semi-darkness and intense
cold, but we did get a certain amount of satisfaction from the
thought that at last we were actually beginning the work we had
come south to undertake.</p>
<p>We were equipped for a fortnight with provisions and camp
gear, packed on one sledge, and had three gallons of petroleum in
case we should decide to stay out longer. A gallon of oil will
last a party of three men for about ten days under ordinary
conditions, and we could get more food at Hut Point if we
required it. We took three one-man sleeping-bags, believing that
they would be sufficiently warm in spite of the low temperature.
The larger bags, holding two or three men, certainly give greater
warmth, for the occupants warm one another, but, on the other
hand, one's rest is very likely to be disturbed by the movements
of a companion. We were heavily clothed for this trip, because
the sun would not rise above the horizon until another ten days
had passed.</p>
<p>Our comrades turned out to see us off, and the pony Quan
pulled the sledge with our camp gear over the sea ice until we
got close to the glacier south of Cape Barne, about five miles
from the winter quarters. Then he was sent back, for the weather
was growing thick, and, as already explained, I did not want to
run any risk of losing another pony from our sadly diminished
team. We proceeded close in by the skuary, and a little further
on pitched camp for lunch. Professor David, whose thirst for
knowledge could not be quenched, immediately went off to
investigate the geology of the neighbourhood. After lunch we
started to pull our sledge round the coast towards Hut Point, but
the weather became worse, making progress difficult, and at 6
p.m. we camped close to the tide-crack at the south side of
Turk's Head. We slept well and soundly, although the temperature
was about forty degrees below zero, and the experience made me
more than ever convinced of the superiority of one-man
sleeping-bags.</p>
<p>On the following morning, August 13, we marched across to
Glacier Tongue, having to cross a wide crack that had been ridged
up by ice pressure between Tent Island and the Tongue. As soon as
we had crossed we saw the depot standing up clear against the
skyline on the Tongue. This was the depot that had been made by
the ship soon after our first arrival in the sound. We found no
difficulty in getting on to the Tongue, for a fairly gentle slope
led up from the sea-ice to the glacier surface. The snow had
blown over from the south during the winter and made a good way.
We found the depot intact, though the cases, lying on the ice,
had been bleached to a light yellow colour by the wind and sun.
We had lunch on the south side of the Tongue, and found there
another good way down to the sea ice. There is a very awkward
crack on the south side, but this can hardly be called a
tide-crack. I think it is due to the fact that the tide has more
effect on the sea ice than on the heavy mass of the Tongue,
though there is no doubt this also is afloat; the rise and fall
of the two sections of ice are not coincident, and a crack is
produced. The unaccustomed pulling made us tired, and we decided
to pitch a camp about four miles off Hut Point, before reaching
Castle Rock. Castle Rock is distant three miles and a half from
Hut Point, and we had always noticed that after we got abeam of
the rock the final march on to the hut seemed very long, for we
were always weary by that time. The temperature was now about
forty-five degrees below zero Fahr., and my two companions were
feeling for the first time the discomfort of using metal utensils
in this extreme cold. The Professor's fingers seemed to have a
wonderful power of resisting frost-bite. We were travelling in a
light that resembled broad twilight, but as the sun was still
below the horizon there were no shadows, and we stumbled a great
deal amongst the rough ice.</p>

<br>
<small>84. MARSTON IN HIS BED</small></p>
<p>We reached the old <i>Discovery</i> winter quarters at Hut
Point on the morning of August 14, and after a good breakfast I
took the Professor and Armytage over all the familiar ground. It
was very interesting to me to revisit the old scenes. There was
the place where, years before, when the <i>Discovery</i> was
lying fast in the ice close to the shore, we used to dig for the
ice that was required for the supply of fresh water. The marks of
the picks and shovels were still to be seen. I noticed an old
case bedded in the ice, and remembered the day when it had been
thrown away. Round the hut was collected a very large amount of
<i>d&eacute;bris</i>, including seal-skins and the skeletons of seals
and penguins. Some of the seal-skins had still blubber attached,
though the skuas had evidently been at work on them. We went up
towards the Gap and had a look at the only lake, or rather pool,
that lay near these winter quarters. It was quite a tiny sheet of
water in comparison with the large lakes at Cape Royds, and I
realised more fully the special advantages we had at our winter
quarters as far as biological and zoological work were concerned.
Through the Gap we saw the Barrier stretched out before
us&mdash;the long white road that we were shortly to tread. The
fascination of the unknown was strong upon me, and I longed to be
away towards the south on the journey that I hoped would lay bare
the mysteries of the place of the pole.</p>
<p>We climbed to the top of Crater Hill with a collecting-bag and
the Professor's camera, and here we took some photographs and
made an examination of the cone. Professor David expressed the
opinion that the ice-sheet had certainly passed over this hill,
which is about 1100 ft. high, for there was distinct evidence of
glaciation. We climbed along the ridge to Castle Rock, about four
miles to the north, and made an examination of the formation
there. Then we returned to the hut to have a square meal and get
ready for our journey across the Barrier.</p>
<p>The old hut had never been a very cheerful place, even when we
were camped alongside it in the <i>Discovery</i> and it looked
doubly inhospitable now, after having stood empty and neglected
for six years. One side was filled with cases of biscuit and
tinned meat, and the snow that had found its way in was lying in
great piles around the walls. There was no stove, for this had
been taken away with the <i>Discovery</i> and coal was scattered
about the floor with other <i>d&eacute;bris</i> and rubbish. Besides the
biscuits and the tinned beef and mutton there was some tea and
coffee stored in the hut. We cleared a spot on which to sleep,
and decided that we would use the cases of biscuit and meat to
build another hut inside the main one, so that the quarters would
be a little more cosy. I proposed to use this hut as a stores
depot in connection with the southern journey, for if the ice
broke out in the Sound unexpectedly early, it would be difficult
to convey provisions from Cape Royds to the Barrier, and,
moreover. Hut Point was twenty miles further south than our
winter quarters. We spent that night on the floor of the hut, and
slept fairly comfortably, though not as well as on the previous
night in the tent, because we were not so close to one
another.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-pic085"></a><img alt=""
src="1202361h-images/hs-pic085.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>85. THE NIGHT-WATCHMAN</small></p>
<p>On the morning of the following day (August 15) we started
away about 9 a.m., crossed the smooth ice to Winter Harbour, and
passed close round Cape Armitage. We there found cracks and
pressed-up ice, showing that there had been Barrier movement, and
about three miles further on we crossed the spot at which the sea
ice joins the Barrier, ascending a slope about eight feet high.
Directly we got on to the Barrier ice we noticed undulations on
the surface. We pushed along and got to a distance of about
twelve miles from Hut Point in eight hours. The surface generally
was hard, but there were very marked sastrugi, and at times
patches of soft snow. The conditions did not seem favourable for
the use of the motor-car because we had already found that the
machine could not go through soft snow for more than a few yards,
and I foresaw that if we brought it out on to the Barrier it
would not be able to do much in the soft surface that would have
to be traversed. The condition of the surface varied from mile to
mile, and it would be impracticable to keep changing the wheels
of the car in order to meet the requirements of each new
surface.</p>
<p>The temperature was very low, although the weather was fine.
At 6 p.m. the thermometer showed fifty-six degrees below zero,
and the petroleum used for the lamp had become milky in colour
and of a creamy consistency, That night the temperature fell
lower still, and the moisture in our sleeping-bags, from our
breath and Burberries, made us very uncomfortable when the bags
had thawed out with the warmth of our bodies. Everything we
touched was appallingly cold, and we got no sleep at all. The
next morning (August 16) the weather was threatening, and there
were indications of the approach of a blizzard, and I therefore
decided to march back to Hut Point, for there was no good purpose
to be served by taking unnecessary risks at that stage of the
expedition. We had some warm food, of which we stood sorely in
need after the severe night, and then started at 8 a.m. to return
to Hut Point. By hard marching, which had the additional
advantage of warming us up, we reached the old hut again at three
o'clock that afternoon, and we were highly delighted to get into
its shelter. The sun had not yet returned, and though there was a
strong light in the sky during the day, the Barrier was not
friendly under winter conditions.</p>
<p>We reached the hut none too soon, for a blizzard sprang up,
and for some days we had to remain in shelter. We utilised the
time by clearing up the portion of the hut that we proposed to
use, even sweeping it with an old broom we found, and building a
shelter of the packing-cases, piling them right up to the roof
round a space about twenty feet by ten; and thus we made
comparatively cosy quarters. We rigged a table for the
cooking-gear, and put everything neatly in order. My two
companions were, at this time, having their first experience of
polar life under marching conditions as far as equipment was
concerned, and they were gaining knowledge that proved very
useful to them on the later journeys.</p>

<br>
<small>86. MARSTON TRYING TO REVIVE MEMORIES OF OTHER
DAYS</small></p>
<p>On the morning of August 22, the day on which the sun once
more appeared above the horizon, we started back for the winter
quarters, leaving Hut Point at 5 a.m. in the face of a bitterly
cold wind from the north-east, with low drift. We marched without
a stop for nine miles, until we reached Glacier Tongue, and then
had an early lunch. An afternoon march of fourteen miles took us
to the winter quarters at Cape Royds, where we arrived at 5 p.m.
We were not expected at the hut, for the weather was thick and
windy, but our comrades were delighted to see us, and we had a
hearty dinner and enjoyed the luxury of a good bath.</p>
<p>The chief result of this journey was to convince me that we
could not place much reliance on the motor-car for the southern
journey. Professor David and Armytage had received a good baptism
of frost, and as it was very desirable that all the members of
the expedition should have personal experience of travelling over
the ice and snow in low temperatures before the real work began,
I arranged to despatch a small party every week to sledge stores
and equipment south to Hut Point. These journeys were much alike
in general character, though they all gave rise to incidents that
were afterwards related in the winter quarters, and it will be
sufficient if I describe briefly one trip as a specimen.</p>
<p>On September 1, Wild, Day and Priestley started for Hut Point
<i>vi&acirc;</i> Glacier Tongue with 450 lb. of gear and provisions,
their instructions being to leave 280 lb. of provisions at the
<i>Discovery</i> hut in readiness for the southern journey. They
made a start at 10.20 a.m., being accompanied by Brocklehurst
with a pony for the first five miles. The weather was fine, but a
very low barometer gave an indication that bad weather was
coining. I did not hesitate to let these parties face bad
weather, because the road they were to travel was well known, and
a rough experience would be very useful to the men later in the
expedition's work. The party camped for lunch at Inaccessible
Island, with a temperature at seventeen degrees below zero Fahr.,
and a fresh wind blowing from the north, with light drift. At
2.30 p.m. they left the island and started for Glacier Tongue,
the weather growing thicker, but they had no trouble with the
tide-cracks, and at the Tongue depot had a short rest, breaking a
bottle of frozen preserved cherries. Then they crossed the
Tongue, but as the drift was obscuring all landmarks, decided to
camp in the snow close to the south side of the Tongue.</p>
<p>Next morning the weather was still bad, and they were not able
to make a start until after noon. At 1.20 p.m. they ran out of
the northerly wind into light southerly airs with intervals of
calm, and they noticed that at the meeting of the two winds the
clouds of drift were formed into whirling columns, some of them
over forty feet high. They reached the <i>Discovery</i> hut at
4.30 p.m., and soon turned in, the temperature being forty
degrees below zero. When they dressed at 5.30 a.m. the next day
they found that a southerly wind with heavy drift rendered a
start on the return journey inadvisable. After breakfast they
walked over to Observation Hill, where they examined a set of
stakes which Ferrar and Wild had placed in the Gap glacier in
1902. The stakes showed that the movement of the glacier during
the six years since the stakes had been put into position had
amounted to a few inches only. The middle stake had advanced
eight inches and those next it on either side about six inches.
At noon the wind dropped, and although the drift was still thick,
the party started back, steering by the sastrugi till the Tongue
was reached. At the point at which they had run out of the north
wind on the outward journey, they again picked up a strong
northerly breeze. They did not sight Glacier Tongue till they
were close to it, and they found that owing to their fear of
going outside it, they had got too far east, and were about a
mile and a half from the depot. They started to march alongside
the Tongue towards the depot, but a strong south-easterly wind
came up, with heavy drift, so they decided to cross the Tongue,
and managed to climb up a drift after just missing a twenty-foot
drop into a hollow scooped out by the wind in the snow. By this
time the men could not see more than a yard or two before them,
and they hurried across the Tongue, taking the small crevasses in
their stride, and after travelling three-quarters of a mile
pulled up the sledge within half a dozen yards of the other edge
of the Tongue, at a point where they afterwards found there was a
forty-foot precipice. Wild felt his way along the edge with the
ice-axe until he came to a steep slope that seemed to promise a
means of descent, and then all three tobogganed down on the
sledge and camped for the night in the lee of the glacier, with a
blizzard blowing over them and the temperature rising, the result
being that everything was uncomfortably wet. They managed to
sleep, however, and when they awoke the next morning the weather
was clear, and they had an easy march in, being met beyond Cape
Barne by Joyce, Brocklehurst and the dogs. They had been absent
four days.</p>

<small>87. THE ACETYLENE GAS PLANT, OVER THE DOOR. MARSHALL
STANDING BY THE BAROMETER</small></p>
<p>Each party came back with adventures to relate, experiences to
compare, and its own views on various matters of detail connected
with sledge-travelling. The conversation in the hut after the
return of a party would become very animated, for each man had
definite opinions, born of experience, on such important
questions as how to dress and how to get into a sleeping-bag with
the minimum of discomfort. Curiously enough, everyone of the
parties encountered bad weather, but there were no accidents, and
all the men seemed to enjoy the work.</p>
<p>Early in September a party consisting of Adams, Marshall and
myself started for Hut Point, and we decided to make one march of
the twenty-three miles, and not camp on the way. We started at 8
a.m., and when we were nearly at the end of the journey, and were
struggling slowly through bad snow towards the hut, close to the
end of Hut Point, a strong blizzard came up. Fortunately I knew
the bearings of the hut, and how to get over the ice-foot. We
abandoned the extra weights we were pulling for the depot, and
managed to get to the hut at 10 p.m. in a sorely frost-bitten
condition, almost too tired to move. We were able to get
ourselves some hot food, however, and were soon all right again.
I mention the incident merely to show how constantly one has to
be on guard against the onslaughts of the elements in the
inhospitable regions of the south.</p>

<h3>SOUTHERN DEPOT JOURNEY</h3>
<p><b>BY</b> the middle of September a good supply of provisions,
oil, and gear had been stored at Hut Point in preparation for the
sledge journeys. All the supplies required for the southern
journey had been taken there, in order that the start might be
made from the most southern base available. During this period,
while the men were gaining experience and getting into training,
the ponies were being exercised regularly along the sea ice from
winter quarters across to Cape Barne, and I was more than
satisfied with the way in which they did their work. I felt that
the little animals were going to justify the confidence I had
reposed in them when I had brought them all the way from
Manchuria to the bleak Antarctic. I tried the ponies with loads
of varying weights in order to ascertain as closely as possible
how much they could haul with maximum efficiency, and after
watching the results of the experiments very carefully came to
the conclusion that a load of 650 lb. per pony should be the
maximum. It was obvious that if the animals were overloaded their
speed would be reduced, so that there would be no gain to us, and
if we were to accomplish a good journey to the south it was
important that they should not be tired out in the early stages
of the march over the Barrier surface. The weight I have
mentioned was to include that of the sledge itself, which I have
already stated was about 60 lb. When I came to consider the
question of weight, I realised the full seriousness of the loss
the expedition had sustained when the other four ponies were lost
during the winter, for I saw that we would not be able to take
with us towards the Pole as much food as I should have liked.</p>
<p>The dogs, whose numbers had been increased by births until we
had a fairly large team, were trained, but I did not see much
scope for them on the southern journey. I knew from past
experience that dogs would not travel when low drift was blowing
in their faces, and such drift was to be expected fairly often on
the Barrier surface, even in the sunnier.</p>
<p>During the month of May, Day had taken the engine out of the
motor-car, a task of no little difficulty in a temperature below
zero, and after cleaning every part thoroughly, had packed it
away in a case for the winter. On September 14, when the light
was beginning to get stronger, he got the engine back into the
car, working in a temperature of minus 10&deg; Fahr., and began
preparations for the journeys over the ice. The car made its
first journey of importance on September 19, and by that time
experiments had proved that an extensive reduction in weight was
necessary if the machine was to accomplish anything at all. Day
therefore proceeded to strip it of every bit of wood or metal not
absolutely essential to running efficiency. In its final form the
bare chassis carried the engine and one seat for the driver. No
great difficulties were experienced in connection with the
engine, even when the temperature was many degrees below zero.
The mixing chamber and inlet pipes were warmed up by burning
petrol in a small dish rigged round the carburetter just below
the throttle, the carburetter being flooded at the same time. By
the time the petrol had burned out the engine would start with a
few turns of the crank. The petrol tank carried twenty-three
gallons, and fed the carburetter by pressure from a small
hand-pump. Accumulator ignition was found to be impossible, as
the acid and water froze solid, but the magneto gave no trouble.
A second petrol tank, which fed the carburetter by gravity, was
taken off in order to save weight. The car had a drip-feed
lubricator for oiling the crank-case, but as the oil got frozen
in the pipes it was not at all reliable, so oil was poured into
the case through holes every five miles or so. Ordinary heavy oil
got thick at a temperature of 20&deg; Fahr., and solid at zero Fahr.,
but a special Antarctic oil supplied by Messrs. Price and Co.
gave good results even at a temperature of minus 30&deg; Fahr.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-pic089"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>89. THE LEADER OF THE EXPEDITION IN WINTER
GARB</small></p>
<p>The power was transmitted to the gearbox through a
leather-faced case clutch, and the gears, which were specially
low, were four speeds forward and one reverse. When Day first
tried to get the car under way he found that he could not
de-clutch, as the leather had frozen to the metal, and it was
necessary to warm up the parts and dry them off with a sponge. We
had wheels of several types, but soon found that ordinary wheels
with rubber tyres and non-skid chains gave the best results. At a
temperature of minus 30&deg; Fahr. the tyres became quite hard, with
no spring in them, but we had no tyre troubles at all, even when
the ice was very rough.</p>
<p>On September 19 the motor-car took Day, Brocklehurst and
Adams, with a sledge on which were packed 750 lb. of stores, to
lay a depot at Glacier Tongue for the southern journey. There was
a stiff breeze blowing, with a temperature of minus 23&deg; Fahr.,
but the car ran well for eight miles as far as Inaccessible
Island over the sea ice. Then it got into the heavy sastrugi
caused by the wind blowing between Inaccessible Island and Tent
Island, and was stopped by soft snow, into which it ploughed
deeply. An easier route was found about a mile further north, at
a point where the sastrugi were less marked. The car reached a
point a quarter of a mile distant from the Tongue, and the sledge
was hauled the rest of the way by the men, as the surface was
very soft. The return journey presented fewer difficulties, for
Day was able to drive in the outward tracks. The total distance
covered by the car that day was at least thirty miles, and the
speed had ranged from three to fifteen miles an hour. The three
men left the winter quarters at 9.30 a.m., and arrived back at
6.45 p.m., having accomplished an amount of work that would have
occupied six men for two or three days without the assistance of
the car.</p>
<p>It was always a matter of difficulty to get the car from the
hut to the sea ice, and this was often the most formidable part
of a journey. A short slope, at an angle of about forty-five
degrees, led down to the large tide-crack, and beyond this were
some smaller cracks and one large crack with hummocky ice on
either side of it and big drifts. Sometimes the car got stuck
altogether, and then the assistance of all hands would be
required to pull and push. The car could not be left on the sea
ice because no shelter could be provided there, and a blizzard
might sweep down at very short notice.</p>
<p>About September 14 we started to make active preparations for
the depot journey. I decided to place a depot one hundred
geographical miles south of the <i>Discovery</i> winter quarters,
the depot to consist of pony maize. If by any chance we were not
able to pick it up when going south on our attempt to reach the
Pole, the loss of the maize would be a less serious matter than
the loss of any portion of the provisions for our own
consumption. I did not anticipate that there would be much
difficulty in picking up the depot again, but there was the
possibility that severe weather might bury the stores and
obliterate any marks set up for our guidance. I picked a depot
party consisting of Adams, Marshall, Wild, Joyce and Marston,
with myself as the sixth man. I did not propose to take either
ponies or dogs, for reasons I have already explained. We took two
tents, three men going in each, and two three-man sleeping-bags,
for we expected to meet with very low temperatures. The
disadvantages of these bags, as I have already stated, is that
one's sleep is liable to be disturbed, but this would not matter
so much on a comparatively short journey, and we would probably
need the additional warmth derived from one another's bodies.
There is no doubt in my mind that for extended journeys in the
polar regions the use of one-man bags is desirable. Apart from
all other considerations, it is a great comfort to have a little
home of one's own into which to retire when the day's work is
done, secure from all interruptions. The opening can be adjusted
just as the occupant pleases, whereas if there are two or three
men in the one bag, one may think the atmosphere suffocating,
while another objects to the draught.</p>

<br>
<small>90. THE HUT, WITH MOUNT EREBUS IN THE BACKGROUND, IN THE
AUTUMN</small></p>
<p>The depot party left Cape Royds on September 22, with a load
of about 170 lb. per man, and made the first part of the journey
in the motor-car. Day was able to get the machine, with the
sledges towed behind and all the members of the party either on
the car or the sledges, as far as Inaccessible Island, moving at
a speed of about six miles an hour. I heard afterwards that the
car ran back to the hut, a distance of eight miles, in twenty
minutes. We took the sledges on ourselves over a fairly good
surface, and spent the first night at the <i>Discovery</i> hut.
Three of the puppies had followed the car when we started away
from the winter quarters, and they had firmly refused to go back
with it, apparently because Joyce had been in the habit of
feeding them, and they were not willing to leave him. They
followed us right to Hut Point, the first long march of their
short lives, and after devouring all the meat and biscuits we
would give them, they settled down in a corner of the hut for the
night. We could not take the poor little animals out on to the
Barrier with us, though they would have followed us readily
enough, and we decided that the only thing to do was to shut them
up in the hut until we came back. There was plenty of snow there,
so that they would not want for water, and we opened a box of
biscuits and some tinned meat, and left the food where they could
reach it. Their anxious barks and whines followed us as we moved
off southwards.</p>
<p>The journey was a severe one, for the temperature got down to
fifty-nine degrees below zero Fahr., with blizzard winds, but as
we travelled over ground that had become fairly familiar in the
course of the previous expedition, I will not deal with our
experiences in any great detail. The first blizzard struck us
when we were south of White Island. We started off in the
morning, though there was a stiff breeze blowing and the weather
looked threatening, and marched until about 10.30 a.m. Then the
gusts became more fierce, and the drift got so thick that we had
to camp. We only put up one tent at first, in the hope that we
would be able to start again in a few hours, but the wind
continued, so we erected the other tent and abandoned hope of
marching farther that day. We were able to make an early start on
the following morning, the 26th. The petroleum for our stoves was
practically frozen at times, refusing to run at all. We got into
pressure ridges when some distance north of Minna Bluff, but
fortunately we were having good weather at this time. Most of us
had the experience at one time or other of dropping into a
crevasse to the length of our harness. Adams, Marshall and
Marston had not yet become accustomed to the little misadventures
incidental to travel in the Antarctic, but it did not take them
long to become inured. I remember one night hearing Marston
asking whether it would be safe to have a look round outside.
"Well, you can play 'perhaps' if you like", remarked some one.
Marston did not understand, and the other man explained that the
"game" was played on the basis of "perhaps you go down and
perhaps you don't". Marston was making sketches and taking notes
of colours, and his work was rendered very difficult by the
extreme cold. There were wonderful lights in the sky at dawn and
dusk, and the snow and ice presented the gradations of delicate
colour that can hardly be realised by those who have never seen a
polar landscape, but heavy mits, with one compartment for the
four fingers and another for the thumb, are hardly designed for
the handling of pencil or crayons, and the use of bare hands was
out of the question. Marston persisted in the face of his various
troubles, and managed to secure a good deal of interesting and
valuable material.</p>
<p>We left one bag of maize at a depot on the way out, but we
never picked this up again. The main depot was laid in latitude
79.36&deg; South, longitude 168&deg; East, a distance of about one
hundred and twenty geographical miles from the winter quarters.
We reached it on October 6. This depot was out of sight of land,
and was marked with an upturned sledge and a black flag on a
bamboo rod. We left there a gallon tin of oil and 167 lb. of pony
maize, so that our load would be lightened considerably for the
first portion of the journey when we started south. This southern
depot we called Depot A.</p>
<p>The weather was bad and the temperature low on the journey
back, and I decided to take the outside course in order to avoid
the crevasses as much as possible. The disturbed condition of the
ice in this neighbourhood is caused by the Barrier impinging on
the Bluff, and by the glaciers coming down from Mount Discovery.
As had been the case on the outward journey, we were delayed a
good deal by blizzards, and owing to this fact we had to make
very long marches when the weather was fine, for we had brought
food for twenty days only. We experienced a very severe blizzard
before we reached White Island. We had got away from camp at 4
a.m. that morning, and had been marching for about an hour and a
half when the wind that was following us began to approach
blizzard strength. Four men kept the traces taut while two men
held the sledge from behind, but even then the sledge sometimes
caught up to the men in front. As the wind increased the drifting
snow got thicker and finer, and after a short time we could not
see more than ten or fifteen yards ahead. Then we found that we
were amongst crevasses, for first one man and then another put
his foot through a snow lid, and we therefore stopped and camped.
The wind increased rapidly, and it took about an hour and a half
of hard work to get the tents pitched. The snow blew into our
faces and formed masks of ice, and several members of the party
got bad frost-bites. When we finally got the tents up, we had to
lie in them for thirty hours. As a result of such delays, we did
not reach the old <i>Discovery</i> winter quarters until October
13. We had been twenty-one days out, and our food was finished,
though we had been able to keep on full rations until the last
day. We had been able to march only on fourteen and a half days,
but we had made some good journeys on the way back, having
covered as much as twenty-five miles in a day.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="hs-colpicF"></a><img alt=""
src="1202361h-images/hs-colpicF.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>F. FULL MOON IN THE WINTER</small></p>
<p>We found our little friends, the puppies, safe and sound in
the hut, and their delight at seeing us again was simply huge.
Directly they heard us approaching they started to make every
effort in their power to attract attention, and the moment the
door was opened they rushed out and fairly threw themselves upon
us. They twined their fat little bodies round our boots and
yelped in an ecstasy of welcome. Poor little dogs, they had, no
doubt, been lonely and frightened during the three weeks they had
spent in the hut, though physically they seemed to have been
comfortable enough. They had eaten all the meat left for them,
but they still had biscuits, and they had put on flesh. Their
coats were quite black owing to their having lain amongst the
fragments of coal on the floor.</p>
<p>The next day we started for Cape Royds, and had the good
fortune to meet the motor-car, driven by Day, at a point about a
mile and a half south of Cape Barne. The sledges were soon
hitched on behind, and we drove back triumphantly to the winter
quarters. It was October 18 and we had travelled 320 statute
miles since we left the hut twenty-two days before. We arrived
hungry and rather tired, and were able to appreciate at their
full value the warmth and comfort of our little hut. The
adventurous puppies were outside doing their best to convince
their friends and relatives that they were not three strangers
trying to force their way into the community.</p>
<p>During our absence the Northern Party, consisting of Professor
David, Mawson and Mackay, had started on the journey that was to
result in the attainment of the South Magnetic Pole. I had
instructed the Professor, who was in command of this party, to
get away on October 1, or as soon after that date as weather and
other circumstances would permit. On September 25 Professor
David, Priestley and Day took 850 lb. of stores for the northern
journey out into the middle of the sound, a distance of about
fourteen miles, by means of the motor-car. Day had intended to go
to Dinley Isles, but sastrugi that stretched right across the ice
of the sound prevented this. The sastrugi were in places two feet
deep, and the wheels could get no grip in the soft snow, into
which they sank deeply. Some very bad cracks were encountered,
including one two feet wide, but the machine bumped over without
damage. A second load of stores was taken out by the car on
October 3, some bad weather having intervened. Professor David,
Day, Priestley and Mackay went out on this occasion, and the
journey produced a larger crop of minor accidents than usual,
though men were always liable to sustain cuts and bruises when
handling the car at a low temperature and in difficult
situations. Priestley got a nail torn off, the Professor jammed a
finger in the front wheel, and Mackay suffered a Collis fracture
of the wrist from the starting handle. One crack that lay across
the course delayed the party for two hours, and the front axle
was bent by another crack, into which the wheels dropped when the
car was travelling at a speed of about twelve miles an hour.</p>
<p>The Northern Party finally left the winter quarters on October
5, picked up their stores where the motor-car had deposited them,
and began their long journey over the sea ice along the coast.
Day carried them in the car for the first three miles, but then
had to return as the weather was becoming very thick and the
temperature was falling. Mackay's wrist was troublesome, but it
did not prevent him hauling in harness. I had said good-bye to
Professor David and his two companions on September 22, 1908, and
I did not see them again until March 1, 1909. In another chapter
the Professor himself tells the story of the northern
journey.</p>

<h3>PREPARATION FOR THE SOUTHERN JOURNEY</h3>
<p><b>THE</b> southern sledging-party was to leave the winter
quarters on October 29, and immediately on the return of the
depot party we started to make the final preparations for the
attempt to reach the South Pole. I decided that four men should
go south, I myself to be one of them, and that we should take
provisions for ninety-one days; this amount of food, with the
other equipment, would bring the load per pony up to the weight
fixed as a result of experiments as the maximum load. It will be
remembered that in outlining the scheme of the expedition in the
early part of 1907 I had proposed that a party should travel to
the east across the Barrier surface towards King Edward VII Land,
with the object of solving, if possible, the mystery of the
Barrier itself, and securing some information about the land on
the other side of it. The accidents that had left us with only
four ponies caused me to abandon this project. The ponies would
have to go south, the motor-car would not travel on the Barrier,
and the dogs were required for the southern depot journey. I
deemed it best to confine the efforts of the sledging-parties to
the two Poles, Geographical and Magnetic, and to send a third
party into the western mountains with the object of studying
geological conditions and, in particular, of searching for
fossils.</p>
<p>The men selected to go with me on the southern journey were
Adams, Marshall and Wild. A supporting-party was to accompany us
for a certain distance in order that we might start fairly fresh
from a point beyond the rough ice off Minna Bluff, and we would
take the four ponies and four sledges. It was with some regret
that I decided that the motor-car would have to stay behind. The
trials that we had made in the neighbourhood of the winter
quarters had proved that the car could not travel over a soft
snow surface, and the depot journey had shown me that the surface
of the Barrier was covered with soft snow, much softer and
heavier than it had been in 1902, at the time of the
<i>Discovery</i> expedition. In fact I was satisfied that, with
the Barrier in its then condition, no wheeled vehicle could
travel over it. The wheels would simply sink in until the body of
the car rested on the snowy surface. We had made alterations in
the wheels and we had reduced the weight of the car to an
absolute minimum by the removal of every unnecessary part, but
still it could do little on a soft surface, and it would
certainly be quite useless with any weight behind, for the
driving wheels would simply scoop holes for themselves. The use
of sledge-runners under the front wheels, with broad, spiked
driving-wheels, might have enabled us to get the car over some of
the soft surfaces, but this equipment would not have been
satisfactory on hard, rough ice, and constant changes would
occupy too much time. I had confidence in the ponies, and I
thought it best not to attempt to take the car south from the
winter quarters.</p>
<p>The provisioning of the Southern Party was a matter that
received long and anxious consideration. Marshall went very
carefully into the question of the relative food values of the
various supplies, and we were able to derive much useful
information from the experience of previous expeditions. We
decided on a daily ration of 34 oz. per man; the total weight of
food to be carried, on the basis of supplies for ninety-one days,
would therefore be 773&frac12; lb. The staple items were to be biscuits
and pemmican. The biscuits, as I have stated, were of wheatmeal
with 25 per cent. of plasmon added, and analysis showed that they
did not contain more than 3 per cent. of water. The pemmican had
been supplied by Beauvais, of Copenhagen, and consisted of the
finest beef, dried and powdered, with 60 per cent. of beef fat
added. It contained only a small percentage of water. The effort
of the polar explorer is to get his foods as free from water as
possible, for the moisture represents so much useless weight to
be carried.</p>
<p>The daily allowance of food for each man on the journey, as
long as full rations were given, was to be as follows:</p>

<p>Tea, salt and pepper were extras not weighed in with the daily
allowance. We used about two ounces of tea per day for the four
men. The salt and pepper were carried in small bags, each bag to
last one week. Some of the biscuit had been broken up, and 1 lb.
per week for each man was intended to be used for thickening the
hoosh, the amount so used to be deducted from the ordinary
allowance of biscuit.</p>

<p>We left the winter quarters with ten pounds of tea, but took
an additional pound from the <i>Discovery</i> hut before we moved
on to the Barrier. The allowance of salt amounted to two ounces
per week per man, and that of pepper to two ounces per fortnight
for the four men.</p>
<p>The biscuits were packed in 25 lb. tins, and they weighed
about fourteen to the pound. All the other foods we packed in
calico bags, each bag holding one week's supply of the particular
article. Larger bags in turn contained a fortnight's rations,
from which a week's food would be taken as required. The weight
of one of the fortnightly bags, which did not include the
biscuit, was 98 lb.</p>
<p>The clothing worn by each man when we started on the southern
journey was very light. We had experimented on the spring
sledging journey, and had proved that it was quite possible, even
in very low temperatures, to abandon the heavy pilot cloth
garments, which tire the wearer by their own weight, and to march
in woollen undergarments and windproof overalls. The personal
equipment of the members of the Southern Party was as
follows:</p>
<p class="poem">Woollen pyjama trousers.<br>
Woollen singlet.<br>
Woollen shirt.<br>
Woollen guernsey.<br>
Two pairs thick socks.<br>
One pair finnesko.<br>
Burberry overalls.<br>
Balaclava.<br>
Burberry head covering.<br>
Woollen mits.<br>
Fur mits.</p>
<p>Each man had his spare clothing and his personal belongings in
a bag, the total weight of which was about seventeen pounds. The
contents of each of these bags, in addition to diaries, letters
and similar personal possessions, was as follows:</p>
<p class="poem">Pyjama sleeping-jacket.<br>
Pyjama trousers, spare.<br>
Eight pairs woollen socks.<br>
Three pairs finnesko.<br>
Supply sennegrass.<br>
Three pairs mittens.<br>
Spare woollen helmet.<br>
One pair spiked ski-boots.<br>
Woollen muffler.<br>
Two pairs goggles, one smoked, one coloured.<br>
Roll lamp-wick, for tying on mits and finnesko.<br>
Sledge flag.<br>
Tobacco and matches.</p>
<p>There was also a small repair bag, with spare pieces of
Burberry cloth for patching our wind clothes, needles, thread and
buttons.</p>
<p>The other items of our equipment were as follows:</p>
<blockquote>Two tents, with poles and floorcloths, each weighing
complete 30 lb.<br>
Four sleeping-bags, each weighing 10 lb. when dry.<br>
One cooker, with spare inner pot.<br>
Two primus lamps, with spare parts.<br>
Thirteen gallons paraffin oil.<br>
One gallon methylated spirits.<br>
Two heavy knives.<br>
One .450 revolver, with twelve cartridges, weighing 4 lb.<br>
Four ice-axes (each 3 lb.).<br>
Two shovels (each 6 lb.).<br>
Eight 12 ft. bamboos.<br>
Eight depot flags.<br>
Two sledge-meters.<br>
Four pony rugs.<br>
Wire tether.<br>
Four nose-bags.<br>
Spare straps and rivets for repairing harness.<br>
Roll of creosoted hemp rope.<br>
Charts.<br>
Ten fathoms of alpine rope.<br>
Two Union Jacks (Queen's flag and another).<br>
Brass cylinder containing small Union Jack stamps and documents,
for furthest south point.</blockquote>
<p>Adams, Marshall and myself each carried a large
pocket-knife.</p>
<p>The scientific equipment had to be cut down as far as was
reasonably possible in order to save weight, but we were not
badly off in this respect. We had:</p>
<blockquote>One 3-in. theodolite on stand.<br>
Three chronometer watches.<br>
Three compasses (pocket).<br>
Six thermometers.<br>
One hypsometer and two thermometers.<br>
One camera and three dozen plates (quarter-plate by Newman and
Guardia).<br>
One case surveying instruments, dividers, &amp;c.<br>
Two prismatic compasses.<br>
One sextant and artificial horizon.<br>
Two volumes of "Hints to Travellers".<br>
One chart and spare paper.</blockquote>
<p>The medical chest took the form of a small brown leather bag,
and it contained the following items, the chemicals being in
compressed forms:</p>
<blockquote>One tube laxative pills.<br>
One tube boric acid.<br>
One tube perchloride of mercury.<br>
One tube iron and arsenic composition.<br>
One tube quinine bisulphate.<br>
One tube eye soloids.<br>
One tube hemesins (adrenalin).<br>
Two tubes cocaine hydrochloride.<br>
Two tubes zinc sulphate.<br>
One tube aloin compound.<br>
One tube crete aromat cum opio.<br>
One tube chlorodyne.<br>
One tube sulphonal.<br>
One tube soda mint.<br>
One tube bismuth pepsin charcoal.<br>
One tube potassium chlorate.<br>
One tube ammonium bromide.<br>
One tube ginger essence.<br>
One tube sodium salicylate.<br>
One tube morphine sulphate.<br>
Two clinical thermometers.</blockquote>

<p>We had also the following medical stores:</p>

Two ounces compressed cyanide gauge.<br>
Two pieces wood splinting.<br>

One pocket surgical dressing-case.<br>
Two pairs spare goggles and spare glasses.<br>
One pair molar dental forceps.<br>
Two bottles "Newskin".<br>
Six hundred tabloids Easton's syrup (1 dr.).<br>
Six ounces Emergency Oxo.</blockquote>
<p>The total weight of the drugs and medical stores was seven
pounds.</p>
<p>Four eleven-foot sledges were to be taken, one for each pony.
Each sledge was fitted with straps, five placed at intervals
along its length, so that the stores and equipment might be made
fast. The buckle end of a strap was on one side and the hauling
end on the other alternately. At either end of each sledge was
fixed a box. These boxes contained the instruments, burning oil,
primus lamps, medical stores and other small articles, and on top
of one of them was lashed the cooker. The sledge harness for
man-hauling was attached to a becket at the bow of the
sledge.</p>
<p>The harness for the ponies was made with a broad leather band
round the chest and traces of alpine rope running from this.
There was a strap over the neck to support the hauling band and a
strap across the back, with a girth. The traces were toggled to a
swingle-tree, which was attached to the sledge bow in the centre.
Our great fear was that the ponies would chafe from the rubbing
of the harness when they perspired and the moisture congealed
from the cold, but we had very little trouble from this cause.
All the buckles were leather-covered in order that no metal might
touch the ponies, and we took great care to keep the harness free
from ice and dirt.</p>
<p>The food for the ponies on the march consisted of maize and
Maujee ration, with a little of the Australian compressed fodder.
Each pony was to have 10 lb. of food per day, and we took in all
900 lb. of food for the animals. The maize was carried in linen
bags weighing about eighty pounds each, as was also the Maujee
ration.</p>
<p>I had decided that Murray should be in charge of the
expedition during the absence of the Southern Party, and I left
with him instructions covering, as far as I could see, all
possible contingencies. Priestley was to be given facilities for
examining the geological conditions on the north slope of Erebus,
and at the beginning of December Armitage, Priestley and
Brocklehurst were to be sent to lay a depot for the Northern
Party and then to proceed into the western mountains. All the
routine scientific work was to be carried on, and stores were to
be transported to Glacier Tongue and Hut Point in case the ice
broke up in the sound and cut off the winter quarters from the
points further south. On January 15 a depot party was to proceed
south in order to place at a point off Minna Bluff sufficient
stores to provide for the return journey of the Southern Party
from that point. The depot party, which was to be under the
command of Joyce, was to return to Hut Point, reload its sledge,
and march out to the depot a second time, to await the arrival of
the Southern Party there until February 10. If we had then not
arrived, they were to go back to Hut Point and thence to the
ship.</p>
<p>If the ice in the sound broke out, the ship, which should
reach the winter quarters late in December or early in January,
was to watch for the Northern and Western Parties, which would
signal from Butter Point. If nothing had been heard of Professor
David, Mawson and Mackay by February 1, the <i>Nimrod</i> was to
proceed to Granite Harbour and search for record on the north
side of the entrance to the harbour. If there was no record the
ship was to proceed north as far as the low beach on the north
side of the Drygalski Barrier, keeping as close as practicable to
the shore and making a thorough search for the party. The
<i>Nimrod</i> was to return to winter quarters not later than
February 10. In the event of the non-return of the Southern
Party, the <i>Nimrod</i> was to make another search for the
Northern Party, examining the coast as thoroughly as was
compatible with the safety of the ship. The return of the
Southern Party was to be expected after the first week in
February, and the men at the winter quarters were to watch for a
flash signal from Glacier Tongue between noon and 1 p.m. each
day. If the ice had broken out south of the Tongue, the ship was
to be sent down to Hut Point occasionally to look for the party.
In the meantime all the collections and gear were to be placed on
board the ship in preparation for the final departure. It was
necessary to prepare for the non-return of the Southern Party,
although we were taking no gloomy view of our prospects, and I
therefore left full instructions for the conduct of the
expedition in the event of accident. My instructions to Murray on
this point were as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"In the event of the non-arrival of the Southern
Party by February 25 you are to land sufficient coal and
provisions to support a party of seven men for one year at Cape
Royds. You are then to pick three men to stay behind, and you
will pick these men from volunteers. If there are no volunteers,
which is highly improbable, you are to select three men and order
them to stay. You will give these three men instructions to
proceed at once to the south on the 168th meridian in search of
the Southern Party, the leader using discretion as to the time
they should take over the search. You are to leave all the dogs
ashore to assist this party. You will instruct them to search for
the remains of the Southern Party in the following summer. You
are to use your discretion as to any other orders you may think
it desirable to issue. The <i>Nimrod</i> is to land as much
sugar, fruit and jam as possible. There are ample provisions
otherwise, but anything in the way of dainties or special
vegetables should be landed. There are sufficient ordinary
vegetables. The <i>Nimrod</i> is also to land any clothing that
you may think necessary for the party of three men remaining
behind. . . . In the event of J. B. Adams returning and my
non-return, he is in full command of the whole expedition, and
has my instructions in the matter. The ship must on the 1st of
March steam to the entrance of McMurdo Sound to see the ice
conditions, and if there is no heavy pack likely to hold her up,
she can return to Cape Royds again; but I think that the utmost
limit for the date to which you should remain is the 10th of
March, 1909, as if we have not returned by then something very
serious must have happened."</blockquote>
<p>My instructions provided for the conclusion of the work of the
expedition in its various branches, and for the steps to be taken
for the relief of the men left in the Antarctic in the case of
the non-return of the Southern Party. Everything was ready for
the start of the journey towards the Pole as the end of October
approached, and we looked forward with keen anticipation to the
venture. The supporting-party was to consist of Joyce, Marston,
Priestley, Armytage and Brocklehurst, and was to accompany us for
ten days. Day was to have been a member of this party, but he
damaged his foot while tobogganing down a slope at the winter
quarters, and had to stay behind. The weather was not very good
during our last days at the hut, but there were signs that summer
was approaching. The ponies were in good condition. We spent the
last few days overhauling the sledges and equipment, and making
sure that everything was sound and in its right place. In the
evenings we wrote letters for those at home, to be delivered in
the event of our not returning from the unknown regions into
which we hoped to penetrate.</p>

<h3>FIRST DAYS OF THE SOUTHERN MARCH</h3>
<p><b>THE</b> events of the southern journey were recorded day by
day in the diary I wrote during the long march. I read this diary
when we had got back to civilisation, and arrived at the
conclusion that to rewrite it would be to take away the special
flavour which it possesses. It was written under conditions of
much difficulty, and often of great stress, and these conditions
I believe it reflects. I am therefore publishing the diary with
only such minor amendments to the phraseology as were necessary
in order to make it easily understood. The reader will understand
that when one is writing in a sleeping-bag, with the temperature
very low and food rather short, a good proportion of the "of's,"
"and's" and "the's" get left out. The story will probably seem
bald, but it is at any rate a faithful record of what occurred. I
will deal more fully with some aspects of the journey in a later
chapter. The altitudes given in the diary were calculated at the
time, and were not always accurate. The corrected altitudes are
given on the map and in a table at the end of the book. The
distances were calculated by means of a sledge-meter, checked by
observations of the sun, and are approximately accurate.</p>

<br>
<small>97. THE CAMP AT HUT POINT</small></p>
<p><i>October</i> 29, 1908. A glorious day for our start;
brilliant sunshine and a cloudless sky, a fair wind from the
north, in fact, everything that could conduce to an auspicious
beginning. We had breakfast at 7 a.m., and at 8.30 the sledges
that the motor was to haul to Glacier Tongue were taken down by
the penguin rookery and over to the rough ice. At 9.30 a.m. the
supporting-party started and was soon out of sight, as the motor
was running well. At 10 a.m. we four of the Southern Party
followed. As we left the hut where we had spent so many months in
comfort, we had a feeling of real regret that never again would
we all be together there. It was dark inside, the acetylene was
feeble in comparison with the sun outside, and it was small
compared to an ordinary dwelling, yet we were sad at leaving it.
Last night as we were sitting at dinner the evening sun entered
through the ventilator and a circle of light shone on the picture
of the Queen. Slowly it moved across and lit up the photograph of
his Majesty the King. This seemed an omen of good luck, for only
on that day and at that particular time could this have happened,
and to-day we started to strive to plant the Queen's flag on the
last spot of the world. At 10 a.m. we met Murray and Roberts, and
said good-bye, then went on our way. Both of these, who were to
be left, had done for me all that men could do in their own
particular line of work to try and make our little expedition a
success. A clasp of the hands means more than many words, and as
we turned to acknowledge their cheer and saw them standing on the
ice by the familiar cliffs, I felt that we must try to do well
for the sake of every one concerned in the expedition.</p>
<p>Hardly had we been going for an hour when Socks went dead
lame. This was a bad shock, for Quan had for a full week been the
same. We had thought that our troubles in this direction were
over. Socks must have hurt himself on some of the sharp ice. We
had to go on, and I trust that in a few days he will be all
right. I shall not start from our depot at Hut Point until he is
better or until I know actually what is going to happen. The
lameness of a pony in our present situation is a serious thing.
If we had eight, or even six, we could adjust matters more
easily, but when we are working to the bare ounce it is very
serious.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. we halted and fed the ponies. As we sat close to
them on the sledge Grisi suddenly lashed out, and striking the
sledge with his hoof, struck Adams just below the knee. Three
inches higher and the blow would have shattered his kneecap and
ended his chance of going on. As it was the bone was almost
exposed, and he was in great pain, but said little about it. We
went on and at 2.30 p.m. arrived at the sledges which had gone on
by motor yesterday, just as the car came along after having
dragged the other sledges within a quarter of a mile of the
Tongue. I took on one sledge, and Day started in rather soft snow
with the other sledges, the car being helped by the supporting
party in the worst places. Pressure ridges and drift just off the
Tongue prevented the car going further, so I gave the sledge Quan
was dragging to Adams, who was leading Chinaman, and went back
for the other. We said good-bye to Day, and he went back, with
Priestley and Brocklehurst helping him, for his foot was still
very weak.</p>
<p>We got to the south side of Glacier Tongue at 4 p.m., and
after a cup of tea started to grind up the maize in the depot. It
was hard work, but we each took turns at the crusher, and by 8
p.m. had ground sufficient maize for the journey. It is now 11
p.m., and a high warm sun is shining down, the day calm and
clear. We had hoosh at 9 p.m. Adams' leg is very stiff and sore.
The horses are fairly quiet, but Quan has begun his old tricks
and is biting his tether. I must send for wire rope if this goes
on.</p>
<p>At last we are out on the long trail, after four years'
thought and work. I pray that we may be successful, for my heart
has been so much in this.</p>
<p>There are numbers of seals lying close to our camp. They are
nearly all females, and will soon have young. Erebus is emitting
three distinct columns of steam to-day, and the fumaroles on the
old crater can be seen plainly. It is a mercy that Adams is
better to-night. I cannot imagine what he would have done if he
had been knocked out for the southern journey, his interest in
the expedition has been so intense. Temperature plus 2&deg; Fahr.,
distance for the day, 14&frac12; miles.</p>
<p>October 30. At Hut Point. Another gloriously fine day. We
started away for Hut Point at 10.30 a.m., leaving the
supporting-party to finish grinding the maize. The ponies were in
good fettle and went away well. Socks walking without a sledge,
while Grisi had 500 lb., Quan 430 lb., and Chinaman 340 lb. Socks
seems better to-day. It is a wonderful change to get up in the
morning and put on ski boots without any difficulty, and to
handle cooking vessels without "burning" one's fingers on the
frozen metal. I was glad to see all the ponies so well, for there
had been both wind and drift during the night. Quan seems to take
a delight in biting his tether when any one is looking, for I put
my head out of the tent occasionally during the night to see if
they were all right, and directly I did so Quan started to bite
his rope. At other times they were all quiet.</p>
<p>We crossed one crack that gave us a little trouble, and at
1.30 p.m. reached Castle Rock, travelling at one mile and
three-quarters per hour. There I changed my sledge, taking on
Marshall's sledge with Quan, for Grisi was making hard work of
it, the surface being very soft in places. Quan pulled 500 lb.
just as easily and at 3 p.m. we reached Hut Point, tethered the
ponies, and had tea. There was a slight north wind. At 5 p.m. the
supporting-party came up. We have decided to sleep in the hut,
but the supporting party are sleeping in the tent at the very
spot where the <i>Discovery</i> wintered six years ago. To-morrow
I am going back to the Tongue for the rest of the fodder. The
supporting-party elected to sleep out because it is warmer, but
we of the southern party will not have a solid roof over our
heads for some months to come, so will make the most of it. We
swept the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> out. Wild killed a seal for fresh meat
and washed the liver at the seal hole, so to-morrow we will have
a good feed. Half a tin of jam is a small thing for one man to
eat when he has a sledging appetite, and we are doing our share,
as when we start there will be no more of these luxuries. Adams'
leg is better, but stiff. Our march was nine and a half miles
to-day. It is now 10 p.m.</p>
<p><i>October</i> 31. This day started with a dull snowy
appearance, which soon developed into a snowstorm, but a mild one
with little drift. I wanted to cross to Glacier Tongue with Quan,
Grisi and Chinaman.</p>
<p>During the morning we readjusted our provision weights and
unpacked the bags. In the afternoon it cleared, and at 3.30 p.m.
we got under way, Quan pulling our sleeping equipment. We covered
the eight miles and a half to Glacier Tongue in three hours, and
as I found no message from the hut, nor the gear I had asked to
be sent down, I concluded it was blowing there also, and so
decided to walk on after dinner. I covered the twelve miles in
three hours, arriving at Cape Royds at 11.30, and had covered the
twenty-three miles between Hut Point and Cape Royds in six hours,
marching time. They were surprised to see me, and were glad to
hear that Adams and Socks were better. I turned in at 2 a.m. for
a few hours' sleep. It had been blowing hard with thick drift, so
the motor had not been able to start for Glacier Tongue. On my
way to Cape Royds I noticed several seals with young ones,
evidently just born. Murray tells me that the temperature has
been plus 22&deg; Fahr.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 1. Had breakfast at 6 a.m., and Murray came on
the car with me, Day driving. There was a fresh easterly wind. We
left Cape Royds at 8 a.m., and arrived off Inaccessible Island at
twenty minutes past eight, having covered a distance of eight
miles. The car was running very well. Then off Tent Island we
left the car, and hauled the sledge, with the wire rope, &amp;c.,
round to our camp off Glacier Tongue. Got under way at 10 a.m.,
and reached Hut Point at 2 p.m., the ponies pulling 500 and 550
lb. each. Grisi bolted with his sledge, but soon stopped. The
ponies pulled very well, with a bad light and a bad surface. We
arranged the packing of the sledges in the afternoon, but we are
held up because of Socks. His foot is seriously out of order. It
is almost a disaster, for we want every pound of hauling power.
This evening it is snowing hard, with no wind. Adams' leg is much
better. Wild noticed a seal giving birth to a pup. The baby
measured 3 ft. 10 in. in length, and weighed 50 lb. I turned in
early to-night, for I had done thirty-nine miles in the last
twenty-four hours.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 2. Dull and snowy during the early hours of
to-day. When we awoke we found that Quan had bitten through his
tether and played havoc with the maize and other fodder. Directly
he saw me coming down the ice-foot, he started off, dashing from
one sledge to another, tearing the bags to pieces and trampling
the food out. It was ten minutes before we caught him. Luckily,
one sledge of fodder was untouched. He pranced round, kicked up
his heels, and showed that it was a deliberate piece of
destructiveness on his part, for he had eaten his fill. His
distended appearance was obviously the result of many pounds of
maize.</p>
<p>In the afternoon three of the ponies hauled the sledges with
their full weights across the junction of the sea and the Barrier
ice, and in spite of the soft snow they pulled splendidly. We are
now all ready for a start the first thing to-morrow. Socks seems
much better, and not at all lame. The sun is now (9 p.m.) shining
gloriously, and the wind has dropped, all auguring for a fine day
to-morrow. The performance of the ponies was most satisfactory,
and if they will only continue so for a month, it will mean a lot
to us. Adams' leg is nearly all right.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 3. Started at 9.30 from Hut Point, Quan
pulling 660 lb., Grisi 615 lb., Socks 600 lb., and Chinaman 600
lb. Five men hauled 660 lb., 153 lb. of this being pony feed for
our party. It was a beautifully fine day, but we were not long
under way when we found that the surface was terribly soft, the
ponies at times sinking in up to their bellies and always over
their hocks.</p>
<p>We picked up the other sledges at the Barrier junction, and
Brocklehurst photographed us all, with our sledge-flags flying
and the Queen's Union Jack. At 10.50 we left the sea ice, and
instead of finding the Barrier surface better, discovered that
the snow was even softer than earlier in the day. The ponies
pulled magnificently, and the supporting-party toiled on
painfully in their wake. Every hour the pony leaders changed
places with the sledge haulers. A 1 p.m. the advance-party with
the ponies pitched camp and tethered out the ponies, and soon
lunch was under way, consisting of tea with plasmon, plasmon
biscuits and cheese. At 2.30 we struck camp, the supporting-party
with the man-sledge going on in advance, while the others with
the ponies did the camp work. By 4 p.m. the surface had improved
in places, so that the men did not break through the crust so
often, but it was just as hard work as ever for the ponies. The
weather kept beautifully fine, with a slight south-east wind. The
weather sides of the ponies were quite dry, but their lee sides
were frosted with congealed sweat. Whenever it came to our turn
to pull, we perspired freely. As the supporting-party are not
travelling as fast as the ponies, we have decided to take them on
only for two more days, and then we of the Southern Party will
carry the remainder of the pony feed from their sledge on our
backs. So to-morrow morning we will depot nearly 100 lb. of oil
and provisions, which will lighten the load on the
supporting-party's sledge a good deal.</p>

<br>
<small>98. THE START FROM THE ICE-EDGE SOUTH OF HUT
POINT</small></p>
<p>We camped at 6 p.m., and, after feeding the ponies, had our
dinner, consisting of pemmican, emergency ration, plasmon
biscuits and plasmon cocoa, followed by a smoke, the most ideal
smoke a man could wish for after a day's sledging. As there is
now plenty of biscuit to spare, we gave the gallant little ponies
a good feed of them after dinner. They are now comfortably
standing in the sun, with the temperature plus 14&deg; Fahr., and
occasionally pawing the snow. Grisi has dug a large hole already
in the soft surface. We have been steering a south-east course
all day, keeping well to the north of White Island to avoid the
crevasses. Our distance for the day is 12 miles (statute) 300
yards.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 4. Started at 8.30 this morning; fine weather,
but bad light. Temperature plus 9&deg; Fahr. We wore goggles, as
already we are feeling the trying light. The supporting-party
started first, and with an improved surface during the morning
they kept ahead of the ponies, who constantly broke through the
crust. As soon as we passed the end of White Island, the surface
became softer, and it was trying work for both men and ponies.
However, we did 9 miles 500 yards, statute, up to 1 p.m., the
supporting-party going the whole time without being relieved.
Their weights had been reduced by nearly 100 lb., as we depoted
that amount of oil and provisions last night. In the afternoon
the surface was still softer, and when we came to camp at 6 p.m.
the ponies were plainly tired. The march for the day was 16 miles
500 yards (statute), over fourteen miles geographical, with a bad
surface, so we have every reason to be pleased with the ponies.
The supporting-party pulled hard. The cloud rolled away from
Erebus this evening, and it is now warm, clear and bright to the
north, but dark to the south. I am steering about east-south-east
to avoid the crevasses off White Island, but to-morrow we go
south-east. We fixed our position to-night from bearings, and
find that we are thirty-four miles south of Cape Royds. Every one
is fit and well.</p>

<br>
<small>100. A CAMP AFTER A BLIZZARD, WITH THE SUPPORTING
PARTY</small></p>
<p><i>November</i> 5. On turning out this morning, we found the
weather overcast, with slight snow falling and only a few
landmarks visible to the north, nothing to the south. We got
under way at 8.15 a.m., steering by compass. The light was so bad
that the sastrugi could not be seen, though of the latter there
was not much, for there was a thick coating of fallen snow. The
surface was very bad for ponies and men. The ponies struggled
gamely on through the tiring morning, and we camped for lunch at
1 p.m., having done 8 miles 1200 yards. After lunch we started at
2.15 p.m. in driving snow, but our steering was very wild. We had
been making a south-east course all the morning, but in the
afternoon the course was a devious one. Suddenly Marshall, who
was leading Grisi, got his legs into a crevasse, and Grisi also;
they recovered themselves, and Marshall shouted out to me. I
stopped my horse and went to his assistance in getting the sledge
off the snow-bridge covering the chasm. The crevasse was about 3
ft. wide, with the sides widening out below. No bottom could be
seen. The line of direction was north-west by south-east. I at
once altered the course to east, but in about a quarter of an
hour Wild, Adams and Marshall got into a narrow crevasse, so I
stopped and pitched camp, to wait until the weather cleared and
we could get some idea of our actual position. This was at 3
p.m., the sledge meter recording 9 miles 1200 yards (statute) for
the day. At 4 p.m. it commenced to drift and blow, and it is
blowing hard and gustily now. It is very unfortunate to be held
up like this, but I trust that it will blow itself out to-night
and be fine to-morrow. The ponies will be none the worse for the
rest. We wore goggles to-day, as the light was so bad and some of
us got a touch of snow-blindness.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 6. Lying in our sleeping-bags all day except
when out feeding the ponies, for it has been blowing a blizzard,
with thick drift, from south by west. It is very trying to be
held up like this, for each day means the consumption of 40 lb.
of pony feed alone. We only had a couple of biscuits each for
lunch, for I can see that we must retrench at every setback if we
are going to have enough food to carry us through. We started
with ninety-one days' food, but with careful management we can
make it spin out to 110 days. If we have not done the job in that
time it is God's will. Some of the supporting-party did not turn
out for any meal during the last twenty-four hours. Quan and
Chinaman have gone their feeds constantly, but Socks and Grisi
not so well. They all like Maujee ration and eat that up before
touching the maize. They have been very quiet, standing tails to
the blizzard, which has been so thick that at times we could not
see them from the peep-holes of our tents. There are great drifts
all round the tents, and some of the sledges are buried. This
evening about 5.30 the weather cleared a bit and the wind
dropped. When getting out the feed-boxes at 6 p.m. I could see
White Island and the Bluff, so I hope that to-morrow will be
fine. The barometer has been steady all day at 28.60 in., with
the temperature up to 18&deg; Fahr., so it is quite warm, and in our
one-man sleeping-bags each of us has a little home, where he can
read and write and look at the penates and lares brought with
him. I read <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> during the morning. The
surface of the Barrier is better, for the wind has blown away a
great deal of the soft snow, and we will, I trust, be able to see
any crevasses before we are on to them. This is our fourth day
out from Hut Point, and we are only twenty miles south. We must
do better than this if we are to make much use of the ponies. I
would not mind the blizzard so much if we had only to consider
ourselves, for we can save on the food, whereas the ponies must
be fed full.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 7. Another disappointing day. We got up at 5
a.m. to breakfast, so as to be in time to start at 8 a.m. We
cleared all the drift off our sledges, and, unstowing them,
examined the runners, finding them to be in splendid condition.
This work, with the assistance of the supporting-party, took us
till 8.30 a.m. Shortly afterwards we got under way, saying
good-bye to the supporting-party, who are to return to-day. As we
drew away, the ponies pulling hard, they gave us three cheers.
The weather was thick and overcast, with no wind. Part of White
Island could be seen, and Observation Hill, astern, but before us
lay a dead white wall, with nothing, even in the shape of a
cloud, to guide our steering. Almost immediately after we left we
crossed a crevasse, and before we had gone half a mile we found
ourselves in a maze of them, only detecting their presence by the
ponies breaking through the crust and saving themselves, or the
man leading a pony putting his foot through. The first one
Marshall crossed with Grisi was 6 ft. wide, and when I looked
down, there was nothing to be seen but a black yawning void. Just
after this, I halted Quan on the side of one, as I thought in the
uncertain light, but I found that we were standing on the crust
in the centre, so I very gingerly unharnessed him from the sledge
and got him across. Then the sledge, with our three months'
provisions, was pulled out of danger. Following this, Adams
crossed another crevasse, and Chinaman got his fore-foot into the
hole at the side. I, following with Quan, also got into
difficulties, and so I decided that it was too risky to proceed,
and we camped between two large crevasses. We picketed the ponies
out and pitched one tent, to wait till the light became better,
for we were courting disaster by proceeding in that weather. Thus
ended our day's march of under a mile, for about 1 p.m. it
commenced to snow, and the wind sprang up from the south-west
with drift. We pitched our second tent and had lunch, consisting
of a pot of tea, some chocolate and two biscuits each. The
temperature was plus 12&deg; Fahr. at noon.</p>
<p>It blew a little in the afternoon, and I hope to find it clear
away this pall of dead white stratus that stops us. The ponies
were in splendid trim for pulling this morning, but, alas! we had
to stop. Grisi and Socks did not eat up their food well at lunch
or dinner. The temperature this evening is plus 9&deg; Fahr., and the
ponies feel chilly. Truly this work is one demanding the greatest
exercise of patience, for it is more than trying to have to sit
here and watch the time going by, knowing that each day lessens
our stock of food. The supporting-party got under way about 9.30
a.m., and we could see them dwindling to a speck in the north.
They will, no doubt, be at Hut Point in a couple of days. We are
now at last quite on our own resources, and as regards comfort in
the tents are very well off, for with only two men in each tent,
there is ample room. Adams is sharing one with me, whilst
Marshall and Wild have the other. Wild is cook this week, so they
keep the cooker and the primus lamp in their tent, and we go
across to meals, after first feeding the ponies. Next week Adams
will be cook, so the cooking will be done in the tent I am in. We
will also shift about so that we will take turns with each other
as tent-mates. On the days on which we are held up by weather we
read, and I can only trust that these days may not be many. I am
just finishing reading <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>. I have
Shakespeare's Comedies, Marshall has Borrow's "The Bible in
Spain", Adams has Arthur Young's "Travels in France", and Wild
has "Sketches by Boz". When we have finished we will change
round. Our allowance of tobacco is very limited, and on days like
these it disappears rapidly, for our anxious minds are relieved
somewhat by a smoke. In order to economise my cigarettes, which
are my luxury, I whittled out a holder from a bit of bamboo
to-day, and so get a longer smoke, and also avoid the paper
sticking to my lips, which have begun to crack already from the
hot metal pot and the cold air.</p>

<br>
<small>101. THE SOUTHERN PARTY MARCHING INTO THE WHITE
UNKNOWN</small></p>
<blockquote>Note. The difficulties of travelling over snow and
ice in a bad light are very great. When the light is diffused by
clouds or mist, it casts no shadows on the dead white surface,
which consequently appears to the eye to be uniformly level.
Often as we marched the sledges would be brought up all standing
by a sastrugus, or snow mound, caused by the wind, and we would
be lucky if we were not tripped up ourselves. Small depressions
would escape the eye altogether, and when we thought that we were
marching along on a level surface, we would suddenly step down
two or three feet. The strain on the eyes under these conditions
is very great, and it is when the sun is covered and the weather
is thickish that snow-blindness is produced. Snow-blindness, with
which we all became acquainted during the southern journey, is a
very painful complaint. The first sign of the approach of the
trouble is running at the nose; then the sufferer begins to see
double, and his vision gradually becomes blurred. The more
painful symptoms appear very soon. The blood vessels of the eyes
swell, making one feel as though sand had got in under the lids,
and then the eyes begin to water freely and gradually close up.
The best method of relief is to drop some cocaine into the eye,
and then apply a powerful astringent, such as sulphate of zinc,
in order to reduce the distended blood vessels. The only way to
guard against an attack is to wear goggles the whole time, so
that the eyes may not be exposed to the strain caused by the
reflection of the light from all quarters. These goggles are made
so that the violet rays are cut off, these rays being the most
dangerous, but in warm weather, when one is perspiring on account
of exertion with the sledges, the glasses fog, and it becomes
necessary to take them off frequently in order to wipe them. The
goggles we used combined red and green glasses, and so gave a
yellow tint to everything and greatly subdued the light. When we
removed them, the glare from the surrounding whiteness was
intense, and the only relief was to get inside one of the tents,
which were made of green material, very restful to the eyes. We
noticed that during the spring journey, when the temperature was
very low and the sun was glaring on us, we did not suffer from
snow-blindness. The glare of the light reflected from the snow on
bright days places a very severe strain on the eyes, for the rays
of the sun are flashed back from millions of crystals. The worst
days, as far as snow-blindness was concerned, were when the sun
was obscured, so that the light came equally from every
direction, and the temperature was comparatively
high.</blockquote>
<p><i>November</i> 8. Drawn blank again! In our bags all day,
while outside the snow is drifting hard and blowing freshly at
times. The temperature was plus 8&deg; Fahr. at noon. The wind has
not been really strong; if it had been I believe that this
weather would have been over sooner. It is a sore trial to one's
hopes and patience to lie and watch the drift on the tent-side,
and to know that our valuable pony food is going, and this
without benefiting the animals themselves. Indeed, Socks and
Grisi have not been eating well, and the hard maize does not
agree with them. At lunch we had only a couple of biscuits and
some chocolate, and used our oil to boil some Maujee ration for
the horses, so that they had a hot hoosh. They all ate it
readily, which is a comfort. This standing for four days in drift
with 24&deg; of frost is not good for them, and we are anxiously
looking for finer weather. To-night it is clearer, and we could
see the horizon and some of the crevasses. We seem to be in a
regular nest of them. The occupants of the other tent have
discovered that it is pitched on the edge of a previously unseen
one. We had a hot hoosh to-night, consisting of pemmican, with
emergency ration and the cocoa. This warmed us up, for to lie
from breakfast time at 6 a.m. for twelve or thirteen hours
without hot food in this temperature is chilly work. If only we
could get under way and put some good marches in, we would feel
more happy. It is 750 miles as the crow flies from our winter
quarters to the Pole, and we have done only fifty-one miles as
yet. But still the worst will turn to the best, I doubt not. That
a polar explorer needs a large stock of patience in his equipment
there is no denying. The sun is showing thin and pale through the
drift this evening, and the wind is more gusty, so we may have it
really fine to-morrow. I read some of Shakespeare's comedies
to-day.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 9. A different story to-day. When we woke up
at 4.30 a.m. it was fine, calm and clear, such a change from the
last four days. We got breakfast at 5 a.m., and then dug the
sledges out of the drift. After this we four walked out to find a
track amongst the crevasses, but unfortunately they could only be
detected by probing with our ice-axes, and these disclosed all
sorts, from narrow cracks to great ugly chasms with no bottom
visible. A lump of snow thrown down one would make no noise, so
the bottom must have been very far below. The general direction
was south-east and north-west, but some curved round to the south
and some to the east. There was nothing for it but to trust to
Providence, for we had to cross them somewhere. At 8.30 a.m. we
got under way, the ponies not pulling very well, for they have
lost condition in the blizzard and were stiff. We got over the
first few crevasses without difficulty, then all of a sudden
Chinaman went down a crack which ran parallel to our course.
Adams tried to pull him out and he struggled gamely, and when
Wild and I, who were next, left our sledges and hauled along
Chinaman's sledge, it gave him more scope, and he managed to get
on to the firm ice, only just in time, for three feet more and it
would have been all up with the southern journey. The three-foot
crack opened out into a great fathomless chasm, and down that
would have gone the horse, all our cooking gear and biscuits and
half the oil, and probably Adams as well. But when things seem
the worst they turn to the best, for that was the last crevasse
we encountered, and with a gradually improving surface, though
very soft at times, we made fair headway. We camped for lunch at
12.40 p.m., and the ponies ate fairly well. Quan is pulling 660
lb., and had over 700 lb. till lunch; Grisi has 590 lb., Chinaman
570 lb., and Socks 600 lb. In the afternoon the surface further
improved, and at 6 p.m. we camped, having done 14 miles 600
yards, statute. The Bluff is showing clear, and also Castle Rock
miraged up astern of us. White Island is also clear, but a
stratus cloud overhangs Erebus, Terror and Discovery. At 6.20
p.m. we suddenly heard a deep rumble, lasting about five seconds,
that made the air and the ice vibrate. It seemed to come from the
eastward, and resembled the sound and had the effect of heavy
guns firing. We conjecture that it was due to some large mass of
the Barrier breaking away, and the distance must be at least
fifty miles from where we are. It was startling, to say the least
of it. To-night we boiled some Maujee ration for the ponies, and
they took this feed well. It has a delicious smell, and we
ourselves would have enjoyed it. Quan is now engaged in the
pleasing occupation of gnawing his tether rope. I tethered him up
by the hind leg to prevent him attacking this particular thong,
but he has found out that by lifting his hind-leg he can reach
the rope, so I must get out and put a nose-bag on him. The
temperature is now plus 5&deg; Fahr., but it feels much warmer, for
there is a dead calm and the sun is shining.</p>
<blockquote>Note. On my return to the winter quarters I made
inquiries as to whether the rumbling sound we had heard had been
noticed at Cape Royds, but I found that no member of the party
there had remarked anything out of the ordinary. Probably Mounts
Erebus and Terror had intercepted the sound. There is no doubt
that the Barrier ice breaks away in very large masses. We had an
illustration of that fact in the complete disappearance of
Barrier Inlet, the spot at which I had proposed to place the
winter quarters. It is from the edge of the Barrier, not only in
our quadrant locality, but also on the other side of the
Antarctic area, that the huge tabular bergs found in the
Antarctic waters are calved off. Fractures develop as the ice is
influenced by the open water, and these fractures extend until
the breaking-point is reached. Then a berg, or perhaps a series
of bergs, is left free to float northwards. At the time when we
heard and felt the concussion of a break, we were some fifty
miles from the Barrier edge, so that the disturbance in the ice
must have been very extensive.</blockquote>

<h3>STEADY PROGRESS: THE SIGHTING OF NEW LAND</h3>
<p><b>NOVEMBER 10</b>. Got up to breakfast at 6 a.m., and under
way at 8.15 a.m. During the night we had to get out to the
ponies. Quan had eaten away the straps on his rug, and Grisi and
Socks were fighting over it. Quan had also chewed Chinaman's
tether, and the latter was busy at one of the sledges, chewing
rope. Happily he has not the same mischievous propensities as
Quan, so the food-bags were not torn about. All these things mean
work for us when the day's march is over, repairing the damage
done. The ponies started away well, with a good hard surface to
travel on, but a bad light, so we, being in finnesko, had
frequent falls over the sastrugi. I at last took my goggles off,
and am paying the penalty to-night, having a touch of
snow-blindness. During the morning the land to the west became
more distinct, and the going still better, so that when we camped
for lunch, we had covered nine and a half statute miles. All the
ponies, except Quan, showed the result of the Maujee ration, and
are quite loose. Directly we started after lunch, we came across
the track of an Adelie penguin. It was most surprising, and one
wonders how the bird came out here. It had evidently only passed
a short time before, as its tracks were quite fresh. It had been
travelling on its stomach a good way, and its course was due east
towards the sea, but where it had come from was a mystery, for
the nearest water in the direction from which it came was over
fifty miles away, and it had at least another fifty miles to do
before it could reach food and water. The surface in the
afternoon became appallingly soft, the ponies sinking in up to
their hocks, but there was hard snow underneath. At 6 p.m. we
camped, with a march for the day of 15 miles 1550 yards statute.
The sun came out in the afternoon, so we turned our sleeping-bags
inside out and dried them. To-day's temperature ranged from plus
3&deg; Fahr. in the morning to plus 12&deg; Fahr. at noon. At 8 p.m. it
was plus 5&deg; Fahr. There is now a light north wind, and I expect
Erebus will be clear soon; bearings and angles put us sixty miles
from our depot, where lies 167 lb. of pony food.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 11. It was 8.40 before we got under way this
morning, for during the night the temperature dropped well below
zero, and it was minus 12&deg; when we got up and found our finnesko
and all our gear frozen hard, just like spring sledging times. We
had to unpack the sledges and scrape the runners, for the sun had
melted the snow on the upper surfaces, and the water had run down
and frozen hard during the night on the under sides. The surface
was again terribly soft, but there were patches of hard sastrugi
beneath, and on one of these Quan must have stepped, for to our
great anxiety, he suddenly went lame about 11 a.m. I thought it
was just the balling of the snow on his feet, but on scraping
this off, he still was lame. Fortunately, however, he improved
greatly and was practically all right after lunch. During the
night, the snow always balls on the ponies' feet, and it is one
of our regular jobs to scrape it off, before we harness up in the
morning. The snow was not so thick on the surface in the
afternoon, only about 5 in., and we got on fairly well. The Bluff
is now sixteen miles to the north-west of us, and all the
well-known land is clear, Erebus sending out a huge volume of
steam, that streams away to the south-west right past Mount
Discovery, fifty miles from its crater. Again this afternoon we
passed an Adelie penguin track. The bird was making the same
course as the one we had passed before. At 6.30 p.m. we camped,
having done fifteen statute miles. After dinner we got bearings
which put us forty-seven miles from our depot. I do trust that
the weather will hold up till we reach it. It is cold to-night
writing, the temperature being minus 9&deg; Fahr. The land to the
south-south-west is beautifully clear.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 13. No diary yesterday, for I had a bad attack
of snow-blindness, and am only a bit better to-night. We did a
good march yesterday of over fifteen miles over fair surface, and
again to-day did fifteen miles, but the going was softer. The
ponies have been a trouble again. I found Quan and Chinaman
enjoying the former's rug. They have eaten all the lining. The
weather has been beautifully fine, but the temperature down to
12&deg; below zero. The others' eyes are all right. Wild, who has
been suffering, has been better to-day. Snow-blindness is a
particularly unpleasant thing. One begins by seeing double, then
the eyes feel full of grit; this makes them water and eventually
one cannot see at all. All yesterday afternoon, though I was
wearing goggles, the water kept running out of my eyes, and,
owing to the low temperature, it froze on my beard. However, the
weather is beautiful, and we are as happy as can be, with good
appetites, too good in fact for the amount of food we are
allowing ourselves. We are on short rations, but we will have
horse meat in addition when the ponies go under. We have saved
enough food to last us from our first depot into the Bluff,
where, on the way back, we will pick up another depot that is to
be laid out by Joyce during January next. I trust we will pick up
the depot to-morrow night and it will be a relief, for it is a
tiny speck in this snowy plain, and is nearly sixty miles from
the nearest land. It is much the same as picking up a buoy in the
North Sea with only distant mountains for bearings. We are now
clear of the pressure round the Bluff, and the travelling should
be good until we reach the depot. On the spring journey we got
into the crevasses off the Bluff, these crevasses being due to
the movement of the ice-sheet impinging against the long arm of
the Bluff reaching out to the eastward. Close in the pressure is
much more marked, the whole surface of the Barrier rising into
hillocks and splitting into chasms. When the summer sun plays on
these and the wind sweeps away the loose snow, a very slippery
surface is presented, and the greatest care has to be exercised
to prevent the sledges skidding into the pits, often over 100 ft.
deep. As one gets further away from the area of disturbance the
ridges flatten out, the pits disappear, and the crevasses become
cracks. We are now on to level going, clear of any dangers.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 14. Another beautiful day, but with a low
temperature (minus 7&deg; Fahr. at 6 p.m.). During the morning there
was a wind from the west-south-west, bitterly cold on our faces
and burst lips, but the sun was warm on our backs. The ponies
pulled well, and in spite of somewhat deep snow they got on very
well. We stopped at noon for bearings, and to get the sun's
altitude for latitude, and at lunch worked out our position. We
expected to see the depot to-night or to-morrow morning, but
during the afternoon, when we halted for a spell, we found that
our "ready use" tin of kerosene had dropped off a sledge, so
Adams ran back three miles and found it. This caused a delay, and
we camped at 6 p.m. We were just putting the position on the
chart after dinner when Wild, who was outside looking through the
Goertz glasses, shouted out that he could see the depot, and we
rushed out. There were the flag and sledge plainly to be seen
through the glasses. It is an immense relief to us, for there is
stored at the depot four days' pony feed and a gallon of oil. We
will sleep happily to-night. The Barrier surface now is covered
with huge sastrugi, rounded off and running west-south-west and
east-north-west, with soft snow between. We have never seen the
surface alike for two consecutive days. The Barrier is as wayward
and as changeful as the sea.</p>

<small>102. DEPOT A, LAID OUT IN THE SPRING</small></p>
<p><i>November</i> 15. Another beautiful day. We broke camp at 8
a.m., and reached our depot at 9.20 a.m. We found everything
intact, the flag waving merrily in the breeze, the direction of
which was about west-south-west. We camped there and at once
proceeded to redistribute weights and to parcel our provisions to
be left there. We found that we had saved enough food to allow
for three days' rations, which ought to take us into the Bluff on
our return, so we made up a bag of provisions and added a little
oil to the tin we had been using from, leaving half a gallon to
take us the fifty odd miles to the Bluff on the way back. We then
depoted our spare gear and finnesko, and our tin of sardines and
pot of black currant jam. We had intended these provisions for
Christmas Day, but the weight is too much; every ounce is of
importance. We took on the maize, and the ponies are now pulling
449 lb. each. Quan was pulling 469 lb. before the depot was
reached, so he had nothing added to his load. All this arranging
took time, and it was nearly noon before we were finished. We
took an observation for latitude and variation, and found the
latitude to be 79&deg; 36' South, and the variation 155&deg; East. Had
lunch at noon and started due south at 1.15 p.m., the ponies
pulling well. As the afternoon went on the surface of the Barrier
altered to thick, crusty snow, with long rounded sastrugi about 4
ft. high, almost looking like small undulations, running
south-west to north-west, with small sastrugi on top running west
and east. Camped at 6 p.m., having done 12 miles 1500 yards
(statute) to-day. There are some high, stratified, light clouds
in the sky, the first clouds we have had for nearly a week. The
sun now, at 9 p.m., is beautifully warm, though the air
temperature is minus 2&deg; Fahr. It is dead calm. We are going to
build a snow mound at each camp as a guide to our homeward track,
and as our camps will only be seven miles apart, these marks
ought to help us. The mystery of the Barrier grips us, and we
long to know what lies in the unknown to the south. This we may
do with good fortune in another fortnight.</p>
<blockquote>Note. I wrote that the provisions left at the depot
would suffice for three days, but as a matter of fact there was
not more than a two days' supply. We felt that we ought to take
on every ounce of food that we could, and that if we got back to
the depot we would be able to manage as far as the Bluff all
right. During the winter we had thought over the possibility of
making the mounds as a guide for the return march, and had
concluded that though they would entail extra work, we might be
well repaid if we picked up only one or two of them at critical
times. We had with us two shovels, and ten minutes' work was
sufficient to raise a mound 6 or 7 ft. high. We wondered whether
the mounds would disappear under the influence of wind and sun,
and our tracks remain, whether the tracks would disappear and the
mounds remain, whether both tracks and mounds would disappear, or
whether both would remain. As we were not keeping in towards the
land, but were making a bee-line for the south, it was advisable
to neglect no precaution, and as events turned out, the mounds
were most useful. They remained after the sledge tracks had
disappeared, and they were a very great comfort to us during the
journey back from our furthest south point.</blockquote>
<p><i>November</i> 16. We started again this morning in
gloriously fine weather, the temperature minus 15&deg; Fahr. (down to
minus 25&deg; Fahr. during the night). The ponies pulled splendidly.
All the western mountains stood up, miraged into the forms of
castles. Even the Bluff could be seen in the far distance,
changed into the semblance of a giant keep. Before starting,
which we did at 7.40 a.m., we made a mound of snow, 6 ft. high,
as a guide to us on our homeward way, and as it was built on a
large sastrugi, we saw it for two and a half statute miles after
starting. At twenty minutes to twelve, we halted for latitude
observations, and found that we had reached 79&deg; 50' South. After
lunch the surface changed somewhat, but the going was fairly
good, in fact we covered 17 miles 200 yards (statute), a record
day for us. This evening it is cloudy, high cumulus going from
south-east to north-west. The temperature to-night is minus 5&deg;
Fahr., but it being dead calm we feel quite warm. A hot sun
during the day dried our reindeer skin sleeping-bags, the water,
or rather ice, all drying out of them, so we sleep in dry bags
again. It has been a wonderful and successful week, so different
to this time six years ago, when I was toiling along five miles a
day over the same ground. To-night one can see the huge mountain
range to the south of Barne Inlet. In order to further economise
food we are saving three lumps of sugar each every day, so in
time we will have a fair stock. The great thing is to advance our
food-supply as far south as possible before the ponies give out.
Every one is in splendid health, eyes all right again, and only
minor troubles, such as split lips, which do not allow us to
laugh. Wild steered all day, and at every hourly halt I put the
compass down to make the course we are going straight as a die to
the south. Chinaman, or "The Vampire", as Adams calls him, is not
so fit; he is stiff in the knees and has to be hauled along.
Quan, <i>alias</i> "Blossom", is Al, but one cannot leave him for
a moment, otherwise he would have his harness chewed up. Within
the last week he has had the greater part of a horse-cloth, about
a fathom of rope, several pieces of leather, and odds and ends
such as a nose-bag buckle, but his digestion is marvellous, and
he seems to thrive on his strange diet. He would rather eat a
yard of creosoted rope than his maize and Maujee, indeed he
often, in sheer wantonness, throws his food all over the
snow.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 17. A dull day when we started at 9.50 a.m.,
but the mountains abeam were in sight till noon. The weather then
became completely overcast, and the light most difficult to steer
in; a dead white wall was what we seemed to be marching to, and
there was no direct light to cast even the faintest shadow on the
sastrugi. I steered from noon to 1 p.m., and from lunch till 6
p.m., but the course was most erratic, and we had to stop every
now and then to put the compass down to verify our course and
alter it if necessary. Our march for the day was 16 miles 200
yards (statute) through a bad surface, the ponies sinking in up
to their hocks. This soft surface is similar to that we
experienced last trip south, for the snow had a crust easily
broken through and about 6 in. down an air-space, then similar
crusts and air-spaces in layers. It was trying work for the
ponies, but they all did splendidly in their own particular way.
Old "Blossom" plods stolidly through it; Chinaman flounders
rather painfully, for he is old and stiff nowadays; Grisi and
Socks take the soft places with a rush; but all get through the
day's work and feed up at night, though Quan evinces disgust at
not having more Maujee ration and flings his maize out of his
nose-bag. One wonders each night what trouble they will get into.
This morning on turning out, we found Grisi lying down unable to
get up. He had got to the end of his tether, and could not draw
back his leg. He was shivering with cold, though the temperature
was only minus 5&deg;. To-day we had a plus temperature, for the
first time since leaving&mdash; plus 9&deg; Fahr. at noon, and plus
5&deg; Fahr. at 6 p.m. The pall of cloud no doubt acts as a blanket,
and so we were warm, too warm in fact for marching.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 18. Started at 8 a.m. in clearer weather, and
the sun remained visible all day, though during the morning it
was snowing from the south, and made the steering very difficult.
The surface has been simply awful. We seem to have arrived at a
latitude where there is no wind and the snow remains where it
falls, for we were sinking in well over our ankles, and the poor
ponies are having a most trying time. They break through the
crust on the surface and flounder up to their hocks, and at each
step they have to pull their feet out through the brittle crust.
It is telling more on Chinaman than on the others, and he is
going slowly. The chafing of the snow crust on his fetlocks has
galled them, so we will have to shoot him at the next depot in
about three days' time. The ponies are curious animals. We give
them full meals, and yet they prefer to gnaw at any odd bits of
rope. Quan got my jacket in his teeth this morning as I was
scraping the snow off his hind feet, and I had to get out last
night to stop Socks biting and swallowing lumps out of Quan's
tail. If we had thought that they would have been up to these
games, we would have had a longer wire to tether them, so as to
keep them apart. It is possible that we have reached the windless
area around the Pole, for the Barrier is a dead, smooth, white
plain, weird beyond description, and having no land in sight, we
feel such tiny specks in the immensity around us. Overhead this
afternoon, when the weather cleared, were wonderful lines of
clouds, radiating from the south-west, travelling very fast to
the north-east. It seems as though we were in some other world,
and yet the things that concern us most for the moment are
trivial, such as split lips and big appetites. Already the daily
meals seem all too short, and we wonder what it will be like
later on, when we are really hungry. I have had that experience
once, and my companions will soon have it again with me. All the
time we are moving south to our wished-for goal, and each day we
feel that another gain has been made. We did 15 miles 500 yards
to-day.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 19. Started at 8.15 this morning with a fresh
southerly breeze and drift. The temperature was plus 2&deg; Fahr.,
and this was the temperature all day, making it cold travelling,
but good for the ponies, who, poor beasts, had to plough through
a truly awful surface, sinking in 8 or 10 in. at every step. This
does not seem very deep, but when one goes on hour after hour it
is a strain on man and horse, for we have to hold the ponies up
as they stumble along. In spite of the surface and the wind and
drift, we covered 15 miles 200 yards (statute) by 6 p.m., and
were glad to camp, for our beards and faces were coated in ice,
and our helmets had frozen stiff on to our faces. We got sights
for latitude at noon, and found that we were in latitude 80&deg; 32'
South. On the last journey I was not in that latitude till
December 16, though we left Hut Point on November 2, a day
earlier than we did this time. The ponies have truly done well. I
wrote yesterday that we seemed to be in a windless area, but
to-day alters that opinion. The sastrugi are all pointing clearly
due south, and if we have the wind on our way back it will be a
great help. The same radiant points in the clouds south-east to
north-west were visible again to-day, and at times when it
cleared somewhat a regular nimbus cloud, similar to the rain
clouds in the "doldrums", could be seen. At the base of the
converging point of the south-east part of cloud there seemed to
rise other clouds to meet the main body. The former trended
directly from the horizon at an angle of 30&deg; to meet the main
body, and did not seem to be more than a few miles off. The drift
on the Barrier surface was piled up into heaps of very fine snow,
with the smallest grains, and on encountering these the sledges
ran heavily. The crust that has formed, when broken through,
discloses loose-grained snow, and the harder crust, about 8 in.
down, is almost even. I suppose that the top 8 in. represents the
year's snowfall.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 20. Started at 8.55 a.m. in dull, overcast
weather again, but the sun broke through during the morning, so
we had something to steer by. The surface has been the worst we
have encountered so far, terribly soft, but we did 15 miles 800
yards (statute) for the day. The latter part of the afternoon was
better. It seems to savour of repetition to write each day of the
heavy going and the soft surface, but these factors play a most
important part in our daily work, and it causes us a great deal
of speculation as to what we will eventually find as we get
further south. The whole place and conditions seem so strange and
so unlike anything else in the world in our experience, that one
cannot describe them in fitting words. At one moment one thinks
of Coleridge's "Ancient Mariner": "Alone, alone; all, all alone,
alone on a wide, wide sea", and then when the mazy clouds spring
silently from either hand and drift quickly across our zenith,
not followed by any wind, it seems uncanny. There comes a puff of
wind from the north, another from the south, and anon one from
the east or west, seeming to obey no law, acting on erratic
impulses. It is as though we were truly at the world's end, and
were bursting in on the birthplace of the clouds and the nesting
home of the four winds, and one has a feeling that we mortals are
being watched with a jealous eye by the forces of nature. To add
to these weird impressions that seem to grow on one in the
apparently limitless waste, the sun to-night was surrounded by
mock suns and in the zenith was a bow, turning away from the
great vertical circle around the sun. These circles and bows were
the colour of the rainbow. We are all fairly tired to-night, and
Wild is not feeling very fit, but a night's rest will do him
good. The ponies are all fit except poor old Chinaman, and he
must go to-morrow. He cannot keep up with the others, and the bad
surface has played him out. The temperature is zero Fahr.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 21. Started at 7.30 a.m. as we had to come to
camp early to-night, and we wanted to get a good latitude
observation at noon. Although we got away early, however, all
morning we were steering through thick weather with driving ice
crystals, and at noon there was no chance of getting the sun for
latitude. We came to camp at 12.30 p.m., just as the weather
cleared a little, and we could see land on our right hand, but
only the base of the mountains, so could not identify them.
Chinaman came up at last, struggling painfully along, so when we
made our depot this evening he was shot. We will use the meat to
keep us out longer, and will save on our dried stores. The
temperature at noon was only plus 8&deg; Fahr., and the little wind
that there was has been extremely cold. The wind veers round and
round the compass, and the clouds move in every direction. The
surface of the Barrier was better to-day, but still the ponies
sank in 8 in. at least. The sastrugi point towards the
south-east, this being the direction of the most usual wind here.
This evening it cleared, and we could see land almost ahead, and
the great mass of land abaft the beam to the north of Barne
Inlet. Our day's march was 15 miles 450 yards. We are now south
of the 81st parallel, and feel that we are well on the road to
our wished-for goal. This is now our second depot, and we intend
to leave about 80 lb. of pony meat, one tin of biscuits (27 lb.),
some sugar and one tin of oil to see us back to Depot A. It is
late now, for all arrangements for the depot took time. There was
a lot of work in the arranging of the sledges for the remaining
three ponies: packing stores, skinning Chinaman and cutting him
up, all in a low temperature.</p>
<blockquote>Note. The killing of the ponies was not pleasant
work, but we had the satisfaction of knowing that the animals had
been well fed and well treated up to the last, and that they
suffered no pain. When we had to kill a pony, we threw up a snow
mound to leeward of the camp, so that no smell of blood could
come down wind, and took the animal behind this, out of sight of
the others. As a matter of fact, the survivors never displayed
any interest at all in the proceedings, even the report of the
revolver used in the killing failing to attract their attention.
The sound did not travel far on the wide open plain. The revolver
was held about 3 in. from the forehead of the victim and one shot
was sufficient to cause instant death. The throat of the animal
was cut immediately and the blood allowed to run away. Then
Marshall and Wild would skin the carcase, and we took the meat
off the legs, shoulders and back. In the case of Chinaman the
carcase was opened and the liver and undercut secured, but the
job was such a lengthy one that we did not repeat it in the case
of the other animals. Within a very short time after killing the
carcase would be frozen solid, and we always tried to cut the
meat up into as small pieces as possible before this occurred,
for the cutting became very much more difficult after the process
of freezing was complete. On the following days, whenever there
was time to spare, we would proceed with the cutting until we had
got all the meat ready for cooking. It was some time before we
found out that it was better merely to warm the meat through when
we wanted to eat it, and not attempt to cook it properly. It was
fairly tender when only warmed, but if it were boiled it became
very tough, and we would not spare enough oil to stew it in order
to soften it thoroughly. Our supply of oil had been cut down very
fine in order to save weight. The only meat that we cooked
thoroughly was that from Grisi, because we found, at a later
stage of the journey, that this meat was not good, and we thought
that cooking might make it less liable to cause attacks of
dysentery. We used the harness from the dead pony to make stays
for the sledge which would be left at the depot. The sledge was
reared on to its end, about 3 ft. being sunk into the snow, and a
bamboo with a black flag stuck on the top, so that we might be
able to find the little "cache" of food on the return journey.
Stays were required lest a blizzard should blow down the whole
erection.</blockquote>
<p><i>November</i> 22. A beautiful morning. We left our depot
with its black flag flying on the bamboo lashed to a discarded
sledge, stuck upright in the snow, at 8.20 a.m. We have now three
ponies dragging 500 lb. each, and they did splendidly through the
soft snow. The going, I am thankful to say, is getting better,
and here and there patches of harder surface are to be met with.
The outstanding feature of to-day's march is that we have seen
new land to the south&mdash;land never seen by human eyes before.
The land consists of great snow-clad heights rising beyond Mount
Longstaff, and also far inland to the north of Mounts Markham.
These heights we did not see on our journey south on the last
expedition, for we were too close to the land or, rather,
foothills, but now at the great distance we are out they can be
seen plainly. It has been a beautifully clear day, and all the
well-known mountains are clearly visible. The coast trends about
south by east, so that we are safe for a good long way south. We
camped at noon and got a good meridian altitude and azimuth. We
found our latitude to be 81&deg; 8' South. In the afternoon we
steered a little to the east of south, and camped at 6 p.m. with
15 miles 250 yards (statute) to the credit of the day. This is
good, for the ponies have a heavy load, but they are well fed. We
were rather long at lunch camp, for we tried to pull out Adams'
tooth, which has given him great pain, so much that he has not
slept at night at all. But the tooth broke, and he has a bad time
now. We were not equipped on this trip for tooth-pulling. Wild is
better to-day, but fatty food is not to his taste just now, so he
had a good feed of horseflesh. We all liked it, for it filled us
well, in spite of being somewhat tough. The flavour was good and
it means a great saving of our other food. The temperature has
risen to plus 7&deg; Fahr., and the surface of the Barrier is good
for sledge-hauling.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 23. Our record march to-day, the distance
being 17 miles 1650 yards statute. It has been a splendid day for
marching, with a cool breeze from the south and the sun slightly
hidden. The horses did very well indeed, and the surface has
improved, there being fairly hard sastrugi from the south. We are
gradually rising the splendid peaks of Longstaff and Markham. The
former, from our present bearing, has several sharp peaks, and
the land fades away in the far distance to the south, with
numbers of peaks showing, quite new to human eyes. All the old
familiar mountains, towards which I toiled so painfully last time
I was here, are visible, and what a difference it is now!
To-night there is a fresh wind from what appears at this distance
to be a strait between Longstaff and Markham, and a low drift is
flying along. Wild is better to-night, but he was tired after the
long march. We made him a cup of our emergency Oxo for lunch, and
that bucked him up for the afternoon. He has not eaten much
lately, but says that he feels decidedly better to-night.
Marshall has just succeeded in pulling out Adams' tooth, so now
the latter will be able to enjoy horse-meat. This evening we had
it fried, and so saved all our other food except biscuits and
cocoa. It is my week as cook now, and Wild is my tent
companion.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 24. Started this morning at 7.55, and made a
good march of 10 miles 600 yards (statute) up to 1 p.m., when we
camped for lunch. We marched from 2.30 to 6 p.m., and camped then
for the night. When we started there was a searching breeze in
our faces, which gradually increased during the day with low
drift, and it was blowing a summer blizzard when we camped this
evening, the temperature up to plus 17&deg; Fahr., and the drift
melting in the tent and on all our gear. The ponies did
splendidly again, in spite of soft surface, our day's run being
17 miles 680 yards statute. The Barrier surface is still as level
as a billiard table, with no sign of any undulation or rise; but
if the Barrier shows no sign of change it is otherwise with the
mountains. Each mile shows us new land, and most of it consists
of lofty mountains, whose heights at present we cannot estimate.
They are well over 10,000 ft. The great advantage of being out
from the coast is now obvious, for we can see a long range of
sharp-peaked mountains running to the westward from Mounts
Markham, and forming the south side of Shackleton Inlet on the
east side of Mounts Markham, and other peaks and one table-topped
mountain standing away to the south between Longstaff and
Markham. There appears to be a wide strait or inlet between
Longstaff and the new land east of Markham. Then trending about
south-east from Longstaff is a lofty range of mountains which we
will see more closely as we move south. I trust that the blizzard
will blow itself out to-night, so that we may have easy going
to-morrow. Wild is much better to-day, and went his ordinary
food. We had fried pony for dinner to-night, and raw pony frozen
on the march. The going is very good, but we can only afford a
little oil to cook up the meat for meals.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 25. Started at 8 a.m. this morning in fairly
good weather. The wind has gone during the night, leaving our
tents drifted up with fine snow. The land was obscured nearly all
day, but towards the evening it cleared and we could see the
details of the coast. There appears to be a series of inlets and
capes opening at all angles, and with no fixed coastline, though
the lofty range of mountains continues to the south with a very
slight trend to the eastward. The surface of the Barrier was very
trying to-day, for the snow had no consistency and slipped away
as one trod on it. It was not so trying for the ponies, and they
did 17 miles 1600 yards. We had frozen raw pony meat to eat on
the march, and a good hoosh of pony meat and pemmican for dinner.
Wild is practically all right, and Adams finds a wisdom tooth
growing in place of the one he lost. Our eyes are not too
comfortable just now. It is a wonderful place we are in, all new
to the world, and yet I feel that I cannot describe it. There is
an impression of limitless solitude about it all that makes us
feel so small as we trudge along, a few dark specks on the snowy
plain, and watch the new land appear.</p>

<br>
<h3>BEYOND ALL FORMER FOOTSTEPS</h3>
<p><b>NOVEMBER 26</b>. A day to remember, for we have passed the
"farthest South" previously reached by man. To-night we are in
latitude 82&deg; 18&frac12;' South, longitude 168&deg; East, and this latitude
we have been able to reach in much less time than on the last
long march with Captain Scott, when we made latitude 82&deg; 16&frac12;' our
"farthest South." We started in lovely weather this morning, with
the temperature plus 19&deg; Fahr., and it has been up to plus 20&deg;
Fahr. during the day, giving us a chance to dry our
sleeping-bags. We were rather anxious at starting about Quan, who
had a sharp attack of colic, the result no doubt of his morbid
craving for bits of rope and other odds and ends in preference to
his proper food. He soon got well enough to pull, and we got away
at 7.40 a.m., the surface still very soft. There are abundant
signs that the wind blows strongly from the south-south-east
during the winter, for the sastrugi are very marked in that
direction. There are extremely large circular crystals of snow on
the Barrier surface, and they seem hard and brittle. They catch
the light from the sun, each one forming a reflector that dazzles
the eyes as one glances at the million points of light. As each
hour went on to-day, we found new interest to the west, where the
land lies, for we opened out Shackleton Inlet, and up the inlet
lies a great chain of mountains, and far in to the west appear
more peaks; to the west of Cape Wilson appears another chain of
sharp peaks about 10,000 ft. high, stretching away to the north
beyond the Snow Cape, and continuing the land on which Mount A.
Markham lies. To the south-south-east ever appear new mountains.
I trust that no land will block our path. We celebrated the
breaking of the "farthest South" record with a four-ounce bottle
of Cura&ccedil;ao, sent us by a friend at home. After this had been
shared out into two tablespoonfuls each, we had a smoke and a
talk before turning in. One wonders what the next month will
bring forth. We ought by that time to be near our goal, all being
well.</p>

<br>
<small>103. THE CAMP AFTER PASSING THE PREVIOUS "FARTHEST SOUTH"
LATITUDE&mdash;NEW LAND IS SEEN IN THE BACKGROUND</small></p>
<blockquote>Note. It falls to the lot of few men to view land not
previously seen by human eyes, and it was with feelings of keen
curiosity, not unmingled with awe, that we watched the new
mountains rise from the great unknown that lay ahead of us.
Mighty peaks they were, the eternal snows at their bases, and
their rough-hewn forms rising high towards the sky. No man of us
could tell what we would discover in our march south, what
wonders might not be revealed to us, and our imaginations would
take wings until a stumble in the snow, the sharp pangs of
hunger, or the dull ache of physical weariness brought back our
attention to the needs of the immediate present. As the days wore
on, and mountain after mountain came into view, grimly majestic,
the consciousness of our insignificance seemed to grow upon us.
We were but tiny black specks crawling slowly and painfully
across the white plain, and bending our puny strength to the task
of wresting from nature secrets preserved inviolate through all
the ages. Our anxiety to learn what lay beyond was none the less
keen, however, and the long days of marching over the Barrier
surface were saved from monotony by the continued appearance of
new land to the south-east.</blockquote>
<p><i>November</i> 27. Started at 8 a.m., the ponies pulling well
over a bad surface of very soft snow. The weather is fine and
clear save for a strong mirage, which throws ail the land up much
higher than it really is. All day we have seen new mountains
arise, and it is causing us some anxiety to note that they trend
more and more to the eastward, for that means an alteration of
our course from nearly due south. Still they are a long way off,
and when we get up to them we may find some strait that will
enable us to go right through them and on south. One speculates
greatly as we march along, but patience is what is needed. I
think that the ponies are feeling the day-in, day-out drudgery of
pulling on this plain. Poor beasts, they cannot understand, of
course, what it is all for, and the wonder of the great mountains
is nought to them, though one notices them at times looking at
the distant land. At lunchtime I took a photograph of our camp,
with Mount Longstaff in the background. We had our sledge flags
up to celebrate the breaking of the southern record. The long
snow cape marked on the chart as being attached to Mount
Longstaff is not really so. It is attached to a lower bluff
mountain to the north of Mount Longstaff. The most northerly peak
of Mount Longstaff goes sheer down into the Barrier, and all
along this range of mountains are very steep glaciers, greatly
crevassed. As we pass along the mountains the capes disappear,
but there are several well-marked ones of which we have taken
angles. Still more mountains appeared above the horizon during
the afternoon, and when we camped to-night some were quite
clearly defined, many, many miles away. The temperature has been
up to plus 22&deg; Fahr. to-day, and we took the opportunity of
drying our sleeping-bags, which we turned inside out and laid on
the sledges. To-night the temperature is plus 13&deg; Fahr. We find
that raw frozen pony meat cools one on the march, and during the
ten minutes' spell after an hour's march we all cut up meat for
lunch or dinner; in the hot sun it thaws well. This fresh meat
ought to keep away scurvy from us. Quan seems much better to-day,
but Grisi does not appear fit at all. He seems to be snow-blind.
Our distance to-day was 16 miles 1200 yards.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 28. Started at 7.50 a.m. in beautiful weather,
but with a truly awful surface, the ponies sinking in very
deeply. The sledges ran easily, as the temperature was high, plus
17&deg; to plus 20&deg; Fahr., the hot sun making the snow surface almost
melt. We halted at noon for a latitude observation, and found our
latitude to be 82&deg; 38' South. The land now appears more to the
east, bearing south-east by south, and some very high mountains a
long way off, with lower foothills, can be seen in front, quite
different to the land abeam of us, which consists of huge
sharp-pointed mountains with crevassed glaciers moving down
gullies in their sides. Marshall is making a careful survey of
all the principal heights. All day we have been travelling up and
down long undulations, the width from crest to crest being about
one and a half miles, and the rise about 1 in 100. We can easily
see the line by our tracks sometimes being cut off sharp when we
are on the down gradient and appearing again a long way astern as
we rise. The first indication of the undulation was the fact of
the mound we had made in the morning disappearing before we had
travelled a quarter of a mile. During the afternoon the weather
was very hot. A cool breeze had helped us in the forenoon, but it
died away later. Marshall has a touch of snow-blindness, and both
Grisi and Socks were also affected during the day. When we camped
to-night Grisi was shot. He had fallen off during the last few
days, and the snow-blindness was bad for him, putting him off his
feed. He was the one chosen to go at the depot we made this
evening. This is Depot C, and we are leaving one week's
provisions and oil, with horse-meat, to carry us back to Depot B.
We will go on to-morrow with 1200 lb. weight (nine weeks'
provisions), and we four will pull with the ponies, two on each
sledge. It is late now, 11 p.m., and we have just turned in. We
get up at 5.30 a.m. every morning. Our march for the day was 15
miles 1500 yards statute.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 29. Started at 8.45 a.m. with adjusted loads
of 630 lb. on each sledge. We harnessed up ourselves, but found
that the ponies would not pull when we did, and as the loads came
away lightly, we untoggled our harness. The surface was very
soft, but during the morning there were occasional patches of
hard sastrugi, all pointing south-south-east. This is the course
we are now steering, as the land is trending about south-east by
east. During the day still more great mountains appeared to the
south-east, and to the west we opened up several huge peaks,
10,000 to 15,000 ft. in height. The whole country seems to be
made up of range after range of mountains, one behind the other.
The worst feature of to-day's march was the terribly soft snow in
the hollows of the great undulations we were passing. During the
afternoon one place was so bad that the ponies sank in right up
to their bellies, and we had to pull with might and main to get
the sledges along at all. When we began to ascend the rise on the
southern side of the undulation it got better. The ponies were
played out by 5.45 p.m., especially old Quan, who nearly
collapsed, not from the weight of the sledge, but from the effort
of lifting his feet and limbs through the soft snow. The weather
is calm and clear, but very hot, and it is trying to man and
beast. We are on a short allowance of food, for we must save all
we can, so as to help the advance as far as possible. Marshall
has taken the angles of the new land to-day. He does this
regularly. The hypsometer readings at 1 p.m. are very high now if
there is no correction, and it is not due to weather. We must be
at about sea-level. The undulations run about east by south, and
west by west, and are at the moment a puzzle to us. I cannot
think that the feeding of the glaciers from the adjacent
mountains has anything to do with their existence. There are
several glaciers, but their size is inconsiderable compared to
the vast extent of Barrier affected. The glaciers are greatly
crevassed. There are enormous granite cliffs at the foot of the
range we are passing, and they stand vertically about 4000 to
6000 ft. without a vestige of snow upon them. The main bare rocks
appear to be like the schists of the western mountains opposite
our winter quarters, but we are too far away, of course, to be
able to tell with any certainty. Down to the south are mountains
entirely clear of snow, for their sides are vertical, and they
must be not less than 8000 or 9000 ft. in height. Altogether it
is a weird and wonderful country. The only familiar thing is the
broad expanse of Barrier to the east, where as yet no land
appears. We did 14 miles 900 yards (statute) to-day, and are
tired. The snow came well above our ankles, and each step became
a labour. Still we are making our way south, and each mile gained
reduces the unknown. We have now done over 300 miles due south in
less than a month.</p>

<small>104. GRISI DEPOT, LATITUDE 82&deg; 45" SOUTH</small></p>
<p><i>November</i> 30. We started at 8 a.m. this morning. Quan
very shaky and seemingly on his last legs, poor beast. Both he
and Socks are snow-blind, so we have improvised shades for their
eyes, which we trust will help them a little. We took turns of an
hour each hauling at Quan's sledge, one at each side, to help
him. Socks, being faster, always gets ahead and then has a short
spell, which eases him considerably. We advanced very slowly
to-day, for the surface was as bad as ever till the afternoon,
and the total distance covered was 12 miles 150 yards. Quan was
quite played out, so we camped at 5.45 p.m. We give the ponies
ample food, but they do not eat it all, though Quan whinnies for
his every meal-time. He is particularly fond of the Maujee
ration, and neglects his maize for it. Again to-day we saw new
land to the south, and unfortunately for our quick progress in
that direction, we find the trend of the coast more to the
eastward. A time is coming, I can see, when we will have to
ascend the mountains, for the land runs round more and more in an
easterly direction. Still after all we must not expect to find
things cut and dried and all suited to us in such a place. We
will be thankful if we can keep the ponies as far as our next
depot, which will be in latitude 84&deg; South. They are at the
present moment lying down in the warm sun. It is a beautifully
calm, clear evening; indeed as regards weather we have been
wonderfully fortunate, and it has given Marshall the chance to
take all the necessary angles for the survey of these new
mountains and coastline. Wild is cook this week, and my week is
over, so I am now living in the other tent. We are all fit and
well, but our appetites are increasing at an alarming rate. We
noticed this to-night after the heavy pulling to-day. A great
deal of the land we are passing seems to consist of granite in
huge masses, and here and there are much crevassed glaciers,
pouring down between the mountains, perhaps from some inland
ice-sheet similar to that in the north of Victoria Land. The
mountains show great similarity in outline, and there is no sign
of any volcanic action at all so far. The temperature for the day
has ranged between plus 16&deg; and plus 12&deg; Fahr., but the hot sun
has made things appear much warmer.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 1. Started at 8 a.m. to-day. Quan has been
growing weaker each hour, and we practically pulled the sledge.
We passed over three undulations, and camped at 1 p.m. In the
afternoon we only did four miles, Quan being led by Wild. He also
led Socks with one sledge, whilst Adams, Marshall and I hauled
200 lb. each on the other sledge over a terribly soft surface.
Poor old Quan was quite finished when we came to camp at 6 p.m.,
having done 12 miles 200 yards, so he was shot. We all felt
losing him, I particularly, for he was my special horse ever
since he was ill last March. I had looked after him, and in spite
of all his annoying tricks he was a general favourite. He seemed
so intelligent. Still it was best for him to go, and like the
others he was well fed to the last. We have now only one pony
left, and are in latitude 83&deg; 16' South. Ahead of us we can see
the land stretching away to the east, with a long white line in
front of it that looks Uke a giant Barrier, and nearer a very
crusted-up appearance, as though there were great pressure ridges
in front of us. It seems as though the Barrier end had come, and
that there is now going to be a change in some gigantic way in
keeping with the vastness of the whole place. We fervently trust
that we will not be delayed in our march south. We are living
mainly on horse-meat now, and on the march, to cool our throats
when pulling in the hot sun, we chew some raw frozen meat. There
was a slight breeze for a time to-day, and we felt chilly, as we
were pulling stripped to our shirts. We wear our goggles all the
time, for the glare from the snow surface is intense and the sky
is cloudless. A few wisps of fleecy cloud settle on the tops of
the loftiest mountains, but that is all. The surface of the
Barrier still sparkles with the million frozen crystals which
stand apart from the ordinary surface snow. One or two new peaks
came in sight to-day, so we are ever adding to the chain of
wonderful mountains that we have found. At one moment our
thoughts are on the grandeur of the scene, the next on what we
would have to eat if only we were let loose in a good restaurant.
We are very hungry these days, and we know that we are likely to
be for another three months. One of the granite cliffs we are
nearing is over 6000 ft. sheer, and much bare rock is showing,
which must have running water on it as the hot sun plays down.
The moon was visible in the sky all day and it was something
familiar, yet far removed from these days of hot sunshine and
wide white pathways. The temperature is now plus 16&deg; Fahr., and
it is quite warm in the tent.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 2. Started at 8 a.m., all four of us hauling
one sledge, and Socks following behind with the other. He soon
got into our regular pace, and did very well indeed. The surface
during the morning was extremely bad and it was heavy work for
us. The sun beat down on our heads and we perspired freely,
though we were working only in shirts and pyjama trousers, whilst
our feet were cold in the snow. We halted for lunch at 1 p.m.,
and had some of Quan cooked, but he was very tough meat, poor old
beast. Socks, the only pony left now, is lonely. He whinnied all
night for his lost companion. At 1 p.m. to-day we had got close
enough to the disturbance ahead of us to see that it consisted of
enormous pressure ridges, heavily crevassed and running a long
way east, with not the slightest chance of our being able to get
southing that way any longer on the Barrier. So after lunch we
struck due south in toward the land, which is now running in a
south-east direction, and at 6 p.m. we were close to the ridges
off the coast. There is a red hill about 3000 ft. in height,
which we hope to ascend to-morrow, so as to gain a view of the
surrounding country. Then we will make our way, if possible, with
the pony up a glacier ahead of us on to the land ice, and on to
the Pole if all goes well. It is an anxious thing for us, for
time is precious and food more so; we will be greatly relieved if
we find a good route through the mountains. Now that we are close
to the land we can see more clearly the nature of the mountains.
From Mount Longstaff in a south-east direction, the land appears
to be far more glaciated than further north, and since the
valleys are very steep, the glaciers that they contain are
heavily crevassed. These glaciers bear out in a north-east
direction into the Barrier. Immediately opposite our camp the
snow seems to have been blown off the steep mountain sides. The
mountain ahead of us, which we are going to climb to-morrow, is
undoubtedly granite, but very much weathered. In the distance it
looked like volcanic rock, but now there can be no doubt that it
consists of granite. Evidently the great ice sheet has passed
over this part of the land, for the rounded forms could not have
been caused by ordinary weathering. Enormous pressure ridges that
run out from the south of the mountain ahead must be due to a
glacier far greater in extent than any we have yet met. The
glacier that comes out of Shackleton Inlet makes a disturbance in
the Barrier ice, but not nearly as great as the disturbance in
our immediate neighbourhood at the present time. The glacier at
Shackleton Inlet is quite a short one. We have now closed in to
the land, but before we did so we could see the rounded tops of
great mountains extending in a south-easterly direction. If we
are fortunate enough to reach the summit of the mountain
to-morrow, we should be able to see more clearly the line of
these mountains to the south-east. It would be very interesting
to follow along the Barrier to the south-east, and see the trend
of the mountains, but that does not enter into our programme. Our
way lies to the south. How one wishes for time and unlimited
provisions! Then indeed we could penetrate the secrets of this
great lonely continent. Regrets are vain, however, and we wonder
what is in store for us beyond the mountains if we are able to
get there. The closer observation of these mountains ought to
give geological results of importance. We may have the good
fortune to discover fossils, or at any rate to bring back
specimens that will determine the geological history of the
country and prove a connection between the granite boulders lying
on the slopes of Erebus and Terror and the land lying to the far
south. Our position to-night is latitude 83&deg; 28' South, longitude
171&deg; 30' East. If we can get on the mountain to-morrow it will be
the pioneer landing in the far south. We travelled 11 miles 1450
yards (statute) to-day, which was not bad, seeing that we were
pulling 180 lb. per man on a bad surface. We got a photograph of
the wonderful red granite peaks close to us, for now we are only
eight miles or so off the land. The temperature is plus 20&deg;, with
a high barometer. The same fine weather continues, but the wind
is cold in the early morning, when we turn out at 5.30 a.m. for
breakfast.</p>

<small>105. NEW LAND. THE PARTY ASCENDED MOUNT HOPE AND SIGHTED
THE GREAT GLACIER, UP WHICH THEY MARCHED THROUGH THE GAP. THE
MAIN BODY OF THE GLACIER JOINS THE BARRIER FARTHER TO THE
LEFT</small></p>
<p><i>December</i> 4. Unable to write yesterday owing to bad
attack of snow-blindness, and not much better to-night, but I
must record the events of the two most remarkable days that we
have experienced since leaving the winter quarters. After
breakfast at 5.30 a.m. yesterday, we started off from camp,
leaving all camp gear standing and a good feed by Socks to last
him the whole day. We got under way at 9 a.m., taking four
biscuits, four lumps of sugar and two ounces of chocolate each
for lunch. We hoped to get water at the first of the rocks when
we landed. Hardly had we gone one hundred yards when we came to a
crevasse, which we did not see very distinctly, for the light was
bad, and the sun obscured by clouds. We roped up and went on in
single file, each with his ice-pick handy. I found it very
difficult to see clearly with my goggles, and so took them off,
and the present attack of snow-blindness is the result, for the
sun came out gloriously later on. We crossed several crevasses
filled with snow except at the sides, the gaps being about 2 ft.
wide, and the whole crevasses from 10 to 20 ft. across. Then we
were brought up all standing by an enormous chasm of about 80 ft.
wide and 300 ft. deep which lay right across our route. This
chasm was similar to, only larger than the one we encountered in
latitude 80&deg; 30' South when on the southern journey with Captain
Scott during the <i>Discovery</i> expedition. By making a
<i>d&eacute;tour</i> to the right we found that it gradually pinched out
and became filled with snow, and so were able to cross and resume
our line to the land, which very deceptively appeared quite close
but was really some miles away.</p>
<p>Crossing several ridges of ice-pressure and many more
crevasses, we eventually at 12.30 p.m. reached an area of smooth
blue ice in which were embedded several granite boulders, and
here we obtained a drink of delicious water formed by the sun
playing on the rock face and heating the ice at the base. After
travelling for half a mile, we reached the base of the mountain
which we hoped to climb in order to gain a view of the
surrounding country. This hill is composed of granite, the red
appearance being no doubt due to iron. At 1 p.m. we had a couple
of biscuits and some water, and then started to make our way up
the precipitous rock face. This was the most difficult part of
the whole climb, for the granite was weathered and split in every
direction, and some of the larger pieces seemed to be just nicely
balanced on smaller pieces, so that one could almost push them
over by a touch. With great difficulty we clambered up this rock
face, and then ascended a gentle snow slope to another rocky bit,
but not so difficult to climb. From the top of this ridge there
burst upon our view an open road to the south, for there
stretched before us a great glacier running almost south and
north between two huge mountain ranges. As far as we could see,
except towards the mouth, the glacier appeared to be smooth, yet
this was not a certainty, for the distance was so great. Eagerly
we clambered up the remaining ridges and over a snow-slope, and
found ourselves at the top of the mountain, the height being 3350
ft. according to aneroid and hypsometer. From the summit we could
see the glacier stretching away south inland till at last it
seemed to merge in high inland ice. Where the glacier fell into
the Barrier about north-east bearing, the pressure waves were
enormous, and for miles the surface of the Barrier was broken up.
This was what we had seen ahead of us the last few days, and we
now understood the reason of the commotion on the Barrier
surface. To the south-east we could see the lofty range of
mountains we had been following still stretching away in the same
direction, and we can safely say that the Barrier is bounded by a
chain of mountains extending in a south-easterly direction as far
as the 86th parallel South. The mountains to the west appear to
be more heavily glaciated than the ones to the eastward. There
are some huge granite faces on the southern sides of the
mountains, and these faces are joined up by cliffs of a very dark
hue. To the south-south-east, towards what is apparently the head
of the glacier, there are several sharp cones of very black rock,
eight or nine in all. Beyond these are red granite faces, with
sharp, needle-like spurs, similar in appearance to the
"cathedral" rocks described by Armitage in connection with the
<i>Discovery</i> expedition to the western mountains. Further on
to the south the mountains have a bluff appearance, with long
lines of stratification running almost horizontally. This bluff
mountain range seems to break about sixty miles away, and beyond
can be seen dimly other mountains. Turning to the west, the
mountains on that side appeared to be rounded and covered with
huge masses of ice, and glaciers showing the lines of crevasses.
In the far distance there is what looked like an active volcano.
There is a big mountain with a cloud on the top, bearing all the
appearance of steam from an active cone. It would be very
interesting to find an active volcano so far south. After taking
bearings of the trend of the mountains, Barrier and glacier, we
ate our frugal lunch and wished for more, and then descended.
Adams had boiled the hypsometer and taken the temperature on the
top, whilst Marshall, who had carried the camera on his back all
the way up, took a couple of photographs. How we wished we had
more plates to spare to get a record of the wonderful country we
were passing through. At 4 p.m. we began to descend, and at 5
p.m. we were on the Barrier again. We were rather tired and very
hungry when, at 7 p.m., we reached our camp. After a good dinner,
and a cupful of Maujee ration in the hoosh as an extra, we turned
in.</p>

SOUTH. DEPOT D, ON LOWER GLACIER DEPOT, WAS UNDER THE ROCK,
CASTING A LONG SHADOW TO THE RIGHT. THE MOUNTAIN CALLED "THE
CLOUDMAKER" IS SEEN IN THE CENTRE ON THE HORIZON</small></p>
<p>To-day, December 4, we got under way at 8 a.m. and steered
into the land, for we could see that there was no question as to
the way we should go now. Though on the glacier, we might
encounter crevasses and difficulties not to be met with on the
Barrier, yet on the latter we could get no further than 86&deg;
South, and then would have to turn in towards the land and get
over the mountains to reach the Pole. We felt that our main
difficulty on the glacier route would be with the pony Socks, and
we could not expect to drag the full load ourselves as yet
without relay work. Adams, Marshall and I pulled one sledge with
680 lb. weight, and Wild followed with Socks directly in our
wake, so that if we came to a crevasse he would have warning.
Everything went on well except that when we were close in to
land, Marshall went through the snow covering of a crevasse. He
managed to hold himself up by his arms. We could see no bottom to
this crevasse. At 1 p.m. we were close to the snow-slope up which
we hoped to reach the interior of the land and thence get on to
the glacier. We had lunch and then proceeded, finding, instead of
a steep, short slope, a long, fairly steep gradient. All the
afternoon we toiled at the sledge. Socks pulling his load easily
enough, and eventually, at 5 p.m., reached the head of the pass,
2000 ft. above sea-level. From that point there was a gentle
descent towards the glacier, and at 6 p.m. we camped close to
some blue ice with granite boulders embedded in it, round which
were pools of water. This water saves a certain amount of our
oil, for we have not to melt snow or ice. We turned in at 8 p.m.,
well satisfied with the day's work. The weather now is
wonderfully fine, with not a breath of wind, and a warm sun
beating down on us. The temperature was up to plus 22&deg; Fahr. at
noon, and is now plus 18&deg; Fahr. The pass through which we have
come is flanked by great granite pillars at least 2000 ft. in
height and making a magnificent entrance to the "Highway to the
South". It is all so interesting and everything is on such a vast
scale that one cannot describe it well. We four are seeing these
great designs and the play of nature in her grandest moods for
the first time, and possibly they may never be seen by man again.
Poor Marshall had another four miles' walk this evening, for he
found that he had lost his Jaeger jacket off the sledge. He had
therefore to tramp back uphill for it, and found it two miles
away on the trail. Socks is not feeding well. He seems lonely
without his companions. We gave him a drink of thaw water this
evening, but he did not seem to appreciate it, preferring the
snow at his feet.</p>

<br>
<h3>ON THE GREAT GLACIER</h3>
<p><b>DECEMBER 5</b>. Broke camp sharp at 8 a.m. and proceeded
south down an icy slope to the main glacier. The ice was too
slippery for the pony, so Wild took him by a circuitous route to
the bottom on snow. At the end of our ice slope, down which the
sledge skidded rapidly, though we had put on rope brakes and hung
on to it as well as we could, there was a patch of soft snow
running parallel with the glacier, which here trended about
south-west by south. Close ahead of us were the massed-up,
fantastically shaped and split masses of pressure across which it
would have been impossible for us to have gone, but, fortunately,
it was not necessary even to try, for close into the land was a
snow slope free from all crevasses, and along this gentle rise we
made our way. After a time, this snow slope gave place to blue
ice, with numberless cracks and small crevasses across which it
was quite impossible for the pony to drag the sledge without a
serious risk of a broken leg in one of the many holes, the depth
of which we could not ascertain. We therefore unharnessed Socks,
and Wild took him over this bit of ground very carefully, whilst
we others first hauled our sledge and then the pony sledge across
to a patch of snow under some gigantic granite pillars over 2000
ft. in height, and here, close to some thaw water, we made our
lunch camp. I was still badly snow-blind, so stayed in camp
whilst Marshall and Adams went on to spy out a good route to
follow after lunch was over. When they returned they informed me
that there was more cracked-up blue ice ahead, and that the main
pressure of the glacier came in very close to the pillar of
granite that stood before us, but that beyond that there appeared
to be a snow slope and good going. The most remarkable thing they
reported was that as they were walking along a bird, brown in
colour with a white line under each wing, flew just over their
heads and disappeared to the south. It is, indeed, strange to
hear of such an incident in latitude 83&deg; 40' South. They were
sure it was not a skua gull, which is the only bird I could think
of that would venture down here, and the gull might have been
attracted by the last dead pony, for when in latitude 80&deg; 30'
South, on my last southern trip, a skua gull arrived shortly
after we had killed a dog.</p>
<p>After lunch we started again, and by dint of great exertions
managed, at 6 p.m., to camp after getting both sledges and then
the pony over another couple of miles of crevassed blue ice. We
then went on and had a look ahead, and saw that we are going to
have a tough time to-morrow to get along at all. I can see that
it will, at least, mean relaying three or four times across
nearly half a mile of terribly crevassed ice, covered in places
with treacherous snow, and razor-edged in other places, all of it
sloping down towards the rock <i>d&eacute;bris</i> strewn shore on the
cliff side. We are camped under a wonderful pillar of granite
that has been rounded by the winds into a perfectly symmetrical
shape, and is banded by lines of gneiss. There is just one little
patch of snow for our tents, and even that bridges some
crevasses. Providence will look over us to-night, for we can do
nothing more One feels that at any moment some great piece of
rock may come hurtling down, for all round us are pieces of
granite, ranging from the size of a hazelnut to great boulders
twenty to forty tons in weight, and on one snow slope is the
fresh track of a fallen rock. Still we can do no better, for it
is impossible to spread a tent on the blue ice, and we cannot get
any further to-night. We are leaving a depot here. My eyes are my
only trouble, for their condition makes it impossible for me to
pick out the route or do much more than pull. The distance
covered to-day was 9 miles with 4 miles relay. December 6.
Started at 8 a.m. to-day in fine weather to get our loads over
the half-mile of crevassed ice that lay between us and the snow
slope to the south-south-west. We divided up the load and managed
to get the whole lot over in three journeys, but it was an awful
job, for every step was a venture, and I, with one eye entirely
blocked up because of snow-blindness, felt it particularly
uncomfortable work. However, by 1 p.m. all our gear was safely
over, and the other three went back for Socks. Wild led him, and
by 2 p.m. we were all camped on the snow again. Providence has
indeed looked after us. At 3 p.m. we started south-south-west up
a long slope to the right of the main glacier pressure. It was
very heavy going, and we camped at 5 p.m. close to a huge
crevasse, the snow bridge of which we crossed. There is a
wonderful view of the mountains, with new peaks and ranges to the
south-east, south and south-west. There is a dark rock running in
conjunction with the granite on several of the mountains. We are
now over 1700 ft. up on the glacier, and can see down on to the
Barrier. The cloud still hangs on the mountain ahead of us; it
certainly looks as though it were a volcano cloud, but it may be
due to condensation. The lower current clouds are travelling very
fast from south-south-east to north-north-west. The weather is
fine and clear, and the temperature plus 17&deg; Fahr.</p>

<small>107. PART OF QUEEN ALEXANDRA RANGE, 1500 FEET UP THE
GLACIER</small></p>
<p><i>December</i> 7. Started at 8 a.m., Adams, Marshall and self
pulling one sledge. Wild leading Socks behind. We travelled up
and down slopes with very deep snow, into which Socks sank up to
his belly, and we plunged in and out continuously, making it very
trying work. Passed several crevasses on our right hand and could
see more to the left. The light became bad at 1 p.m., when we
camped for lunch, and it was hard to see the crevasses, as most
were more or less snow covered. After lunch the light was better,
and as we marched along we were congratulating ourselves upon it
when suddenly we heard a shout of "help" from Wild. We stopped at
once and rushed to his assistance, and saw the pony sledge with
the forward end down a crevasse and Wild reaching out from the
side of the gulf grasping the sledge. No sign of the pony. We
soon got up to Wild, and he scrambled out of the dangerous
position, but poor Socks had gone. Wild had a miraculous escape.
He was following up our tracks, and we had passed over a crevasse
which was entirely covered with snow, but the weight of the pony
broke through the snow crust and in a second all was over. Wild
says he just felt a sort of rushing wind, the leading rope was
snatched from his hand, and he put out his arms and just caught
the further edge of the chasm. Fortunately for Wild and us.
Socks' weight snapped the swingle-tree of the sledge, so it was
saved, though the upper bearer is broken. We lay down on our
stomachs and looked over into the gulf, but no sound or sign came
to us; a black bottomless pit it seemed to be. We hitched the
pony sledge to ourselves and started off again, now with a weight
of 1000 lb. for the four of us. Camped at 6.20 p.m., very tired,
having to retreat from a maze of crevasses and rotten ice on to a
patch where we could pitch our tents. We are indeed thankful for
Wild's escape. When I think over the events of the day I realise
what the loss of the sledge would have meant to us. We would have
had left only two sleeping-bags for the four of us, and I doubt
whether we could have got back to winter quarters with the short
equipment. Our chance of reaching the Pole would have been gone.
We take on the maize to eat ourselves. There is one ray of light
in this bad day, and that is that anyhow we could not have taken
Socks on much further. We would have had to shoot him to-night,
so that although his loss is a serious matter to us, for we had
counted on the meat, still we know that for traction purposes he
would have been of little further use. When we tried to camp
to-night we stuck our ice-axes into the snow to see whether there
were any more hidden crevasses, and everywhere the axes went
through. It would have been folly to have pitched our camp in
that place, as we might easily have dropped through during the
night. We had to retreat a quarter of a mile to pitch the tent.
It was very unpleasant to turn back, even for this short
distance, but on this job one must expect reverses.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 8. Started at 8 a.m. and immediately began
dodging crevasses and pits of unknown depth. Wild and I were
leading, for, thank heaven, my eyes are fit and well again. We
slowly toiled up a long crevassed slope, and by lunch time were
about 1900 ft. up the glacier and had covered 6 miles 150 yards
of an uphill drag, with about 250 lb. per man to haul. After
lunch we still travelled up, but came on to blue glacier ice
almost free from crevasses, so did much better, the sledges
running easily. We camped at 6 p.m., the day's journey having
been 12 miles 150 yards. The slope we went up in the morning was
not as bad as we had anticipated, but quite bad enough for us to
be thankful that we are out, at any rate for a time, from the
region of hidden crevasses. The hypsometer to-night gave our
height as 2300 ft. above sea-level. It is beautifully fine still.
We have been wonderfully fortunate in this, especially in view of
the situation we are in.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 9. Another splendid day as far as the weather
is concerned, and much we needed it, for we have had one of our
hardest day's work and certainly the most dangerous so far. We
started at 7.45 a.m. over the blue ice, and in less than an hour
were in a perfect maze of crevasses, some thinly bridged with
snow and others with a thicker and therefore more deceptive
covering. Marshall went through one and was only saved by his
harness. He had quite disappeared down below the level of the
ice, and it was one of those crevasses that open out from the
top, with no bottom to be seen, and I daresay there was a drop of
at least 1000 ft. Soon after, Adams went through, then I did. The
situation became momentarily more dangerous and uncertain. The
sledges, skidding about, came up against the sheer, knife-like
edges of some of the crevasses, and thus the bow of the second
sledge, which had been strained when Socks fell, gave way. We
decided to relay our gear over this portion of the glacier until
we got on to safer ground, and it was well past eleven o'clock
before we had got both sledges on to better ice. We camped at
11.45 a.m. to get the sun's meridian altitude, and, to save time
while watching the sun's rise and fall, decided to lunch at noon.
The latitude we found to be 84&deg; 2' South, which is not so bad
considering that we have been hauling our heavy load of 250 lb.
per man uphill for the last two days. At noon we were nearly 2500
ft. above sea-level. In the afternoon we had another heavy pull,
and now are camped between two huge crevasses, but on a patch of
hard snow. We pitched camp at 6 p.m., very tired and extremely
hungry after dragging uphill all the afternoon for over five
hours. It is 8 p.m. now, and we are nearly 3000 ft. above
sea-level. Low cumulus clouds are hanging to the south of us, as
they have done for many days past, obscuring any view in that
direction. We are anxiously hoping to find soon a level and
inland ice-sheet so that we can put on more speed. The distance
to-day was 11 miles 1450 yards plus two miles relay. The talk now
is mainly about food and the things we would like to eat, and at
mealtimes our hoosh disappears with far too great speed. We are
all looking forward to Christmas Day, for then, come what may, we
are going to be full of food.</p>

<br>
<small>108. THE CAMP BELOW "THE CLOUDMAKER"</small></p>
<p><i>December</i> 10. Falls, bruises, cut shins, crevasses,
razor-edged ice, and a heavy upward pull have made up the sum of
the day's trials, but there has been a measure of compensation in
the wonderful scenery, the marvellous rocks and the covering of a
distance of 11 miles 860 yards towards our goal. We started at
7.30 a.m. amongst crevasses, but soon got out of them and pulled
up a long slope of snow. Our altitude at noon was 3250 ft. above
sea-level. Then we slid down a blue ice slope, after crossing
crevasses. Marshall and I each went down one. We lunched at 1
p.m. and started at 2 p.m. up a long ridge by the side moraine of
the glacier. It was heavy work, as the ice was split and
presented knife-like edges between the cracks, and there were
also some crevasses. Adams got into one. The going was terribly
heavy, as the sledges brought up against the ice-edges every now
and then, and then there was a struggle to get them started
again. We changed our foot-gear, substituting ski-boots for the
finnesko, but nevertheless had many painful falls on the
treacherous blue ice, cutting our hands and shins. We are all
much bruised. We camped on a patch of snow by the land at 6 p.m.
The rocks of the moraine are remarkable, being of every hue and
description. I cannot describe them, but we will carry specimens
back for the geologists to deal with. The main rocks of the
"Cloudmaker", the mountain under which we are camped, appear to
be slates, reef quartz and a very hard, dark brown rock, the name
of which I do not know. The erratics of marble, conglomerate and
breccia are beautiful, showing a great mass of wonderful colours,
but these rocks we cannot take away. We can only take with us
small specimens of the main rocks, as weight is of importance to
us, and from these small specimens the geologists must determine
the general character of the land. This mountain is the one we
thought might be an active volcano when we saw it from the
mountain at the foot of the glacier, but the cloud has blown away
from its head to-day, and we can see definitely that it is not a
volcano. It is a remarkable sight as it towers above us with the
snow clinging to its sides. To-night there is a cold north wind.
I climbed about 600 ft. up the mountain and got specimens of the
main rocks <i>in situ</i>. The glacier is evidently moving very
slowly and not filling as much of the valley as it did at some
previous date, for the old moraines lie higher up in terraces.
Low cumulus clouds to the south are hiding some of the new land
in that direction. We are all very hungry and tired to-night
after the day's fight with glacier. Whilst I went up the mountain
to spy out the land the others ground up the balance of the
maize, brought for pony feed, between flat stones, in order that
we may use it ourselves to eke out our supply of food. The method
of preparation was primitive, but it represented the only way of
getting it fit to cook without the necessity of using more oil
than we can spare for lengthy boiling. The temperature was plus
12&deg; Fahr. at noon to-day, and is plus 14&deg; now at 8 p.m. We are
getting south, and we hope to reach the inland ice in a couple of
days; then our marching will be faster. The weather is still
fine.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 11. A heavy day. We started away at 7.40 a.m.
and tried to keep alongside the land, but the ice of the glacier
sloped so much that we had to go on to the ridge, where the
sledges could run without side-slipping. This slipping cuts the
runners very badly. We crossed the medial moraine, and found rock
there with what looked like plant impressions. We collected some
specimens.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we found the surface better, as the cracks
were nearly all filled up with water turned to ice. We camped for
lunch on rubbly ice. After lunch we rounded some pressure ridges
fairly easily, and then pulled up a long ice-slope with many
sharp points. All the afternoon we were passing over ice in which
the cracks had been closed up, and we began to have great hopes
that the end of the glacier was in sight, and that we would soon
be able to put in some good marches on the plateau. At 5 p.m. we
found more cracks and a mass of pressure ice ahead, and land
appeared as the clouds ahead lifted. I cannot tell what it means,
but the position makes us anxious. The sledges will not stand
much more of this ice work, and we are still 340 geographical
miles away from the Pole. Thank God the weather is fine still. We
camped at 6 p.m. on hard ice between two crevasses. There was no
snow to pack round the tents, so we had to put the sledges and
the provision bags on the snow cloths. We made the floor level
inside by chipping away the points of ice with our ice-axes. We
were very hungry after hoosh to-night. An awkward feature about
the glacier are the little pits filled with mud, of which I
collected a small sample.* It seems to be ground-down rock
material, but what the action has been I cannot tell. The hot
sun, beating down on this mud, makes it gradually sink into the
body of the glacier, leaving a rotten ice covering through which
we often break. It is like walking over a cucumber frame, and
sometimes the boulders that have sunk down through the ice can be
seen 3 or 4 ft. below the surface. The ice that has formed above
the sunken rocks is more clear than the ordinary glacier ice. We
are 8700 ft. up, and made 8 miles 900 yards to the good to-day.
We have the satisfaction of feeling that we are getting south,
and perhaps to-morrow may see the end of all our difficulties.
Difficulties are just things to overcome after all. Every one is
very fit.</p>
<p class="foot">[* These pits are known as "cryoconite
holes".]</p>
<p><i>December</i> 12. Our distance&mdash;three miles for the
day&mdash;expresses more readily than I can write it the nature
of the day's work. We started at 7.40 a.m. on the worst surface
possible, sharp-edged blue ice full of chasms and crevasses,
rising to hills and descending into gullies; in fact, a surface
that could not be equalled in any polar work for difficulty in
travelling. Our sledges are suffering greatly, and it is a
constant strain on us both to save the sledges from breaking or
going down crevasses, and to save ourselves as well. We are a
mass of bruises where we have fallen on the sharp ice, but, thank
God, no one has even a sprain. It has been relay work to-day, for
we could only take on one sledge at a time, two of us taking
turns at pulling the sledge whilst the others steadied and held
the sledge to keep it straight. Thus we would advance one mile,
and then return over the crevasses and haul up the other sledge.
By repeating this to-day for three miles we marched nine miles
over a surface where many times a slip meant death. Still we have
advanced three miles to the south, and to-night we are camped on
a patch of n&eacute;v&eacute;. By using our ice-axes we made a place for the
tent. The weather is still splendidly fine, though low clouds
obscure our horizon to the south. We are anxiously hoping to
cross the main pressure to-morrow, and trust that we will then
have better travelling. Given good travelling, we will not be
long in reaching our goal. Marshall is putting in the bearings
and angles of the new mountains. They still keep appearing to the
west and east. Distance 3 miles 500 yards, with relays 9 miles
1500 yards.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 13. We made a start at 8 a.m. and once again
went up hill and down dale, over crevasses and blue, ribbed ice,
relaying the sledges. We had covered about a mile when we came to
a place where it seemed almost impossible to proceed. However, to
our right, bearing about south-west by south, there seemed to be
better surface and we decided to make a <i>d&eacute;tour</i> in that
direction in order, if possible, to get round the pressure. While
returning for one of the sledges I fell on the ice and hurt my
left knee, which was a serious matter, or rather might have been.
I have had a bandage on all the afternoon while pulling, and the
knee feels better now, but one realises what it would mean if any
member of our party were to be damaged under these conditions and
in this place. This afternoon we came on to a better surface, and
were able to pull both sledges instead of relaying. We are still
gradually rising, and to-night our hypsometer gives 203.7, or
4370 feet up. There is a cool southerly wind; indeed, more than
we have had before, and as we have only a patch of n&eacute;v&eacute; on the
glacier for our tents, we had to take the provision bags and gear
off the sledges to keep the tent cloths down. The temperature is
plus 19&deg; Fahr. New mountains are still appearing to the
west-south-west as we rise. We seem now to be going up a long
yellow track, for the ice is not so blue, and we are evidently
travelling over an old moraine, where the stones have sunk
through the ice when its onward movement has been retarded. I am
sure that the bulk of the glacier is growing less, but the onward
movement still continues, though at a much slower pace than at
some previous period. The gain for the day was five miles, and in
addition we did four miles relay work.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 14. This has been one of our hardest day's
work so far. We have been steering all day about south-south-west
up the glacier, mainly in the bed of an ancient moraine, which is
full of holes through which the stones and boulders have melted
down long years ago. It has been snowing all day with a high
temperature, and this has made everything very wet. We have
ascended over 1000 ft. to-day, our altitude at 6 p.m. being 5600
ft. above sea-level, so the mountains to the west must be from
10,000 to 15,000 ft. in height, judging from their comparative
elevation. My knee is better to-day. We have had a heavy pull and
many falls on the slippery ice. Just before camping, Adams went
through some snow, but held up over an awful chasm. Our sledges
are much the worse for wear, and the one with the broken bow
constantly strikes against the hard, sharp ice, pulling us up
with a jerk and often flinging us down. At this high altitude the
heavy pulling is very trying, especially as we slip on the snow
covering the blue ice. There has evidently been an enormous
glaciation here, and now it is dwindling away. Even the mountains
show signs of this. To-night our hopes are high that we are
nearly at the end of the rise and that soon we will reach our
longed-for plateau. Then southward indeed! Food is the
determining factor with us. We did 7&frac12; miles to-day.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 15. Started at 7.40 a.m. in clear weather. It
was heavy going uphill on the blue ice, but gradually we rose the
land ahead, and it seemed as though at last we were going to have
a change, and that we would see something new. At lunchtime we
were on a better surface, with patches of snow, and we could see
stretching out in front of us what was apparently a long, wide
plain. It looked as though now really we were coming to the level
ground for which we have longed, especially as the hypsometer
gave us an altitude of 7230 ft., but this altitude at night came
down to 5830 ft., so the apparent height may be due to barometric
pressure and change of weather, for in the afternoon a stiff
breeze from the south-west sprang up. The temperature was plus
18&deg; Fahr. at noon, and when the wind came up it felt cold, as we
were pulling in our pyjama trousers, with nothing underneath. We
have been going steadily uphill all the afternoon, but on a
vastly improved surface, consisting of hard n&eacute;v&eacute; instead of blue
ice and no cracks, only covered-in crevasses, which are easily
seen. Ahead of us really lies the plateau. We can also see ahead
of us detached mountains, piercing through the inland ice, which
is the road to the south for us. Huge mountains stretch out to
the east and west. After last week's toil and anxiety the change
is delightful. The distance covered to-day was 13 miles 200
yards.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 16. We started at 7 a.m., having had breakfast
at 5.80 a.m. It was snowing slightly for the first few hours, and
then the weather cleared. The surface was hard and the going
good. We camped at noon and took sights for latitude, and
ascertained that our position was 84&deg; 50' South. Ahead of us we
could see a long slope, icy and crevassed, but we did 13 miles
1650 yards for the day. We camped at 5.30 p.m., and got ready our
depot gear. We have decided to travel as lightly as possible,
taking only the clothes we are wearing, and we will leave four
days' food, which I calculate should get us back to the last
depot on short ration. We have now traversed nearly one hundred
miles of crevassed ice, and risen 6000 ft. on the largest glacier
in the world. One more crevassed slope, and we will be on the
plateau, please God. We are all fit and well. The temperature
to-night is plus 15&deg; Fahr., and the wind is blowing freshly from
the south-west. There are splendid ranges of mountains to the
west-south-west, and we have an extended view of glacier and
mountains. Ahead of us lie three sharp peaks, connected up and
forming an island in what is apparently inland ice or the head of
the glacier. The peaks lie due south of us. To the eastward and
westward of this island the ice bears down from the inland
ice-sheet, and joins the head of the glacier proper. To the
westward the mountains along the side of the glacier are all of
the bluff type, and the lines of stratification can be seen
plainly. Still further to the westward, behind the frontal range,
lie sharper peaks, some of them almost perfect cones. The trend
of the land from the "Cloudmaker" is about south-south-west. We
are travelling up the west side of the glacier. On the other
side, to the east, there is a break in the bluff mountains, and
the land beyond runs away more to the south-east. The valley is
filled with pressure ice, which seems to have come from the
inland ice-sheet. The mountains to the south-east also show lines
of stratification. I hope that the photographs will be clear
enough to give an idea of the character of this land. These
mountains are not beautiful in the ordinary acceptance of the
term, but they are magnificent in their stern and rugged
grandeur. No foot has ever trod on their mighty sides, and until
we reached this frozen land no human eyes had seen their
forms.</p>

<small>110. THE MOUNTAINS TOWARDS THE HEAD OF THE GLACIER, WHERE
THE COAL WAS FOUND</small></p>
<p><i>December</i> 17. We made a start at 7.20 a.m. and had an
uphill pull all the morning over blue ice with patches of snow,
which impeded our progress until we learned that the best way was
to rush the sledges over them, for it was very difficult to keep
one's footing on the smooth ice, and haul the sledges astern over
the snow. By 1 p.m. we had done eight miles of this uphill work,
and in the afternoon we did four more. We had worked from 7.23
a.m. until 6.40 p.m. with one hour's rest for lunch only and it
seems as though twelve miles was not much, but the last two
hours' going was very stiff. We had to take on one sledge at a
time up the icy slope, and even then we had to cut steps with our
ice-axes as we went along. The work was made more difficult by
the fact that a strong southerly wind was dead in our faces. The
second sledge we hauled up the rise by means of the alpine rope.
We made it fast to the sledge, went on with the first sledge till
the rope was stretched out to its full length, then cut a place
to stand on, and by our united efforts hauled the sledge up to
where we stood. We repeated this until we had managed to reach a
fairly level spot with both the sledges, and we pitched our tents
on a small patch of snow. There was not enough of the snow to
make fast the snow-cloths of the tents, and we had to take the
gear off the sledges and pile that round to supplement the snow.
We have burned our boats behind us now as regards warm clothing,
for this afternoon we made a depot in by the rocks of the island
we are passing, and there left everything except the barest
necessaries. After dinner to-night Wild went up the hillside in
order to have a look at the plateau. He came down with the news
that the plateau is in sight at last, and that to-morrow should
see us at the end of our difficulties. He also brought down with
him some very interesting geological specimens, some of which
certainly look like coal. The quality may be poor, but I have
little doubt that the stuff is coal. If that proves to be the
case, the discovery will be most interesting to the scientific
world. Wild tells me that there are about six seams of this dark
stuff, mingled with sandstone, and that the seams are from 4 in.
to 7 or 8 ft. in thickness. There are vast quantities of it lying
on the hillside. We took a photograph of the sandstone, and I
wish very much that we could spare time to examine the rocks more
thoroughly. We may be able to do this on the way back. We have
but little time for geological work, for our way is south and
time is short, but we found that the main rock is sandstone and
on our way back we will collect some. I expect that this will be
the most southerly rock that we shall obtain, for we ought to
reach the plateau to-morrow, and then there will be no more land
close to us. It is gusty to-night, but beautifully clear. The
altitude, according to the hypsometer, is 6100 ft.</p>
<blockquote>Note. When I showed the specimens to Professor David
after our return to the <i>Nimrod</i>, he stated definitely that
some of them were coal and others "mother of coal". The notes on
geological matters in another chapter will deal more fully with
this very interesting discovery.</blockquote>

<h3>ON THE PLATEAU TO THE FARTHEST SOUTH</h3>
<p><b>DECEMBER 18</b>. Almost up! The altitude to-night is 7400
ft. above sea-level. This has been one of our hardest days, but
worth it, for we are just on the plateau at last. We started at
7.30 a.m., relaying the sledges, and did 6 miles 600 yards, which
means nearly 19 miles for the day of actual travelling. All the
morning we worked up loose, slippery ice, hauling the sledges up
one at a time by means of the alpine rope, then pulling in
harness on the less stiff rises. We camped for lunch at 12.45
p.m. on the crest of a rise close to the pressure and in the
midst of crevasses, into one of which I managed to fall, also
Adams. Whilst lunch was preparing I got some rock from the land,
quite different to the sandstone of yesterday. The mountains are
all different just here. The land on our left shows beautifully
clear stratified lines, and on the west side sandstone stands
out, greatly weathered. All the afternoon we relayed up a long
snow slope, and we were hungry and tired when we reached camp. We
have been saving food to make it spin out, and that increases our
hunger; each night we all dream of foods. We save two biscuits
per man per day, also pemmican and sugar, eking out our food with
pony maize, which we soak in water to make it less hard. All this
means that we have now five weeks' food, while we are about 300
geographical miles from the Pole, with the same distance back to
the last depot we left yesterday, so we must march on short food
to reach our goal. The temperature is plus 16&deg; Fahr. to-night,
but a cold wind all the morning cut our faces and broken lips. We
keep crevasses with us still, but I think that to-morrow will see
the end of this. When we passed the main slope to-day, more
mountains appeared to the west of south, some with sheer cliffs
and others rounded off, ending in long snow slopes. I judge the
southern limit of the mountains to the west to be about latitude
86&deg; South.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 19. Not on the plateau level yet, though we
are to-night 7888 ft. up, and still there is another rise ahead
of us. We got breakfast at 5 a.m. and started at 7 a.m. sharp,
taking on one sledge. Soon we got to the top of a ridge, and went
back for the second sledge, then hauled both together all the
rest of the day. The weight was about 200 lb. per man, and we
kept going until 6 p.m., with a stop of one hour for lunch. We
got a meridian altitude at noon, and found that our latitude was
85&deg; 5' South. We seem unable to get rid of the crevasses, and we
have been falling into them and steering through them all day in
the face of a cold southerly wind, with a temperature varying
from plus 15&deg; to plus 9&deg; Fahr. The work was very heavy, for we
were going uphill all day, and our sledge runners, which have
been suffering from the sharp ice and rough travelling, are in a
bad way. Soft snow in places greatly retarded our progress, but
we have covered our ten miles, and now are camped on good snow
between two crevasses. I really think that to-morrow will see us
on the plateau proper. This glacier must be one of the largest if
not the largest in the world. The sastrugi seem to point mainly
to the south, so we may expect head winds all the way to the
Pole. Marshall has a cold job to-night, taking the angles of the
new mountains to the west, some of which appeared to-day. After
dinner we examined the sledge runners and turned one sledge end
for end, for it had been badly torn while we were coming up the
glacier, and in the soft snow it clogged greatly. We are still
favoured with splendid weather, and that is a great comfort to
us, for it would be almost impossible under other conditions to
travel amongst these crevasses, which are caused by the
congestion of the ice between the headlands when it was flowing
from the plateau down between the mountains. Now there is
comparatively little movement, and many of the crevasses have
become snow-filled. To-night we are 290 geographical miles from
the Pole. We are thinking of our Christmas dinner. We will be
full that day, anyhow.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 20. Not yet up, but nearly so. We got away
from camp at 7 a.m., with a strong head wind from the south, and
this wind continued all day, with a temperature ranging from plus
7&deg; to plus 5&deg;. Our beards coated with ice. It was an uphill pull
all day around pressure ice, and we reached an altitude of over
8000 ft. above sea-level. The weather was clear, but there were
various clouds, which were noted by Adams. Marshall took bearings
and angles at noon, and we got the sun's meridian altitude,
showing that we were in latitude 85&deg; 17' South. We hope all the
time that each ridge we come to will be the last, but each time
another rises ahead, split up by pressure, and we begin the same
toil again. It is trying work and as we have now reduced our food
at breakfast to one pannikin of hoosh and one biscuit, by the
time the lunch hour has arrived, after five hours' hauling in the
cold wind up the slope, we are very hungry. At lunch we have a
little chocolate, tea with plasmon, a pannikin of cocoa and three
biscuits. To-day we did 11 miles 950 yards (statute) having to
relay the sledges over the last bit, for the ridge we were on was
so steep that we could not get the two sledges up together.
Still, we are getting on; we have only 279 more miles to go, and
then we will have reached the Pole. The land appears to run away
to the south-east now, and soon we will be just a speck on this
great inland waste of snow and ice. It is cold to-night. I am
cook for the week, and started to-night. Every one is fit and
well.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 21.&mdash;Midsummer Day, with 28&deg; of frost! We
have frostbitten fingers and ears, and a strong blizzard wind has
been blowing from the south all day, all due to the fact that we
have climbed to an altitude of over 8000 ft. above sea-level.
From early morning we have been striving to the south, but six
miles is the total distance gained, for from noon, or rather from
lunch at 1 p.m., we have been hauling the sledges up, one after
the other, by standing pulls across crevasses and over great
pressure ridges. When we had advanced one sledge some distance,
we put up a flag on a bamboo to mark its position, and then roped
up and returned for the other. The wind, no doubt, has a great
deal to do with the low temperature, and we feel the cold, as we
are going on short commons. The altitude adds to the
difficulties, but we are getting south all the time. We started
away from camp at 6.45 a.m. to-day, and except for an hour's halt
at lunch, worked on until 6 p.m. Now we are camped in a filled-up
crevasse, the only place where snow to put round the tents can be
obtained, for all the rest of the ground we are on is either n&eacute;v&eacute;
or hard ice. We little thought that this particular pressure
ridge was going to be such an obstacle; it looked quite ordinary,
even a short way off, but we have now decided to trust nothing to
eyesight, for the distances are so deceptive up here. It is a
wonderful sight to look down over the glacier from the great
altitude we are at, and to see the mountains stretching away east
and west, some of them over 15,000 ft. in height. We are very
hungry now, and it seems as cold almost as the spring sledging.
Our beards are masses of ice all day long. Thank God we are fit
and well and have had no accident, which is a mercy, seeing that
we have covered over 130 miles of crevassed ice.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 22. As I write of to-day's events, I can
easily imagine I am on a spring sledging journey, for the
temperature is minus 5&deg; Fahr. and a chilly south-easterly wind is
blowing and finds its way through the walls of our tent, which
are getting worn. All day long, from 7 a.m., except for the hour
when we stopped for lunch, we have been relaying the sledges over
the pressure mounds and across crevasses. Our total distance to
the good for the whole day was only four miles southward, but
this evening our prospects look brighter, for we must now have
come to the end of the great glacier. It is flattening out, and
except for crevasses there will not be much trouble in hauling
the sledges to-morrow. One sledge to-day, when coming down with a
run over a pressure ridge, turned a complete somersault, but
nothing was damaged, in spite of the total weight being over 400
lb. We are now dragging 400 lb. at a time up the steep slopes and
across the ridges, working with the alpine rope all day, and
roping ourselves together when we go back for the second sledge,
for the ground is so treacherous that many times during the day
we are saved only by the rope from falling into fathomless pits.
Wild describes the sensation of walking over this surface, half
ice and half snow, as like walking over the glass roof of a
station. The usual query when one of us falls into a crevasse is:
"Have you found it?" One gets somewhat callous as regards the
immediate danger, though we are always glad to meet crevasses
with their coats off, that is, not hidden by the snow covering.
To-night we arc camped in a filled-in crevasse. Away to the north
down the glacier a thick cumulus cloud is lying, but some of the
largest mountains are standing out clearly. Immediately behind us
lies a broken sea of pressure ice. Please God, ahead of us there
is a clear road to the Pole.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 23. Eight thousand eight hundred and twenty
feet up, and still steering upwards amid great waves of pressure
and ice-falls, for our plateau, after a good morning's march,
began to rise in higher ridges, so that it really was not the
plateau after all. To-day's crevasses have been far more
dangerous than any others we have crossed, as the soft snow hides
all trace of them until we fall through. Constantly to-day one or
another of the party has had to be hauled out from a chasm by
means of his harness, which had alone saved him from death in the
icy vault below. We started at 6.40 a.m. and worked on steadily
until 6 p.m., with the usual lunch hour in the middle of the day.
The pony maize does not swell in the water now, as the
temperature is very low and the water freezes. The result is that
it swells inside after we have eaten it. We are very hungry
indeed, and talk a great deal of what we would like to eat. In
spite of the crevasses, we have done thirteen miles to-day to the
south, and we are now in latitude 85&deg; 41' South. The temperature
at noon was plus 6&deg; Fahr. and at 6 p.m. it was minus 1&deg; Fahr.,
but it is much lower at night. There was a strong south-east to
south-south-east wind blowing all day, and it was cutting to our
noses and burst lips. Wild was frostbitten. I do trust that
to-morrow will see the end of this bad travelling, so that we can
stretch out our legs for the Pole.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 24. A much better day for us; indeed, the
brightest we have had since entering our Southern Gateway. We
started off at 7 a.m. across waves and undulations of ice, with
some one or other of our little party falling through the thin
crust of snow every now and then. At 10.30 a.m. I decided to
steer more to the west, and we soon got on to a better surface,
and covered 5 miles 250 yards in the forenoon. After lunch, as
the surface was distinctly improving, we discarded the second
sledge, and started our afternoon's march with one sledge. It has
been blowing freshly from the south and drifting all day, and
this, with over 40&deg; of frost, has coated our faces with ice. We
get superficial frostbites every now and then. During the
afternoon the surface improved greatly, and the cracks and
crevasses disappeared, but we are still going uphill, and from
the summit of one ridge saw some new land, which runs
south-south-east down to latitude 86&deg; South. We camped at 6 p.m.,
very tired and with cold feet. We have only the clothes we stand
up in now, as we depoted everything else, and this continued rise
means lower temperatures than I had anticipated. To-night we are
9095 ft. above sea-level, and the way before us is still rising.
I trust that it will soon level out, for it is hard work pulling
at this altitude. So far there is no sign of the very hard
surface that Captain Scott speaks of in connection with his
journey on the Northern Plateau. There seem to be just here
regular layers of snow, not much windswept, but we will see
better the surface conditions in a few days. To-morrow will be
Christmas Day, and our thoughts turn to home and all the
attendant joys of the time. One longs to hear "the hansoms
slurring through the London mud." Instead of that we are lying in
a little tent, isolated high on the roof of the end of the world,
far, indeed, from the ways trodden of men. Still, our thoughts
can fly across the wastes of ice and snow and across the oceans
to those whom we are striving for and who are thinking of us now.
And, thank God, we are nearing our goal. The distance covered
to-day was 11 miles 250 yards.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 25. Christmas Day. There has been from 45&deg; to
48&deg; of frost, drifting snow and a strong biting south wind, and
such has been the order of the day's march from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.
up one of the steepest rises we have yet done, crevassed in
places. Now, as I write, we are 9500 ft. above sea-level, and our
latitude at 6 p.m. was 85&deg; 55' South. We started away after a
good breakfast, and soon came to soft snow, through which our
worn and torn sledge-runners dragged heavily. All morning we
hauled along, and at noon had done 5 miles 250 yards. Sights gave
us latitude 85&deg; 51' South. We had lunch then, and I took a
photograph of the camp with the Queen's flag flying and also our
tent flags, my companions being in the picture. It was very cold,
the temperature being minus 16&deg; Fahr., and the wind went through
us. All the afternoon we worked steadily uphill, and we could see
at 6 p.m. the new land plainly trending to the south-east. This
land is very much glaciated. It is comparatively bare of snow,
and there are well-defined glaciers on the side of the range,
which seems to end up in the south-east with a large mountain
like a keep. We have called it "The Castle." Behind these the
mountains have more gentle slopes and are more rounded. They seem
to fall away to the south-east, so that, as we are going south,
the angle opens and we will soon miss them. When we camped at 6
p.m. the wind was decreasing. It is hard to understand this soft
snow with such a persistent wind, and I can only suppose that we
have not yet reached the actual plateau level, and that the snow
we are travelling over just now is on the slopes, blown down by
the south and south-east wind. We had a splendid dinner. First
came hoosh, consisting of pony ration boiled up with pemmican and
some of our emergency Oxo and biscuit. Then in the cocoa water I
boiled our little plum pudding, which a friend of Wild's had
given him. This, with a drop of medical brandy, was a luxury
which Lucullus himself might have envied; then came cocoa, and
lastly cigars and a spoonful of <i>creme de menthe</i> sent us by
a friend in Scotland. We are full to-night, and this is the last
time we will be for many a long day. After dinner we discussed
the situation, and we have decided to still further reduce our
food. We have now nearly 500 miles, geographical, to do if we are
to get to the Pole and back to the spot where we are at the
present moment. We have one month's food, but only three weeks'
biscuit, so we are going to make each week's food last ten days.
We will have one biscuit in the morning, three at midday, and two
at night. It is the only thing to do. To-morrow we will throw
away everything except the most absolute necessities. Already we
are, as regards clothes, down to the limit, but we must trust to
the old sledge-runners and dump the spare ones. One must risk
this. We are very far away from all the world, and home thoughts
have been much with us to-day, thoughts interrupted by pitching
forward into a hidden crevasse more than once. Ah, well, we shall
see all our own people when the work here is done. Marshall took
our temperatures to-night. We are all two degrees sub normal, but
as fit as can be. It is a fine open-air life and we are getting
south.</p>

<small>111. THE CHRISTMAS CAMP ON THE PLATEAU. THE FIGURES FROM
LEFT TO RIGHT ARE ADAMS, MARSHALL AND WILD. THE FROST CAN BE SEEN
ON THE MEN'S FACES</small></p>
<p><i>December</i> 26. Got away at 7 a.m. sharp, after dumping a
lot of gear. We marched steadily all day except for lunch, and we
have done 14 miles 480 yards on an uphill march, with soft snow
at times and a bad wind. Ridge after ridge we met, and though the
surface is better and harder in places, we feel very tired at the
end of ten hours' pulling. Our height to-night is 9590 ft. above
sea-level according to the hypsometer. The ridges we meet with
are almost similar in appearance. We see the sun shining on them
in the distance, and then the rise begins very gradually. The
snow gets soft, and the weight of the sledge becomes more marked.
As we near the top the soft snow gives place to a hard surface,
and on the summit of the ridge we find small crevasses. Every
time we reach the top of a ridge we say to ourselves: "Perhaps
this is the last", but it never is the last; always there appears
away ahead of us another ridge. I do not think that the land lies
very far below the ice-sheet, for the crevasses on the summits of
the ridges suggest that the sheet is moving over land at no great
depth. It would seem that the descent towards the glacier proper
from the plateau is by a series of terraces. We lost sight of the
land to-day, having left it all behind us, and now we have the
waste of snow all around. Two more days and our maize will be
finished. Then our hooshes will be more woefully thin than ever.
This shortness of food is unpleasant, but if we allow ourselves
what, under ordinary circumstances, would be a reasonable amount,
we would have to abandon all idea of getting far south.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 27. If a great snow plain, rising every seven
miles in a steep ridge, can be called a plateau, then we are on
it at last, with an altitude above the sea of 9820 ft. We started
at 7 a.m. and marched till noon, encountering at 11 a.m. a steep
snow ridge which pretty well cooked us, but we got the sledge up
by noon and camped. We are pulling 150 lb. per man. In the
afternoon we had good going till 5 p.m. and then another ridge as
difficult as the previous one, so that our backs and legs were in
a bad way when we reached the top at 6 p.m., having done 14 miles
930 yards for the day. Thank heaven it has been a fine day, with
little wind. The temperature is minus 9&deg; Fahr. This surface is
most peculiar, showing layers of snow with little sastrugi all
pointing south-south-east. Short food make us think of plum
puddings, and hard half-cooked maize gives us indigestion, but we
are getting south. The latitude is 86&deg; 19' South to-night. Our
thoughts are with the people at home a great deal.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 28. If the Barrier is a changing sea, the
plateau is a changing sky. During the morning march we continued
to go up hill steadily, but the surface was constantly changing.
First there was soft snow in layers, then soft snow so deep that
we were well over our ankles, and the temperature being well
below zero, our feet were cold through sinking in. No one can say
what we are going to find next, but we can go steadily ahead. We
started at 6.55 a.m., and had done 7 miles 200 yards by noon, the
pulling being very hard. Some of the snow is blown into hard
sastrugi, some that looks perfectly smooth and hard has only a
thin crust through which we break when pulling; all of it is a
trouble. Yesterday we passed our last crevasse, though there are
a few cracks or ridges fringed with shining crystals like
diamonds, warning us that the cracks are open. We are now 10,199
ft. above sea-level, and the plateau is gradually flattening out,
but it was heavy work pulling this afternoon. The high altitude,
and a temperature of 48&deg; of frost made breathing and work
difficult. We are getting south&mdash;latitude 86&deg; 31' South
to-night. The last sixty miles we hope to rush, leaving
everything possible, taking one tent only and using the poles of
the other as marks every ten miles, for we will leave all our
food sixty miles off the Pole except enough to carry us there and
back. I hope with good weather to reach the Pole on January 12,
and then we will try and rush it to get to Hut Point by February
28. We are so tired after each hour's pulling that we throw
ourselves on our backs for a three minutes' spell. It took us
over ten hours to do 14 miles 450 yards to-day, but we did it all
right. It is a wonderful thing to be over 10,000 ft. up at the
end of the world almost. The short food is trying, but when we
have done the work we will be happy. Adams had a bad headache all
yesterday, and to-day I had the same trouble, but it is better
now. Otherwise we are all fit and well. I think the country is
flattening out more and more, and hope to-morrow to make fifteen
miles, at least.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 29. Yesterday I wrote that we hoped to do
fifteen miles to-day, but such is the variable character of this
surface that one cannot prophesy with any certainty an hour
ahead. A strong southerly wind, with from 44&deg; to 49&deg; of frost,
combined with the effect of short rations, made our distance 12
miles 600 yards instead. We have reached an altitude of 10,310
ft., and an uphill gradient gave us one of the most severe pulls
for ten hours that would be possible. It looks serious, for we
must increase the food if we are to get on at all, and we must
risk a depot at seventy miles off the Pole and dash for it then.
Our sledge is badly strained, and on the abominably bad surface
of soft snow is dreadfully hard to move. I have been suffering
from a bad headache all day, and Adams also was worried by the
cold. I think that these headaches are a form of mountain
sickness, due to our high altitude. The others have bled from the
nose, and that must relieve them. Physical effort is always
trying at a high altitude, and we are straining at the harness
all day, sometimes slipping in the soft snow that overlies the
hard sastrugi. My head is very bad. The sensation is as though
the nerves were being twisted up with a corkscrew and then pulled
out. Marshall took our temperatures to-night, and we are all at
about 94&deg;, but in spite of this we are getting south. We are only
198 miles off our goal now. If the rise would stop the cold would
not matter, but it is hard to know what is man's limit. We have
only 150 lb. per man to pull, but it is more severe work than the
250 lb. per man up the glacier was. The Pole is hard to get.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 30. We only did 4 miles 100 yards to-day. We
started at 7 a.m., but had to camp at 11 a.m., a blizzard
springing up from the south. It is more than annoying. I cannot
express my feelings. We were pulling at last on a level surface,
but very soft snow, when at about 10 a.m. the south wind and
drift commenced to increase, and at 11 a.m. it was so bad that we
had to camp. And here all day we have been lying in our
sleeping-bags trying to keep warm and listening to the threshing
drift on the tent-side. I am in the cooking-tent, and the wind
comes through, it is so thin. Our precious food is going and the
time also, and it is so important to us to get on. We lie here
and think of how to make things better, but we cannot reduce food
now, and the only thing will be to rush all possible at the end.
We will do, and are doing all humanly possible. It is with
Providence to help us.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 31. The last day of the old year, and the
hardest day we have had almost, pushing through soft snow uphill
with a strong head wind and drift all day. The temperature is
minus 7&deg; Fahr., and our altitude is 10,4.77 ft. above sea-level.
The altitude is trying. My head has been very bad all day, and we
are all feeling the short food, but still we are getting south.
We are in latitude 86&deg; 54' South to-night, but we have only three
weeks' food and two weeks' biscuit to do nearly 500 geographical
miles. We can only do our best. Too tired to write more to-night.
We all get iced-up about our faces, and are on the verge of
frostbite all the time. Please God the weather will be fine
during the next fourteen days. Then all will be well. The
distance to-day was eleven miles.</p>
<blockquote>Note. If we had only known that we were going to get
such cold weather as we were at this time experiencing, we would
have kept a pair of scissors to trim our beards. The moisture
from the condensation of one's breath accumulated on the beard
and trickled down on to the Burberry blouse. Then it froze into a
sheet of ice inside, and it became very painful to pull the
Burberry off in camp. Little troubles of this sort would have
seemed less serious to us if we had been able to get a decent
feed at the end of the day's work, but we were very hungry. We
thought of food most of the time. The chocolate certainly seemed
better than the cheese, because the two spoonfuls of cheese per
man allowed under our scale of diet would not last as long as the
two sticks of chocolate. We did not have both at the same meal.
We had the bad luck at this time to strike a tin in which the
biscuits were thin and overbaked. Under ordinary circumstances
they would probably have tasted rather better than the other
biscuits, but we wanted bulk. We soaked them in our tea so that
they would swell up and appear larger, but if one soaked a
biscuit too much, the sensation of biting something was lost, and
the food seemed to disappear much too easily.</blockquote>
<p><i>January</i> 1. Head too bad to write much. We did 11 miles
900 yards (statute) to-day, and the latitude at 6 p.m. was 87&deg;
6&frac12;' South, so we have beaten North and South records. Struggling
uphill all day in very soft snow. Every one done up and weak from
want of food. When we camped at 6 p.m. fine warm weather, thank
God. Only 172&frac12; miles from the Pole. The height above sea-level,
now 10,755 ft., makes all work difficult. Surface seems to be
better ahead. I do trust it will be so to-morrow.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 2. Terribly hard work to-day. We started at
6.45 a.m. with a fairly good surface, which soon became very
soft. We were sinking in over our ankles, and our broken sledge,
by running sideways, added to the drag. We have been going uphill
all day, and to-night are 11,034 ft. above sea-level. It has
taken us all day to do 10 miles 450 yards, though the weights are
fairly light. A cold wind, with a temperature of minus 14&deg; Fahr.,
goes right through us now, as we are weakening from want of food,
and the high altitude makes every movement an effort, especially
if we stumble on the march. My head is giving me trouble all the
time. Wild seems the most fit of us. God knows we are doing all
we can, but the outlook is serious if this surface continues and
the plateau gets higher, for we are not travelling fast enough to
make our food spin out and get back to our depot in time. I
cannot think of failure yet. I must look at the matter sensibly
and consider the lives of those who are with me. I feel that if
we go on too far it will be impossible to get back over this
surface, and then all the results will be lost to the world. We
can now definitely locate the South Pole on the highest plateau
in the world, and our geological work and meteorology will be of
the greatest use to science; but all this is not the Pole. Man
can only do his best, and we have arrayed against us the
strongest forces of nature. This cutting south wind with drift
plays the mischief with us, and after ten hours of struggling
against it one pannikin of food with two biscuits and a cup of
cocoa does not warm one up much. I must think over the situation
carefully to-morrow, for time is going on and food is going
also.</p>

<br>
<small>112. FACSIMILE OF PAGE OF SHACKLETON'S DIARY</small></p>
<p><i>January</i> 3. Started at 6.55 a.m., cloudy but fairly
warm. The temperature was minus 8&deg; Fahr. at noon. We had a
terrible surface all the morning, and did only 5 miles 100 yards.
A meridian altitude gave us latitude 87&deg; 22' South at noon. The
surface was better in the afternoon, and we did six geographical
miles. The temperature at 6 p.m. was minus 11&deg; Fahr. It was an
uphill pull towards the evening, and we camped at 6.20 p.m., the
altitude being 11,220 ft. above the sea. To-morrow we must risk
making a depot on the plateau, and make a dash for it, but even
then, if this surface continues, we will be two weeks in carrying
it through.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 4. The end is in sight. We can only go for
three more days at the most, for we are weakening rapidly. Short
food and a blizzard wind from the south, with driving drift, at a
temperature of 47&deg; of frost have plainly told us to-day that we
are reaching our limit, for we were so done up at noon with cold
that the clinical thermometer failed to register the temperature
of three of us at 94&deg;. We started at 7.40 a.m., leaving a depot
on this great wide plateau, a risk that only this case justified,
and one that my comrades agreed to, as they have to every one so
far, with the same cheerfulness and regardlessness of self that
have been the means of our getting as far as we have done so far.
Pathetically small looked the bamboo, one of the tent poles, with
a bit of bag sown on as a flag, to mark our stock of provisions,
which has to take us back to our depot, one hundred and fifty
miles north. We lost sight of it in half an hour, and are now
trusting to our footprints in the snow to guide us back to each
bamboo until we pick up the depot again. I trust that the weather
will keep clear. To-day we have done 12| geographical miles, and
with only 70 lb. per man to pull it is as hard, even harder, work
than the 100 odd lb. was yesterday, and far harder than the 250
lb. were three weeks ago, when we were climbing the glacier.
This, I consider, is a clear indication of our failing strength.
The main thing against us is the altitude of 11,200 ft. and the
biting wind. Our faces are cut, and our feet and hands are always
on the verge of frostbite. Our fingers, indeed, often go, but we
get them round more or less. I have great trouble with two
fingers on my left hand. They have been badly jammed when we were
getting the motor up over the ice face at winter quarters, and
the circulation is not good. Our boots now are pretty well worn
out, and we have to halt at times to pick the snow out of the
soles. Our stock of sennegrass is nearly exhausted, so we have to
use the same frozen stuff day after day. Another trouble is that
the lamp-wick with which we tie the finnesko is chafed through,
and we have to tie knots in it. These knots catch the snow under
our feet, making a lump that has to be cleared every now and
then. I am of the opinion that to sledge even in the height of
summer on this plateau, we should have at least forty ounces of
food a day per man, and we are on short rations of the ordinary
allowance of thirty-two ounces. We depoted our extra
underclothing to save weight about three weeks ago, and are now
in the same clothes night and day. One suit of underclothing,
shirt and guernsey, and our thin Burberries, now all patched.
When we get up in the morning, out of the wet bag, our Burberries
become like a coat of mail at once, and our heads and beards get
iced-up with the moisture when breathing on the march. There is
half a gale blowing dead in our teeth all the time. We hope to
reach within 100 geographical miles of the Pole; under the
circumstances we can expect to do very little more. I am
confident that the Pole lies on the great plateau we have
discovered, miles and miles from any outstanding land. The
temperature to-night is minus 24&deg; Fahr.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 5. To-day head wind and drift again, with 50&deg;
of frost, and a terrible surface. We have been marching through 8
in. of snow, covering sharp sastrugi, which plays hell with our
feet, but we have done 13 1/3 geographical miles, for we
increased our food, seeing that it was absolutely necessary to do
this to enable us to accomplish anything. I realise that the food
we have been having has not been sufficient to keep up our
strength, let alone supply the wastage caused by exertion, and
now we must try to keep warmth in us, though our strength is
being used up. Our temperatures at 5 a.m. were 94&deg; Fahr. We got
away at 7 a.m. sharp and marched till noon, then from 1 p.m.
sharp till 6 p.m. All being in one tent makes our camp-work
slower, for we are so cramped for room, and we get up at 4.40
a.m. so as to get away by 7 a.m. Two of us have to stand outside
the tent at night until things are squared up inside, and we find
it cold work. Hunger grips us hard, and the food-supply is very
small. My head still gives me great trouble. I began by wishing
that my worst enemy had it instead of myself, but now I don't
wish even my worst enemy to have such a headache; still, it is no
use talking about it. Self is a subject that most of us are
fluent on. We find the utmost difficulty in carrying through the
day, and we can only go for two or three more days. Never once
has the temperature been above zero since we got on to the
plateau, though this is the height of summer. We have done our
best, and we thank God for having allowed us to get so far.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 6. This must be our last outward march with the
sledge and camp equipment. To-morrow we must leave camp with some
food, and push as far south as possible, and then plant the flag.
To-day's story is 57&deg; of frost, with a strong blizzard and high
drift; yet we marched 13&frac14; geographical miles through soft snow,
being helped by extra food. This does not mean full rations, but
a bigger ration than we have been having lately. The pony maize
is all finished. The most trying day we have yet spent, our
fingers and faces being frostbitten continually. To-morrow we
will rush south with the flag. We are at 88&deg; 7' South to-night.
It is our last outward march. Blowing hard to-night. I would fail
to explain my feelings if I tried to write them down, now that
the end has come. There is only one thing that lightens the
disappointment, and that is the feeling that we have done all we
could. It is the forces of nature that have prevented us from
going right through. I cannot write more.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 7. A blinding, shrieking blizzard all day, with
the temperature ranging from 60&deg; to 70&deg; of frost. It has been
impossible to leave the tent, which is snowed up on the lee side.
We have been lying in our bags all day, only warm at food time,
with fine snow making through the walls of the worn tent and
covering our bags. We are greatly cramped. Adams is suffering
from cramp every now and then. We are eating our valuable food
without marching. The wind has been blowing eighty to ninety
miles an hour. We can hardly sleep. To-morrow I trust this will
be over. Directly the wind drops we march as far south as
possible, then plant the flag, and turn homeward. Our chief
anxiety is lest our tracks may drift up, for to them we must
trust mainly to find our depot; we have no land bearings in this
great plain of snow. It is a serious risk that we have taken, but
we had to play the game to the utmost, and Providence will look
after us.</p>

<br>
<small>113. THE FARTHEST SOUTH CAMP AFTER SIXTY HOURS'
BLIZZARD</small></p>
<p><i>January</i> 8. Again all day in our bags, suffering
considerably physically from cold hands and feet, and from
hunger, but more mentally, for we cannot get on south, and we
simply lie here shivering. Every now and then one of our party's
feet go, and the unfortunate beggar has to take his leg out of
the sleeping-bag and have his frozen foot nursed into life again
by placing it inside the shirt, against the skin of his almost
equally unfortunate neighbour. We must do something more to the
south, even though the food is going, and we weaken lying in the
cold, for with 72&deg; of frost, the wind cuts through our thin tent,
and even the drift is finding its way in and on to our bags,
which are wet enough as it is. Cramp is not uncommon every now
and then, and the drift all round the tent has made it so small
that there is hardly room for us at all. The wind has been
blowing hard all day; some of the gusts must be over seventy or
eighty miles an hour. This evening it seems as though it were
going to ease down, and directly it does we shall be up and away
south for a rush. I feel that this march must be our limit. We
are so short of food, and at this high altitude, 11,600 ft., it
is hard to keep any warmth in our bodies between the scanty
meals. We have nothing to read now, having depoted our little
books to save weight, and it is dreary work lying in the tent
with nothing to read, and too cold to write much in the
diary.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 9. Our last day outwards. We have shot our
bolt, and the tale is latitude 88&deg; 23' South, longitude 162&deg;
East. The wind eased down at 1 a.m., and at 2 a.m. were up and
had breakfast. At 4 a.m. started south, with the Queen's Union
Jack, a brass cylinder containing stamps and documents to place
at the furthest south point, camera, glasses and compass. At 9
a.m. we were in 88&deg; 23' South, half running and half walking over
a surface much hardened by the recent blizzard. It was strange
for us to go along without the nightmare of a sledge dragging
behind us. We hoisted her Majesty's flag and the other Union Jack
afterwards, and took possession of the plateau in the name of his
Majesty. While the Union Jack blew out stiffly in the icy gale
that cut us to the bone, we looked south with our powerful
glasses, but could see nothing but the dead white snow plain.
There was no break in the plateau as it extended towards the
Pole, and we feel sure that the goal we have failed to reach lies
on this plain. We stayed only a few minutes, and then, taking the
Queen's flag and eating our scanty meal as we went, we hurried
back and reached our camp about 3 p.m. We were so dead tired that
we only did two hours' march in the afternoon and camped at 5.30
p.m. The temperature was minus 19&deg; Fahr. Fortunately for us, our
tracks were not obliterated by the blizzard; indeed, they stood
up, making a trail easily followed. Homeward bound at last.
Whatever regrets may be, we have done our best.</p>

<br>
<h3>THE RETURN MARCH</h3>
<p><b>JANUARY 10</b>. We started at 7.30 a.m. with a fair wind,
and marched all day, with a stop of one hour for lunch, doing
over 18&frac12; geographical miles to the north. It has, indeed, been
fortunate for us that we have been able to follow our outward
tracks, for the force of the gale had torn the flags from the
staffs. We will be all right when we pick up our depot. It has
been a big risk leaving our food on the great white plain, with
only our sledge tracks to guide us back. To-night we are all
tired out, but we have put a good march behind us. The
temperature is minus 9&deg; Fahr.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 11. A good day. We have done nearly 17
geographical miles. We have picked up our depot and now are
following the sledge tracks to the north. The temperature has
been minus 15&deg; Fahr. There has been tremendous wind here, and the
sastrugi are enormous.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 12. We did 14 miles 100 yards to-day with
little wind to help us. The surface was very heavy and we found
enormous sastrugi. The wind is getting up to-night. I hope for a
good breeze behind us to-morrow.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 13. It was heavy pulling all day, but we did a
good distance in spite of it, getting 15 miles 1650 yards to the
north. We have the sail up continually, but I cannot say that it
has been very much help to-day.</p>
<p>The temperature, minus 18&deg; Fahr. nearly all the time, makes
things very cold, and we ourselves slept badly last night. I did
not sleep at all, for both my heels are frostbitten and have
cracked open, and I also have cracks under some of my toes; but
we can march all right, and are moving over the ground very fast.
We must continue to do so, for we have only about 20 lb. of
biscuit to last us over 140 miles, and I expect there will be
little in the locker by the time we strike our glacier head
depot. The surface has been very severe to-day.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 14. A strong following blizzard all day gave us
our best day's run of the whole trip, 20 miles 1600 yards in ten
hours. We decided to cut down the rations by another biscuit, as
we have only six days' biscuit left on short ration, and 120
miles to go before we reach the depot, so we feel very hungry,
and with the temperature minus 18&deg; Fahr. to minus 21&deg; Fahr. all
day in the wind, one easily gets frostbitten.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 15. Started in a strong blizzard at 7.30 a.m.
with a temperature of minus 23&deg; Fahr., and marched steadily till
noon, doing 9&frac12; miles; then marched from 1.30 p.m. till 6 p.m.,
making a total distance for the day of 20 miles, statute. It has
been thick, with a pale sun only shining through, but we are
still able to follow our old sledge tracks, though at times they
are very faint. Unfortunately, when we halted at 3.30 p.m. for a
spell, we found that the sledge meter had disappeared, and
discovered that it had broken off short at the brass fitting.
This is a serious loss to us, for all our Barrier distances
between depots are calculated on it, and although we have another
depoted at the foot of the glacier we do not know the slip. We
now must judge distance till we get a sight of land.</p>

<small>115. PARTS OF THE COMMONWEALTH AND DOMINION RANGES,
PHOTOGRAPHED ON THE WAY DOWN THE GLACIER. PRESSURE ICE SHOWS AT
THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS</small></p>
<p><i>January</i> 16. With a strong following blizzard, we did
18&frac12; miles to the north to-day. My burst heels gave me great pain
all day. Marshall dressed them to-night. We saw the land again
to-day after being out of sight of it for three weeks nearly.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 17. Started sharp at 7 a.m., and in a fresh
blizzard wind, with a temperature of minus 23&deg; Fahr., we did our
best march, for it was mainly downhill and we covered 22&frac12; miles.
At 10 a.m. we came up to our Christmas camp, and there took on a
bamboo we had left, and which now comes in useful for our sail.
This sail is now our great help. We dropped over 500 ft. to-day,
and in three days ought to reach our depot at this rate.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 18. Our best day, 26&frac12; miles downhill, with a
strong following wind. We have nearly got to the end of the main
icefall. The temperature has risen sensibly, it being minus 14&deg;
Fahr. to-night, and the hypsometer, 196.5&deg;, shows a good rise.
With luck we may reach our depot to-morrow night. With food now
in hand, we had a decent feed to-night. I have been very unlucky
to-day, falling into many crevasses and hurting my shoulder
badly. I have also had many falls, besides the trouble with the
bad heels on the hard stuff.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 19. Another record day, for we have done about
twenty-nine miles to the north, rushing under sail down icefalls
and through crevasses, till, at 6 p.m., we picked up our sledge
tracks of December 18 outwards. We camped, dead beat, at 6.30
p.m., and had a good hoosh. We have descended to 7500 ft., and
the temperature to-night is minus 14&deg; Fahr. We are now only 8&frac12;
miles from our depot, which we will reach to-morrow morning, all
being well. This strong blizzard wind has been an immense help
this way, though not outwards for us.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 20. Although we have not covered so much ground
to-day, we have had an infinitely harder time. We started at 7
a.m. on our tracks of December 19, and at 7.30 passed the camp of
the evening of the 18th. For two hours we were descending a
snow-slope, with heavy sastrugi, and then struck a patch of badly
crevassed n&eacute;v&eacute;, about half a mile across. After that we got on to
blue slippery ice, where our finnesko had no hold. A gale was
blowing, and often fierce gusts came along, sweeping the sledge
sideways, and knocking us off our feet. We all had many falls,
and I had two specially heavy ones which shook me up severely.
When we reached the steep slopes where we had roped the sledges
up on our outward journey, we lowered the sledge down by means of
the alpine rope, using an ice-axe as a bollard to lower by. On
several occasions one or more of us lost our footing, and were
swept by the wind down the ice-slope, with great difficulty
getting back to our sledge and companions. We arrived at our
depot at 12.30 p.m. with sore and aching bodies. The afternoon
was rather better, as, after the first hour, we got off the blue
ice on to snow. However bad as the day has been, we have said
farewell to that awful plateau, and are well on our way down the
glacier.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 21. Started at 7.45 a.m. with a fresh southerly
breeze, so we still have valuable assistance from our sail. The
heavy falls I had yesterday have so shaken me that I have been
very ill to-day. I harnessed up for a while, but soon had to give
up pulling and walk by the sledge; but, as the course has been
downhill nearly all day and a fair wind has been assisting, the
others have had no difficulty in getting along at a good pace,
and we have covered seventeen miles. The weather is much warmer,
the temperature to-night being about minus 1&deg; Fahr.</p>

<br>
<small>116. THE QUEEN ALEXANDRA RANGE, PHOTOGRAPHED ON THE WAY
DOWN THE GLACIER</small></p>
<p><i>January</i> 22. Started at 7.30 a.m. on a good surface that
changed to crevassed ice slopes in the afternoon, down which we
made fair progress. Am still too ill to harness up, but as the
pull was not much it did not matter. Indeed, we had another man
out of harness guiding the sledge. The distance to-day was 15&frac12;
miles.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 23. Similar weather, surface and work. Fine and
warm; temperature plus 8&deg; Fahr.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 24. One of our hardest day's work, and
certainly the longest, for we started at 6.45 a.m., went on till
12.50 p.m., had lunch, started at 2 p M., went on till 6 p.m.,
had a cup of tea, and went on till 9 p.m. Then we had our single
pot of hoosh and one biscuit, for we have only two days' food
left and one day's biscuit on much reduced ration, and we have to
cover forty miles of crevasses to reach our depot before we can
get any more food. I am now all right again, though rather weak.
We had a terribly hard time in the crevassed ice this morning,
and now our sledge has not much more than half a runner on one
side, and is in a very shaky state. However, I believe we are
safe now. The distance to-day was sixteen miles, statute.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 25. We started away from camp at 6.45 a.m.,
marched till noon, when we had a cup of tea, and then marched
till 3 p.m., when we had lunch, consisting of a cup of tea, two
biscuits, two spoonsful of cheese. Then we marched till 9 p.m.,
when we had one pot of hoosh and one biscuit. We did twenty-six
miles; fine weather. The food is all finished but one meal. No
biscuit, only cocoa, tea, salt and pepper left, very little of
these also. Must reach depot to-morrow. It was fairly good going
to-day till the last two hours, and then we were falling into
most dangerous crevasses and were saved only by our harness. Very
tired indeed. Thank God warm and fine weather. We can see our
depot rock in the distance, so hope to reach it to-morrow.
Turning in now, 11 p.m.; breakfast as usual 5 a.m. The
temperature is plus 12&deg; Fahr.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 26 and 27. Two days written up as one, and they
have been the hardest and most trying we have ever spent in our
lives, and will ever stand in our memories. To-night (the 27th)
we have had our first solid food since the morning of the 26th.
We came to the end of all our provisions except a little cocoa
and tea, and from 7 a.m. on the 26th till 2 p.m. on the 27th we
did sixteen miles over the worst surfaces and most dangerous
crevasses we have ever encountered, only stopping for tea or
cocoa till they were finished, and marching twenty hours at a
stretch, through snow 10 to 18 in. thick as a rule, with
sometimes 2&frac12; ft. of it. We fell into hidden crevasses time after
time, and were saved by each other and by our harness. In fact,
only an all-merciful Providence has guided our steps to
to-night's safety at our depot. I cannot describe adequately the
mental and physical strain of the last forty-eight hours. When we
started at 7 a.m. yesterday, we immediately got into soft snow,
an uphill pull with hidden crevasses. The biscuit was all
finished, and with only one pannikin of hoosh, mostly pony maize,
and one of tea, we marched till noon. Then we had one pannikin of
tea and one ounce of chocolate, and marched till 4.45 p.m. We had
one pannikin of tea. There was no more food. We marched till 10
p.m., then one small pannikin of cocoa. Marched till 2 a.m., when
we were played out. We had one pannikin of cocoa, and slept till
8 a.m. Then a pannikin of cocoa, and we marched till 1 p.m. and
camped, about half a mile from the depot. Marshall went on for
food, and we got a meal at 2 p.m. We turned in and slept. Adams
fell exhausted in his harness, but recovered and went on again.
Wild did the same the night before.</p>

<br>
<small>117. THE CAMP UNDER THE GRANITE PILLAR, HALF A MILE FROM
THE LOWER GLACIER DEPOT, WHERE THE PARTY CAMPED ON JANUARY
27</small></p>
<p><i>January</i> 28. Thank God we are on the Barrier again at
last. We got up at 1 a.m. this morning, had breakfast, consisting
of tea and one biscuit, and got under way at 3 a.m. We reached
the depot in half an hour without any difficulty. The snow here
was deep enough to carry us over the crevasses that had impeded
our progress so much on the outward march. We had proper
breakfast at 5 a.m. then dug out our depot. The alternate falls
of snow and thaws had frozen solidly in a great deal of our gear,
and our spare sledge meter was deeply buried. We marched along
till we were close to the Gap, then had lunch. At 1 p.m. we were
through the Gap and on to the crevassed and ridged Barrier
surface. We are now safe, with six days' food and only fifty
miles to the depot, but Wild has developed dysentery. We are at a
loss to know what is the cause of it. It may possibly be due to
the horse-meat. The weather has been fairly fine all day, though
clouding up from the south towards noon, and we were assisted by
a fresh southerly breeze up the slope to the head of the Gap.
Indeed, we needed it, for the heavy surface and our dilapidated
sledge made the hauling extremely hard. Just before we left the
glacier I broke through the soft snow, plunging into a hidden
crevasse. My harness jerked up under my heart, and gave me rather
a shake up. It seemed as though the glacier were saying: "There
is the last touch for you; don't you come up here again." It was
with a feeling of intense relief that we left this great glacier,
for the strain has been hard, and now we know that except for
blizzards and thick weather, which two factors can alone prevent
us from finding our depots in good time, we will be all right.
The light became bad this evening when we were on the last hour
before camping, and we cannot say for certain whether we are
clear of the main chasm by the land or not, so must give its line
of direction a wide berth. The temperature is well up, plus 26&deg;
Fahr., and it is warm indeed after the minus temperatures which
have been our lot for the last month or so.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 29. We are having a most unfriendly greeting
from the Barrier. We got up as usual and had breakfast at 5.30
a.m., the weather thick and overcast, but the land showing enough
for us to steer by. We got away at 7.20 a.m., and soon after it
began to snow, which in a temperature of plus 30&deg; Fahr. melted on
the sledge and all our gear, making everything into a miserably
wet state. We had to put the compass down every now and then, for
it became too thick to see any landmarks, and at 9.30 the wind
suddenly sprang up from the east, cold and strong, freezing solid
all our wet clothes, and the various things on the sledge. It was
blowing a blizzard with snow and heavy drift in less than five
minutes from the time the wind started, and with difficulty we
managed to get up one tent and crawl into it, where we waited in
the hope that the weather would clear. As there was no sign of an
improvement at noon we pitched the other tent, had food, and lay
in our bags patching our worn-out clothes. All day the blizzard
has continued to blow hard, with extra violent gusts at times.
Our tents get snowed up, and we have to clear them by kicking at
the snow every now and then.</p>

<br>
<small>118. LOWER GLACIER DEPOT. THE STORES WERE BURIED IN THE
SNOW NEAR THE ROCK IN THE FOREGROUND</small></p>
<p><i>January</i> 30. We made a start at 8.15 a.m., after
spending three-quarters of an hour digging out our sledges and
tents from the drift of the blizzard, which stopped at 1 a.m. It
was clear over part of the land as we started, but soon snow
began to fall again and the weather became very thick; yet,
steering on a course, we came through the crevasses and drift
without even touching one, though before, in good light, we have
had to turn and twist to avoid them. The surface was heavy for
pulling on, owing to the fine snow from the blizzard, but we did
thirteen miles for the day, working a full ten hours till 7.50
p.m. The weather cleared right up in the afternoon, and we made a
good course. Wild is seedy to-day, but we hope that as soon as he
reaches Grisi depot he will be better. We have no variety of
food, and only have four miserably thin biscuits a day to eke out
the horse-meat. The plasmon is all finished and so are we
ourselves by the end of the day's march. The sledge also is in a
terribly bad state, but as soon as we reach the depot all will be
well. The surface in the afternoon improved, and is much better
than we had hoped for. The temperature is plus 24&deg; Fahr., fine
and warm. A heavy day's pull, but we were assisted by the wind in
the afternoon. Wild is still seedy, just walking in harness. The
surface is good, and we are rapidly nearing the depot. Short of
food, down to twenty ounces a day. Very tired. Good weather.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 31. Started at 7 a.m., Wild bad with dysentery.
Picked up mound 4 p.m., and camped at 6 p.m. Very bad surface.
Did 13| miles.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 1. Started 7 a.m.; awful surface at times.
Wild very bad. Picked up mound. Camped 6 p.m., having done nearly
fourteen miles.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 2. Started at 6.40 a.m. and camped 7 p.m. at
depot. Wild and self dysentery; dead tired, bad surface, with
undulations. Did 13| miles. Ray's birthday, celebrated with two
lumps of sugar, making five each in cocoa.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 3. Started with new sledge and 150 lb., more
weight at 8.40 a.m.; camped 5.30 p.m. Only five miles; awfully
soft snow surface. All acute dysentery due to meat. Trust that
sleep will put us right. Could go no further to-night. Wild very
bad, sell weaker, others assailed also. Bad light, short food,
surface worse than ever. Snow one foot deep. Got up 4.30 a.m.
after going to bed 11 p.m. No more to-night. Temperature plus 5&deg;
Fahr. Dull.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 4. Cannot write more. All down with acute
dysentery; terrible day. No march possible; outlook serious....
Fine weather.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 5. Eight miles to-day; dead tired. Dysentery
better, but Adams not too right. Camped at 5.30 p.m. We are
picking up the mounds well. Too weak on half ration to write
much. Still hanging on to geological specimens. Please God we
will get through all right. Great anxiety.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 6. Did ten miles to-day. All better and a
better surface. Terribly hungry. Six biscuits per day and one
pannikin horse-meat each meal. Picked up November 28 mound and
made camp. I do trust this hunger will not weaken us too much. It
has been great anxiety. Thank God the dysentery stopped and the
surface better. We may do more to-morrow, as there are signs of
wind from the south-east. Temperature plus 9&deg; Fahr.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 7. Blowing hard blizzard. Kept going till 6
p.m. Adams and Marshall renewed dysentery. Dead tired. Short
food; very weak.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 8. Did twelve miles. We had fine weather after
10 a.m. Started from camp in blizzard. Adams and Marshall still
dysentery; Wild and I all right. Feel starving for food. Talk of
it all day. Anyhow, getting north, thank God. Sixty-nine miles to
Chinaman depot.</p>

<small>119. SHACKLETON STANDING BY THE BROKEN SOUTHERN SLEDGE,
WHICH WAS REPLACED BY ANOTHER AT GRISI DEPOT</small></p>
<p><i>February</i> 9. Strong following blizzard, and did 14&frac12;
miles to north. Adams not fit yet. All thinking and talking of
food.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 10. Strong following wind. Did 20 miles 300
yards. Temperature plus 22&deg; Fahr. All thinking and talking of
food.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 11. We did 161 miles to-day, and continued to
pick up the mounds, which is a great comfort. The temperature is
plus 20&deg; Fahr. to-night. All our thoughts are of food. We ought
to reach the depot in two days. Now we are down to half a
pannikin of meat and five biscuits a day. Adams not all right
yet, and Wild shaky to-night. Good surface and following wind. We
were up at 4.45 a.m. and camped at 6 p.m.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 12. Fine day, with no wind. We were up at 4.30
a.m., and marched till 6 p.m., doing 141 miles. Adams sighted the
depot flag at 6 p.m. The temperature has ranged from plus 5&deg; to
plus 20&deg; Fahr. Passed sastrugi running south-south-east in the
afternoon. Slight westerly wind. Very tired.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 13. Breakfast at 4.40 a.m. We packed up, with
a cold wind blowing, and reached the depot, with all our food
finished, at 11.30 a.m. There we got Chinaman's liver, which we
have had to-night. It tasted splendid. We looked round for any
spare bits of meat, and while I was digging in the snow I came
across some hard red stuff. Chinaman's blood frozen into a solid
core. We dug it up, and found it a welcome addition to our food.
It was like beef tea when boiled up. The distance to-day was
twelve miles, with a light wind.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 14. A good surface to-day, but no wind. The
pulling was hard, and the temperature plus 10&deg; to plus 18&deg; Fahr.
We did ll&frac34; miles. We are still weak, but better, the horse-blood
helps. Burst lips are our greatest trouble.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 15. My birthday to-day. I was given a present
of a cigarette made out of pipe tobacco and some coarse paper we
had with us. It was delicious. A hard pull to-day, and my head is
very bad again. The distance was 12&frac14; miles, with a fairly good
surface and fine weather. We are picking up our mounds with great
regularity. The land can be seen faintly through the haze in the
distance. We have found undulations even out here, but not very
marked, running in the usual direction. Temperature minus 3&deg;
Fahr. at noon.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 16. A fair surface to-day, but no wind. The
sastrugi are disappearing. We are appallingly hungry. We are down
to about half a pannikin of half-cooked horse-meat a meal and
four biscuits a day. We covered thirteen miles to-day, with the
temperature from zero to minus 7&deg; Fahr. There are appearances of
wind from the south, long windy streamers of torn stratus. We are
so weak now that even to lift our depleted provision bag is an
effort. When we break camp in the morning we pull the tent off
the poles and take it down before we move the things inside, for
the effort of lifting the sleeping-bags, &amp;c., through the
doorway is too great. At night when we have come to camp we
sometimes have to lift our legs one at a time with both hands in
getting into the tent. It seems a severe strain to lift one's
feet without aid after we have stiffened from the day's march.
Our fingers are extremely painful. Some of us have big blisters
that burst occasionally.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 17. I thought we were in for it and was not
wrong. To-day we have been marching in a blinding blizzard, with
42&deg; of frost, but, thank heaven, the wind was behind us and we
have done nineteen miles, the sledge with the sail up often
overrunning us, and then at other times getting into a patch of
soft snow and bringing us up with a jerk. The harness round our
weakened stomachs gives us a good deal of pain when we are
brought up suddenly. We started at 6.40 a.m. and marched till 6
p.m., and to-day we had three pannikins of semi-cooked horse-meat
and six biscuits on the strength of the good march. We all have
tragic dreams of getting food to eat, but rarely have the
satisfaction of dreaming that we are actually eating. Last night
I did taste bread and butter. We look at each other as we eat our
scanty meals and feel a distinct grievance if one man manages to
make his hoosh last longer than the rest of us. Sometimes we do
our best to save a bit of biscuit for the next meal, but it is a
much debated question whether it is best to eat all the food at
once or to save. I eat all my lunch biscuit, but keep a bit from
dinner to eat in the bag so as to induce sleep. The smaller the
quantity of biscuits grows the more delicious they taste.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 18. The wind dropped during the night, and at
4.40 a.m. we got up, picked our buried sledge out of the drift,
and were under way by 7 a.m. There was little wind, and the
temperature was minus 20&deg; Fahr. at noon. This afternoon we
sighted old Discovery. What a home-like appearance it has. Its
big, bluff form showed out in the north-west, and we felt that
the same mountain might at that very moment be drawing the eyes
of our own people at winter quarters. It seemed to be a
connecting link. Perhaps they will be wondering whether we are in
sight of it.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 19. A very cold south wind to-day, but we
turned out at 4.40 a.m., with a temperature of minus 20&deg; Fahr. We
have been hungry and cold all day, but did 14&frac14; miles on a good
surface. We sighted Mount Erebus in the morning. The old
landmarks are so pleasant. Camped at 6 p.m., temperature minus
10&deg; Fahr. We ought to reach Depot A to-morrow. We have picked up
the last mound except one. If we had food all would be well, but
we are now at the end of our supplies again, except for some
scraps of meat scraped off the bones of Grisi after they had been
lying on the snow in the sun for all these months. We dare not
risk it until the worst comes. Still in five days more we ought
to be in the land of plenty.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 20. Started to get up at 4.40 a.m. It is
almost a farce to talk of getting up to "breakfast" now, and
there is no call of "Come on, boys; good hoosh". No good hoosh is
to be had. In less time than it has taken me to write this the
food is finished, and then our hopes and thoughts lie wholly in
the direction of the next feed, so called from force of habit. It
was dull and overcast to-day, and we could see only a little way.
Still we made progress, and at 4 p.m. we reached Depot A. The
distance for the day was fourteen miles, with 52&deg; of frost. We
sighted the depot at 2.30 p.m., and now we have enough food to
carry us to the Bluff Depot. We had run out of food when we
reached the depot to-day, and we have had a good hoosh to-night.
The unaccustomed pemmican fat made me feel quite queer, but I
enjoyed the pudding we made out of biscuits and the tin of jam
which we originally intended to have for Christmas Day, but which
we left behind when on the way south in order to save weight. Our
depoted tobacco and cigarettes were here, and it is difficult to
describe the enjoyment and luxury of a good smoke. I am sure that
the tobacco will make up for the shortage of food. I do not doubt
but that the Bluff Depot will have been laid all right by Joyce.
Anyhow we must stake on it, for we have not enough food to carry
us to the ship. Joyce knows his work well, and we talk now of
nothing but the feeds that we will have when we reach the Bluff.
That depot has been the bright beacon ahead through these dark
days of hunger. Each time we took in another hole in our belts we
have said that it will be all right when we get to the Bluff
Depot, and now we are getting towards it.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 21. We got up at 4.40 a.m., just as it
commenced to blow, and the wind continued all day, a blizzard
with as low as 67&deg; of frost. We could not get warm, but we did
twenty miles. In ordinary polar work one would not think of
travelling in such a severe blizzard, but our need is extreme,
and we must keep going. It is neck or nothing with us now. Our
food lies ahead, and death stalks us from behind. This is just
the time of the year when the most bad weather may be expected.
The sun now departs at night, and the darkness is palpable by the
time we turn in, generally about 9.30 p.m. We are so thin that
our bones ache as we lie on the hard snow in our sleeping-bags,
from which a great deal of the hair has gone. To-night we stewed
some of the scraps of Grisi meat, and the dish tasted delicious.
Too cold to write more. Thank God, we are nearing the Bluff.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 22. A splendid day. We did 20&frac12; miles, and on
the strength of the distance had a good feed. About 11 a.m. we
suddenly came across the tracks of a party of four men, with
dogs. Evidently the weather has been fine and they have been
moving at a good pace towards the south. We could tell that the
weather has been fine, for they were wearing ski boots instead of
finnesko, and occasionally we saw the stump of a cigarette. The
length of the steps showed that they were going fast. We are now
camped on the tracks, which are fairly recent, and we will try to
follow them to the Bluff, for they must have come from the depot.
This assures us that the depot was laid all right. I cannot
imagine who the fourth man can be, unless it was Buckley, who
might be there now that the ship is in. We passed their noon
camp, and I am certain that the ship is in, for there were tins
lying round bearing brands different from those of the original
stores. We found three small bits of chocolate and a little bit
of biscuit at the camp after carefully searching the ground for
such unconsidered trifles, and we "turned backs" for them. I was
unlucky enough to get the bit of biscuit, and a curious
unreasoning anger took possession of me for a moment at my bad
luck. It shows how primitive we have become, and how much the
question of even a morsel of food affects our judgment. We are
near the end of our food, but as we have staked everything on the
Bluff Depot, we had a good feed to-night. If we do not pick up
the depot there will be absolutely no hope for us.</p>

<br>
<h3>THE FINAL STAGE</h3>
<p><b>FEBRUARY 23</b>. Started at 6.45 a.m. in splendid weather,
and at 11 a.m., while halting for a spell, Wild saw the Bluff
Depot miraged up. It seemed to be quite close, and the flags were
waving and dancing as though to say, "Come, here I am, come and
feed." It was the most cheerful sight our eyes have ever seen,
for we had only a few biscuits left. These we at once devoured.
The Grisi meat had given Wild renewed dysentery. After a short
camp we pushed on. A flashing light appeared to be on the depot,
and when we reached it at 4 p.m., this turned out to be a biscuit
tin, which had been placed in the snow so as to catch the light
of the sun. It was like a great cheerful eye twinkling at us. The
depot had appeared much closer than it really was, because we
were accustomed to judging from the height of an ordinary depot,
whereas this one was built on a snow mound over 10 ft. high, with
two bamboos lashed together on top, and three flags. It was a
splendid mark. Joyce and his party have done their work well. Now
we are safe as regards food, and it only remains for us to reach
the ship. I climbed up on top of the depot, and shouted out to
those below of the glorious feeds that awaited us. First I rolled
down three tins of biscuits, then cases containing luxuries of
every description, many of them sent by friends. There were
Carlsbad plums, eggs, cakes, plum puddings, gingerbread and
crystallised fruit, even fresh boiled mutton from the ship. After
months of want and hunger, we suddenly found ourselves able to
have meals fit for the gods, and with appetites that the gods
might have envied. Apart from the luxuries there was an ample
supply of ordinary sledging rations. To-night we improvised a
second cooking-stand out of a biscuit tin, and used our second
primus to cook some of the courses. Our dream of food has come
true, and yet after we had eaten biscuits and had two pannikins
of pemmican, followed by cocoa, our contracted bodies would not
stand the strain of more food, and reluctantly we had to stop. I
cannot tell what a relief it has been to us. There is nothing
much in the way of news from the ship, only just a letter saying
that she had arrived on January 5, and that all was well. This
letter, dated January 20, is signed by Evans, who evidently is
the Evans who towed us down in the Koonya. We now only have to
catch the ship, and I hope we will do that. Wild is better
to-night. The temperature is plus 10&deg; Fahr., fine and warm. I am
writing in my bag with biscuits beside me, and chocolate and
jam.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 24. We got up at 5 a.m., and at 7 a.m. had
breakfast, consisting of eggs, dried milk, porridge and pemmican,
with plenty of biscuits. We marched until 1 p.m., had lunch and
then marched until 8 p.m., covering a distance of fifteen miles
for the day. The weather was fine. Though we have plenty of
weight to haul now we do not feel it so much as we did the
smaller weights when we were hungry. We have good food inside us,
and every now and then on the march we eat a bit of chocolate or
biscuit. Warned by the experience of Scott and Wilson on the
previous southern journey, I have taken care not to overeat.
Adams has a wonderful digestion, and can go on without any
difficulty. Wild's dysentery is a bit better to-day. He is
careful of his feeding and has only taken things that are
suitable. It is a comfort to be able to pick and choose. I cannot
understand a letter I received from Murray about Mackintosh
getting adrift on the ice, but no doubt this will be cleared up
on our return. Anyhow every one seems to be all right. There was
no news of the Northern Party or of the Western Party. We turned
in full of food to-night.</p>

<br>
<small>121. MARSHALL OUTSIDE A TENT, AT THE CAMP FROM WHICH
SHACKLETON AND WILD PRESSED ON TO THE SHIP</small></p>
<p><i>February</i> 25. We turned out at 4 a.m. for an early
start, as we are in danger of being left if we do not push ahead
rapidly and reach the ship. On going into the tent for breakfast
I found Marshall suffering from paralysis of the stomach and
renewed dysentery, and while we were eating a blizzard came up.
We secured everything as the Bluff showed masses of ragged cloud,
and I was of opinion that it was going to blow hard.</p>
<p>I did not think Marshall fit to travel through the blizzard.
During the afternoon, as we were lying in the bags, the weather
cleared somewhat, though it still blew hard. If Marshall is not
better to-night, I must leave him with Adams and push on, for
time is going on, and the ship may leave on March 1, according to
orders, if the Sound is not clear of ice. I went over through the
blizzard to Marshall's tent. He is in a bad way still, but thinks
that he could travel to-morrow.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 27 (1 a.m.). The blizzard was over at
midnight, and we got up at 1 a.m., had breakfast at 2, and made a
start at 4. At 9.80 a.m. we had lunch, at 3 p.m. tea, at 7 p.m.
hoosh, and then marched till 11 p.m. Had another hoosh, and
tinned in at 1 a.m. We did twenty-four miles. Marshall suffered
greatly, but stuck to the march. He never complains.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 5. Although we did not turn in until 1 a.m. on
the 27th, we were up again at 4 a.m. and after a good hoosh, we
got under way at 6 a.m. and marched until 1 p.m. Marshall was
unable to haul, his dysentery increasing, and he got worse in the
afternoon, after lunch. At 4 p.m. I decided to pitch camp, leave
Marshall under Adams' charge, and push ahead with Wild, taking
one day's provisions and leaving the balance for the two men at
the camp. I hoped to pick up a relief party at the ship We dumped
everything off the sledge except a prismatic compass, our
sleeping-bags and food for one day, and at 4.30 p.m. Wild and I
started, and marched till 9 p.m. Then we had a hoosh, and marched
until 2 a.m. of the 28th, over a very hard surface. We stopped
for one hour and a half off the north-east end of White Island,
getting no sleep, and marched till 11 a.m., by which time our
food was finished. We kept flashing the heliograph in the hope of
attracting attention from Observation Hill, where I thought that
a party would be on the lookout, but there was no return flash,
The only thing to do was to push ahead, although we were by this
time very tired. At 2.30 p.m. we sighted open water ahead, the
ice having evidently broken out four miles south of Cape
Armitage, and an hour and a half later a blizzard wind started to
blow, and the weather got very thick. We thought once that we saw
a party coming over to meet us, and our sledge seemed to grow
lighter for a few minutes, but the "party" turned out to be a
group of penguins at the ice-edge. The weather was so thick that
we could not see any distance ahead, and we arrived at the ice
edge suddenly. The ice was swaying up and down, and there was
grave risk of our being carried out. I decided to abandon the
sledge, as I felt sure that we would get assistance at once when
we reached the hut, and time was becoming important. It was
necessary that we should get food and shelter speedily. Wild's
feet were giving him a great deal of trouble. In the thick
weather we could not risk making Pram Point, and I decided to
follow another route seven miles round by the other side of
Castle Rock. We clambered over crevasses and snow slopes, and
after what seemed an almost interminable struggle reached Castle
Rock, from whence I could see that there was open water all round
the north. It was indeed a different homecoming from what we had
expected. Out on the Barrier and up on the plateau our thoughts
had often turned to the day when we would get back to the comfort
and plenty of the winter quarters, but we had never imagined
fighting our way to the back door, so to speak, in such a
cheerless fashion. We reached the top of Ski Slope at 7.45 p.m.,
and from there we could see the hut and the bay. There was no
sign of the ship, and no smoke or other evidence of life at the
hut. &gt; We hurried on to the hut, our minds busy with gloomy
possibilities, and found not a man there. There was a letter
stating that the Northern Party had reached the Magnetic Pole,
and that all the parties had been picked up except ours. The
letter added that the ship would be sheltering under Glacier
Tongue until February 26. It was now February 28, and it was with
very keen anxiety in our minds that we proceeded to search for
food. If the ship was gone, our plight, and that of the two men
left out on the Barrier, was a very serious one.</p>

<br>
<small>123. THE START OF THE RELIEF PARTY, WHICH BROUGHT IN ADAMS
AND MARSHALL</small></p>
<p>We improvised a cooking vessel, found oil and a Primus lamp,
and had a good feed of biscuit, onions and plum pudding, which
were amongst the stores left at the hut. We were utterly weary,
but we had no sleeping-gear, our bags having been left with the
sledge, and the temperature was very low. We found a piece of
roofing felt, which we wrapped round us, and then we sat up all
night, the darkness being relieved only when we occasionally
lighted the lamp in order to secure a little warmth. We tried to
burn the magnetic hut in the hope of attracting attention from
the ship, but we were not able to get it alight. We tried, too,
to tie the Union Jack to Vince's cross, on the hill, but we were
so played out that our cold fingers could not manage the knots.
It was a bad night for us, and we were glad indeed when the light
came again. Then we managed to get a little warmer, and at 9 a.m.
we got the magnetic hut alight, and put up the flag. All our
fears vanished when in the distance we saw the ship, miraged up.
We signalled with the heliograph, and at 11 a.m. on March 1 we
were on board the <i>Nimrod</i> and once more safe amongst
friends. I will not attempt to describe our feelings. Every one
was glad to see us, and keen to know what we had done. They had
given us up for lost, and a search-party had been going to start
that day in the hope of finding some trace of us. I found that
every member of the expedition was well, that the plans had
worked out satisfactorily, and that the work laid down had been
carried out. The ship had brought nothing but good news from the
outside world. It seemed as though a great load had been lifted
from my shoulders.</p>

<br>
<small>124. THE <i>NIMROD</i> AT FRAM POINT ON MARCH 4,
1909</small></p>
<p>The first thing was to bring in Adams and Marshall, and I
ordered out a relief party at once. I had a good feed of bacon
and fried bread, and started at 2.30 p.m. from the Barrier edge
with Mackay, Mawson and McGillan, leaving Wild on the
<i>Nimrod</i>. We marched until 10 p.m., had dinner and turned in
for a short sleep. We were up again at 2 a.m. the next morning
(March 2), and travelled until 1 p.m., when we reached the camp
where I had left the two men. Marshall was better, the rest
having done him a lot of good, and he was able to march and pull.
After lunch we started back again, and marched until 8 p.m. in
fine weather. We were under way again at 4 a.m. the next morning,
had lunch at noon, and reached the ice-edge at 3 p.m. There was
no sign of the ship, and the sea was freezing over. We waited
until 5 p.m., and then found that it was possible to strike land
at Pram Point. The weather was coming on bad, clouding up from
the south-east, and Marshall was suffering from renewed
dysentery, the result of the heavy marching. We therefore
abandoned one tent and one sledge at the ice-edge, taking on only
the sleeping-bags and the specimens. We climbed up by Crater
Hill, leaving everything but the sleeping-bags, for the weather
was getting worse, and at 9.35 p.m. commenced to slide down
towards Hut Point. We reached the winter quarters at 9.50, and
Marshall was put to bed. Mackay and I lighted a carbide flare on
the hill by Vince's cross, and after dinner all hands turned in
except Mackay and myself. A short time after Mackay saw the ship
appear. It was now blowing a hard blizzard, but Mackintosh had
seen our flare from a distance of nine miles. Adams and I went on
board the <i>Nimrod</i>, and Adams, after surviving all the
dangers of the interior of the Antarctic continent, was nearly
lost within sight of safety. He slipped at the ice-edge, owing to
the fact that he was wearing new finnesko, and he only just saved
himself from going over. He managed to hang on until he was
rescued by a party from the ship.</p>
<p>A boat went back for Marshall and the others, and we were all
safe on board at 1 a.m. on March 4.</p>
<blockquote>Note. Subsequent calculations have shown that the
distances given in my diary of the southern journey were not
always quite accurate. The calculations were made under
circumstances of special difficulty, and were not checked until
after my return to civilisation. The reader will notice that some
of the distances are given in statute miles and others in
geographical miles. After the last meridian altitude was taken at
the plateau depot and until the return to the same depot the
distances were noted in geographical miles. I have thought it
best to let the diary figures stand, but in the construction of
the map certain corrections have been made, and at the end of the
book will be found a table showing the actual distances travelled
day by day.</blockquote>
