<h4>Published in The Mail, Adelaide, S.A., Saturday 7 August, 1948.</h4>
<hr>
<br>
<p>Now there could he no doubt his Right Reverence, Matthew Bossington-Brown,
Bishop of Mungalatoo, was of a decided and masterful personality. Of strong
evangelistic principles, he ruled his diocese, if not with the proverbial rod
of iron, at least with a rod of the new plastic material in every way as hard
and unbending. He exacted an implicit obedience from all his clergy, and woe
betide one who wanted to wear a biretta, officiate in too ornate vestments, or
indulge in any practices he considered to be too ritualistic in their
tendencies.</p>
<p>His powers of organisation were excellent; he allowed no slackness; at all
times he was grimly determined to make his denomination a vital force in the
community. A strict moralist, he was old-fashioned in many of his ideas. He
hated to see women smoking, he disapproved strongly of lip-stick, a painted
face was his abomination. He thought short skirts cheapening to the sex and,
indeed, all attenuated garments found ill-favor in his sight. Out of step with
the latter-day world, he nevertheless practised all he preached, and,
accordingly, if not particularly well-liked, he was greatly respected. With no
children, he was married to a prim and rather austere-looking woman a few years
older than himself.</p>
<p>In the early sixties, in appearance, Mr. Bishop was tall and gaunt. He had
big fierce eyes under bushy brows and was clean-shaven except for well-trimmed
short whiskers. He was always impeccably dressed as if he had just come
straight from his clerical tailor.</p>
<p>One hot and sultry Monday morning he set out in his car to return home from
a weekend spent in a small town some 200 miles up-country. He had been holding
confirmation and it could not be said everything had gone off to his
satisfaction. There should, he thought, have been more candidates to be
confirmed, the offertories should have been larger, and altogether that the
vicar was not zealous enough in his work. Apart from church matters, too, the
arrangements made for his stay at the vicarage had not pleased him.</p>
<p>The cooking had been bad and given him indigestion, the table manners of the
vicar's seven offspring had been disgusting, and, worst of all, the vicar's
pigs had greatly annoyed him. Their sty was unduly close to the house, and not
only did their fearsome odor penetrate strongly up to his bedroom, but also
their grunting and snorting had kept him awake the greater part of the
night.</p>
<p>On the Sunday morning he had complained about the horrid animals and been
assured they should trouble him no more the next night, as they had been
removed to a shed some distance away. However, the brutes had somehow managed
to escape, and, unawed by the episcopal wrath, long before it was light had
begun rooting noisily in the flower bed actually under his very window. There
had been no more sleep for him then. The only consolation he had had was in
realising what havoc the pigs must have made in the vicarage garden.</p>
<p>Irritable and cross, the bishop was very glad to say good-bye after
breakfast, though it was certainly a dreadful morning to be starting upon his
long journey back home. Not a breath of air was stirring, and, though no sun
was shining, the heat was terrific. The sky was black and low, and he had been
warned to get on to the bitumen, nearly 100 miles away, as quickly as possible,
as there were all signs of a big rain developing.</p>
<p>A few miles upon his journey he was in a bath of perspiration from head to
foot, and his clerical attire was altogether too much for him. So, the road
being lonely and unfrequented, he pulled up his car and stripped off his outer
garments, collar, episcopal gaiters, and all. These he folded tidily and thrust
in his suitcase, donning in their stead a pair of rather oily overalls, which
he always carried with him in case he had to change a tyre, and a light
dustcoat which he buttoned up to his chin. Thus attired, he told himself he
looked anything but the high and important church dignitary he was. But he did
not expect to have to get out of the car again until he had driven it right
into his own garage.</p>
<p>Much more comfortable now, he was making quick progress until a few miles
farther on, when a man, standing by a stationary car, hailed him, and he had to
stop. The man said his car had broken down and might take a long time to put
right, so would the bishop very kindly give a lift to a young woman passenger
as far as a railway station, about 10 miles up the road.</p>
<p>The bishop looked at the young woman who had now got out of the stranded
car. His immediate impression was by no means a pleasant one. She was of the
type he so disliked, very short-skirted, all painted up, and with an impudent
smile upon her pert little face. Of course, he could not refuse, however, and
so her suitcase was bundled into the back of the car next to his own, and with
all the assurance in the world she took her seat beside him.</p>
<p>As he had surmised from her appearance, there was nothing backward about the
young woman. She started at once to open up a lively and intimate conversation,
at least on her side, as the bishop spoke as little as he could. Presently, she
remarked she loved dancing, and asked him if he did not, too.</p>
<p>"And how do you know I have ever danced at all?" he asked with a frown.</p>
<p>"Of course you have," she giggled. "I'll bet you've been a gay old dog in
your time. You look like one now," and she went on to expatiate upon the many
dances she had been to, and the good times she had had with her boys. The
bishop was scandalised, and devoutly thankful when the railway station was
reached and he could drop her and her suitcase.</p>
<p>Then, only a few miles farther on, his troubles began. The skies opened and
the rain came down, almost in a solid sheet of water so it seemed. Very soon
the car began to slither and slide, and the bishop had the greatest difficulty
in keeping to the road. Every minute the going got worse and worse, and in the
two ensuing hours he barely made 30 miles. Twice he got stuck, and with
difficulty extricated himself in reverse and went on again.</p>
<p>At length, just as he was realising he would not be able to plough his way
through the heavy going much longer, he saw a small hotel just beyond a wide
sheet of water covering the entire breadth of the road. He thought it was
impossible for him to get through, but, accelerating fiercely, he just managed
it, and drew up in a state of exhaustion before the hotel door.</p>
<p>Quite a number of people on the hotel verandah had been watching him and
shouting encouragement to come on, with one of them, he saw, taking snaps of
him as he arrived. The landlord of the hotel came forward and told him where
his car should be parked.</p>
<p>"You're lucky I can give you a room," said the man. "I've got a crowd stuck
up here already and you're about the last I can take in."</p>
<p>"But I only want to stop until the rain is over," frowned the bishop, "I
hope to go on again this afternoon."</p>
<p>"You won't do that," laughed the man grimly, "and I shouldn't like to say
when the roads'll be fit for motors again. We've been having tremendous rain.
Some of the telephone poles are already down and we're cut off from everywhere.
What is your name?" He caught the last syllable. "Then come in, Mr. Brown, I'll
show you to your room." Carrying his suit case, the bishop followed him to the
back of the building.</p>
<p>Left to himself, the bishop took off his dustcoat with the intention, after
a good wash, of resuming his clerical clothes. Then, suddenly, he smelt a
peculiar odor, one he had smelt so often upon hot evenings in the cathedral,
the smell of face powder and scent.</p>
<p>It seemed to come from the direction of his suitcase which he had thrown
upon the bed. Very puzzled, he proceeded to undo the straps. Throwing back the
lid, right on the top was a woman's nightdress, blue with dainty pink ribbons.
Not crediting the evidence of his eyes, he snatched up the garment, and to his
horror came upon two pairs of scanties underneath. He knew what they were
instantly from the obscene advertisements of certain city departmental stores
which had often caught his eyes in the daily newspapers.</p>
<p>His breath almost choked as he realised what had happened. He had given that
horrid girl his suitcase instead of hers. They were so much alike, and in his
haste to get rid of her he could understand the mistake. Great heavens! then he
was landed among strange people in this awful little public house with nothing
but the things he stood up in&mdash;no clerical clothes, no shaving apparatus,
no comb or hairbrush, nothing at all!</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1202411h-images/1202411h-02.jpg" width="214" height="378" alt=
""></p>
<p>But his equanimity soon returned. It was most annoying, but really what did
it matter? He would have to go on wearing just what he had got on, but in all
probability, among the other people held up in the hotel his attire would be
nothing out of the way. They would be just country folk who were accustomed to
go about in anything and, not crediting the hotel-keeper's gloomy forecast of
the weather, it might be only for a few hours and he would be off again in the
morning. He would tell no one who he was, and so far from the city,
particularly as he was not in clerical clothes, it was hardly likely he would
be recognised. He would not say anything about the changed suitcases either,
because if it got in the newspapers it might easily bring ridicule upon the
cloth.</p>
<p>The midday meal was taken at a long table in the crowded little dining room.
There were 10 others there, and though some of them were well dressed, as he
had expected, they looked just very ordinary people, and not of the cultured
class. He was just given a general good-day, and then no one took any more
notice of him. He made no attempt to join in the conversation as it didn't
interest him, being all about the splendid rain, crops, the price of sheep, and
horse racing.</p>
<p>He spent a very boring afternoon, looking out of the window at the still
pouring rain. There appeared to be no books in the hotel, no reading matter at
all except some out-of-date daily newspapers. Some of the others played cards,
but not being a card player, he did not join in. To the few remarks made to
him, he gave only curt responses, and continued to be left alone.</p>
<p>One of the other people staying there was a stout, red-faced man, who, the
landlord whispered, was one of the most important men in the State, "Sid
Stevens, our biggest bookmaker! You could win a couple of thousand from him and
he wouldn't turn a hair," the landlord said. The bishop sighed deeply as he
thought of the public estimation of the values of the various services rendered
to them.</p>
<p>The next morning the rain was still falling, and the hotel was now
surrounded by a wide belt of water. It was an uncomfortable day for the bishop.
He was unkempt and unshaven because, fearful of infection, he would not beg the
loan of a razor from anyone. He knew from their covert glances in his direction
that some of the other guests were becoming curious about him. He was quite
aware his was a face which looked shocking when he had not shaved, even for one
day.</p>
<p>That evening came a dreadful happening. For a few minutes the bishop
experienced perhaps the most worried moments of his life.</p>
<p>They had just sat down to the evening meal when the last to arrive was a
flashy, overdressed woman, whose make-up had often offended the bishop's eye.
She came in with a white and frightened face, closely followed by the landlord.
The latter pushed to the door behind him and announced hoarsely, "Ladies and
gentlemen, a dreadful thing has happened in my hotel. Someone has stolen this
lady's pearl necklace, which she values at &pound;700. We have a thief among us
here."</p>
<p>A startled silence filled the room. All eyes were upon the landlord. He went
on sternly. "Yes, I regret to say the thief must be one of you here. It is
impossible my wife or I could have taken the necklace, and our two helps are my
cousins, and have been with me for more than 10 years. Also&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"One moment," broke in the bookmaker, sharply, "when was the necklace
stolen?"</p>
<p>"It must have been this afternoon," said the owner of the necklace, almost
in tears. "I saw it in the drawer in my wardrobe just after lunch, and 10
minutes ago I found it had gone."</p>
<p>The landlord went on. "Now, no one from outside the hotel can have taken it,
because the floodwaters would have prevented anyone getting near the place." He
looked most distressed. "So I must ask you all to allow yourselves and your
luggage to be searched."</p>
<p>"Well, that's simple," said a commercial traveller, "and no one can
object."</p>
<p>The bishop went icy cold in horror. Search the suitcase in his room and find
him in possession of those awful female garments! Suppose it came out later who
he was and the newspapers got hold of the story&mdash;what a disgrace it would
be to the church!</p>
<p>He spoke up quickly, to scotch the idea at once. "Nonsense," he exclaimed,
"the necklace can't have been taken! The lady has just mislaid it. Let her look
again." His voice was firm. "I, for one, refuse to be searched."</p>
<p>Everyone looked astounded and several called out at once, "But why not?"</p>
<p>"Because," said the bishop coldly&mdash;he looked round scornfully&mdash;"I
am a clergyman and the search would be degrading to my cloth."</p>
<p>A moment's gasp of astonishment, and the atmosphere of the room became
almost hilarious. What, this unshaven, unkempt fellow a clergyman! This
grubby-looking extraordinary dressed individual a&mdash;&mdash;!</p>
<p>"Unfrocked?" asked one man, trying to be funny.</p>
<p>"Test him out," cried another. "Let him say the Ten Commandments."</p>
<p>The bishop's face was black with anger, but what his retort would have been
will never be known, for the door burst open and the landlord's wife came
running quickly into the room. "It's found!" she exclaimed excitedly. "My
little girl&mdash;she's only three&mdash;had taken it to bed with her. Oh, I'm
so sorry."</p>
<p>It was some minutes before anyone had quietened down, except the bishop, who
had at once calmly resumed his soup. The bookmaker spoke up smilingly. "Look
here," he said, indicating the bishop, "whoever this gentleman may be, some of
us have not been over-polite to him, and I should like to make some amends." He
raised his voice. "Landlord, bring half a dozen bottles of your best
champagne." The commercial traveller led the applause which followed.</p>
<p>The bishop had full command of the occasion. "And let this be a lesson to
you good people," he said, in his best pontifical manner, "not to judge anyone
by appearances. You see me as I am now, because, unhappily, I lost my luggage
in that storm." And that was all they could get out of him, even after two
glasses of champagne.</p>
<p>The rain stopped at last and a strong, drying wind sprang up. With all
prospects of resuming his journey the following afternoon, the bishop thought
his troubles were practically over. Alas, however, another bad one was yet
come. In the morning after breakfast all the marooned travellers were standing
about on the verandah, rejoicing in a hot sun which was quickly drying up the
roads, when a horse and trap with four people headed past the hotel.</p>
<p>Suddenly an excited voice called shrilly, "Stop, stop, there's the old guy
who went off with my beautiful nightie and all my other things." The bishop, to
his horror, realised the voice came from the girl whose suitcase he had got in
his room.</p>
<p>Very red in the face, he brought the suitcase out, but the excited girl
would insist upon opening it then and there in front of them all to make sure
her belongings were intact. In a loud voice and to a highly interested
audience, she proceeded to relate what had happened. However, she accompanied
the explanation with so many nods and grins that several of those present were
half inclined to believe she was not telling the whole story.</p>
<p>Then, to crown all, the man who had been driving the trap, after staring
hard at the bishop for some minutes, suddenly recognised him and addressed him
by name. He assured him that the episcopal suitcase was quite safe and at a
certain railway station all ready to be despatched to the city. The hotel
guests were staggered, but several of them were quick to try to make out to one
another that all along they had thought the ill-dressed stranger was no
ordinary man.</p>
<p>THE poor bishop arrived home that evening, devoutly hoping nothing of his
adventure would become public property. Alas, it did, and the following week
the issue of a scandal-loving newspaper proceeded to entertain its readers with
a spicy story of a highly placed ecclesiastic&mdash;it mentioned no
name&mdash;who was found in possession of certain most intimate female garments
upon arriving solo at a country hotel.</p>
<p>The bishop was certain everyone guessed who the ecclesiastic was, and, in
consequence, was by no means gratified at the large congregations which, for
many weeks after, gathered in every church where it had been announced he was
going to preach.</p>
