<p class="first">THE usual little crowd was waiting in the lobby
of a fashionable London restaurant a few minutes before the
popular luncheon hour. Pamela Van Teyl, a very beautiful
American girl, dressed in the extreme of fashion, which she
seemed somehow to justify, directed the attention of her
companions to the notice affixed to the wall facing them.</p>

<p>"Except," she declared, "for you poor dears who have been
hurt, that is the first thing I have seen in England which makes
me realise that you are at war."</p>

<p>The younger of her two escorts, Captain Richard Holderness,
who wore the uniform of a well-known cavalry regiment, glanced
at the notice a little impatiently.</p>

<p>"What rot it seems!" he exclaimed. "We get fed up with that
sort of thing in France. It's always the same at every little
railway station and every little inn. 'M&eacute;fiez-vous!
Taisez-vous!' They might spare us over here."</p>

<p>John Lutchester, a tall, clean-shaven man, dressed in
civilian clothes, raised his eyeglass and read out the notice
languidly.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," he observed. "Some of you Service
fellows&mdash;not the Regulars, of course&mdash;do gas a good
deal when you come back. I don't suppose you any of you know
anything, so it doesn't really matter," he added, glancing at
his watch.</p>

<p>"Army's full of Johnnies, who come from God knows where
nowadays," Holderness assented gloomily. "No wonder they can't
keep their mouths shut."</p>

<p>"Seems to me you need them all," Miss Pamela Van Teyl
remarked with a smile.</p>

<p>"Of course we do," Holderness assented, "and Heaven forbid
that any of us Regulars should say a word against them. Jolly
good stuff in them, too, as the Germans found out last
month."</p>

<p>"All the same," Lutchester continued, still studying the
notice, "news does run over London like quicksilver. If you step
down to the American bar here, for instance, you'll find that
Charles is one of the best-informed men about the war in London.
He has patrons in the Army, in the Navy, and in the Flying
Corps, and it's astonishing how communicative they seem to
become after the second or third cocktail."</p>

<p>"Cocktail, mark you, Miss Van Teyl," Holderness pointed out.
"We poor Englishmen could keep our tongues from wagging before
we acquired some of your American habits."</p>

<p>"The habits are all right," Pamela retorted. "It's your heads
that are wrong."</p>

<p>"The most valued product of your country," Lutchester
murmured, "is more dangerous to our hearts than to our
heads."</p>

<p>She made a little grimace and turned away, holding out her
hand to a new arrival&mdash;a tall, broad-shouldered man, with a
strong, cold face and keen, grey eyes, aggressive even behind
his gold-rimmed spectacles. There was a queer change in his face
as his eyes met Pamela's. He seemed suddenly to become more
human. His pleasure at seeing her was certainly more than the
usual transatlantic politeness.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fischer," she exclaimed, "they are saying hard things
about our country! Please protect me."</p>

<p>He bowed over her fingers. Then he looked up. His tone was
impressive.</p>

<p>"If I thought that you needed protection, Miss Van
Teyl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I can assure you that I do," she interrupted,
laughing. "You know my friends, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I think I have that pleasure," the American replied, shaking
hands with Lutchester and Holderness.</p>

<p>"Now we'll get an independent opinion," the former observed,
pointing to the wall. "We were discussing that notice, Mr.
Fischer. You're almost as much a Londoner as a New Yorker. What
do you think?&mdash;is it superfluous or not?"</p>

<p>Fischer read it out and smiled.</p>

<p>"Well," he admitted, "in America we don't lay much store by
that sort of thing, but I don't know as we're very good judges
about what goes on over here. I shouldn't call this place,
anyway, a hotbed of intrigue. Excuse me!"</p>

<p>He moved off to greet some incoming guests&mdash;a well-known
stockbroker and his partner. Lutchester looked after him
curiously.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Fischer one of your typical millionaires, Miss Van
Teyl?" he asked.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"We have no typical millionaires," she assured him. "They
come from all classes and all States."</p>

<p>"Fischer is a Westerner, isn't he?"</p>

<p>Pamela nodded, but did not pursue the conversation. Her eyes
were fixed upon a girl who had just entered, and who was looking
a little doubtfully around, a girl plainly but smartly dressed,
with fluffy light hair, dark eyes, and a very pleasant
expression. Pamela, who was critical of her own sex, found the
newcomer attractive.</p>

<p>"Is that, by any chance, one of our missing guests, Captain
Holderness?" she inquired, turning towards him. "I don't know
why, but I have an idea that it is your sister."</p>

<p>"By Jove, yes!" the young man assented, stepping forward.
"Here we are, Molly, and at last you are going to meet Miss Van
Teyl. I've bored Molly stiff, talking about you," he explained,
as Pamela held out her hand.</p>

<p>The girls, who stood talking together for a moment, presented
rather a striking contrast. Molly Holderness was pretty but
usual. Pamela was beautiful and unusual. She had the long, slim
body of a New York girl, the complexion and eyes of a
Southerner, the <i>savoir faire</i> of a Frenchwoman. She was
extraordinarily cosmopolitan, and yet extraordinarily American.
She impressed every one, as she did Molly Holderness at that
moment, with a sense of charm. One could almost accept as truth
her own statement&mdash;that she valued her looks chiefly
because they helped people to forget that she had brains.</p>

<p>"I won't admit that I have ever been bored, Miss Van Teyl,"
Molly Holderness assured her, "but Dick has certainly told me
all sorts of wonderful things about you&mdash;how kind you were
in New York, and what a delightful surprise it was to see you
down at the hospital at Nice. I am afraid he must have been a
terrible crock then."</p>

<p>"Got well in no time as soon as Miss Van Teyl came along,"
Holderness declared. "It was a bit dreary down there at first.
None of my lot were sent south, and a familiar face means a good
deal when you've got your lungs full of that rotten gas and are
feeling like nothing on earth. I wonder where that idiot Sandy
is. I told him to be here a quarter of an hour before you
others&mdash; thought we might have had a quiet chat first. Will
you stand by the girls for a moment, Lutchester, while I have a
look round?" he added.</p>

<p>He hobbled away, one of the thousands who were thronging the
streets and public places of London&mdash;brave, simple-minded
young men, all of them, with tangled recollections in their
brains of blood and fire and hell, and a game leg or a lost arm
to remind them that the whole thing was not a nightmare. He
looked a little disconsolately around, and was on the point of
rejoining the others when the friend for whom he was searching
came hurriedly through the turnstile doors.</p>

<p>"Sandy, old chap," Holderness exclaimed, with an air of
relief, "here you are at last!"</p>

<p>"Cheero, Dick!" was the light-hearted reply. "Fearfully sorry
I'm late, but listen&mdash;just listen for one moment."</p>

<p>The newcomer threw his hat and coat to the attendant. He was
a rather short, freckled young man, with a broad, high forehead
and light-coloured hair. His eyes just now were filled with the
enthusiasm which trembled in his tone.</p>

<p>"Dick," he continued, gripping his friend's arm tightly, "I'm
late, I know, but I've great news. I've motored straight up from
Salisbury Plain. I've done it! I swear to you, Dick, I've done
it!"</p>

<p>"Done what?" Holderness demanded, a little bewildered.</p>

<p>"I've perfected my explosive&mdash;the thing I was telling
you about last week," was the triumphant reply. "The whole
world's struggling for it, Dick. The German chemists have been
working night and day for three years, just for one little
formula, and I've got it! One of my shells, which fell in a wood
at daylight this morning, killed every living thing within a
mile of it. The bark fell off the trees, and the labourers in a
field beyond threw down their implements and ran for their
lives. It's the principle of intensification. The poison feeds
on its own vapours. The formula&mdash;I've got it in my
pocket-book&mdash; "</p>

<p>"Look here, old fellow," Holderness interrupted, "it's all
splendid, of course, and I'm dying to hear you talk about it,
but come along now and be introduced to Miss Van Teyl. Molly's
over there, waiting, and we're all half starved."</p>

<p>"So am I," was the cheerful answer. "Hullo, Lutchester, how
are you? Just one moment. I must get a wash, I motored straight
through, and I'm choked with dust. Where do I go?"</p>

<p>"I'll show you," Lutchester volunteered. "Hurry up."</p>

<p>The two men sprang up the stairs towards the dressing-room,
and Holderness strolled back to where his sister and Pamela were
talking to a small, dark young man, with rather high cheek-bones
and olive complexion. Pamela turned around with a smile.</p>

<p>"I have found an old friend," she told him. "Baron
Sunyea&mdash;Captain Holderness. Baron Sunyea used to be in the
Japanese Embassy at Washington."</p>

<p>The two men shook hands.</p>

<p>"I was interested," the Japanese said slowly, "in your
conversation just now about that notice. Your young friend was
telling you news very loudly indeed, it seemed to me, which you
would not like known across the North Sea. Am I not right?"</p>

<p>"In a sense you are, of course," Holderness admitted, "but
here at Henry's&mdash; why, the place is like a club. Where are
the enemies' ears to come from, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"Where we least expect to find them, as a rule," was the
grave reply.</p>

<p>"Quite right," Lutchester, who had just rejoined them,
agreed. "They still say, you know, that our home Secret Service
is just as bad as our foreign Secret Service is good."</p>

<p>Holderness smiled in somewhat superior fashion.</p>

<p>"Can't say that I have much faith in that spy talk," he
declared. "No doubt there was any quantity of espionage before
the war, but it's pretty well weeded out now. I say, how good
civilisation is!" he went on, his eyes dwelling lovingly on the
interior of the restaurant. "Tophole, isn't it,
Lutchester&mdash; these smart girls, with their furs and violets
and perfumes, the little note of music in the distance, the
cheerful clatter of plates, the smiling faces of the waiters,
and the undercurrent of pleasant voices. Don't laugh at me,
please, Miss Van Teyl. I've three weeks more of it, by
George&mdash;perhaps more. I don't go up before my Board till
Thursday fortnight. Dash it, I wish Sandy would hurry up!"</p>

<p>"You never told me how you got your wound," Pamela observed,
as the conversation flagged for a moment.</p>

<p>"Can't even remember," was the careless reply. "We were all
scrapping away as hard as we could one afternoon, and nearly a
dozen of us got the knock, all at the same time. It's quite all
right now, though, except for the stiffness. It was the gas did
me in.... What a fellow Sandy is! You people must be
starving."</p>

<p>They waited for another five minutes. Then Holderness limped
towards the stairs with a little imprecation. Lutchester stopped
him.</p>

<p>"Don't you go, Holderness," he begged. "I'll find him and
bring him down by the scruff of the neck."</p>

<p>He strode up the stairs on a mission which ended in
unexpected failure. Presently he returned, a slight frown upon
his forehead.</p>

<p>"I am awfully sorry," he announced, "but I can't find him
anywhere. I left him washing his hands, and he said he'd be down
in a moment. Are you quite sure that we haven't missed him?"</p>

<p>"There hasn't been a sign of him," Molly declared promptly.
"I am so hungry that my eyes have been glued upon the staircase
all the time."</p>

<p>Pamela, who had slipped away a few moments before, rejoined
them with a little expression of surprise.</p>

<p>"Isn't Captain Graham here yet?" she asked incredulously.</p>

<p>"Not a sign of him," Holderness replied. "Queer set out,
isn't it? We won't wait a moment longer. Take my sister and Miss
Van Teyl in, will you?" he went on, laying his hand on
Lutchester's shoulder. "Ferrani will look after you. I'll follow
directly."</p>

<p>The chief <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> advanced to meet them with a gesture
of invitation, and led them to a table arranged for five. The
restaurant was crowded, and the coloured band, from the space
against the wall on their left, was playing a lively one-step.
Ferrani was buttonholed by an important client as they crossed
the threshold, and they lingered for a moment, waiting for his
guidance. Whilst they stood there, a curious thing happened. The
leader of the orchestra seemed to draw his fingers recklessly
across the strings of his instrument and to produce a discord
which was almost appalling. A half-pained, half-amused
exclamation rippled down the room. For a moment the music
ceased. The conductor, who was responsible for the disturbance,
was sitting motionless, his hand hanging down by his side. His
features remained imperturbable, but the gleam of his white
teeth, and a livid little streak under his eyes gave to his
usually good-humoured face an utterly altered, almost a
malignant expression. Ferrani stepped across and spoke to him
for a moment angrily. The man took up his instrument, waved his
hand, and the music re-commenced in a subdued note. Pamela
turned to the chief <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, who had now re-joined
them.</p>

<p>"What an extraordinary breakdown!" she exclaimed. "Is your
leader a man of nerves?"</p>

<p>"Never have I heard such a thing in all my days," Ferrani
assured them fervently. "Joseph is one of the most wonderful
performers in the world. His control over his instrument is
marvellous.... Captain Holderness asked particularly for this
table."</p>

<p>They seated themselves at the table reserved for them against
the wall. Their cicerone was withdrawing with a low bow, but
Pamela leaned over to speak to him.</p>

<p>"Your music," she told him, "is quite wonderful. The
orchestra consists entirely of Americans, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Entirely, madam," Ferrani assented. "They are real Southern
darkies, from Joseph, the leader, down to little Peter, who
blows the motor-horn."</p>

<p>Pamela's interest in the matter remained unabated.</p>

<p>"I tell you it makes one feel almost homesick to hear them
play," she went on, with a little sigh. "Did they come direct
from the States?"</p>

<p>Ferrani shook his head.</p>

<p>"From Paris, madam. Before that, for a little time, they were
at the Winter Garden in Berlin. They made quite a European tour
of it before they arrived here."</p>

<p>"And he is the leader&mdash;the man whom you call Joseph,"
Pamela observed. "A broad, good-humoured face&mdash;not much
intelligence, I should imagine."</p>

<p>Ferrani's protest was vigorous and gesticulatory. He
evidently had ideas of his own concerning Joseph.</p>

<p>"More, perhaps, than you would think, madam," he declared.
"He knows how to make a bargain, believe me. It cost us more
than I would like to tell you to get these fellows here."</p>

<p>Pamela looked him in the eyes.</p>

<p>"Be careful, Monsieur Ferrani," she advised, "that it does
not cost you more to get rid of them."</p>

<p>She leaned back in her place, apparently tired of the
subject, and Ferrani, a little puzzled, made his bow and
withdrew. The music was once more in full swing. Their luncheon
was served, and Lutchester did his best to entertain his
companions. Their eyes, however, every few seconds strayed
towards the door. There was no sign of the missing guest.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="first">MOLLY HOLDERNESS, for whom Graham's absence
possessed, perhaps, more significance than the others, relapsed
very soon into a strained and anxious silence. Pamela and
Lutchester, on the other hand, divided their attention between a
very excellent luncheon and an even flow of personal, almost
inquisitorial conversation.</p>

<p>"You will find," Pamela warned her companion almost as they
took their places, "that I am a very curious person. I am more
interested in people than in events. Tell me something about
your work at the War Office?"</p>

<p>"I am not at the War Office," he replied.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it that you do, then?" she asked. "Captain
Holderness told me that you had been out in France, fighting,
but that you had some sort of official position at home
now."</p>

<p>"I am at the Ministry of Munitions," he explained.</p>

<p>"Well, tell me about that, then?" she suggested. "Is it as
exciting as fighting?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"It has advantages," he admitted, "but I should scarcely say
that excitement figured amongst them."</p>

<p>She looked at him thoughtfully. Lutchester was a little over
thirty-five years of age, tall and of sinewy build. His
colouring was neutral, his complexion inclined to be pale, his
mouth straight and firm, his grey eyes rather deep-set. Without
possessing any of the stereotyped qualifications, he was
sufficiently good-looking.</p>

<p>"I wonder you didn't prefer soldiering," she observed.</p>

<p>He smiled for a moment, and Pamela felt unreasonably annoyed
at the twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I am not a soldier by profession," he said, "but I went out
with the Expeditionary Force and had a year of it. They kept me
here, after a slight wound, to take up my old work again."</p>

<p>"Your old work," she repeated. "I didn't know there was such
a thing as a Ministry of Munitions before the war."</p>

<p>He deliberately changed the conversation, directing Pamela's
attention to the crowded condition of the room.</p>

<p>"Gay scene, isn't it?" he remarked.</p>

<p>"Very!" she assented drily.</p>

<p>"Do you come here to dance?" he inquired.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"You must remember that I have been living in Paris for some
months," she told him. "You won't be annoyed if I tell you that
the way you English people are taking the war simply maddens me.
Your young soldiers talk about it as though it were a sort of
picnic, your middle-aged clubmen seem to think that it was
invented to give them a fresh interest in their newspapers, and
the rest of you seem to think of nothing but the money you are
making. And Paris.... No, I don't think I should care to dance
here!"</p>

<p>Lutchester nodded, but Pamela fancied somehow or other that
his attitude was not wholly sympathetic. His tone, with its
slight note of admonition, irritated her.</p>

<p>"You must be careful," he said, "not to be too much misled by
externals."</p>

<p>Pamela opened her lips for a quick reply, but checked
herself.</p>

<p>Captain Holderness and Ferrani had entered the room and were
approaching their table, talking earnestly. The latter
especially was looking perplexed and anxious.</p>

<p>"It's the queerest thing I ever knew," Holderness pronounced.
"We've searched every hole and corner upstairs, and there isn't
a sign of Sandy."</p>

<p>"Have you tried the bar?" Lutchester inquired.</p>

<p>"Both the bar and the grillroom," Ferrani assured him.</p>

<p>"If he had been suddenly taken ill&mdash;" Molly
murmured.</p>

<p>"But there is no place in which he could have been taken ill
which we have not searched," Ferrani reminded her.</p>

<p>"And besides," Holderness intervened, "Sandy was in the very
pink of health, and bubbling over with high-spirits."</p>

<p>"One noticed that," Lutchester remarked, a little drily.</p>

<p>"He might almost have been called garrulous," Pamela
agreed.</p>

<p>Ferrani took grave leave of them, and Holderness seated
himself at the table.</p>

<p>"Well, let's get on with luncheon, anyway," he advised. "It's
no good bothering. The best thing we can do is to conclude that
the impossible has happened&mdash;that Sandy has met with some
pals and will be here presently."</p>

<p>"Or possibly," Lutchester suggested, "that he has done what
certainly seems the most reasonable thing&mdash;gone straight
off to the War Office with his formula and forgotten all about
us. Let us return the compliment and forget all about him."</p>

<p>They finished their luncheon a little more cheerfully. As the
cigarettes were handed round, Pamela's eyes looked longingly at
a tray of Turkish coffee which was passing.</p>

<p>"I'm a rotten host," Holderness declared, "but, to tell you
the truth, this queer prank of Sandy's has driven everything
else out of my mind. Here, Hassan!"</p>

<p>The coloured man in gorgeous oriental livery turned at once
with a smile. He approached the table, bowing to each of them in
turn. Pamela watched him intently, and, as his eyes met hers,
Hassan's hands began to shake.</p>

<p>"The waiter is bringing us ordinary coffee," Holderness
explained. "Please countermand it and bring us Turkish coffee
for four."</p>

<p>The man had lost his savoir faire. His wonderful smile had
turned into something sickly, his bland speech of thanks into a
mumble. He turned away almost sheepishly.</p>

<p>"Hassan doesn't seem to like us to-day," Molly remarked.</p>

<p>"I should have said that he was drunk," her brother observed,
looking after him curiously.</p>

<p>There was certainly something the matter with Hassan, for it
was at least a quarter of an hour before he reappeared and
served his specially prepared concoction with the usual ceremony
but with more restraint. Molly and the two men, after Hassan had
sprinkled the contents of his mysterious little flask into their
coffee, gave him their hands for the customary salute. When he
came to Pamela he hesitated. She shook her head and he fell
back, bowing respectfully, his hand tracing cabalistic signs
across his heart. For a moment before he departed, he raised his
eyes and glanced at her. It was like the mute appeal of some
hurt or frightened animal.</p>

<p>"You don't approve of Hassan's little ceremony?" Lutchester
asked her.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"In America," she observed, "I think we look upon coloured
people of any sort a little differently. Well, we've certainly
given your friend a chance," she went on, glancing at the little
jewelled watch upon her wrist, "We've outstayed almost every one
here."</p>

<p>Their host paid the bill, and they strolled reluctantly
towards the door, Holderness and Pamela a few steps behind.</p>

<p>"Now what are your sister and Mr. Lutchester studying again?"
the latter inquired, as they reached the lobby.</p>

<p>Molly had paused once more before the notice on the wall,
which seemed somehow to have fascinated her. She read it out,
lingering on every word:</p>

<br>

<p class="sign">
M&Eacute;FIEZ-VOUS!<br>
TAISEZ-VOUS!<br>
LES OREILLES ENNEMIES VOUS &Eacute;COUTENT!</p>


<br>

<p>Holderness listened with a frown. Then he turned suddenly to
Lutchester, who was standing by his side.</p>

<p>"It would be too ridiculous, wouldn't it&mdash;you couldn't
in any way connect the idea behind that notice with Sandy's
disappearance?"</p>

<p>"I was wondering about that myself," Lutchester confessed.
"To tell you the truth, I have been wondering all luncheon-time.
If ever a man broke the letter and the spirit of that simple
warning I should say your excitable young friend, Captain
Graham, did."</p>

<p>"But here at Henry's," Holderness protested, "with friends on
every side! Isn't it a little too ridiculous! We'll wait until
the last person is out of the place, anyway," he added.</p>

<p>The crowd soon began to thin. Ferrani, seeing them still
waiting, approached with a little bow.</p>

<p>"Your friend," he asked, "he has not arrived, eh?"</p>

<p>"No sign of him," Holderness replied gloomily.</p>

<p>"What about his hat and coat?" Ferrani inquired, with a
sudden inspiration.</p>

<p>"Great idea," Holderness assented, turning towards the
cloakroom attendant. "Don't you remember my friend, James?" he
went on. "He arrived about half-past one, and threw his coat and
hat over to you."</p>

<p>The attendant nodded and glanced towards an empty peg.</p>

<p>"I remember him quite well, sir," he acknowledged. "Number
sixty-seven was his number."</p>

<p>"Where are his things, then?"</p>

<p>"Gone, sir," the man replied.</p>

<p>"Do you remember his asking for them?"</p>

<p>The attendant shook his head.</p>

<p>"Can't say that I do, sir," he acknowledged, "but they've
gone right enough."</p>

<p>A party of outgoing guests claimed the man's attention.
Holderness turned away.</p>

<p>"This thing is getting on my nerves," he declared. "Does it
seem likely that Sandy should chuck his luncheon without a word
of explanation, come out and get his coat and hat and walk off?
And, besides, where was he all the time we were looking for
him?"</p>

<p>It was unanswerable, inexplicable. They all looked at one
another almost helplessly. Pamela held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Well," she announced, "I am sorry, but I'm afraid that I
must go. I have a great many things to attend to this
afternoon."</p>

<p>"You are going away soon?" Lutchester inquired.</p>

<p>She hesitated, and at that moment Mr. Fischer, who had been
saying farewell to his guests, turned towards her.</p>

<p>"You are not thinking of the trip home yet, Miss Van Teyl?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," she answered a little evasively. "I'm out
of humour with London just now."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall be fellow-passengers on Thursday?" he
ventured. "I am going over on the <i>New York</i>."</p>

<p>"I never make plans," she told him.</p>

<p>"In any case," Mr. Fischer continued, "I shall anticipate our
early meeting in New York. I heard from your brother only
yesterday."</p>

<p>She looked at him with a slight frown.</p>

<p>"From James?"</p>

<p>Mr. Fischer nodded.</p>

<p>"Why, I didn't know," she observed, "that you and he were
acquainted."</p>

<p>"I have had large transactions with his firm, and naturally I
have seen a good deal of Mr. Van Teyl," the other explained. "He
looks after the interests of us Western clients."</p>

<p>Pamela turned a little abruptly away, and Lutchester walked
with her to the door.</p>

<p>"You will let me see that they bring your car round?" he
asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Thank you, no," she replied, holding out her hand. "I have
not yet said good-by to Captain Holderness and his sister.
Good-by, Mr. Lutchester!"</p>

<p>Her farewell was purposely chilly. It seemed as though the
slight sparring in which they had indulged throughout
luncheon-time, had found its culmination in an antipathy
which she had no desire to conceal. Lutchester, however,
only smiled.</p>

<p>"Nowadays," he observed, "that is a word which it is never
necessary to use."</p>

<p>She withdrew her hand from his somewhat too tenacious clasp.
Something in his manner puzzled as well as irritated her.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you, too, are thinking of taking a holiday
from your strenuous labours?" she asked. "Perhaps America is the
safest country in the world just now for an Englishman
who&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped short, realising the lengths towards which her
causeless pique was carrying her.</p>

<p>"Prefers departmental work to fighting, were you going to
add?" he said quietly. "Well, perhaps you are right. At any
rate, I will content myself by saying <i>au revoir</i>."</p>

<p>He passed through the turnstile door and disappeared. Pamela
made her adieux to Holderness and his sister, and then,
recognising some acquaintances, turned back into the restaurant
to speak to them. Fischer, who had just received his hat and
cane from the cloakroom attendant, stood watching her.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="first">Pamela, after a brief conversation with her
friends, once more left the restaurant. In the lobby she called
Ferrani to her.</p>

<p>"Has Mr. Fischer gone, Ferrani?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Not two minutes ago," the man replied. "You wish to speak to
him? I can stop him even now."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," she said drily, "Mr. Fischer represents a
type of my countrymen of whom I am not very fond. He is a great
patron of yours, is he not?"</p>

<p>"He is a large shareholder in the company," Ferrani
confessed.</p>

<p>"Then your restaurant will prosper," she told him. "Mr.
Fischer has the name of being very fortunate.... That was a
wonderful luncheon you gave us to-day."</p>

<p>"Madame is very kind."</p>

<p>"Will you do me a favour?"</p>

<p>Ferrani's gesture was all-expressive. Words were entirely
superfluous.</p>

<p>"I want two addresses, please. First, the address of Joseph,
your head musician, and, secondly, the address of Hassan, your
coffee-maker."</p>

<p>Ferrani effectually concealed any surprise he might have
felt. He tore a page from his pocket-book.</p>

<p>"Both I know," he declared. "Hassan lodges at a shop eighty
yards away. The name is Haines, and there are newspaper placards
outside the door."</p>

<p>"That is quite enough," Pamela murmured.</p>

<p>"As for Monsieur Joseph," Ferrani continued, "that is a
different matter. He has, I understand, a small flat in Tower
Mansions, Tower Street, leading off the Edgware Road. The number
is 18C. So!"</p>

<p>He wrote it down and passed it to her. Pamela thanked him and
stood up.</p>

<p>"Now that I have done as you asked me," Ferrani concluded,
"let me add a word. Both these men are already off duty and have
left the restaurant. If you wish to communicate with either of
them, I advise you to do so by letter."</p>

<p>"You are a very courteous gentleman, Mr. Ferrani," Pamela
declared, dropping him a little mock curtsey, "and good
morning!"</p>

<p>She made her way into the street outside, shook her head to
the commissionaire's upraised whistle, and strolled along until
she came to a cross street down which several motor-cars were
waiting. She approached one&mdash;a very handsome
limousine&mdash;and checked the driver who would have sprung
from his seat.</p>

<p>"George," she said, "I am going to pay a call at a
disreputable-looking news-shop, just where I am pointing. You
can't bring the car there, as the street is too narrow. You
might follow me on foot and be about."</p>

<p>The young man touched his hat and obeyed. A few yards down
the street Pamela found her destination, and entered a gloomy
little shop. A slatternly woman looked at her curiously from
behind the counter.</p>

<p>"I am told that Hassan lodges here, the coffee-maker from
Henry's," Pamela began.</p>

<p>The woman looked at her in a peculiar fashion.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I wish to see him."</p>

<p>"You can't, then," was the curt answer. "He's at his
prayers."</p>

<p>"At what?" Pamela exclaimed.</p>

<p>"At his prayers," the woman repeated brusquely. "There," she
added, throwing open the door which led into the premises
behind, "can't you hear him, poor soul? He's been pinching some
more charms from ladies' bracelets, or something of the sort, I
reckon. He's always in trouble. He goes on like this for an hour
or so and then he forgives himself."</p>

<p>Pamela stood by the open door and listened&mdash;listened to
a strange, wailing chant, which rose and fell with almost weird
monotony.</p>

<p>"Very interesting," she observed. "I have heard that sort of
thing before. Now will you kindly tell Hassan that I wish to
speak to him, or shall I go and find him for myself?"</p>

<p>"Well, you've got some brass!" the woman declared, with a
sneer.</p>

<p>"And some gold," Pamela assented, passing a pound note over
to the woman.</p>

<p>"Do you want to see him alone?" the latter asked, almost
snatching at the note, but still regarding Pamela with
distrustful curiosity.</p>

<p>"Of course," was the calm reply.</p>

<p>The woman opened her lips and closed them again, sniffed, and
led the way down a short passage, at the end of which was a
door.</p>

<p>"There you are," she muttered, throwing it open. "You've arst
for it, mind. 'Tain't my business."</p>

<p>She slouched her way back again into the shop. At first
Pamela could scarcely see anything except a dark figure on his
knees before a closed and shrouded window. Then she saw Hassan
rise to his feet, saw the glitter of his eyes.</p>

<p>"Pull up the blind, Hassan," she directed.</p>

<p>He came a step nearer to her. The gloom in the apartment was
extraordinary. Only his shape and his eyes were visible.</p>

<p>"Do as I tell you," she ordered. "Pull up the blind. It will
be better."</p>

<p>He hesitated. Then he obeyed. Even then the interior of the
room seemed shadowy and obscure. Pamela could only see, in
contrast with the rest of the house, that it was wonderfully and
spotlessly clean. In one corner, barely concealed by a low
screen, his bed stood upon the floor. Hassan muttered something
in an Oriental tongue. Pamela interrupted him. She spoke in the
soothing tone one uses towards a child.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Hassan," she said. "Sorry to have
interrupted you at your prayers, but it had to be done. You know
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mistress," he answered unwillingly. "I your dragoman
one year in Cairo. What you want here, mistress?"</p>

<p>"You know that I know," she went on, "that you are a Turk and
a Mohammedan, and not an Egyptian at all."</p>

<p>"Yes, mistress, you know that," he muttered.</p>

<p>"And you also know," she continued, "that if I give you away
to the authorities you will be sent at once to a very
uncomfortable internment camp, where you won't even have an
opportunity to wash more than once a day, where you will have to
herd with all sorts of people, who will make fun of your colour
and your religion&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't, mistress!" he shouted suddenly. "You will not tell. I
think you will not tell!"</p>

<p>He was sidling a little towards her. Again one of those
curious changes seemed to have transformed him from a dumb,
passive creature into a savage. There was menace in his eyes.
She waved him back without moving.</p>

<p>"I have come to make a bargain with you, Hassan," she said,
"just a few words, that is all. Not quite so near, please."</p>

<p>He paused. There was a moment's silence. His face was within
a foot of hers, lowering, black, bestial. Her eyes met his
without a tremor. Her full, sweet lips only curved into a
faintly contemptuous line.</p>

<p>"You cannot frighten me, Hassan," she declared. "No man has
ever done that. And outside I have a chauffeur with muscles of
iron, who waits for me. Be reasonable. Listen. There are secrets
connected with your restaurant."</p>

<p>"I know nothing," he began at once; "nothing,
mistress&mdash;nothing!"</p>

<p>"Quite naturally," she continued. "I only need one piece of
information. A man disappeared there this morning. I just have
to find him. That's all there is about it. At half-past one he
was inveigled into the musicians' room and by some means or
other rendered unconscious. At three o'clock he had been
removed. I want to know what became of him. You help me and the
whole world can believe you to be an Egyptian for the rest of
their lives. If you can't help me it is rather unfortunate for
you, because I shall tell the police at once who and what you
are. Don't waste time, Hassan."</p>

<p>He stood thinking, rubbing his hands and bowing before her,
yet, as she knew very well, with murder in his heart. Once she
saw his long fingers raised a little.</p>

<p>"Quite useless, Hassan," she warned him. "They hang you in
England, you know, for any little trifle such as you are
thinking of. Be sensible, and I may even leave a few pound notes
behind me."</p>

<p>"Mistress should ask Joseph," he muttered. "I know
nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh, mistress is going to ask Joseph all right," she assured
him, "but I want a little information from you, too. You've got
to earn your freedom, you know, Hassan. Come, what do they do
with the people who disappear from the restaurant?"</p>

<p>"Not understand," was the almost piteous reply.</p>

<p>Pamela sighed. She had again the air of one being patient
with a child.</p>

<p>"See here, Hassan," she went on, "a few days ago I went over
that restaurant from top to bottom with the manager. There is
the musicians' room, isn't there, just over the entrance hall? I
suppose those little glass places in the floor are movable, and
then one can hear every word that is spoken below. I am right so
far, am I not?"</p>

<p>Hassan answered nothing. His breathing, however, had become a
little deeper.</p>

<p>"An unsuspecting person, passing from the toilet rooms
upstairs, could easily be induced to enter. I think that there
must be another exit from that room. Yes?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" Hassan faltered.</p>

<p>"To where?"</p>

<p>"The wine-cellars."</p>

<p>"And from there?"</p>

<p>Hassan was suddenly voluble. Truth unlocked his tongue.</p>

<p>"Not know, mistress&mdash;not know another thing. No one
enters wine-cellar but three men. One of those not know. If I
guess&mdash;I, Hassan&mdash;I look at little chapel left
standing in waste place. Perhaps I wonder sometimes, but I not
know."</p>

<p>Pamela drew three notes from her gold purse, smoothed them
out and handed them over.</p>

<p>"Three pounds, Hassan, silence, and good day! You'll live
longer if you open your windows now and then, and get a little
fresh air, instead of praying yourself hoarse."</p>

<p>Again the black figure swayed perilously towards her. She
affected not to notice, not to notice the hand which seemed for
a moment as though it would snatch the door handle from her
grasp. She passed out pleasantly and without haste. The last
sound she heard was a groan.</p>

<p>"Done your bit o' business, eh?" the landlady asked
curiously.</p>

<p>Pamela nodded assent.</p>

<p>"Rather an odd sort of lodger for you, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Not so odd as his visitors," the woman retorted, with an
evil sneer.</p>

<p>Pamela passed into the narrow street and drew a long sigh of
relief. Then she entered her car and gave the chauffeur an
address from the slip of paper which she carried in her hand.
When they stopped outside the little block of flats he prepared
to follow her.</p>

<p>"Tough neighbourhood this, madam," he said.</p>

<p>"Maybe, George," she replied, waving him back, "but you've
got to stay down here. If the man I am going to see thought I
was frightened of him I wouldn't have a chance. If I am not down
in half an hour you can try number 18C."</p>

<p>The chauffeur resumed his place on the driving-seat of the
car. Pamela, heartily disliking her surroundings, was escorted
by a shabby porter to a shabbier lift.</p>

<p>"You'll find Mr. Joseph in," the lift boy assured her with a
grin.</p>

<p>Pamela found the number at the end of an unswept stone
passage. At her third summons the door was cautiously opened by
a large, repulsive-looking woman, with a mass of peroxidised
hair. She stared at her visitor first in amazement, then in
rapidly gathering resentment.</p>

<p>"Mr. Joseph is at home," she admitted truculently, in
response to Pamela's inquiry. "What might you be wanting with
him?"</p>

<p>"If you will be so good as to let me in I will explain to Mr.
Joseph," Pamela replied.</p>

<p>The woman seemed on the point of slamming the door. Suddenly
there was a voice from behind her shoulder. Joseph
appeared&mdash;not the smiling, joyous Joseph of Henry's but a
sullen-looking negro, dressed in shirt and trousers only, with a
heavy under-lip and frowning forehead.</p>

<p>"Let the lady pass and get into the kitchen, Nora," he
ordered, "Come this way, mam."</p>

<p>Pamela followed her guide into a parlour, redolent of stale
cigar smoke, with oilcloth on the floor and varnished walls, an
abode even more horrible than Hassan's lair. Joseph closed the
door carefully behind him, and made no apology for his
<i>dishabill&eacute;</i>. He simply faced Pamela.</p>

<p>"Say, what is it you want with me?" he demanded
truculently.</p>

<p>"A trifle," she answered. "The key of the chapel in the
little plot of waste ground next Henry's."</p>

<p>She meant him to be staggered, and he was. He reeled back for
a moment.</p>

<p>"What the hell are you talking about?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Facts," Pamela replied. "Do you want to save yourself,
Joseph? You can do it if you choose."</p>

<p>He folded his arms and stood in front of the closed door.
Without a collar, his neck bulged unpleasantly behind. There was
nothing whatever left of the suave and genial <i>chef
d'orch&egrave;stre</i>.</p>

<p>"Save myself from what, eh? Just let me get wise about
it."</p>

<p>Pamela's eyebrows were daintily elevated.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" she murmured. "I thought you were more
intelligent. Listen. You know where we met last? Let me remind
you. You were playing in the Winter Garden at Berlin, and the
gentleman whom I was with, an attache at the American Embassy,
spoke to you. He told me a good deal about your past life,
Joseph, and your present one. You are in the pay of the Secret
Service of Germany. Am I to go to Scotland Yard and tell them
so?"</p>

<p>He looked at her wickedly.</p>

<p>"You'd have to get out of here first."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," she advised him contemptuously. "Remember
you're talking to an American woman and don't waste your breath.
You can be in the Secret Service of any country you like,
without interference from me. On the other hand, there's just
one thing I want from you."</p>

<p>"What is it? I haven't got any key."</p>

<p>"I want to discover exactly what has become of Captain
Graham," she declared.</p>

<p>"What, the guy that missed his lunch to-day?" he growled.</p>

<p>"I see you know all about it," she continued equably.</p>

<p>"So he's your spark, is he?" Joseph observed slowly, his eyes
blinking as he leaned a little forward.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," Pamela replied, "I have never met him.
However, that's beside the point. Do I have the key of that
chapel?"</p>

<p>"You do not."</p>

<p>"Have you got it?"</p>

<p>"Right here," Joseph assented, dangling it before her
eyes.</p>

<p>"I think it's a fair bargain I'm offering you," she reminded
him. "You lose the key and keep your place. You only have to
keep your mouth shut and nothing happens."</p>

<p>"Nothing doing," the negro declared shortly. "Keys as
important as this ain't lost. If I part with it, I get the
chuck, and I probably get into the same mess as the others. If I
keep it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you keep it," Pamela interrupted, "you will probably
stand with your back to the light in the Tower within the next
few days. They've left off being lenient with spies over
here."</p>

<p>He looked at her, and there were things in his eyes which few
women in the world could have seen without terror. Pamela's lips
only came a little closer together. She pressed the inside of
the ring upon her third finger, and a ray of green fire seemed
to shoot forward.</p>

<p>"I guess I'm up against it," he growled, taking a step
forward. "I'll have something of what's coming to me, if I swing
for it."</p>

<p>His arm was suddenly around her, his face hideously close. He
gave a little snarl as he felt the pinprick through his shirt
sleeve. Then he went spinning round and round with his hand to
his head.</p>

<p>"What in God's name!" he spluttered. "What in
hell&mdash;!"</p>

<p>He reeled against the horsehair easy-chair and slipped on to
the floor. Pamela calmly closed her ring, stooped over him,
withdrew the key from his pocket, crossed the room and the dingy
little hall with swift footsteps, and, without waiting for the
lift, fled down the stone steps. Before she reached the bottom,
she heard the shrill ringing of the lift bell, the angry
shouting of the woman. Pamela, however, strolled quietly out and
took her place in the car.</p>

<p>"Back to the hotel, George," she directed the chauffeur.
"Don't stop if they call to you from the flats."</p>

<p>The young man sprang up to his seat and the car glided off.
Pamela leaned forward and looked at herself in the mirror. There
was a shade more colour in her face, perhaps, than usual, but
her low waves of chestnut hair were unruffled. She used her
powder puff with attentive skill and leaned back.</p>

<p>"That's the disagreeable part of it over, anyway," she sighed
to herself contentedly.</p>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="first">THE last of the supper-guests had left Henry's
Restaurant, the commissionaire's whistle was silent. The light
laughter and frivolous adieux of the departing guests seemed to
have melted away into a world somewhere beyond the pale of the
unseasonable fog. The little strip of waste ground adjoining was
wrapped in gloom and silence. The exterior of the bare and
deserted chapel, long since unconsecrate, was dull and lifeless.
Inside, however, began the march of strange things. First of
all, the pinprick of light of a tiny electric torch seemed as
though it had risen from the floor, and Hassan, pushing back a
trap-door, stepped into the bare, dusty conventicle. He listened
for a moment, then made a tour of the windows, touched a spring
in the wall, and drew down long, thick blinds. Afterwards he
passed between the row of dilapidated benches and paused at the
entrance door. He stooped down, examined the keyless lock, shook
it gently, gazed upwards and downwards as though in vain search
of bolts that were never there. His white teeth gleamed for a
moment in the darkness. He turned away with a little shiver.</p>

<p>"Not my fault," he muttered to himself. "Not my fault."</p>

<p>He listened for a moment intently, as though for footsteps
outside. The disturbance, however, came from the other end of
the building. There was a sharp knocking from the trap-door by
which he had ascended. He touched an electric knob. The place
was dimly yet sufficiently illuminated. He hastened towards the
further end of the place and pulled up the trap-door. A
melancholy-looking little procession slowly emerged. First of
all came Joseph, stepping backwards, supporting the head and
shoulders of Graham, still bound and gagged. After him came a
dark, swarthy-faced wine waiter, who supported Graham's feet.
Behind followed Fischer, carrying his silk hat and cane in his
hand. He paused for a moment as he stepped on the floor of the
chapel, and brushed the dust from his trousers.</p>

<p>"You can take out the gag now," he ordered the two men.
"There isn't much shout in him."</p>

<p>They laid him upon a couch, and Joseph obeyed the order.
Graham's head swung helplessly on one side. His eyes opened,
however, and he struggled for consciousness. His lips twitched
for a moment. In these long hours he had almost forgotten the
habit of speech. The words, when they came, sounded strange to
him.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;where am I? What do you want with me?"</p>

<p>Fischer laid his hat and stick upon a table, on which also
stood a telephone instrument.</p>

<p>"The formula, my young friend," he replied, "for that
wonderful explosive of which you spoke in the lobby."</p>

<p>A sudden accession of nervous strength brought something
almost like passion into the young man's reply, although to
himself there still seemed some unreality in the words which
might have come from the walls or the roof&mdash;surely not from
his lips.</p>

<p>"I'll see you damned first!"</p>

<p>Fischer smiled. The man was good-looking, in his way, but
this was a pale and ugly smile.</p>

<p>"My request was merely a matter of courtesy," he remarked.
"The difficulty of searching you is not formidable. It would
have been undertaken long ago but for the fact that the
restaurant has been crowded and gags sometimes slip. Besides,
there was no hurry. Observe!"</p>

<p>He leaned over Graham, who for the first time struggled
furiously but ineffectually with his bonds. His fingers all the
time were straining towards the inside pocket of his coat.
Fischer nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>"Allow me to anticipate you," he said.</p>

<p>With a quick thrust he drew a little handful of papers from
the pocket of his captive. One by one he glanced them through
and flung them on to the floor. As he came towards the end of
his search, however, his expression of confident complacency
vanished. His lips shrivelled up a little, his eyes narrowed.
The last folded sheet of paper&mdash;a little perfumed note from
Peggy, thanking Sandy for his beautiful roses&mdash;he crumpled
fiercely into a little ball. He opened his lips to speak, then
he paused. A new light broke in upon him. The fury had passed
from Sandy Graham's face. In its stead there was an expression
of blank astonishment.</p>

<p>"Where is the formula?" Fischer asked fiercely.</p>

<p>There was no reply. Sandy Graham was still staring at the
little pile of papers upon the floor. Fischer made a brief
examination of the other pockets. Then he stepped back. His
voice shook, his face was dark and malevolent.</p>

<p>"Joseph, Hassan, Jules&mdash;listen to me!" he ordered. "Did
any one else enter the musicians' room whilst he was lying in
the alcove?"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" Jules declared.</p>

<p>"The door was locked," Hassan murmured.</p>

<p>"Stop!" Joseph exclaimed.</p>

<p>Fischer wheeled round upon him.</p>

<p>"Well?" he exclaimed. "Get on, then. Who?"</p>

<p>Joseph moistened his lips. He was still feeling sore and
dizzy, but he began to see his way.</p>

<p>"You noticed, perhaps," he said, "the American girl&mdash;the
beautiful young lady with this guy's friends? She was waiting
with the others for Captain Graham to come down. I saw her go up
the stairs. I saw her come down again, three minutes later."</p>

<p>"Miss Van Teyl?" Fischer exclaimed, with a frown. "You're
mad, Joseph!"</p>

<p>The negro laughed grimly.</p>

<p>"Am I!" he retorted. "I tell you this, Master Fischer. She
was in Berlin where I was, and she was at the Embassy every day.
She was asked to leave there. They put her over the frontier
into Holland. I knew her when she came into the restaurant.
She's no society young lady, she ain't! Bet you she was on to
the goods."</p>

<p>Fischer hesitated for a moment. The thoughts were chasing one
another through his brain. Then he took up the receiver from the
telephone instrument which stood upon the table.</p>

<p>"1560 Mayfair," he asked in a low tone.</p>

<p>They all stood listening, grouped around Graham's writhing
figure.</p>

<p>"Hullo! Is that Claridge's Hotel?" Fischer went on. "I am
speaking from Ciro's. Put me through, if you please, to Miss Van
Teyl's apartments... What? Repeat that, will you?... Thank
you."</p>

<p>Fischer laid down the receiver. He turned towards the others.
He was breathing a little quickly, and his eyes glittered behind
his gold-rimmed spectacles.</p>

<p>"Miss Van Teyl," he announced, "has left for Tilbury. She is
going out on the <i>Lapland</i> this morning. My God, she's got
the formula!"</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. Joseph was standing by with a
wicked look on his face.</p>

<p>"I saw her slip away," he muttered, "and I watched her come
down again. There was just time."</p>

<p>Fischer turned suddenly to where Graham was lying. He drew a
sheet of writing paper from the rack upon the table, and a
pencil from his pocket. There was an evil and concentrated
significance in his tone.</p>

<p>"That formula," he said, "can be written again. I think you
had better write it."</p>

<p>"I'll see you damned first!" was the weak but prompt
reply.</p>

<p>Fischer bent a little lower over the prostrate figure, "Look
here," he went on, "we don't run risks like this for nothing.
You're better dead than alive, so far as we are concerned,
anyway. We'd planned to take the formula from you, and you can
guess the rest. There are cellars underneath here into which no
one ever goes who matters. Now here's a chance of life for you.
Write down that formula&mdash;truthfully, mind&mdash;and we'll
discuss the matter of taking your parole."</p>

<p>"See you damned first!" Graham repeated, his voice a little
more tremulous but still convincing.</p>

<p>Fischer stood upright and turned to Jules.</p>

<p>"Get a bottle of brandy and a glass," he ordered.</p>

<p>The man pushed open the trap-door and disappeared. He came
back again in a few moments, with a bottle in one hand and a
glass in the other. Fischer poured out some of the cordial and
drew a small table up to Graham's side.</p>

<p>"There," he said, loosening the cord around his left wrist,
"drink that, and think it over. We shall be gone for about ten
minutes. If you change your mind before, ring that little
hand-bell. If you have not changed your mind when we return,
it will be the cellars."</p>

<p>"Beasts!" Graham muttered.</p>

<p>Fischer shrugged his shoulders. For a moment he had
straightened himself. His face had softened, but it was in tune
with his thoughts.</p>

<p>"I would twist the necks of a million fools like you," he
said, "for the sake of&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, leaving his sentence uncompleted, and beckoned to
the other men. They followed him through the trap-door and down
into the cellars below. The place was once more silent. Graham
rolled from side to side, drew a long breath, and tugged vainly
at his bonds. The effort overtaxed his strength. He seemed to
feel the darkness closing in upon him, the rushing of the sea in
his ears....</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="first">SO far as Sandy Graham was concerned, his
unconsciousness might have lasted an hour or a day. As a matter
of fact, it was scarcely a minute after the disappearance of
Fischer and his confederates when he was conscious of a rush of
cold air in the place, and beheld the vision of a tiny flash of
light at the lower end of the gloomy building. Immediately
afterwards he heard the soft closing of a door and beheld a
tall, shadowy figure slowly approaching. He lay quite still and
looked at it, and his heart began to beat with hope. One of the
lights had been left burning, and there was something in the
bearing and attitude of the man who finally came to a standstill
by his side, which was entirely reassuring.</p>

<p>"Lutchester!" he faltered. "My God, how did you get
here?"</p>

<p>"Offices of a young lady," Lutchester observed, producing a
knife from his pocket. "Allow me!"</p>

<p>He cut the cords which still secured Graham's limbs. Then he
looked around him.</p>

<p>"How did they bring you here?" he whispered. "I suppose there
is a passage from the restaurant?"</p>

<p>"Up through a trapdoor there," Graham explained,
pointing.</p>

<p>Lutchester stood over it and listened intently.</p>

<p>Then he turned around, lifted the glass of brandy from the
table, smelt it approvingly, and tasted it.</p>

<p>"Excellent!" he pronounced. "The 1840. Allow me!"</p>

<p>He refilled the glass and handed it to Sandy, who gulped down
the contents. The effect was almost instantaneous. In less than
a minute he had staggered to his feet.</p>

<p>"Feel strong enough to walk about fifty yards?" Lutchester
inquired.</p>

<p>"I'd walk to hell to get out of this place!" was the prompt
reply.</p>

<p>Lutchester took his arm, and they passed down the dusty aisle
between the worm-eaten and decaying benches and through the
outside door, which Lutchester closed and locked behind them.
The rush of cold air was like new life to Graham.</p>

<p>"I can walk all right now," he muttered. "My God, we'll give
these fellows hell for this!"</p>

<p>They made their very difficult way across a plot of ground
from which a row of dilapidated cottages had been razed to the
ground. The fog still hung around them and seemed to bring with
it a curious silence, although the dying traffic from one of the
main thoroughfares reached them in muffled notes. Lutchester
climbed to the top of a pile of rubbish and then, turning
around, held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Up here," he directed.</p>

<p>Graham struggled up until he stood by his companion's side.
The latter stood quite still, listening for a moment. Then he
climbed a little higher and swung around, holding out his hand
once more.</p>

<p>"I'm on top of the wall," he said. "Come on."</p>

<p>Graham's knees were shaking, but with Lutchester's help he
staggered up and reached his side. On the pavement below a man
in chauffeur's livery was standing, holding out his hands, and
by the side of the curbstone a closed car was waiting. Somehow
or other the two reached the pavement. Lutchester almost pushed
his companion into the limousine and stepped in after him. The
chauffeur sprang to his seat and the car glided off. Graham just
realised that there was a woman by his side whose face was
vaguely familiar. Then the waves broke in upon his ears once
more.</p>

<p>"I was right, then, it seems," Pamela observed approvingly.
"You were just the man for this little affair."</p>

<p>Lutchester sighed.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately," he confessed, "a messenger boy would have
been as effective. I stumbled over to the chapel&mdash;rubber
shoes, you observe," he remarked, pointing downwards&mdash;"and
soon discovered that blinds had been let down all round and that
there were people inside. There was just a faint chink in one,
and I caught a glimpse of several men, your friend Oscar amongst
them. Having," he went on, "an immense regard for my personal
safety, I was hesitating what means to adopt when the lights
were lowered, and it seemed to me that the men were
disappearing."</p>

<p>"Do go on," Pamela murmured. "This is most exciting."</p>

<p>"In a sense it was disappointing," Lutchester complained. "I
had pictured for myself a dramatic entrance ... a quiet turning
of the key, a soft approach&mdash; owing to my shoes," he
reminded her&mdash;"a cough, perhaps, or a breath ... discovery,
me with a revolver in my hand pointed to the arch-villain&mdash;'If you stir you're a dead man!' ... Natural
collapse of the villain. With my left hand I slash the bonds
which hold Graham, with my right I cover the miscreants. One of
them, perhaps, might creep behind me, and I hesitate. If I move
my revolver the other two will get the drop on me&mdash;I think
that is the correct expression? A wonderful moment, that, Miss
Van Teyl!"</p>

<p>"But it didn't happen," she protested.</p>

<p>"Ah! I forgot that," he acknowledged. "Still, I was prepared,
I had the revolver all right. But as you say, it didn't happen.
I made my way to the chapel door, let myself in, found our
friend lying in a half-comatose state upon one of the blue plush
Henry sofas, in the shadow of a horrible deal pulpit. I gathered
that he had been left there to reflect upon his sins. There was
a bottle of remarkably fine brandy within reach, which I tested,
and with which I dosed our friend here. I then cut away his
bonds, arm in arm we walked down the aisle, I locked up the
place, threw the key away, kicked my shins half-a-dozen times
crossing that disgusting little plot of land, climbed boldly to
the top of the wall, and behold!"</p>

<p>Pamela smiled upon him in congratulatory fashion.</p>

<p>"On the whole," she said, "I am quite glad that I telephoned
to you."</p>

<p>"You showed a sound discretion," he admitted.</p>

<p>"If he had not been lame," she confessed, "I should have sent
to Captain Holderness."</p>

<p>"That would have been a great mistake," Lutchester assured
her. "Holderness is a good fellow but devoid of imagination. He
is great on constituted authority. He would have probably
marched up with a squad of heavy-footed policemen&mdash;and
found nothing."</p>

<p>"Yet I must confess," Pamela persisted, with a frankness
unaccountable even to herself, "that if I could have thought of
any one else I should never have telephoned to you."</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I should not have classified you as being of the
adventurous type," she declared.</p>

<p>Lutchester looked injured.</p>

<p>"After all," he protested, "that is not my fault. That is due
to your singular lack of perception. However, I am able to
return the compliment. I, for my part, should have thought that
you were more interested in the fashions than in paying
exceedingly rash visits to degenerate orientals and
negroes."</p>

<p>"Perhaps some day," she remarked, "we may understand one
another better."</p>

<p>He met her gaze with a certain seriousness.</p>

<p>"I hope that we may," he said.</p>

<p>For some reason they were both silent for a moment. Her tone
had changed a little when she spoke again.</p>

<p>"You are sure," she asked, "that you do not mind my leaving
the rest of this affair in your hands? There are reasons, which
I cannot tell you of just now, which make me anxious not to
appear in it at all."</p>

<p>"I accept the charge as a privilege," he assented. "We are
within a few yards of my rooms now. I promise you that I will
look after Captain Graham and advise him as to the proper course
for him to pursue."</p>

<p>The car came to a standstill.</p>

<p>"This then," she said, holding out her hand, "will be good-by
for the present."</p>

<p>He held her fingers for a moment without reply. Quite
suddenly she decided that she liked him. Then he lifted Graham,
who was half asleep, half unconscious, to his feet, and assisted
him from the car.</p>

<p>"Where shall I tell the man to go to?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"He knows," she answered with sudden taciturnity.</p>

<p>"Wherever it may be, then," he replied, "bon voyage!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="first">IT was about half-an-hour later when Sandy
Graham opened his eyes and began to feel the life once more warm
in his veins. He was seated in the most comfortable easy-chair
of John Lutchester's bachelor sitting-room. By his side was a
coffee equipage and a decanter of brandy. His head still
throbbed, and his bones ached, but his mind was beginning to
grow clearer. Lutchester, who had been seated at the writing
table, swung round in his chair at the sound of his guest's
movement.</p>

<p>"Feeling better, eh?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am all right now," was the somewhat shaky reply. "Got a
head like a turnip and a tongue like a lime-kiln, but I'm
beginning&mdash;to feel myself."</p>

<p>"How's your memory?"</p>

<p>"Hazy. Let me see.... My God, I've been robbed, haven't
I!"</p>

<p>"So I imagine," Lutchester replied. "You rather asked for it,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>Graham moved uneasily in his place. He had suddenly the
feeling of being back at school&mdash;and in the presence of the
headmaster.</p>

<p>"I suppose I did in a way," he admitted, "but at
Henry's&mdash;why, I've always looked upon the place as a club
more than anything else."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that I can't agree with you there," Lutchester
observed. "I should consider Henry's a remarkably cosmopolitan
restaurant, where a man in your position should exercise more
than even ordinary restraint."</p>

<p>"I suppose I was wrong," Graham muttered, "but I had been
working for about ten hours on end, and then rushed up to London
in the car to try and keep my appointment with Holderness."</p>

<p>"Stop anywhere on the way?"</p>

<p>"We had a few drinks," Graham confessed. "I was so done up.
Perhaps I had more than I meant to. However, it's no use
bothering about that now. I've been robbed, and that's all there
is about it. Could we get on to Scotland Yard from here?"</p>

<p>"We could, but I don't think we will," Lutchester
replied.</p>

<p>Graham was puzzled.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he demanded. "That formula was the most wonderful
thing that has ever been put together, and the whole thing's so
simple. I've been afraid every second that some one else might
stumble upon it."</p>

<p>"It is without doubt a great loss," Lutchester admitted. "All
the same, I don't fancy that it's a Scotland Yard business
exactly. Have you any idea who robbed you?"</p>

<p>Graham paused to think. His eyes were still troubled and
uncertain.</p>

<p>"It's coming back to me," he muttered. "I remember that
beastly barn of a chapel. There were Jules, and that musician
fellow, and the big American. He emptied my pockets ... Why, of
course, I remember how angry he was ... My pocketbook was gone!
They left me alone to write out the formula again, and then you
came.... How on earth did you tumble on to my being there,
Lutchester?"</p>

<p>"It was Miss Pamela Van Teyl whom you must thank," Lutchester
told him, "not me. It seems she knew more about Henry's than any
of us. She'd come up against some of the crew in Berlin, and she
guessed they were holding you for that formula. She got the key
out of one of those men and then telephoned to me for my
help."</p>

<p>"And I never even thanked her," Graham murmured weakly.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. The recovering man's
consciousness of his position and of events was evidently as yet
incomplete. He sat up suddenly in his chair, gripping the sides
of it. His eyes were large with reminiscent trouble.</p>

<p>"My pocketbook had gone when they searched me," he
muttered.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that you had it with you when you came into
Henry's?" Lutchester inquired.</p>

<p>"Absolutely certain."</p>

<p>"Do you think you can remember now what happened when you
went upstairs?"</p>

<p>"I reached the lavatory all right&mdash;you were with me
then, weren't you?" Graham said reflectively. "I hung up my coat
while I washed, but there was no one else in the room. Then you
went downstairs and I brushed my hair and just stopped to light
a cigarette. You know that on the right-hand side of the landing
there is a room where the musicians change. Joseph, that black
devil, was standing in the doorway. He grinned as I came into
sight. 'Lady wants to speak to you for a moment, Captain
Graham,' he said. Well, you know how harmless the fellow
looks&mdash;just a good-natured, smiling nigger. I never dreamed
of anything wrong. As a matter of fact, I thought that Peggy
Vincent&mdash;that's a young lady I often go to Henry's
with&mdash;wanted to have a word with me before I joined our
party. I stepped inside the room, and that's just about all I
can remember. It must have been jolly quick. His arm shot round
my neck, the door was closed, and that other brute&mdash;Hassan,
I think it was&mdash;held something over my face."</p>

<p>"But that room was searched," Lutchester reminded him.</p>

<p>"Well I came to just a little," Graham explained, "I found
that I was in a sort of cupboard place, behind the lockers these
fellows have for their clothes. It opens with a spring lock, and
you'd never notice it, searching the room."</p>

<p>"Who was the first person you saw when you recovered
consciousness?"</p>

<p>Graham's forehead was wrinkled in the effort to remember.</p>

<p>"I can't quite get hold of it," he confessed, "but I have a
sort of fancy I can't altogether get rid of that there was a
woman about."</p>

<p>Lutchester looked at the end of the cigarette he had just
lit.</p>

<p>"A woman?" he repeated. "That's queer."</p>

<p>"I can't remember anything definitely until I woke up in that
chapel," Graham continued, "but when they searched me and found
that the pocketbook had gone, Fischer, the big American,
muttered some woman's name. I was queer just at the moment, but
it sounded very much to me like Miss Van Teyl's. He rang her up
on the telephone."</p>

<p>"Did they suspect Miss Van Teyl, then, of having taken your
pocketbook?"</p>

<p>Graham shook his head.</p>

<p>"I lost the drift of things just then," he admitted. "She
couldn't have done, in any case. Forgive me, but aren't we
wasting time, Mr. Lutchester? We must do something. Couldn't you
ring up Scotland Yard now?"</p>

<p>"I certainly could," Lutchester assented, "but, as I told you
just now, I don't think that I will."</p>

<p>Graham stared at him.</p>

<p>"But why not?"</p>

<p>"For certain very definite reasons with which you needn't
trouble yourself just now," Lutchester pronounced. "The formula
has gone, without a doubt, but it certainly isn't in the hands
of any of the people at Henry's."</p>

<p>"But there's that American fellow&mdash;Fischer!" Graham
exclaimed. "He was the ringleader!"</p>

<p>"Just so," Lutchester murmured thoughtfully. "However, he
hasn't got the formula."</p>

<p>"But he planned the attack upon me," Graham protested. "He is
an enemy&mdash;a German&mdash;sheltering himself under his
American naturalization. Surely we're going for him?"</p>

<p>"He's a wrong 'un, of course," Lutchester admitted, "but he
hasn't got the formula."</p>

<p>"But we must do something!" Graham continued, his anger
rising as his strength returned. "Why, the place is a perfect
den of conspirators! I expect Ferrani himself is in it, and
there's that other <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, Jules, and those black
beasts, Joseph and Hassan, besides Fischer. My God, they shall
pay for this!"</p>

<p>Lutchester nodded.</p>

<p>"I dare say they will," he admitted, "but not quite in the
way you are thinking of."</p>

<p>Graham half rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, "I'm sane enough now, aren't I, and in
my proper senses? You are not going to suggest that we don't
turn the police on to that damned place?"</p>

<p>"I certainly am," was the brief reply.</p>

<p>Graham was aghast.</p>

<p>"What do you mean to do, then?"</p>

<p>"Leave them alone for the present. Not one of them has the
formula. Not one of them even knows where it is."</p>

<p>"But the attack upon me?"</p>

<p>"You asked for all you got," Lutchester told him curtly, "and
perhaps a little more."</p>

<p>The first tinge of colour came back to Graham's cheeks. His
eyes flashed with anger.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I did," he admitted, "but that doesn't alter the
fact that I'm going to have some of my own back out of
them."</p>

<p>Lutchester crossed his legs and turned round in his chair.
For the first time he directly faced his visitor. His tone,
though not unkindly, was imperative.</p>

<p>"Young fellow," he said, "you'll have to listen to me about
this."</p>

<p>A smouldering sense of revolt suddenly found words.</p>

<p>"Listen to you? What the devil have you got to do with it?"
Graham demanded.</p>

<p>"I hate to remind any one of an obligation," Lutchester
answered, "but I am under the impression that, together with
Miss Van Teyl, of course, I rescued you from an exceedingly
inconvenient situation."</p>

<p>"I haven't had time yet to tell you how grateful I am,"
Graham said awkwardly. "You were a brick, of course, and how you
and Miss Van Teyl tumbled on to the whole thing I can't imagine.
But I don't understand what you're getting at now. You can't
suggest that I am to leave these fellows alone and not give
information to the police?"</p>

<p>"The character of the place," Lutchester assured him, "is
already perfectly well known to the heads of the police. The
matter will be dealt with, but not in the way you suggest. And
so far as regards Fischer, I do not wish him interfered with for
the present."</p>

<p>"You do not wish him interfered with?" Graham repeated.
"Where the devil do you come in at all?"</p>

<p>"You can leave me out of the matter for the present. You want
the formula back, don't you?"</p>

<p>"My God, yes!" Graham muttered fervently. "It's all very well
to give one a pencil and a piece of paper and say 'Write it
out,' but there are calculations and proportions&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Precisely," Lutchester interrupted. "You want it back again.
Why not let Fischer do the business? He has an idea where it's
gone. The thing to do seems to me to follow him."</p>

<p>"To follow Fischer?" Graham repeated vaguely.</p>

<p>"Precisely. If he thinks the formula is in England, Fischer
will stay in England. If he thinks that it has gone abroad he
will go abroad. If we leave him free we can watch which he
does."</p>

<p>Graham swallowed half a wineglassful of the brandy by his
side. Then he leaned forward.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, "you'll forgive me if I repeat myself
and ask you once more&mdash;what the hell has all this got to do
with you?"</p>

<p>"Just this much," Lutchester replied, "that I insist upon
your taking the course of action in this matter which I
propose."</p>

<p>"You mean," Graham protested, working himself gradually into
a state of wrath, "that I am to go back to my rooms as though
nothing had happened, see Holderness and the others to-morrow,
and not have a word of explanation to offer? That I am to leave
those blackguards at Henry's to try their dirty games on some
one else, and let Fischer, the man who was fully inclined to
become my murderer, go away unharmed? I think not, Mr.
Lutchester. I am much obliged for your help, but you are talking
piffle."</p>

<p>"What do you propose to do, then?"</p>

<p>"I am going round to Scotland Yard myself."</p>

<p>Lutchester rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are for a minute, please," he begged.</p>

<p>He passed into a smaller room, and Graham could hear faintly
the sound of the telephone. In a minute or two his host
returned.</p>

<p>"Go in there and speak, Graham," he invited. "You will find
some one you know at the other end."</p>

<p>Graham did as he was bidden, and Lutchester closed the door
after him. For a few minutes the latter sat in his chair,
smoking quietly, his eyes fixed upon the fire. Then his
unwilling guest reappeared. He came into the room a little
unsteadily and looked with new eyes at the man who seemed so
unaccountably to have taken over the control of his affairs.</p>

<p>"I don't understand all this," he muttered. "Who the devil
are you, anyway, Lutchester?"</p>

<p>"A very ordinary person, I can assure you," was the quiet
reply. "However, you are satisfied, I suppose, that my advice is
good?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am satisfied," Graham answered nervously. "You know
that&mdash;that I'm under arrest?"</p>

<p>Lutchester nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, you're not asking for my sympathy, I suppose?" he
observed drily.</p>

<p>The young man flushed.</p>

<p>"I know that I behaved like a fool," he admitted. "All the
same, I've been working night and day for weeks on this problem.
I haven't even been up to town once. I must say I think they
seem inclined to be a little hard on me."</p>

<p>"No one is going to be in the least hard on you," Lutchester
assured him. "You have committed a frightful indiscretion, and
all that is asked of you now is to keep your mouth shut. If you
do that, I think a way will be found for you out of your
troubles."</p>

<p>"But what is to become of me?" Graham demanded.</p>

<p>"I understand that you are to be taken to Northumberland
to-morrow," Lutchester informed him. "There you will be allowed
every facility for fresh experiments. In the meantime, I have
promised to give you a shakedown here for the night. You will
find a soldier on guard outside your door, but you can treat him
as your servant."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," Graham faltered, a little vaguely. "If
only I could understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lutchester rose to his feet. His manner became more serious,
his tone had in it a note of finality.</p>

<p>"Captain Graham," he interrupted, "don't try to understand. I
will tell you as much as this, if it helps you. Henry's
Restaurant will be placed under the closest surveillance, but we
wish nothing disturbed there at the moment until we have
discovered the future plans of Mr. Oscar Fischer."</p>

<p>"The big German-American," Graham muttered. "He's the man you
ought to get hold of."</p>

<p>"Some day I hope that we may," Lutchester declared. "For the
moment, however, we want him undisturbed. You would scarcely
believe it, perhaps, if I told you that the theft of your
formulas is only a slight thing compared to the bigger business
that man has on hand. There is something else at the back of his
head which is worth heaven and earth to us to understand. We
want the formula and we shall have it, but more than anything
else in the world we want to know why Fischer has pledged his
word in Berlin to bring this war to an end within three months.
We have to find that out, and we are going to find it out&mdash;
from him. You see, I have treated you with confidence, Captain
Graham. Now let me show you to your room." Graham put his hand
to his forehead.</p>

<p>"I feel as though this were some sort of nightmare," he
muttered. "I've known you for several months, Mr. Lutchester,
and I have never heard you say a serious word. You dance at
Henry's; you made a good soldier, they said, but you'd had
enough of it in twelve months; you play auction bridge in the
afternoons; and you talk about the war as though it were simply
an irritating circumstance. And to-night&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lutchester threw open the door of his own bedroom and pointed
to the bathroom beyond.</p>

<p>"My man has put out everything he thinks you may want," he
said. "Try and get a good night's sleep. And, Graham."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Don't bother your head about me, and don't ask any more
questions."</p>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="first">THE <i>Lapland</i> was two days out from
Tilbury before Pamela appeared on deck, followed by her maid
with an armful of cushions, and the deck steward with her rugs.
She had scarcely made herself comfortable in a sunny corner when
she was aware of the approach of a large, familiar figure. Her
astonishment was entirely genuine.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fischer!" she exclaimed. "Why, how on earth did you
catch this steamer? I thought you were coming on the Thursday
boat?"</p>

<p>"Some inducement to change my mind," Mr. Fischer replied,
drawing a chair up to her side.</p>

<p>"Meaning me?"</p>

<p>"I guess that's so!"</p>

<p>"Of course, I'm exceedingly flattered," Pamela observed, "or
rather I should be if I believed you, but I don't see how you
could leave a supper-party at Henry's and go straight to
Tilbury."</p>

<p>"Say, how did you know I was supping at Henry's?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>"Because I was there for luncheon myself, as you know," she
answered carelessly, "and I heard you order your table for
supper."</p>

<p>Mr. Fischer nodded reminiscently.</p>

<p>"I always wind up with a little supper at Henry's, on my last
night in London," he remarked. "It left me two hours to get down
to Tilbury, but it don't take me long to start for anywhere when
I once make up my mind. That's the American of us, I suppose.
Besides, I never need much in the way of luggage. I keep clothes
over on the other side and clothes in New York, and a grip
always ready packed for a journey."</p>

<p>"You're so typical," she murmured, smiling.</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," he replied. "My business makes it
necessary for me to be always on the go. Have you heard from
your brother lately?"</p>

<p>Pamela shook her head.</p>

<p>"Jimmy is the most terrible correspondent," she complained.
"I don't think I've had any mail from him for two months."</p>

<p>"You didn't know that he and I were sharing rooms together,
then, in the Plaza Hotel, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Pamela turned her head a little and gazed at her companion in
genuine surprise.</p>

<p>"Sharing rooms in the Plaza Hotel?" she repeated.... "You and
Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"I guess that's so," Mr. Fischer assented. "We were doing
business together one day, and the subject cropped up somehow or
other. Your brother was thinking of making a move, and I'd just
been shown these rooms, which were a trifle on the large side
for me. I made him an offer and he jumped at it."</p>

<p>"I hope you're not leading James into extravagant ways," she
remarked anxiously. "I loved his little apartment in
Forty-Second Street and it was so inexpensive."</p>

<p>"Your brother's share of these rooms isn't anything more than
he can afford," Mr. Fischer assured her. "That I can promise
you. I guess his firm is doing well just now. If they've many
more clients like me they are."</p>

<p>"It is very nice of you to put business in his way," Pamela
said thoughtfully. "I wonder why you do it, Mr. Fischer?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I?"</p>

<p>"Well," Pamela went on, her eyes travelling out seaward for a
moment, "you seem to be one of those sort of men, Mr. Fischer,
who never do anything without an object."</p>

<p>"<i>Some</i> powers of observation," he admitted
blithely.</p>

<p>"You have an object in being kind to Jimmy, then?"</p>

<p>Mr. Fischer produced a cigar case and selected a cheroot.</p>

<p>"Mind my smoking?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least. The only time I mind things is when people
don't answer my questions."</p>

<p>"I was only kind of hesitating," Mr. Fischer went on, leaning
back once more in his chair. "You want the truth, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"I never think anything else is worth while."</p>

<p>"In the first place, then," her companion began, "your
brother belongs to what I suppose is known as the exclusive set
in New York. I am a Westerner with few friends there. Through
him I have obtained introductions to several people whom it was
interesting to me, from a business point of view, to know."</p>

<p>"I see," Pamela murmured. "You are at least frank, Mr.
Fischer."</p>

<p>"I am going to be more frank still," he promised her. "Then
another reason, of course, was because I liked him, and a third,
which I am not sure wasn't the chief of all, because he was your
brother."</p>

<p>Pamela laughed gaily.</p>

<p>"Is that necessary?"</p>

<p>"Necessary or not, it's the truth," he assured her. "I am a
man of quick impressions and lasting ones."</p>

<p>"But we've never met except on a steamer," Pamela reminded
him.</p>

<p>"I know it's the fashion," Mr. Fischer said, "to turn up
one's nose at steamer acquaintances. It isn't like that with me.
You see, I don't have as much opportunity of meeting folk as
some others, perhaps. The most interesting people I've known
socially I've met on steamers. I sat at your table, side by side
with you, Miss Van Teyl, for seven days a few months ago. I
guess I'll remember those seven days as long as I live."</p>

<p>Pamela turned her head and looked at him. The faintly
derisive smile died away from her lips. The man was in earnest.
A certain curiosity stole into her eyes as the seconds passed.
She studied his hard, strong face, with its great jaw and
prominent forehead; the mouth, a little too full, and belying
the rest of his physiognomy, yet with its own peculiar strength.
He had taken off his spectacles, and it seemed to her that the
cold, flinty light of his eyes had caught for a moment some
touch of the softer blue of the sea or the sky. Seated, he lost
some of the awkwardness of his too great and ill-carried height.
It seemed to her that he was at least a person to be reckoned
with, either in friendship or enmity.</p>

<p>"Are you an American born, Mr. Fischer," she asked him.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"I was born at Offenbach," he told her, "near Frankfurt. My
father brought me out to America when I was eleven years
old."</p>

<p>"You must find the present condition of things a little
trying for you," she observed.</p>

<p>Oscar Fischer put on his glasses again. He did not answer for
several moments.</p>

<p>"That opens up a subject, Miss Van Teyl," he said, "which
some day I should like to discuss with you."</p>

<p>"Why not now?" she invited. "I feel much more inclined for
conversation than reading."</p>

<p>"Tell me, then, to begin with," he asked thoughtfully, "on
which side are your sympathies?"</p>

<p>"I try to do my duty as an American citizen," she replied
promptly, "and that is to have no sympathies. Our dear country
has set the world an example of what neutrality should be. I
think it is the duty of us Americans to try and bring ourselves
into exactly the same line of feeling."</p>

<p>He changed his position a little uneasily. His attitude
became less of a sprawl. His eyes were fixed upon her face.</p>

<p>"I fear," he said, "that we are going to begin by a
disagreement. I do not consider that America has realised in the
least the duties of a neutral nation."</p>

<p>"You must explain that at once, if you please, before we go
any further," Pamela insisted.</p>

<p>"Is this neutrality?" Fischer demanded, his rather harsh
voice almost raucous now with a touch of real feeling. "America
ships daily millions of dollars' worth of those things that make
war possible, to France, to Italy, above all to England. She
keeps them supplied with ammunition, clothing, scientific
instruments, food&mdash;a dozen things which make war easier. To
Germany she sends nothing. Is that neutrality?"</p>

<p>"But America is perfectly willing to deal in the same way
with Germany," Pamela pointed out. "German agents can come and
place their orders and take away whatever they want. The market
is as much open to her as to the Allies."</p>

<p>Fischer was sitting bolt upright in his chair now. There was
a little spot of colour in his cheeks and his eyes flashed
behind his spectacles. He struck the side of the chair. He was
very angry.</p>

<p>"That is Jesuitical," he declared. "It is perfectly well-known that Germany is not in a position to fetch munitions from
America. Therefore, I say that there is no neutrality in
supplying one side in the war with goods which the other is
unable to procure."</p>

<p>"Then you place upon America the onus of Germany's naval
inferiority," Pamela remarked drily.</p>

<p>"Germany's maritime inferiority does not exist," Mr. Fischer
protested. "When the moment arrives that the High Seas fleet
comes out for action the world will know the truth."</p>

<p>"Then hadn't it better come," Pamela suggested, "and clear
the ocean for your commerce?"</p>

<p>"That isn't the point," Fischer insisted. "We have wandered
from the main issue. I say that America abandons its neutrality
when it helps the Allies to continue the war."</p>

<p>"I don't think you will find," Pamela replied, "that
international law prevents any neutral country from supplying
either combatant with munitions. If one country can fetch the
things and the other can't, that is the misfortune of the
country that can't. For one moment look at the matter from
England's point of view. She has built up a mighty navy to keep
the seas clear for exactly this purpose&mdash;to continue her
commerce from abroad. Germany instead has built up a mighty
army, with which she has overrun Europe. Germany has had the
advantage from her army. Why shouldn't England have the
advantage from her navy?"</p>

<p>"Let me ask you the question you asked me a few minutes ago,"
her companion begged. "Were you born in America&mdash;or
England?"</p>

<p>"I was born in America," Pamela told him; "so were my parents
and my grandparents. I claim to be American to the backbone. I
claim even to treat any sympathies I might have in this affair
as prejudices, and not even to allow them a single corner in my
brain."</p>

<p>Mr. Fischer sat quite still for several moments. He was
struggling very hard to keep his temper. In the end he
succeeded.</p>

<p>"We will not, then, pursue the subject of America's
neutrality," he said, "because it is obvious that we disagree
fundamentally. But tell me this, now, as an American and a
patriot. Which do you think would be better for America&mdash;
That Germany and Austria won this war, or the Allies?"</p>

<p>"Upon that question I have not altogether made up my mind,"
Pamela confessed.</p>

<p>"Then there is room there for a discussion," Mr. Fischer
pointed out eagerly. "I should like to put my views before you
on this matter."</p>

<p>"And I should love to hear them," Pamela replied, "but I feel
just now as though we had talked enough politics. Do you know
that I came up on deck in a state of great agitation?"</p>

<p>"Submarine alarms from the stewardess?" Mr. Fischer
suggested.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of submarines, but I have a most profound
dislike for thieves," Pamela declared.</p>

<p>"You have not had anything stolen?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>"I have not," Pamela replied, "but the only reason seems to
be that I have nothing worth stealing. When I got back from
luncheon this afternoon I found that my stateroom had been
systematically searched."</p>

<p>She turned her head a little lazily and looked at her
neighbour. His expression was entirely sympathetic.</p>

<p>"Your jewellery?"</p>

<p>"Deposited with the purser."</p>

<p>"I congratulate you," he said.</p>

<p>"Nothing has been stolen," she observed, "but one hates the
feeling of insecurity, all the same. Both my steward and
stewardess are old friends. It must have been a very clever
person who found his way into my room."</p>

<p>"A very clever person," Mr. Fischer objected, "would have
known that you had deposited your jewels with the purser."</p>

<p>"If it was my jewels of which they were in search," Pamela
murmured. "By the bye, do you remember all that fuss about the
disappearance of a young soldier that morning at Henry's?"</p>

<p>Fischer nodded.</p>

<p>"I heard something about it," he confessed. "They were
talking about it at dinner-time."</p>

<p>"I had an idea that you might be interested," Pamela went on.
"He was rather a foolish young man. He came into the restaurant
telling every one at the top of his voice that he had made a
great discovery! Even in London, which is, I should think, the
most prosaic city in the world, there must be people who are on
the lookout to pick up war secrets."</p>

<p>"Even in London, as you remark," Fischer assented.</p>

<p>"You didn't hear the end of the affair, I suppose?" she asked
him.</p>

<p>The steward had arrived with afternoon tea. Fischer threw
into the sea the cigar which he had been smoking.</p>

<p>"I do not think," he said, "that the end has been reached
yet."</p>

<p>Pamela sighed.</p>

<p>"Les oreilles ennemies!" she quoted. "I suppose one has to be
careful everywhere."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="first">IT was one evening towards the end of the
voyage, and about an hour after dinner. A huge form loomed out
of the darkness, continuing its steady promenade along the unlit
portion of the deck. Pamela, moved by some caprice, abandoned
her caution of the last few days and called out.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fischer!"</p>

<p>He stopped short. The sparks flew from the red end of his
cigar, which he tossed into the sea. He hastened towards
her.</p>

<p>"Miss Van Teyl?" he replied, a little hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"How clever of you to know my voice!" she observed. "I am in
the humour to talk. Will you sit down, please?"</p>

<p>Mr. Fischer humbly drew a chair to her side.</p>

<p>"I had an idea," he said, "that you had been avoiding me the
last two or three days."</p>

<p>"I have," she admitted.</p>

<p>"Have I offended you, then?"</p>

<p>"Scarcely that," she replied, "only, you see, it seemed waste
of time to talk to you with the foils on, and a little
dangerous, perhaps, to talk to you with them off."</p>

<p>His face reflected his admiration.</p>

<p>"Miss Van Teyl," he declared, "you are quite a wonderful
person. I have never believed very much in women before. Perhaps
that is the reason why I have never married."</p>

<p>"Dear me, are you a woman-hater?" she asked.</p>

<p>He looked at her steadfastly.</p>

<p>"I have made use of women as playthings," he confessed.
"Until I met you I never thought of them as companions, as
partners."</p>

<p>She laughed at him through the darkness, and at the sound of
her laugh his eyes glowed.</p>

<p>"Really, I am very much flattered," she said. "You give me
credit for intelligence, then?"</p>

<p>"I give you credit for every gift a woman should have," he
answered enthusiastically. "I recognise in you the woman I have
sometimes dreamed of."</p>

<p>Again she laughed.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me, Mr. Fischer," she protested, "that ever in
your practical life you have spent a single moment in
dreams?"</p>

<p>"I have spent many," he assured her, "but they have all been
since I knew you."</p>

<p>Pamela sighed.</p>

<p>"I have never been through a voyage," she observed, "without
a love affair. Still, I never suspected you, Mr. Fischer."</p>

<p>"You suspected me, perhaps, of other things."</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"I am full of suspicions about you," she admitted. "I am not
going to tell you what they are, of course."</p>

<p>"There is one thing of which I am guilty," he confessed. "I
should like to tell you about it right now."</p>

<p>"Could I guess it?"</p>

<p>"You're clever enough."</p>

<p>"You like me, don't you, Mr. Fischer?"</p>

<p>"Better than any woman in the world," he answered promptly.
"And my confession is&mdash;well, just that. Will you marry
me?"</p>

<p>Pamela shook her head.</p>

<p>"Quite early in life," she confided, "I made up my mind that
I would never give a definite answer to any one who proposed to
me on a steamer. I suppose it's the wind, or is it the stars, or
the silence, or what? I have known the sanest of men, even like
you, Mr. Fischer, become quite maudlin."</p>

<p>"I am brimful of common sense at the present moment," he
declared earnestly. "You and I could do great things together,
if only I could get you to look at one certain matter from my
point of view; to see it as I see it."</p>

<p>"A political matter?" she inquired naively.</p>

<p>"I want to try and persuade you," he confessed, "that America
has everything in the world to gain from Germany's success, and
everything to lose if the Allies should triumph in this war and
Great Britain should continue her tyranny of the seas."</p>

<p>"It's an extraordinarily interesting subject," Pamela
admitted.</p>

<p>"It is almost as absorbing," he declared, "as the other
matter which just now lies even nearer to my heart."</p>

<p>She withdrew her fingers from his sudden clutch.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fischer," she told him, "what I said just now was quite
final. I will not be made love to on a steamer."</p>

<p>"When we land," he continued eagerly, "you will be coming to
see your brother, won't you?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Of course! I am coming to the Plaza Hotel. That, I suppose,
is good news for you, Mr. Fischer."</p>

<p>"Of course it is," he answered, "but why do you say so?"</p>

<p>"It will give you so many opportunities," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Of seeing you?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Of searching my belongings."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. She heard his quick breath
through the darkness. His voice assumed its harsher tone.</p>

<p>"You believe that it was I who searched your stateroom?"</p>

<p>"I am sure that it was you, or some one acting for you."</p>

<p>"What is it, then, of which I am in search?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Captain Graham's formula," she replied. "I think you want
that a good deal more than you want me."</p>

<p>"You have it then?" he asked fiercely.</p>

<p>She sighed.</p>

<p>"You jump so to conclusions. I didn't say so."</p>

<p>"You went up the stairs ... you were the only person who went
up just at that one psychological moment! He had his pocketbook
with him when he came in&mdash; he told Holderness so."</p>

<p>"And when you searched him it was gone," she remarked calmly.
"Dear me!"</p>

<p>"How do you know that I searched him?" Fischer demanded.</p>

<p>"How dare you ask me to give away my secrets?" she
replied.</p>

<p>"Listen," he began, striving with an almost painful effort to
keep his voice down to the level of a whisper, "you and I
together, we could do the most marvellous things. I could let
you into all my schemes. They are great. They will be
successful. After the war is over&mdash;"</p>

<p>He held his breath for a moment. The tramp of approaching
footsteps warned him of the coming of an intruder. The Captain
came to a standstill before their chairs and saluted.</p>

<p>"Miss Van Teyl," he said, "there will be a mutiny in the
saloon if you don't come down and sing."</p>

<p>She almost sprang to her feet. The ship was rolling a little,
and she laid her fingers upon his arm.</p>

<p>"I meant to come long ago," she declared, "but Mr. Fischer
has been so interesting. You will finish telling me your
experiences another time, won't you?" she called out over her
shoulder. "There is so much that I still want to hear."</p>

<p>Fischer's reply was almost ungracious. He watched their
departure in silence, and afterwards leaned further back in his
chair. With long, nervous fingers he drew a black cigar from his
case and lit it. Then he folded his arms. For more than half an
hour he sat there motionless, smoking furiously. He looked out
into the chaos of the windy darkness, he heard voices riding
upon the seas, shrieking and calling to him, voices to which he
had been deaf too long. The burden of these later years of
turbulent, brazen, selfish struggling, rolled back. He had been
a sentimentalist once, a willing seeker after things which
seemed to have passed him by. At his age, he told himself, a man
should still find more than one place in the world.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="first">JAMES VAN TEYL glanced curiously at the small,
dark figure standing patiently before him, and then back again
at the wireless cable which he held in his fingers. He was just
back from a tiring day in Wall Street, and was reclining in the
most comfortable easy-chair of his Hotel Plaza sitting-room.</p>

<p>"Gee!" he murmured. "This beats me. The last thing I should
have thought we wanted here was a valet. The fellow who looks
after this suite has scarcely anything else to do. What did you
say your name was?"</p>

<p>"Nikasti, sir."</p>

<p>Van Teyl carefully reconsidered the cable. It certainly
seemed to leave no room for misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Please engage for our service, as valet, Nikasti. See that he
enters on his duties at once. Hope land this evening. Your
sister on board sends love.&mdash;F.</p>

<p>"Well that seems clear enough," the young man muttered,
thrusting the form into his waistcoat pocket. "You're here to
stay, I guess, Nikasti? I see you've brought your kit
along."</p>

<p>"In case you decided to engage me, sir," the man replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are engaged right enough," Van Teyl assured him.
"You'd better make the best job you can of putting out my
evening clothes. If you ring for the floor valet, he'll help
you. The bedrooms are through that door."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir!"</p>

<p>"I am going down to the barber's now," Van Teyl continued,
rising to his feet. "Just remember this, Nikasti&mdash;what a
name, by the bye!"</p>

<p>"I could be called Kato," the man suggested.</p>

<p>"Kato for me all the time," his prospective employer agreed.
"Well, listen. My sister, Miss Van Teyl, arrives from Europe on
the <i>Lapland</i> this evening. If she comes in or rings up,
say I'm here and I want to see her at once. You understand?"</p>

<p>"I understand, sir."</p>

<p>Van Teyl strolled out, and Kato disappeared into the inner
room. The floor valet, dressed in the dark blue livery of the
hotel, was already laying out his master's dinner clothes. He
eyed the intruder a little truculently.</p>

<p>"Who are you, anyway?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"My name is Nikasti," was the quiet reply. "Mr. Van Teyl has
engaged me as his valet, to wait upon him and Mr. Fischer."</p>

<p>The man laid down the shirt into which he was fixing the
studs.</p>

<p>"That's some news," he remarked bitterly.</p>

<p>"To wait on Mr. Van Teyl and Mr. Fischer, eh? What the hell
do they want you for?"</p>

<p>Nikasti shook his head slowly. He was very small, and his
dark eyes seemed filled with melancholy.</p>

<p>"It is not for a very long time," he ventured.</p>

<p>"Long enough to do me out of my five dollars' tip every
week," the man grumbled. "I'm a married man, too, and a good
American. Blast you fellows, coming and taking our jobs away!
Can't think what they let you into the country for."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," Nikasti murmured.</p>

<p>"Your sorrow don't bring me in my five dollars," the valet
retorted bitterly. "There's only two suites on this floor to
work for, anyway, and this is the only one worth a cent."</p>

<p>"I am taking the situation," the other explained, "for the
sake of experience. I do not wish to rob you of your earnings. I
will pay you the five dollars a week while I stay here. You
shall help me with the work."</p>

<p>"That's a deal, my little yellow-skinned kid," the valet
agreed in a tone of relief. "I'll show you where the things are
kept."</p>

<p>His new coadjutor bowed.</p>

<p>"The telephone is ringing in the master's room," he observed.
"You shall remain here, and I will answer it."</p>

<p>"That goes, Jappy," the man acquiesced. "If it's a young lady
take her name, but don't say that Mr. Van Teyl's about. Forward
young baggages some of them are."</p>

<p>Nikasti glided from the room, closed the door, and approached
the telephone receiver.</p>

<p>"Yes," he acknowledged, "these are the rooms of Mr. Van
Teyl... No, madam, Mr. Van Teyl is not in at present."</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause. Nikasti's face was impenetrable
as he listened, but his eyes glowed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand, madam," he said softly. "You are Miss Van
Teyl, and you wish to speak to your brother. The moment Mr. Van
Teyl returns I will ring you up or fetch you."</p>

<p>He replaced the receiver upon its hook, and returned to the
bedroom. For some little time he was initiated into the
mysteries of his new master's studs, boots and shoes, and
general taste in wearing apparel. Then the latter entered the
sitting-room, and Nikasti obeyed his summons.</p>

<p>"Anyone called me up?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"No one, sir."</p>

<p>Van Teyl glanced at the clock in an undecided manner.</p>

<p>"I'll change right away," he decided. "Just set things to
rights in here, fill my cigarette case, and hang round by the
telephone."</p>

<p>Nikasti bowed, and the young man disappeared into the inner
room. His new attendant waited until the door was closed. Then
he removed the receiver from its hook, laid it upon the table,
and moved stealthily towards the open fireplace. For several
moments he remained in an attitude of listening, then with
quick, lithe fingers he drew from his pocket a cable dispatch,
reread it with an air of complete absorption, and committed it
to the flames. He watched it burn, and turned away from the
contemplation of its grey ashes with a sigh of content. Suddenly
he started. The door of the sitting-room had been opened and
closed. A tall, broad-shouldered man, wearing gold-rimmed
spectacles, a long travelling coat and a Homburg hat, was
standing watching him. Nikasti was only momentarily disturbed.
His look of gentle inquiry was perfect.</p>

<p>"You wish to see my master&mdash;Mr. Van Teyl?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" Fischer demanded.</p>

<p>"He is dressing in the next apartment. I will take him your
name."</p>

<p>Fischer threw his coat and hat upon the table.</p>

<p>"That'll do directly," he replied. "So you're Nikasti?"</p>

<p>They looked at one another for a moment. The face of the
Japanese was smooth, bland, and imperturbable. His eyes were
innocent even of any question. Fischer's forehead was wrinkled,
and his brows drawn close together.</p>

<p>"I am Nikasti," the other acknowledged&mdash;"Kato Nikasti.
Mr. Van Teyl has just engaged me as his valet."</p>

<p>"You can take off the gloves," Fischer told him. "I am Oscar
Fischer."</p>

<p>"Oscar Fischer," Nikasti repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes! ... Burning something when I came in weren't you?
Looked like a cable, eh?"</p>

<p>"A dispatch from London," Nikasti confided.</p>

<p>"Nothing that would interest me, eh?"</p>

<p>"It was a family message," was the calm response. "It did not
concern the affair which is between us."</p>

<p>"How came you to speak English like this?" Fischer
inquired.</p>

<p>"I was at Oxford University for two years," Nikasti told him,
"and in the Embassy at London for five more."</p>

<p>"Before you took up your present job, eh?"</p>

<p>Nikasti assented silently. Fischer glanced around as though
to make sure that they were still alone.</p>

<p>"I have the communication with me," he announced, "which we
are to discuss. The terms of our proposal are clearly set out,
and they are signed by the Highest of all himself. The letter
embodying them was handed to me three weeks ago to-day in
Berlin. Have you been to Washington?"</p>

<p>Nikasti shook his head.</p>

<p>"I do not go to Washington," he said. "You will understand
that diplomatically, as you would put it, I do not exist.
Neither is it necessary. I am here to listen."</p>

<p>Fischer nodded.</p>

<p>"There need be very little delay, then," he observed, "before
we get to work."</p>

<p>Nikasti bowed and raised his forefinger in warning.</p>

<p>"I think," he whispered, "that Mr. Van Teyl has finished
dressing."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="first">VAN TEYL, as he hastened forward to meet his
friend, presented at first sight a very good type of the
well-groomed, athletic young American. He was over six feet tall,
with smooth, dark hair brushed back from his forehead, a strong,
clean-shaven face and good features. Only, as he drew nearer,
there was evident a slight, unnatural quivering at the corner of
his lips. The cordiality of his greeting, too, was a little
overdone.</p>

<p>"Welcome home, Fischer! Why, man, you're looking fine. Had a
pleasant voyage?"</p>

<p>"Storms for the first few days&mdash;after that all right,"
Fischer replied.</p>

<p>"Any submarines?"</p>

<p>"Not a sight of one. Seen your sister yet?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. I've been waiting about for a telephone message.
She hadn't arrived, a few minutes ago."</p>

<p>Fischer frowned.</p>

<p>"I want us three to meet&mdash;you and she and I&mdash;the
first moment she sets foot in the hotel," he declared.</p>

<p>"What's the hurry?" Van Teyl demanded. "You must have seen
plenty of her the last ten days."</p>

<p>"That," Fischer insisted, "was a different matter. See here,
Jimmy, I'll be frank with you."</p>

<p>He walked to the door of the bedroom, opened it, and looked
inside. Its sole occupant was Nikasti, who was at the far end,
putting away some clothes. Fischer closed the door firmly and
returned.</p>

<p>"I want you to understand this, James," he began. "Your
sister is meddling in certain things she'd best leave
alone."</p>

<p>Van Teyl lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"No use talking to me," he observed. "Pamela's her own
mistress, and she's gone her own way ever since she came of
age."</p>

<p>"She's got to quit," Fischer pronounced. "That's all there is
about it. You and I will have to talk this out. Where are you
dining?"</p>

<p>"Downstairs," Van Teyl replied gloomily. "I was thinking of
waiting for Pamela."</p>

<p>"You leave word to have your people let you know directly she
arrives," Fischer advised, "and come along with me."</p>

<p>Van Teyl allowed himself to be led towards the door. Nikasti,
with a due sense of his new duties, glided past them, rang for
the lift, and watched them descend. Fischer turned at once
towards the dining room.</p>

<p>"Thank God we're in a civilised country," he observed, "and
that I don't have to change when I don't want to!"</p>

<p>They found a quiet table, and Fischer, displaying much
interest in the menu, ordered a somewhat extensive dinner.</p>

<p>"Grapefruit and Maryland chicken are worth coming back to,"
he declared. "Now see here, James, let's get to business. You've
got to help me with your sister."</p>

<p>"But how?" Van Teyl demanded. "Pamela and I are good pals, of
course, but she has a will of her own in all she does, and I
don't fancy that anything I could say would influence her very
much."</p>

<p>"There are two things about your sister," Fischer continued.
"The first is that she's got to quit this secret service
business she's got herself mixed up in."</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense!" Van Teyl exclaimed. "Pamela doesn't
care a fig about politics."</p>

<p>Fischer grunted scornfully.</p>

<p>"You don't know much about your sister, young fellow," he
said. "Internal politics over here may not interest her a cent,
but she's crazy about America as a country, and she's shrewd
enough to see things coming that a great many of you over here
aren't looking for. Anyway, she came bang up against me in a
little scheme I had on the night before I left Europe, and
somewhere about her she's got concealed a document which I'd
gladly buy for a quarter of a million dollars."</p>

<p>Van Teyl drank off his second cocktail.</p>

<p>"Some money!" he observed. "How did she come by the
prize?"</p>

<p>"Played up for it, just as I did," Fischer replied. "She was
clever enough to make use of my scaffolding, and got up the
ladder first. I'm not squealing, but I've got to have that
document, whatever it costs me."</p>

<p>Van Teyl was silent for a moment. There was an undercurrent
of something threatening in his companion's manner, of which he
had taken note.</p>

<p>"And the second thing you mentioned?" he asked. "What is
that?"</p>

<p>Fischer, as though to give due emphasis to his statement,
indulged in a brief pause. Then he leaned a little forward and
spoke very slowly and very forcibly.</p>

<p>"I want to marry her," he declared.</p>

<p>Van Teyl learned back in his chair and gazed at his vis-a-vis
in blank astonishment.</p>

<p>"You must be a damned fool, Fischer!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You think so?" was the unruffled reply. "I wonder why?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why, if you want to know," Van Teyl continued
bluntly. "I know of four of the richest and best-looking young
men in America, two ambassadors, an English peer, and an Italian
prince, who have proposed to Pamela during the last twelve
months alone. She refused every one of them."</p>

<p>"Well," Fischer remarked, "she must marry some time."</p>

<p>Van Teyl looked at him insolently.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think you'd have a dog's chance," he
pronounced.</p>

<p>There was a little glitter behind Fischer's spectacles.</p>

<p>"Up till now," he admitted smoothly, "I have not been
fortunate. I must confess, however, that I was hoping for your
good offices."</p>

<p>"Pamela wouldn't take the slightest notice of anything I
might say," Van Teyl declared. "Besides, I should hate you to
marry her."</p>

<p>"A little blunt, are you not, my young friend?" Fischer
remarked amiably. "Still, to continue, there is also the matter
of that document. I must confess that I exercised all my
ingenuity to obtain possession of it on the steamer."</p>

<p>"You would!" Van Teyl muttered.</p>

<p>"Your sister, however," Fischer continued, "was wise enough
to have it locked up in the purser's safe the moment she set
foot upon the steamer. She gave me the slip when she got it
back, and eluded me, somehow, on the quay. She will scarcely
have had time to part with it yet, though. When she arrives here
to-night, it will in all probability be in her possession."</p>

<p>"Well?" Van Teyl demanded. "You don't suggest that I should
rob her of it, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," Fischer replied. "On the other hand, you might
very well induce her to give it up voluntarily, or at least to
treat with me."</p>

<p>"You don't know Pamela," was Van Teyl's curt reply.</p>

<p>"I know her sufficiently," Fischer went on, leaning over the
table, "to believe that she would sacrifice a great deal to save
her brother from Sing Sing."</p>

<p>Van Teyl took the thrust badly. He started as though he had
been stabbed, and his face became almost ghastly in its pallor.
He tossed off a glass of wine hastily.</p>

<p>"Just what do you mean by that?" he asked thickly.</p>

<p>"Are you prepared," Fischer continued, "to have me visit your
office to-morrow morning and examine my accounts and securities
in the presence of your partners?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" Van Teyl faltered. "What the hell do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean, James Van Teyl," his companion declared, "that I
should find you a matter of a hundred thousand dollars short. I
mean that you've realised on some of my securities, gambled on
your own account with the proceeds, and lost. You did this as
regards one stock at least, with a forged transfer, which I
hold."</p>

<p>Van Teyl looked almost piteously around. Life seemed suddenly
to have become an unreal thing&mdash;the crowds of well-dressed
diners, the gentle splashing of the water from the fountains in
the winter garden, the distant murmuring of music from behind
the canopy of palms. So this was the end of it! All that week he
had hoped against hope. He had been told of a sure thing. Next
week he had meant to have a great gamble. Everything was to have
gone his way, after all. And now it was too late. Fischer knew,
and Fischer was a cruel man!...</p>

<p>The unnatural silence came to an end. Only Fischer's voice
seemed to come from a long way off.</p>

<p>"Drink your wine, James Van Teyl," he advised, "and listen to
me. You've been under obligations to me from the start. I meant
you to be. I brought a great business to your firm, and I
insisted upon having you interested. I had a motive, as I have
for most things I do. You are well placed socially in New York,
and I am not. You are also above suspicion, which I am not. It
suited me to take this suite in the Plaza, nominally in our
joint names, but to pay the whole account myself. It suited me
because I required the shelter of your social position. You
understand?"</p>

<p>"I always understand," Van Teyl muttered.</p>

<p>"Just so. Only, whereas you simply thought me a snob, I had
in reality a different and very definite purpose. We come now,
however, to your present obligation to me. I can, if I choose,
tear up your forged transfer, submit to the loss of my money,
and leave you secure. I shall do so if you are able to induce
your sister to hand over to me those few lines of
writing&mdash;to which, believe me, she has no earthly
right&mdash;and to accept me as a prospective suitor."</p>

<p>Van Teyl was drinking steadily now, but every mouthful of
food seemed almost to choke him. Red-eyed and defiant, he faced
his torturer.</p>

<p>"You're talking rot!" he declared. "Pamela wouldn't marry you
if you were the last man on earth, and if she's got anything she
wants to keep, she'll keep it."</p>

<p>"And see her brother disgraced," Fischer reminded him, "tried
at the Criminal Court for theft and sent to Sing Sing? It's a
good name in New York, yours, you know. The Van Teyls have held
up their heads high for more than one generation. Your sister
will not fancy seeing it dragged down into the mire."</p>

<p>For a single moment the young man seemed about to throw
himself upon his companion, Fischer, perfectly unmoved, watched
him, nevertheless, like a cat.</p>

<p>"Better sit tight," he enjoined. "Drop it now or people will
be watching us. I have ordered some of the old brandy. A liqueur
or two will steady you, perhaps. Afterwards we will go upstairs
and take your sister into our confidence."</p>

<p>Van Teyl nodded.</p>

<p>"Very well," he agreed hoarsely. "We'll hear what Pamela has
to say."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="first">NIKASTI, with a low bow, watched the
disappearance of the lift into which his two new masters, James
Van Teyl and Oscar Fischer, had stepped. He waited until the
indicator registered its safe arrival on the ground floor. Then
he slowly retraced his steps along the corridor, entered the
sitting-room, and took up the telephone receiver, which was
still lying upon the table.</p>

<p>"Will you give me number 77," he asked&mdash;"Miss Van Teyl's
suite?"</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence&mdash;then a voice at the other
end to which he made obeisance.</p>

<p>"It is Miss Van Teyl who speaks? I am Mr. Van Teyl's valet.
Mr. Van Teyl is here now and will be glad if you will come
in."</p>

<p>He replaced the receiver, listened and waited. In a few
moments there was the sound of a light footstep outside. The
door was opened and Pamela entered. She was still wearing the
grey tailor-made costume in which she had left the steamer.</p>

<p>"Why, where is Mr. Van Teyl?" she asked, looking around the
room. "I have been ringing up for the last ten minutes and
couldn't get any answer. I did not realise that it was the next
suite."</p>

<p>"Mr. Van Teyl is close at hand, madam," Nikasti replied. "If
you will kindly be seated, I will fetch him."</p>

<p>"How long have you been valet here?" Pamela asked
curiously.</p>

<p>"For a few hours only, madam," was the grave reply. "If you
will be so good as to wait."</p>

<p>He bowed low and left the room. Pamela took up an evening
paper and for a few minutes buried herself in its contents. Then
suddenly she held it away from her and listened. A queer and
unaccountable impulse inspired her with a certain mistrust.
There was no sound of movement in the adjoining bedchamber, nor
any sign of her brother's presence. She opened the door and
peered in. It was empty and in darkness. Then, moved by that
same unaccountable impulse, she crossed the room and listened at
the door which led into her own suite, and which she perceived
was bolted on this side as well as her own. She listened at
first idly, afterwards breathlessly. In a few moments she was
convinced that her senses were not playing her false. Some one
was moving stealthily about in her room, the key to which was
even at that moment in her hand. She hastened to the door, to be
confronted by another surprise. The handle turned but the door
refused to open. She was locked in.</p>

<p>Pamela was both generous and insistent in the matter of
bells. She found four, and she rang them all together. The
consequences were speedy, and in their way satisfactory. Nikasti
himself, a breathless chambermaid, a hurt but dignified waiter,
and the floor valet, who had not even stopped to put on his
coat, entered together. They seemed a little stupefied at
finding Pamela alone and no sign of any disturbance.</p>

<p>"Why was I locked in here?" Pamela demanded indignantly,
taking them en bloc.</p>

<p>There was a little chorus of non-comprehension. Nikasti
stepped forward, waved to the others to be silent, and bowed
almost to the ground.</p>

<p>"It was a mistake easily to be understood, madam," he
explained. "The handle is a little stiff, perhaps, but the door
was not locked. We all reached here together, I myself barely a
yard in advance. No key was used&mdash;and behold!"</p>

<p>Pamela was disposed to argue, but a moment's reflection
induced her to change her mind. This falsehood of Nikasti's was
at least interesting. She waved the hotel servants away.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to have troubled you," she said. "I will remember
it when I pay my bill."</p>

<p>They took their leave, Nikasti showing them out. When the
last had departed, he turned back to the centre table, from the
other side of which Pamela was watching him curiously.</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine," she remarked, "how I could have made such
a mistake about the door. I tried it twice or three times and it
certainly seemed to me to be locked."</p>

<p>Nikasti moved a step nearer towards her. Something of the
servility of his manner had gone. For the first time she looked
at him closely, appreciated the tense immobility of his
features, the still, penetrating light of his cold eyes. A queer
premonition of trouble for a moment unsteadied her.</p>

<p>"There was no mistake," he said softly. "The door was
locked."</p>

<p>Even then she did not fully understand the position. She
leaned a little towards him.</p>

<p>"It was locked?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"I locked it," he told her. "It is locked now, securely. I
have been searching in your room for something which I did not
find. I think that you had better give it to me. It will save
trouble."</p>

<p>"Are you mad?" she demanded breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Do I seem so?" he replied. "There is no person more sane
than I. I require from you the formula of the new explosive,
which you stole in Henry's restaurant eleven days ago."</p>

<p>The sense of mystery passed. It was simply trouble of the
ordinary sort from an unexpected source.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" she murmured. "Every one seems interested in my
little adventure. How did you hear about it?"</p>

<p>"I destroyed the cable telling me of all that happened only a
few minutes ago," he explained. "It was the foolish talk of the
young inventor which gave his secret to the world to scramble
for."</p>

<p>"It was very clever of your informant," she remarked, "to
suggest that I was the fortunate thief. Why not Oscar Fischer?
It was his plot, not mine."</p>

<p>The eyes of the little Japanese seemed suddenly to narrow. He
realised quite well that she was talking simply to gain
time.</p>

<p>"Madam," he insisted, "the formula. It is for my country, and
for my country I would risk much."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt it," she replied; "but if I hold it, I hold
it for my country, too, and there is nothing you would risk for
Japan from which I should shrink for America."</p>

<p>He laid his hands upon the table. She turned her ring and
clenched her hand. She could see his spring coming, realised in
those few seconds that here was an opponent of more desperate
and subtle calibre than Joseph. Whether her wits might have
failed her, fate remained her friend. There was a knock at the
door.</p>

<p>"You hear?" she cried breathlessly. "There is some one there.
Shall I call out?"</p>

<p>His hands and knee were gone from the table. He was once more
his old self, so completely the servant that for a moment even
Pamela was puzzled. It seemed as though the events of the last
few seconds might have been part of a disordered dream. Nikasti
played to the cue of her fevered question and entirely ignored
them. He opened the door with a respectful flourish&mdash;and
John Lutchester walked in.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="first">PAMELA'S first shock of surprise did not
readily pass. In the first place, John Lutchester's appearance
in America at all was entirely unexpected. In the second, by
what possible means could he have arrived at this precise and
psychological moment?</p>

<p>"You!" she exclaimed, a little helplessly. "Mr.
Lutchester!"</p>

<p>He smiled as he shook hands. Nikasti had slipped noiselessly
from the room. Pamela made no effort to detain him. She had a
curious feeling that the things which had passed between them
concerned their two selves only. So had no desire whatever to
hand him over to retributive justice.</p>

<p>"You are surprised," he observed. "So far as my presence here
is concerned, I knew quite well that I was coming some time ago,
but it was one of those matters, you understand, Miss Van Teyl,
that one is scarcely at liberty to talk about. I am here in
connection with my work."</p>

<p>"Your work," she repeated weakly. "I thought that you were in
the Ministry of Munitions?"</p>

<p>"Precisely," he admitted. "I have a travelling inspectorship.
You see, I don't mind telling you this, but it is just as well,
if you will forgive my mentioning it, Miss Van Teyl, that these
things are not spoken of to any one. My business over here is
supposed to be secret. I am going round some of the factories
from which we are drawing supplies."</p>

<p>She drew a long breath and began to feel a little more like
herself.</p>

<p>"Well, after this," she declared, "I shall be surprised at
nothing. I have had one shock already this evening, and you are
the second."</p>

<p>"The first, I trust, was not disagreeable?"</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Without flattering you," she answered, "I think I could say
that I prefer the second."</p>

<p>"I had an idea," Lutchester remarked diffidently, "that my
arrival seemed either opportune or inopportune&mdash;I could not
quite tell which. Were you in any way troubled or embarrassed by
the presence of the little Japanese gentleman?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," she replied. "Why, he is Jimmy's valet."</p>

<p>"How absurd of me!" Lutchester murmured. "By the bye, if
Jimmy is your brother&mdash;Mr. Van Teyl&mdash;I have a letter
to him from a pal in town&mdash;Dicky Green. It was to present
it that I found my way up here this evening. I was told that he
might put me in the way of a little golf during my spare time
over here."</p>

<p>He produced the note and laid it upon the table. Pamela
glanced at it and then at Lutchester. He was carefully dressed
in dinner clothes, black tie and white waistcoat. He was, as
usual, perfectly groomed and immaculate. He had what she could
only describe to herself as an everyday air about him. He seemed
entirely free from any mental pressure or the wear and tear of
great events.</p>

<p>"Golf?" she repeated wonderingly. "You expect to have a
little spare time, then?"</p>

<p>"Well, I hope so," Lutchester replied. "One must have
exercise. By the bye," he went on, "is your brother in, do you
happen to know? Perhaps it would be more convenient if I came
round in the morning? I am staying in the hotel."</p>

<p>"Oh, for goodness sake, don't go away," she begged. "Jimmy
will be here presently, for certain. To tell you the truth, we
have been rather playing hide-and-seek this evening, but it
hasn't been altogether his fault. Please sit down over
there&mdash;you will find cigarettes on the sideboard&mdash;and
talk to me."</p>

<p>"Delighted," he agreed, taking the chair opposite to her. "I
suppose you want to know what became of poor Graham?"</p>

<p>A sudden bewilderment appeared in her face. She leaned
towards him. Her forehead was knitted, her eyes puzzled. There
was a new problem to be solved.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Lutchester," she demanded, "how on earth did you
get here?"</p>

<p>"Across the Atlantic," he replied amiably. "Bit too far the
other way round."</p>

<p>"Yes, but what on?" she persisted. "I went straight on to the
<i>Lapland</i> after we parted last week, and only arrived here
an hour or so ago. There was no other passenger steamer sailing
for three days."</p>

<p>"I was a stowaway," he told her confidentially&mdash;"helped
to shovel coals all the way over."</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense!" she protested a little sharply. "I
dislike mysteries. Look at you! A stowaway, indeed! Tell me the
truth at once?"</p>

<p>He leaned forward in his chair towards her. An ingenuous
smile parted his lips. He had the air of a schoolboy repeating a
mischievous secret.</p>

<p>"The fact is, Miss Van Teyl," he confided, "I don't want it
talked about, you know, but I had a joy ride over."</p>

<p>"A what?"</p>

<p>"A joy ride," he repeated. "A cousin of mine is in command of
a destroyer, and she was under orders to sail for New York. He
hadn't the slightest right, really, to bring a passenger, as she
was coming over on a special mission, but I had word about the
trip over here, so I slipped on board late one night&mdash;not a
word to any one, you understand&mdash;and&mdash;well, here I am.
A more awful voyage," he went on impressively, "you couldn't
imagine. I was sore all over within twenty-four hours of
starting. There's practically no deck on those things, you know,
for sitting out or anything of that sort. The British Navy's
nowhere for comfort, I can tell you. The biggest liner for me,
going back!"</p>

<p>Pamela was still a little dazed. Lutchester's story did not
sound in the least convincing. For the moment, however, she
accepted his account of himself.</p>

<p>"Tell me now," she begged, "about Captain Graham?"</p>

<p>"You haven't heard, then?"</p>

<p>"I have heard nothing. How should I hear?"</p>

<p>"I took him straight back to my rooms after we left you,"
Lutchester began. "He was in an awful state of nerves and drugs
and drink. Then I put him to bed as soon as I could, and rang up
a pal of mine at the War Office to take him in hand."</p>

<p>"Do you believe," she asked curiously, "that he had really
been robbed of his formula?"</p>

<p>"Those amiable people who were interviewing him in the chapel
seemed to think so," Lutchester observed.</p>

<p>"But you! What do you think?" she persisted. He smiled in
superior fashion.</p>

<p>"I find it rather hard to bring myself to believe that any
one would take the trouble," he confided. "I have heard it said
in my department that there have been thirty-one new explosives
invented since the beginning of the war. Two of them only are in
use, and they're not much better than the old stuff."</p>

<p>Pamela nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>"All the same," she remarked, "I am not at all sure that was
the case with Captain Graham's invention. There were rumours for
days before that something wonderful was happening on Salisbury
Plain. They had to cover up whole acres of ground after his last
experiments, and a man who was down there told me that it seemed
just as though the life had been sucked out of it."</p>

<p>"Where did you collect all this information?" her visitor
inquired.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"One hears everything in London."</p>

<p>Lutchester was sitting with his finger-tips pressed together.
For a moment his attention seemed fixed upon them.</p>

<p>"There are things," he said, "which one hears, too, in the
far corners of the world&mdash;on the Atlantic, for
instance."</p>

<p>"You have had some news?" she interrupted.</p>

<p>"It is really a private piece of information," he told her,
"and it won't be in the papers&mdash;not the way the thing
happened, anyway&mdash;but I don't suppose there's any harm in
telling you, as we were both more or less mixed up in the
affair. Graham was shot the next day, on his way up to
Northumberland."</p>

<p>"Shot?" she exclaimed incredulously.</p>

<p>"Murdered, if you'd like the whole thrill," Lutchester
continued. "Of course, we didn't get many particulars in the
wireless, but we gathered that he was shot by some one passing
him in a more powerful car on a lonely stretch of the Great
North Road."</p>

<p>Pamela shuddered. She was for the moment profoundly
impressed. A certain air of unreality which had hung over the
events of that night was suddenly banished. The whole tragedy
rose up before her eyes. The effect of it was almost
stupefying.</p>

<p>"Gave me quite a shock," Lutchester confided. "Somehow or
other I had never been able to take that night quite seriously.
There was more than a dash of melodrama in it, wasn't there?
Seems now as though those fellows must have been in earnest,
though."</p>

<p>"And as though Captain Graham's formula," she reminded him
gravely, "was the real thing."</p>

<p>"Whereupon," Lutchester observed, "our first interest in the
affair receives a certain stimulus. Some one stole the formula.
To judge from the behaviour of those amiable gentlemen connected
with Henry's Restaurant, it wasn't they. Some one had been
before them. Have you any theories, Miss Van Teyl?"</p>

<p>"I can tell you who has," she replied. "Do you remember when
we were all grouped around that notice&mdash;<i>M&eacute;fiez-vous!
Taisez-vous! Les oreilles ennemies vous &eacute;coutent!</i>?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do," he assented.</p>

<p>"Do you remember Baron Sunyea making a remark afterwards? He
had been standing by and heard everything Graham said."</p>

<p>"Can't say that I do," Lutchester regretted, "but I remember
seeing him about the place."</p>

<p>"You promise to say or do nothing without my permission, if I
tell you something?" she went on.</p>

<p>"Naturally!"</p>

<p>"See, then, how diplomacy or secret service work, or whatever
you like to call it, can gather the ends of the world together!
Only a quarter of an hour ago that Japanese valet of my
brother's, having searched my rooms in vain, demanded from me
that formula!"</p>

<p>"From you?" Lutchester gasped. "But you haven't got it!"</p>

<p>"Of course not. On the other hand Sunyea pitched upon me as
being one of the possible thieves, and cabled his instructions
over."</p>

<p>"Have you got it?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"If I had," she smiled, "I should not tell you."</p>

<p>"But come," he expostulated, "the thing's no use to you."</p>

<p>"So Baron Sunyea evidently thought," she laughed. "We'll
leave that, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>Lutchester was still looking a little bewildered.</p>

<p>"I had an idea when I came in," he muttered, "that things
were a little scrappy between you and the Japanese
gentleman."</p>

<p>She was suddenly serious.</p>

<p>"Now that I have told you the truth," she said, "I really
ought to thank you. You certainly seem to have a knack of
appearing when you are wanted."</p>

<p>"Fluke this time, I'm afraid," he acknowledged, "but I rather
like the suggestion. You ought to see a great deal of me, Miss
Van Teyl. Do you realise that I am a stranger in New York, and
any hospitality you can show me may be doubly rewarded? Are you
going to take me round and show me the sights?"</p>

<p>"Are you going to have any time for sight-seeing?"</p>

<p>"Well, I hope so. Why not? A fellow can't do more than a
certain number of hours' work in a day."</p>

<p>She looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>"And yet," she murmured, "you expect to win the war!"</p>

<p>"Of course we shall win the war," he assured her confidently.
"You haven't any doubt about that yourself, have you, Miss Van
Teyl?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she told him calmly.</p>

<p>Lutchester was almost horrified. He rose to his feet and
stood looking down at his companion.</p>

<p>"Tell me what on earth you mean?" he demanded. "We always win
in the long run, even if we muddle things about a little."</p>

<p>"I was just contrasting in my mind," she said thoughtfully,
"some of the Germans whom I have met since the war, with some of
the Englishmen. They are taking it very seriously, you know, Mr.
Lutchester. They don't find time for luncheon parties or
sight-seeing."</p>

<p>"That's just their way," he protested. "They turn themselves
into machines. They are what we used to call suckers at school,
but you can take my word for it that before next autumn they
will be on the run."</p>

<p>"You call them suckers," she observed. "That's because
they're always working, always studying, always experimenting.
Supposing they got hold of something like this new
explosive?"</p>

<p>"First of all," he told her, "I don't believe in it, and
secondly, if it exists, the formula isn't in their hands."</p>

<p>"Supposing it is in mine?" she suggested. "I might sell it to
them."</p>

<p>"I'd trust you all the time," he laughed lightheartedly. "I
can't see you giving a leg up to the Huns.... Will you lunch
with me at one o'clock to-morrow, please?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," she replied. "You must attend to your work,
whatever it is."</p>

<p>"That's all very well," he grumbled, "but every one has an
hour off for luncheon."</p>

<p>"People who win wars don't lunch," she declared severely.
"Here's Jimmy&mdash;I can hear his voice&mdash;and he's brought
some one up with him. I'll&mdash;let you know about lunch."</p>

<p>The door opened. James Van Teyl and Fischer entered
together.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="first">THE first few seconds after the entrance of the
two men were monopolised by the greetings of Pamela with her
brother. Fischer stood a little in the background, his eyes
fixed upon Lutchester. His brain was used to emergencies, but he
found himself here confronted by an unanswerable problem.</p>

<p>"Say, this is Mr. Lutchester, isn't it?" he inquired, holding
out his hand.</p>

<p>"The same," Lutchester assented politely. "We met at Henry's
some ten days ago, didn't we?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Lutchester has brought us a letter from Dicky Green,
Jimmy," Pamela explained, as she withdrew from her brother's
arms. "Quite unnecessary, as it happens, because I met him in
London just before we sailed."</p>

<p>"Very glad to meet you, Mr. Lutchester," Jimmy declared,
wringing his hand with American cordiality. "Dicky's an old pal
of mine&mdash;one of the best. We graduated in the same year
from Harvard."</p>

<p>Conversation for a few minutes was platitudinous. Van Teyl,
although he showed few signs of his recent excesses, was noisy
and boisterous, clutching at this brief escape from a situation
which he dreaded. Fischer on the other hand, remained in the
back-ground, ominously silent, thinking rapidly, speculating and
theorising as to the coincidence, if it were coincidence, of
finding Lutchester and Pamela together. He listened to the
former's polite conversation, never once letting his eyes wander
from his face. All his thoughts were concentrated upon one
problem. The mysterious escape of Sandy Graham, which had sent
him flying from the country, remained unsolved. Of Pamela's
share in it he had already his suspicions. Was it possible that
Lutchester was the other and the central figure in that
remarkable rescue? He waited his opportunity, and, during a
momentary lull in the cheerful conversation, broke in with his
first question.</p>

<p>"Say, Mr. Lutchester, you haven't any twin brother, have
you?"</p>

<p>"No brother at all," Lutchester admitted.</p>

<p>"Then, how did you get over here? You were at Henry's weren't
you, on the night the <i>Lapland</i> sailed? You didn't cross
with us, and there's no other steamer due for two days."</p>

<p>"Then I can't be here," Lutchester declared. "The thing's
impossible."</p>

<p>"Guess you'll have to explain, if you want to save me from a
sleepless night," Fischer persisted.</p>

<p>Lutchester smiled. He had the air of one enjoying the
situation immensely.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I have had to confess to Miss Van Teyl
here, so I may as well make a clean breast of it to you. To
every one else I meet in New York, I shall say that I came over
on the <i>Lapland</i>. I really came over on a destroyer."</p>

<p>Fischer's face seemed to become more set and grim than
ever.</p>

<p>"A British destroyer," he muttered to himself.</p>

<p>"It was kind of a joy ride," Lutchester explained
confidentially, "a cousin of mine who was in command came in to
see me and say good-by, just after I'd received my orders from
the head of my department to come out here on the next steamer,
and he smuggled me on board that night. Mum's the word, though,
if you please. We asked nobody's leave. It would have taken
about a month to have heard anything definite from the
Admiralty."</p>

<p>"A British destroyer come across the Atlantic, eh?" Mr.
Fischer muttered. "She must have come out on a special mission,
then, I imagine."</p>

<p>"That is not for me to say," Lutchester observed, with stiff
reticence.</p>

<p>Pamela suddenly and purposely intervened. She turned towards
Fischer.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lutchester brought some rather curious news," she
observed. "He got it by wireless. Do you remember all the fuss
there was about the disappearance of Captain Holderness' friend
at Henry's?"</p>

<p>"I heard something about it," he admitted grimly.</p>

<p>"Well, Captain Graham was in my party, so naturally I was
more interested than any one else. To all appearance he entered
Henry's Restaurant, walked up the stairs, and disappeared into
the skies. The place was ransacked everywhere for him, but he
never turned up. Well, the very next day he was murdered in a
motor-car on his way to Northumberland."</p>

<p>"Incredible!" Fischer murmured.</p>

<p>"Seems a queer set out," Lutchester remarked, "but it's quite
true. He was supposed to have discovered a marvellous new
explosive, the formula for which had been stolen. He was on his
way up to Northumberland to make fresh experiments."</p>

<p>"For myself I have little faith," Fischer observed, "in any
new explosives. In Germany they believe, I understand, that the
limit of destructiveness has been attained."</p>

<p>"The Germans should know," Lutchester admitted carelessly.
"I'm afraid they are still a good deal ahead of us in most
scientific matters. I will take the liberty, of calling some
time to-morrow, Miss Van Teyl, and hope I shall have the
pleasure of improving my acquaintance with your brother. Good
night, Mr. Fischer."</p>

<p>"Are you staying in the hotel?" the latter inquired.</p>

<p>"On the fifteenth floor," was the somewhat gloomy reply. "I
shan't be able to shave in front of the window without feeling
giddy. However, I suppose that's America. Good-by,
everybody."</p>

<p>With a little inclusive and farewell bow he disappeared. They
heard him make his way down the corridor and ring for the lift.
Rather a curious silence ensued, which was broken at last by
Pamela.</p>

<p>"Is that," she asked, throwing herself into an easy-chair and
selecting a cigarette, "just an ordinary type of a nice,
well-bred, unintelligent, self-sufficient Englishman, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or what?" Fischer asked, with interest.</p>

<p>Pamela watched the smoke curl from the end of her
cigarette.</p>

<p>"Well, I scarcely know how to finish," she confessed, "only
sometimes when I am talking to him I feel that he can scarcely
be as big a fool as he seems, and then I wonder. Jimmy," she
went on, shaking her head at him, "you're not looking well.
You've been sitting up too late and getting into bad habits
during my absence. Open confession, now, if you please. If it's
a girl, I shall give you my blessing."</p>

<p>Van Teyl groaned and said nothing. A foreboding of impending
trouble depressed Pamela. She turned towards Fischer and found
in his grim face confirmation of her fears.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Your brother will explain," Fischer replied. "It is better
that he should tell you everything."</p>

<p>"Everything?" she repeated. "What is there to tell. What have
you to do with my brother, anyway?" she added fiercely.</p>

<p>"You must not look at me as though I were in any way to blame
for what has happened," was the insistent reply. "On the
contrary, I have been very lenient with your brother. I am still
prepared to be lenient&mdash;upon certain conditions."</p>

<p>The light of battle was in Pamela's eyes. She fought against
the significance of the man's ominous words. This was his first
blow, then, and directed against her.</p>

<p>"I begin to understand," she said. "Please go on. Let me hear
everything."</p>

<p>Van Teyl had turned to the sideboard. He mixed and drank off
a whisky and soda. Then he swung around.</p>

<p>"I'll make a clean breast of it in a few words, Pamela," he
promised. "I've gambled with Fischer's money, lost it, forged a
transfer of his certificates to meet my liabilities, and I am in
his power. He could have me hammered and chucked into Sing Sing,
if he wanted to. That's all there is about it."</p>

<p class="caption">"I'll make a clean breast of it in a few words, Pamela," he promised.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>Pamela stood the shock well. She turned to Fischer.</p>

<p>"How much of this are you responsible for?" she asked.</p>

<p>"That," he objected, "is an impotent question. It is not I
who had the moulding of your brother's character. It is not I
who made him a forger and a weakling."</p>

<p>Van Teyl's arm was upraised. An oath broke from his lips.
Pamela seized him firmly and drew him away.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, James," she begged. "Let us hear what Mr. Fischer
is going to do about it."</p>

<p>"That depends upon you," was the cold reply.</p>

<p>Pamela stood at the head of the table, between the two men,
and laughed. Her brother had sunk into a chair, and his head had
dropped moodily upon his folded arms. She looked from one to the
other and a new sense of strength inspired her. She felt that if
she were not indeed entirely mistress of the situation, yet the
elements of triumph were there to her hand.</p>

<p>"This is living, at any rate," she declared. "First of all I
discover that your Japanese servant is a spy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nikasti!" Van Teyl interrupted furiously. "Blast him! I knew
that there was something wrong about that fellow, Fischer."</p>

<p>Fischer frowned.</p>

<p>"What's he been up to?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Well, to begin with," Pamela explained, "he searched my
room, then he locked me in here, and was proceeding to threaten
me when fortunately Mr. Lutchester arrived."</p>

<p>"Threaten you&mdash;what about?" Fischer demanded.</p>

<p>"He seemed to have an absurd idea," Pamela explained sweetly,
"that I might have somewhere concealed upon my person the
formula which was stolen from Captain Graham last Monday week at
Henry's Restaurant. It makes quite a small world of it, doesn't
it?"</p>

<p>"I will deal with Nikasti for this," Fischer promised, "if it
is true. Meanwhile?"</p>

<p>"No sooner have I got over that little shock," Pamela went
on, "than you turn up with this melodramatic story, and an offer
from Mr. Fischer, which I can read in his face. Really, I feel
that I shall hear the buzz of a cinema machine in a moment. How
much do you owe him, Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"Eighty-nine thousand dollars," the young man groaned.</p>

<p>"I'll write you a cheque to-morrow morning," Pamela promised.
"Will that do, Mr. Fischer?"</p>

<p>"It is the last thing I desire," was the calm reply.</p>

<p>"Really! Well, perhaps now you will come to the point.
Perhaps you will tell me what it is that you do want?"</p>

<p>"Stolen property," Fischer announced
deliberately&mdash;"stolen property, however, to which I have a
greater right than you."</p>

<p>She laughed at him mockingly.</p>

<p>"I think not, Mr. Fischer," she said. "You really don't
deserve it, you know."</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"Just see how you have bungled! You bait the trap, the poor
man walks into it, and you allow another to forestall you. Not
only that, but you actually allow Japan to come into the game,
and but for Mr. Lutchester's appearance we might both of us have
been left plant&eacute; l&agrave;. No, Mr. Fischer! You don't
deserve the formula, and you shall not have it. I'll pay my
brother's debt to you in dollars&mdash;no other way."</p>

<p>"Dollars," Mr. Fischer told her sternly, "will never buy the
forged transfer. Dollars will never keep your brother out of the
city police court or Sing Sing afterwards. There isn't much
future for a young man who has been through it."</p>

<p>Van Teyl was upon him suddenly with a low, murderous cry.
Fischer had no time to resist, no chance of success if he had
attempted it. He was borne backwards on to the lounge, his
assailant's hand upon his throat. The young man was beside
himself with drink and fury. The words poured from his lips,
incoherent, hot with rage.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;hound! You've made my life a hell! You've plotted
and schemed to get me into your power!... There! Do you feel the
life going out of you?... My sister, indeed! You!... You scum of
the earth! You ..."</p>

<p>"James!"</p>

<p>The sound of Pamela's voice unnerved him. His fit of passion
was spent. She dragged him easily away.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Jimmy!" she begged. "You can't settle
accounts like that."</p>

<br>

"Don't be a fool, Jimmy!" she begged. "You can't settle
accounts like that."</p>
</div>

<br>


<p>"Can't I?" he muttered. "If we'd been alone, Pamela ... my
God, if he and I had been alone here!"</p>

<p>"Jimmy," she said, "you're a fool, and you've been drinking.
Fetch the water bottle."</p>

<p>He obeyed, and she dashed water in Fischer's face. Presently
he opened his eyes, groaned and sat up. There were two livid
marks upon his throat. Van Teyl watched him like a crouching
animal. His eyes were still lit with sullen fire. The lust for
killing was upon him. Fischer sat up and blinked. He felt the
atmosphere of the room, and he knew his danger. His hand stole
into his hip pocket, and a small revolver suddenly flashed upon
his knees. He drew a long breath of relief. He was like a
fugitive who had found sanctuary.</p>

<p>"So that's the game, James Van Teyl, is it?" he exclaimed.
"Now listen."</p>

<p>He adjusted the revolver with a click. His cruel, long
fingers were pressed around its stock.</p>

<p>"I am not threatening you," he went on. "I am not fond of
violence, and I don't believe in it. This is just in case you
come a single yard nearer to me. Now, Miss Van Teyl, my business
is with you. We won't fence any longer. You will hand over to me
the pocketbook which you stole from Captain Graham in Henry's
Restaurant. Hand it over to me intact, you understand. In return
I will give you the forged transfer of stock, and leave it to
your sense of honour as to whether you care to pay your
brother's debt or not. If you decline to consider my
proposition, I shall ring up Joseph Neville, your brother's
senior partner. I shall not even wait for to-morrow, mind. I
shall make an appointment, and I shall place in his hands the
proof of your brother's robbery."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," Pamela murmured, "I was wrong to stop you.
Jimmy.... Anything else, Mr. Fischer?"</p>

<p>"Just this. I would rather have carried this matter through
in a friendly fashion, for reasons at which I think you can
guess."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"You flatter my intelligence!" she told him scornfully.</p>

<p>"I will explain, then. I desire to offer myself as your
suitor."</p>

<p>She laughed at him without restraint or consideration.</p>

<p>"I would rather marry my brother's valet!" she declared.</p>

<p>"You are entirely wrong," he protested. "You are wrong, too,
in holding up cards against me. We are on the same side. You are
an American, and so am I. I swear that I desire nothing that is
not for your good. You have wonderful gifts, and I have great
wealth and opportunities. I have also a sincere and very
heartfelt admiration for you."</p>

<p>"I have never been more flattered!" Pamela scoffed.</p>

<p>He looked a little wistfully from one to the other.
Antagonism and dislike were written in their faces. Even Pamela,
who was skilled in the art of subterfuge, made little effort to
conceal her aversion. Nevertheless, he continued doggedly.</p>

<p>"What does it matter," he demanded, "who handles this
formula&mdash;you or I? Our faces are turned in the same
direction. There is this difference only with me. I want to make
it the basis of a kindlier feeling in Washington towards my
father's country."</p>

<p>Pamela's eyebrows were raised.</p>

<p>"Are you sure," she asked, "that the formula itself would not
find its way into your father's country?"</p>

<p>"As to that I pledge my word," he replied. "I am an American
citizen."</p>

<p>"Looks like it, doesn't he!" Van Teyl jeered.</p>

<p>"Tell us what you have been doing in Berlin, then?" Pamela
inquired.</p>

<p>"I had a definite mission there," Fischer assured them,
"which I hope to bring to a definite conclusion. If you are an
American citizen in the broadest sense of the word, England is
no more to you than Germany. I want to place before some
responsible person in the American Government, a
proposal&mdash;an official proposal&mdash;the acceptance of
which will be in years to come of immense benefit to her."</p>

<p>"And the quid pro quo?" Pamela asked gently.</p>

<p>"I am not here for the purpose of gratifying curiosity,"
Fischer replied, "but if you will take this matter up seriously,
you shall be the person through whom this proposal shall be
brought before the American Government. The whole of the
negotiations shall be conducted through you. If you succeed, you
will be known throughout history as the woman who saved America
from her great and growing danger. If you fail, you will be no
worse off than you are now."</p>

<p>"And you propose to hand over the conduct of these
negotiations to me," Pamela observed, "in return for what?"</p>

<p>"The pocketbook which you took from Captain Graham."</p>

<p>"So there we are, back again at the commencement of our
discussion," Pamela remarked. "Are you going to repeat that you
want this formula for Washington and not for Berlin?"</p>

<p>"My first idea," Fischer confessed, "was to hand it over to
Germany. I have changed my views. Germany has great explosives
of her own. This formula shall be used in a different fashion.
It shall be a lever in the coming negotiations between America
and Germany."</p>

<p>"We have had a great deal of conversation to no practical
purpose," Pamela declared. "Why are you so sure that I have the
formula?"</p>

<p>Fischer frowned slightly. He had recovered himself now, and
his tone was as steady and quiet as ever. Only occasionally his
eyes wandered to where James Van Teyl was fidgetting about the
table, and at such times his fingers tightened upon the stock of
his revolver.</p>

<p>"It is practically certain that you have the papers," he
pointed out. "You were the first person to go up the stairs
after Graham had been rendered unconscious. Joseph admits that
he had been forced to leave him&mdash;the orchestra was waiting
to play. He was alone in that little room. That you should have
known of its existence and his presence there is surprising, but
nothing more. Furthermore, I am convinced that you were in some
way concerned with his rescue later. You visited Hassan and you
visited Joseph. From the latter you procured the key of the
chapel. If only he had had the courage to tell the
truth&mdash;well, we will let that pass. You have the papers,
Miss Van Teyl. I am bidding a great price for them. If you are a
wise woman, you will not hesitate."</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door. They all three turned towards
it a little impatiently. Even Pamela and her brother felt the
grip of an absorbing problem. To their surprise, it was
Lutchester who reappeared upon the threshold. In his hand he
held a small sealed packet.</p>

<p>"So sorry to disturb you all," he apologised. "I have
something here which I believe belongs to you, Miss Van Teyl. I
thought I'd better bring it up and explain. From the way your
little Japanese friend was holding on to it, I thought it might
be important. It is a little torn, but that isn't my fault."</p>

<p>He held it out to Pamela. It was a long packet torn open at
one end. From it was protruding a worn, brown pocketbook.
Pamela's hand closed upon it mechanically. There was a dazed
look in her eyes. Fischer's fingers stole once more towards the
pocket into which, at Lutchester's entrance, he had slipped his
revolver.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="first">LUTCHESTER, to all appearance, remained
sublimely unconscious of the tension which his words and
appearance seemed to have created. He had strolled a little
further into the room, and was looking down at the packet which
he still held.</p>

<p>"You are wondering how I got hold of this, of course?" he
observed. "Just one of those simple little coincidences which
either mean a great deal or nothing at all."</p>

<p>"How did you know it was mine?" Pamela asked, almost under
her breath.</p>

<p>"I'll explain," Lutchester continued. "I was in the lobby of
the hotel, a few minutes ago, when I heard the fire bell
outside. I hurried out and watched the engines go by from the
sidewalk. I have always been rather interested in&mdash; "</p>

<p>"Never mind that, please. Go on," Pamela asked, almost under
her breath.</p>

<p>"Certainly," Lutchester assented. "On the way back, then, I
saw a little Japanese, who was coming out of the hotel, knocked
down by a taxicab which skidded nearly into the door. I don't
think he was badly hurt&mdash;I'm not even sure that he was hurt
at all. I picked up this packet from the spot where he had been
lying, and I was on the point of taking it to the office when I
saw your name upon it, Miss Van Teyl, in what seemed to me to be
your own handwriting, so I thought I'd bring it up."</p>

<p>He laid it upon the table. Pamela's eyes seemed fastened upon
it. She turned it over nervously.</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you, Mr. Lutchester," she murmured.</p>

<p>"I'll be perfectly frank," he went on. "I should have found
out where the little man who dropped it had disappeared to, and
restored it to him, but I fancied&mdash;of course, I may have
been wrong&mdash;that you and he were having some sort of a
disagreement, a few minutes ago, when I happened to come in.
Anyway, that was in my mind, and I thought I'd run no
risks."</p>

<p>"You did the very kindest and most considerate thing," Pamela
declared.</p>

<p>"The little Japanese must have been our new valet," James Van
Teyl observed. "I'm beginning to think that he is not going to
be much of an acquisition."</p>

<p>"You'll probably see something of him in a few minutes,"
Lutchester remarked. "I will wish you good night, Miss Van Teyl.
Good night!"</p>

<p>Pamela's reiterated thanks were murmured and perfunctory.
Even James Van Teyl's hospitable instincts seemed numbed. They
allowed Lutchester to depart with scarcely a word. With the
closing of the door, speech brought them some relief from a
state of tension which was becoming intolerable. Even then
Fischer at first said nothing. He had risen noiselessly to his
feet, his right hand was in the side-pocket of his coat, his eyes
were fixed upon the table.</p>

<p>"So this is why you insisted upon a valet!" James Van Teyl
exclaimed, his voice thick with anger. "He's planted here to rob
for you! Is that it, eh, Fischer?"</p>

<p>Pamela drew the packet towards her and stood with her right
palm covering it. Fischer seemed still at a loss for words.</p>

<p>"I can assure you," he said at last fervently, "that if that
packet was stolen from Miss Van Teyl by Nikasti, it was done
without my instigation. It is as much a surprise to me as to any
of you. We can congratulate ourselves that it is not on the way
to Japan."</p>

<p>Pamela nodded.</p>

<p>"He is speaking the truth," she asserted. "Nikasti is not out
to steal for others. He is playing the same game as all of us,
only he is playing it for his own hand. Mr. Fischer has brought
him here for some purpose of his own, without a doubt, but I am
quite sure that Nikasti never meant to be any one's
cat's-paw."</p>

<p>"Believe me, that is the truth," Fischer agreed. "I will
admit that I brought Nikasti here with a purpose, but upon my
honour I swear that until this evening I never dreamed that he
even knew of the existence of the formula."</p>

<p>"Oh! we are not the only people in the world who are clever,"
Pamela declared, with an unnatural little laugh. "The first man
who took note of Sandy Graham's silly words as he rushed into
Henry's was Baron Sunyea. I saw him stiffen as he listened. He
even uttered a word of remonstrance. Japan in London heard.
Japan in your sitting-room here, in ten days' time, knew
everything there was to be known."</p>

<p>"I didn't bring Nikasti here for this," Fischer insisted.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," Pamela conceded, "but if you're a good
American, what are you doing at all with a Japanese secret
agent?"</p>

<p>"If you trust me, you shall know," Fischer promised. "Listen
to reason. Let us have finished with one affair at a time. You
very nearly lost that formula to Japan. Hand over the
pocketbook. You see how dangerous it is for it to remain in your
possession. I'll keep my share of the bargain. I'll put my
scheme before you. Come, be reasonable. See, here's the forged
transfer."</p>

<p>He drew a paper from his pocket and spread it out upon the
table. His long, hairy fingers were shaking with
nervousness.</p>

<p>"Come, make it a deal," he persisted, "You can pay me the
defalcations or not, as you choose. There is your brother's
freedom and the honour of your name, in exchange for that
pocketbook."</p>

<p>Pamela, after all her hesitation, seemed to make up her mind
with startling suddenness. She thrust the pocketbook towards
Fischer, took the transfer from his fingers and tore it into
small pieces.</p>

<p>"I give in," she said. "This time you have scored. We will
talk about the other matter tomorrow."</p>

<p>Fischer buttoned up the packet carefully in his breast
pocket. His eyes glittered. He turned towards the door. On the
threshold he looked around. He stretched out his hand towards
Pamela.</p>

<p>"Believe me, you have done well," he assured her hoarsely. "I
shall keep my word. I will set you in the path of great
things."</p>

<p>He left the room, and they heard the furious ringing of the
lift bell. Pamela was tearing into smaller pieces the forged
transfer. Van Teyl, a little pale, but with new life in his
frame, was watching the fragments upon the floor. There was a
tap at the door. Nikasti entered. Pamela's fingers paused in
their task. Van Teyl stared at him. The newcomer was carrying
the evening papers, which he laid down upon the table.</p>

<p>"Is there anything more I can do before I go to bed, sir?" he
asked, with his usual reverential little bow.</p>

<p>"Aren't you hurt?" Van Teyl exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Hurt?" Nikasti replied wonderingly. "Oh, no!"</p>

<p>"Weren't you knocked down by a taxicab," Pamela asked,
"outside the hotel?"</p>

<p>Nikasti looked from one to the other with an air of gentle
surprise.</p>

<p>"I have been to my rooms in the servants' quarters," he told
them, "on the upper floor. I have not been downstairs at all. I
have been unpacking and arranging my own humble belongings."</p>

<p>Van Teyl clasped his forehead.</p>

<p>"Let me get this!" he exclaimed. "You haven't been down in
the lobby of the hotel, you haven't been knocked down by a
taxicab that skidded, you haven't lost a pocketbook which you
had previously stolen from my sister?"</p>

<p>Nikasti shook his head. He seemed completely mystified. He
watched Pamela's face carefully.</p>

<p>"Perhaps there has been some mistake," he suggested quietly.
"My English is sometimes not very good. I would not dream of
trying to rob the young lady. I have not lost any pocketbook. I
have not descended lower down in the hotel than this floor."</p>

<p>Van Teyl waved him away, accepted his farewell salutation,
and waited until the door was closed.</p>

<p>"Look here, Pamela," he protested, turning almost appealingly
towards her, "my brain wasn't made for this sort of thing. What
in thunder does it all mean?"</p>

<p>Pamela looked at the fragments of paper upon the floor and
sank back in an easy chair.</p>

<p>"Jimmy," she confided, "I don't know."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="first">PAMELA opened her eyes the next morning upon a
distinctly pleasing sight. At the foot of her bed was an
enormous basket of pink carnations. On the counterpane by her
side lay a smaller cluster of twelve very beautiful dark red
Gloire de Dijon roses. Attached to these latter was a note.</p>

<p>"When did these flowers come, Leah?" Pamela asked the maid
who was moving about the room.</p>

<p>"An hour ago, madam," the girl told her.</p>

<p>"Read the name on the card," Pamela directed, pointing to the
mass of pink blossoms.</p>

<p>"Mr. Oscar H. Fischer," the girl read out, "with respectful
compliments."</p>

<p>Pamela smiled.</p>

<p>"He doesn't know, then," she murmured to herself. "Get my
bath ready, Leah."</p>

<p>The maid disappeared into the inner room. Pamela tore open
the note attached to the roses by her side, and read it slowly
through:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Miss Van Teyl</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">I am so very sorry, but the luncheon we had
half-planned for to-day must be postponed. I have an urgent
message to go south; to inspect&mdash;but no secrets! It's
horribly disappointing. I hope we may meet in a few days.</p>

<p class="letter">Sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">John Lutchester</span>.</p>

<p><br>
Pamela laid down the note, conscious of an undefined but
distinct sensation of disappointment. After all, it was not so
wonderful to wake up and find oneself in New York. The sun was
pleasant, the little puffs of air which came in through the
window across the park, delightful and exhilarating, yet
something had gone out of the day. Accustomed to self-analysis,
she asked herself swiftly&mdash;what? It was, without a doubt,
something to do with Lutchester's departure. She tried to face
the question of her disappointment. Was it possible to feel any
real interest in a man who preferred a Government post to the
army at such a time, and who had brought his golf clubs out to
America? Her imagination for a moment revolved around the
problem of his apparently uninteresting and yet, in some
respects, contradictory personality. Was it really her fancy or
had she, every now and then, detected behind that flamboyant
manner traces of something deeper and more serious, something
which seemed to indicate a life and aims of which nothing
appeared upon the surface? She clasped her knees and sat up in
bed, listening to the sound of the running water in the next
room. Was there any possible explanation of his opportune
appearance on the night before with a dummy pocketbook and a
concocted story? The cleverest man on earth could surely never
have gauged her position with Fischer and intervened in such a
manner at the psychological moment.</p>

<p>Yet he had done it, she reflected, gazing thoughtfully at
Fischer's gift. If, indeed, he knew what was passing around him
to that extent, how much more knowledge might he not possess?
She felt the little silken belt around her waist. At least there
was no one who could take Sandy Graham's secret from her until
she chose to give it up. Supposing for a moment that Lutchester
was also out for the great things, was he fooled by her
attitude? If he knew so much, he must know that the secret
remained with her. Perhaps, after all, he was only a philanderer
in intrigue....</p>

<p>Pamela bathed and dressed, sent for her brother, and, to his
horror, insisted upon an American breakfast.</p>

<p>"It's quite time I came back to look after you, Jimmy," she
said severely, as she watched him send away his grapefruit and
gaze helplessly at his bacon and eggs. "You're going to turn
over a new leaf, young man."</p>

<p>"I shan't be sorry," he confessed fervently. "I tell you,
Pamela, when you have a thing like this hanging over you, it's
hell&mdash;some hell! You just want to drown your thoughts and
keep going all the time."</p>

<p>She nodded sagely.</p>

<p>"Well, that's over now, Jimmy," she said, "and I meant you to
listen to me. It's more than likely that Mr. Fischer may find
out at any moment that the mysterious pocketbook, which came
from heaven knows where, is a faked one. He may be horrid about
it."</p>

<p>"While we are on that," Van Teyl interrupted, "I couldn't
sleep a wink last night for trying to imagine where on earth
that fellow Lutchester came in, and what his game was."</p>

<p>"I have a headache this morning, trying to puzzle out the
same thing," Pamela told him.</p>

<p>"He seems such an ordinary sort of chap," Van Teyl continued
thoughtfully. "Good sportsman, no doubt, and all that sort of
thing, but the last fellow in the world to concoct a yarn, and
if he did, what was his object?"</p>

<p>"Jimmy," his sister begged, "let's quit. Of course, I know a
little more than you do, but the little more that I do know only
makes it more confusing. Now, to make it worse, he's gone
away."</p>

<p>"What, this morning?"</p>

<p>"Gone away on his Government work," Pamela announced. "I had
a note and some roses from him. Don't let's talk about it,
Jimmy. I keep on getting new ideas, and it makes my brain whirl.
I want to talk about you."</p>

<p>"I'm a rotten lot to talk about," he sighed.</p>

<p>She patted his hand.</p>

<p>"You're nothing of the sort, dear, and you've got to remember
now that you're out of the trouble. But listen. Hurry down to
the office as early as you can and set about straightening
things out, so that if Mr. Fischer tries to make trouble, he
won't be able to do it. There's my cheque for eighty-nine
thousand dollars I made out last night before I went to bed,"
she added, passing it over to him. "Just replace what stocks
you're short of and get yourself out of the mess, and don't
waste any time about it."</p>

<p>His face glowed as he looked across the table.</p>

<p>"You're the most wonderful sister, Pamela."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" she interrupted. "Nonsense! I ought not to have
left you alone all this time, and, besides, I'm pretty sure he
helped you into this trouble for his own ends. Anyway, we are
all right now. I shall be in New York for a few days before I go
to Washington. When I do go, you must see whether you can get
leave and come with me."</p>

<p>"That's bully," he declared. "I'll get leave, right enough.
There's never been less doing in Wall Street. But say, Pamela, I
don't seem to half understand what's going on. You've given up
most of your friends, and you spend months away there in Europe
in all sorts of corners. Now you come back and you seem mixed up
in regular secret service work. Where do you come in, anyway?
What are you going to Washington for?"</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"Queer tastes, haven't I, Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"Queer for a girl."</p>

<p>"That's prejudice," she objected, shaking her head. "Nowadays
there are few things a woman can't do. To tell you the truth, my
new interest in life started three years ago, when Uncle
Theodore found out that I was going to Rome for the winter."</p>

<p>"So Uncle Theodore started it, did he?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"That's the worst of having an uncle in the Administration,
isn't it? Well, of course, he gave me letters to every one in
Rome, and I found out what he wanted quite easily, and without
the inquiries going through the Embassy at all. Sometimes, as
you can understand, that's a great advantage. I found it simply
fascinating&mdash;the work, I mean&mdash;and after three or four
more commissions&mdash;well, they recognised me at Washington. I
have been to most of the capitals in Europe at different times,
with small affairs to arrange at each, or information to get.
Sometimes it's been just about commercial things. Since the war,
though, of course, it's been more exciting than ever. If I were
an Englishwoman instead of an American, I could tell them some
things in London which they'd find pretty surprising. It's not
my affair, though, and I keep what information I do pick up
until it works in with something else for our own good. I knew
quite well in Berlin, for instance, to speak of something you've
heard of, that Henry's Restaurant in London was being used as a
centre of espionage by the Germans. That is why I was on the
lookout, the day I went there."</p>

<p>"You mean the day that pocketbook was stolen that the whole
world seems crazy about?" Van Teyl asked.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"I believe it is perfectly true," she said, "that a young man
called Graham has invented an entirely new explosive, the
formula for which he brought to Henry's with him that day. It
isn't only what happens when the shell explodes, but a sort of
putrefaction sets in all round, and they say that everything
within a mile dies. There were spies down even watching his
experiments. There were spies following him up to London, there
were spies in Henry's Restaurant when like a fool he gave the
thing away. Fischer was the ringleader of this lot, and he meant
having the formula from Graham that night. I don't want to bore
you, Jimmy, but I got there first."</p>

<p>"Bore me!" the young man repeated. "Why, it's like a modern
Arabian Nights. I can't imagine you in the thick of this sort of
thing, Pamela."</p>

<p>"It's very easy to slip into the way of anything you like,"
she answered. "I knew exactly what they were going to do to
Captain Graham, and I got there before them. When they searched
him, the formula had gone. Fischer caught my steamer and worried
me all the way over. He thought he had us in a corner last
night, and then a miracle happened."</p>

<p>"You mean that fellow Lutchester turning up?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I mean that," Pamela admitted.</p>

<p>"Say, didn't that Jap fellow get the pocketbook from your
rooms at all, then?" Van Teyl asked. "I couldn't follow it all
last night."</p>

<p>"He searched my rooms," Pamela replied, "and failed to find
it. Afterwards, when he and I were alone in your sitting-room,
heaven knows what would have happened, but for the miraculous
arrival of Mr. Lutchester, whom I had left behind in London,
come to pay an evening call in the Hotel Plaza, New York!"</p>

<p>Van Teyl shook his head slowly, got up from his seat, lit a
cigarette, and came back again.</p>

<p>"Pam," he confessed, "my brain won't stand it. You're not
going to tell me that Lutchester's in the game? Why, a simpler
sort of fellow I never spoke to."</p>

<p>"I can't make up my own mind about Mr. Lutchester," Pamela
sighed. "He helped me in London on the night I sailed&mdash;in
fact, he was very useful indeed&mdash; but why he invented that
story about Nikasti, brought a dummy pocketbook into the room
and helped us out of all our troubles, unless it was by sheer
and brilliant instinct, I cannot imagine."</p>

<p class="caption">"I can't make up my own mind about Mr. Lutchester," Pamela sighed.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>"Let me get on to this," Van Teyl said. "Even the pocketbook
was a fake, then?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be likely to leave things I risk my life for
about my bedroom," she told him.</p>

<p>"Where is it, then&mdash;the real thing?" he asked.</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"If you must know, Jimmy," she confided, dropping her voice,
"it's in a little compartment of a silk belt around my waist. It
will remain there until I get to Washington, or until Mr.
Haskall comes to me."</p>

<p>"Haskall, the Government explosives man?"</p>

<p>Pamela nodded.</p>

<p>"Even he won't get it without Government authority."</p>

<p>"Now, tell me, Pamela," Van Teyl went on&mdash;"you're a
far-seeing girl&mdash;I suppose we should get it in the neck from
Germany some day or other, if the Germans won? Why don't you
hand the formula over to the British, and give them a chance to
get ahead?"</p>

<p>"That's a sensible question, Jimmy, and I'll try to answer
it," Pamela promised. "Because when once the shells are made and
used, the secret will be gone. I think it very likely that it
would enable England to win the war; but, you see, I am an
American, not English, and I'm all American. I have been in
touch with things pretty closely for some time now, and I see
trouble ahead for us before very long. I can't exactly tell you
where it's coming from, but I feel it. I want America to have
something up her sleeve, that's why."</p>

<p>"You're a great girl, Pamela," her brother declared. "I'm off
downtown, feeling a different man. And, Pamela, I haven't said
much, but God bless you, and as long as I live I'm going as
straight as a die. I've had my lesson."</p>

<p>He bent over her a little clumsily and kissed her. Pamela
walked to the door with him.</p>

<p>"Be a dear," she called out, "and come back early. And,
Jimmy!" ...</p>

<p>"Hullo?'"</p>

<p>"Put things right at the office at once," she whispered with
emphasis. "Fischer hasn't found out yet. I sent him a message
this morning, thanking him for the carnations, and asking him to
walk with me in the park after breakfast, I shall keep him away
till lunch time, at least."</p>

<p>The young man looked at her, and at Nikasti, who out in the
corridor was holding his hat and cane. Then he chuckled.</p>

<p>"And they say that things don't happen in New York!" he
murmured, as he turned away.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="first">AN elderly New Yorker, a man of fashion,
renowned for his social perceptions, pressed his companion's arm
at the entrance to Central Park and pointed to Pamela.</p>

<p>"There goes a typical New York girl," he said, "and the
best-looking I've seen for many a long day. You can go all round
Europe, Freddie, and not see a girl with a face and figure like
that. She had that frank way, too, of looking you in the
eyes."</p>

<p>"I know," the other assented. "Gibson's girls all had it.
Kind of look which seems to say&mdash;'I know you find me nice
and I don't mind. I wonder whether you're nice, too.'"</p>

<p>Pamela strolled along the park with Fischer by her side. She
wore a tailor-made costume of black and white tweed, and a smart
hat, in which yellow seemed the predominating colour. Her shoes,
her gloves, the little tie about her throat, were all the last
word in the simple elegance of suitability. Fischer walked by
her side&mdash;a powerful, determined figure in a carefully-pressed blue serge suit and a brown Homburg hat. He wore a rose
in his buttonhole, and he carried a cane&mdash;both unusual
circumstances. After fifty years of strenuous living, Mr.
Fischer seemed suddenly to have found a new thing in the
world.</p>

<p>"This is a pleasant idea of yours, Miss Van Teyl," he
said.</p>

<p>"I haven't disturbed your morning, I hope?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I guess, if you have, it isn't the way you mean," he
replied. "You've disturbed a good deal of my time and thoughts
lately."</p>

<p>"Well, you've had your own way now," she sighed, looking at
him out of the corner of her eyes. "I suppose you always get
your own way in the end, don't you, Mr. Fischer?"</p>

<p>"Generally," he admitted. "I tell you, though, Miss Van
Teyl," he went on earnestly, "if you're alluding to last night's
affair, I hated the whole business. It was my duty, and the
opportunity was there, but with what I have I am satisfied. With
reference to that little debt of your brother's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please don't say a word, Mr. Fischer," she interrupted. "You
will find that all put right as soon as you get down to Wall
Street. Tell me, what have you done with your prize?"</p>

<p>Mr. Fischer looked very humble.</p>

<p>"Miss Van Teyl," he said, "for certain reasons I am going to
tell you the truth. Perhaps it will be the best in the long run.
We may even before long be working together. So I start by being
honest with you. The pocketbook is by now on its way to
Germany."</p>

<p>"To Germany?" she exclaimed. "And after all your
promises!"</p>

<p>"Ah, but think, Miss Van Teyl," he pleaded. "I throw aside
all subterfuge. In your heart you know well what I am and what I
stand for. I deny it no longer. I am a German-American, working
for Germany, simply because America does not need my help. If
America were at war with any country in the world, my brains, my
knowledge, my wealth would be hers. But now it is different.
Germany is surrounded by many enemies, and she calls for her
sons all over the world to remember the Fatherland. You can
sympathise a little with my unfortunate country, Miss Van Teyl,
and yet remain a good American. You are not angry with me?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I ought to be, but I am not in the least," she
assured him. "I never had any doubt as to the destination of
that packet."</p>

<p>"That," he admitted, "is a relief to me. Let us wipe the
matter from our memories, Miss Van Teyl."</p>

<p>"One word," she begged, "and that only of curiosity. Did you
examine the contents of the pocketbook?"</p>

<p>He turned his head and looked at her. For a moment he had
lost the greater spontaneity of his new self. He was again the
cold, calculating machine.</p>

<p>"No," he answered, "except to take out and destroy what
seemed to be a few private memoranda. There was a bill for
flowers, a note from a young lady&mdash;some rubbish of that
sort. The remaining papers were all calculations and figures,
chemical formulae."</p>

<p>"Are you a chemist, Mr. Fischer?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," he acknowledged. "I recognised just
enough of the formulae on the last page to realise that there
were entirely new elements being dealt with."</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"I only asked out of curiosity. I agree. Let us put it out of
our thoughts. You see, I am generous. We have fought a battle,
you and I, and I have lost. Yet we remain friends."</p>

<p>"It is more than your friendship that I want, Miss Van Teyl,"
he pleaded, his voice shaking a little. "I am years older than
you, I know, and, by your standards, I fear unattractive. But
you love power, and I have it. I will take you into my schemes.
I will show you how those live who stand behind the clouds and
wield the thunders."</p>

<p>She looked at him with genuine surprise. It was necessary to
readjust some of her impressions of him. Oscar Fischer was,
after all, a human being.</p>

<p>"What you say is all very well so far as it goes," she told
him. "I admit that a life of scheming and adventure attracts me.
I love power. I can think of nothing more wonderful than to feel
the machinery of the world&mdash;the political world&mdash;roar
or die away, according to the touch of one's fingers. Oh, yes,
we're alike so far as that is concerned! But there is a very
vital difference. You are only an American by accident. I am one
by descent. For me there doesn't exist any other country. For
you Germany comes first."</p>

<p>"But can't you realise," he went on eagerly, "that even this
is for the best? America to-day is hypnotised by a maudlin,
sentimental affection for England, a country from whom she never
received anything but harm. We want to change that. We want to
kill for ever the misunderstandings between the two greatest
nations in the world. My creed of life could be yours, too,
without a single lapse from your patriotism. Friendship,
alliance, brotherhood, between Germany and America. That would
be my text."</p>

<p>"Shall I be perfectly frank?" Pamela asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing else is worth while," was the instant answer.</p>

<p>"Well, then," she continued, "I can quite see that Germany
has everything to gain from America's friendship, but I cannot
see the quid pro quo."</p>

<p>"And yet it is so clear," Fischer insisted. "Your own cloud
may not be very large just now, but it is growing, and, before
you know it, it will be upon you. Can you not realise why Japan
is keeping out of this war? She is conserving her strength.
Millions flow into her coffers week by week. In a few years
time, Japan, for the first time in her history, will know what
it is to possess solid wealth. What does she want it for, do you
think? She has no dreams of European aggression, or her soldiers
would be fighting there now. China is hers for the taking, a
rich prize ready to fall into her mouth at any moment. But the
end and aim of all Japanese policy, the secret Mecca of her
desires, is to repay with the sword the insults your country has
heaped upon her. It is for that, believe me, that her arsenals
are working night and day, her soldiers are training, her fleet
is in reserve. While you haggle about a few volunteers, Japan is
strengthening and perfecting a mighty army for one purpose and
one purpose only. Unless you wake up, you will be in the
position that Great Britain was in two years ago. Even now, work
though you may, you will never wholly make up for lost time. The
one chance for you is friendship with Germany."</p>

<p>"Will Germany be in a position to help us after the war?"
Pamela asked.</p>

<p>"Never doubt it," Fischer replied vehemently. "Before peace
is signed the sea power of England will be broken. Financially
she will be ruined. She is a country without economic science,
without foresight, without statesmen. The days of her golden
opportunities have passed, frittered away. Unless we of our
great pity bind up her wounds, England will bleed to death
before the war is over."</p>

<p>"That, you must remember," Pamela said practically, "is your
point of view."</p>

<p>"I could tell you things&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Don't," she begged. "I know what your outlook is now. Be
definite. Leaving aside that other matter, what is your
proposition to me?"</p>

<p>Fischer walked for a while in silence. They had turned back
some time since, and were once more nearing the Plaza.</p>

<p>"You ask me to leave out what is most vital," he said at
last. "I have never been married, Miss Van Teyl. I am wealthy. I
am promised great honours at the end of this war. When that
comes, I shall rest. If you will be my wife, you can choose your
home, you can choose your title."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"But I am not sure that I even like you, Mr. Fischer," she
objected. "We have fought in opposite camps, and you have had
the bad taste to be victorious. Besides which, you were
perfectly brutal to James, and I am not at all sure that I don't
resent your bargain with me. As a matter of fact, I am feeling
very bitter towards you."</p>

<p>"You should not," he remonstrated earnestly. "Remember that,
after all, women are only dabblers in diplomacy. Their very
physique prevents them from playing the final game. You have
brains, of course, but there are other things&mdash; experience,
courage, resource. You would be a wonderful helpmate, Miss Van
Teyl, even if your individual and unaided efforts have not been
entirely successful."</p>

<p>She sighed. Pamela just then was a picture of engaging
humility.</p>

<p>"It is so hard for me," she murmured, "I do not want to marry
yet. I do not wish to think of it. And so far as you are
concerned, Mr. Fischer&mdash;well, I am simply furious when I
think of your attitude last night. But I love adventures."</p>

<p>"I will promise you all the adventures that can be crammed
into your life," he urged.</p>

<p>"But be more definite," she persisted. "Where should we
start? You are over here now on some important mission. Tell me
more about it?"</p>

<p>"I cannot just yet," he answered. "All that I can promise you
is that, if I am successful, it will stop the war just as surely
as Captain Graham's new explosive."</p>

<p>"I thought you were going to make a confidante of me," she
complained.</p>

<p>He suddenly gripped her arm. It was the first time he had
touched her, and she felt a queer surging of the blood to her
head, a sudden and almost uncontrollable repulsion. The touch of
his long fingers was like flame; his eyes, behind their
sheltering spectacles, glowed in a curious, disconcerting
fashion.</p>

<p>"To the woman who was my pledged wife," he said, "I would
tell everything. From the woman who gave me her hand and became
my ally I would have no secrets. Come, I have a message, more
than a message, to the American people. I am taking it to
Washington before many hours have passed. If it is your will, it
should be you to whom I will deliver it."</p>

<p>Pamela walked on with her head in the air. Fischer was
leaning a little towards her. Every now and then his mouth
twitched slightly. His eyes seemed to be seeking to reach the
back of her brain.</p>

<p>"Please go now," she begged. "I can't think clearly while you
are here, and I want to make up my mind. I will send to you when
I am ready."</p>

<h2><a id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="first">PAMELA sat that afternoon on the balcony of the
country club at Baltusrol and approved of her surroundings.
Below her stretched a pleasant vista of rolling greensward,
dotted here and there with the figures of the golfers. Beyond,
the misty blue background of rising hills.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you how peaceful this all seems, Jimmy," she
said to her brother, who had brought her out in his automobile.
"One doesn't notice the air of strain over on the Continent,
because it's the same everywhere, but it gets a little on one's
nerves, all the same. I positively love it here."</p>

<p>"It's fine to have you," was the hearty response. "Gee, that
fellow coming to the sixteenth hole can play some!"</p>

<p>Pamela directed her attention idly towards the figure which
her brother indicated&mdash;a man in light tweeds, who played
with an easy and graceful swing, and with the air of one to whom
the game presented no difficulties whatever. She watched him
drive for the seventeenth&mdash;a long, raking ball, fully fifty
yards further than his opponent's&mdash;watched him play a
perfect mashie shot to the green and hole out in three.</p>

<p>"A birdie," James Van Teyl murmured. "I say, Pamela!"</p>

<p>She took no notice. Her eyes were still following the figure
of the golfer. She watched him drive at the last hole, play a
chip shot on to the green, and hit the hole for a three. The
frown deepened upon her forehead. She was looking very
uncompromising when John Luchester ascended the steps.</p>

<br>

The frown deepened upon her forehead. She was looking<br>
very uncompromising when John Luchester ascended the steps.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>"I didn't know, Mr. Lutchester, that there were any factories
down this way," she remarked severely, as he paused before her
in surprise.</p>

<p>For a single moment she fancied that she saw a flash of
annoyance in his eyes. It was gone so swiftly, however, that she
remained uncertain. He held out his hand, laughing.</p>

<p>"Fairly caught out, Miss Van Teyl," he confessed. "You see, I
was tempted, and I fell."</p>

<p>His companion, an elderly, clean-shaven man, passed on.
Pamela glanced after him.</p>

<p>"Who is your opponent?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Just some one I picked up on the tee," Lutchester explained.
"How is our friend Fischer this morning?"</p>

<p>"I walked with him for an hour in the Park," Pamela replied.
"He seemed quite cheerful. I have scarcely thanked you yet for
returning the pocketbook, have I?"</p>

<p>His face was inscrutable.</p>

<p>"Couldn't keep a thing that didn't belong to me, could I?" he
observed.</p>

<p>"You have a marvellous gift for discovering lost property,"
she murmured.</p>

<p>"For discovering the owners, you mean," he retorted, with a
little bow.</p>

<p>"You're some golfer, I see, Mr. Lutchester," Van Teyl
interposed.</p>

<p>"I was on my game to-day," Lutchester admitted. "With a
little luck at the seventh," he continued earnestly, "I might
have tied the amateur record. You see, my ball&mdash;but there,
I mustn't bore you now. I must look after my opponent and stand
him a drink. We shall meet again, I daresay."</p>

<p>Lutchester passed on, and Pamela glanced up at her
brother.</p>

<p>"Is he a sphinx or a fool?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me," Van Teyl replied. "Seems to me you were a bit
rough on him, anyway. I don't see why the fellow shouldn't have
a day's holiday before he gets to work. If I had his swing, it
would interfere with my career, I know that, well enough."</p>

<p>"Did you recognise the man with whom he was playing?" Pamela
inquired.</p>

<p>"Can't say that I did. His face seems familiar, too."</p>

<p>"Go and see if you can find out his name," Pamela begged. "It
isn't ordinary curiosity. I really want to know."</p>

<p>"That's easy enough," Van Teyl replied, rising from his
place. "And I'll order tea at the same time."</p>

<p>Pamela leaned a little further back in her chair. Her eyes
seemed to be fixed upon the pleasant prospect of wooded slopes
and green, upward-stretching sward. As a matter of fact, she saw
only two faces&mdash; Fischer's and Lutchester's. Her chief
impulse in life for the immediate present seemed to have
resolved itself into a fierce, almost a passionate curiosity. It
was the riddle of those two brains which she was so anxious to
solve. ... Fischer, the cold, subtle intriguer, with schemes at
the back of his mind which she knew quite well that, even in the
moment of his weakness, he intended to keep to himself; and
Lutchester, with his almost cynical devotion to pleasure, yet
with his unaccountable habit of suggesting a strength and
qualities to which he neither laid nor established any claim. Of
the two men it was Lutchester who piqued her, with whom she
would have found more pleasure in the battle of wits. She found
herself alternately furious and puzzled with him, yet her
uneasiness concerning him possessed more disquieting, more
fascinating possibilities than any of the emotions inspired by
the other man.</p>

<p>Van Teyl returned to her presently, a little impressed.</p>

<p>"Thought I knew that chap's face," he observed. "It's Eli
Hamblin&mdash;Senator Hamblin, you know."</p>

<p>"A friend and confidant of the President," she murmured. "A
Westerner, too. I wonder what he's doing here ... Jimmy!"</p>

<p>"Hallo, Sis?"</p>

<p>"You've just got to be a dear," Pamela begged. "Go to the
caddy master, or professional, or some one, and find out whether
Mr. Lutchester met him here by accident or whether they arrived
together."</p>

<p>"You'll turn me into a regular sleuthhound," he laughed.
"However, here goes."</p>

<p>He strolled off again, and Pamela found herself forced to
become mundane and frivolous whilst she chatted with some
newly-arrived acquaintances. It was not until some little time after her brother's return that she found herself alone with him.</p>

<p>"Well?" she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"They arrived within a few minutes of one another," Van Teyl
announced. "Senator Hamblin bought a couple of new balls and
made some inquiries about the course, but said nothing about
playing. Lutchester, who appears not to have known him, came up
later and asked him if he'd like a game. That's all I could find
out."</p>

<p>Pamela pointed to a little cloud of dust in the distance.</p>

<p>"And there they go," she observed, "together."</p>

<p>Van Teyl threw himself into a chair and accepted the cup of
tea which his sister handed him.</p>

<p>"Well," he inquired, "what do you make of it?"</p>

<p>"There's more in that question than you think, James," Pamela
replied. "All the same, I think I shall be able to answer it in
a few days."</p>

<p>Another little crowd of acquaintances discovered them, and
Pamela was soon surrounded by a fresh group of admirers. They
all went out presently to inspect the new tennis courts. Pamela
and her brother were beset with invitations.</p>

<p>"You positively must stay down and dine with us, and go home
by moonlight," Mrs. Saunders, a lively young matron with a large
country house close by, insisted. "Jimmy's neglected me terribly
these last few months, and as for you, Pamela, I haven't seen
you for a year."</p>

<p>"I'd love to if we can," Pamela assured her, "but Jimmy will
have to telephone first."</p>

<p>"Then do be quick about it," Mrs. Saunders begged, "It
doesn't matter a bit about clothes. We've twenty people staying
in the house now, and half of us won't change, if that makes you
more comfortable. Jimmy, if you fail at that telephone I'll
never forgive you."</p>

<p>But Van Teyl, who had caught the little motion of his
sister's head towards the city, proved equal to the occasion. He
returned presently, driving the car.</p>

<p>"Got to go," he announced as he made his farewells. "Can't be
helped, Pamela. Frightfully sorry, Mrs. Saunders, we are wanted
up in New York."</p>

<p>Pamela sighed.</p>

<p>"I was so afraid of it," she regretted as she waved her
adieux. . . . .</p>

<p>An hour or so later the city broke before them in murky
waves. Pamela, who had been leaning back in the car, deep in
thought, sat up.</p>

<p>"You are a perfect dear, James," she said. "Do you think you
could stand having Mr. Fischer to dinner one evening this
week?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" he replied, a little curiously. "If you want to keep
friends with him for any reason, I don't bear him any
ill-will."</p>

<p>"I just want to talk to him," Pamela murmured, "that's
all."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was a ripple of interest and a good deal
of curiosity that afternoon, in the lounge and entrance hall of
the Hotel Plaza, when a tall, grey moustached gentleman of
military bearing descended from the automobile which had brought
him from the station, and handed in his name at the desk,
inquiring for Mr. Fischer.</p>

<p>"Will you send my name up&mdash;the Baron von Schwerin," he
directed.</p>

<p>The clerk, who had recognised the newcomer, took him under
his personal care.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fischer is up in his rooms, expecting you, Baron," he
announced. "If you'll come this way, I'll take you up."</p>

<p>The Baron followed his guide to the lift and along the
corridor to the suite of rooms occupied by Mr. Fischer and his
young friend, James Van Teyl. Mr. Fischer himself opened the
door. The two men clasped hands cordially, and the clerk
discreetly withdrew.</p>

<p>"Back with us once more, Fischer," Von Schwerin exclaimed
fervently. "You are wonderful. Tell me," he added, looking
around, "we are to be alone here?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely," Fischer replied. "The young man I share these
apartments with&mdash;James Van Teyl&mdash;has taken his sister
out to Baltusrol. They will not be back until seven o'clock. We
are sure of solitude."</p>

<p>"Good!" Von Schwerin exclaimed. "And you have news&mdash;I
can see it in your face."</p>

<p>Fischer rolled up easy chairs and produced a box of
cigars.</p>

<p>"Yes," he assented, with a little glitter in his eyes, "I
have news. Things have moved with me. I think that, with the
help of an idiotic Englishman, we shall solve the riddle of what
our professors have called the consuming explosive. I sent the
formula home to Germany, by a trusty hand, only a few hours
ago."</p>

<p>"Capital!" Von Schwerin declared. "It was arranged in London,
that?"</p>

<p>"Partly in London and partly here," Fischer replied.</p>

<p>Von Schwerin made a grimace.</p>

<p>"If you can find those who are willing to help you here, you
are fortunate indeed," he sighed. "My life's work has lain
amongst these people. In the days of peace, all seemed
favourable to us. Since the war, even those people whom I
thought my friends seem to have lost their heads, to have lost
their reasoning powers."</p>

<p>"After all," Fischer muttered, "it is race calling to race.
But come, we have more direct business on hand. Nikasti is
here."</p>

<p>Von Schwerin nodded a little gloomily.</p>

<p>"Washington knows nothing of his coming," he observed. "I
attended the Baron Yung's reception last week, informally. I
threw out very broad hints, but Yung would not be drawn. Nikasti
represents the Secret Service of Japan, unofficially and without
responsibility."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," Fischer pointed out, "what he says will reach
the ear of his country, and reach it quickly. You've gone
through the papers I sent you?"</p>

<p>"Carefully," Von Schwerin replied. "And the autograph
letter?"</p>

<p>"That I have," Fischer announced. "I will fetch Nikasti."</p>

<p>He crossed the room and opened the door leading into the
bedchambers.</p>

<p>"Are you there, Kato?" he cried.</p>

<p>"I am coming, sir," was the instant reply.</p>

<p>Nikasti appeared, a few moments later. He was carrying a
dress coat on his arm, and he held a clothes brush in his hand.
It was obvious that he had studied with nice care the details of
his new part.</p>

<p>"You can sit down, Nikasti," Fischer invited. "This is the
Baron von Schwerin. He has something to say to you."</p>

<p>Nikasti bowed very low. He declined the chair, however, to
which Fischer pointed.</p>

<p>"I am your valet and the valet of Mr. Van Teyl," he murmured.
"It is not fitting for me to be seated. I listen."</p>

<p>Von Schwerin drew his chair a little nearer.</p>

<p>"I plunge at once," he said, "into the middle of things.
There is always the fear that we may be disturbed."</p>

<p>Nikasti inclined his head.</p>

<p>"It is best," he agreed.</p>

<p>"You are aware," Von Schwerin continued, "that the Imperial
Government of Germany has already made formal overtures, through
a third party, to the Emperor of Japan with reference to an
alteration in our relations?"</p>

<p>"There was talk of this in Tokio," Nikasti observed softly.
"Japan, however, is under obligations&mdash;treaty obligations.
Her honour demands that these should be kept."</p>

<p>"The honour of a country," Baron von Schwerin acknowledged,
"is, without doubt, a sacred charge upon her rulers, but above
all things in heaven or on earth, the interests of her people
must be their first consideration. If a time should come when
the two might seem to clash, then it is the task of the
statesman to recognise this fact."</p>

<p>Nikasti bowed.</p>

<p>"It is spoken," he confessed, "like a great man."</p>

<p>"Your country," Von Schwerin continued, "is at war with mine
because it seemed to her rulers that her interests lay with the
Allies rather than with Germany. I will admit that my country
was at fault. We did not recognise to its full extent the value
of friendship with Japan. We did not bid high enough for your
favours. Asia concerned us very little. We looked upon the
destruction of our interests there in the same spirit as that
with which we contemplated the loss of our colonies. All that
might happen would be temporary. Our influence in Asia, our
colonies, will remain with us or perish, according to the result
of the war in Europe. But our statesmen overlooked one
thing."</p>

<p>"Our factories," Nikasti murmured.</p>

<p>"Precisely! We have had our agents all over the world for
years. Some are good, a few are easily deceived. There is no
country in the world where apparently so much liberty is granted
to foreigners as in Japan. There is no country where the
capacity for manufacture and output has been so grossly
underestimated by our agents, as yours."</p>

<p>Nikasti smiled.</p>

<p>"I had something to do with that," he announced. "It was Karl
Neumann, was it not, on whom you relied? I supplied him with
much information."</p>

<p>Von Schwerin's face clouded for a moment.</p>

<p>"You mean that you fooled him, I suppose," he said. "Well, it
is all part of the game. That is over now. We want your exports
to Russia stopped."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Nikasti murmured reflectively. "Stopped!"</p>

<p>"We ask no favours," Von Schwerin continued. "The issue of
the war is written across the face of the skies for those who
care to read."</p>

<p>Nikasti looked downwards at the dress coat which he was
carrying. Then he glanced up at Von Schwerin.</p>

<p>"Perhaps our eyes have been dazzled," he said. "Will you not
interpret?"</p>

<p>"The end of the war will be a peace of exhaustion," Von
Schwerin explained. "Our loftier dreams of conquest we must
abandon. Germany has played her part, but Austria, alas! has
failed. Peace will leave us all very much where we were. Very
well, then, I ask you, what has Japan gained? You answer China?
I deny it. Yet even if it were true, it will take you five
hundred years to make a great country of China. Suppose for a
moment you had been on the other side. What about Australia?...
New Zealand?"</p>

<p>"Are those things under present consideration?" Nikasti
queried.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Von Schwerin replied. "Listen. Close your exports
to Russia within the next thirty days. Build up for yourselves a
stock of ammunition, add to your fleet, and prepare. Within a
year of the cessation of war, there is no reason why your
national dream should not be realised. Your fleet may sail for
San Francisco. The German fleet shall make a simultaneous attack
upon the eastern coast of Massachusetts and New York."</p>

<p>"The German fleet," Nikasti repeated. "And England?"</p>

<p>Von Schwerin's eyes flashed for a moment.</p>

<p>"If the English fleet is still in being," he declared, "it
will be a crippled and defeated fleet, but, for the sake of your
point of view, I will assume that it exists. Even then there
will be nothing to prevent the German fleet from steaming in
what waters it pleases. If our shells fall upon New York on the
day when your warships are sighted off the Californian coast, do
you suppose that America could resist? With her seaboard, her
fleet is contemptible. For her wealth, her army is a farce. She
has neglected for a great many years to pay her national
insurance. She is the one country in the world who can be bled
for the price of empires."</p>

<p>Fischer, who had been smoking furiously, spat out the end of
a fresh cigar.</p>

<p>"It will be a just retribution," he interposed, with
smothered fierceness. "Under the guise of neutrality, America
has been responsible for the lives of hundreds of thousands of
my countrymen. That we never can, we never shall, forget. The
wealth which makes these people fat is blood-money, and Germany
will take her vengeance."</p>

<p>"For whom do you speak?" Nikasti inquired.</p>

<p>Von Schwerin rose from his place.</p>

<p>"For the greatest of all."</p>

<p>"Do I take anything but words to Tokio?" the Japanese asked
softly.</p>

<p>Fischer unfolded a pocketbook and drew from it a parchment
envelope.</p>

<p>"You take this letter," he said, "which I brought over myself
from Berlin, signed and written not more than three weeks ago. I
ask you to believe in no vague promises. I bring you the pledged
faith of the greatest ruler on earth. What do you say, Nikasti?
Will you accept our mission? Will you go back to Tokio and see
the Emperor?"</p>

<p>Nikasti bowed.</p>

<p>"I will go back," he promised. "I will sail as soon as I can
make arrangements. But I cannot tell you what the issue may be.
We Japanese are not a self-seeking nation. Above and higher than
all things are our ideals and our honour. I cannot tell what
answer our Sovereign may give to this."</p>

<p>"These are the days when the truest patriotism demands the
most sublime sacrifices," Von Schwerin declared. "Above all the
ethics of individuals comes the supreme necessity of
self-preservation."</p>

<p>The Japanese smiled slightly.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, "there speaks the philosophy of your country,
Baron, the paean of materialism."</p>

<p>"The destinies of nations," Baron von Schwerin exclaimed,
"are above the man-made laws of a sentimental religion! One
needs, nowadays, more than to survive. It is necessary to
flourish."</p>

<p>Nikasti stood suddenly to attention.</p>

<p>"It is Mr. Van Teyl who returns," he warned them.</p>

<p>He glided from the room, shaking out a little the dress coat
which he had been carrying. The two men looked after him.
Fischer threw his cigar savagely away and lit another.</p>

<p>"Curse these orientals!" he muttered. "They listen and
listen, and one never knows. Van Teyl won't be here for hours.
That was just an excuse to get away."</p>

<p>But there was a smile of triumph on Von Schwerin's lips.</p>

<p>"I know them better than you do, Fischer," he declared.
"Nikasti is our man!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="first">HIGH up in one of the topmost chambers of the
Hotel Plaza, Nikasti, after his conference with Von Schwerin and
Fischer, sought solitude. He opened the high windows, out of
which he could scarcely see, dragged up a chest of drawers and
perched himself, Oriental fashion, on the top, his long yellow
fingers intertwined around his knees, his soft brown eyes gazing
over the wooded slopes of the Park. He was away from the clamour
of tongues, from the poisoned clouds of sophistry, even from the
disturbance of his own thoughts, incited by specious arguments
to some form of reciprocity. Here he sat in the clouds and
searched for the true things. His eyes seemed to be travelling
over the battlefields of Europe. He saw the swaying fortunes of
mighty armies, he looked into council chambers, he seemed to
feel the pulses of the great world force which kept going this
most amazing Juggernaut. He saw the furnaces of Japan, blazing
by night and day; saw the forms of hundreds of thousands of his
fellow creatures bent to their task; saw the streams of ships
leaving his ports, laden down with stores; saw the great guns
speeding across Siberia, the endless trains of ammunition, the
rifles, food for the famine-stricken giants who beat upon the
air with empty fists. He saw the gold come streaming back. He
saw it poured into the banks, the pockets of the merchants, the
homes of his people. He saw brightening days throughout the
land. He saw the slow but splendid strength of the nation
rejoicing in its new possibilities. And beyond that, what?
Wealth was the great means towards the great end, but if the
great end were once lost sight of, there was no more hideous
poison than that stream of enervating prosperity. He remembered
his own diatribes concerning the decadence of England; how he
had pointed to the gold poison, to the easy living of the poor,
the blatant luxury of the rich. He had pointed to the soft
limbs, the cities which had become pools of sensuality, to the
daily life which, calling for no effort, had seen the passing of
the spirit and the triumph of the gross. And what about his own
people? Mankind was the same the world over. The gold which was
bringing strength and life to the nation might very soon exude
the same poisonous fumes, might very soon be laying its thrall
upon a people to whom living had become an easier thing. However
it might be for other, the Western nations, for his own he
firmly believed that war alone, with its thousand privations,
its call to the chivalry of his people, was the one great
safeguard. China! The days had gone by when the taking of China
could inspire. It was to greater things they must look.
Australia. New Zealand! Had any Western race the right to flaunt
her Empire's flag in Asiatic seas? And America! Once again he
felt the slow rising of wrath as he recalled the insults of past
years ... the adventurous sons of his country treated like
savages and negroes by that uncultured, strong-limbed race of
coarse-fibered, unimaginative materialists. There was a call,
indeed, to the soul of his country to avenge, to make safe, the
homes and lives of her colonists. Across the seas he looked into
the council chambers of the wise men of his race. He saw the men
whose word would tell. He watched their faces turned towards
him, waiting; heard the beginning of the conflict of thoughts
and minds&mdash;blind fidelity to the cause which they had
espoused, or a rougher, more splendid, more selfish stroke for
the greatness of Japan and Japan only. "If we break our faith we
lose our honour," one murmured. "There is no honour save the
care of my people," he heard one of his greatest countrymen
reply.</p>

<p>So he sat and thought, revolved in his mind arguments,
morals, philosophy. It was the problem which had confronted the
great Emperor, his own ancestor, who had lived for three months
on the floor of the Temple, asking but one question of the
Silent Powers: "Through what gate shall I lead my nation to
greatness?"</p>

<p>The senses of the man who crouched in his curious attitude,
with his eyes still piercing the heavens, were mobile and
extraordinary things. No disturbing sounds had reached him from
outside. His isolation seemed complete and impregnable. Yet,
without turning his head, he was perfectly conscious of the slow
opening of the door. His whole frame stiffened. He was conscious
for one bitter second of a lapse from the careful guarding of
his ways. That second passed, however, and left him prepared
even for danger, his brain and muscles alike tense. He turned
his head. The expression of slow surprise, which even parted his
lips and narrowed his eyes, was only half assumed.</p>

<p>"What do you wish?" he asked.</p>

<p>Lutchester did not for a moment reply. He had closed the door
behind him carefully, and was looking around the room now with
evident interest. Its bareness of furniture and decoration were
noteworthy, but on the top of the ugly chest of drawers was a
great bowl of roses, a queer little ivory figure set in an
arched frame of copper&mdash;a figure almost sacerdotal, with
its face turned towards the east&mdash;and a little shower of
rose leaves, which could scarcely have fallen there by accident,
at the foot of the pedestal. Lutchester inclined his head
gravely, as he looked towards it, a gesture entirely
reverential, almost an obeisance. Nikasti's eyes were clouded
with curiosity. He slipped down to the ground.</p>

<p>"I have travelled in your country," Lutchester said gravely,
as though in explanation. "I have visited your temples. I may
say that I have prayed there."</p>

<p>"And now?" Nikasti asked.</p>

<p>"I am for my country what you are for yours," Lutchester
proceeded. "You see, I know when it is best to speak the truth.
I am in New York because you are in New York, and if you leave
on Saturday for Japan it may happen&mdash;of this I am not
sure&mdash;but I say that it may happen that I shall accompany
you."</p>

<p>"I shall be much honoured," Nikasti murmured.</p>

<p>"You came here," Lutchester continued, "to meet an emissary
from Berlin. Your country, which could listen to no official
word from any one of her official enemies, can yet, through you,
learn what is in their minds. You have seen to-day Fischer and
the Baron von Schwerin. Fischer has probably presented to you
the letter which he has brought from Berlin. Von Schwerin has
expounded further the proposition and the price which form part
of his offer."</p>

<p>Nikasti's face was imperturbable, but there was trouble in
his eyes.</p>

<p>"You have found your way to much knowledge," he
muttered.</p>

<p>"I must find my way to more. I must know what Germany offers
you. I must know what is at the back of your mind when you
repeat this offer in Tokio."</p>

<p>"You can make, then, the unwilling speak?" Nikasti
demanded.</p>

<p>"Even that is amongst the possibilities," Lutchester
affirmed. "Strange things have been done for the cause which
such as you and I revere."</p>

<p>Nikasti showed his white teeth for a moment in a smile meant
to be contemptuous.</p>

<p>"It is a great riddle, this, which we toss from one to the
other," he observed. "I am the simple valet of two gentlemen
living in the hotel. You have listened, perhaps, to fairy tales,
or dreamed them yourself, sir."</p>

<p>"It is no fairy tale," Lutchester rejoined, "that you are
Prince Nikasti, the third son of the great Marquis Ato, that you
and I met more than once in London when you were living there
some years ago; that you travelled through our country, and drew
up so scathing an indictment of our domestic and industrial
position that, but for their clumsy diplomacy, your country
would probably have made overtures to Germany. Ever since those
days I have wondered about you. I have wondered whether you are
with your country in her friendship towards England."</p>

<p>"I have no friends but my country's friends," Nikasti
declared, "no enemies save her enemies. But to-day those things
of which you have spoken do not concern me. I am the Japanese
valet of Mr. Fischer and Mr. Van Teyl."</p>

<p>Lutchester, as though by accident, came a step further into
the room. Nikasti's eyes never left his face. Perhaps at that
moment each knew the other's purpose, though their tongues clung
to the other things.</p>

<p>"Will you talk to me, Japan?" Lutchester asked calmly. "You
have listened to Germany. I am England."</p>

<p>"If you have anything to say," Nikasti replied, "Baron Yung
is at Washington."</p>

<p>"You and I know well," Lutchester continued, "that
ambassadors are but the figureheads in the world's history.
Speak to me of the things which concern our nations, Nikasti.
Tell me of the letter you bear to the Emperor. You have nothing
to lose. Sit down and talk to me, man to man. You have heard
Germany. Hear England. Tell me of the promises made to you
within the last hour, and I will show you how they can never be
kept. Let us talk of your country's future. You and I can tell
one another much."</p>

<p>"A valet knows nothing," Nikasti murmured.</p>

<p>Lutchester came a step nearer. Nikasti, in retreating, was
now almost in a corner of the room.</p>

<p>"Listen," Lutchester went on, "for many years I have
suspected that you are an enemy of my country. That is the
reason why, when our Intelligence Department learnt of your
mission, I chose to come myself to meet you. And now we meet,
Nikasti, face to face, and all that you are willing to do for
your country, I am willing to do for mine, and unless you sit
down and talk this matter out with me as man to man, you will
not leave New York."</p>

<p>The arm of the Japanese stole with the most perfect
naturalness inside his coat, and Lutchester knew then that the
die was cast. The line of blue steel flashed out too late. The
hand which gripped the strangely-shaped little knife was held as
though in a vice, and Lutchester's other arm was suddenly thrown
around the neck of his assailant, his fingers pressed against
his windpipe.</p>

<p>"Drop the knife," he ordered.</p>

<p>It fell clattering on to the hard floor. Nikasti, however,
twisted himself almost free, took a flying leap sideways, and
seized his adversary's leg. In another moment he came down upon
the floor with a crash. Lutchester's grip upon him, a little
crueller now, was like a band of steel.</p>

Nikasti came down upon the floor with a crash. Lutchester's<br>
grip upon him, a little crueller now, was like a band of steel.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>"There are many ways of playing this game. It is you who have
chosen this one," he said. "It's no use, Nikasti. I know as much
of your own science as you do. You're my man now until I choose
to let you free, and before I do that I am going to read the
letter which you are taking to Japan."</p>

<p>Nikasti's eyes were red with fury, but every movement was
torture. Lutchester held him easily with one hand, felt over him
with the other, drew the letter from his vest, and, shaking it
free from its envelope, held it out and read it. When he had
finished, he replaced it in the envelope and pushed it back into
the other's breast pocket.</p>

<p>"Now," he directed, "you can get up."</p>

<p>Nikasti scrambled to his feet. There were livid marks under
his eyes. For a moment he had lost all his vitality, he was like
a beaten creature.</p>

<p>"You would never have done this," he muttered, "ten years
ago, I grow old."</p>

<p>"So that is the letter which you are taking to your Emperor!"
Lutchester said. "You think it worth while! You can really see
the German fleet steaming past the British Isles, out into the
Atlantic, and bombarding New York!"</p>

<p>Nikasti made no reply. Lutchester looked at him for a moment
thoughtfully. There was a light once more in the beaten man's
eyes&mdash;a queer, secretive gleam. Lutchester stooped down and
picked up the knife from the floor.</p>

<p>"Nikasti," he enjoined, "listen to me, for your country's
sake. The promise contained in that letter is barely worth the
paper it is written on, so long as the British fleet remains
what it is. But, apart from that, I tell you here, of my own
profound conviction&mdash;and I will prove it to you before many
days are past&mdash;Germany does not intend to keep this
promise."</p>

<p>Nikasti made no reply. His face was expressionless.</p>

<p>"Germany has but one idea," Lutchester continued. "She means
to play you and America off against one another. I have found
out her offer to you. All I can say is, if you take it seriously
you are not the man I think you. Now I will tell you what I am
going to do. I am going to find out her offer to America. I will
bring that to you, and you shall see the two side by side. Then
you shall know how much you can rely upon a country whose
diplomacy is bred and born of lies, who cheats at every move of
the game, who makes you a deliberate offer here which she never
has the least intention of keeping. Have you anything to say to
me, Nikasti?"</p>

<p>Nikasti raised his eyes for one moment.</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say," he replied. "I am the valet of Mr.
Fischer and Mr. Van Teyl. These things are not of my
concern."</p>

<p>Lutchester shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Whatever you may be," he concluded, "and however much you
may resent all that has happened, I know that you will wait. I
might go direct to Washington, but I prefer to come to you, if
it remains possible. Before you leave this country we will meet
again, and, when you have heard me, you will tear that letter
which you are treasuring next your heart into small pieces."</p>

<p>Lutchester turned and left the room, closing the door behind
him. Nikasti crouched in his place without movement. The ache in
his heart seemed to be shining out of his face. He turned slowly
towards the little figure of black ivory, his head drooped
lower&mdash;he was filled with a great shame.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="first">FISCHER raised his eyebrows in mild surprise to
find Nikasti waiting for him in the sitting room that evening,
with his overcoat and evening hat. He closed the door of the
bedroom from which he had issued carefully behind him.</p>

<p>"You don't need to go on with this business now that we have
had our little talk," he remonstrated.</p>

<p>"I cannot leave until the twentieth," Nikasti replied. "I
think it best that I remain here. Your cocktail, sir."</p>

<p>Fischer accepted the glass with a good-humoured little
laugh.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I suppose you know what you want to do, but
it seems to me unnecessary. Say, is anything wrong with you? You
seem shaken, somehow."</p>

<p>"I am quite well," Nikasti declared gravely. "I am very well
indeed."</p>

<p>Fischer stared at him searchingly from behind his
spectacles.</p>

<p>"You don't look it," he observed. "If you'll take my advice,
you'll get away from here and rest somewhere quietly for a few
days. Why don't you try one of the summer hotels on Long
Island?"</p>

<p>Nikasti shook his head.</p>

<p>"Until I sail," he decided, "I stay here. It is better
so."</p>

<p>"You know best, of course," Fischer replied. "Where's Mr. Van
Teyl?"</p>

<p>"He has gone out with his sister, sir&mdash;the young lady in
the next suite," Nikasti announced.</p>

<p>Fischer sighed for a moment. Then he finished his cocktail,
drew on his gloves, and turned towards the door.</p>

<p>"Well, good night," he said. "Perhaps you are wise to stay
here. Remember always what it is that you carry about with
you."</p>

<p>"I shall remember," Nikasti promised.</p>

<p>Fischer entered his automobile and drove to a fashionable
restaurant in the neighbourhood of Fifth Avenue. Arrived here,
he made his way to a room on the first floor, into which he was
ushered by one of the head waiters. Von Schwerin was already
there, talking with a little company of men.</p>

<p>"Ah, our friend Fischer!" the latter exclaimed. "That makes
our number complete."</p>

<p>A waiter handed around cocktails. Fischer smiled as he raised
his glass to his lips.</p>

<p>"It is something, at least," he confided, "to be back in a
country where one can speak freely. I raise my arm. Von Schwerin
and gentlemen&mdash;'To the Fatherland!'"</p>

<p>They all drank fervently and with a little guttural murmur.
Von Schwerin set down his empty glass. He was looking a little
glum.</p>

<p>"In many ways, my dear Fischer," he said, "one sympathises
with that speech of yours; but the truth is best, and it is to
talk truths that we have met this evening. We are gaining no
ground here. I am not sure that we are not losing."</p>

<p>There was a moment's disturbed and agitated silence.</p>

<p>"It is bad to hear," one little man acknowledged, with a
sigh, "but who can doubt it? There is a fever which has caught
hold of this country, which blazes in the towns and smoulders in
the country places, and that is the fever of money-making. Men
are blinded with the passion of it. They tell me that even Otto
Schmidt in Milwaukee has turned his great factories into
ammunition works."</p>

<p>Von Schwerin's eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"Let him be careful," he muttered, "that one morning those
are not blackened walls upon which he looks! We go to dinner
now, gentlemen, and, until we are alone afterwards, not one word
concerning the great things."</p>

<p>The partition doors leading into the dining room were thrown
back and the little company of men sat down to dine. There were
fourteen of them, and their names were known throughout the
world. There was a steel millionaire, half-a-dozen Wall Street
magnates, a clothing manufacturer, whose house in Fifth Avenue
was reputed to have cost two millions. There was not one of them
who was not a patriot&mdash;to Germany. They ate and drank
through the courses of an abnormally long dinner with the
businesslike thoroughness of their race. When at last the coffee
and liqueurs had been served, the waiters by prearrangement
disappeared, and with a little flourish Von Schwerin locked the
door. Once more he raised his glass.</p>

<p>"To the Kaiser and the Fatherland!" he cried in a voice thick
with emotion.</p>

<p>For a moment a little flash of something almost like
spirituality lightened the gathering. They were at least men
with a purpose, and an unselfish purpose.</p>

<p>"Oscar Fischer," Von Schwerin said, "my friends, all of you,
you know how strenuous my labours have been during the last
year. You know that three times the English Ambassador has
almost demanded my recall, and three times the matter has hung
in the balance. I have watched events in Washington, not through
my own but through a thousand eyes. My fingers are on the pulse
of the country, so what I say to you needs nothing in the way of
substantiation. The truth is best. Notwithstanding all my
efforts, and the efforts of every one of you, the great momentum
of public feeling, from California to Massachusetts, has turned
slowly towards the cause of our enemies. Washington is
hopelessly against us. The huge supplies which leave these
shores day by day for England and France will continue. Fresh
plants are being laid down for the manufacture of weapons and
ammunition to be used against our country. The hand of diplomacy
is powerless. We can struggle no longer. Even those who favour
our cause are drunk with the joy of the golden harvest they are
reaping. This country has spoken once and for all, and its voice
is for our most hated enemy."</p>

<p>There were a variety of guttural and sympathetic
ejaculations. A dozen earnest faces turned towards Von
Schwerin.</p>

<p>"Diplomacy," Von Schwerin continued, "has failed. We come to
the next step. There have been isolated acts of self-sacrifice,
splendid in themselves but systemless. Only the day before
yesterday a great factory at Detroit was burned to the ground,
and I can assure you, gentlemen, I who know, that a thousand
bales of cloth, destined for France, lie in a charred, heap
amongst the ruins. That fire was no accident."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence. Fischer nodded approvingly. Von
Schwerin filled his glass.</p>

<p>"This," he went on, "was the individual act of a brave and
faithful patriot. The time has come for us, too, to remember
that we are at war. I have striven for you with the weapons of
diplomacy and I have failed. I ask you now to face the situation
with me&mdash;to make use of the only means left to us."</p>

<p>No one hesitated. Possibly ruin stared them in the face, but
not one flinched. Their heads drew closer together. They
discussed the ways and means of the new campaign.</p>

<p>"We must add largely to our numbers," Von Schwerin said, "and
we had better have a fund. So far as regards money, I take it
for granted&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a little chorus of fierce whispers. Five million
dollars were subscribed by men who were willing, if necessary,
to find fifty.</p>

<p>"It is enough," their leader assured them. "Much of our
labours will be amongst those to whom money is no object. Only
remember, all of you, this. We shall be a society without a
written word, with no roll of membership, without documents or
institution, for complicity in the things which follow will mean
ruin. You are willing to face that?"</p>

<p>Again that strange, passionate instinct of unanimity
prevailed. To all appearance it was a gathering of commonplace,
commercialised and bourgeois, easy-living men, but the touch of
the spirit was there. Fischer leaned a little forward.</p>

<p>"In two months' time," he said, "every factory in America
which is earning its blood money shall be in danger. There will
be a reign of terror. Each State will operate independently and
secretly."</p>

<p>"Our friend Fischer," Von Schwerin told them, "has promised
to stay over here for the present to organise this undertaking.
I, alas! am bound to remain always a little aloof, but the time
may come, and very soon, too, when I shall be a free lance. On
that day I shall throw my lot in with yours, to the last drop of
my blood and the last hour of my liberty. Until then, trust
Oscar Fischer. He has done great deeds already. He will show you
the way to more."</p>

<p>Fischer took off his spectacles and wiped them.</p>

<p>"Our first proceeding," he said, "sounds paradoxical. It must
be that we cease to exist. There can be no longer any meetings
amongst us who stand in this country for Germany. Gatherings of
this sort are finished. We meet, one or two of us, perhaps, by
accident, in the clubs and in the streets, in our houses and
perhaps in the restaurants, but the bond which unites us, and
which no human power could ever sever because it is of the
spirit, that bond from to-night is intangible. Wait, all of you,
for a message. The task given to each shall not be too
great."</p>

<p>Mr. Max H. Bookam, a little black-bearded man who had started
life tailoring in a garret, and was now a multi-millionaire,
raised his glass.</p>

<p>"No task shall seem too great," he muttered. "No risk shall
make us afraid. Even the exile shall take up his burden."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="first">MR. FISCHER'S business later on that night led
him into unsavoury parts. He left his car at the corner of
Fourteenth Street, and, after a moment's reflection, as though
to refresh his memory, he made his way slowly eastwards. He wore
an unusually shabby overcoat, and a felt hat drawn over his
eyes, both of which garments he had concealed in the automobile.
Even then, however, his appearance made him an object of some
comment. A little gang of toughs first jostled him and then
turned and followed in his footsteps. A man came out of the
shadows, and they broke away with an oath.</p>

<p>"That cop'll get his head broke some day," Fischer heard one
of them mutter, with appropriate adjectives.</p>

<p>There were others who looked curiously at him. One man's hand
he felt running over his pockets as he pushed past him. A couple
of women came screaming down the street and seized him by the
arms. He shook himself free, and listened without a word to
their torrent of abuse. The lights here seemed to burn more
dimly. Even the flares from the drinking dens seemed secretive,
and the shadowy places impenetrable. It was before a saloon that
at last he paused, listened for a moment to the sound of a
cracked piano inside, and entered. The place was packed, and,
fortunately for him, a scrap of some interest between two
villainous-looking Italians in a distant corner was occupying
the attention of many of the patrons. A man with white, staring
face was banging at a crazy piano without a movement of his
body, his whole energies apparently directed towards drowning
the tumult of oaths and hideous execrations which came from the
two combatants. A drunken Irishman, rolling about on the floor,
kicked at him savagely as he passed. An undersized little
creature, with the face of an old man but the figure of a boy,
marked him from a distant corner and crept stealthily towards
his side. Fischer reached the counter at last and stood there
for a moment, waiting. Two huge, rough-looking negroes, in
soiled linen clothes, were dispensing the drinks. As one of them
passed, Fischer struck the counter with his forefinger, six or
seven times, observing a particular rhythm. The negro started,
turned his heavily-lidded, repulsive eyes upon Fischer, and
nodded slightly. He handed out the drink he had in his hand, and
leaned over the counter.</p>

<p>"Want the boss?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Fischer assented. The negro lifted the flap of the counter
and opened a trapdoor, leading apparently into a cellar
beneath.</p>

<p>"Step right down," he muttered. "Don't let the boys catch on.
Get out of that, Tim," he added thickly to the dwarflike figure,
whose slender fingers were suddenly nearing Fischer's neck.</p>

<p>The creature seemed to melt away. Fischer dived and descended
a dozen steps or so into another bare looking apartment, the
door of which was half open. There were three men seated at the
solitary deal table, which was almost the only article of
furniture to be seen. One, sombrely dressed in legal black, with
a pale face and fiercely inquiring eyes, half rose to his feet
as the newcomer entered. Another's hand went to his hip pocket.
The man who was sitting between the two, however&mdash;a great
red-headed Irishman&mdash;rose to his feet and pushed them back
to their places.</p>

<p>"There's no cause for alarm, now, boys," he declared. "This
is a friend of mine. I won't make you acquainted, because we're
all better friends strangers down in these parts. Hop it off,
you two. Sit down here, Mr. Stranger."</p>

<p>The two men stole away. The Irishman poured out a glassful of
neat whisky and passed it to his visitor.</p>

<p>"Clients of mine," he explained. "Tim Crooks is in politics.
Got your message, boss. What's the figure?"</p>

<p>"Two thousand!"</p>

<p>The Irishman whistled and looked thoughtfully down at the
table.</p>

<p>"Isn't it enough?" Fischer asked.</p>

<p>"Enough?" was the hoarse reply. "Why, there isn't one of my
toughs that wouldn't go rat-hunting for a quarter of that. If
it's any one in these parts, twelve hours is all I want."</p>

<p>"It isn't!"</p>

<p>The Irishman's face fell.</p>

<p>"Some swell, I suppose? Fifth Avenue way and the swagger
parts, eh?"</p>

<p>Fischer assented silently. His host poured himself out some
whisky and drank it as though it were water.</p>

<p>"You see, boss," he pointed out, "it's no use sending
greenhorns out on a job like that, because they only squeak if
they're pinched, and pinched they're sure to be; and all my
regulars are what we call in sanctuary."</p>

<p>"You mean they are hiding already?"</p>

<p>"That's some truth," was the grim admission. "The cops ain't
going to trouble to come after 'em, so long as they keep here,
but they'd nab 'em fast enough if they showed their noses beyond
the end of Fourteenth. Still, I'd like to oblige you, guv'nor. I
don't know who you are, and don't want, but my boys speak fine
of you. You know Ed Swindles?"</p>

<p>"Not by name," Fischer confessed.</p>

<p>"He did that little job up at Detroit," the Irishman went on,
dropping his voice a little. "I tell you he's a genius at
handling a bomb, is Ed. Blew that old factory into brick-ends,
he did. He's in the saloon upstairs&mdash;got his girl with him.
They've been doing a round of the dancing saloons."</p>

<p>"That's all right, but what about this job?" Fischer
inquired, a little impatiently.</p>

<p>The Irishman glanced behind him. Then he dropped his voice a
little.</p>

<p>"Look here, guv'nor," he said, "I've some idea, if it pans
out. You've heard of the Heste case?"</p>

<p>"You mean the girl who was murdered?"</p>

<p>"Yes! Well, the chap that did it is within a few feet of
where we're sitting."</p>

<p>Fischer took off his spectacles and rubbed them. In the dim
light his face looked more grim and powerful than ever.</p>

<p>"Isn't that a little dangerous?" he observed. "The police
mean having him."</p>

<p>"You're dead right," the Irishman replied. "They've got to
have him, and he knows it. They'd keep their hands off any one
in these parts if they could, but this bloke's different. He
done it too thick, and he's got the public squealing. Now if we
could get him out for long enough, he's the man for your job.
Come right along, boss."</p>

<p>He rose heavily to his feet, crossed the room, and threw open
the door of what was little more than a cupboard at the further
end. The place was in darkness, but a human form sprang suddenly
upward. His white face and glaring eyes were the only visible
objects in a shroud of darkness.</p>

<br>

The place was in darkness, but a human form sprang suddenly

</div>

<br>

<p>"That's all right, kid," the Irishman said soothingly. "No
cops yet. This is a gentleman on business. Wait till I fix a
light."</p>

<p>He stepped back, and brought a candle from the table at which
he had been seated. Fischer helped him light it, and by degrees
the interior of the little apartment was illuminated. Its
contents were almost negligible&mdash;there was simply a foul
piece of rug in the corner, and a broken chair. With his back to
the wall crouched a slim, apparently young man, with a perfectly
bloodless face and black eyes under which were blue lines. His
clothes were torn and covered with dust, as though he had
dragged himself about the floor, and one of his hands was
bleeding.</p>

<p>"The gentleman's on business, Jake," his host repeated.</p>

<p>"Give me some whisky," the young man mumbled.</p>

<p>The Irishman shaded his eyes.</p>

<p>"Holy Moses! why, you've finished that bottle!" he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It's like water," the fugitive replied in a hot whisper, "I
drink and I feel nothing; I taste nothing&mdash;I forget
nothing! Give me something stronger."</p>

<p>He tossed off without hesitation the tumbler half full of
whisky which his guardian fetched him. Then he came out.</p>

<p>"I'm sick of this," he declared. "I'll sit at your table.
It's no use talking to me of jobs," he went on. "I couldn't get
out of here. I made for the docks, but they headed me off. They
know where I am. They'll have me sooner or later."</p>

<p>"Yes, they'll have you right enough," the Irishman assented;
"but if there was any chance in the world, this gent could give
it to you. He's got a job he wants done up amongst the swells in
Fifth Avenue, and there's money enough in it to buy Anna
herself, if you want her. Anna's our real toff down here," he
explained, turning to Fischer, "and all the boys are crazy about
her."</p>

<p>Jake shook his head, unimpressed. He fixed his eyes upon
Fischer, moistened his lips a little, and spoke in a sort of
croaky whisper.</p>

<p>"Money's no use to me," he said, "nor women either&mdash;I'm
through with them. You know what I done? I killed my girl.
That's what I'm going to the chair for. But if I could get out
of this, I'd do your job. I'm kind of hating people. I can't get
my girl's face out of my mind. Perhaps if I did your job I'd
have another one to think about."</p>

<p>"Pleasant company, ain't he?" the Irishman grunted. "He's the
real goods."</p>

<p>Fischer stared at the young man as though fascinated. He
seemed beyond and outside human comprehension. Their host was
sitting with his hands in his pockets and his feet on another
chair. The braces hung from his shoulders upon the floor, his
collarless shirt had fallen a little open. His face, with its
little tuft of red side whiskers and unshaven chin, was
reminiscent of the forests.</p>

<p>"If you want this job fixed, Mr. Stranger," he said, "I don't
know as Jake here couldn't take it on. It'd have to be done like
this. Jake's a real toney chauffeur&mdash;drive anything. If you
had your automobile at a spot I could tell you of one evening,
just at dusk, I might get him that far, in a set of chauffeur's
clothes. Once on the box of your auto, he'd be out of this and
could give 'em the slip for a bit. It's the only way I can think
of, to get him near the game."</p>

<p>"The arrangement would suit me," Fischer admitted.</p>

<p>Jake suddenly showed a gleaming set of unexpectedly white
teeth. His eyes stared more than ever.</p>

<p>"I'm game! I'm on to this," he cried fiercely. "You can have
all there is coming to me, Sullivan, if I get nabbed, but I'm
going to take my risk. I hate this hole! It's a rat's den."</p>

<p>"Then get you back to your cupboard, Jake," the Irishman
enjoined. "I've got to talk business to the gent."</p>

<p>The young man rose to his feet. He took the bottle of whisky
under his arm. His face was still ashen, but his tone was
steady. He gripped Fischer by the arm.</p>

<p>"I will do your job," he promised. "I will do it
thoroughly."</p>

<p>He slouched across the floor, entered his cupboard, and
disappeared. Fischer was suddenly aware of the moisture upon his
forehead. There was something animal-like, absolutely inhuman,
about this creature with whom he had made his murderous
bargain.</p>

<p>"I have no money here, of course," he reminded his
companion.</p>

<p>"Don't know as I blame you, guv'nor," the other observed with
a grin. "I saw my toughs lay out a guy only the other day for
flashing a smaller wad than you'd carry. You know the rules, and
I guess I'll ring up the bank to-morrow morning at eleven
o'clock. Does that go?"</p>

<p>"You'll find the deposit there," Fischer promised. "You'd
better let me know when he's ready to take the job on."</p>

<p>The Irishman walked to the foot of the steps with his
visitor.</p>

<p>"Give Joe the double knock on the trapdoor," he directed,
"and get out of the saloon as quick as you can. There's a Dago
about there keeps our hands full. Got anything with you?"</p>

<p>Fischer nodded. His hand stole out of his overcoat
pocket.</p>

<p>"Better give them one if they look like trouble," his host
advised. "They've plenty of spunk, but I can tell you they make
tracks for their holes if they hear one of those things
bark."</p>

<p>"They shall hear it fast enough, if they try to hustle me,"
Fischer observed grimly.</p>

<p>"You've some pluck," the Irishman declared, as he watched his
departing guest ascend the steps. "Sure, this is no place for
cowards, anyway. And good night and good luck to you! Jake will
do your job slick, if any one could."</p>

<p>Fischer beat his little tattoo upon the trapdoor, crawled
through it and underneath the flap in the counter, out into the
saloon. He paused for a moment to look around, on his way to the
door. The fight was apparently over, for every one was standing
at the counter, drinking with a swarthy-faced man whose cheeks
were stained with blood. From a distant corner came the sound of
groans. The air seemed heavier than ever with foul tobacco
smoke. The man at the piano still thrashed out his unmelodious
chords. Some women in a corner were pretending to dance. One or
two of them looked curiously at Fischer, but he passed out,
unchallenged. Even the air of the slum outside seemed pure and
fresh after the heated den he had left. He reached the corner of
the street in safety and stepped quickly into his car. He threw
both windows wide open and murmured an order to the chauffeur.
Then he leaned back and closed his eyes for a moment. He was a
man not overburdened with imagination, but it seemed to him just
then that he would never be able altogether to forget the face
of that ghastly, dehumanised creature, crouching like some
terrified wild animal in his fetid refuge.</p>

<h2><a id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="first">MRS. THEODORE HASTINGS was forty-eight years
old, which her friends said was the reason why her mansion on
Fifth Avenue was furnished and lit with the delicate sombreness
of an old Italian palace. There was about it none of the
garishness, the almost resplendent brilliancy associated with
the abodes of many of our neighbours. Although her masseuse
confidently assured her that she looked twenty-eight, Mrs.
Hastings preferred not to put the matter to the test. She
received her carefully selected dinner guests in a great library
with cedarwood walls, furnished with almost Victorian sobriety,
and illuminated by myriads of hidden lights. Pamela, being a
relative, received the special consideration of an
affectionately bestowed embrace.</p>

<p>"Pamela, my child, wasn't it splendid I heard that you were
in New York!" she exclaimed. "Quite by accident, too. I think
you treat your relatives shamefully."</p>

<p>Her niece laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, you're the first of them I've seen at all, and
directly Jim told me he was coming to you, I made him ring up in
case you had room for me."</p>

<p>"Jimmy was a dear," Mrs. Hastings declared, "and, of course,
there couldn't be a time when there wouldn't be room for you.
Even now, at the last moment, though, I haven't quite made up my
mind where to put you. Choose, dear. Will you have a Western
bishop or a rather dull Englishman?"</p>

<p>"What is the name of the Englishman?" Pamela asked, with
sudden intuition.</p>

<p>"Lutchester, dear. Quite a nice name, but I know nothing
about him. He brought letters to your uncle. Rather a queer time
for Englishmen to be travelling about, we thought, but still,
there he is. Seems to have found some people he knows&mdash;and
I declare he is coming towards you!"</p>

<p>"I met him in London," Pamela whispered, "and I never could
get on with bishops."</p>

<p>The dinner table was large, and arranged with that wonderful
simplicity which Mrs. Hastings had adopted as the keynote of her
New York parties. She had taken, in fact, simplicity under her
wing and made a new thing of it. There were more flowers than
silver, and cut glass than heavy plate. There seemed to be an
almost ostentatious desire to conceal the fact that Mr. Hastings
had robbed the American public of a good many million
dollars.</p>

<p>"Of course," Pamela declared, as they took their places, and
she nodded a greeting to some friends around the table, "fate is
throwing us together in the most unaccountable manner."</p>

<p>"I accept its vagaries with resignation," Lutchester replied.
"Besides, it is quite time we met again. You promised to show me
New York, and I haven't seen you for days."</p>

<p>"I don't even remember the promise," Pamela laughed, "but in
any case I have changed my mind. I am not sure that you are the
nice, simple-minded person you profess to be. I begin to have
doubts about you."</p>

<p>"Interest grows with mystery," Lutchester remarked
complacently. "Let us hope that I am promoted in your mind."</p>

<p>"Well, I am not at all sure. Of course, I am not an
Englishman, so it is of no particular interest to me, but if you
really came over here on important affairs, I am not sure that I
approve of your playing golf the day after your arrival."</p>

<p>"That, perhaps, was thoughtless," he admitted, "but one gets
so short of exercise on board ship."</p>

<p>"Of course," Pamela observed tentatively, "I'd forgive you
even now if you'd only be a little more frank with me."</p>

<p>"I am prepared to be candour itself," he assured her.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she begged, "the whole extent of your mission in
America?"</p>

<p>He glanced around.</p>

<p>"If we were alone," he replied, "I might court indiscretion
so far as to tell you."</p>

<p>"Then we will leave the answer to that question until after
dinner," she said.</p>

<p>She talked to her left-hand neighbour for a few moments, and
Lutchester followed suit. They turned to one another again,
however, at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>"I have conceived," she told him, "a great admiration for Mr.
Oscar Fischer."</p>

<p>"A very able man," Lutchester agreed.</p>

<p>"He is not only that," Pamela continued, "but he is a man
with large principles and great ideas."</p>

<p>"Principles!" Lutchester murmured.</p>

<p>"Of course, you don't like him," Pamela went on, "and I don't
wonder at it. He is thoroughly German, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Almost prejudiced, I'm afraid," Lutchester assented.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," Pamela protested. "Why, he's German by
birth, and although you English people are much too pig-headed
to see any good in an enemy, I think you must admit that the way
they all hang together&mdash; Germans, I mean, all over the
world&mdash;is perfectly wonderful."</p>

<p>"There have been a few remarks of the same sort," Lutchester
reminded her, "about the inhabitants of the British
Empire&mdash;Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders, for
instance."</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," Pamela admitted generously, "I
consider that your Colonials understand the word patriotism
better than the ordinary Englishman. With them, as with the
Germans, it is almost a passionate impulse. Your hearts may be
in the right places, but you always give one the impression of
finding the whole thing rather a bore."</p>

<p>"Well, so it is," Lutchester insisted. "Who wants to give up
a very agreeable profession and enter upon a career of
bloodshed, abandon all one's habits, and lose most of one's
friends? No, we are honest about that, at any rate! Germany may
be enjoying this war. We aren't."</p>

<p>"What was your profession?" Pamela inquired.</p>

<p>"Diplomacy," Lutchester confided. "I intended to become an
ambassador."</p>

<p>"Do you think you have the requisite gifts?"</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>"Secrecy, subtlety, caution, and highly-developed
intelligence," she replied. "How's that?"</p>

<p>"All those gifts," he assured her, "I possess."</p>

<p>She fanned herself for a moment and looked at him.</p>

<p>"We are not a modest race ourselves," she said, "but I think
you can give us a lead. By the bye, were you playing golf with
Senator Hamblin by accident the other afternoon?"</p>

<p>"You mean the old Johnny down at Baltusrol?" he asked coolly.
"I picked him up wandering about by the professionals'
shed."</p>

<p>"Did you talk politics with him?"</p>

<p>"We gassed a bit about the war," Lutchester admitted
cheerfully.</p>

<p>Pamela laughed. She leaned a little forward. The buzz of
conversation now was insistent all around them.</p>

<p>"Of you two," she whispered, "I prefer Fischer."</p>

<p>Lutchester considered the matter for some time.</p>

<p>"Well, there's no accounting for tastes," he said presently.
"I shouldn't have thought him exactly your type."</p>

<p>"He may not be," Pamela confessed, "but at least he has the
courage to speak what is in his mind."</p>

<p>Lutchester smiled.</p>

<p>"So Fischer has taken you into his confidence, has he?" he
murmured. "Well, now, that seems queer to me. I should have
thought your interests would have lain the other way."</p>

<p>"As an individual?"</p>

<p>"As an American."</p>

<p>"I am not wholly convinced of that."</p>

<p>"Come," he protested, "what is the use of a friend from whom
you are separated by an unnegotiable space?"</p>

<p>"What unnegotiable space?"</p>

<p>"The Atlantic."</p>

<p>"And why is the Atlantic unnegotiable?"</p>

<p>"Because of a little affair called the British fleet,"
Lutchester pointed out.</p>

<p>"There is also," she reminded him drily, "a German fleet, and
they haven't met yet."</p>

<p>"Ah! I had almost forgotten there was such a thing," he
murmured. "Where do they keep it?"</p>

<p>"You know. You aren't nearly so stupid as you pretend to be,"
she said, a little impatiently. "I should like you so much
better if you would be frank with me."</p>

<p>"What about those qualifications for my ambassadorial
career?" he reminded her&mdash;"Secrecy, subtlety, caution."</p>

<p>"The master of these," she whispered, rising to her feet in
response to her hostess's signal, "knows when to abandon
them&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lutchester changed his place to a vacant chair by James Van
Teyl's side.</p>

<p>"I was going to ask you, Mr. Van Teyl," he inquired, "whether
your Japanese servant was altogether a success? I think I shall
have to get a temporary servant while I am over here."</p>

<p>"Nikasti was entirely Fischer's affair," Van Teyl replied,
"and I can't say much about him as I have given up my share of
the apartments at the Plaza. The fellow's all right, I dare say,
but we hadn't the slightest use for a valet. The man on the
floor's good enough for any one."</p>

<p>"By the bye," Lutchester inquired, "is Fischer still in New
York?"</p>

<p>"No, he's in Washington," Van Teyl replied. "I believe he's
expected back to-morrow.... Say, can I ask you a question?"</p>

<p>Lutchester almost imperceptibly drew his chair a little
closer.</p>

<p>"Of course you can," he assented.</p>

<p>"What I want to know," Van Teyl continued confidentially, "is
how you get that long run on your cleek shots? I saw you play
the sixteenth hole, and it looked to me as though the ball were
never going to stop."</p>

<p>Lutchester smiled.</p>

<p>"I have made a special study of that shot," he confided.
"Yes, I can tell you how it's done, but it needs a lot of
practice. It's done in turning over the wrists sharply just at
the moment of impact. You get everything there is to be got into
the stroke that way, and you keep the ball low, too."</p>

<p>"Gee, I must try that!" Van Teyl observed, making spasmodic
movements with his wrists. "When could we have a day down at
Baltusrol?"</p>

<p>"It will have to be next week, I'm afraid, if you don't
mind," Lutchester replied. "I've a good many appointments in New
York, and I may have to go to Washington myself. By the bye, I
thought our host lived there."</p>

<p>"So he does," Van Teyl assented. "Nowadays, though, it seems
to have become the fashion for politicians to own a house up in
New York and do some entertaining here. They're after the
financial interest, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Is your uncle a keen politician?"</p>

<p>"Keen as mustard," Van Teyl answered. "So's my aunt. She'd
give her soul to have the old man nominated for the
Presidency."</p>

<p>"Any chance of it?"</p>

<p>"Not an earthly! He'll come a mucker, though, some day,
trying. He'd take any outside chance. For a clever man he's the
vainest thing I know."</p>

<p>Lutchester smiled enigmatically as he followed the example of
the others and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Even in America, then," he observed, "your great men have
their weaknesses."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="first">FISCHER, exactly one week after his nocturnal
visit to Fourteenth Street, hurried out of the train at the
Pennsylvania Station, almost tore the newspapers from the news
stand, glanced through them one by one and threw them back. The
attendant, open-mouthed, ventured upon a mild protest. Fischer
threw him a dollar bill, caught up his handbag, and made for the
entrance. He was the first passenger from the Washington Limited
to reach the street and spring into a taxi.</p>

<p>"The Plaza Hotel," he ordered. "Get along."</p>

<p>They arrived at the Plaza in less than ten minutes. Mr.
Fischer tipped the driver lavishly, suffered the hall porter to
take his bag, returned his greeting mechanically, and walked
with swift haste to the tape machine. He held up the strips with
shaking fingers, dropped them again, hurried to the lift, and
entered his rooms. Nikasti was in the sitting-room, arranging
some flowers. Fischer did not even stop to reply to his
reverential greeting.</p>

<p>"Where's Mr. Van Teyl?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Mr. Van Teyl has gone away, sir," was the calm reply. "He
left here the day before yesterday. There is a letter."</p>

<p>Fischer took no notice. He was already gripping the telephone
receiver.</p>

<p>"982, Wall," he said&mdash;"an urgent call."</p>

<p>He stood waiting, his face an epitome of breathless suspense.
Soon a voice answered him.</p>

<p>"That the office of Neville, Brooks and Van Teyl?" he
demanded. "Yes! Put me through to Mr. Van Teyl. Urgent!"</p>

<p>Another few seconds of waiting, then once more he bent over
the instrument.</p>

<p>"That you, Van Teyl?... Yes, Fischer speaking. Oh, never mind
about that! Listen. What price are Anglo-French?... No, say
about what?... Ninety-five?... Sell me a hundred thousand....
What's that?... What?... Of course it's a big deal! Never mind
that. I'm good enough, aren't I? There'll be no rise that'll
wipe out half a million dollars. I've got that lying in cash at
Guggenheimer's. If you need the money, I'll bring it you in half
an hour. Get out into the market and sell. Damn you, what's it
matter about news! Right! Sorry, Jim. See you later."</p>

<p>Fischer put down the telephone and wiped his forehead.
Notwithstanding the fatigue in his face, there was a glint of
triumph there. He laid his hand upon Nikasti's shoulder.</p>

<p>"My friend," he said, "there's big proof coming of what I
said to you the other day. You'll find that letter you carry
will mean a different thing now. There's news in the air."</p>

<p>"There has been a great battle, perhaps?" Nikasti asked
slowly.</p>

<p>"All that is to be known you will hear before evening,"
Fischer replied. "Tell some one to send me some coffee. I have
come through from Washington. I am tired."</p>

<p>He sank a little abruptly into an easy-chair, took off his
spectacles, and leaned his head back upon the cushions. In the
sunlight his face was almost ghastly. A queer sense of weakness
had suddenly assailed him. His mind flitted back through a vista
of sleepless nights, of strenuous days, of passions held in
leash, excitement ground down.</p>

<p>"I am tired," he said. "Telephone down to the office,
Nikasti, for a doctor."</p>

<p>Nikasti obeyed, and his summons was promptly answered. The
doctor who arrived was pleasantly but ominously grave. In the
middle of his examination the telephone rang. Fischer, without
ceremony, moved to the receiver. It was Van Teyl speaking.</p>

<p>"I've sold your hundred thousand Anglo-French," he announced.
"It's done the whole market in, though&mdash;knocked the bottom
out of it. They've fallen a point and a half. Shall I begin to
buy back for you? You'll make a bit."</p>

<p>"Not a share," Fischer answered fiercely. "Wait!"</p>

<p>"Have you any news you're keeping up your sleeve?" Van Teyl
persisted.</p>

<p>"If I have, it's my own affair," was the curt reply, "and I
don't tell news over the telephone, anyway. Watch the market,
and go on selling where you can."</p>

<p>"I shall do as you order," Van Teyl replied, "but you're all
against the general tone here. By the bye, you got my
letter?"</p>

<p>"I haven't opened it yet," Fischer snapped. "What's the
matter?"</p>

<p>"Pamela and I have taken a little flat in Fifty-eighth
Street. Seems a little abrupt, but she didn't want to be alone,
and she hates hotels. We felt sure you'd understand."</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand," Fischer said. "Good-by! I'm busy."</p>

<p>The doctor completed his examination. When he had finished he
mentioned his fee.</p>

<p>"You work too hard, and you live in an atmosphere of too
great strain. The natural consequences are already beginning to
show themselves. If I give you medicine, it will only encourage
you to keep on wasting yourself, but you can have medicine if
you like."</p>

<p>"Send me something to take for the next fortnight," Fischer
replied. "After that, I'll take my chance."</p>

<p>The doctor wrote a prescription and took his leave. Fischer
leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes. His mind travelled
back through these latter days of his over-strenuous life. In
such minutes of relaxation, few of which he permitted himself,
he realised with bitter completeness the catastrophe which had
overtaken him&mdash;him, Oscar Fischer, of all men on earth.
Into his life of grim purposes, of lofty and yet narrow
ambitions, of almost superhuman tenacity, had crept the one
weakening strain whose presence in other men he had always
scoffed at and derived. There was a new and enervating glamour
over the days, a new and hatefully powerful rival for all his
thoughts and dreams. Ten years ago, he reflected sadly, this
might have made a different man of him, might have unlocked the
gates into another, more peaceful and beautiful world, visions
of which had sometimes vaguely disturbed him in his cold and
selfish climb. Now it could only mean suffering. This was the
first stroke. It was the assertion of humanity which was
responsible for his present weakness. How far might it not drag
him down?</p>

<p>There should be a fight, at any rate, he told himself, as an
hour or two later he made his way downtown. He paid several
calls in the vicinity of Wall Street, and finished up in Van
Teyl's office. That young man greeted him with a certain
relief.</p>

<p>"You know the tone of the market's still against you,
Fischer," he warned him once more.</p>

<p>Fischer threw himself into the client's easy-chair. The
furniture in the office seemed less distinct than usual. He was
conscious of a certain haziness of outline in everything. Van
Teyl's face, even, was shrouded in a little mist. Then he
suddenly found himself fighting fiercely, fighting for his
consciousness, fighting against a wave of giddiness, a deadly
sinking of the heart, a strange slackening of all his nerve
power. The young stockbroker rose hastily to his feet.</p>

<p>"Anything wrong, old fellow?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"A glass of water," Fischer begged.</p>

<p>He was conscious of drinking it, vaguely conscious that he
was winning. Soon the office had regained its ordinary
appearance, his pulse was beating more regularly. He had once
more the feeling of living&mdash;of living, though in a minor
key.</p>

<p>"A touch of liver," he murmured. "What did you say about the
markets?"</p>

<p>"You look pretty rotten," Van Teyl remarked sympathetically.
"Shall I send out for some brandy?"</p>

<p>"Not for me," Fischer scoffed. "I don't need it. What price
are Anglo-French?"</p>

<p>"Ninety-four. You've only done them in a point, after all,
and that's nominal. I daresay I could get ten thousand back at
that."</p>

<p>"Let them alone," was the calm reply. "I'll sell another
fifty thousand at ninety-four."</p>

<p>"Look here," Van Teyl said, swinging round in his chair, "I
like the business and I know you can finance it, but are you
sure that you realise what you are doing? Every one believes
Anglo-French have touched their bottom. They've only to go back
to where they were&mdash;say five points&mdash;and you'd lose
half a million."</p>

<p>Fischer smiled a little wearily.</p>

<p>"That small sum in arithmetic," he remonstrated, "had already
passed through my brain. Send in your selling order, Jim, and
come out to lunch with me. I've come straight through from
Washington&mdash;only got in this morning."</p>

<p>Van Teyl called in his clerk and gave a few orders. Then he
took up his hat and left the office with his client.</p>

<p>"From Washington, eh?" he remarked curiously, as they passed
into the crowded streets. "So that accounts&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly. His companion's warning fingers had
tightened upon his arm.</p>

<p>"Quite right!" Van Teyl confessed. "There's gossip enough
about now, and they seem to have tumbled to it that you're our
client. The office has been besieged this morning. Sorry, Ned,
I'm busy," he went on, to a man who tried to catch his arm. "See
you later, Fred. I'll be in after lunch, Mr. Borrodaile. No,
nothing fresh that I know of."</p>

<p>Fischer smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"Got you into a kind of hornets' nest, eh?" he observed.</p>

<p>"It's been like this all the morning," Van Teyl told him.
"They believe I know something. Even the newspaper men are
tumbling to it. We'll lunch up at the club. Maybe we'll get a
little peace there."</p>

<p>They stepped into the hall of a great building, and took one
of the interminable row of lifts. A few minutes later they were
seated at a side table in a dining room on the top floor of one
of the huge modern skyscrapers. Below them stretched a silent
panorama of the city; beyond, a picturesque view of the river. A
fresh breeze blew in through the opened window. They were above
the noise, even, of the street cars.</p>

<p>"Order me a small bottle of champagne, James," Fischer
begged, "and some steak."</p>

<p>Van Teyl stared at his companion and laughed as he took up
the wine list.</p>

<p>"Well, that's the first time, Fischer, I've known you to
touch a drop of anything before the evening! I'll have a whisky
and soda with you. Thank God we're away from that inquisitive
crowd for a few minutes! Are you going to give me an idea of
what's moving?"</p>

<p>Fischer watched the wine being poured into his glass.</p>

<p>"Not until this evening," he said. "I want you to bring your
sister and come and dine at the new roof-garden."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether Pamela has any engagement," Van Teyl
began, a little dubiously.</p>

<p>"Please go and see," Fischer begged earnestly. "The
telephones are just outside. Tell your sister that I
particularly wish her to accept my invitation. Tell her that
there will be news."</p>

<p>Van Teyl went out to the telephone. Fischer sipped his
champagne and crumbled up his bread, his eyes fixed a little
dreamily on the grey river. He was already conscious of the glow
of the wine in his veins. The sensation was half pleasurable, in
a sense distasteful to him. He resented this artificial
humanity. He had the feeling of a man who has stooped to be
doped by a quack doctor. And he was a little afraid.</p>

<p>His young companion returned triumphant.</p>

<p>"Had a little trouble with Pamela," he observed, as he
resumed his place at the table. "She was thinking of the opera
with a girl friend she picked up this morning. However, the idea
of news, I think, clinched it. We'll be at the Oriental at eight
o'clock, eh?"</p>

<p>Fischer looked up from the fascinating patchwork below.
Already there was anticipation in his face.</p>

<p>"I am very glad," he said. "There will certainly be
news."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="first">"NOW indeed I feel that I am in New York,"
Pamela declared, as she broke off one of the blossoms of the
great cluster of deep red roses by her side, and gazed downward
over her shoulder at the far-flung carpet of lights. "One sees
little bits of America in every country of the world, but never
this."</p>

<p>Fischer, unusually grave and funereal-looking in his dinner
clothes and black tie, followed her gesture with thoughtful
eyes. Everything that was ugly in the stretching arms of the
city seemed softened, shrouded and bejewelled. Even the sounds,
the rattle and roar of the overhead railways, the clanging of
the electric car bells, the shrieking of the sirens upon the
river, seemed somehow to have lost their harsh note, to have
become the human cry of the great live city, awaking and
stretching itself for the night.</p>

<p>"I agree with you," he said. "You dine at the Ritz-Carlton
and you might be in Paris. You dine here, and one knows that you
are in America."</p>

<p>"Yet even here we have become increasingly luxurious," Pamela
remarked, looking around. "The glass and linen upon the tables
are quite French; those shaded lights are exquisite. That little
band, too, was playing at the Ritz three years ago. I am sure
that the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> who brought us to our table was once at
the Cafe de Paris."</p>

<p>"Money would draw all those things from Europe even to the
Sahara," Fischer observed, "so long as there were plenty of it.
But millions could not buy our dining table in the clouds."</p>

<p>"A little effort of the imagination, fortunately," Pamela
laughed, looking upwards. "There are stars, but no clouds."</p>

<p>"I guess one of them is going to slip down to the next table
before long," Van Teyl observed, with a little movement of his
head.</p>

<p>They all three turned around and looked at the wonderful bank
of pink roses within a few feet of them.</p>

<p>"One of the opera women, I daresay," the young man continued.
"They are rather fond of this place."</p>

<p>Pamela leaned forward. Fischer was watching the streets
below; Only a short distance away was a huge newspaper building,
flaring with lights. The pavements fringing it were thronged
with a little stationary crowd. A row of motor-bicycles was in
waiting. A night edition of the paper was almost due.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fischer," she asked, "what about that news?"</p>

<p>He withdrew his eyes from the street. Almost unconsciously he
straightened himself a little in his place. There was pride in
his tone. Behind his spectacles his eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"I would have told it you before," he said, "but you would
not have believed it. Soon&mdash;in a very few moments&mdash;the news will
be known. You will see it break away in waves from that building
down there, so I will bear with your incredulity. The German and
British fleets have met, and the victory has remained with
us."</p>

<p>"With us?" Pamela repeated.</p>

<p>"With Germany," Fischer corrected himself hastily.</p>

<p>"Is this true?" James Van Teyl almost shouted. "Fischer, are
you sure of what you're saying? Why, it's incredible!"</p>

<p>"It is true," was the proud reply. "The German Navy has been
a long time proving itself. It has done so now. To-day every
German citizen is the proudest creature breathing. He knew
before that his armies were invincible. He knows now that his
fleet is destined to make his country the mistress of the seas.
England's day is over. Her ships were badly handled and
foolishly flung into battle. She has lost many of her finest
units. Her Navy is to-day a crippled and maimed force. The
German fleet is out in the North Sea, waiting for an enemy who
has disappeared."</p>

<p>"It is inconceivable," Pamela gasped.</p>

<p>"I do not ask you to believe my word," Fischer exclaimed.
"Look!"</p>

<p>As though the flood gates had been suddenly opened, the
stream of patient waiters broke away from the newspaper building
below. Like little fireflies, the motor-bicycles were tearing
down the different thoroughfares. Boys like ants, with their
burden of news sheets, were running in every direction.
Motor-trucks had started on their furious race. Even the distant
echoes of their cries came faintly up. Fischer called a
messenger and sent him for a paper.</p>

<p>"I do not know what report you will see," he said, "but from
whatever source it comes it will confirm my story. The news is
too great and sweeping to be contradicted or ignored."</p>

<p>"If it's true," Van Teyl muttered, "you've made a fortune in
my office to-day. It looks like it, too. There was something
wrong with Anglo-French beside your selling for the last hour
this afternoon. I couldn't get buyers to listen for a
moment."</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall have made a great deal of money," Fischer
admitted, "money which I shall value because it comes
magnificently, but I hope that this victory may help me to win
other things."</p>

<p>He looked fixedly at Pamela, and she moved uneasily in her
chair. Almost unconsciously the man himself seemed somehow
associated with his cause, to be assuming a larger and more
tolerant place in her thoughts. Perhaps there was some measure
of greatness about him after all. The strain of waiting for the
papers became almost intolerable. At last the boy reappeared.
The great black headlines were stretched out before her. She
felt the envelopment of Fischer's triumph. The words were there
in solid type, and the paper itself was one of the most
reliable.</p>

<br>

<p class="headline">
GREAT NAVAL BATTLE IN THE NORTH SEA<br>
BRITISH ADMIRALTY ADMITS SERIOUS LOSSES<br>
"QUEEN MARY," "INDEFATIGABLE," AND MANY FINE SHIPS LOST.</p>

<br>

<p>Pamela looked up from the sheet.</p>

<p>"It is too wonderful," she whispered, with a note of awe in
her tone. "I don't think that any one ever expected this. We all
believed in the British Navy."</p>

<p>"There is nothing," Fischer declared, "that England can do
which Germany cannot do better."</p>

<p>"And America best of all," Pamela said.</p>

<p>Fischer bowed.</p>

<p>"That is one comparison which will never now be made," he
declared, "for from to-night Germany and America will draw
nearer together. The bubble of British naval omnipotence is
pricked."</p>

<p>"Meanwhile," Van Teyl observed, putting his paper away, "we
are neglecting our dinner. Nothing like a good dose of
sensationalism for giving us an appetite."</p>

<p>Fischer was watching his glass being filled with champagne.
He seized it by the stem. His eyes for a moment travelled
upwards.</p>

<p>"I am an American citizen," he said, with a strange fervour
in his tone, "but for the moment I am called back. And so I lift
my glass and I drink&mdash;I alone, without invitation to you
others&mdash;to those brave souls who have made of the North Sea a
holy battle-ground."</p>

<p>He drained his glass and set it down empty. Pamela watched
him as though fascinated. For a single moment she was conscious
of a queer sensation of personal pity for some shadowy and
absent friend, of something almost like a lump in her throat, a
strange instinct of antagonism towards the man by her side so
enveloped in beatific satisfaction&mdash;then she frowned when she
realised that she had been thinking of Lutchester, that her
first impulse had been one of sympathy for him. The moment
passed. The service of dinner was pressed more insistently upon
them. James Van Teyl, who had been leaning back in his chair,
talking to one of the <i>ma&icirc;tres d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, dismissed him with a
little nod and entrusted them with a confidence.</p>

<p>"Say, do you know who's coming to the next table?" he
exclaimed. "Sonia!"</p>

<p>They were all interested.</p>

<p>"You won't mind?" Fischer asked diffidently.</p>

<p>"In a restaurant, how absurd!" Pamela laughed. "Why, I'm
dying to see her. I wonder how it is that some of these greatest
singers in the world lead such extraordinary lives that people
can never know anything of them."</p>

<p>"Society is tolerant enough nowadays," her brother observed,
"but Sonia won't give them even a decent chance to wink at her
eccentricities. She crossed, you know, on the Prince Doronda's
yacht, for fear they wouldn't let her land."</p>

<p>"Here she comes," Pamela whispered.</p>

<p>There was a moment's spellbound silence. Two <i>ma&icirc;tres
d'h&ocirc;tel</i> were hurrying in front. A pathway from the lift had
been cleared as though for a royal personage. Sonia, in white
from head to foot, a dream of white lace and chinchilla, with a
Russian crown of pearls in her glossy black hair, and a rope of
pearls around her neck, came like a waxen figure, with scarlet
lips and flashing eyes, towards her table. And behind
her&mdash;Lutchester! Pamela felt her fingers gripping the
tablecloth. Her first impulse, curiously enough, was one of wild
fury with herself for that single instant's pity. Her face grew
cold and hard. She felt herself sitting a little more upright.
Her eyes remained fixed upon the newcomers.</p>

Sonia came like a waxen figure. And behind her&mdash;Luchester!</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>Lutchester's behaviour was admirable. His glance swept their
little table without even a shadow of interest. He ignored with
passive unconcern the mistake of Van Teyl's attempted greeting.
He looked through Fischer as though he had been a ghost. He
stood by Sonia's side while she seated herself, and listened
with courteous pleasure to her excited admiration of the flowers
and the wonderful vista. Then he took his own place. In his
right hand he was carrying an evening paper with its flaming
headlines.</p>

<p>"That," Fischer pronounced, struggling to keep the joy from
his tone, "is very British and very magnificent!"</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>Pamela had imperfect recollections of the rest of the
evening. She remembered that she was more than usually gay
throughout dinner-time, but that she was the first to jump at
the idea of a hurried departure and a visit to a cabaret. Every
now and then she caught a glimpse of Sonia's face, saw the
challenging light in her brilliant eyes, heard little scraps of
her conversation. The Frenchwoman spoke always in her own
language, with a rather shrill voice, which made Lutchester's
replies sound graver and quieter than usual. More than once
Pamela's eyes rested upon the broad lines of his back. He sat
all the time like a rock, courteous, at times obviously amusing,
but underneath it all she fancied that she saw some signs of the
disturbance from which she herself was suffering. She rose to
her feet at last with a little sigh of relief. It was an ordeal
through which she had passed.</p>

<p>Once in the lift, her brother and Fischer discussed
Lutchester's indiscretion volubly.</p>

<p>"I suppose," Van Teyl declared, "that there isn't a man in
New York who wouldn't have jumped at the chance of dining alone
with Sonia, but for an Englishman, on a night like this," he
went on, glancing at the paper, "say, he must have some
nerve!"</p>

<p>"Or else," Fischer remarked, "a wonderful indifference. So
far as I have studied the Anglo-Saxon temperament, I should be
inclined to vote for the indifference. That is why I think
Germany will win the war. Every man in that country prays for
his country's success, not only in words, but with his soul. I
have not found the same spirit in England."</p>

<p>"The English people," Pamela interposed, "have a genius for
concealment which amounts to stupidity."</p>

<p>"I have a theory," Fischer said, "that to be phlegmatic after
a certain pitch is a sign of low vitality. However, we shall
see. Certainly, if England is to be saved from her present
trouble, it will not be the Lutchesters of the world who will do
it, nor, it seems, her Navy."</p>

<p>They found their way to a large cabaret, where Pamela
listened to an indifferent performance a little wearily. The
news of what was termed a naval disaster to Great Britain was
flashed upon the screen, and, generally speaking, the audience
was stunned. Fischer behaved throughout the evening with tact
and discretion. He made few references to the matter, and was
careful not to indulge in any undue exhilaration. Once, when Van
Teyl had left the box, however, to speak to some friends, he
turned earnestly to Pamela.</p>

<p>"Will it please you soon," he begged, "to resume our
conversation of the other day? However you may look at it,
things have changed, have they not? An invincible British Navy
has been one of the fundamental principles of beliefs in
American politics. Now that it is destroyed, the outlook is
different. I could go myself to the proper quarter in
Washington, or Von Schwerin is here to be my spokesman. I have a
fancy, though, to work with you. You know why."</p>

<p>She moved uneasily in her place.</p>

<p>"I have no idea," she objected, "what it is that you have to
propose. Besides, I am only just a woman who has been entrusted
with a few diplomatic errands."</p>

<p>"You are the niece of Senator Hastings," Fischer reminded
her, "and Hastings is the man through whom I should like my
proposal to go to the President. It is an honest offer which I
have to make, and although it cannot pass through official
channels, it is official in the highest sense of the word,
because it comes to me from the one man who is in a position to
make himself responsible for it."</p>

<p>Her brother came back to the box before Pamela could reply,
but, as they parted that night, she gave Fischer her hand.</p>

<p>"Come and see our new quarters," she invited. "I shall be at
home any time to-morrow afternoon."</p>

<p>It was one of the moments of Fischer's life. He bowed low
over her fingers.</p>

<p>"I accept, with great pleasure," he murmured.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch55"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="first">Sonia had the air of one steeped in an almost
ecstatic content. On her return from the roof garden she had
exchanged her wonderful gown for a white silk negligee, and her
headdress of pearls for a quaint little cap. She was stretched
upon a sofa drawn before the wide-flung French windows of her
little sitting-room at the Ritz-Carlton, a salon decorated in
pink and white, and filled almost to overflowing with the roses
which she loved. By her side, in an easy chair which she had
pressed him to draw up to her couch, sat Lutchester.</p>

<p>"This," she murmured, "is one of the evenings which I adore.
I have no work, no engagements&mdash;just one friend with whom
to talk. My fine clothes have done. I am myself," she added,
stretching out her arms. "I have my cigarettes, my iced sherbet,
and the lights and murmur of the city there below to soothe me.
And you to talk with me, my friend. What are you thinking of
me&mdash;that I am a little animal who loves comfort too much,
eh?"</p>

<p>Lutchester smiled.</p>

<p>"We all love comfort," he replied. "Some of us are franker
than others about it."</p>

<p>She made a little grimace.</p>

<p>"Comfort! It is my own word, but what a word! It is luxury I
worship&mdash; luxury&mdash;and a friend. Is that, perhaps,
another word too slight, eh?"</p>

<p>He met the provocative gleam of her eyes with a smile of
amusement.</p>

<p>"You are just the same child, Sonia," he remarked. "Neither
climate nor country, nor the few passing years, can change
you."</p>

<p>"It is you who have grown older and sterner," she pouted. "It
is you who have lost the gift of living to-day as though
to-morrow were not. There was a time, was there not, John,
when you did not care to sit always so far away?"</p>

<p>She laid her hand&mdash;ringless, over-manicured, but
delicately white&mdash;&mdash; upon his. He smoothed it
gently.</p>

<p>"You see, Sonia," he sighed, "troubles have come that harden
the hearts even of the gayest of us."</p>

<p>She frowned.</p>

<p>"You are not going to remind me&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>"If I reminded you of anything, Sonia," he interrupted, "I
would remind you that you are a Frenchwoman."</p>

<p>She stretched out her hand restlessly and took one of the
Russian cigarettes from a bowl by her side.</p>

<p>"You are not, by any chance, going to talk seriously, dear
John?"</p>

<p>"I am," he assured her, "very seriously."</p>

<p>"Oh, la, la!" she laughed. "You, my dear, gay companion, you
who have shaken the bells all your life, you are going to talk
seriously! And to-night, when we meet again after so long. Ah,
well, why should I be surprised?" she went on, with a pout.</p>

<p>"You have changed. When one looks into your face, one sees
the difference. But to me, of all people in the world! Why talk
seriously to me! I am just Sonia, the gipsy nightingale. I know
nothing of serious things."</p>

<p>"You carry one very serious secret in your heart," he told
her gravely, "one little pain which must sometimes stab you. You
are a Frenchwoman, and yet&mdash; "</p>

<p>Lutchester paused for a moment. Sonia, too, seemed suddenly
to have awakened into a state of tense and vivid emotion. The
cigarette burned away between her fingers. Her great eyes were
fixed upon Lutchester. There was something almost like fear in
their questioning depths.</p>

Her great eyes were fixed upon Lutchester. There<br>

</div>

<br>

<p>"Finish! Finish!" she insisted. "Continue!"</p>

<p>"And yet," he went on, "your very dear friend, the friend for
whose sake you are here in America, is your country's
enemy."</p>

<p>She raised herself a little upon the couch.</p>

<p>"That is not true," she declared furiously. "Maurice loves
France. His heart aches for the misery that has come upon her.
It is your country only which he hates. If France had but
possessed the courage to stand by herself, to resist when
England forced her friendship upon her, none of this tragedy
would ever have happened. Maurice has told me so himself. France
could have peace today, peace at her own price."</p>

<p>"There is no peace which would leave France with a soul, save
the peace which follows victory," Lutchester replied
sternly.</p>

<p>She crushed her cigarette nervously in her fingers, threw it
away, and lit another.</p>

<p>"I will not talk of these things with you," she cried. "It
was not for this that you sought me out, eh? Tell me at once?
Were these the thoughts you had in your mind when you sent your
little note?&mdash;when you chose to show yourself once more in
my life?"</p>

<p>For the first time of his own accord, he drew his chair a
little nearer to hers. He took her hand. She gave him both
unresistingly.</p>

<p>"Listen, dear Sonia," he said, "it is true that I am a
changed man. I am older than when we met last, and there are the
other things. You remember the Ch&acirc;teau d'Albert?"</p>

<p>"Of course!" she murmured. "And the young Duc d'Albert's
wonderful house party. We all motored there from Paris. You and
I were together! You have forgotten that, eh?"</p>

<p>"I lay in that orchard for two days," he went on grimly,
"with a hole in my side and one leg pretty nearly done for. I
saw things I can never forget, in those days, Sonia. D'Albert
himself was killed. It was in that first mad rush. Of the
Chateau there remains but four blackened walls."</p>

<p>"<i>Pauvre enfant</i>!" she murmured. "But you are well and
strong again now, is it not so? You will not fight again, eh?
You were never a soldier, dear friend."</p>

<p>"Just now," he confided, "I have other work to do. It is that
other work which has brought me to America."</p>

<p>She drew him a little closer to her. Her eyes questioned
him.</p>

<p>"There is, perhaps, now," she asked, "a woman in your
life?"</p>

<p>"There is," he admitted.</p>

<p>She made a grimace.</p>

<p>"But how clumsy to tell me, even though I asked," she
exclaimed. "What is she like? ... But no, I do not wish to hear
of her! If she is all the world to you, why did you send me that
little note? Why are you here?"</p>

<p>"Because we were once dear friends, Sonia," he said, "because
I wish to save you from great trouble."</p>

<p>She shrank from him a little fearfully.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Sonia," he continued, with a note of sternness in his tone,
"during the last two years you have gone back and forth between
New York and Paris, six times. I do not think that you can make
that journey again."</p>

<p>She was standing now, with one hand gripping the edge of the
table.</p>

<p>"John! ... John! ... What do you mean?" she demanded, and
this time her own voice was hard.</p>

<p>"I mean," he said, "that when you leave here for Paris you
will be watched day and night. The moment you set foot upon
French soil you will be arrested and searched. If anything is
found upon you, such as a message from your friend in
Washington&mdash;well, you know what it would mean. Can't you
see, you foolish child, the risk you have been running? Would
you care to be branded as a spy?&mdash; you, a daughter of
France?"</p>

<p>She struck at him. Her lace sleeves had fallen back, and her
white arm, with its little clenched fist, flashed through the
twilight, aimlessly yet passionately.</p>

<p>"You dare to call me a spy! You, John?" she shrieked. "But it
is horrible."</p>

<p>"It is the work of a spy," he told her gravely, "to bring a
letter from any person in a friendly capital and deliver it to
an enemy. That is what you have done, Sonia, many times since
the beginning of the war, so far without detection. It is
because you are Sonia that I have come to save you from doing it
again."</p>

<p>She groped her way back to the couch. She threw herself upon
it with her back towards him, her head buried in her hands.</p>

<p>"The letters are only between friends," she faltered. "They
have nothing to do with the war."</p>

<p>"You may have believed that," Lutchester replied gently, "but
it is not true. You have been made the bearer of confidential
communications from the Austrian Embassy here to certain people
in Paris whom we will not name. I have pledged my word, Sonia,
that this shall cease."</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet. All the feline joy of her languorous
ease seemed to have departed. She was quivering and nervous. She
stood over her writing-table.</p>

<p>"A telegraph blank!" she exclaimed. "Quick! I will not see
Maurice again. Oh, how I have suffered! This shall end it. See,
I have written 'Good-by!' He will understand. If he comes, I
will not see him. Ring the bell quickly. There&mdash; it is
finished!"</p>

<p>A page-boy appeared, and she handed him the telegram. Then
she turned a little pathetically to Lutchester.</p>

<p>"Maurice was foolish&mdash;very often foolish," she went on
unsteadily, "but he has loved me, and a woman loves love so
much. Now I shall be lonely. And yet, there is a great weight
gone from my mind. Always I wondered about those letters. You
will be my friend, John? You will not leave me all alone?"</p>

<p>He patted her hand.</p>

<p>"Dear Sonia," he whispered, "solitude is not the worst thing
one has to bear, these days. Try and remember, won't you, that
all the men who might have loved you are fighting for your
country, one way or another."</p>

<p>"It is all so sad," she faltered, "and you&mdash;you are so
stern and changed."</p>

<p>"It is with me only as it is with the whole world," he told
her. "To-night, though, you have relieved me of one
anxiety."</p>

<p>Her eyes once more were for a moment frightened.</p>

<p>"There was danger for poor little me?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"It is past," he assured her.</p>

<p>"And it is you who have saved me," she murmured. "Ah, Mr.
John," she added, as she walked with him to the door, "if ever
there comes to me a lover, not for the days only but <i>pour la
vie,</i> I hope that he may be an Englishman like you, whom all
the world trusts."</p>

<p>He laughed and raised her fingers to his lips.</p>

<p>"Over-faithful, you called us once," he reminded her.</p>

<p>"But that was when I was a child," she said, "and in days
like these we are children no longer."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="first">LUTCHESTER left Sonia and the Ritz-Carlton a
few minutes before midnight, to find a great yellow moon
overhead, which seemed to have risen somewhere at the back of
Central Park. The broad thoroughfare up which he turned seemed
to have developed a new and unfamiliar beauty. The electric
lamps shone with a pale and almost unnatural glow. The flashing
lights of the automobiles passing up and down were almost
whimsically unnecessary. Lutchester walked slowly up Fifth
Avenue in the direction of his hotel.</p>

<p>Something&mdash;the beauty of the night, perhaps, or some
faint aftermath of sentimentality born of Sonia's
emotion&mdash;tempted him during those few moments to relax. He
threw aside his mask and breathed the freer for it. Once more he
was a human being, treading the streets of a real city, his feet
very much upon the earth, his heart full of the simplest things.
All the scheming of the last few days was forgotten, the great
issues, the fine yet devious way to be steered amidst the rocks
which beset him; even the depression of the calamitous news from
the North Sea passed away. He was a very simple human being, and
he was in love. It was all so unpractical, so illusionary, and
yet so real. Events, actual happenings&mdash;he thrust all
thoughts of these away from his mind. What she might be thinking
of him at the moment he ignored. He was content to let his
thoughts rest upon her, to walk through the moonlit street, his
brain and heart revelling in that subtle facility of the
imagination which brought her so easily to his presence. It was
such a vividly real Pamela, too, who spoke and walked and moved
by his side. His memory failed him nowhere, followed faithfully
the kaleidoscopic changes in her face and tone, showed him even
that long, grateful, searching glance when their eyes had met in
Von Teyl's sitting-room. There had been times when she had shown
clearly enough that she was anxious to understand, anxious to
believe in him. He clung to the memory of these; pushed into the
background that faint impression he had had of her at the
roof-garden, serene and proud, yet with a faint look of something
like pain in her startled eyes.</p>

<p>A large limousine passed him slowly, crawling up Fifth
Avenue. Lutchester, with all his gifts of observation dormant,
took no notice of its occupant, who leaned forward, raised the
speaking-tube to his lips, and talked for a moment to his
chauffeur. The car glided round a side street and came to a
standstill against the curb. Its solitary passenger stepped
quietly out and entered a restaurant. The chauffeur backed the
car a little, slipped from his place, and followed
Lutchester.</p>

<p>By chance the little throng of people here became thicker for
a few moments and then ceased. Lutchester drew a little sigh of
relief as he saw before him almost an empty pavement. Then, just
as he was relapsing once more into thought, some part of his
subconscious instinct suddenly leaped into warning life. Without
any actual perception of what it might mean, he felt the thrill
of imminent danger, connected it with that soft footfall behind
him, and swung round in time to seize a deadly uplifted hand
which seemed to end in a shimmer of dull steel. His assailant
flung himself upon Lutchester with the lithe ferocity of a cat,
clinging to his body, twisting and turning his arm to wrest it
free. It was a matter of seconds only before his intended
victim, with a fierce backward twist, broke the man's wrist and,
wrenching himself free from the knees which clung around him,
flung him forcibly against the railings which bordered the
pavement. Lutchester paused for a moment to recover his breath
and looked around. A man from the other side of the street was
running towards them, but no one else seemed to have noticed the
struggle which had begun and finished in less than thirty
seconds. The man, who was half-way across the thoroughfare,
suddenly stopped short. He shouted a warning to Lutchester, who
swung around. His late assailant, who had been lying motionless,
had raised himself slightly, with a revolver clenched in his
left hand. Lutchester's spring on one side saved his life, for
the bullet passed so close to his cheek that he felt the rush
and heat of the air. The man in the center of the road was busy
shouting an alarm vociferously, and other people on both sides
of the thoroughfare were running up. Lutchester's eyes now never
left the dark, doubled-up figure upon the pavement. His whole
body was tense. He was prepared at the slightest movement to
spring in upon his would-be murderer. The man's eyes seemed to
be burning in his white face. He called out to Lutchester
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Don't move or I shall shoot!"</p>

<p>He looked up and down the street. One of the nearest of the
hastening figures was a policeman. He turned the revolver
against his own temple and pulled the trigger....</p>

<p>Lutchester and a policeman walked slowly back along Fifth
Avenue. Behind them, a little crowd was still gathered around
the spot from which the body of the dead man had already been
removed in an ambulance.</p>

<p>"I really remember nothing," Lutchester told his companion,
"until I heard the footsteps behind me, and, turning round, saw
the knife. This is simply an impression of mine&mdash;that he
might have descended from the car which passed me and stopped
just round the corner of that street."</p>

<p>"He's a chauffeur, right enough," the inspector remarked. "It
don't seem to have been a chance job, either. Looks as though he
meant doing you in. Got any enemies?"</p>

<p>"None that I know of," Lutchester answered cautiously. "Why,
the car's there still," he added, as they reached the
corner.</p>

<p>"And no chauffeur," the other muttered.</p>

<p>The officer searched the car and drew out a license from the
flap pocket. The commissionaire from the restaurant approached
them.</p>

<p>"Say, what are you doing with that car?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Better fetch the gentleman to whom it belongs," the
inspector directed.</p>

<p>"What's up, anyway?" the man persisted.</p>

<p>"You do as you're told," was the sharp reply.</p>

<p>The commissionaire disappeared. The officer studied the
license which he had just opened.</p>

<p>"What's the name?" Lutchester inquired.</p>

<p>The man hesitated for a moment, then passed it over.</p>

<p>"Oscar H. Fischer," he said. "Happen to know the name?"</p>

<p>Lutchester's face was immovable. He passed the license back
again. They both turned round. Mr. Fischer had issued from the
restaurant.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" he asked hastily. "The commissionaire says
you want me, Mr. Officer?"</p>

<p>The inspector produced his pocketbook.</p>

<p>"Just want to ask you a few questions about your chauffeur,
sir."</p>

<p>Fischer glanced at the driver's seat of the car, as though
aware of the man's disappearance for the first time.</p>

<p>"What's become of the fellow?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Shot himself," the inspector replied, "after a deliberate
attempt to murder this gentleman."</p>

<p>Mr. Fischer's composure was admirable. There was a touch of
gravity mingled with his bewilderment. Nevertheless, he avoided
meeting Lutchester's eyes.</p>

<p>"You horrify me!" he exclaimed. "Why, the fellow's only been
driving for me for a few hours."</p>

<p>"That so?" the officer remarked, with a grunt. "Get any
references with him?"</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, I did not," Fischer admitted frankly.
"I discharged my chauffeur yesterday, at a moment's notice, and
this man happened to call just as I was wanting the car out this
afternoon. He promised to bring me references to-morrow from Mr.
Gould and others. I engaged him on that understanding. He told
me that his name was Kay&mdash; Robert Kay. That is all that I
know about him, except that he was an excellent driver. I am
exceedingly sorry Mr. Lutchester," he went on, turning towards
him, "that this should have happened."</p>

<p>"So you two know one another, eh?" the officer observed.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we know one another!" Lutchester admitted
drily.</p>

<p>"I shall have to ask you both for your names and addresses,"
the official continued. "I think I won't ask you any more
questions at present. Seems to me headquarters had better take
this on."</p>

<p>"I shall be quite at your service," Lutchester promised.</p>

<p>The man made a few more notes, saluted, and took his leave.
Fischer and Lutchester remained for a moment upon the
pavement.</p>

<p>"It is a dangerous custom," Lutchester remarked, "to take a
servant without a reference."</p>

<p>"It will be a warning to me for the remainder of my life,"
Fischer declared.</p>

<p>"I, too, have learnt something," Lutchester concluded, as he
turned away.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="first">FISCHER, as he waited for Pamela the following
afternoon in the sitting-room of her flat on Fifty-eighth
Street, felt that although the practical future of his life
might be decided in other places, it was here that its real
climax would be reached. Pamela herself was to pronounce
sentence upon him. He was feeling scarcely at his best. An
examination in the courthouse, which he had imagined would last
only a few minutes, had been protracted throughout the
afternoon. The district attorney had asked him a great many
questions, some rather awkward ones, and the inquiry itself had
been almost grudgingly adjourned for a few hours. And here, in
Pamela's sitting-room, the first things which caught his eye
were the headlines of one of the afternoon papers:</p>

<br>

<p class="headline">WESTERN MILLIONAIRE ENGAGES THE GIRL
HESTE'S MURDERER AS CHAUFFEUR!<br>
ATTEMPTED MURDER AND SUICIDE IN FIFTH AVENUE LAST NIGHT.</p>

<p><br>
Fischer pushed the newspaper impatiently away, and, in the
act of doing so, the door was opened and Pamela entered. She
came towards him with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"I see you are looking at the account of your misdeeds," she
said, as she seated herself behind a tea tray. "Will you tell me
why a cautious man like you engages, without reference, a
chauffeur who turns out to be a murderer?"</p>

<p>Fischer frowned irritably.</p>

<p>"For four hours," he complained, "several lawyers and a most
inquisitive police captain have been asking me the same question
in a hundred different ways. I engaged the man because I needed
a chauffeur badly. He was to have brought his references this
morning. I was only trusting him for a matter of a few
hours."</p>

<p>"And during those few hours," she observed, "he seems to have
developed a violent antipathy to Mr. Lutchester."</p>

<p>"I do not understand the affair at all," Mr. Fischer
declared, "and, if I may say so, I am a little weary of it. I
came here to discuss another matter altogether."</p>

<p>She leaned back in her place.</p>

<p>"What have you come to discuss, Mr. Fischer?"</p>

<p>"That depends so much upon you," he replied. "If you give me
any encouragement, I can put before you a great proposition. If
your prejudices, however, remain as I think they always have
been, on the side of England, why then I can do nothing."</p>

<p>"If I counted for anything," Pamela said, "I mean to say if
it mattered to any one what my attitude was, I would start by
admitting that my sympathies are somewhat on the side of the
Allies. On the other hand, my sympathies amount to nothing at
all compared with my interest in the welfare of the United
States. I am perfectly selfish in that respect."</p>

<p>"Then you have an open mind to hear what I have to say,"
Fischer remarked. "I am glad of it. You encourage me to
proceed."</p>

<p>"That is all very well," Pamela said, stirring her tea, "but
I cannot help asking once more why you come to me at all? What
have I to do with any proposition you may have to make?"</p>

<p>"Just this," he explained. "I have a serious and authentic
proposition to make to the American Government. I cannot make it
officially&mdash; although it comes from the highest of all
sources&mdash;for the most obvious reasons. It may seem better
worth listening to to-day, perhaps, than a week ago, so far as
you are concerned. That is because you believed in British
invincibility upon the sea. I never did."</p>

<p>"Go on, please," Pamela begged. "I am still waiting to
realise my position in all this."</p>

<p>"I should like," Fischer declared, "my proposition to reach
the President through Senator Hastings, and Senator Hastings is
your uncle."</p>

<p>"I see," Pamela murmured.</p>

<p>"My offer itself is a very simple one," Fischer continued.
"Your secret service is so bad that you probably know nothing of
what is happening. Ours, on the other hand, is still
marvellously good, and what I am going to tell you is surely the
truth. Japan is accumulating great wealth. She is saving her
ships and men for one purpose, and one purpose only. Europe
could not bribe her highly enough to take a more active part in
this war. Her price was one which could not be paid. She
demanded a free hand with the United States."</p>

<p>"This," Pamela admitted, "is quite interesting, but it is
entirely in the realms of conjecture, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Not wholly," Fischer insisted. "At the proper time I should
be prepared to bring you evidence that tentative proposals were
made by Japan to both England and France, asking what would be
their attitude, should she provide them with half a million men
and undertake transport, if at the conclusion of the war she
desired a settlement with the United States. The answer from
France and England was the same&mdash;that they could not
countenance an inimical attitude towards the States."</p>

<p>"You are bound to admit, then," Pamela remarked, "that
England played the game here."</p>

<p>"The bribe was not big enough," Fischer replied drily.
"England would sell her soul, but not for a mess of pottage. To
proceed, however, Japan has practically kept out of the war. She
is enjoying a prosperity never known before, and for every
million pounds' worth of munitions she exports to Russia, she
puts calmly on one side twenty-five per cent, to accumulate for
her own use. At the conclusion of the war she will be in a
position she has never occupied before, and while the rest of
the world is still gasping, she will proceed to carry out what
has been the dream of her life&mdash;the invasion of your
Western States."</p>

<p>"I admit that this is plausible," Pamela confessed, "but you
are only pointing out a very obvious danger, for which I imagine
that we are already fairly well prepared."</p>

<p>"Believe me," Fischer said earnestly, "you are not. It is
this fact which makes the whole situation so vital to you. Later
on in our negotiations, I will show you proof of your danger.
Meanwhile, let me proceed to the offer which I am empowered to
make, which comes direct from the one person in Germany whose
word is unshakable."</p>

<p>Pamela changed her position a little, as though to escape
from the sunlight which was finding its way underneath the broad
blinds. Her eyes were fixed upon her visitor. She listened
intently to every word he had to say. Despite some vague feeling
of mistrust, which she acknowledged to herself might well have
been prejudiced, she found the situation interesting, even
stimulating. Her few excursions into the world of high politics
had never brought her into such a position as this. She felt
both flattered and interested&mdash;attracted, too, in some
nameless way, by the man's personality, his persistence, his
daring, his whole-heartedness. The situation was instinct with
interest to her.</p>

<p>"But why make it to me?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"You are to be my delegate," he answered. "Take the substance
of what I say to you, to your uncle. Try, for your country's
sake, to interest him in it. The offer which I make shall save
you a vast amount of sacrifice. It shall save your dislocating
the industries of the country and sowing the seeds of a
disturbing and yet inadequate militarism. I offer you, in short,
a German alliance against Japan."</p>

<p>"The value of that offer," Pamela remarked thoughtfully,
"would depend rather upon the issue of the present war, wouldn't
it?"</p>

<p>Fischer's face darkened. His tone was almost irritable.</p>

<p>"That is already preordained," he said firmly. "You see, I
will be quite frank with you. Germany has lost her chance of
sweeping and complete victory. The result of the war will be a
return to the status-quo-ante. Yet, believe me, Germany will be
strong enough to settle some of the debts she owes, and the debt
to Japan is one of these."</p>

<p>"Still, there is the practical question of getting men and
ships over from Germany to America," Pamela persisted.</p>

<p>"It is already solved," was the swift reply. "At the proper
time I will show you and prove how it can be done. At present,
not one word can pass my lips. It is one of the secrets on which
the future of Germany depends."</p>

<p>"And the price?" Pamela asked.</p>

<p>"That America adopts our view as to the high seas traffic,"
Fischer replied. "This would mean the stopping of all supplies,
munitions and ammunition from America to England. We offer you
an alliance. We ask only for your real and actual neutrality for
the remainder of the war. We offer a great and substantial
advantage, a safeguard for your country's future, in return for
what? Simply that America will pursue the course of honour and
integrity to all nations."</p>

<p>"America," Pamela declared, "has never failed in this."</p>

<p>Fischer shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"There is more than one point of view," he reminded her.
"Will you take my message with you to Washington to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Pamela promised, "I will do that. The rest, of course,
remains with others. I do not myself go so far, even," she
added, "as to declare myself in sympathy with you."</p>

<p>"And yet," he insisted, with swift violence, "it is your
sympathy which I desire more than anything in the
world&mdash;your sympathy, your help, your companionship; a
little&mdash;a very little at first&mdash;of your love."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that I am not a very satisfactory person from
that point of view," Pamela confessed. "I have a great sympathy
with every man who is really out for the great things, but so
far as you are concerned, Mr. Fischer, or any one else," she
went on, after a moment's hesitation, "I have no personal
feeling."</p>

<p>"That shall come," he declared.</p>

<p>"Then please wait a little time before you talk to me again
like this," she said, rising and holding out her hand. "At
present there is no sign of it."</p>

<p>"There is so much that I could offer you," he pleaded,
gripping the hand which she had given him in farewell, "so much
that I could do for your country. Believe me, I am not talking
idly."</p>

<p>"I do believe that," she admitted. "You are a very clever
man, Mr. Fischer, and I think that you represent all that you
claim. Perhaps, if we really do negotiate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you must!" he interrupted impatiently. "You must listen
to me for every reason&mdash;politically for your country's
sake, personally because I shall offer you and give you
happiness and a position you could never find elsewhere."</p>

<p>For a moment her eyes seemed to be looking through him, as
though some vision of things outside the room were troubling
her. Her finger had already touched the bell and a servant was
standing upon the threshold.</p>

<p>"We shall meet in Washington," Mr. Fischer concluded, with an
air of a prophet, as he took his leave.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p class="first">IT was within half an hour of closing time that
same afternoon when Lutchester walked into James Van Teyl's
office. The young man greeted him with some surprise.</p>

<p>"Will you do some business for me?" Lutchester asked, without
any preliminaries.</p>

<p>"Sure!"</p>

<p>"How many Anglo-French will you buy for me? I can obtain
credit by cable to-morrow through any bank for twenty or thirty
thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"You want to buy Anglo-French?" Van Teyl repeated softly.</p>

<p>His visitor nodded.</p>

<p>"Any news?"</p>

<p>Lutchester hesitated, and Van Teyl continued with an
apologetic gesture.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. That's not my job, anyway, to ask
questions. I'll buy you twenty-five thousand, if you like. Guess
they can't drop much lower."</p>

<p>Lutchester sat down.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, "I will wait."</p>

<p>A little ripple of excitement went through the office as Van
Teyl started his negotiations. It seemed to Lutchester that
several telephones and half a dozen perspiring young men were
called into his service. In the end Van Teyl made out a note and
handed it to him.</p>

<p>"I could have done better for you yesterday," he observed.
"The market is strengthening all the time. There are probably
some rumours."</p>

<p>A boy went by along the pavement outside waving a handful of
papers. His cry floated in through the open window:</p>

<br>

<p class="headline">REPORTED LOSS OF MANY MORE GERMAN
BATTLESHIPS. BRITISH CLAIM VICTORY.</p>

<hr>

<p>Van Teyl grinned.</p>

<p>"You got here just in time," he murmured, "but I suppose you
knew all about this."</p>

<p>"I have known since three o'clock," Lutchester replied, "that
all the reports of a German victory were false. You will find,
when the truth is known, that the German losses were greater
than the British."</p>

<p>"Then if that's so," Van Teyl remarked, "I've got one client
who'll lose a hatful which you ought to make. Coming up
town?"</p>

<p>"I should like, if I may?" Lutchester said, "to be permitted
to pay my respects to your sister."</p>

<p>"Why, that's fine!" Van Teyl exclaimed unconvincingly. "We'll
take the subway up."</p>

<p>They left the office and plunged into the indescribable
horrors of their journey. When they stepped out into the sunlit
street in another atmosphere, Van Teyl laid his hand upon his
companion's arm in friendly fashion.</p>

<p>"Say, Lutchester," he began, "I don't know that you are going
to find Pamela exactly all that she might be in the way of
amiability and so on. I know these things are done on the other
side, but here it's considered trying your friends pretty high
to take a lady of Sonia's reputation where you are likely to
meet your friends. No offence, eh?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," Lutchester replied. "I was sorry, of course,
to see you last night. On the other hand, Sonia is an old
friend, and my dinner with her had an object. I think I could
explain it to your sister."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I should try," Van Teyl advised. "For all
her cosmopolitanism, Pamela has some quaint ideas. However, I
thought I'd warn you, in case she's a bit awkward."</p>

<p>Pamela, however, had no idea of being awkward. She welcomed
Lutchester with a very sweet smile, and gave him the tips of her
fingers.</p>

<p>"I was wondering whether we should see you again before we
went," she said. "We are leaving for Washington to-morrow."</p>

<p>"By the three o'clock train, I hope?" he ventured.</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Why, are you going, too?"</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>"I should have thought most of the munition works," she
observed, "were further north."</p>

<p>"They are," he acknowledged, "but I have business in
Washington. By the bye, will you both come out and dine with me
to-night?"</p>

<p>Van Teyl glanced at his sister. She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry," she said, "but we are engaged. Perhaps we
shall see something of you in Washington."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt you will," Lutchester replied "All the
same," he added, "it would give me very great pleasure to
entertain you at dinner this evening."</p>

<p>"Why particularly this evening?" she asked.</p>

<p>He looked at her with a queer directness, and Pamela felt
certain very excellent resolutions crumbling. She suffered her
brother to leave the room without a word.</p>

<p>"Because," he explained, "I think you will find a different
atmosphere everywhere. There will be news in the evening
papers."</p>

<p>"News?" she repeated eagerly. "You know I am always
interested in that."</p>

<p>"The reports of a German naval victory were not only
exaggerated," Lutchester said calmly; "they were untrue. Our own
official announcement was clumsy and tactless, but you will find
it amplified and explained to-night."</p>

<p>Pamela listened with an interest which bordered upon
excitement.</p>

<p>"You are sure?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Absolutely," he replied. "My notification is official."</p>

<p>"So you think if we dined with you, the atmosphere to-night
would be different?" she observed, with a sudden attempt at the
recondite.</p>

<p>Lutchester looked into her eyes without flinching. Pamela, to
her annoyance, was worsted in the momentary duel.</p>

<p>"We cannot always choose our atmosphere," he reminded
her.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Sonia is perhaps connected with the regulation
of the munition supplies from America?"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Sonia," Lutchester asserted, "is an old friend
of mine. Apart from that, it was my business to talk to
her."</p>

<p>"Your business?"</p>

<p>Lutchester assented with perfect gravity.</p>

<p>"Within a day or two," he said, "now, if you made a point of
it, I could explain a great deal."</p>

<p>Pamela threw herself into a chair almost irritably.</p>

<p>"You have the cult of being mysterious, Mr. Lutchester," she
declared. "To be quite frank with you, you seem to be the
queerest mixture of any man I ever knew."</p>

<p>"It is the fault of circumstances," he regretted, "if I am
sometimes compelled to present myself to you in an unfavourable
light. Those circumstances are passing. You will soon begin to
value me at my true worth."</p>

<p>"We had half promised," Pamela murmured, "to go out with Mr.
Fischer this evening."</p>

<p>"The more reason for my intervention," Lutchester observed.
"Fischer is not a fit person for you to associate with."</p>

<p>She laughed curiously.</p>

<p>"People who saw you at the roof-garden last night might say
that you were scarcely a judge," Pamela retorted.</p>

<p>"People who did not know the circumstances might have
considered me guilty of an indiscretion," Lutchester admitted,
"but they would have been entirely wrong. On the other hand,
your friend Fischer is a would-be murderer, a liar, and is at
the present moment engaged in intrigues which are a most immoral
compound of duplicity and cunning."</p>

<p>"I shall begin to think," Pamela murmured, "that you don't
like Mr. Fischer!"</p>

<p>"I detest him heartily," Lutchester confessed.</p>

<p>"I find him singularly interesting," Pamela announced,
sitting up in her chair.</p>

<p>"I dare say you do," Lutchester replied. "Women are always
bad judges of our sex. All the same, you are not going to marry
him."</p>

<p>"How do you know he wants to marry me?" Pamela demanded.</p>

<p>"Instinct!"</p>

<p>"And what do you mean by saying that I am not going to marry
him?"</p>

<p>"Because," Lutchester announced, "you are going to marry some
one else."</p>

<p>Pamela rose to her feet. There was a little spot of colour in
her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Am I indeed!" she exclaimed. "And whom, pray?"</p>

<p>"That I will tell you at Washington," Lutchester
promised.</p>

<p>"You know his name, then?"</p>

<p>"I know him intimately," was the cool reply. "What about our
dinner to-night?"</p>

<p>"We are going to dine with Mr. Fischer," Pamela decided.</p>

<p>"I really don't think so," Lutchester objected. "For one
thing, Mr. Fischer will probably have to attend the police court
again later on."</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"For having hired a famous murderer to try and get rid of
me." Lutchester explained suavely.</p>

<p>"Do you really believe that?" Pamela scoffed. "Why should he
want to get rid of you? What harm can you do him?"</p>

<p>"I am trying to find out," Lutchester replied grimly. "Still,
since you ask the question, the pocketbook which is on its way
to Germany, and which I picked up when Nikasti was taken
ill&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know about that!" Pamela interrupted. "That is
the one thing that always sets me thinking about you. What did
you do it for? How did you know what it meant to me?"</p>

<p>"Divination, I imagine," Lutchester answered, "or perhaps I
was thinking what it might mean to Mr. Fischer."</p>

<p>She looked at him and her face was a study in mixed
expressions. Her forehead was a little knitted, her eyes almost
strained in their desire to read him; her lips were
petulant.</p>

<p>"Dear me, what a puzzle you are!" she exclaimed. "All the
same, I am going to wait for Mr. Fischer. It doesn't matter
whether one dines or sups. I suppose he will get away from the
police court sometime or other."</p>

<p>"But anyway," he protested, "you've heard all that Mr.
Fischer has to say. Now I, on the other hand, haven't shown you
my hand yet."</p>

<p>"Heard all that Mr. Fischer has to say?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"Certainly! Wasn't he here for several hours with you this
afternoon? Didn't he promise you an alliance with Germany
against Japan, if you could persuade certain people at
Washington to change their tone and attitude towards the export
of munitions?"</p>

<p>"This," she declared, trying to keep a certain agitation from
her tone, "is mere bluff."</p>

<p>Lutchester was suddenly very serious indeed.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said, "I can prove to you, if you will, that it
is not bluff. I can prove to you that I really know something of
what I am talking about."</p>

<p>"There is nothing I should like better," she declared.</p>

<p>"To begin with then," Lutchester said, "the pocketbook which
Nikasti is supposed to have stolen from your room, the
pocketbook of young Sandy Graham, which Mr. Fischer has sent to
Germany, does not contain the formula of the new explosive, or
any other formula that amounts to anything."</p>

<p>"Just how do you know that?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"To continue," Lutchester said, playing with a little
ornament upon the mantelpiece, "you have an
appointment&mdash;within half an hour, I believe&mdash;with Mr.
Paul Haskall, who is a specialist in explosives, having an
official position with the American Government."</p>

<p>She had ceased to struggle any longer with her surprise. She
looked at him fixedly but remained silent.</p>

<p>"It is your belief," he proceeded, "that you are going to
hand over to him the formula of which we were speaking."</p>

<p>"It is no belief," she replied. "It is certainty. I took it
myself from Graham's pocket."</p>

<p>Lutchester nodded.</p>

<p>"Good! Have you opened it?"</p>

<p>"I have," she declared. "It is without doubt, the
formula."</p>

<p>"On the other hand, I am here to assure you that it is not,"
Lutchester replied.</p>

<p>Her hand was tearing at the cushion by her side. She
moistened her lips. There was something about Lutchester
hatefully convincing.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she demanded. "Is this a trick. You won't
get it! No one but Mr. Haskall will get that formula from
me!"</p>

<p>Lutchester smiled.</p>

<p>"It will only puzzle him when he gets it! To tell you the
truth, the formula is rubbish."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you," she said firmly. "If you think you are
going to interfere with my handing it over to him, you are
mistaken."</p>

<p>"I have no wish to do anything of the sort," Lutchester
assured her. "Make a bargain with me. Mr. Haskall will be here
soon. Unfasten the little package you are carrying somewhere
about your person, hand him the envelope and watch his face. If
he tells you that what you have offered him is a coherent and
possible formula for an explosive, then you can look upon me for
ever afterwards as the poor, foolish person you sometimes seem
to consider me. If, on the other hand, he tells you that it is
rubbish, I shall expect you at the Ritz-Carlton at half-past
eight."</p>

<p>There was a ring at the bell. She rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"I accept," she declared. "That is Mr. Haskall. And, by the
bye, Mr. Lutchester, don't order too elaborate a dinner, for I
am very much afraid you will have to eat it all yourself. Now,
<i>au revoir</i>," she added, as the door was opened in obedience to her summons and a servant stood prepared to show him out. "If we don't turn up to-night, you will know the reason."</p>

<p>"I am very hopeful," Lutchester replied, as he turned
away.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p class="first">AT five-and-twenty minutes past eight that
evening Lutchester, who was waiting in the entrance hall of the
Ritz-Carlton, became just a little restless. At half-past, his
absorption in an evening paper, over the top of which he looked
at every newcomer, was almost farcical. At five-and-twenty to
nine Pamela arrived. He advanced down the lounge to meet her.
Her face was inscrutable, her smile conventional. Yet she had
come! He looked over his shoulder towards the men's coat
room.</p>

<p>"Your brother?"</p>

<p>"I sent Jim to his club," she said. "I want to have a
confidential talk with you, Mr. Lutchester."</p>

<p>"I am very flattered," he told her, with real
earnestness.</p>

<p>She vanished for a few moments in the cloakroom, and
reappeared, a radiant vision in deep blue silk. Her hair was
gathered in a coil at the top of her head, and surmounted with
an ornament of pearls.</p>

<p>"You are looking at my headdress," she remarked, as they
walked into the room. "It is the style you admire, is it
not?"</p>

<p>He murmured something vague, but he knew that he was
forgiven. They were ushered to their places by a portly
<i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, and she approved of his table. It was set almost in an alcove, and was partially hidden from the other diners.</p>

<p>"Is this seclusion vanity or flattery?"</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, it is rather a popular table," he told
her. "We have an excellent view of the room, and yet one can
talk here without being disturbed."</p>

<p>"To talk to you is exactly what I wish to do," she said, as
they took their places. "We commence, if you please, with a
question. Mr. Fischer thought that he had that formula and he
hasn't. I could have sworn that it was in my possession&mdash;and it
isn't. Where is it?"</p>

<p>"I took it to the War Office before I left England," he told
her simply. "They will have the first few tons of the stuff
ready next month."</p>

<p>"You!" she cried, "But where did you get it?"</p>

<p>"I happened to be first, that's all," he explained. "You see,
I had the advantage of a little inside information. I could have
exposed the whole affair if I had thought it wise. I preferred,
however, to let matters take their course. Young Graham deserved
all he got there, and I made sure of being the first to go
through his papers. I'm afraid I must confess that I left a
bogus formula for you."</p>

<p>"I had begun to suspect this," Pamela confessed. "You don't
mind being put into the witness box, do you?" she added, as she
pushed aside the menu with a little sigh of satisfaction. "How
wonderfully you order an American dinner!"</p>

<p>"I am so glad I have chosen what you like," he said, "and as
to being in the witness box&mdash;well, I am going to place myself in
the confessional, and that is very much the same thing, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"To begin at the beginning, then&mdash;about that destroyer?"</p>

<p>"My mission over here was really important," he admitted. "I
couldn't catch the <i>Lapland</i>, so the Admiralty sent me
over."</p>

<p>"And your golf with Senator Hamblin? It wasn't altogether by
accident you met him down at Baltusrol, was it?"</p>

<p>"It was not," he confessed, "I had reason to suspect that
certain proposals from Berlin were to be put forward to the
President either through his or Senator Hastings' mediation.
There were certain facts in connection with them, which I
desired to be the first to lay before the authorities."</p>

<p>She looked around the room and recognised some of her
friends. For some reason or other she felt remarkably
light-hearted.</p>

<p>"For a poor vanquished woman," she observed, turning back to
Lutchester, "I feel extraordinarily gay to-night. Tell me some
more."</p>

<p>He bowed.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Sonia," he proceeded, "has been a friend of
mine since she sang in the cafes of Buda Pesth. I dined with
her, however, because it had come to my knowledge that she was
behaving in a very foolish manner."</p>

<p>Pamela nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>"She was the friend of Count Maurice Ziduski, wasn't
she?"</p>

<p>"She is no longer," Lutchester replied. "She sailed for
France this morning without seeing him. She has remembered that
she is a Frenchwoman."</p>

<p>"It was you who reminded her!"</p>

<p>"Love so easily makes people forgetful," he said, "and I
think that Sonia was very fond of Maurice Ziduski. She is a
thoughtless, passionate woman, easily swayed through her
affections, and she had no idea of the evil she was doing."</p>

<p>"So that disposes of Sonia," Pamela reflected.</p>

<p>"Sonia was only an interlude," Lutchester declared. "She
really doesn't come into this affair at all. The one person who
does come into it, whom you and I must speak of, is
Fischer."</p>

<p>"A most interesting man," Pamela sighed. "I really think his
wife would have a most exciting life."</p>

<p>"She would!" Lutchester agreed. "She'd probably be allowed to
visit him once every fourteen days in care of a warder."</p>

<p>"Spite!" Pamela exclaimed, with a suspicious little quiver at
the corner of her lips.</p>

<p>Lutchester shook his head.</p>

<p>"Fischer is too near the end of his rope for me to feel
spiteful," he said, "though I am quite prepared to grant that he
may be capable of considerable mischief yet. A man who has the
sublime effrontery to attempt to come to an agreement with two
countries, each behind the other's back, is a little more than
Machiavellian, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Is that true of Mr. Fischer?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely," Lutchester assured her. "He is over here for
the purpose of somehow or other making it known informally in
Washington that Germany would be willing to pledge herself to an
alliance with America against Japan, after the war, if America
will alter her views as to the export of munitions to the
Allies."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a reasonable proposition, isn't it, from his
point of view?" Pamela remarked. "It may not be a very agreeable
one from yours, but it is certainly one which he has a right to
make."</p>

<p>"Entirely," Lutchester agreed, "but where he goes wrong is
that his primary object in coming here was to meet Hie chief of
the Japanese Secret Service, to whom he has made a proposition
of precisely similar character."</p>

<p>Pamela set down her glass.</p>

<p>"You are not in earnest!"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>"Nikasti?"</p>

<p>"Precisely! He came all the way from Japan to confer with
Fischer. Probably, if we knew the whole truth, those rooms at
the Plaza Hotel, and the social partnership of your brother and
Fischer, were arranged for no other reason than to provide a
safe personality for Nikasti in this country, and a safe place
for him to talk things over with Fischer."</p>

<p>"Mr. Fischer was paying nearly the whole of the expenses of
the Plaza suite," Pamela observed thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Naturally," Lutchester replied. "Your brother's name was a
good, safe name to get behind. But to conclude with our friend
Nikasti. He is supposed to leave New York next Saturday, and to
carry to the Emperor of Japan an autograph letter from a
nameless person, promising him, if Japan will cease the export
of munitions to Russia, the aid of Germany in her impending
campaign against America."</p>

<p>"An autograph letter, did you say?" Pamela almost gasped.</p>

<p>"An autograph letter," Lutchester repeated firmly. "Now don't
you agree with me that Fischer's game is just a little too
daring?"</p>

<p>"It is preposterous!" she cried.</p>

<p>"I have a theory," Lutchester continued, "that Fischer was
never intended to use more than one of these letters. It was
intended that he should study the situation here, approach one
side, and, if unsuccessful, try the other. Fischer, however,
conceived a more magnificent idea. He seems to be trying both at
the same time. It is the sublime egotism of the Teutonic
mind."</p>

<p>"It is monstrous!" Pamela exclaimed indignantly.</p>

<p>"It is almost as monstrous," Lutchester agreed, "as his
daring to raise his eyes to you, although, so far as you are
concerned, I believe that he is as honest as the man knows how
to be."</p>

<p>"And why," she asked, "do you credit him with so much good
faith?"</p>

<p>"Because," Lutchester replied, "if he had not been actuated
by personal motives, he would never have sought you out as an
intermediary. There are other sources open to him, by means of
which he could make equally sure of reaching the President's
ear. His idea was to impress you. It was foolish but
natural."</p>

<p>Pamela was deep in thought. There was an angry spot of colour
burning in her cheek.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me, Mr. Lutchester," she persisted,
"that this afternoon, say, when with every appearance of
earnestness he was begging me to put these propositions before
my uncle, he had really made precisely similar overtures to
Japan?"</p>

<p>"I give you my word that this is the truth," Lutchester
assured her solemnly.</p>

<p>She looked at him with something almost like wonder in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"But you?" she exclaimed. "How do you know this? How can you
be sure of it?"</p>

<p>"I have seen the autograph letter which Nikasti has in his
possession," he announced.</p>

<p>"You mean that Mr. Fischer showed it to you?" she exclaimed
incredulously.</p>

<p>Lutchester hesitated.</p>

<p>"There are methods," he said, "which those who fight in the
dark places for their country are forced sometimes to make use
of. I have seen the letter. I have half convinced those who
represent Japan in this matter of Fischer's duplicity. With your
help I am hoping wholly to do so."</p>

<p>Pamela leaned for a moment back in her chair.</p>

<p>"Really," she declared, "I am beginning to have the feeling
that I am living almost too rapidly. Let us have a breathing
spell. I wonder what all these other people are talking
about."</p>

<p>"Probably," he suggested, with a little glance around, "about
themselves. We will follow their example. Will you marry me,
please, Miss Van Teyl?"</p>

<p>"We haven't even come to the ice yet," she sighed, "and you
pass from high politics to flagrant personalities. Are you a
sensationalist, Mr. Lutchester?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," he protested. "I simply asked you an
extremely important question quite calmly."</p>

<p>"It isn't a question that should be asked calmly," she
objected.</p>

<p>"I have immense self-control," he told her, "but if you'd
like me to abandon it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, no!" she interrupted. "Tell me more about
Mr. Fischer."</p>

<p>"You won't forget to answer my little question later on, will
you?" he begged. "To proceed, then. I spent some little time
this afternoon with your chief of the police here, and I fancy
that the person you speak of is becoming a little too blatant
even for a broad-minded country like this. He belongs to an
informal company of wealthy sympathisers with Germany, who
propose to start a campaign of destruction at all the factories
manufacturing munitions for the Allies. They have put aside&mdash;I
believe it is several million dollars, for purposes of bribery.
They don't seem to realise, as my friend pointed out to me this
afternoon, that the days for this sort of thing in New York have
passed. Some of them will be in prison before they know where
they are."</p>

<p>"Exactly why did you come to America?" she asked, a little
abruptly.</p>

<p>"To meet Nikasti and to look after Fischer."</p>

<p>"Well, you seem to have done that pretty effectually!"</p>

<p>"Also," he went on calmly, "to keep an eye upon you."</p>

<p>"Professionally?"</p>

<p>"You ask me to give away too many secrets," he whispered,
leaning towards her.</p>

<p>She made a little grimace.</p>

<p>"Tell me some more about your little adventure in Fifth
Avenue?" she begged.</p>

<p>He smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't believe me," he reminded her, "but it really
was one of Fischer's little jokes. It very nearly came off, too.
As a matter of fact," he went on, "Fischer isn't really clever.
He is too obstinate, too convinced in his own mind that things
must go the way he wants them to, that Fate is the servant of
his will. It's a sort of national trait, you know, very much
like the way we English bury our heads in the sand when we hear
unpleasant truths. The last thing Fischer wants is
advertisement, and yet he goes to some of his Fourteenth Street
friends and unearths a popular desperado to get rid of me. The
fellow happens most unexpectedly to fail, and now Fischer has to
face a good many awkward questions and a good deal of notoriety.
No, I don't think Fischer is really clever."</p>

<p>Pamela sighed.</p>

<p>"In that case, I suppose I shall have to say 'No' to him,"
she decided. "After waiting all this time, I couldn't bear to be
married to a fool."</p>

<p>"You won't be," he assured her cheerfully.</p>

<p>"More British arrogance," she murmured. "Now see what's going
to happen to us!"</p>

<p>A tall, elderly man, with smooth white hair plastered over
his forehead, very precisely dressed, and with a gait so careful
as to be almost mincing, was approaching their table. Pamela
held out her hands.</p>

<p>"My dear uncle!" she exclaimed. "And I thought that you and
aunt never dined at restaurants!"</p>

<p>Mr. Hastings stood with his fingers resting lightly upon the
table. He glanced at Lutchester without apparent
recognition.</p>

<p>"You remember Mr. Lutchester?" Pamela murmured.</p>

<p>Mr. Hastings' manner lacked the true American cordiality, but
he hastened to extend his hand.</p>

<p>"Of course!" he declared. "I was not fortunate enough,
however, to see much of you the other evening, Mr. Lutchester.
We have several mutual friends whom I should be glad to hear
about."</p>

<p>"I shall pay my respects to Mrs. Hastings, if I may, very
shortly," Lutchester promised.</p>

<p>"Are you with friends here, uncle?" Pamela inquired.</p>

<p>"We are the guests of Mr. Oscar Fischer," the Senator
announced.</p>

<p>Pamela raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"So you know Mr. Fischer, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Naturally," Mr. Hastings replied, with some dignity. "Oscar
Fischer is one of the most important men in the State which I
represent. He is a man of great wealth and industry and immense
influence."</p>

<p>Pamela made a little grimace. Her uncle noticed it and
frowned.</p>

<p>"He has just been telling us of his voyage with you, Pamela.
Perhaps, if Mr. Lutchester can spare you," he went on, with a
little bow across the table, "you will come and take your coffee
with us. Your aunt is leaving for Washington, probably
to-morrow, and wishes to arrange for you to travel with her. Mr.
Lutchester may also, perhaps, give us the pleasure of his
company for a few minutes," he added, after a slight but obvious
pause.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Pamela answered quickly, "I am Mr. Lutchester's
guest this evening. If you are still here, I shall love to come
and speak to aunt for a moment later on. If not, I will ring up
to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>The bland, almost episcopal serenity of Senator Hastings'
face was somewhat disturbed. It was obvious that the situation
displeased him.</p>

<p>"I think, Pamela," he said, "that you had better come and
speak to your aunt before you leave."</p>

<p>His bow to Lutchester was the bow of a politician to an
adversary. He made his way back in leisurely fashion to the
table from which he had come, exchanging a few words with many
acquaintances. Pamela watched him with a twinkle in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"I am becoming so unpopular," she murmured. "I can read in my
uncle's tone that my aunt and he disapprove of our dining
together here. And as for Mr. Fischer. I'm afraid he'll break
off our prospective alliance."</p>

<p>Lutchester smiled.</p>

<p>"Prospective is the only word to use," he observed. "By the
bye, are you particularly fond of your uncle?"</p>

<p>"Not riotously," she admitted. "He has been kind to me once
or twice, but he's rather a starchy old person."</p>

<p>"In that case," Lutchester decided, "we won't interfere."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch30"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p class="first">FISCHER had by no means the appearance of a
discomfited man that evening, when some time later Pamela and
Lutchester approached the little group of which he seemed,
somehow, to have become the central figure. It was a small
party, but, in its way, a distinguished one. Pamela's aunt was a
member of an historic American family, and a woman of great
social position, not only in New York but in Washington itself.
Of the remaining guests, one was a financial magnate of
world-wide fame, and the other, Senator Joyce, a politician of such eminence that his name was freely mentioned as a possible future president. Mrs. Hastings greeted Pamela and her escort without enthusiasm.</p>

Mrs. Hastings greeted Pamela and her escort without enthusiasm.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>"My dear child," she exclaimed, "how extraordinary to find
you here!"</p>

<p>"Is it?" Pamela observed indifferently. "You know Mr.
Lutchester, don't you, aunt?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Hastings remembered her late dinner guest, but her
recognition was icy and barely polite. She turned away at once
and resumed her conversation with Fischer. Lutchester was not
introduced to either of the other members of the party. He laid
his hand on the back of an empty chair and turned it round for
Pamela, but she stopped him with a word of thanks. Something had
gone from her own naturally pleasant tone. She held her hand
higher, even, than her aunt's, as she turned a little
insistently towards her.</p>

<p>"So sorry, aunt," she announced, "but we are going now. Good
night!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Hastings disapproved.</p>

<p>"We have seen nothing of you yet, Pamela," she said stiffly.
"You had better stay with us and we will drop you on our way
home."</p>

<p>Pamela shook her head.</p>

<p>"I am coming with you to-morrow, you know," she reminded her
aunt. "To-night I am Mr. Lutchester's guest and he will see me
home."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hastings drew her niece a little closer to her.</p>

<p>"Is this part of your European manners, Pamela?" she
whispered, "that you dine alone in a restaurant with an
acquaintance? Let me tell you frankly that I dislike the idea
most heartily. My chaperonage is always at your service, and any
girl of your age in America would be delighted to avail herself
of it."</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you, aunt," Pamela replied, "but in a
general way I finished with chaperones long ago."</p>

<p>"Where is Jimmy?" Mrs. Hastings inquired.</p>

<p>"He was coming with us to-night," Pamela explained, "but I
asked him particularly to stay away. I have seen so little of
Mr. Lutchester since he arrived, and I want to talk to him."</p>

<p>The financial magnate awoke from a comatose inertia and
suddenly gripped Lutchester by the hand.</p>

<p>"Lutchester," he repeated to himself. "I thought I knew your
face. Stayed with your uncle down at Monte Carlo once. You came
there for a week."</p>

<p>Lutchester acknowledged his recollection of the fact and the
two men exchanged a few commonplace remarks. Mrs. Hastings took
the opportunity to try and induce Pamela to converse with
Fischer.</p>

<p>"We have all been so interested to-night," she said, "in
hearing what Mr. Fischer has to say about the situation on the
other side."</p>

<p>Pamela was primed for combat.</p>

<p>"Has Mr. Fischer been telling you fairy tales?" she
laughed.</p>

<p>"Fairy tales?" her aunt repeated severely. "I don't
understand."</p>

<p>Fischer's steel grey eyes flashed behind his spectacles.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that Miss Van Teyl's prejudices," he observed
bitterly, "are very firmly fixed."</p>

<p>"Then she is no true American," Mrs. Hastings pronounced
didactically.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can assure you that I am not prejudiced," Pamela
declared, "only, you see, I, too, have just arrived from the
other side, and I have been able to use my own eyes and
judgment. If there is any prejudice in the matter, why should it
not come from Mr. Fischer? He has the very good excuse of his
German birth."</p>

<p>"Mr. Fischer is an American citizen," Mrs. Hastings reminded
her niece, "and personally, I think that the American of German
birth is one of the most loyal and long-suffering persons I
know. I cannot say as much for the English people who are living
over here. And as to fairy stories&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pamela intervened, turning towards Fischer with a little
laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, he can't even deny those! What about the great German
victory in the North Sea, Mr. Fischer? Do you happen to have
seen the latest telegrams?"</p>

<p>"Our first reports were perhaps a little too glowing," Mr.
Fischer acknowledged. "That, under the circumstances, is, I
think, only natural. But the facts remain that the invincible
English and the untried German fleets have met, to the advantage
of the German."</p>

<p>Pamela shook her head.</p>

<p>"I cannot even allow that," she objected. "The advantage, if
there was any, rested on the other side. But I just want you to
remember what we were told in that first wonderful outpouring of
fabricated news&mdash;that the naval supremacy of England was gone
for ever, that the freedom of the seas was assured, that German
merchant vessels were steaming home from all directions! No, Mr.
Fischer! Between ourselves, I think that your cause needs a few
fairy stories, and I look upon you as one of the greatest
experts in the world when it comes to concocting them."</p>

<p>Fischer, who had risen to his feet half way through Pamela's
speech, was obviously a little taken aback by her direct attack.
Mrs. Hastings took no pains to conceal her annoyance.</p>

<p>"For a young girl of your age, Pamela," she said sternly, "I
consider that you express your opinions far too freely. Your
attitude, too, is unjustifiable."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, you see, I am a little prejudiced against Mr.
Fischer," Pamela laughed, turning towards him. "He happened to
defeat one of my pet schemes."</p>

<p>"But I am ready to further your dearest one," he reminded
her, dropping his voice, and leading her a little on one side.
"What about our alliance?"</p>

<p>"You scarcely need my aid," she observed, with a shrug of the
shoulders.</p>

<p>He remonstrated vigorously. There was a revived hopefulness
in his tone. Perhaps, after all, here was the secret of her
displeasure with him.</p>

<p>"You wonder, perhaps, to see me with your uncle. I give you
my word that it is a dinner of courtesy only. I give you my word
that I have not opened my lips on political matters. I have been
waiting for your answer."</p>

<p>"I have lost faith in you," she told him calmly. "I am not
even certain that you possess the authority you spoke of."</p>

<p>"If that is all," he replied eagerly, "you shall see it with
your own eyes. You are staying with your uncle and aunt in
Washington, are you not? I shall call upon you immediately I
arrive, and bring it with me."</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, that remains a challenge, then, Mr. Fischer. And now,
if you are quite ready," she added, turning to Lutchester....
"Good-by, everybody!"</p>

<p>"Aren't your ears burning?" Pamela asked, after Lutchester
had handed her into a taxicab and taken his place by her side.
"I can absolutely feel them talking about us."</p>

<br>

<a id="pic12"></a>

<p class="caption">"Aren't your ears burning?"</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>"I seem to be most regrettably unpopular," Lutchester
remarked.</p>

<p>"Even now I am puzzled about that," Pamela confessed, "but
you see my aunt considers herself the arbitress of what is right
or wrong in social matters, and she is exceedingly
narrow-minded. In her eyes it is no doubt a greater misdemeanour for me to have dined at the Ritz-Carlton alone with you, than if I had conspired against the Government."</p>

<p>"And this, I thought, was the land of freedom for your
sex!"</p>

<p>"Ah, but my aunt is rather an exception," Pamela reminded
him. "The one thing I cannot understand, however, is that she
should have allowed herself to be seen dining with Mr. Oscar
Fischer at the Ritz-Carlton. I should have thought that would
have been almost as heinous to her as my own little slip from
grace."</p>

<p>"Is your aunt by way of being interested in politics?"
Lutchester inquired.</p>

<p>"Not in a general way," Pamela replied, "but she is intensely
ambitious, and she'd give her soul if Uncle Theodore could get a
nomination for the Presidency."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she is taking up the German-American cause, then,"
Lutchester suggested. "It is a possible platform, at any
rate."</p>

<p>"I foresee a new party," Pamela murmured thoughtfully. "Now I
come to think of it, Mr. Elsworthy, the fat old gentleman who
knew your uncle, is very pro-German."</p>

<p>He leaned towards her.</p>

<p>"We have had enough politics," he insisted. "There is the
other thing. Couldn't I have my answer?"</p>

<p>She let him take her fingers. In the cool darkness through
which they were rushing her face seemed white, her head was a
little averted. He tried to draw her to him, but she was
unyielding.</p>

<p>"Please not," she begged. "I like you&mdash;and I'm glad I like
you," she added, "but I don't feel certain about anything.
Couldn't we be just friends a little longer?"</p>

<p>"It must be as you say, but I am horribly in love with you,"
he confessed. "That may sound rather a bald way of saying so,
but it's the truth, Pamela, dear."</p>

<p>His clasp upon her fingers was tightened. She turned towards
him. Her expression was serious but delightful.</p>

<p>"Well, let me tell you this much, at least," she confided. "I
have never before in my life been so glad to hear any one say
so.... And here we are at home, and there's Jimmy on the
doorstep. What is it, Jimmy," she asked, waving her hand.</p>

<p>He came down towards her in a state of great excitement.</p>

<p>"Say, we've had to open up the office again!" he exclaimed.
"The telegrams are rolling in now. That so-called German naval
victory was a fake. The Britishers came out right on top. You
know you stand to net at least half a million, Mr. Lutchester?
The worst of it is I have another client who's going to lose
it."</p>

<p>Pamela shook her head at Lutchester.</p>

<p>"The possibility of increased responsibilities," he
whispered. "A married man needs something to fall back
upon."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch31"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<p class="first">THE offices of Messrs. Neville, Brooks, and Van
Teyl were the scene of something like pandemonium. Van Teyl
himself, bathed in perspiration, rushed into his room for the
twentieth time. He almost flung the newspaper man who was
waiting for him through the door.</p>

<p>"No, we don't know a darned thing," he declared. "We've no
special information. The only reason we're up to our neck in
Anglo-French is because we've two big clients dealing."</p>

<p>"It's just a few personal notes about those clients we'd like
to handle."</p>

<p>"Oh, get out as quick as you can!" Van Teyl snapped. "This
isn't a bucket shop or a pool room. The names of our clients
concerns ourselves only."</p>

<p>"What do you think Anglo-French are going to do, Mr. Van
Teyl?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell," was the prompt answer, "but I can tell what's
going to happen if you don't clear out."</p>

<p>The newspaper man took a hurried leave. Van Teyl seized the
telephone receiver, only to put it down with a little shout of
relief as the door opened and Lutchester entered.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" he exclaimed. "Why, I've been ringing you up for
an hour and a half."</p>

<p>"Sorry," Lutchester replied, "I was down at the barber's the
first time you got through, and then I had some cables to send
off."</p>

<p>"Look here," Van Teyl continued, gripping him by the
shoulder, "is six hundred and forty thousand dollars, or
thereabouts, profit enough for you on your Anglo-French?"</p>

<p>"It sounds adequate," Lutchester confessed, laying his hat
and cane carefully upon the table and drawing up an easy-chair.
"How much is Mr. Fischer going to lose?"</p>

<p>"God knows! If you allow me to sell at the present moment,
you'll ease the market, and he'll lose about what you make."</p>

<p>"And if I decide to hold my Anglo-French?"</p>

<p>"You'll have to provide us with about a couple of million
dollars," Van Teyl replied, "and I should think you would pretty
well break Fischer for a time. Frankly, he's an important
client, and we don't want him broken, even temporarily."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do, then?"</p>

<p>"Give us authority to sell," Van Teyl begged. "Can't you hear
them yapping about in the office outside? They're round me all
the time like a pack of hounds. Honestly, if I don't sell some
Anglo-French before lunch-time to-day, they look like wrecking
the office."</p>

<p>Lutchester knocked the end of a cigarette thoughtfully
against the side of his chair.</p>

<p>"All right," he decided, "I don't want you to suffer any
inconvenience. Besides, I am going to Washington this afternoon.
You can keep on selling as long as the market's steady. Directly
it sags, hold off. If necessary, even buy a few more. You
understand me? Don't sell a single block under to-day's price.
Keep the market at that figure. It's an easy job, because next
week Anglo-French will go up again."</p>

<p>Van Teyl was moved to a rare flash of admiration.</p>

<p>"You're a cool hand, Lutchester," he declared, "considering
you're not a business man."</p>

<p>"Fischer's the man who'll need to keep cool," Lutchester
remarked, lighting his cigarette. "What about a little
lunch?"</p>

<p>The stockbroker scarcely heard him. He had struck a bell, and
the office seemed suddenly filled with clerks. Van Teyl's words
were incoherent&mdash;a string of strange directions, punctuated
by slang which was, so far as Lutchester was concerned,
unintelligible. The whole place seemed to wake into a clamour of
telephone bells, shouts, the clanging and opening of the lift
gates, and the hurried tramp of footsteps in the corridors
outside. Lutchester rose to his feet. He was looking very
comfortable and matter-of-fact in his grey tweed suit and soft
felt hat.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he observed pleasantly, "I am out of place here.
Drop me a line and let me know how things are going to the Hotel
Capitol at Washington."</p>

<p>"That's all right," Van Teyl promised. "I'll get you on the
long-distance 'phone. I was coming myself with Pamela for a few
days, but this little deal of yours has set things buzzing....
Say, who's that?"</p>

<p>The door opened, and Fischer paused upon the threshold.
Certainly, of all the people concerned, the two speculators
themselves seemed the least moved by the excitement they were
causing. Fischer was dressed with his usual spick-and-span
neatness, and his appearance betrayed no sign of flurry or
excitement. He nodded grimly to Lutchester.</p>

<p>"My congratulations," he said. "You seem to have rigged the
Press here to some purpose."</p>

<p>Lutchester raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"I don't even know a newspaper man in New York," he
declared.</p>

<p>The newcomer gave vent to a little gesture of derision.</p>

<p>"Then you've some very clever friends! You'd better make the
most of their offices. The German version of the naval battle
will be confirmed and amplified within twenty-four hours, and
then your Anglo-French will touch mud."</p>

<p>"If that is your idea," Lutchester remarked suavely, "why buy
now? Why not wait till next week? Come," he went on, "I will
have a little flutter with you, if you like, Fischer. I will bet
you five thousand dollars, and Van Teyl here shall hold the
stakes, that a week hence to-day Anglo-French stand higher than
they do at this moment."</p>

<p>Fischer hesitated. Then he turned away.</p>

<p>"I am not a sportsman, Mr. Lutchester," he said.</p>

<p>Lutchester brushed away a little dust from his coat
sleeve.</p>

<p>"No," he murmured, "I agree with you. Good morning!"</p>

<p>Lutchester walked out into the sun-baked streets, and with
his absence Fischer abandoned his almost unnatural calm. He
strode up and down the room, fuming with rage. At every fresh
click of the tape machine, he snatched at the printed slip
eagerly and threw it away with an oath. No one took any notice
of him. Van Teyl rushed in and out, telephones clanged,
perspiring clerks dashed in with copies of contracts to add to
the small pile upon the desk. There came a quiet moment
presently. Van Teyl wiped the perspiration from his forehead and
drank a tumblerful of water.</p>

<p>"Fischer," he asked, "what made you go into this so big? You
must have known there was always the risk of your wireless
report beating it up a little too tall."</p>

<p>"It wasn't our report at all that I went by," Fischer
confessed gloomily. "It was the English Admiralty announcement
that did it. Can you conceive," he went on, striking the table
with his fist, "any nation at war, with a grain of common sense
or an ounce of self-respect, issuing a statement like
that?&mdash;an apology for a defeat which, damn it all, never
happened! Say the thing was a drawn battle, which is about what
it really was. It didn't suit the Germans to fight it to a
finish. They'd everything to lose and little to gain. So in
effect they left the Britishers there and passed back behind
their own minefield. So far as regards reports, that was victory
enough for any one except those muddle-headed civilians at
Whitehall. They deceived the world with that infernal bulletin,
and incidentally me. It was on that statement I gave you my
orders, not on ours."</p>

<p>"It's a damned unfortunate business!" Van Teyl sighed.
"You're only half way out yet, and it's cost you nearly three
hundred thousand."</p>

<p>A dull spot of purple colour burned in Fischer's cheeks. His
upper lip was drawn in, his appearance for a moment was
repulsive.</p>

<p>"It isn't the money I mind," he muttered. "It's
Lutchester."</p>

<p>Van Teyl was discreetly silent. Fischer seemed to read his
thoughts. He leaned across the table.</p>

<p>"A wonderful fellow, your friend Lutchester," he sneered. "An
Admirable Crichton of finance and diplomacy and love-making, eh?
But the end isn't just yet. I promise you one thing, James Van
Teyl. He isn't going to marry your sister."</p>

<p>"I'd a damned sight sooner she married him than you!" Van
Teyl blazed out.</p>

<p>Fischer was taken aback. He had held for so long the upper
hand with this young man that for the moment he had forgotten
that circumstances were changed between them. Van Teyl rose to
his feet. The bonds of the last few months had snapped. He spoke
like a free man.</p>

<p>"Look here, Fischer," he said, "you've had me practically in
your power for the best part of a year, but now I'm through with
you. I'm out of your debt, no thanks to you, and I'm going to
keep out. I am working on your business as hard as though you
were my own brother, and I'll go on doing it. I'll get you out
of this mess as well as I can, and after that you can take your
damned business where you please."</p>

<p>"So that's it, is it?" Fischer scoffed. "A rich
brother-in-law coming along, eh? ... No, don't do that,"
stepping quickly backwards as Van Teyl's fist shot out.</p>

<p>"Then keep my sister's name out of this conversation," Van
Teyl insisted. "If you are wise, you'll clear out altogether.
They're at it again."</p>

<p>Fischer, however, glanced at the clock and remained. At the
next lull, he hung down the tape and turned to his
companion.</p>

<p>"Say, there's no use quarrelling, James," he declared. "I'm
going to leave you to it now. Guess I said a little more than I
meant to, but I tell you I hate that fellow Lutchester. I hate
him just as though I were the typical German and he were the
typical Britisher, and there was nothing but a sea of hate
between us. Shake hands, Jim."</p>

<p>Van Teyl obeyed without enthusiasm. Fischer drew a chair to
the table and wrote out a cheque, which he passed across.</p>

<p>"I'll drop into the bank and let them know about this," he
said. "You can make up accounts and let me hear how the balance
stands. I'll wipe it out by return, whatever it is."</p>

<p>Fischer passed out of the offices a few minutes later,
followed by many curious eyes, and stepped into his automobile.
A young man who had brushed against him pushed a note into his
hand. Fischer opened it as his car swung slowly through the
traffic:&mdash;</p>

<p>Guards at all Connecticut factories doubled. O'Hagan caught
last night in precincts of small arms factory. Was taken alive,
disobeying orders. Be careful.</p>

<p>Fischer tore the note into small pieces. His face was grimmer
than ever as he leaned back amongst the cushions. There were
evil things awaiting him outside Wall Street.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch32"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<p class="first">LUTCHESTER breathed the air of Washington and
felt almost homesick. The stateliness of the city, its sedate
and quiescent air after the turmoil of New York, impressed him
profoundly. Everywhere its diplomatic associations made
themselves felt. Congress was in session, and the faces of the
men whom he met continually in the hotels and restaurants seemed
to him some index of the world power which flung its
far-reaching arms from beneath the Capitol dome.</p>

<p>One afternoon a few days after his arrival he called at the
Hastings' house, a great Colonial mansion within a stone's throw
of his own headquarters. The mention of his name, however,
seemed to chill all the hospitality out of the smiling face of
the southern butler who answered his ring. Miss Van Teyl was
out, and from the man's manner it was obvious that Miss Van Teyl
would continue to be out for a very long time. Lutchester
retraced his steps to the British Embassy, where he had spent
most of the morning, and made his way to the sitting-room of one
of the secretaries. The Honourable Philip Downing, who was
eagerly waiting for a cable recalling him to take up a promised
commission, welcomed him heartily.</p>

<p>"Things are slack here to-day, old fellow. Let's go out to
the Country Club and have a few sets of tennis or a game of
golf, whichever you prefer," he suggested. "I've done my little
lot till the evening."</p>

<p>"Show on to-night, isn't there?" Lutchester inquired.</p>

<p>"Just a reception. You're going to put in an appearance?"</p>

<p>"I fancy so. Have you got your list of guests handy?"</p>

<p>The young man dived into a drawer and produced a few
typewritten sheets.</p>

<p>"Alphabetical list of acceptances, with here and there a few
personal notes," he pointed out, with an air of
self-satisfaction. "I go through this list with the chief while he's changing for dinner."</p>

<p>Lutchester ran his forefinger down the list.</p>

<p>"Senator Theodore and Mrs. Hastings," he quoted. "By the bye,
they have a niece staying with them."</p>

<p>"Want a card for her?" the Honourable Philip inquired with a
grin.</p>

<p>"I should like it sent off this moment," Lutchester
replied.</p>

<p>The young man took a square, gilt-edged card from a drawer by
his side, filled it out at Lutchester's dictation, rang the
bell, and dispatched it by special messenger.</p>

<p>"I've got my little buzzer outside," he observed. "We'll make
tracks for the club, if you're ready."</p>

<p>The two men played several sets of tennis and afterwards
lounged in two wicker chairs, underneath a gigantic plane tree
in a corner of the lawn. The place was crowded, and Philip
Downing was an excellent showman.</p>

<p>"Washington," he explained, "has never been so divided into
opposite camps, and this is almost the only common meeting
ground. Every one has to come here, of course. The German Staff
play tennis and the Austrians all go in for polo. Here comes
Ziduski. He's most fearfully popular with the ladies
here&mdash;does us a lot of harm, they say. He's a great sticker
for etiquette. He used to nod and call me Phil. Now you watch.
He'll bow from his waist, as though he had corsets on. As a
matter of fact, he's a good sportsman."</p>

<p>Count Ziduski's bow was stiff enough but his intention was
obvious. He stopped before the two men, exchanged a somewhat
stilted greeting with Philip Downing, and turned to
Lutchester.</p>

<p>"I believe," he said, "that I have the honour of addressing
Mr. Lutchester?"</p>

<p>Lutchester rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"That is my name," he admitted.</p>

<p>"We have met in Rome, I think, and in Paris," the Count
reminded him. "If I might beg for the favour of a few moments'
conversation with you."</p>

<p>The two men strolled away together. The Count plunged at once
into the middle of things.</p>

<p>"It is you, sir, I believe, whom I have to thank for the
abrupt departure of Mademoiselle Sonia from New York?"</p>

<p>"Quite true," Lutchester admitted.</p>

<p>"Under different circumstances," the Count proceeded, "I
might regard such interference in my affairs in a different
manner. Here, of course, that is impossible. I speak to you out
of regard for the lady in question. You appear in some
mysterious manner to have discovered the fact that she was in
the habit of bringing entirely unimportant and non-political
messages from dear friends in France."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Sonia," Lutchester said calmly, "had for a
brief space of time forgotten herself. She was engaged in
carrying out espionage work on your behalf. I believe I may say
that she will do so no more."</p>

<p>The Count was a man of medium height, thin, with complexion
absolutely colourless, and deep-set, tired eyes. At this moment,
however, he seemed endowed with the spirit of a new virility.
The cane which he grasped might have been a dagger. His smooth
tones nursed a threat.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lutchester," he declared, "if harm should come to her
through your information, I swear to God that you shall
pay!"</p>

<p>Lutchester's manner was mild and unprovocative.</p>

<p>"Count," he replied, "we make no war upon women. Sonia has
repented, and the knowledge which I have of her misdeeds will be
shared by no one. She has gone back to her country to work for
the Red Cross there. So far as I am concerned, that is the
end."</p>

<p>The two men walked a few steps further in unbroken silence.
Then the Count raised his hat.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lutchester," he said, "yours is the reply of an
honourable enemy. I might have trusted you, but Sonia is half of
my life. I offer you my thanks."</p>

<p>He strolled away, and Lutchester rejoined his young
friend.</p>

<p>"The lion and the lamb seem to have parted safely!" the
latter exclaimed. "Now sit by my side and I will show you
interesting things. Those four irreproachable young men over
there in tennis flannels are all from the German Embassy. The
two elder ones behind are Austrians. All those women are the
wives of Senators who sympathise with Germany. Their husbands
look like it, don't they? To-day they have an addition to their
ranks&mdash;the thin, elderly man there, whose clothes were
evidently made in London. That's Senator Hastings. He is a
personal friend of the President. Jove, what a beautiful girl
with Mrs. Hastings!"</p>

<p>"That," Lutchester told him, "is the young lady to whom you
have just sent a card of invitation for to-night."</p>

<p>"Then here's hoping that she comes," Philip Downing observed,
finishing his glass of mint julep. "Is she a pal of yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know her," Lutchester admitted.</p>

<p>"Let's go and butt in, then," Downing suggested. "I love
breaking up these little gatherings. You'll see them all stiffen
when we come near. I hope they haven't got hold of Hastings,
though."</p>

<p>The two men rose to their feet and crossed the lawn. Fischer,
who had suddenly appeared in the background, whispered something
in Mrs. Hastings' ear. She swung around to Pamela, a second too
late. Pamela, with a word of excuse to the young man with whom
she was talking, stepped away from the circle and held out her
hand to Lutchester.</p>

<p>"So you have really come to Washington!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"As a rescuer," Lutchester replied. "I feel that I have a
mission. We cannot afford to lose your sympathies. May I
introduce Philip Downing?"</p>

<p>Pamela shook hands with the young man and took her place
between them.</p>

<p>"I've been envying you your seat under the tree," she said.
"Couldn't we go there for a few moments?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Hastings detached herself and approached them. She
received Philip Downing's bow cordially, and she was almost
civil to Lutchester.</p>

<p>"I can't have my niece taken away," she protested. "We are
just going in to tea, Pamela."</p>

<p>Pamela shook her head.</p>

<p>"I am going to sit under that tree with Mr. Lutchester and
Mr. Downing," she declared. "Tea doesn't attract me in the
least, and that tree does."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hastings accepted defeat with a somewhat cynical
gracefulness. She closed her lorgnette with a little snap.</p>

<p>"You leave us all desolated, my dear Pamela," she said. "You
remind me of what your poor dear father used to
say&mdash;'Almost any one could live with Pamela if she always
had her own way.'"</p>

<p>Pamela laughed as she strolled across the lawn.</p>

<p>"Aren't one's relatives trying!" she murmured.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch33"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<p class="first">PHILIP DOWNING very soon justified the
profession to which he belonged by strolling off with some
excuse about paying his respects to some acquaintances. Pamela
and Lutchester immediately dropped the somewhat frivolous tone
of their conversation.</p>

<br>

Pamela and Lutchester immediately dropped the<br>
somewhat frivolous tone of their conversation.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>"You know that things are moving with our friend Fischer?"
she began.</p>

<p>"I gathered so," Lutchester assented.</p>

<p>"His scheme is growing into shape," she went on. "You know
what wonderful people his friends are for organising. Well, they
are going to start a society all through the States and nominate
for its president&mdash;Uncle Theodore."</p>

<p>"Will they have any show at all?" Lutchester asked
curiously.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Who can tell? The German-Americans are very powerful indeed
all through the West, and then the pacifists will join them. You
see, I believe that although the soul of the country is with the
Allies, England is the most tactless country in the world. She
is always giving little pinpricks to the Government over here,
either about maritime law or one thing or another. Then all
those articles in the papers about America being too proud to
fight, the sneering tone of some, even, of the leading reviews,
did a lot of harm. Uncle Theodore is going to stand for what
they call the true neutrality. That is to say, no munitions, no
help for either side."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know anything about American politics,"
Lutchester confessed, "but I shouldn't think he'd have an
earthly chance."</p>

<p>"Money is immensely powerful," she went on reflectively, "and
many of the great money interests of the country are controlled
by German-Americans. Mr. Fischer has almost thrown me over
politically, but Uncle Theodore is crazy about the idea of a
German pledge to protect America against Japan. That is going to
be the great argument which he will keep up his sleeve until
after the nomination."</p>

<p>"Fischer's trump card," Lutchester observed. "He hasn't shown
you a certain autograph letter yet, I suppose?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"He may have shown it to Uncle Theodore. I'm afraid he
doesn't mean to approach me again. He seems to have completely
changed his attitude towards me since the night he saw us at the
Ritz-Carlton dining together. He was going to show me the letter
the first day after his arrival in Washington. Instead of that,
he has been in the house for hours at a time without making the
slightest attempt to see me."</p>

<p>"Faithless fellow!" Lutchester murmured. "Nothing like an
Englishman, after all, for absolute fidelity."</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?" Pamela inquired anxiously. "Do you
think I should be safe in trusting my heart and future to an
Englishman?"</p>

<p>"To one particular Englishman, yes!" was the firm reply. "I
was rather hoping you might have made up your mind."</p>

<p>"Too many things to think about," she laughed. "How long are
you going to stay in Washington?"</p>

<p>"A few hours or days or weeks&mdash;until I have finished the
work that brought me here."</p>

<p>"And what exactly is that?"</p>

<p>"You ask me lightly," he replied, "but, if you are willing, I
have decided to take you into my confidence. Our friend Nikasti
will be here to-morrow. He was to have sailed for Japan
yesterday, but he has postponed his voyage for a few days. Do
you know much about the Japanese, Miss Pamela?"</p>

<p>"Very little," she acknowledged.</p>

<p>"Well, I will tell you one thing. They are not very good at
forgiving. There was only one way I could deal with Nikasti in
New York, and it was a brutal way. I have seen him twice since.
He wouldn't look me in the eyes. I know what that means. He
hates me. In a sense I don't believe he would allow that to
interfere in any way with his mission. In another sense it
would. The Allies, above all things, have need of Japan. We want
Japan and America to be friends. We don't want Germany butting
in between the two. Baron Yung is a very clever man, but he is
even more impenetrable than his countrymen generally are. Our
people here admit that they find it difficult to progress with
him very far. They believe that secretly he is in sympathy with
Nikasti's reports&mdash; but you don't know about those, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I do," she admitted.</p>

<p>"Nikasti was sent to England some years ago to report upon us
as a country. Japan at that time was meditating an alliance with
one of the great European Powers. Obviously it must be Germany
or England. Nikasti travelled all through England, studied our
social life, measured our weaknesses; did the same through
Germany, returned to Japan, and gave his vote in favour of
Germany. I have even seen a copy of his report. He laid great
stress upon the absolute devotion to sport of our young men, and
the entire absence of any patriotic sentiment or any means of
national defence. Well, as you know, for various reasons his
counsels were over-ridden, and Japan chose the British alliance.
That was entirely the fault of imperfect German diplomacy. At a
time like this, though, I cannot help thinking that some
elements of his former distrust still remain in Nikasti's mind,
and I have an idea that Baron Yung is, to a certain extent, a
sympathiser. I've got to get at the bottom of this before I
leave the States. If I need your help, will you give it me?"</p>

<p>"If I can," she promised.</p>

<p>They saw Mrs. Hastings' figure on the terrace, waving, and
Pamela rose reluctantly to her feet.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose," Lutchester continued, as they strolled
across the lawn, "that you have very much influence with your
uncle, or that he would listen very much to anything that you
have to say, but if he is really in earnest about this thing, he
is going to play a terribly dangerous game. As things are at
present, he has a very pleasant and responsible position as the
supporter and friend of very able men. With regard to this new
movement, he may find the whole ground crumble away beneath his
feet. Fischer is playing the game of a madman. It isn't only
political defeat that might come to him, but disgrace&mdash;
even dishonour."</p>

<p>"You frighten me," Pamela confessed gravely.</p>

<p>Lutchester sighed.</p>

<p>"Your uncle," he went on, "is one of those thoroughly
conceited, egotistical men who will probably listen to no one.
You see, I have found out a little about him already. But they
tell me that her social position means a great deal to your
aunt. Neither her birth nor her friends could save her if
Fischer drags your uncle to his chariot wheels."</p>

<p>"Do you think, perhaps, that you underestimate Mr. Fischer's
position over here?" she asked thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I don't think I do," he replied, "but here is something
which you have scarcely appreciated. Fischer has had the
effrontery to link himself up with a little crowd of Germans all
through the States, who are making organised attempts to destroy
the factories where ammunitions are being made for the Allies.
That sort of thing, you know, would bring any one, however,
distantly connected with it, to Sing Sing.... One moment," he
added quickly, as Mrs. Hastings stepped forward to meet them;
"the reception at the British Embassy to-night?"</p>

<p>"The others are going," she said. "My aunt didn't feel she
was sufficiently&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We sent you a card round especially this afternoon,"
Lutchester interrupted. "You'll come?"</p>

<p>"How nice of you! Of course I will," she promised.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch34"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<p class="first">"SMALL affair, this," Downing observed, as he
piloted Lutchester through the stately reception rooms of the
Embassy. "You see, we are all living a sort of touchy life here,
nowadays. We try to be civil to any of the German or Austrian
lot when we meet, but of course they don't come to our
functions. And every now and then some of those plaguey neutrals
get the needle and they don't come, so we never know quite where
we are, Guadopolis has been avoiding us lately, and I hear he
was seen out at the Lakewood Country Club with Count Reszka, the
Rumanian Minister, a few days ago. Gave the Chief quite a little
flurry, that did."</p>

<p>"There's an idea over in London," Lutchester remarked, "that
a good deal of the war is being shaped in Washington
nowadays."</p>

<p>"That is the Chief's notion," Downing assented. "I know he's
pining to talk to you, so we'll go and do the dutiful."</p>

<p>Lutchester was welcomed as an old friend by both the
Ambassador and his wife. The former drew him to a divan from
which he could watch the entrance to the rooms, and sat by his
side.</p>

<p>"I am glad they sent you out, Lutchester," he said earnestly.
"If ever a country needed watching by a man with intelligence
and experience, this one does to-day."</p>

<p>"Do you happen to know that fellow Oscar Fischer?" Lutchester
asked.</p>

<p>"I do, and I consider him one of the most dangerous people in
the States for us," the Ambassador declared. "He has a great
following, huge wealth, and, although he is not a man of
culture, he doesn't go about his job in that bull-headed way
that most of them do."</p>

<p>"He's trying things on with Japan," Lutchester observed. "I
think I shall manage to checkmate him there all right. But
there's another scheme afloat that I don't follow so closely.
You know Senator Hastings, I suppose?"</p>

<p>The Ambassador nodded.</p>

<p>"Senator Theodore Hastings," he repeated thoughtfully. "Yes,
he's rather a dark horse. He is supposed to be the President's
bosom friend, but I hear whispers that he'd give his soul for a
nomination, adopt any cause or fight any one's battle."</p>

<p>"That's my own idea of him," Lutchester replied, "and I think
you will find him in the field with a pretty definite platform
before long."</p>

<p>"You think he's mixed up with Fischer?" the Ambassador
inquired.</p>

<p>"I'm sure he is," Lutchester assented. "Not only that, but
they have something up their sleeve. I think I can guess what it
is, but I'm not sure. How have things seemed to you here
lately?"</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, I haven't liked the look of them,"
the Ambassador confided. "There's something afoot, and I can't
be sure what it is. Look at the crowd to-night. Of course, all
the Americans are here, but the diplomatic attendance has never
been so thin. The Rumanian Minister and his wife, the Italian,
the Spanish, and the Swedish representatives are all absent. I
have just heard, too, that Baron von Schwerin is giving a
dinner-party."</p>

<p>Lutchester looked thoughtfully at the little stream of
people. The Ambassador left him for a few moments to welcome
some late comers. He returned presently and resumed his seat by
Lutchester's side.</p>

<p>"Of course," he continued, lowering his voice, "all formal
communications between us and the enemy Embassies have ceased,
but it has come to be an understood thing, to avoid
embarrassments to our mutual friends, that we do not hold
functions on the same day. I heard that Von Schwerin was giving
this dinner-party, so I sent round this morning to inquire. The
reply was that it was entirely a private one. One of our
youngsters brought us in a list of the guests a short time ago.
I see Hastings is one of them, and Fischer, and Rumania and
Greece will be represented. Now Hastings was to have been here,
and as a rule the neutrals are very punctilious."</p>

<p>"I suppose the way that naval affair was represented didn't
do us any good," Lutchester observed.</p>

<p>"It did us harm, without a doubt," was the lugubrious
admission. "Still, fortunately, these people over here are
clever enough to understand our idiosyncrasies. I honestly think
we'd rather whine about a defeat than glory in a victory."</p>

<p>"Diplomatically, too," Lutchester remarked thoughtfully, "I
should have said that things seemed all right here. The
President comes in for a great deal of abuse in some countries.
Personally, I think he has been wonderful."</p>

<p>The Ambassador nodded.</p>

<p>"You and I both know, Lutchester," he said, "that the last
thing we want is to find America dragged into this war. Such a
happening would be nothing more nor less than a catastrophe in
itself, to say nothing of the internal dissensions here. On the
other hand, as things are now, Washington is becoming a perfect
arena for diplomatic chicanery, and I have just an
instinct&mdash;I can't define it in any way&mdash;which leads me
to believe that some fresh trouble has started within the last
twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>Lady Ridlingshawe motioned to her husband with her fan, and
he rose at once to his feet.</p>

<p>"I must leave you to look after yourself for a time,
Lutchester," he concluded. "You'll find plenty of people here
you know. Don't go until you've seen me again."</p>

<p>Lutchester wandered off in search of Pamela. He found her
with Mrs. Hastings, surrounded by a little crowd of
acquaintances. Pamela waved her fan, and they made way for
him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lutchester, I have been looking everywhere for you!" she
exclaimed. "What a secretive person you are! Why couldn't you
tell me that Lady Ridlingshawe was your cousin? I want you to
take me to her, please, I met her sister out in Nice."</p>

<p>She laid her fingers upon his arm, and they passed out of the
little circle.</p>

<p>"All bluff, of course," she murmured. "Find the quietest
place you can. I want to talk to you."</p>

<p>They wandered out on to a balcony where some of the younger
people were taking ices. She leaned over the wooden rail.</p>

<p>"Listen," she said, "I adore this atmosphere, and I am
perfectly certain there is something going on&mdash;something
exciting, I mean. You know that the Baron von Schwerin has a
dinner-party?"</p>

<p>"I know that," he assented.</p>

<p>"Uncle Theodore is going with Mr. Fischer. He was invited at
the last moment, and I understand that his presence was
specially requested."</p>

<p>Lutchester stood for a short time in an absorbed and sombre
silence. In the deep blue twilight his face seemed to have
fallen into sterner lines. Without a doubt he was disturbed.
Pamela looked at him anxiously.</p>

<p>"Is anything the matter?" she asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Nothing definite, only for the last few hours I have felt
that things here are reaching a crisis. There is something going
on around us, something which seems to fill Fischer and his
friends with confidence, something which I don't quite
understand, and which it is my business to understand. That is
really what is worrying me."</p>

<p>She nodded sympathetically and glanced around for a
moment.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you something," she whispered. "This evening my
uncle came into my room just before dinner. There is a little
safe built in the wall for jewellery. He begged for the loan of
it. His library safe, he said, was out of order. I couldn't see
what he put in, but when he had closed the door he stood looking
at it for a moment curiously. I made some jesting remark about
its being a treasure chest, but he answered me seriously. 'You
are going to sleep to-night, Pamela,' he said, 'within a few
yards of a dozen or so of written words which will change the
world's history.'"</p>

<p>Lutchester was listening intently. There was a prolonged
pause.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked, at last.</p>

<p>She glanced at the little Yale key which hung from her
bracelet.</p>

<p>"Nothing! I was just wondering how I should be able to sleep
through the night without opening the safe."</p>

<p>"But surely your uncle didn't give you the key!"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose he knows I have such a thing," she replied.
"He has a master-key himself to all the safes, which he used.
This is one the housekeeper gave me as soon as I arrived."</p>

<p>Lutchester looked out into the darkness.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he inquired, "is that your house&mdash;the next
one to this?"</p>

<p>"That's the old Hastings' house," she assented. "They are all
family mansions along here."</p>

<p>"It looks an easy place to burgle," he remarked.</p>

<p>She laughed quietly.</p>

<p>"I should think it would be," she admitted. "There are any
quantity of downstair windows. We don't have burglaries in
Washington, though &mdash;certainly not this side of the
city."</p>

<p>A little bevy of young people had found their way into the
gardens. Lutchester waited until they had passed out of earshot
before he spoke again.</p>

<p>"I have reason to believe," he continued, "that in the course
of their negotiations Fischer has deposited with your uncle a
certain autograph letter, of which we have already spoken,
making definite proposals to America if she will change her
attitude on the neutrality question."</p>

<p>"The written words," Pamela murmured.</p>

<p>Lutchester's hand suddenly closed upon her wrist. She was
surprised to find his fingers so cold, yet marvellously
tenacious.</p>

<p>"You are going to lose that key and I am going to find it,"
he said, quietly. "I am sorry&mdash;but you must."</p>

<p class="caption">"You are going to lose that key and I am going to find it."</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>"I am going to do nothing of the sort," Pamela objected.</p>

<p>His fingers remained like a cold vice upon her wrist. She
made no effort to draw it away.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said; "do you believe that the
Hastings-cum-Fischer party is going to be the best thing that could happen for America?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do not," she admitted.</p>

<p>"Then do as I beg. Let me take that key from your bracelet.
You shall have no other responsibility."</p>

<p>"And what are you going to do with it?"</p>

<p>"You must leave that to me," he answered. "I will tell you as
much as I can. I stopped Nikasti sailing for Japan, but I made a
mortal enemy of him at the same time. He has come to Washington
to consult with his Ambassador. They are together tonight. It is
my mission to convince them of Germany's duplicity."</p>

<p>"I see.... And you think that these written
words&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Give the key to me," he begged, "and ask no questions."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I should object most strongly to nocturnal disturbers of my
slumbers!"</p>

<p>It seemed to her that his frame had become tenser, his tone
harder. The grip of his fingers was still upon her wrist.</p>

<p>"Even your objection," he said, "might not relieve you of the
possibility of their advent."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," she answered, "and, above all, don't try to
threaten me. If you want my help&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked steadfastly across at the looming outline of the
Hastings' house.</p>

<p>"I do want your help," he assured her.</p>

<p>"How long should you require the letter for?"</p>

<p>"One hour," he replied.</p>

<p>She led him down some steps on to the smooth lawns which
encircled the house. They passed in and out of some gigantic
shrubs until at last they came to a paling. She felt along it
for a few yards.</p>

<p>"There is a gate there," she told him. "Can you do anything
with it?"</p>

<p>It was fastened by an old lock. He lifted it off its hinges,
and they both passed through.</p>

<p>"Keep behind the shrubs as much as you can," she whispered.
"There is a way into the house from the verandah here."</p>

<p>They reached at last the shadow of the building. She
paused.</p>

<p>"Wait here for me," she continued. "I would rather enter the
house without being seen, if I can, but it doesn't really
matter. I can make some excuse for coming back. Don't move from
where you are."</p>

<p>She glided away from him and disappeared. Lutchester waited,
standing well back in the shadow of the shrubs. From the Embassy
came all the time the sound of music, occasionally even the
murmur of voices; from the dark house in front of him, nothing.
Suddenly he heard what seemed to be the opening of a window, and
then soft footsteps. Pamela appeared round the corner of the
building, a white, spectral figure against that background of
deep blue darkness. She came on tiptoe, running down the steps
and holding her skirts with both hands.</p>

<p>"Not a soul has seen me," she whispered. "Take this
quickly."</p>

<p>She thrust an envelope into his hands, and something hard
with it.</p>

<p>"That's Uncle Theodore's seal," she explained. "He sealed up
the envelope when he put it in there. Now come back quickly to
the Embassy. You must please hurry with what you want to do. If
I have left when you return, you must come back to exactly this
place. That window"&mdash;she pointed upwards&mdash;"will be
wide open. You must throw a pine cone or a pebble through it. I
shall be waiting."</p>

<p>"I understand," he assured her.</p>

<p>They retraced their steps. Once more they drew near to the
Embassy. The night had grown warmer and more windows had been
opened. They reached the verandah. She touched his hand for a
moment.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "I don't know whether I have been wise or
not. Try and be back in less than an hour, if you can. I am
going in alone."</p>

<p>She left him, and Lutchester, after a few brief words with
the Ambassador, hurried away to his task. In twenty minutes he
stood before a tall, grey-stone building, a few blocks away, was
admitted by a Japanese butler, and conducted, after some
hesitation, into a large room at the back of the house. An
elderly man, dressed for the evening, with the lapel of his coat
covered with orders, was awaiting him.</p>

<p>"I am a stranger to you, Baron," Lutchester began.</p>

<p>"That does not matter," was the grave reply. "Ten minutes ago
I had an urgent telephone call from our mutual friend. His
Excellency told me that he was sending a special messenger, and
begged me to give you a few minutes. I have left a conference of
some importance, and I am here."</p>

<p>"A few minutes will be enough," Lutchester promised. "I am
engaged by the English Government upon Secret Service work. I
came to America, following a man named Fischer. You have heard
of him?"</p>

<p>"I have heard of him," the Ambassador acknowledged.</p>

<p>"In New York," Lutchester continued, "he met one of your
countrymen, Prince Nikasti, a man, I may add," Lutchester went
on, "for whom I have the highest respect and esteem, although
quite openly, years ago, he pronounced himself unfavourably
disposed towards my country. The object of Fischer's meeting
with Prince Nikasti was to convey to him certain definite
proposals on behalf of the German Government. They wish for a
rapprochement with your country. They offer certain terms,
confirmation of which Fischer brought with him in an autograph
letter."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. Not a word came from the man
who seemed to have learnt the gift of sitting with absolute
immovability. Even his eyes did not blink. He sat and
waited.</p>

<p>"The proposals made to you are plausible and deserving of
consideration," Lutchester proceeded. "Do not think that there
exists in my mind, or would exist in the mind of any Englishman
knowing of them, any feeling of resentment that these proposals
should have been received by you for consideration. Nothing in
this world counts to those who follow the arts of diplomacy,
save the simple welfare of the people whom he represents. It is
therefore the duty of every patriot to examine carefully all
proposals made to him likely to militate to the advantage of his
own people. You have a letter, offering you certain terms to
withdraw from your present alliances. Here is a letter from the
same source, in the same handwriting, written to America. Break
the seal yourself. It was brought to this country by Fischer, in
the same dispatch box as yours, to be handed to some responsible
person in the American Government. It was handed to Senator
Theodore Hastings. It is to form part of his platform on the day
when his nomination as President is announced. It must be back
in his safe within three-quarters of an hour. Break the seal and
read it."</p>

<p>The Japanese held out his hand, broke the seal of the
envelope, and read. His face remained immovable. When he had
finished he looked up at his visitor.</p>

<p>"I am permitted to take a copy?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly!"</p>

<p>He touched a bell, spoke down a mouthpiece, and with almost
necromantic swiftness two young men were in the room. A camera
was dragged out, a little flash of light shot up to the ceiling,
and the attaches vanished as quickly as they had come. The
Ambassador replaced the document in its envelope, handed a stick
of sealing-wax and a candle to Lutchester, who leaned over and
resealed the envelope.</p>

<p>"The negative?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"Will be kept under lock and key," the Ambassador promised.
"It will pass into the archives of Japanese history. In future
we shall know."</p>

<p>Once more he touched a bell. The door was opened. Lutchester
found himself escorted into the street. He was back at the
Embassy in time to meet a little stream of departing guests.
Lady Ridlingshawe patted him on the shoulder with her fan.</p>

<p>"Deserter!" she exclaimed, reproachfully, "Wherever have you
been hiding?"</p>

<p>Lutchester made some light reply and passed on. He made his
way out into the gardens. The darkness now was a little more
sombre, and he had to grope his way to the palings. Soon he
stood before the dark outline of the adjoining house. In the
window towards which he was making his way a single candle in a
silver candlestick was burning. He paused underneath and
listened. Then he took a pine cone which he had picked up on his
way and threw it through the open window. The candle was
withdrawn. A shadowy form leaned out.</p>

<p>"I'm quite alone," she assured him softly. "Can you throw it
in?"</p>

<br>

"I'm quite alone," she assured him. "Can you throw it in?"</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>His first effort was successful. The seal followed, wrapped
up in his handkerchief. A moment or two later he saw Pamela's
face at the window.</p>

<p>"Good night!" she whispered. "Quickly, please. There is still
some one about downstairs."</p>

<p>The light was extinguished. Lutchester made his way
cautiously back, replaced the gate upon its hinges and reached
the shelter of the Embassy, denuded now of guests. He found
Downing in the smoking-room.</p>

<p>"Can I get a whisky and soda?" Lutchester asked, in response
to the latter's vociferous greeting.</p>

<p>"Call it a highball," was the prompt reply, "and you can have
as many as you like. Have you earned it?" he added, a little
curiously.</p>

<p>"I almost believe that I have," Lutchester assented.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch35"></a>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<p class="first">MR. OSCAR FISCHER and his friend, Senator
Theodore Hastings, stood side by side, a week later, in the bar
of one of the most fashionable of New York hotels. They were
passing away the few minutes before Pamela and her aunt would be
ready to join them in the dining room above.</p>

<p>"Very little news, I fancy," Hastings remarked, glancing at
the tape which was passing through his companion's fingers.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;of any importance," Fischer replied.
"Nothing."</p>

<p>The older man glanced searchingly at his companion, the
change in whose tone was ominous. Fischer was standing with the
tape in his hand, his eyes glued upon a certain paragraph. The
Senator took out his eyeglasses and looked over his friend's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"What's this?" he demanded. "Eh?"</p>

<p>Fischer was fighting a great battle and fighting it well.</p>

<p>"Something wrong, apparently, with Frank Roughton," he
observed; "an old college friend of mine. They made him Governor
of&mdash;&mdash;only last year."</p>

<p>Hastings read the item thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Governor Roughton this morning tendered his resignation as
Governor of the State of&mdash;&mdash;. We understand that it
was at once accepted. Numerous arrests have taken place with
reference to the great explosion at the Bembridge powder
factory.</p>

<p>"Looks rather fishy, that," Hastings observed
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for Roughton," Fischer declared. "He was a
perfectly straight man, and I am sure he has done his best."</p>

<p>"Great friend of yours?" the other asked curiously.</p>

<p>"We were intimately acquainted," was the brief answer.</p>

<p>The two men finished their cocktails in silence. On their way
upstairs the Senator took his companion's arm.</p>

<p>"Fischer," he said, "you'll forgive me if I put a certain
matter to you plainly?"</p>

<p>"Naturally!"</p>

<p>"Within the last few days," Hastings proceeded, "there have
been seven explosions or fires at various factories throughout
the States. It is a somewhat significant circumstance," he
added, after a slight pause, "that every one of these
misfortunes has occurred at a factory where munitions of some
sort for the Allies have been in process of manufacture. Shrewd
men have naturally come to the conclusion that there is some
organisation at work."</p>

<p>"I should doubt it," Fischer replied. "You must remember that
there is always a great risk of disasters in factories where
explosives are being handled. It is a new thing to many of the
manufacturers here, and it is obvious that they are not making
use of all the necessary precautions."</p>

<p>"I see," Hastings observed, reflectively. "So that is how you
would explain this epidemic of disasters, eh?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!"</p>

<p>"At the same time, Fischer, to set my mind entirely at rest,"
Hastings continued, "I should like your assurance that you have
nothing whatever to do with any organisation, should there be
such a thing, including in its object the destruction of
American property."</p>

<p>"I will do more than answer your question in the direct
negative," was the firm reply. "I will assure you that no such
organisation exists."</p>

<p>"I am relieved to hear it," Hastings confessed. "This
resignation of Roughton, however, seems a strange thing. Most of
these fires have occurred in his State.... Ah! there is Senator
Joyce waiting for us, and Pamela and Mrs. Hastings."</p>

<p>Mr. Hastings as a host was in his element. His manners and
tact, which his enemies declared were far too perfect, were both
admirably displayed in the smaller ways of life. He guided the
conversation into light yet opportune subjects, and he utterly
ignored the fact that Senator Joyce, one of the great
politicians of the day, whose support of his nomination was
already more than half promised, seemed distrait and a little
cold. It was Pamela who quite inadvertently steered the
conversation into a dangerous channel.</p>

<p>"What has Governor Roughton been doing, Mr. Fischer?" she
asked.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. Pamela's question had fallen
something like a bombshell amongst the little party. It was
their guest who replied.</p>

<p>"The matter is occupying the attention of the country very
largely at the moment, Miss Van Teyl," he said. "It is perhaps
unfortunate that Governor Roughton seems to have allowed his
sympathies to be so clearly known."</p>

<p>"He is a German by birth, is he not?" Pamela inquired.</p>

<p>"Most decidedly not," Fischer asserted. "I was at Harvard
with him."</p>

<p>"All the same," Pamela murmured under her breath, "I think
that he was born at Stuttgart."</p>

<p>"He is an American citizen," Senator Joyce observed, "and has
reached a high position here. We of the Administration may be
wrong," he continued, "but we believe, and we think that we have
a right to believe, that when any man of conscience and ideals
takes the oath, he is free from all previous prejudices. He is
an American citizen&mdash; nothing more and nothing less."</p>

<p>"Of course, that is magnificent," Pamela declared, "but it
isn't common sense, is it, and you haven't answered my original
question yet."</p>

<p>"I am not in a position to do so, Miss Van Teyl," Joyce
replied. "The trouble probably is that Governor Roughton has
been considered incompetent as so many of these disasters have
taken place unhindered in his State."</p>

<p>"There was a rumour," Pamela persisted, "that he was under
arrest."</p>

<p>"Quite untrue, I am sure," Fischer muttered.</p>

<p>There was a general diversion of the conversation, but the
sense of uneasiness remained. Pamela and Mrs. Hastings, at the
conclusion of the little banquet, acting upon a hint from their
host, made their way to one of the small drawing-rooms for their
coffee. Left alone, the three men drew their chairs closer
together. Joyce's fine face seemed somehow to have become a
little harder and more unsympathetic. He sipped the water, which
was his only beverage, and pushed away the cigars in which he
generally indulged.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hastings," he pronounced, "I have given the subject of
supporting your nomination my deepest consideration. I was at
one time, I must confess, favourably disposed towards the idea.
I have changed my mind. I have decided to give my support to the
present Administration."</p>

<p>Fischer's face was dark with anger. He even allowed an
expletive to escape from his lips. Hastings, however, remained
master of himself.</p>

<p>"I will not conceal from you, Mr. Joyce," he confessed, "that
I am exceedingly disappointed. You have fully considered
everything, I presume&mdash;our pledge, for instance, to
nominate you as my successor?"</p>

<p>"I have considered everything," Joyce replied. "The drawback
in my mind, to be frank with you, is that I doubt whether you
would receive sufficient support throughout the country. It is
my idea," he went on, "although I may be wrong, of course, that
the support of the German-Americans who, you must allow me to
maintain, are an exceedingly unneutral part of America, will
place you in an unpopular position. Should you succeed in
getting yourself elected, which I very much doubt, you will be
an unpopular President. I would rather wait my time."</p>

<p>"You have changed your views," Fischer muttered.</p>

<p>"To be perfectly frank with you, I have," Joyce acknowledged.
"These outrages throughout the States are, to my mind, blatant
and criminal. Directly or indirectly, the German-American public
is responsible for them&mdash;indirectly, by inflammatory
speeches, reckless journalism, and point-blank laudation of
illegal acts; directly&mdash;well, here I can speak only from my
own suspicions, so I will remain silent. But my mind is made up.
A man in this country, as you know," he added, "need make only
one mistake and his political future is blasted. I am not
inclined to risk making that one mistake."</p>

<p>Hastings sighed. He was making a brave effort to conceal a
great disappointment.</p>

<p>"One cannot argue with you, Mr. Joyce," he regretted. "You
have come to a certain conclusion, and words are not likely to
alter it. There is no one I would so dearly have loved to number
amongst my supporters, but I see that it is a privilege for
which I may not hope.... We will, if you are ready, Fischer,
join the ladies."</p>

<p>They rose from the table a few minutes later.</p>

<p>Fischer, who had been eagerly watching his opportunity, drew
Senator Joyce on one side for a moment as they passed down the
crowded corridor.</p>

<p>"Mr. Joyce," he said, "I have heard your decision to-night
with deeper regret than I can express, yet more than ever it has
brought home one truth to me. Our position towards you was a
wrong one. We offered you a reversion when we should have
offered you the thing itself."</p>

<p>Senator Joyce swung around.</p>

<p>"Say, Mr. Fischer, what are you getting at?" he asked
bluntly.</p>

<p>"I mean that it is Hastings and I who should have been your
supporters, and you who should have been our candidate," Fischer
suggested boldly. "What about it? It isn't too late."</p>

<p>"Nothing doing, sir," was the firm reply. "Theodore Hastings
may not be exactly my type of man, but I am not out to see him
cornered like that, and besides, to tell you the honest truth,
Mr. Fischer," he added, pausing at the door, "when I stand for
the Presidency, I want to do so not on the nomination of you or
your friends, or any underground schemers. I want the support of
the real American citizen. I want to be free from, all outside
ties and obligations. I want to stand for America, and America
only, I not only want to be President, you see, but I want to be
the chosen President of the right sort of people.... I am going
to ask you to excuse me to the ladies and our host, Mr.
Fischer," he concluded, holding out his hand. "I had a note
asking me to visit the Attorney General, which I only received
on my way here. I have an idea that it is about this Roughton
business."</p>

<p>Fischer returned to the others alone. Hastings was clearly
disturbed at his guest's departure. His friend and supporter,
however, affected to treat it lightly.</p>

<p>"Joyce is like all these lawyers," he declared. "He is simply
waiting to see which way the wind blows. I have come across them
many times. They like to wait till parties are evenly balanced,
till their support makes all the difference, and clinch their
bargain then."</p>

<p>"I should have said," Pamela remarked, "that Mr. Joyce was a
man above that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Every man has his price and his weak spot," her uncle
observed didactically. "Joyce's price is the Presidency. His
weak spot is popular adulation. I agree with Fischer. He will
probably join us later."</p>

<p>Mr. Hastings was summoned to the telephone, a moment or two
later. Mrs. Hastings sat down to write a note, and Pamela moved
her place over to Fischer's side. His face brightened at her
spontaneous movement. She shook her head, however, at the little
compliment with which he welcomed her.</p>

<p>"This afternoon," she said softly, "I met Mr.
Lutchester."</p>

<p>"Is he back in New York?" Fischer asked, frowning.</p>

<p>Pamela nodded.</p>

<p>"He told me something which I feel inclined to tell you," she
continued, glancing into her companion's haggard face with a
gleam of sympathy in her eyes. "You'll probably see it in the
newspapers to-morrow morning. Governor Roughton's resignation
was compulsory. He is under arrest."</p>

<p>"For negligence?"</p>

<p>"For participation," was the grave reply. "Mr. Lutchester has
been down to&mdash; the city where these things took place. He
only got back late this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Lutchester again!" Fischer muttered.</p>

<p>"You see, it's rather in his line," Pamela reminded him. "He
is over here to superintend the production of munitions from the
factories which are working for the British Government."</p>

<p>"He is over here as a sort of general mischief-maker!"
Fischer exclaimed fiercely. "Do I understand that he has been
down in&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Pamela nodded.</p>

<p>"He went down with one of the heads of the New York
police."</p>

<p>She turned away, but Fischer caught at her wrist.</p>

<p>"You know more than this!" he cried hoarsely.</p>

<p>The agony in the man's face and tone touched her. After all,
he was fighting for the great things. There was nothing mean
about Fischer, nothing selfish about his lying and his
crimes.</p>

<p>"I have told you all that I can," she whispered, "but if you
hurried, you could catch the <i>New York</i> to-night&mdash;and
I think I should advise you to go."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch36"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

<p class="first">FISCHER, on leaving his unsuccessful dinner
party, drove direct to the residence of Mr. Max H. Bookam, in
Fifth Avenue. The butler who admitted him looked a little blank
at his inquiry.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bookam was expected home yesterday, sir," he announced.
"He has not arrived, however."</p>

<p>"Has there been any telegram from him?&mdash;any news as to
the cause of his non-return?" Fischer persisted.</p>

<p>"I believe that Mr. Kaye, his secretary, has some
information, sir," the man admitted. "Perhaps you would like to
see him."</p>

<p>Fischer did not hesitate, and was conducted at once to the
study in which Mr. Bookam was wont to indulge in various
nefarious Stock Exchange adventures. The room was occupied on
this occasion by a dejected-looking young man, with pasty face
and gold spectacles. The apartment, as Fischer was quick to
notice, showed signs of a strange disorder.</p>

<p>"Where's Mr. Bookam?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>The young man walked to the door, shook it to be sure that it
was closed, and came back again. His tone was ominous, almost
dramatic.</p>

<p>"In the State Prison at &mdash;&mdash;, sir," he
announced.</p>

<p>"What for?" Fischer demanded, breathing a little thickly.</p>

<p>"I have no certain information," the secretary replied, with
a noncommittal air. "All I know is that I had a long-distance
telephone to burn certain documents, but before I could do so
the room and the house were searched by New York detectives,
whose warrant it was useless to resist."</p>

<p>"But what's the charge against Mr. Bookam?"</p>

<p>"It's something to do with the disasters in&mdash;&mdash;,"
the young man confided. "The Governor of the State, who is Mr.
Bookam's cousin, is in the same trouble.... Better sit down a
moment, sir. You're looking white."</p>

<p>Mr. Fischer threw himself into an easy-chair. He felt like a
man who has built a mighty piece of machinery, has set it
swinging through space, and watches now its imminent collapse;
watches some tiny but ghastly flaw, pregnant with disaster,
growing wider and wider before his eyes.</p>

<p>"What papers did the police take away with them?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"There wasn't very much for them," the secretary replied.
"There was a list of the names of the proposed organisation
which, owing to your very wise intervention, was never formed.
There was a list of factories throughout the United States in
which munitions are being made, with a black mark against those
holding the most important contracts. And there was a letter
from Governor Roughton."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bookam hasn't drawn any cheques lately for large
amounts?" Fischer inquired eagerly.</p>

<p>"There are three in his private cheque-book, sir, the
counterfoils of which are not filled in," was the somewhat
dreary admission.</p>

<p>Fischer groaned as he received the news.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea about those cheques?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," the other acknowledged, "that Mr. Bookam was
not very discreet. I reminded him of your advice&mdash;that the
money should be passed through Sullivan&mdash;but he didn't seem
to think it worth while."</p>

<p>"Look here, let me know the worst at once," Fischer insisted.
"Do you believe that any one of those cheques was made payable
to any of the men who are under arrest?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid," the secretary declared sadly, "that the
proceeds of one were found on the person of Ed. Swindles,
intact."</p>

<p>Fischer sat for a moment with his head buried in his hands.
"That any man could have been such a fool. An organisation would
have been a thousand times safer. Max Bookam was only a very
worthy and industrious clothing manufacturer, with an intense
love for the Fatherland and a great veneration for all her
institutions. What he had done, he had done whole-heartedly but
foolishly. He was a man who should never have been trusted for a
moment in the game. After all, the pawns count...."</p>

<p>Fischer took his leave and reached his hotel a little before
midnight. Already he had begun to look over his shoulder in the
street. He found his rooms empty with a sense of relief, marred
by one little disappointment. Nikasti was to have been there to
bid him farewell&mdash; Nikasti on his way back to Japan. He
ascertained from the office of the hotel that there had been no
telephone message or caller. Then he turned to his
correspondence, some presentiment already clutching at his
strained nerves. There was a letter in a large envelope, near
the bottom of the pile, addressed to him in Nikasti's fine
handwriting. He tore open the envelope, and slow horror seized
him as he realised its contents. A long photograph unrolled
itself before his eyes. The first few words brought confusion
and horror to his sense. His brain reeled. This was defeat,
indeed! It was a photograph of that other autograph letter. The
one which he had given to Nikasti to carry to Japan lay&mdash;
gross sacrilege!&mdash; about him in small pieces. There was no
other line, no message, nothing but this damning proof of his
duplicity.</p>

<p>A kind of mental torture seized him. He fought like a caged
man for some way out. Every sort of explanation occurred to him
only to be rejected, every sort of subterfuge, only to be cast
aside with a kind of ghastly contempt. He felt suddenly stripped
bare. His tongue could serve him no more. He snatched at the
telephone receiver and rang up the number for which he searched
eagerly through the book.</p>

<p>"Is that the office of the American Steamship Company?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What time will the <i>New York</i> sail?"</p>

<p>"In three-quarters of an hour. Who's speaking?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Oscar Fischer. Keep anything you have for me."</p>

<p>He threw down the receiver for fear of a refusal, packed a
few things feverishly in a dressing bag, dashed the rest of his
correspondence into his pocket, and with the bag in one hand,
and an overcoat over the other arm, he hastened out into the
street. He was obliged at first to board a street car.
Afterwards he found a taxicab, and drove under the great wooden
shed as the last siren was blowing. He hurried up the gangway, a
grim, remorseful figure, a sense of defeat gnawing at his heart,
a bitter, haunting fear still with him even when, with a shriek
of the tugs, the great steamer swung into the river. He was
leaving forever the work to which he had given so much of his
life, leaving it a fugitive and dishonoured. The blaze of
lights, the screaming of the great ferry-boats, all the
triumphant, brazen noises of the mighty city, sounded like a
requiem to him as in the darkest part of the promenade deck he
leaned over the railing and nursed his agony, the supreme agony
of an ambitious man&mdash;failure.</p>

<h2><a id="ch37"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>

<p class="first">"WHAT has become," Mrs. Theodore Hastings asked
her niece one afternoon about a month later, "of your delightful
friend, Mr. Lutchester?"</p>

<p>Pamela laid down her book and looked across at her aunt with
wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, I thought you didn't like him, aunt?"</p>

<p>"I cannot remember saying so, my dear," Mrs. Hastings
replied. "I had nothing against the man himself. It was simply
his attitude with regard to some of your uncle's plans, of which
we disapproved."</p>

<p>Pamela nodded. They were seated on the piazza of the
Hastings' country house at Manchester.</p>

<p>"I see!... And uncle's plans," she went on reflectively,
"have become a little changed, haven't they?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Hastings coughed.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt," she admitted, "that your Uncle Theodore
was inveigled into supporting, to a certain extent, a party
whose leaders have shown themselves utterly irresponsible. The
moment these horrible things began to come out, however, your
uncle finally cut himself loose from them."</p>

<p>"Very wise of him," Pamela murmured.</p>

<p>"Who could have believed," Mrs. Hastings demanded, "that men
like Oscar Fischer, Max Bookam and a dozen other well-known and
prominent millionaires, would have stooped to encourage the
destruction of American property and lives, simply through blind
devotion to the country of their birth. I could understand," she
went on, "both your uncle and I perfectly understood that their
sympathies were German rather than English, but we shared a
common belief that notwithstanding this they were Americans
first and foremost. It was in this belief that your uncle was
led into temporary association with them."</p>

<p>"Bad luck," Pamela sighed. "I am afraid it hasn't done Uncle
Theodore any good."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hastings went on with her knitting for a moment.</p>

<p>"My child," she said, "it has probably imperilled, if it has
not completely ruined, one of the great hopes which your uncle
and I have sometimes entertained. We are both of us, however,
quite philosophical about it. Even at this moment I am convinced
that if these men had acted with discretion, and been content to
wield political influence rather than to have resorted to such
fanatical means, they would have represented a great power at
the next election. As things are, I admit that their cause is
lost for the time. I believe that your uncle is contemplating an
early visit to England. He is of the opinion that perhaps he has
misunderstood the Allied point of view, and he is going to study
matters at first hand."</p>

<p>Pamela nodded.</p>

<p>"I think he is very wise, aunt," she declared. "I quite
expect that he will come back a warm advocate of the Allies. No
one would have a ghost of a chance who went to the country here
on the other ticket."</p>

<p>"I believe that that is your uncle's point of view," Mrs.
Hastings assented.... "Why don't you ask Mr. Lutchester down for
a couple of days?"</p>

<p>"If you mean it, I certainly will," Pamela agreed.</p>

<p>"Quite incidentally," her aunt continued, "I heard the nicest
possible things about him in Washington. Lady Ridlingshawe told
me that the Lutchesters are one of the oldest families in
England. He is a cousin of the Duke of Worcester, and is
extraordinarily well connected in other directions. I must say
he has a most distinguished appearance. A well-bred Englishman
is so different from these foreigners."</p>

<p>Pamela laid down her book and drew her writing block towards
her.</p>

<p>"I'll write and invite him down at once," she suggested.</p>

<p>"Your uncle will be delighted," Mrs. Hastings purred....</p>

<p>Lutchester received his invitation in New York and arrived in
Manchester three days later. Pamela met him at the station with
a couple of boatmen by her side.</p>

<p>"If you wouldn't mind sailing home?" she proposed. "The house
is practically on an island, and the tide is just right. These
men will take your luggage."</p>

<p>They walked down to the little dock together.</p>

<p>Pamela talked all the time, but Lutchester was curiously
tongue-tied.</p>

<p>"You'll find Uncle Theodore, and aunt, too, most amusing,"
she confided. "It is perfectly obvious that there is nothing
uncle regrets so much as his temporary linking up with Fischer
and his friends; in fact, he is going to Europe almost at
once&mdash;I am convinced for no other reason than to give him
an excuse, upon his return, for blossoming out as a fervent
supporter of the Allies."</p>

<p>"Are you going too?" Lutchester inquired. "Shall I? Well, I
am not really sure," she declared, as they reached the little
wooden dock. "I suppose I shall, especially if I can find
something to do. I may even turn nurse."</p>

<p>"You will be able to find plenty to do," he assured her. "If
nothing else turns up, you can help me."</p>

<p>They stepped on to the yacht. Pamela, a radiant vision in
white, with white flannel skirt, white jersey and
tam-o'-shanter, took the helm, and was busy for a few moments getting clear. Afterwards she leaned back amongst the cushions, with Lutchester by her side.</p>

<p>"In the agitation of missing that buoy," he reminded her,
"you forgot to answer my last suggestion."</p>

<p>"Is there any way in which I could help you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You can help me in the greatest of all ways," he replied
promptly. "You can give me just that help which only the woman
who cares can give to the man who cares for her, and if that
isn't exciting enough," he went on, after a moment's pause,
"well, I dare say I can find you some work in the censor's
department."</p>

<p>"Isn't censoring a little dull?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Then you choose&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her hand slipped into his. A little breeze filled their sails
at that moment. The wonderful blue water of the bay sparkled
with a million gleams of sunshine. Lutchester drew a great
breath of content.</p>

<p>"That's aunt on the landing-stage, watching us through her
glasses," Pamela pointed out, making a feeble attempt to
withdraw her hand.</p>

<p>"It will save us the trouble," he observed, resisting her
effort, "of explanations."</p>

<p>Lutchester found his host and hostess unexpectedly friendly.
They even accepted with cheerful philosophy the news that
Lutchester's work in America was almost finished for the time,
and that Pamela was to accompany him to Europe almost
immediately. After dinner, when the two men were left at the
table, Hastings became almost confidential.</p>

<p>"So far as regards the sympathies of this country, Mr.
Lutchester," he said, "the final die has been cast within the
last few weeks. There has always been," he proceeded, "a certain
irritation existing between even the Anglo-Saxon Americans and
your country. We have fancied so often that you have adopted
little airs of superiority towards us, and that your methods of
stating your intentions have not always taken account of our own
little weaknesses. Then America, you know, loves a good fight,
and the Germans are a wonderful military people. They were
fighting like giants whilst you in England were still slacking.
But it is Germany herself, or rather her sons and friends, who
have destroyed her chances for her. Fischer, for instance," he
went on, fingering his wineglass. "I have always looked upon
Oscar Fischer as a brilliant and far-seeing man. He was one of
those who set themselves deliberately to win America for the
Germans. A more idiotic bungle than he has made of things I
could scarcely conceive. He has reproduced the diplomatic
methods which have made Germany unpopular throughout the world.
He has tried bullying, cajolery, and false-hood, and last of all
he has plunged into crime. No German-American will henceforth
ever have weight in the counsels of this country. I do not mind
confessing," Mr. Hastings continued, as he himself filled his
guest's glass and then his own, "that I myself was at one time
powerfully attracted towards the Teuton cause. They are a nation
wonderful in science, wonderful in warfare, with strong and
admirable national characteristics. Yet they are going to lose
this war through sheer lack of tact, for the want of that
kindliness, that generosity of temperament, which exists and
makes friends in nations as in individuals. The world for
Germany, you know, and hell for her enemies!... But I am keeping
you."</p>

<p>Lutchester drank his wine and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Pamela is sitting on the rocks there," Mr. Hastings
observed. "I think that she wants to sail you over to Misery
Island. We get some unearthly meal there at ten o'clock and come
back by moonlight. It is a sort of torture which we always
inflict upon our guests. My wife and I will follow in the
launch."</p>

<p>"To Misery Island!" Lutchester repeated.</p>

<p>His host smiled as he led the way to the piazza steps. Pamela
had already stepped into the boat, and with the help of a
boatman was adjusting the sail. She waved her hand gaily and
pointed to the level stretch of placid water, still faintly
brilliant in the dying sunlight.</p>

<p>"You think that we shall reach Misery Island before the tide
turns?" she called out.</p>

<p>Lutchester stepped lightly into the boat and took the place
to which she pointed.</p>

<p>"I am content," he said, "to take my chance."</p>
