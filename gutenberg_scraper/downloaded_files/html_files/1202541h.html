<b>01. Motu Water Carrier, Port Moresby</b></p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="preface" id="preface"></a>PREFACE</h2>
<p>For years past, when perusing the account of exploring expeditions setting
out for some country comparatively unknown, I always noticed with a pang of
disappointment that, however carefully the scientific staff was chosen, it was,
as a rule, considered sufficient to supply one of the members with a mahogany
camera, lens, and chemicals to take pictures, the dealer furnishing these
articles generally initiating the purchaser for a couple or three hours' time
into the secrets and tricks of the "dark art," or when funds were too limited
to purchase instruments, it was taken for granted that enough talent existed
among the members to make rough sketches, which would afterwards be "worked up"
for the purpose of illustrating perhaps a very important report.</p>
<p>Sir Samuel Baker remarks, in the Appendix to one of his Works, that a
photographer should accompany every exploring expedition. The only one I ever
heard of being furnished with that commodity was H.M.S. "Challenger," on her
scientific cruise round the world, but I remember reading in the "Photographic
News" the complaint of a gentleman, that so many years had already passed, and
still there was no sign of the "Challenger" photographs ever becoming
accessible to the public.</p>
<p>How this is, or why it should be so, is difficult to tell, but as yet no
book of travel, entirely illustrated by artistic views and portraits taken
direct from nature, has come under my notice. According to my belief, there can
be but one reason for it, and that is the difficulties encountered to find a
competent artist photographer willing to join an expedition are greater than
those necessary to secure the services of someone who can sketch, and hence
artistic photography, the legitimate and proper means to show friends at home
what these foreign lands and their inhabitants really look like, is set aside
for drawings, either partly or purely imaginary.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* Though this book was written and the pictures taken under this
impression, I found, on arrival in England, that several works of travel
illustrated by photography have been published. I had the pleasure of meeting
Mr. John Thomson, F.R.G.S., of Grosvenor Street, who showed me his magnificent
and interesting work on "China and its Peoples." I examined also Sir Lepel
Griffin's clever work, "Famous Monuments of Central India," and a little book
on Tahita, by Lady Brassey, ably illustrated by Col. H. Stuart-Wortley. The
illustrations in these Works consist without exception of photographs printed
in autotype, and the inspection of these books and their pictures at once put
me face to face with the countries described and their inhabitants, far more
vividly than could works illustrated by wood engravings, where, for truth, the
reader depends firstly on the individual conception of the artist, and secondly
on the skill of the engraver.]</blockquote>
<p>Ever since I first passed through Torres Straits in September, 1868, I
conceived an ardent desire to become personally acquainted with those
mysterious shores of Papua and their savage inhabitants. I travelled this route
on board a Dutch sailing vessel, and weird indeed were the tales that
circulated among the crew concerning the land whose towering mountain ranges
were dimly visible on our northern horizon. But years passed by, and time had
almost effaced the impression, until I made the acquaintance of Signor L. M.
D'Albertis, the intrepid Italian, who explored the Fly River higher up than
anyone has ventured since. This occurred in 1873. Signor D'Albertis visited the
Clarence River, in New South Wales, where I lived for many years, by way of
recruiting his health after his voyages to N. W. New Guinea. How I fretted that
circumstances prevented me from accompanying him on his first trip in the
"Newa," and how I envied young Wilcox (the son of a well known Naturalist
residing on the Clarence) being engaged as assistant collector, no one knows
but myself. Again some years elapsed, and when next I met D'Albertis it was at
Melbourne, in 1878. His personal reminiscences, and subsequently the reading of
his interesting work, powerfully awakened my desire again for a trip to New
Guinea. But circumstances were still adverse, and it was only when rumours of
annexation became rife, and the Rev. Mr. Lawes visited Melbourne early in 1885,
that the prospect of visiting the land of my dreams began to assume a more
tangible form.</p>
<p>Mr. Lawes, hearing me speak so enthusiastically about my long cherished
desire, assured me of his readiness to assist, and of hospitality, should I
come to Port Moresby. The reverend gentleman's kindness and goodwill were amply
proved, as my narrative will show, but be it here recorded, with due deference,
I believe he doubted at that time the likelihood of ever seeing me sit at his
table in the broad verandah of the mission house, listening to Mr. H. C.
Forbes' reminiscences of the interior of Sumatra (the exhumation and ultimate
fate of "that Kubu woman" to wit).</p>
<p>A month or so after Mr. Lawes' departure from Australia, the papers reported
the intelligence that Sir Peter Scratchley had been appointed High Commissioner
for the Protectorate of New Guinea, and that a properly equipped expedition was
to be sent to investigate the newly acquired territory. Now or never was my
chance. Colonel F. T. Sargood kindly introduced me to Sir Peter, I offered to
accompany the expedition as a volunteer, finding myself in every requisite, and
giving copies of the pictures I should succeed in taking in return for my
passage and the necessary facilities to develop and finish my negatives on
board.</p>
<p>My offer was accepted by Sir Peter, and on July 15th, 1885, I received
notice to join the "Governor Blackall," the vessel selected for the expedition,
then lying in Sydney Harbour.</p>
<p>The command of the "Governor Blackall" was entrusted to Captain T. A. Lake,
the senior captain of the A. S. N. Company's fleet, who, throughout the voyage,
sustained his high character as a skilful navigator among coral reels, and
proved himself a man of tact and decision, qualities that were more than once
put to the test during our cruise. Before launching into the description of the
expedition, I wish to record here my deep sense obligation to the gentlemen who
kindly aided in the production of this Work by contributing chapters of
valuable information. In the first place my thanks are due to the Rev. James
Chalmers, who kindly continued the thread of the narrative, and brought it to a
conclusion, when I was obliged to leave the expedition at Samarai (Dinner
Island) about a month before the lamented death of Sir Peter Scratchley. I am
also greatly indebted for his interesting paper on "The Manners and customs of
the Papuans." On that subject no better source of information than him could be
found. To Mr. G. S. Fort I offer my best thanks for presenting me with his
Official Report of the Expedition. The same recognition is due to Sir Edward
Strickland, the President of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia, for
the permission to embody in my journal the interesting account of the "Bonito"
Expedition, undertaken under the auspices of the Royal Geographical Society
almost simultaneously with ours. My appeal to Mr. Edelfeld, now exploring in
Motu Motu, met with a ready response from that gentleman in the shape of
travelling experiences in the neighbourhood of Mount Yule.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, I have to thank my learned countryman and friend. Sir
Ferdinand Baron Von M&uuml;ller, the eminent Botanist, for the promise of a
valuable essay from his pen, although, unhappily, the pressure of departmental
work on his hands is at present so severe that his contribution cannot be ready
for this, the first edition of my book; and I cannot conclude without
acknowledging my indebtedness to Commander H. Field, of H. M. Surveying
Schooner "Dart," and to his able officers, Lieutenants Messum and Dawson, not
forgetting Dr. Luther, who, with their uniform kindness and courtesy, made my
return journey on board that vessel a perfect pleasure trip.</p>
<p>J. W. LINDT.<br>
Melbourne, 1887.</p>
<p>P.S.--With regard to the publication of this Work much credit is due to Mr.
Bird, of the Autotype Company. Arriving as I did, a stranger in London, this
gentleman materially lightened my labours by introducing me to Messrs.
Longmans, the publishers, and contributing his experience freely. My thanks are
also due to Mr. Sawyer and his clever staff, for the masterly reproduction of
my pictures, upon which the success of the book mainly depends.</p>

<h3><i>Geographical Position.</i></h3>
<p>New Guinea, the latest addition to the magnificent Colonial empire now owned
by Great Britain, is the largest island on our globe, counting Australia as a
sixth continent. It lies to the north of Australia, from which it is separated
by a narrow strait named after Torres, a Spanish navigator, who, in 1606,
sailed through it on his way from the New Hebrides to the Philippine
Islands.</p>
<p><i>First Discoverers.</i>&mdash;It is doubtful whether anything relating to
this large island was known to the European world before the time of Columbus.
No mention of it is found in the works of any of the ancient geographers. The
earliest reference to it that can be traced is given in the narrative of their
voyages and adventures left by two Portuguese navigators, Francisco Sorrani and
Antonio d'Abreu, who in 1511 saw and described a portion of the south-west
coast. In the absence of any fuller information on the subject, the honour of
discovering New Guinea falls to these two adventurers. Fifteen years later
another Portuguese navigator, Don Jorges Menenes, was voyaging Malacca to the
Moluccas, and encountering a storm, was driven out of his course to the
eastward, and came upon the great island, where, finding a safe and convenient
harbour, he remained for a month to refit his shattered vessel. He named the
island Papua, a Malayan expression for black or curly hair, which is a very
marked feature of the native population. Under that name New Guinea is shown on
a chart published in Venice in 1554. Another Portuguese mariner visited the
island in 1528, and gave it the high sounding title of the Isla del Oro, or
Island of Gold, from a belief that it abounded in the precious metals. But the
honour of giving the island the name it will bear permanently falls to Inigo de
Retez, a Spanish sailor, who in 1545 sailed 250 miles along the northern
coasts, and, thinking that he saw in the appearance of the country a
resemblance to the Guinea coast on the west of Africa, called it Nueva Guinea.
The next we hear of the place is an account given by Torres of the southern
portion and its inhabitants, whom he describes as being "dark in colour, naked
except having some clothing round the middle, and armed with clubs and darts
ornamented with tufts of feathers." Schouten, a Dutch navigator, discovered
some volcanoes in the island in 1616. Twenty-seven years later Abel Janez
Tasman, the greatest of the Dutch navigators and the discoverer of Tasmania
(which he named Van Dieman's Land) and of New Zealand, visited and minutely
examined a portion of the west coast. On the New Year's Day of the year 1700,
William Dampier, the prince of English maritime adventurers, voyaging in quest
of new lands, sighted New Guinea, and never left it until he had sailed
completely round it, although his vessel (named the "Roebuck") was both old and
leaky. His account of the place and people is very racily written, and was
probably read by De Foe before he wrote "Robinson Crusoe." "The natives," he
says, "are very black; their short hair is dyed of various colours&mdash;red,
white, and yellow: they have broad, round faces with great bottle-noses, yet
agreeable enough, except that they disfigure themselves by painting and wearing
great things through their noses, as big as a man's thumb and about four inches
long. They have also great holes in their ears, wherein they stuff such
ornaments as in their noses." The illustrious navigator, Cook, rediscovered
Torres Strait in 1772, and added much to the previous knowledge of the island
and its inhabitants. In 1828 the Dutch took possession of the western portion
and attempted to make a settlement there, but failed. In 1843 Captain
Blackwood, in H.M.S. "Fly," discovered the river, which he named after his
ship. Subsequently, Captain Owen Stanley, in the "Rattlesnake," made a rough
survey of a great portion of the coast, and in 1873 Captain Moresby, in the
"Basilisk," completed our knowledge of the external form and dimensions of New
Guinea.</p>
<p><i>First Explorers.</i>&mdash;Up till very recently the only information
possessed by the civilised world respecting the island and its inhabitants
amounted to little more than that the people were negroes, and that beautiful
birds of paradise were to be found there. Alfred Wallace, the distinguished
naturalist, was the first European that gave the world a larger knowledge of
the native population and the natural productions. After him came Dr. Mickluoho
Maclay, in 1871. He lived with the natives for fifteen months, enduring the
severest privations and risking his life in the cause of science. But amongst
the explorers of New Guinea pre-eminence must be given to Signor D'Albertis,
who, in 1872, in company with his fellow-countryman. Dr. Beccari, penetrated
into the interior in many directions, and made himself intimately acquainted
with the names and habits of the natives. At various subsequent times Signor
D'Albertis continued his explorations and observations, the results of which he
has given to the world in two handsome volumes beautifully illustrated. This
distinguished Italian is a born explorer. He is possessed with the true spirit
of martyrdom in the cause of science. His pluck, perseverance and patience,
seem only to grow with the difficulties he has to encounter, and the obstacles
he has to overthrow. His personal privations and sufferings wring from him no
complaints; and he merely records them in his simple matter-of-fact manner as
among the facts and incidents of the time, and as affording an insight into the
ideas and ways of the natives in view of such circumstances. A German explorer,
Dr. A. J. Meyer, made some important additions to our knowledge of the country
by explorations, vigorously prosecuted in 1873. Dr. Beccari, alone, went on an
expedition into the interior in 1875, and returned with a large and valuable
collection of specimens of the flora and fauna of the island.</p>
<p><i>The Missionaries.</i>&mdash;Those active pioneers of civilisation, the
English missionaries, have not neglected New Guinea; but their work amongst the
natives has been seriously hindered by the unhealthiness of the country and
climate. The Rev. S. McFarlane was appointed by the Directors of the London
Missionary Society to establish a mission in the island in 1870. With him was
associated the Rev. Mr. Murray; and subsequently the Rev. W. G. Lawes and the
Rev. James Chalmers joined the mission. The labours of these gentlemen amongst
the native population have been of a quite heroic kind; and to them is mainly
due the merit of taking possession of the country for the British people. At
the hourly risk of their lives they have carried on their apostolic labours,
facing a thousand dangers, overcoming a thousand difficulties, unwearied in
their high purpose of civilising and Christianising this savage people. They
have established primary school training institutions, for native teachers,
schools for teaching the industrial arts, mission stations at many points along
the coast, and churches with regular congregations and enrolled members. A real
triumph of missionary achievement was witnessed at the mission station on
Murray Island on the 14th May, 1885, when the 15-ton mission yacht, Mary, was
launched from the yard of the Papuan industrial school, amid great feasting and
rejoicing. The wood for the little vessel had been cut, and the building of it
was executed by the hands of the pupils of the school under the supervision of
the Rev. Mr. McFarlane. The yacht is intended for missionary work in and about
the Fly River.</p>

<b>03. Portraits of the Revs. S. McFarlane, G. W. Lawes, and James
Chambers</b></p>
<p><i>Dutch Settlement.</i>&mdash;So far as is known, the Dutch, as already
stated, were the first European nation to attempt settlement in New Guinea. In
1828 Captain Steenboom, in the ship "Triton," landed on the island and took
possession in the name of the Dutch Government of the territory extending from
the 141st parallel of E. longitude westward to the sea. He built a fort at a
place he called Triton Bay, on the N.W. coast, the scenery around which was
very beautiful. But (as a Dutch gentleman at Macassar told Wallace) the officer
left in charge of the settlement, finding the life there insufferably
monotonous, killed the cattle and other live stock, and reported that they had
perished through the unhealthiness of the place, and that, besides, the natives
were very fierce and intractable. The settlement at Triton Bay was on this
account abandoned. Seven years later another Dutch commander surveyed what was
then called the Dourga River, and found it to be a strait, ninety miles long,
dividing Frederic Henry Island from the mainland. The Dutch still hold nominal
possession of the territory proclaimed by Captain Steenboom, but practically
the acquisition is of no value to them.</p>
<p><i>English Surveys of the Coast.</i>&mdash;The southern shores of New Guinea
have been mostly surveyed by British ships. Captain Blackwood, in H.M.S. "Fly,"
discovered in 1843 the river which he named after his ship. The next English
commander that surveyed part of New Guinea was Captain Owen Stanley, who, in
1847, in H.M.S. "Rattlesnake," sketched a large extent of the coast and marked
off a number of mountains, one of which, called after him, is over 13,000 feet
high. In 1873 Captain Moresby, in the "Basilisk" discovered and named Port
Moresby, and determined the form of the south-eastern extremity of the island.
Hoisting the Queen's flag he took possession in her Majesty's name, by right of
discovery, of Moresby Island and the surrounding archipelago.</p>
<p><i>Attempts at Australian Settlement.</i>&mdash;The Australian colonists
have not been wholly indifferent to the probable advantages to be gained from
effecting a settlement in New Guinea. During the past twenty years several
expeditions have been either planned or partially executed with that object,
and the Imperial Government has been again and again asked to take action for
the establishment of a British occupation of the territory. To these requests
unfavourable answers were given, although it was known at the Colonial Office
that so long back as 1793 the island had been formally annexed to Great
Britain. In that year, two commanders in the service of the East India Company,
William Bampton, Master of the "Hormuzeer," and Matthew B. Alt, Master of the
"Chesterfield," were exploring in these waters; and on the 10th July an armed
party of forty-four men from the two vessels, under the command of Dell, chief
mate of the "Hormuzeer," landed on Darnley Island in Torres Strait, and took
possession of that island and the neighbouring island of New Guinea in the name
of His Majesty King George the Third. All the formalities customary on such
occasions&mdash;hoisting the union jack, reading the proclamation, and firing a
volley&mdash;were duly observed on this occasion. Nevertheless, it was not
until nearly a century had elapsed that the imperial authorities at Downing
Street condescended to take notice of the fact that there was such a place as
New Guinea in existence.</p>
<p><i>Annexation by Queensland.</i>&mdash;The fact was forced upon their
attention by the spirited action of the Premier of Queensland, Sir Thomas
McIlwraith, who, weary of the rebuffs repeatedly inflicted on the Australian
colonists by the colonial office in regard to this matter, patriotically
resolved upon annexing New Guinea on his own authority. Accordingly he
instructed Mr. H. M. Chester, at that time police-magistrate at Thursday
Island, to proceed to the great island, and take possession in the name of Her
Majesty the Queen, of all that portion of it which was not claimed by the
Netherlands Government. In obedience to these instructions Mr. Chester sailed
for New Guinea; and, on the 4th April, 1883, he performed the ceremony of
formal annexation of all that part of the territory lying between the 141st and
the 155th meridians of east longitude. These facts were duly reported to the
Imperial authorities, and strong representations were made to them by the
Governments of the United Colonies to induce them to endorse with their
approval the action of the Queensland Premier.</p>
<p><i>Refusal of Imperial Sanction.</i>&mdash;But Lord Derby, who then held
rule in the Colonial Office, was adverse. He addressed a despatch to the
officer administering the Government of Queensland, Sir A. H. Palmer, formally
refusing to sanction the act of annexation. At this time it was well known that
Germany was meditating the project of taking possession of a part, or the whole
of New Guinea; and yet Lord Derby affirmed that there appeared to be no reason
for supposing that any Foreign Power harboured such a design. His lordship
objected, moreover, to the unnecessarily vast extent, as he deemed it, of the
territory annexed by Mr. Chester. The utmost that his lordship would concede
was that possibly a protectorate might be established over the coast tribes,
under the direction of the High Commission for the Western Pacific, but
absolute annexation was quite out of the question.</p>
<p><i>Australian Colonists remonstrate.</i>&mdash;This fresh rebuff, instead of
paralysing the Australian colonists, only roused them to greater activity. Mr.
Service, Premier of Victoria, was the first to move in the matter. He asked the
Governments of the other Colonies to send delegates to an Intercolonial
Convention, at which this and other questions would be considered. The request
met with immediate and general compliance. Accordingly, the Convention
assembled in Sydney in November, 1883; all the Australasian Colonies were
represented, and the Governor of Fiji, Sir G. W. Des Voeux, was present, but
did not vote. Resolutions affirming the desirability of promptly and
effectually securing the incorporation with the British Empire of such parts of
New Guinea as were not claimed by the Netherlands Government, were unanimously
adopted.</p>
<p><i>Proposal of a British Protectorate.</i>&mdash;To such an emphatic
expression of the wishes of the Australian Colonists, Lord Derby could not be
indifferent. In May of the following year his lordship addressed a despatch to
the Governor of Queensland, intimating that the Imperial authorities were
inclined to sanction the appointment of a High Commissioner for New Guinea,
provided that the Australian Colonies would agree to pay a subsidy of
&pound;15,000 per annum towards the expense of a protectorate. At once the two
Colonies of Queensland and Victoria offered to guarantee, between them, payment
of the whole amount, and the other Colonies subsequently consented to pay each
its quota of contribution, but upon condition that annexation was really
intended by the Imperial Government.</p>
<p><i>Annexation by Great Britain.</i>&mdash;In October, 1884, several vessels
of war on on the Australian station left Sydney Harbour one by one, bound
northwards, and on the 6th November, five British war-ships were lying at
anchor in Port Moresby. Commodore Erskine then formally proclaimed the British
Protectorate, and the British flag was hoisted with great ceremony, in the
presence of about 250 officers and men of the squadron, the missionaries, and
as many of the natives and representative chiefs as could be collected for the
occasion. All acquisition of land from the natives was forbidden, and
regulations prohibiting the introduction of alcohol and firearms were drawn up.
A representative chief, Boi Vagi, of Port Moresby, was chosen, and Mr. H.
Romilly was left as Acting Commissioner, to enforce the regulations, and to act
with authority until the arrival of the High Commissioner. Shortly afterwards
the appointment was conferred on Sir Peter Scratchley, who at once proceeded to
enter upon his duties.</p>
<p><i>Announcement of German Occupation.</i>&mdash;So far the Imperial
Authorities had complied with the wishes of the Australian Colonists, at least
in appearance. But the favour shown them was materially lessened in value by
the limitation of the area of territory taken under the British protection.
They, very naturally, desired that the whole of the island not claimed by the
Dutch should be annexed to the British Empire; but Lord Derby drew a line
across the map, bisecting the eastern half into two nearly equal parts, and
made this line the boundary of the protectorate, leaving the northern section
free to be snapped up by any Foreign Power that might choose to take it. With
reason the Colonists complained that good faith had not been kept with them,
and that their agreement to pay the subsidy of &pound;15,000 a year was
invalidated by Lord Derby's act. But his lordship refused to alter his
decision, and, unfortunately for the cause of the Colonists, New South AVales,
which had formerly been in hearty accord with all its sister Colonies in this
matter, drew off now, and stood aloof. It seemed as if the Secretary of State
for the Colonies, secretly abetted by the New South Wales Government, was bent
upon tacitly inviting some Foreign Power to take possession of the unannexed
portion of the island. Before the close of the year&mdash;as any person gifted
with the least degree of sagacity might have foreseen&mdash;the expected
claimant made his appearance on the scene. The news flashed along the electric
wires in all directions that the German flag was floating over several points
along the north-east coast of New Guinea, and on many of the adjacent islands.
Fuller information showed that the German Government had formally annexed the
whole of the territory marked off by Lord Derby as lying outside the area of
the British protectorate, together with the islands of New Britain, New
Ireland, and many others in that extensive archipelago. It must be recorded, to
vindicate the truth of history, that this intelligence caused a movement of
strong indignation in the minds of the Australian Colonists, and vigorous
protests against the action of the German Government were addressed by the
Australian Agents General to the Imperial Authorities. The feeling of
resentment was all the more keen, because the guarantee to pay &pound;15,000 a
year towards the expense of the protectorate had been given under a distinct
understanding that the whole of New Guinea, excepting the part claimed by the
Dutch, should be annexed. Lord Derby, moreover, up till the very hour of the
declaration of the German occupation, had denied all knowledge of any such
intention on the part of any Foreign Power. With reluctance the Australian
Colonists accepted the limitation of area imposed by his lordship; but it was
only their fervent loyalty to the British connexion that prevented them from
marking in a very emphatic manner their sense of what they held to be a most
unjustifiable surrender of the Imperial rights on the part of the Secretary of
State for the Colonies.</p>
<p><i>Arrival of Sir Peter Scratchley.</i>&mdash;Sir Peter Scratchley arrived
in Australia at the beginning of 1885. His first task was to secure the consent
of the several Colonial Governments to share in the payment of the stipulated
subsidy for the maintenance of the protectorate. He visited each of the
Colonies in succession, and after some demurs on the part of one or two of the
governments had been overcome, succeeded in his object. He next chartered a
fine steamer, the "Governor Blackall," from the Australian Steam Navigation
Company, and on the 20th August sailed for the seat of Government.</p>
<p><i>His First Proceedings and Premature Death.</i>&mdash;He selected Port
Moresby as his first station, living on board the "Governor Blackall," and
taking a general inspection of the surrounding locality, with a view to
selecting a fitting site for the proposed capital of the new protectorate. His
intention was to make himself thoroughly acquainted with the country before
framing any regulations for the settlement of whites within the territory. It
was with this purpose that he joined the expedition, the history of which is
narrated in the present volume, and which ended, for him, in his untimely death
from the malarial fever incident to the climate. The loss thus caused, both to
the Australian Colonies and to the Imperial Interests, was deeply felt and
universally mourned.</p>
<p><i>Appointment of a Successor.</i>&mdash;Mr. John Douglas, ex-Premier of
Queensland, was appointed by the Imperial Authorities to succeed Sir Peter
Scratchley. The new High Commissioner has set himself with characteristic
energy to carry out the purposes of his predecessor.</p>
<p><i>The German Settlement.</i>&mdash;The German government has granted a
charter to a company to promote settlement in its newly acquired possessions,
and very liberal inducements are held out to enterprising adventurers to become
the pioneers of the German Colony.</p>

in Sight</blockquote>
<p>The repeated demands of the Australasian Colonists for the annexation of New
Guinea failed, for a long period, to move the Imperial Government. The policy
of Lord Derby, when Secretary of State for the Colonies in Mr. Gladstone's
Administration, seemed to be of the Fabian order. His lordship (as Mr. Froude
told the Colonists), was in the habit of looking at both sides of a question,
and taking time to make up his mind. But somehow the march of events
outstripped Lord Derby's calm deliberation. Rumours came abroad that some great
Foreign Power was meditating the annexation of the northern island. Stimulated
to action by these reports, the patriotic Premier of Queensland, Sir Thomas
McIlwraith, resolved upon taking the matter into his own hands, and he
despatched an agent to New Guinea with orders to take possession of the
territory in the name of Her Majesty Queen Victoria. These orders were promptly
obeyed, but the patriotic act did not meet with Lord Derby's approval.</p>
<p>The annexation was disavowed in Downing Street, and the Colonial Minister
continued his tranquil meditations on both sides of the New Guinea Question. At
length Germany stepped in, and forestalled the fixed purpose of the Australian
Colonist. The larger half of the coveted territory was added to the German
possessions in the Pacific. Then Lord Derby&mdash;doubtless with a feeling of
thankfulness to Prince Bismarck for his considerateness in leaving a fragment
of the prize unappropriated&mdash;bethought him of the propriety of taking
steps to secure the interests of his own nation in the matter. His lordship
appointed an Imperial Special Commissioner, and despatched him to Australia to
obtain the funds requisite for establishing and maintaining a British
Protectorate over Southern New Guinea and the adjacent Archipelago.</p>
<p>Sir Peter Scratchley, the newly-appointed Commissioner, set forth upon his
mission, and arrived in Melbourne at the close of the year 1884. His first task
was to procure a vessel to convey him to his destination, and also suitable for
a floating vice-regal residence, pending the erection of a palace on shore. His
next business was to obtain from the several Australian Governments
contributions towards the salary and expenses of the Special Commissioner. This
object was gained without any difficulty, although there was a good deal of
grumbling at Lord Derby's remissness in allowing Germany to steal a march upon
him. But, as matters could not now be remedied, the Colonial Premiers, one and
all, agreed to share jointly the expenses of the Protectorate, and the Premier
of New South Wales, in addition, offered the use of H.M.C.S. "Wolverene," then
stationed in Sydney Harbour, for a six months' service on the New Guinea coast.
This offer the Commissioner gladly accepted; but just then, as it happened,
reports were raised of an impending rupture of friendly relations between Great
Britain and Russia, and the "Wolverene" would, in case of that event occurring,
be required for purposes of local defence. Instead of continuing his efforts to
procure another vessel, Sir Peter Scratchley devoted his attention to the
condition of the colonial defences, most of which had been constructed under
his own supervision. Happily, the Russian scare speedily subsided, and tenders
were called for from shipowners possessing a vessel suitable for the New Guinea
service. The tender of the Australasian Steam Navigation Company, for the use
of the S.S. "Governor Blackall," was accepted, this vessel lying then in Sydney
Harbour, undergoing repairs and refitting.</p>

<br>
<b>04. "The Start." Sir Peter Scratchley, his Staff and Party of Friends, S.S.
"Governor Blackall"</b></p>
<p>By the end of July, 1885, everything was in readiness for a start; but
another fortnight's delay occurred through the sudden illness of the
Commissioner. His health restored, Sir Peter Scratchley gave orders to Captain
Lake to have steam up and all ready for the voyage by half-past eight on the
morning of Saturday, 15th August. It was with no little joy and pride that I
shipped my personal baggage and apparatus, and enrolled myself as a member of
the Expedition. It seemed to me that a goal I had long been striving to reach
was now in sight, and that I was fortunate enough not only to obtain
exceptional facilities for seeing a country whose physical peculiarities, and
the manners and customs of whose inhabitants had hitherto been little known and
imperfectly described, but to be the humble means of communicating truthful
information to others. A large party of friends came on board to take a
farewell breakfast, and to accompany us down the beautiful harbour. We rounded
H.M.S. "Nelson," and the band on board that vessel struck up "Auld Lang Syne"
by way of parting salute. A number of small steamers were conveying the men
garrisoned in the various forts and batterie to a grand review that was to come
off that day, and the men, as they passed our vessel, greeted us with hearty
cheers. A little past Bradley's Head our Captain slackened speed to allow Lady
Scratchley and her children to be taken on board the launch "Gladys." I could
not help noticing that the parting between the Commissioner and his wife and
eldest daughter was touched with pathos and solemnity, as if they all felt
deeply that the enterprise in which the husband and father was engaged was not
wholly free from serious risks and dangers. Alas! it was their final parting on
earth. The younger members of the Commissioner's family, however, entertained
no misgivings. With the happy carelessness of childhood, they evidently
regarded the occasion as only a pleasant holiday, too soon brought to a close.
At length the moment for the final leave-takings came; the last affectionate
adieux were exchanged, the last tearful embraces were given and taken, the last
good wishes were spoken; the visitors were conducted on board the "Gladys;"
and, with waving of white handkerchiefs and many unspoken prayers for a
prosperous voyage and a safe return for the adventurers, they reluctantly
turned their faces in the direction of Sydney.</p>
<p>The North Head was passed at 10.40, and, steering her course North by East,
our gallant little vessel fairly entered on her mission, with a fair westerly
wind, a smooth sea, and weather of the true Australian mildness and brilliancy.
Broken Bay was speedily left behind us, and next Newcastle, famed for its coal
mines. As the sun was sinking below the horizon we found ourselves abreast of
the Port Stephens Lighthouse. The wind had freshened considerably during the
afternoon, so as to spoil the appetites of some of our party, who had not yet
found their sea-legs; the carpenter was battening down the hatches, evidently
in anticipation of a squally night, and the company generally betook themselves
to the horizontal position in their berths at an early hour of the evening.
Happily, the fears of a coming storm were not realised. About midnight the wind
fell, and the adventurers slept as calmly in their bunks as if they had been in
a palatial hotel on shore.</p>
<p>Sunday morning dawned with Sabbath stillness and brightness. After breakfast
the Commissioner issued orders for a general muster at half-past ten. The hour
appointed found every man not actually engaged on duty ranged on the
quarter-deck; the roll was called, and the Captain announced that Divine
Service would be held at eleven, that attendance was not compulsory, but that
the Commissioner would be pleased to see every man in attendance. Punctually at
eleven the bell tolled for prayers; the crew, to a man, came up on deck, the
ship then going at half-speed; prayer books and hymn books were handed round,
and then the Commissioner read with great solemnity the beautiful service of
the Church of England for those at sea, Mr. Fort leading in the reading of the
responses. The singing of the 166th hymn, in which the whole of the little
congregation heartily joined, concluded this very impressive service, and every
one of the worshippers seemed to feel that he had performed an act of devout
thankfulness to Almighty God for vouchsafing so happy a start and such fair
prospects to our expedition.</p>
<p>Once more the engines were put at full speed, and with a light wind and a
calm sea our vessel went joyfully skimming over the deep. Smoky Cape and Trial
Bay were passed before noon; the lighthouse tower on South Solitary hove in
sight; the S.S. "Birksgate" passed us on our way southward; several smaller
sailing craft were sighted, and one of them, a three-masted schooner, passed so
close under our bows that we could read her name&mdash;the
"Sarsfield"&mdash;with the naked eye.</p>
<p>Next day we breasted the Clarence Peak, a well-known landmark, at 4.15 p.m.;
and passed the Clarence River Heads at 5.30. After dinner we discerned the
lights of the camp-fires of the Custom House officers guarding the wreck of the
"Cahors," wrecked a few days before on Evans Reef, and the red light at the
Richmond River Heads showed out just as the company were "turning in." During
the night the mouths of the Tweed and Brunswick rivers were passed; Cape Byron,
the most easterly point of Australia, was rounded, and our vessel kept
thenceforward a more northerly course. The next point passed was the southern
entrance to Moreton Bay, which&mdash;it is a pity to record&mdash;has of late
years become shallower and unsafe for vessels of any size. Moreton Island, a
sandy, sterile-looking spot, was passed on the left, and at 9.45 a.m. we
breasted the lighthouse situated on the highest part of the island. Entering
the mouth of the Brisbane River, the harbour-master's steam-launch conveyed on
board Mr. Romilly, the Deputy Commissioner, and Mr. Chester, police-magistrate
at Somerset and Thursday Island, who had the honour of hoisting the British
flag at Port Moresby and taking possession of New Guinea in the name of Her
Majesty Queen Victoria. Next appeared H.M.S. "Gayndah," which had been
specially constructed for the defence of the Port, to escort us up the river,
and at 2 p.m. the "Governor Blackall" cast anchor opposite the Government
Domain.</p>
<p>At this point in our narrative it may not be unfitting to give the reader a
description of our gallant ship and the appointments made for the expedition.
The trial trip in Sydney Harbour was thus described in the "Sydney Morning
Herald" of 7th August:&mdash;</p>
<p>"About two months ago Her Majesty's High Commissioner for New Guinea, Sir
Peter Scratchley, chartered the A. S. N. Company's steamer 'Governor Blackall,'
in which to visit the different parts of the new colony over which he has been
appointed to act as the Queen's representative; and on her arrival in Sydney
she was taken over to the Company's works, and altered and improved in her
internal fittings to such an extent as to give her the appearance of a new
ship. Yesterday the steamer was taken for a trial trip, and the result was
regarded as in every way highly satisfactory. She cast off from the A.S.N.
Company's wharf at about a quarter to eleven, and proceeded down the harbour
and outside the Heads for a distance of several miles, the speed attained when
covering the measured mile being equal to eleven knots per hour. As the day was
beautifully fine, with a gentle 'north-easter,' the trip was greatly enjoyed by
the company present, among whom were Messrs. Cruickshank (chief Government
engineer-surveyor), A. B. Portus (superintendent of dredges), Gray (Mort's
Dock), Captain Vine Hall, Dr. Glanville, and others.</p>
<p>"There was but one opinion among the the company as to the suitability of
the steamer for the work in which she is to be engaged, also in reference to
the exceedingly comfortable, even luxurious manner in which she has been fitted
out. The 'Governor Blackall' is a most attractive looking vessel of 487 tons
gross register, and was built from designs supplied by Mr. Norman Selfe by
Mort's Dock and Engineering Company, in 1871, to the order of the Queensland
Government, who employed her for some years in conveying the mails along the
coast of that colony. She then came into the possession of the Australasian
Steam Navigation Company, and has been running in the coastal trade of
Queensland ever since. About five years ago the Company went to the expense of
providing her with new engines and boilers, which, with the other parts of the
ship, have been carefully overhauled and put in first class order, so that
yesterday the machinery worked very smoothly and without the slightest hitch of
any kind. On the 1st of July last the "Governor Blackall" was placed in the
hands of Mr. Cruickshank to superintend the necessary alterations and repairs,
and he has carried out his work in a very creditable manner. The hull of the
vessel, both inside and out, has been chipped, cleaned, and painted, the paint
outside being white, which certainly adds to the attractiveness of the vessel's
appearance. The old fittings in the saloon have been removed, and the apartment
has been entirely re-arranged to suit the requirements of the expedition. State
rooms running its entire length have been erected, with ample room ventilation,
and light for every member of the expedition; and the dining-table, with swing
trays overhead, runs down the centre. On the right of the companion leading to
the saloon is the apartment, formerly the ladies' cabin, to be used by Sir
Peter Scratchley as a bed and sitting-room, which is fitted up in most complete
style, and with a considerable display of taste in the furnishings, &amp;c.
Each of the officers has a separate cabin, and in addition one has been set
apart specially for the use of Mr. Lindt, the photographer to the expedition,
who has over 400 plates with him, and who intends to take views of New Guinea
to be sent home to the exhibition to be held in London next year. Then Dr.
Glanville has a room, in addition to his private cabin, for the dispensary.
There is a bath-room for the use of the general, and another for the officers,
and in each hot, cold, and shower-baths may be had at any moment, the cold
water coming from a tank on the bridge, from which the whole ship is supplied,
and the hot from the boiler. All the furniture in the cabins is quite new, and
made of beautifully polished cedar, thus adding greatly to the general effect.
The fore cabin has also been altered and improved and the petty officers and
men will find most comfortable quarters therein. The ventilation of the vessel
has been carefully studied, and a system has been adopted which has so far been
an undoubted success, and in the trying climate of New Guinea should prove a
boon to all on board. The ventilating machinery is driven by a separate engine,
to which is attached a large and powerful exhaust fan, which draws out the
heated air from all parts of the ship most effectually. There is a large pipe,
six inches in diameter, extending from one end of the ship to the other. This
is slung from the roof in the saloon and in it there are airslits at intervals,
which can be opened and shut at pleasure. As the heated or foul air rises it is
drawn into these orifices, and then through the pipe till it is sent overboard.
The steam-engine will only be required to work the system when the vessel is at
anchor in the harbour, as when she is at sea the pipe is connected with the
funnel, and an effective 'up-cast' shaft is thus created. Two of Kircaldy's
patent condensers for condensing fresh water are placed on the bridge, and on
trial proved wonderfully effective, over 1,000 gallons being obtained from them
in one day. They occupy but little room, and should prove invaluable to the
expedition. They were the only two in Sydney, and Mr. Cruickshank obtained them
as a special favour from Mr. Wildridge, the Superintendent of the E. and A.S.S.
Company. The next noticeable addition to the resources of the ship is one of
Oscar Kroff's ice-making machines, which has been tried and has been found to
work well, turning out fifteen pounds of ice every four hours. One of Sir
William Thompson's sounding machines has also been supplied to the 'Blackall,'
and in the coral seas it should be of great service. Yesterday it was tried
under the supervision of the local agent, Captain Vine Hall, and acted most
efficiently, telling the depth of water off the heads very accurately. In
addition to every requisite in a general way for the expedition, the steamer
has been provided with a complete set of spare gear in the engine-room, and an
ample supply of stores; also with a smart little steam-launch, which should
prove useful for a variety of purposes, especially for ascending shallow
rivers, &amp;c.; a Gatling gun, with a stand of small arms, including
Winchester and Martini-Henri rifles, and revolvers, and about 6,000 rounds of
ammunition; and double awnings fore and aft. What was formerly the commander's
room aft has been fitted up in a very inviting way as an extra room for General
Scratchley. The 'Governor Blackall' has been placed under the command of
Captain T. A. Lake, one of the most valued officers in the Company's service,
and there is every likelihood that under his careful and skilful supervision
the steamer will wend her way safely through the dangers which surround the
navigation of the coast of New Guinea. After the steamer returned to the
harbour she brought up in Farm Cove, where she will remain until she leaves for
her destination. She will call at Brisbane, Townsville, and Cooktown, en route
to New Guinea, probably staying a couple of days at each place."</p>
<p>From this description it will be seen that no expense was spared (as was
fitting) in adapting our vessel to the requirements of the expedition. With a
laudable purpose of lightening by innocent amusement the monotonous duties of
the seamen, and enlivening the spirits of the company generally, the
Commissioner, whilst in Brisbane, purchased a handsome stock of musical
instruments&mdash;concertinas, flutes, banjos, bones, &amp;c.&mdash;suitable
for what, in the language of the music halls, is called a "variety
entertainment." Those of the party who were musically inclined no doubt
anticipated much pleasant recreation from this new acquisition; but it may,
perhaps, be doubted whether, on the whole, the amateur performers themselves do
not win larger delight from these performances than the average of their
auditors. Another provident purchase was a set of oil-skin suits for the use of
the crew; but when, on the second day after our leaving Brisbane, the cases
containing the waterproof gear was opened, it was found that most of the suits
were rotten and quite useless. They were of all colours, from lemon yellow to
Vandyke brown, and looked very much as if they had been bought by the vendors
as salvage stock from a great fire in the warehouse. No doubt the clever
fellows thought that they had done a very smart stroke of business in thus
disposing of a case of worthless and damaged goods at the price of sound and
serviceable articles; but the Commissioner had the bad goods carefully
repacked, and re-shipped from Townsville to the <i>too</i> clever vendors.</p>
<p>Whilst at Brisbane, our vessel was constantly beset by sight-seeing
citizens, and our party equally so with "interviewing" reporters. The visitors
were treated with uniform courtesy, and they all appeared to be very much
pleased with the arrangements. Here the party was joined by Mr. H. O. Forbes,
the eminent naturalist. His instruments had been damaged at Batavia, through an
accident that sunk the lighter conveying his luggage, and he had come on to
Brisbane to get them repaired. On our starting, Mr. Forbes left behind him, to
follow by the next steamer, his Malay servant and Amboynese hunters. He spoke
to me very highly of these dusky retainers as being faithful and affectionate;
some of them were in tears at their master temporarily leaving them. This
testimony I am able to corroborate from my own experience; I have found both
the Malays and the Sundanese as servants industrious and obedient, and so long
as they are kept in their native tropical climate they are hardy and enduring;
but they cannot stand the cold, and what to an English constitution is pleasant
and bracing weather is to them severe suffering and complete collapse.</p>
<p>We left Brisbane on the 20th, at 3 p.m., the Commissioner having finished
his inspection of the fortifications. Mr. Romilly, the Deputy Commissioner,
embarked with us. He was limping a little, as I noticed, from a slightly lamed
foot. Our vessel was laden rather above the Plimsol standard, in consequence of
the quantity of coal and luggage taken on board at the city; but as this was a
defect that time would remedy, not much notice was taken of the circumstance.
It told materially, nevertheless, against the comfort of the voyagers
throughout the stormy night that followed, the ship rolling heavily in a swell
from the eastward. At nine on the morning of the 21st we passed Sandy Cape.</p>
<p>The Captain had fitted up one of Walker's Patent Taffrail Logs, to test its
accuracy. The instrument was not altogether a success; the distance from Sandy
Cape to Lady Elliot Island is seventy-two nautical miles, and the dial of the
Patent Log showed only sixty-three miles. Captain Lake ascribed the discrepancy
to the use of an unsuitable line carrying the fan, or propeller, of the log,
which error he proposed to rectify upon a second trial.</p>
<p>Lady Elliot Island was passed about six in the afternoon. This place is
merely a low stretch of coral reef, standing only a few feet above the water
level; but it bears a lighthouse, and it is of some importance geographically,
as indicating the commencement of the Great Barrier Reef. A showery day, with a
rather rough sea on, was followed by a bright and tranquil evening, so that we
looked forward to enjoying a quiet dinner and a calm night afterwards. This
anticipation, happily, was not disappointed.</p>
<p>On passing Percy Island No. 1 in the afternoon of the next day, the 22nd,
Captain Lake mentioned that he knew the place well from a tragic incident that
occurred there within his own knowledge. The captain has spent all his naval
life on these coasts, and in the year 1854&mdash;some time before the
separation of Queensland from New South Wales&mdash;the Government of Sydney
sent out an expedition to make explorations along that portion of the
territory. The party started from Brisbane in a cutter named the "Percy," and
after making an inspection of various islands they came upon the one that was
now in sight. As the place presented an inviting appearance, they all landed to
make researches, with the exception of four men, who formed the crew of the
little vessel. <i>But they never returned</i>, every one of them being murdered
by the blacks. The geologist of the party, Mr. Strange, was a personal friend
of our captain's, and the sad catastrophe was therefore stamped indelibly upon
his memory. The island bears the name of the cutter, and the recollection of
the tragedy is thus perpetuated.</p>
<p>A second trial of the taffrail log already mentioned was made on the 23rd,
with much more satisfactory results. The instrument rings a bell every quarter
of a mile traversed, and is self registering up to one hundred miles. Then the
time is taken, and the same process is repeated, the instrument requiring no
attention save oiling a couple of times a day.</p>
<p>We noticed here a peculiar yellowish scum spread over the surface of the
ocean. Upon inquiring of our skipper what the substance was, he told me that
seamen suppose it to be the spawn of the coral insect. Sometimes it is met with
in such large quantities that a landsman would think that the vessel was
running on a sandbank. The substance, whatever it may be, makes its appearance
in these waters about the beginning of August, and is rarely seen later than
December.</p>
<p>At 4 p.m. we passed Percy Island No 2, or rather, two islands divided from
one another by a narrow strait. Seen under the tinted lights of a brilliant
sunset, the place looks as lovely to the eye as Prosperos' enchanted island.
The sky was covered with those aerial "woolpacks" which the trade winds always
bring with them, and the soft shadows of the silvery clouds flecked the green
hillsides of the happy land. There is abundance of timber, pine, and grazing
ground sufficient for a few thousand sheep in all seasons. An inlet runs up to
a perfectly sheltered basin, navigable for small craft. Our second engineer had
once been driven upon this island through stress of weather, and going ashore,
he found a fine lake of fresh water, with unlimited fishing and shooting
privileges for whomsoever chose to claim them. Two or three European settlers
vegetate in calm contentment in this ideal island-pastoral solitude.</p>
<p>Pine island is the name of the adjacent small territory, and is so called
from the immense quantity of white-stemmed pine, growing right up to the summit
of the highest hills, which it contains. A lighthouse has recently been erected
here, and the cottage of the keeper, standing amidst a grove of tall graceful
pines, looks to the distant observer a charmingly romantic habitation for a
sentimental hermit. Whilst we were gazing at the house through our glasses we
caught sight of the lighthouse-keeper's wife walking up and down in the
verandah, with her baby in her arms. We waved our handkerchiefs by way of
kindly greeting, and the good woman, handing the baby to her husband, re-turned
our salute. On the side of the island which fronts the continent the cliff is
extremely steep, the rise and fall of the tide being fully twenty feet. To draw
up the building materials and stores from the landing-place on the beach the
aid of an iron-wire tramway is required.</p>
<p>I could not help thinking that this group of islands would be a most
delightful place to spend a summer holiday. Access to the place could easily be
obtained by means of a boat from the Australian Steam Navigation Company's
vessel. The islands are well sheltered, game is abundant, and the climate is
simply perfection; what other element of holiday enjoyment is needed? One of
the settlers would, no doubt, readily lend his services to the party of
excursionists, and what glorious campings out they would have! One of the group
is named Sphinx Island, from a fanciful idea of its resemblance in shape to the
fabled monster of the Egyptians.</p>
<p>During the night our skipper was busily engaged superintending the
navigation of the vessel through Whit-Sunday Passage, a narrow strait running
through an almost bewildering maze of islands. This passage is counted the most
beautiful spot in the whole extent of the Queensland coast. We cleared the
passage at six in the morning, so that we just missed feasting our eyes on the
varied loveliness of this romantic archipelago. Ever since passing Lady Elliot
Island we have had perfectly calm seas and Italian skies; the vessel skims
along the surface of the unruffled waves like a sea-bird; and one happy result
of these favourable conditions is that not a soul amongst the party is now
absent from the table at meal times.</p>
<p>Cape Upstart and Cape Bowling Green stand closely adjacent to one another,
both named from their peculiar aspects. The one rises abruptly from the sea to
a height of more than 1,000 feet; the other lies flat with the sea-level. A
vessel might very easily run aground at the latter spot, as the captain of the
S.S. "Gunga" found to his cost a few months ago, when he got stranded there.
The casualty occurred in broad daylight, and so simply, that the wife of the
lighthouse keeper, standing only a few yards inland, waved her apron to warn
the skipper of his danger.</p>
<p>Late in the evening we entered Cleveland Bay, and dropped anchor in the open
roadstead, about two miles from shore. Townsville stands upon the beach, on
both sides of Ross's Creek, and high hills, rising abruptly, enclose it all
round. I had learned from the Brisbane papers that "The Vagabond" was abroad in
Northern Queensland, and next morning, upon landing, I encountered this
particular eye of the "Melbourne Argus," looking as fresh and jolly as ever. By
Mr. Julian Thomas I was introduced to Mr. Gulliver, of Acacia Vale, who
received me very hospitably, and lent me the manuscript diary of Mr. Edelfeld,
who had been employed by him in collecting botanical specimens in New Guinea.
From the perusal of this record I gained much valuable information. Here a
small flock of about fifty sheep were bought for the use of the expedition, the
survivors of the voyage amongst the lot being reserved for pasturage at the
mission station at Port Moresby. Amongst our visitors whilst at Townsville were
Captain Sandeman and his amiable wife, who took a farewell dinner with us, and
then returned home in their smart steam launch.</p>
<p>We left Townsville at 10 p.m. on the 24th, and next day at noon were abreast
of the Johnston River, the scenery along the banks of which was described to me
by "The Vagabond" as being more beautiful than anything he had ever seen, with
the exception of the wizard Fijian streams.</p>
<p>Cooktown was reached at 9 a.m. of the 26th. The wharf here is situated at
the base of a steep hill, on the top of which stands the signalling station at
an elevation of about 500 feet. As the cliff intercepts the cool south-east
breezes, we began to experience, while lying here, the true tropical heat, the
thermometer in the saloon rising to 80&deg;. So steep is the hill, that when
the dwelling of the company's agent was being built, it was necessary to make
an excavation in the side, in order to lay the foundations. The situation of
the house exposes it to the danger of inundation from the tropical rains, but
in the dry season the fresh water required for domestic purposes has to be
carried up the steep ascent. On the opposite bank of the Endeavour River rises
the volcanic pile, Mount Sanders, its rugged slopes deeply scarred and worn by
the rains of many centuries. Cooktown wears a straggling and stagnant
appearance, in this respect contrasting strongly with Townsville. As is usual
with all the towns in Northern Queensland, galvanised corrugated iron is here
the universal building material, being so useful as a rain-catching roofing.
Walking through the town I noticed a good hospital (built on a principle that
suits it to a tropical climate) and several churches and schools. At the girls'
school the children were being taught their lessons on the shady side of the
building under the verandah. Their appearance struck me as being particularly
neat and tidy. I took two photographic views of the town, one of them from the
summit of the hill, taking in the mangrove swamps of the Lower Endeavour River.
The missionary schooner, the "Ellangowan," a very well-fitted and smart-looking
craft, lay at the wharf next to our vessel, and H.M.S. "Raven" was moored a
little way up the river, which is navigable for a short distance for smaller
craft. Chinese abound in Cooktown, and very valuable residents they are, as
they are the sole cultivators of fruit and vegetables. Scores of aboriginals
were strolling about the town, and they afforded us some amusement by the
expertness with which they dived into the river for coins. At about midnight
our last visitor from Cooktown, Mr. Milman, who had been spending the evening
with the Commissioner, left us, and the stragglers of our own party being all
brought on board, the tide serving, we weighed anchor at 1 a.m. of the 27th,
and so bade adieu to the last civilized settlement we should see until our
return from the newly-acquired territory.</p>
<p>At daybreak Cape Flattery was passed, and, about 7 o'clock, Lizard Island,
where a few years ago a party of <i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i> gatherers were
murdered by the blacks. This incident was rendered memorable by a peculiarly
tragic circumstance. Mrs. Wilson, the wife of one of the party, had accompanied
her husband on the expedition. With her baby at her breast, she contrived to
escape from the massacre, and accompanied by the Chinese cook to the party, put
to sea in a ship's tank, in the hope of saving their lives. The poor fugitives
drifted on to an island in the Howitt group, about forty miles to leeward, and
there perished from want of water. The son of our skipper, happening to touch
at this spot some months afterwards, found the skeletons of the poor mother and
her babe lying on the beach, and that of the Chinaman a little way off. Beside
the bleached remains of the mother lay a scrap of paper, upon which she had
contrived to scribble, in the midst of her prolonged agony, a rough diary of
the adventures and sufferings of herself and her companion. What unrecorded
tragedies these sunlit ocean regions have witnessed!</p>
<p>Clearing Lizard Passage, and keeping the largest island of the Lizard group
right astern, we steered straight for the mile-and-a-half opening in the Great
Barrier Reef. Our skipper here mounted to the fore-cross-trees, to keep sharp
observation of our course; nor was the precaution needless, for on both sides
of our little craft we could plainly discern the long waves breaking heavily
into foam on the coral reefs. Skilful piloting carried us safely through all
dangers; and, the Barrier Reefs once cleared, our vessel ploughed securely the
deep waters of the open Pacific, heaving into billows under the influence of
the south-east trade winds.</p>
<p>A favourable run of thirty-six hours further brought us within sight of the
shores of the island of our destination.</p>

<p>The south-east trade winds were blowing when we first sighted the shores of
New Guinea; and as, during their prevalence, a mist more or less dense hangs
about the mountain tops, we caught only a short glimpse of the towering heights
of the magnificent Owen Stanley Ranges. About noon the low-lying lands of the
fore-shore came distinctly into view. Stationed at his post of observation on
the fore-crosstrees, our skilful commander gave forth his directions for
steering the little craft securely through the labyrinth of coral reefs.
Abreast of Fisherman Island we could clearly discern the breakers flashing and
foaming on the shallows, and at one time we seemed to be in the very midst of
them. At this moment our course was easterly, and dead in the face of the heavy
swell of the ocean. Although our prudent skipper slackened speed by a full
half, before we had passed the narrows abreast of Pyramid Point the waves
dashed in glittering cascades over our bows continuously for about an hour. It
was a very wonderful sight to observe the beautiful rainbows woven by the
dazzling sun-rays upon the mounting and falling sprays, each in succession
appearing and vanishing with the speed of light. At length Paga Point was
passed, we were in smooth water, and our vessel came to anchor in the
land-locked harbour of Port Moresby. We had reached our destination.</p>

<br>
<b>05. Loading Lakatoi, Port Moresby &mdash; Women making Pottery</b></p>
<p>Our position was about a mile from the Mission Station, and close by us lay
anchored H.M. Surveying Ship the "Lark." The time being about 3 o'clock in the
afternoon, it was decided that none of the party should go ashore till next
morning. Speedily there came to welcome us Mr. Musgrave, Assistant Deputy
Commissioner, and Mr. Frank Lawes, eldest son of the missionary. News was
mutually exchanged, and Mr. Musgrave stayed to dine with the Commissioner. Next
morning our feet trod for the first time the soil of New Guinea, and we had a
very cordial welcome from the missionary and his amiable wife. Arrangements
were made by the Commissioner for an excursion on the following Monday up the
Laloki River, as far as the Rano Falls, the photographer being in charge of the
party. Then we took a first look at the native villages standing close by the
shore. They reminded us somewhat of those ancient cranoges, or lake dwellings,
once common in Scotland, Ireland, and various parts of Continental Europe.
Built upon mangrove stakes, planted something below low-water mark, each hut is
connected by a sort of rude bridge with the shelly beach. Troops of naked
Papuan children, some so young as to be barely able to stand on their tiny
limbs, frolicked fearlessly about the ricketty stages upon which the huts
stood. They had evidently no apprehension of danger from falling overboard. We
could imagine the feelings of a civilized mother at seeing her offspring
diverting themselves in such a situation: the savage matrons appeared to regard
the scene with the tranquil satisfaction of a motherly old duck which sees her
young brood taking for the first time to the water! The natives hereabouts are
an indolent and filthy race, many of them being disfigured by ugly sores on
their faces and bodies&mdash;the effects of bad and insufficient food, combined
with carelessness of the primary laws of health. This foul disease is, however,
not contagious; if it were so, the whole race would speedily perish of
scorbutic and scrofulous epidemics.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="image-06" id="id06"></a><img alt="" src=
"1202541h-images/newguinea-06.jpg"><br>
<br>
<b>06. Lakatoi, or Motu Trading Vessel, under Sail</b></p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Papuan natives of the littoral are not wanting in industry
and ingenuity. The Motu tribe is celebrated all along the coast for skill in
the manufacture of pottery, and they carry on a large trade in cooking utensils
and water jugs with the tribes living farther to the west. We saw them fitting
up their large trading canoes, or Lakatois, as they call them, which are, in
fact, a species of raft formed of five or more large trunks of the buoyant
pencil-cedar tree, hollowed out and lashed skilfully together. These huge rafts
were in various stages of completion; from twenty to forty busy workmen were in
each, fixing the lashings, and making splash-boards of lengths of thatch
composed of pandanus leaves. These leaves are gathered at certain periods when
they have attained their full growth, and are strung together in lengths
varying from 9 to 12 feet. A framework of strong saplings is first lashed right
across the huge trading vessel, projecting fore and aft about 8 feet, and 3
feet over the sides, forming, when covered with the leaves, a gangway all
round. Huts of the same tough material are erected on this base, and last of
all the mast is shipped, carrying a neat sail of a peculiar shape, like the
claw of a crab. Of course, naval structures of this kind are not well
calculated for sailing close to the wind; but the astute natives get the better
of Neptune and his laws, by taking advantage of the prevailing winds to make
their voyages annually. With the last of the south-east trades they sail
westward to the villages on the coast, and to the rivers of the Papuan Gulf,
exchanging their pottery for the rabia (sago) and other products of the region;
and after several weeks of feasting, they catch the north-west monsoons to
return homewards with their deeply laden vessels. Sometimes, on the return
voyage, half a dozen or more of the family trading canoes are lashed together,
thus forming quite a floating village, swarming with a joyous population. M.
D'Albertis mentions in his book the astonishment which these strange flotillas
caused in him. In anticipation of witnessing the starting of the Port Moresby
Armada in a few days, I made my arrangements for taking instantaneous
photographs of the Lakatois, and also of the singular mystic ceremonies which
precede the event. Meantime I was occupied with preparations for the inland
excursion. The good missionaries promised to furnish horses for the party, and
Mrs. Lawes kindly offered me her favourite mare, a handsome chestnut, with
silver mane and tail, the offspring of stock brought over by the prospecting
party some years ago.</p>
<p>The Sunday was spent quietly on board, and as the ship's bell was summoning
the voyagers to Divine service on the quarter-deck, we could hear the faint
tinkling of the bell at the Missionary Station similarly calling the dusky
worshippers to prayers. Even in savage New Guinea the blessed light of the Word
of God is gradually dispelling the darkness of barbarism and cannibalism. It is
amid such scenes as this that the Divine power of Christianity, to elevate and
dignify humanity, is most fully apprehended. Only to think of the immense arc
of moral ascent there is between a cannibal feast and a Christian
Communion!</p>
<p>Although my apparatus and weapons of defence were always at hand, I had much
trouble in making these up into portable packages for the native carriers, the
impedimenta required for even a few nights of camping out being both bulky and
heavy.</p>
<p>My assistant and myself were put on shore on Sunday afternoon, and took up
our quarters at the hospitable Mission House, prepared to make an early start
next morning. After tea, a religious service was held on the broad verandah,
for the benefit of the pupils and servants at the station. Books containing the
Gospels were handed round to the dusky worshippers, and some hymns, translated
into Motu, which was the language used in the service, by Mr. Lawes. The Motu,
like all other southern dialects, has a liquid softness and euphony of
expression that reminds one of the Malayian tongue. While Mr. Chalmers read the
prayers, the native boys and girls squatted around him, were very attentive and
decorous in their bearing, and all joined devoutly in reading the responses.
Their singing was notable for the careful manner in which they kept time and
tune together, and though the melodies chosen were of the simplest kind, they
well became the lips of those unsophisticated children of nature. Amongst the
servants, it should be mentioned, was an old native woman, whom every one
called Granny. Mrs. Lawes introduced this ancient dame to us as her Prime
Minister, without whose valuable aid and assistance the good lady would not
manage to get on very well. Granny "bosses" all hands with a wonderful amount
of tact and firmness. I presented the old dame with a gorgeous brooch, which
delighted her immensely; we shook hands, and I was repaid for my gift by a
smile that quite lighted up the grim and wrinkled face of the New Guinea
grandame.</p>

<b>07. Lakatoi near Elevala Island&mdash;Elevala Island, from Mission
Station</b></p>
<p>Anxiety about the weather, which was changeable, with sudden gusts of rain,
disturbed my rest through the night. Towards daybreak the rain abated, and
although the weather still wore an unsettled look, we resolved on making a
start, our genial host being of opinion that we should have clear skies and
gentle airs after passing the coast-range. Seated at our early breakfast, under
the verandah, the troop of native boys, who were to act as porters for the
party, made their appearance. Being a "New Chum" myself, I had left the task of
engaging these carriers, and arranging the commissariat department, to Mr.
Lawes, junior; but almost at the last moment this young gentleman was called
away on some Government service, and Mr. Hunter took his place as guide. An
experienced leader of expeditionary parties is Mr. Hunter, and was right hand
man to Captain Armit, when engaged in explorations here. There was, therefore,
every reason to place entire confidence in our new guide. Our packages were
equally distributed amongst the boys, some of whom were of the Motuan and the
others of the Koiari tribe. One of the boys at the mission station had been
told off to act as our head cook, and in virtue of this superior station he was
accorded a lighter burden than the rest.</p>

in Indian file, making straight for a steep hill rising a little way back from
the station, whilst the guide, my assistant, and myself, mounted on our steeds,
strike off on a tract leading in a northerly direction, by an easier gradient,
to a gap in the coast range. By making this little detour we spare our horses
at the outset of the journey&mdash;a most prudent precaution, as we speedily
discovered. After traversing a couple of miles of tolerably level plain,
densely covered with fine kangaroo grass, we get into a country wherein
undulations rise into ridges, ridges into hills, and hills into ranges so steep
that no horse save one thoroughly disciplined to this kind of travelling would
care to face the precipitous native paths. The intervening gullies were covered
with an almost impenetrable scrub, so that the party experienced all the
troubles as well as the delights of travelling in the Papuan "forest primeval,"
Our footmen having joined us, and Mr. Hunter leading, we traversed some of the
roughest territory it has ever been my hap to explore in the Southern
World.</p>
<p>About eleven a.m. we reached a creek fringed on both sides with wild
tropical verdure of a quite gorgeous description. Here we had an opportunity of
testing the capabilities, and noting the behaviour of our steeds. At the
crossing-place the banks were fearfully steep and slippery from the previous
night's rain; so, dismounting and slinging the bridles to the stirrup-leathers,
we let loose the horses to find their own way across, two of the boys preceding
to catch them up. I have had much experience of crossing creeks in Australia,
but all my previous trials in that way were but a pleasant diversion compared
with the present one. Our sagacious animals, freed from their riders and left
to themselves, addressed themselves to their difficult task with a serene
cautiousness that would have been admirable in the most expert explorer. Down
the almost perpendicular descent they went, step by step, carefully setting
each hoof upon some slight projection that just afforded footing, and avoiding
every stumbling block in the nature of gnarled roots and tortuous loops of
creeping vegetation. Arrived at the bottom, they had a long, deep drink, and
then commenced the ascent, scaling the precipitous bank with all the courage
and sure-footedness of mountain goats. My own apprehensions of any casualty
occurring from a stumble during the journey were very materially diminished by
the time I had remounted.</p>
<p>Emerging into the open once more, we speedily found that our journey lay
across a succession of similar rugged gullies, each successive one being still
steeper and more dangerous-looking than the preceding. At noon we reached a
practicable water-course, having made, according to our reckoning, about
fifteen miles since starting. The spot was the site of a native hunting-camp,
and here we called a halt for luncheon. Packs were dropped, the horses were
haltered up in shady nooks, a dozen little fires were speedily burning, whereat
the yams and taros of the boys were roasting. A small provision of tobacco was
served out, and the bau-bau (bamboo pipe) was passed from mouth to mouth. The
method of smoking in New Guinea is peculiar. The pipe used consists of a couple
of joints of bamboo of moderate thickness and about thirty inches in length.
The tobacco is first wrapped in the green leaf of a particular tree (invariably
used for this purpose) and is then inserted in a small orifice bored near the
closed end of the pipe. When lighted, the smoke is inhaled from the open end
until it fills the tube; then the leaf containing the tobacco is withdrawn, a
whiff is inhaled from the orifice that held the weed, and the bau-bau handed to
the next smoker, who takes a whiff in turn and passes on the instrument. All
the stored fragrance being exhausted, the tobacco is reinserted and the same
process repeated until each one of the company has had his satisfying whiff.
The New Guinea smoker is not at all particular about the quality of his
tobacco; the real virtue of the narcotic indulgence lying rather in the leaf
wrappage than in the nicotian weed itself. Most of the bau-baus are embellished
with pretty designs resembling somewhat the native tattoo markings. These
decorations are burnt into the bamboo with a glowing slice of the sheating leaf
of the cocoanut kept at almost white heat by the native artist blowing upon it.
The end of the glowing ember forms a fine point which, on being slowly moved
along the desired lines, leaves indelible tracks.</p>

<b>08. Koiari Chiefs</b></p>
<p>A billy of tea and some tinned provisions, with an hour's rest, refreshed us
sufficiently, and we resumed our journey. The route for about five miles was
tolerably level, the country traversed being heavily grassed and admirably
adapted for horse breeding. Hearing the cries of some natives in the distance,
we learned from our boys that these denoted a body of Koiaris out on a
kangaroo-hunting expedition. Crossing a watercourse, the sides of which were
densely fringed with rabia (sago) palms, we came upon the hunting party,
numbering about a hundred. They were all armed with light hunting spears, and
their sole clothing was a bit of string girt round the waist. At several fires
the captured game was roasting, and heaps of sugar-canes of various kinds and
sizes&mdash;some of the canes being fifteen feet long&mdash;were lying about.
We were introduced to several chiefs, who gave us a hearty welcome and a
hospitable invitation to join their feast. Some sugar-cane&mdash;which was of
excellent quality, and much more refreshing than creek water, by the
way&mdash;sufficed for our own moderate needs; but the boys had no objections
to enjoying another spell and a feast of kangaroo roasted whole. After a
friendly smoke and chat with the hunters, who urged upon our leader that we
must not omit visiting their villages on our return journey, we and our dusky
entertainers parted company on the best of terms.</p>
<p>The Koiaris are, as a general rule, people of small stature, but well built
and muscular, and their condition indicates that they have an ample supply of
nourishing food.</p>
<p>Our route now lay along the tops of ridges, and still ascending, we soon
reached a razor-back range above 800 feet high. Although it was the season of
the south-east wind, when the atmosphere is always more or less hazy, we
enjoyed the wonderful panorama spread out at our feet. To the north-west we
could trace the course of the Laloki River for miles, descry the junction of
the Laloki and Goldie, about five miles distant, and a couple of miles beyond
that again the crossing place on the old diggers "track." On the northern
horizon loomed a high mountain, upon the summit of which (as our guide informed
us) stands the village of the tribe that speared and robbed Mr. Morrison, the
explorer. Its distance from where we stood was some seven or eight miles, and
this fact indicates the extent of Morrison's party's exploration of the
interior. Behind us, to the east and north-east, the serried ridges of the
Astrolobe Range stretched away for miles and miles, their wooded slopes and
rugged gullies being lost to view, at length, in clouds and mist. Southward in
the far distance we could discern the faint outline of the coast range that
hems in Port Moresby, whilst in the opposite quarter of the horizon, in the
direction of the Rano Falls, the rocky and precipitous face of Mount Vedura
towered full 2,000 feet above us. A magnificent scene, not to be forgotten by
the spectators. Mentally comparing it with similar scenery viewed in bygone
times in far-off lands, one might for an instant believe oneself transported
thither, but a glance at our dusky companions at once brought us back to
reality, and made us feel that we were actually in New Guinea.</p>
<p>The sun was sinking behind the mountains, and it was time to begin to think
of pitching camp for the night. A conference between our leader and the chief
of our carriers led to the selection of a spot on the banks of the Laloki,
distant about two miles in a northerly direction. The march, although but a
short one, was terribly trying, both to the horses and their riders. It was a
descent along the whole course; the tall grass hid numberless loose boulders,
making progress both difficult and dangerous, and compelling us to dismount and
walk. Besides this, there were many rugged gullies with steep precipitous sides
to cross, bearing testimony to the fury of the tropical rains from the
north-west quarter. The light-footed and accustomed carriers found no
difficulty in crossing these perilous mountain chasms, but it was needful for
the rest of the party to make frequent detours with the horses. These sagacious
animals plodded steadily on, although at times their only foothold was the
almost perpendicular bank of the river, densely covered with the thick foliage
of the wild vine and rattan, and amidst fallen trees and gnarled roots, forming
what might fairly be termed an impenetrable jungle.</p>

<br>
<b>09. The Haunt of the Alligator, Laloki Eiver</b></p>
<p>At length, about five o'clock, we reached a dry creek, some twenty yards
wide, with a smooth sandy bottom. The spot struck me as being just the place
for a snug encampment, and so I remarked to my guide. Hunter smiled drily, and
turning to the carriers, held a brief colloquy with them in their own language.
In an instant all faces were turned upon me, and I could see by their looks and
gestures that the party were pretty generally of opinion that I was, to put it
mildly, a harmless lunatic at large. Then our leader calmly explained to me
that the natives dreaded the spot, just on account of its inviting appearance
and its gentle slope towards the river. This latter advantage made it, in fact,
a favourite resort of alligators, which unpleasant reptiles would almost
certainly, if we were to camp there, pay us a visit of inspection during the
night, with an ultimate purpose of having an unusually fine feast. Accordingly,
a spot in the scrub about twenty feet above the smooth bed of the creek was
selected, which the natives at once set about clearing, prior to erecting a
calico fly tent, kindly lent us by the missionaries. Whilst some were driving
in stakes others lit fires, and others again went down to the river for water,
taking cautious care not to wade in farther than was just necessary to fill
their vessels. By this time the sun had sunk behind Mount Vedura, the short
twilight of the tropics had darkened to nightfall, and our evening
meal&mdash;tinned provisions and tea&mdash;was ready. Needless to say, we
enjoyed it heartily, for we were both tired and hungry, although our day's
journey had covered no greater distance than about twenty miles.</p>
<p>The impulse to "turn in" <i>instanter</i> was checked by the strange novelty
of the scene and circumstances. Accustomed as I was to wandering in the
unsettled regions of new colonies, I could almost fancy myself in another
planet. The hammocks of myself and my assistant were slung beneath the calico
roof. Hunter spread his blanket on the bare ground, the lamp was lit, and our
leader entertained us with many "yarns" of his previous expeditions. The
adventures of Captain Armit and his party were narrated in detail; the pathetic
circumstances attending poor Professor Denton's death were told with feeling;
how the whole party, with the exception of Hunter himself, were struck down by
sickness; how painfully difficult a task it was to get the sick men conveyed to
the coast; how fiercely insolent the natives became when the white men were
prostrate and helpless; all these and other incidents were vividly and
powerfully described. Hour after hour passed by, and still we sat listening,
held by the spell of the adventurous explorer, and losing all sense of
weariness in the interest of his story. A heavy fall of rain, which had been
threatening since sunset, at length broke up the party, and sent us to our
hammocks. But just before turning in, the natives (who had crowded round our
tent for shelter), through their leader made a request to Hunter. Laughingly
turning to me, he remarked, "Do you know what these fellows are asking?" I
pleaded ignorance. "They want me to fire off my gun to frighten the devil
away." The shot was fired, and this incident set us off talking again, this
time about the superstitions of the Papuan race, Hunter having no end of
anecdotes to narrate upon this very interesting topic.</p>
<p>Sleep at last claimed its empire, and the camp was silent. The rain fell
heavily all night, but I had taken the precaution to spread my waterproof over
the mosquito curtain of the hammock, so was tolerably snug and comfortable. No
night alarms disturbed our slumbers, and upon awaking in the morning, I found
that all my apprehensions of danger from the natives were completely dissipated
by twenty-four hours' residence in New Guinea. I smiled to myself at the solemn
precautions I had received about keeping continual watch, never allowing a
"nigger" to get behind me, and so forth. Confidence and kindness are effectual
preservatives, even when amongst the most savage population, as every good
missionary can testify.</p>

<br>
<b>10. Roasting Yams for Breakfast, Badeba Creek</b></p>
<p>At 6 A.M. the camp was astir. The rising sun had dispersed the rain clouds,
and although the mountain tops were folded in mist, the skies gave promise of a
fine day. Breakfast was dispatched at 7, and our leader went to gather in the
horses, which had been hobbled on a grassy flat on the other side of the creek.
This creek bears the name of Badeba, and is a common camping place for parties
visiting the Rano Falls. I took some lovely little views in the country
surrounding our camp, and also one of the camp itself, in commemoration of my
first night spent in a Papuan forest.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="image-11" id="id11"></a><img alt="" src=

<br>
<b>11. Near the Camp, Laloki River</b></p>
<p>A start being made at length, we rode on for several hours. But a little
before noon the rain-clouds began to gather once more, and I felt it would be
hopeless to get a good view of the Falls for my purpose that day. So I
bethought me of the invitation of our Koiari friends to visit them when passing
their village, and I asked Hunter to guide us thither. Retracing our route for
a few miles, the party struck off for the slopes of the Astrolabe Range. There
was no visible track, and the country traversed was extremely rough and
toilsome. Yet our carriers trotted merrily along under their loads, every now
and then dropping their packs to give chase to a kangaroo or wallaby, these
animals being very plentiful hereabouts. It was astonishing to note the ease
and celerity with which the youthful Papuans scampered up and down the steep
slopes. Ridge after ridge, each more rugged than the one preceding, was crossed
and left behind. Occasionally we caught a glimpse of a distant native village,
which was as speedily lost to sight. At length we reached a deserted village at
the foot of the range, on the summit of which, perched close to cloudland, we
could descry the village in which we were to pass the night. Terrible fellows
to feast are these New Guineamen! No sooner were the packs dropped than a fire
was lighted, at which a couple of kangaroo rats, caught during the afternoon,
were roasted, and a regular banquet was enjoyed. For vegetables there were
green Papaw&mdash;apples picked from the trees growing around the ruined and
deserted huts. A smoke and a "mild quencher" satisfied the civilized members of
the party.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="image-12" id="id12"></a><img alt="" src=

<br>
<b>12. Sad&atilde;ra Mak&atilde;ra, Koiari Village near Bootless Inlet</b></p>
<p>Mounting our steeds, we set their faces against the steep path ascending
towards the razor-backed hill right before us, leaving our carriers to finish
their feast. Our progress was slow, and finally we were compelled to dismount
and lead our horses. At length the level summit was reached, and from it we
surveyed another magnificent panorama of plain and sea and mountain. The whole
extent of Bootless Inlet lay spread out before us like a map. The setting sun
threw fantastic shadows across the hillsides, and long shafts of golden light
across the level plain stretching to the seashore. On the far horizon we could
dimly discern the breakers foaming on the sharper edges of the barrier reef. A
little nearer, some picturesque islets, each like a gem set in silver, lay
tranquilly on the calm waters; on the left hand lay Tupuselei, and on the right
Pyramid Head, the latter bearing almost due west. No fairer or more peaceful
scene at that hour could the pen of a poet describe, or the pencil of a painter
depict.</p>
<p>By this time the people in the village above us had discerned our approach,
and were waiting to welcome us. A crowd of friendly savages, all in <i>puris
naturalibus</i>, greeted us with shouts of gladness, and thronged around us
with infinite chattering, to lead us to our temporary domicile. The name of
this Koiari village is Sadara Makara. It looked as if newly built, and
contained about twenty huts of the usual description, four of these being
perched on the tree-tops, full forty feet above the ground. It chanced that the
great chief of the tribe was just then in the village, and being a particular
friend of Hunter, we were introduced to him, I myself being emphasized as an
artist who had come to take pictures of the village to be sent to far off lands
beyond the sea. This affable chief, who rejoices in the name of Lohio-bada,
shook hands with me cordially in the English fashion, and the same ceremony was
gone through by all the head men of the village. Lohio-bada even did me the
honour of requesting that I should exchange names with him. Hunter suggested
that my name (in Koiari) should be Misi Lolo, meaning "maker of pictures," and
I, consenting, was so denominated by these friendly savages during my stay
amongst them. One well-built and good-looking fellow, named Daiva, offered us
his hut to put up at, asking in return for this hospitable proposal the modest
honorarium of three or four sticks of tobacco. We agreed to this kindly offer,
and forthwith took possession of our hotel, the landlord with his wife and
little baby withdrawing to a lower storey of the dwelling. This consisted of a
sort of shelf, about 4 feet below the main floor of the hut, which stood on the
right side of the village street. The dimensions of the dwelling were about 20
feet by 16 feet on the main floor, and had a verandah of some 4 feet in width
and no higher where it joined the roof fronting the street.</p>
<p>Some rain had fallen just as we entered the village, and the whole of our
carriers, with about a dozen of their friends, who were curious to see the
visitors, crowded into the apartment for shelter. A perfect Babel of confusion
reigned, the whole crowd chattering, laughing, and exchanging news with one
another. A strong odour of cocoa-nut oil pervaded the place, that being the
unguent with which the Papuan savages anoint their person.</p>
<p>The news of the arrival of our ship with the Great White Chief had reached
the village, and, naturally enough, hundreds of questions were put to us,
whether this was really the biggest of the big chiefs they had been hearing
about since the proclamation of the British Protectorate. When Hunter assured
them that General Scratchley was the true White Chief, the native chiefs held
an earnest consultation amongst themselves, and Lohio-bada asked leave to call
on us again after we had taken our evening meal. The chiefs then retired. As
the atmosphere of the room had become by this time quite stifling, I called on
Hunter to disperse the crowd, so that we might eat our meal in peace. Slowly
and reluctantly the summons to "clear out" was obeyed; and whilst our landlord
and his wife gave the house a sweeping out and general tidying, we stepped out
to inspect the village.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="image-13" id="id13"></a><img alt="" src=
"1202541h-images/newguinea-13.jpg"><br>
<br>
<b>13. The Village Pet at Sad&atilde;ra Mak&atilde;ra</b></p>
<p>Whilst strolling round a native (through Hunter) proposed that I should buy
from him a pig at the price of a tomahawk, the porker to be slaughtered next
day, and made the <i>pi&egrave;ce de resistance</i> in a general feast. I
agreed to the terms, but, not having a tomahawk with me, I was obliged to
explain that the seller must give me credit, and must come himself to the Port
to obtain payment. The bargain was sealed at once, this simple child of nature
having no conception of anything like meditated deception in such a
transaction. The staple of the livestock of this village was, visibly, swine.
These animals swarmed everywhere, and followed us about like dogs of the
household. The particular pig which I now was able to claim as my private
property was pointed out to me; it seemed to be about half grown, and was in
very good condition.</p>
<p>On re-entering our lodgings we found tea awaiting us; and our hurricane
lamp, suspended from the rafter, threw a dim light upon a strangely
unaccustomed interior. Piles of yams, taro, and other edible roots occupied
three sides of the apartment; on the walls hung shields, clubs, and mouth
ornaments; sheafs of spears were stacked horizontally between the rafters and
the thatch. In the centre of the floor, which was made of battens of the sago
palm, stood the fireplace (about four feet by five), with an inch or two of
puddled clay for a foundation, on which lay a bed of ashes. Saplings of some
four inches thick, scarfed into one another and bound together with cane,
composed the fender, so that the precautions against a conflagration were fully
sufficient. Our biscuits being of rather inferior quality I tried the
experiment of substituting for these taro roots roasted in the ashes, which,
with some apple jelly, was a novel food I confess I greatly enjoyed. This root,
when carefully roasted, tastes somewhat like chestnuts, and is very palatable.
For second course we had a pot of rabia (sago) prepared in the primitive native
fashion, which is a little imperfect inasmuch as the washing given to the
farina is not sufficient to remove from it the colouring and fibrous matters,
so that it soon turns sour. Some of our own apple jelly added to the sago, with
the sharp sauce of hunger to give the combination an additional relish, we
managed to make a very hearty meal.</p>
<p>Tea over, I was about to take a quiet smoke when Hunter informed me that
Lohio-bada and some other chiefs were coming to give us a full account of the
onslaught made upon the tribe occupying this village by the neighbouring tribe,
the same troublesome people that had robbed and speared Morrison. To refuse to
hear their story would be counted a grave affront. Soon the dusky warriors made
their appearance, creeping in Indian file through the low doorway on hands and
knees. The dim light of the hurricane lamp played fantastically over their
savage features and imposing forms. They were arrayed in all their savage
panoply, evidently with the design of deeply impressing the white strangers.
Cassowary plumes and coronets of feathers adorned their heads; their white nose
ornaments contrasted grotesquely with their faces, painted in transverse
streaks of red and black in sign of mourning and woe. For a time not a word was
spoken. Presently there came in a steaming mess of rabia in a huge wooden bowl,
a present from the chief Lohio-bada's wife. This was first handed to Hunter,
who, as the representative man of our party, was obliged to go through the form
of eating a portion of the guest-meal. Then the bowl was passed from hand to
hand amongst the chiefs until it was entirely emptied. The empty bowl was again
handed to Hunter, who dropped into it a stick of tobacco as a token of thanks
for the hospitality shown us. The tobacco was for the use of the chief's
wife.&mdash;Note, to have refused to join in the meal, or to have failed to
drop a gift into the empty bowl, would have been deemed an unpardonable breach
of Papuan etiquette.</p>
<p>The bau-bau (the calumet of peace) was next passed round, and Hunter and
each of the chiefs took a whiff. Then the business of the session commenced.
Old Lohio-bada, in a very calm tone and collected manner, narrated the story of
the raid. He was listened to with deep attention, and, when he had finished,
the other chief corroborated his story, or supplemented it with fresh details.
Then Hunter addressed the chiefs, expressing the deep sympathy of the white
strangers with the losses and bereavements suffered by the Koiari tribe, and
pledged himself to lay the whole case before the Great White Chief, who,
doubtless, would deal out rigorous justice to their aggressive foes. Next
Hunter interpreted the substance of the conference to us, and we added our
condolence to his, with a promise to back up his representations to the
Commissioner. We noted that whilst we were speaking the chiefs intently scanned
our features, evidently to test the sincerity of our words. Their gestures to
one another showed they were thoroughly satisfied on that point. About nine
o'clock the chiefs bade us good night and withdrew.</p>
<p>When all fear of further interruption had passed away, I took down the lamp
from the rafter, and, swathing it in red cloth so as to exclude all actinic
light, I changed the plates I had taken in the morning for fresh ones, and
carefully stowed away the latent images in a light-tight box. I then settled
down for a last smoke before turning in. Meanwhile our carriers, who had been
paying visits to their friends in the village, returned to the hut in groups of
twos and threes. Finding that they were excluded from its shelter, they
cheerfully "camped out" underneath the hut, on the slope of the hill. The night
was not a comfortable one. First the rain fell in torrents, but, happily, the
roof was perfectly water-tight. I had spread my hammock and sleeping bag on the
batten floor, using the cases containing my instruments as a pillow. I was
roused from my first sweet sleep by Hunter's big kangaroo dog, which had crept
through the open door, purposely left so for ventilation, and had nestled close
to me. Awaking with a start, I gave the intruder a punch in the ribs which set
him howling, to the arousing of all hands. Quiet being restored, the native
baby below, which had reached the teething stage of its earthly career, set up
a yelling which was continued at intervals through the whole night. Worst of
all, the effluvium from the bodies of the sleeping carriers just beneath my
bunk was intolerable. I sat up and tried the effect of smoking strong tobacco,
but in vain. Luckily, in groping about the apartment for the large globular
vessel containing water (as I had become very thirsty), I upset it, and its
contents poured through the battens, soaking the unsavoury sleepers below,
thoroughly rousing them and sending them off to a drier spot. Towards morning
tired nature asserted its power, and in spite of rain, dogs, yelling infants,
and malodorous savages, I gained a few hours sleep.</p>
<p>The morning broke fair, but chilly, as the village stands at a high altitude
above the plain. Stepping forth into the fresh morning air, we stood gazing in
admiration at the surpassingly beautiful scene stretched out before us. In the
direction of the Astrolabe Range, in particular, the mountain scenery was
superb, rivalling in wild grandeur any I had ever seen before in my
travels.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="image-14" id="id14"></a><img alt="" src=

<br>
<b>14. Tree-house, Koiari Village</b></p>
<p>Breakfast over, I sallied forth into the village to take some pictures. The
native population, men, women, and children, gathered round Misi Lolo with a
childlike curiosity to watch my proceedings, and readily obeyed all
instructions. They stood in groups, took the proper attitudes, and even posed
picturesquely, as conscious that they were being immortalized in picture. When
Hunter, at my request, asked the men to mount to one of the tree houses, and to
group themselves in warlike array on the platform, as if defending their
garrison against the attack of a hostile tribe, they ran up the ladders with
the ease and agility of monkeys, donned their war coronets and masks, and in
full war-paint, armed with shields and spears, went through all the evolutions
of Papuan defensive fighting. They certainly looked anything but despicable
combatants. I succeeded in taking several fine photographs from savage real
life, all thoroughly characteristic of the manners and habits of these
mountaineers.</p>
<p>Not caring to wait for the feast of roast pig to be held later in the day,
and intimating to my creditor that I would pay for the pig all the same, I got
Hunter to collect our baggage and carriers, and made a start for Port Moresby.
The old chief, Lohio-bada, and several others, including my creditor,
accompanied us. On our route we came to a deserted village, whence this tribe
had been driven by a hostile tribe with a loss of sixteen lives.</p>
<p>We also noted a suspicious looking bundle hanging in the fork of a tree,
which we found upon inquiry contained the corpse of a woman. I was unable to
take a picture of this interesting object, of which, by the way, the natives
took not the least notice.</p>
<p>About ten miles from the coast we encountered Mr. H. O. Forbes and his
party, <i>en route</i> for Sogeri, where he intends to form his first depot. A
young German, Karl Kowald, in the employ of Mr. Romilly, attended the party as
interpreter, and the baggage carriers were of the Koiari tribe. Mr. Forbes
looked well and strong, and, like an ancient Roman emperor, marched afoot at
the head of his small army.</p>
<p>We reached the mission station tired and hungry, ready to do full justice to
the ample luncheon which Mrs. Lawes had provided for us. I paid and dismissed
my carriers, and had a long rest under the verandah. Towards nightfall I went
on board, and early next morning developed the plates exposed during the
journey. Most of the pictures turned out satisfactorily, so that I was well
pleased with the results of my first excursion in New Guinea. All the more so
upon finding that during my absence no misadventure had happened at
headquarters.</p>

<p>Amicable relations with the natives being thus established, Sir Peter
proceeded at once, with the assistance of Mr. Musgrave, to select a site for
Government House. They decided on a position originally chosen by the "Argus"
Expedition for the official buildings, and one on the adjoining rise for the
Governor's private residence, the great advantages of these sites being the
vicinity of a good spring of water, and a splendid view all over Port Moresby
and Fairfax Harbour. An expedition to Bootless Inlet occupied the day after my
return, the Governor and his party being accompanied by Captain Pullen of
H.M.S. "Lark," who made some observations. The report was not favourable to any
settlement being established on this inlet, as it possesses no river nor
agricultural land, and is a mere <i>cul de sac</i>. Before leaving Port Moresby
we were fortunate enough to witness a native regatta, in which the trading
vessels (Lakatois) already mentioned were competitors. The scene was animated
beyond description, the crowd on shore being as excited during the contest as
those on the banks of the Thames or the Isis.</p>
<p>On the 4th September the trial trip was made, the Lakatois from the village
at Fairfax, Planuabada, and Koetapu, at the foot of the mission station,
rendezvousing at the western extremity of the harbour. I landed with my
instruments, and succeeded in getting some excellent views of these picturesque
vessels, which, when in full sail, resemble a bird flying with its wings blown
over its head. The craft, with sails lowered, are poled against the wind to the
starting point, where they lie awaiting the fresher breeze of the afternoon.
About 3 p.m. we noticed sails being hoisted and a general bustle, upon which we
hastened from the mission house to the beach, and found collected there some
400 men, women, and children, whose interest in the sport was intensified by
most of them being part owners in one or other of the craft. On the signal
being given, moorings were slipped, and away went the boats, well together at
first, but eventually those furthest from shore getting the strongest wind, and
forging ahead amidst frantic shouts of delight from their owners. When some
distance out the boats luff, reverse sails, converting what was the bow into
the stern, and make for the point where the spectators are posted, greeted by
shouts of admiration and enthusiasm. This trial trip is regarded as a
semi-religious ceremony, charms and mystic rites being practised to ensure fine
weather and make the expedition a success. During the race a native ballet is
performed by the young girls on board the craft, who swing their bodies to a
chant composed of two notes only, and accompanied by the monotonous beat of
drums. Notwithstanding the high winds, I was able to get several most
successful unique instantaneous pictures of the scene, which convey a more
vivid impression of the Lakatois than any written description could afford.</p>

<b>15. Motu Girls, Port Moresby, also Paro Paro Apple Tree</b></p>
<p>On the 8th September the "Governor Blackall" got under weigh shortly after 7
a.m., and left Port Moresby to visit Red Scar Bay. Leaving Mourilyan to the
right, we took the inner passage, skirted Fisherman Island, steered for Lily
Island, and passed Boera about 10 a.m., the islets of Vari Varu now showing on
our port bow. From a distance they seem three disconnected rocks, the one
nearest the Australian coast being covered with timber, leafless at this
season, but which, as explained by the Rev. Mr. Chalmers, who had joined our
party, would burst into leaf in another month's time. The Torres Straits
pigeons, at certain seasons, settle here in thousands for rest, on their
passage to and from the northern parts of Australia. Opposite the Vari Varu
group, on the New Guinea coast, is Red Scar Head, easily discernible by three
trees growing on its otherwise bare brow, and a characteristic red patch,
visible a long way off, whence the locality takes its name. Galley Reach, the
mouth of the Manu Manu river, is passed at 11 a.m., and we could discern the
village and mission station at the entrance. Shortly afterwards we sighted
three rocks ahead, under the lee of which is our proposed anchorage for the
night. These huge boulders are named by the natives Ke Keni (the daughters),
from a legend that their parentage is derived from the mountains inland, but
Jack, less imaginative and geological, has christened them "Skittle Rocks." As
eight bells struck we anchored in five fathoms of water, about two miles from
shore, and nearly abreast the Aroa river, one of several streams taking their
source among the foot-hills of the Owen Stanley Ranges, and contributing
(especially during the N.W. Monsoon) a great volume of fresh water to Red Scar
Bay, materially checking the growth of coral. Hence the reef loses its
distinctive character hereabouts, and is merely indicated in the chart as the
probable trend of the sunken barrier, at a considerable distance from the
coast. The swell of the ocean, where not broken by the "Skittle Rocks," comes
in here with great force and causes a heavy surf on the bar of the Aroa,
especially at low tides. Two of our party, Mr. Romilly and Mr. Askwith,
afforded us considerable anxiety by starting out after luncheon with Charles
Kidd, a coast pilot, and one of the petty officers of the guard, in the ship's
dingy for the purpose of fishing. Hoisting the ill-fitting sail in the tiny
boat, away they scudded before the wind, towards the bar, anxiously watched by
the skipper, who last saw them right in the midst of the heavy breakers. As
night came on and they did not return much anxiety was felt about them, and,
notwithstanding the coast pilot's well-known skill, we were not reassured as to
their safety until the following day.</p>
<p>General Scratchley's principal object in visiting this locality was to open
communication with the native chiefs and sound them as to the acquisition of
land; more particularly with respect to certain real estate said to have been
recently acquired by a trader named Cameron. At 7 a.m. on the 9th September,
all preparations having been made the party started for shore, the steam launch
laden with provisions and camp equipage, towing the whale boat containing the
passengers in her wake. The little steamer was so overtaxed, that, on reaching
the surf, Mr. Chalmers, who directed the navigation, judged it best to cast off
the whale boat and pull ahead of the launch. The bar was crossed without
accident, and we found ourselves in the Aroa River proper, at its embouchure
some eighty yards across, but widening considerably higher up. Selecting a
landing place on the left bank, we discharged all our cargo, and pitched our
camp on a singularly picturesque little spot, trunks of driftwood in the
foreground forming a natural stockade, while to the rear lay a little estuary
with all its tropical surroundings. Leaving a few blue-jackets to pitch the
camp and keep guard, the whale boat, again towed by the launch, proceeded up
stream, which presented the usual characteristics of a tropical river, snags
and other obstacles impeding our progress by water, and dense scrub on the
banks rendering it impossible on shore. Mangrove and Nipa palms formed the
leading features for two miles, when a creek called "Akibaka" was reached. Here
the launch not finding sufficient depth of water, left us and returned to camp,
while we proceeded up the branch stream with the rising tide. This tributary
soon narrowed so considerably that at times the oars could hardly be used, and
great difficulty was experienced in clearing the boat from the snags and masses
of overhanging creepers. The Nipa trees in some places completely over-arched
the stream, giving it the appearance of a lofty avenue. Notwithstanding the
beauty of the scene at high water, considerations of alligators and miasma
would deter any judicious person from remaining in this locality longer than
absolutely necessary.</p>

<b>16. Sir Peter Scratchley's Camp, near Mouth of Aroa Eiver, Redscar
Bay</b></p>
<p>The temperature was moderate, probably not exceeding 80&deg;, and as we were
unmolested by mosquitoes the trip was not without enjoyment. The banks, for
some distance flush with the river, or nearly so, now became higher, and at
intervals native landing-places began to show. Then we noticed groves of Areca
nut palms, those bearing ripe fruit having one of their long fronds tied up in
a peculiar manner as a sign of ownership and taboo. Some four miles up Akibaka
Creek we came to the head of its navigation, where to our great satisfaction we
found our dingy minus its rudder, proving that our friends had been lucky
enough to cross the bar, and arrive thus far, at any rate, in safety. Near the
Mission boat-house we saw a few natives engaged in extracting the sago from the
trunk of the Rabia palm. The process, which is very primitive, consists in
cutting into shreds the fibrous pith of the palm, cut into lengths of about six
feet by means of a peculiar kind of adze, made of hard cane, attached to a
handle at an angle of 45&deg;, the light brown substance containing the farina
being carried away by women to the edge of the creek, and there deposited in a
primitive gutter made out of the butt end of an immense palm leaf. Water is
then poured upon it which dissolves and, in a rude manner, extracts the farina
from the pulp. News of our advent soon spread, and joined by a string of
natives we passed through a straggling village situated in a grove of tall
cocoa nut trees, till we came to a house of a better description, and were
introduced to Timoteo, the teacher located in this village, which is called
Vanuabada by the natives. Here we found Mr. Romilly and Mr. Askwith, who had
been made as comfortable as circumstances would permit.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="image-17" id="id17"></a><img alt="" src=
"1202541h-images/newguinea-17.jpg"><br>
<br>
<b>17. Native House at Vanuabada, Kabade District</b></p>
<p>After being refreshed with the delicious drink obtained from young
cocoa-nuts, I sallied into the village and succeeded in getting several very
successful views. The natives generally sleep in hammocks suspended underneath
their huts, which are built on piles about eight feet from the ground. We
counted as many as fifteen hammocks under one building, but the bulk of the
adult male population was absent in the plantations. Our stay at Vanuabada was
but short, as part of our programme was to cross overland and visit another
village on the main stream, and also inspect the intervening territory. Our
road lay through flats of blade-grass country, interspersed with groves of
cocoa-nut palms and thickets of tropical scrub. Although the soil appeared
friable and easy to cultivate, yet the shallow, dangerous navigation of the
river is a vital obstacle to its possessing any commercial value for years to
come, and the difficulty of shipping produce would involve great trouble and
expense. I fear, therefore, that Cameron's claim is of little value, especially
as his title is by no means clear. The natives have no notion of fee simple,
and are possessed with the idea that the original owners have the reversion of
real property on the death of the person to whom they sold it. Until the
question of land tenure is settled by Government, I would strongly advise no
one to contemplate the acquisition of real property in New Guinea, and indeed
not even then, for there are millions of acres in Australia, waiting for
purchase or selection, infinitely preferable in every respect to anything in
Papua. After an hour's walk along native paths, we reached another almost
deserted village, and penetrating the dense belt of scrub which borders the
Aroa, came in sight of the main branch of that river. On the way our party was
joined by Naiem&eacute; N&eacute;ru, the sub-chief of the Kabade district, and
after crossing the river, here a swift clear stream flowing between banks
twenty feet high, we came to the village named Ukaukana, of which Urevado is
the chief. Tired and hot, we were glad to take refuge in the house of Sameo, a
Samoan by birth, and mission teacher in this village. Bananas and cocoa-nuts
were served up on mats spread on the Rabia batten floor, and the General made a
few presents to Naiem&eacute; N&eacute;ru, which that sable warrior received in
true native style, <i>i.e.</i>, without evincing any visible gratitude or
emotion.</p>
<p>After resting an hour or so we sauntered through the village to trade for
native curiosities, but found little of interest or value, and the wind being
too high for photographing, returned the way we came to the teacher's house at
Vanuabada, where we enjoyed a set dinner, comprising boiled jungle fowl and
Goura pigeons with taro and yams, boiled plantains flavoured with grated
cocoa-nut forming a second course, the whole washed down with tea and the milk
of young cocoa-nuts. After dinner, Ur&egrave; Vadu, the head chief of Kabade
was introduced, attired European fashion, in an old Crimean shirt with a string
of beads round his neck. Naiem&eacute; N&eacute;ru sat beside him, and a
palaver then commenced; Mr. Chalmers translating for the High Commissioner's
benefit the chief's opinion of Cameron's land transaction. This was to the
effect that legal consent to the transfer had never been given, and that Mr.
Cameron had bartered his articles to people who had no right or title to the
land in question, and therefore no power to alienate it. Sir Peter took notes
of the proceedings, and from all I saw I came to the conclusion that Mr.
Cameron's time and money had been wasted. Presents were given to the chiefs,
who in their turn gave us feather coronets and native netted bags.</p>
<p>It being now time to think of returning, and the tide being yet too low to
float the boat, the General, Mr. Chalmers, and the rest of the party started
back on foot, I consenting to remain with my assistant and the three sailors,
and bring back the boat so soon as the water served. Little did I know what
that duty involved! had I foreseen all the labour those few six miles of inland
navigation occasioned I should have thought better of it. However, the foot
party started off at 4 p.m. pioneered by Mr. Chalmers, and half an hour later I
and my assistant went down to the creek intending to make a start, but found
our boat still docked in the mud, and our crew conversing with the natives like
Lord Byron at Venice, only without the aid even of a dictionary. There was
nothing for it but patience. The wind having lulled a bit, I utilized the
shining hour by getting a few views, including a native house with groups, and
the hammocks slung underneath as already described. My Winchester repeating
rifle also came into requisition, the accuracy of aim possible with this weapon
being much admired by our sable audience. At length I sat down on a log to make
notes, and began to smoke. My meerschaum pipe, which happened to have a pig
carved upon the bowl, attracted the attention of the natives, who at first
timidly, but afterwards more confidently, had gathered round me. Permission to
examine the pipe having been asked by signs and granted, it was returned to me
with many admiring looks. My boots, socks, and other garments were then
criticized and admired, and, in short, I became as great an object of interest
as Gulliver to the Lilliputians. At length we got the boat off, punting with
difficulty through the slimy mud, but the prospect of passing the night in the
creek with miasma and alligators for company made every one do his best to
reach camp before dark.</p>

<br>
<b>18. Native Teachers, Kabade District</b></p>
<p>The rising tide was against us, but served in floating our boat, and after
incredible struggling with snags and rank vegetation, to our great joy we
reached camp at half past seven, just in time for some fresh tea. After a merry
evening, to which the novelty of the scene lent charms, we turned in for the
night, Mr. Chalmers selecting the whale boat for his cubicle, the rest hitching
their hammocks as high above ground as possible. Hardly had we slept an hour
when a wild shriek roused the camp. All turned out, when the cause of the night
alarm was discovered to be a few stray wild hogs, who were on the prowl, and
doubtless attracted by the smell of our rations. On passing under the hammock
of one of the younger members of our party, the grunting awoke him, and his
terror took the above form, which probably alarmed the intruders as much as it
did us. He <i>said</i> he thought we were attacked by alligators, but we
insisted that his alarm proceeded from the fear of something supernatural and
of a still more malignant character. Yet one more night alarm. After two hours'
rest the steam whistle sounded from the launch; up jumped the engineer, made
for the shore and hailed, "Launch ahoy!" "Are you all right at the camp?" "All
right? Yes, what the deuce do you mean? what did you sound the whistle for?"
"We heard a boat come down the river, and thought the savages were attacking
the camp." "Savages be &mdash;&mdash;! Go to sleep!" growled the engineer.</p>
<p>It turned out that Timoteo the teacher, who had promised to visit us in the
morning, taking advantage of the high tide, had put in an appearance sooner
than was expected. The rest of the night passed quietly, and next morning,
before camp was struck, I took a few views, after which everything was packed.
We re-crossed the bar in safety about 9 o'clock, reached the ship an hour
later, weighed anchor and started for Port Moresby. Taking the Vari Varu
Islands, already mentioned, on our way, we anchored and spent the night under
their lee. I went ashore early with the General, and sought in vain for some
picturesque spot to photograph, although I traversed the greater part of the
islands, which are mainly formed of decomposed coral and coral limestone,
producing little or nothing but coarse grass and pigeons, of which the shooting
party got eighteen. We found the group of apparently three islands to be but
one at low water, being connected by reefs. At noon on the 12th September we
were lying at our old anchorage in Port Moresby.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th we were agreeably surprised by the arrival of
H.M.S. "Raven" which we had last seen at Cooktown, where she had been stationed
for six months. She brought us a mail, and remaining two days only, returned to
Cooktown. Before she left, and while we were still engaged devouring the
contents of the welcome budget of letters and newspapers, the "Herbert," for
which we were waiting, made her appearance after a somewhat long passage, which
was explained by the fact of her having bumped on a coral reef and narrowly
escaped wreckage at Hood Bay, nearly forty miles to the east, where she had no
business. Her getting off, after dragging her anchor cast in ninety fathoms,
was a piece of good fortune for which her captain has reason to be
thankful.</p>
<p>Attempting to profit by the detention of the "Blackall" at Port Moresby, I
constructed a temporary studio of framework covered with calico for the purpose
of making photographic studies of native heads, but I reckoned without my host,
or rather without the south-east trades, which blew very heavily nearly all the
time we lay in port. My studio was blown to pieces, and some conception of the
force of the wind may be formed from the fact of my being bodily carried away
some twelve feet with a screen which I had seized with the intention of saving
it. The floor of the verandah being six feet from the ground it was a marvel
that a fourteen stone Icarus like myself escaped without broken bones and
nothing worse than a few contusions, but as work was out of the question under
these conditions I was forced to put my mortification in my pipe and smoke it,
while Sir Peter and his secretary, having got through their despatches, confer
with Captain Musgrove, the Assistant Deputy Commissioner, as to the selection
of a site for a store-house to contain the articles now being landed with
infinite trouble from the "Herbert." As there is no jetty these have to be
lightered in more or less primitive fashion, or towed ashore. The construction
of a jetty must evidently be one of the first works undertaken, and as mangrove
piles can be procured close at hand, and the natives are accustomed to this
kind of work, the cost would not be very great. The superintendence of erection
of the store and dwelling-houses will occupy Captain Musgrave for weeks to
come. It is a matter of no small difficulty to acquire land, after making a
selection, for the native holdings are so sub-divided and cut up into sections
of so many shapes and sizes, with rights of way, water privileges, easements
and other obstacles attached to the transfer of real property which would do
credit to the ingenuity of a civilized conveyancer. On a comparatively barren
hill the Commissioner has had to pay at the rate of twenty shillings an acre,
and be glad to secure even at that price.</p>

<b>20. At Low Water, Native Houses at Koilapu</b></p>
<p>On Monday, the 21st, Mr. H. O. Forbes and party were ready to start on their
inland expedition, and I took a couple of photographs of them before they left.
Their first depot will be formed at Sogeri, a Koiari village, about forty miles
inland. There they will pass the rainy season, and start for their object
point, summit of Mount Owen Stanley, early next year. As the Koiaris are
friendly and intelligent, and the climate is comparatively salubrious, their
prospects of a successful expedition seem very promising. Soon after 9 a.m. on
the same morning we got up steam, and having bid farewell to our kind and
hospitable friends, Mr. and Mrs. Lawes, weighed anchor, Mr. Chalmers forming
one of the party.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="image-21" id="id21"></a><img alt="" src=

<br>
<b>21. H. O. Forbes and Party of Malays, also Captain Musgrave and Mr.
Lawes</b></p>
<p>In two hours we reached Tupuselei, a Papuan Venice, built in the sea, on
piles, and entirely isolated from the land, communication with which is carried
on by canoes. The inhabitants own productive plantations on the slopes of the
mainland, raising yams, bananas and other native food in abundance; they are
also expert fishermen, and being well to do, and on friendly terms with the
hill tribes, live happy lives after their fashion. On the 22nd, at 6 a.m., a
party started for shore in two boats; the General, Mr. Fort, Mr. Chalmers, and
the Doctor in the whaler belonging to the Mission, which Mr. Chalmers had sent
for the day before as being lighter and handier than the ship's long boat, and
the Captain, myself and assistant, and Charlie Kidd in the dingy. The pilot
(Charlie) speaks Motu, and was to act as our interpreter.</p>
<p>Leaving my instruments at the teacher's house, our party went roaming over
the hills, which are more picturesque than those at Port Moresby, shooting
birds and collecting seeds, while Sir Peter walked inland to see a village
which Mr. Chalmers was desirous to show him. Towards breakfast time the sun
dispersed the mist, which up to that time had shrouded the hills, and taking
advantage of the opportunity I got a series of nice pictures, including groups,
as Charlie made my wishes known, and the natives for a few sticks of tobacco
were pleased to pose. Some curiously carved temples, or rather feasting stages,
attracted our notice, while hard by was a Christian church in course of
erection, a proof of missionary labour. We then called again at the Mission
House, and Tua, the teacher's wife, did the honours, offering us bananas and
plenty of fresh young cocoa-nuts. These teachers here come from the Hervey
Group, and appear to get on remarkably well with the Motu people. A few
presents were made to Tua in the shape of several yards of mosquito netting,
which I supplemented with a few handkerchiefs and a bit of looking-glass, a
toilet requisite agreeable to the feminine mind all over the world. We rested
awhile in the house, which is built on the usual native lines, but remarkable
for its cleanness and neatness. The calico counterpanes of the beds, spread on
the floor, showed a rude aptitude for design in their ornamentation with a
patchwork pattern formed by folding squares of Turkey red twill, and slashing
out pieces with the scissors, just as designs are often made in Europe out of
tissue paper. In a barbaric country such as this, even a slight approach to
civilized taste attracts as much attention as does a collection of savage arms
or designs in London or Paris.</p>

<br>
<b>22. Tupuselei (Marine Village) from the Shore</b></p>
<p>Our visit to the Mission House terminated, we started in the dingy, Tua the
teacher's wife accompanying us, to visit the marine village, whose
picturesqueness may be better understood by the views which it was my good
fortune to get, than by any detailed description. To behold a community like
this living in a village consisting of rickety huts six feet above the water,
and half a mile from shore, excites wonder and astonishment, not the least
difficult problem to solve being how the builders managed with the slender
means at their disposal to drive the piles supporting the houses into the sea.
Many of the huts had a list to leeward, and Mr. Chalmers informed us that
unless they are particularly well-built, or supported by their neighbours, the
prevailing wind can always be determined in this way. Poultry, pigs, and dogs
are plentiful in the village, and to see one of these latter paying a visit to
a canine friend over the way is a sight never to be forgotten.</p>

<br>
<b>23. The Chief's House, Marino Village of Tupuselei</b></p>
<p>None but a Tupuselei dog bred and born could ever hope to ascend the
slippery ladders, with rungs two or three feet apart, leading to the platforms
of the huts from the level of the waterway. At first when we noticed one of
these animals swimming across we thought he would be assisted on landing; but
no, he was left to his own devices, and after several futile attempts, most
ludicrous to behold, he succeeded in accomplishing his object, and obtained a
footing. The interiors of the dwellings were certainly not inviting, appearing
dark and dirty; still there are said to be authenticated cases of white men of
respectable families choosing native wives and settling down happily. Well, "de
gustibus non est disputandum," or, as the French put it, "Les extr&egrave;mes
se touchent."</p>
<p>We were now joined by the General, Mr. Chalmers and party, much pleased with
their visit to Padiri. They reported the country between that village and the
coast to be fertile. Some of the Koiari chiefs accompanied them to Tupuselei
and received the usual presents.</p>
<p>The Doctor, who previously to leaving Port Moresby had been down with fever,
was much better, and invigorated by his walk. Several of the men, however,
showed indications of sickness, one of the petty officers in particular, having
a bad attack, the symptoms being feverishness and a foul tongue. For my own
part I never felt better in my life, and certainly shall not worry myself with
apprehensions, but meet the evil when it comes.</p>

<br>
<b>24. Women of Tupuselei going for Water</b></p>
<p>Remaining at our anchorage all night, on the morning of the 23rd we steamed
down the coast to visit Kaele, a village some ten miles beyond Tupuselei, and,
like it, a marine settlement. Our diplomacy will here be called into
requisition to settle a feud existing for some time between the people of this
village and the Garians, a numerous inland tribe. The merits of the case, so
far as we can ascertain them, are that the Garians were the aggressors, killing
three of the Kaele people, who retaliated in kind, and so the vendetta went on,
amongst other victims being a Kaele woman. Matters, it is stated, have come to
such a pass that the Garians have formed alliances with their neighbours, and
threaten to come down and exterminate the unfortunate Kaeleans. At the
intercession of Mr. Hunter the General gladly consented to come down and use
his influence in the cause of peace, and messages were despatched to all the
principal chiefs to meet him at Kapa Kapa, the village next in importance to
Kaele, and situated about ten miles to the eastward, the "Blackall" calling at
Kaele on her way to investigate matters. We reached the village about noon, and
found both teachers and the people generally in a great state of agitation,
being cut off from their supplies on the mainland, and reduced to cook their
food in sea water. Some women who had ventured to the creek for water that
morning reported that the Garian warriors had been seen on the slopes, and that
an attack was imminent. The General, without attaching too much importance to
this scare, ordered the whale boat to be manned, and an armed party, with whom
were Mr. Chalmers and Mr. Fort, landed about 5 p.m., and proceeded to search
the mangrove scrub of the salt-flats for the supposed enemy. We watched them
with glasses from the ship, displaying much more interest in their proceedings
than did the villagers, who were singularly apathetic in the matter. About
sundown the party returned without having seen any traces of a foe.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="image-25" id="id25"></a><img alt="" src=
"1202541h-images/newguinea-25.jpg"><br>
<br>
<b>25. Mangrove Scrub, near Kaele</b></p>
<p>Kaele is a miserable place, and its church, situated about 200 yards from
the shore, and adjoining the house of Mr. Hunter, whose knowledge of the Motu
language was of great service, had a strong list to the north-west. Early next
morning, the 24th, the Captain, myself, and assistant, accompanied by Charley
Kidd, went ashore to take a stroll round. The place looked even more desolate
by daylight than in the shades of evening, and finding nothing picturesque near
the beach but ruins of a tree house, which had a look of having been built to
the order of the artist who sketched it to illustrate the proceedings of the
Geographical Society of Australia, we penetrated the fringe of mangrove, and
crossed a belt of low country covered with salt water grass till we arrived at
another strip of mangrove, interspersed with tall forest trees. There were as
usual a quantity of birds, and a few wallaby crossed our path, but not within
shot. After taking a couple of pictures illustrative of mangrove country, we
returned to the ship quite ready for breakfast, but not at all impressed with
the quality of the land. At noon we got under weigh again, and at two dropped
anchor at Kapa Kapa, about two miles off the beach. The charred ruins of old
Kapa Kapa were still discernible away to the east of the ship. This village had
been destroyed about two years ago by the Hula natives, who, sparing women and
children, massacred three of the men. The others taking flight, sought shelter
within the houses of their next neighbours, with the inevitable effect of
overcrowding to such an extent as to cause the outbreak of an epidemic which
led to the evacuation of the village altogether. The present village is built
half over the water, and the other half over dry land, and the number of
inhabitants is estimated at about 500.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 25th I sallied out to pick up character sketches, and
was so fortunate as to get a splendid group of natives, with a man and woman in
deep mourning forming the central objects. This couple, we were told, had lost
three of their children within a recent period, and their grief was deeply
pronounced. They wore the usual native mourning of suits of charcoal, with
which their bodies were blackened entirely. Strings of grey or lavender
coloured beads were carried across their foreheads, and hung pendulous from
their ears. The man wore an immense Cassowary plume, also blackened, and the
woman had her breast covered with netting. Their appearance was so picturesque,
that I was most anxious to include them in the group, but it required a good
deal of persuasion from our interpreter to induce them to sit, and they
accepted the tobacco presented them with apparent indifference. We then took a
stroll of a few miles inland, and found it to be one of the most fertile tracts
of country yet visited, containing miles of flat grassy plains interspersed
with belts of tropical scrub, which would delight the botanist, stretching away
to the rises inland, whose rich vegetation indicated soil of good quality.</p>

<b>26. Group of Natives at Kapa Kapa, central figures in mourning</b></p>
<p>The country is admirably adapted for sugar, and the clearing of the scrub
would cost comparatively little. I secured a couple of good views near a
crossing, and in the bed of a creek called by the natives Ka Kalo. Walking
across the bed of this creek, almost dry at the present season, and covered
with sand and shingle, we were struck by the great depth of black fertile soil
on the almost perpendicular banks. The vegetation was not unlike that to be
seen in scrubs of the Clarence or Richmond rivers in New South Wales, but of a
richer and more tropical type.</p>

<br>
<b>27. The Kalo Creek, Kapa Kapa District</b></p>
<p>Lovely parrots, parroquets, scrub pheasants, and white cockatoos, filled the
air with their harsh cries, and a great variety of pigeons from the large Goura
to the tiny bronze wing dove appeared in numbers. We saw a great variety of
indigenous fruit trees, and heartily enjoyed a feed of mangoes which one or our
black companions good-naturedly procured for us by climbing a large tree of
that species, and shaking the ripe fruit in a perfect shower to the ground.
Although the fruit, which is about the size of a goose-egg, is rather stringy
in the flesh, its flavour is very delicate.</p>
<p>On our way back to the ship we passed again through the village, and bought
some spears and other weapons. They value their stone adzes and clubs very
highly, and will rarely part with them except in exchange for a good tomahawk.
The fishing spears are made of about a dozen prongs of hard wood, lashed to a
handle six feet long, the prongs being kept apart by interlacing with string
eight inches from point.</p>
<p>A few seed pods are sometimes suspended from the shaft by way of ornament.
The plumes of the red birds of Paradise commanded ridiculous prices all along
the coast. At Goldie's Store in Port Moresby fifteen shillings is asked for a
plume, and twenty-five shillings for an entire bird. We obtained a few birds
from the native teachers at lower prices, but still above what they could be
bought for in London. The same remark applies to nearly all the curios we saw,
their enhanced value being attributable to the demand created by the number of
men-of-war which have visited the coast during the last twelve months.</p>
<p>The afternoon of this day was memorable for the visit of the Garia and Saroa
chiefs, who, seventeen in number, came off in the teacher's whaleboat, which
they filled from stem to stern. They looked fierce savages indeed. One warrior
sported an old suit of pyjamas, the others being naked with the exception of
their waist-strings. One was in deep mourning, got up in the manner stated. His
Cassowary head-dress covered his face down to his neck, and altogether he
looked the wildest specimen of the human race I ever saw. Another had short
curly hair all over his body, and a frightfully ugly mouth, the expression of
which was not improved by the betel nut he was constantly chewing. They were
ushered to the poop, asked to sit near the wheel, while Mr. Fort and Mr.
Chalmers arranged the presents which they were to receive in case they
faithfully promised to leave off molesting Kaele, and keep the peace. I took a
picture of this assemblage, perhaps the most curious human group ever assembled
on the deck of a steamer, the chiefs making no objection, although none of them
had ever seen a camera before, and they probably supposed the proceeding to be
some mystical rite preliminary to the negotiations. The General then took his
seat, and, through Mr. Chalmers, inquired into the cause of the war. They
pleaded annoyance and aggression on the part of the Kaele people, and were told
that Sir Peter had come to establish "maino" (peace) all over the island. They
were asked to desist from hostilities, and promised in case of compliance that
presents were to be distributed to show that sympathy was felt with their
grievances.</p>
<p>During the harangue I noticed their faces lighten up at the prospect of
peace and tomahawks, and when the speech was over, all but the chief in
mourning declared willingness to terminate the war. At last even he, seeing
that he stood alone, gave in his adhesion, and each accepted a tomahawk, six
sticks of tobacco, a handkerchief, and a gorgeous Brummagem ring. These latter
were given to each chief separately, as a special token of faithful adherence
to his promise. Sir Peter then dismissed them, saying that he would return in
two months to see if their promises were kept. The whole affair gave little
trouble, for these warriors, although ferocious in aspect, are easily led by a
strong consistent man who treats them fairly. Before leaving the vessel they
were shown over her. Many of them had never been on a European ship before, and
the large mirror in the cabin, which was in a state of semi-darkness,
astonished them greatly. The evening terminated with a lunar eclipse, almost
total at the rising of the moon, and continuing till 9 o'clock.</p>

<b>28. New Guinea Trophy, Weapons and Implements</b></p>
<p>Next morning at daybreak Sir Peter and some of his staff, under the guidance
of Mr. Chalmers, visited some of the inland villages and were very well
received everywhere, being presented with bird of Paradise plumes and stone
clubs. In one village a fair exchange of produce was in progress, and all the
people seemed greatly pleased at the re-establishment of peace. This (Friday)
was a quiet day, all being tired with their tramp the day previous. Captain
Lake and I had a few hours shooting with good success, but I find taxidermy
added to photography too great a demand upon my time and patience. The same
remark applies to the formation of a botanical collection, which to approach
completeness requires a man's whole time to form, collate, and catalogue.</p>
<p>On Saturday the 26th we weighed anchor, and after a couple of hours steaming
through coral reefs, let go the anchor opposite Hula, to rest and prepare for
an inland expedition on the Monday following.</p>

<p>At daybreak on Monday, September 28th, all was astir on the "Governor
Blackall." Sir Peter Scratchley, Mr. Fort, Mr. Chalmers, myself, the Doctor,
and one or two others started in the dingy, towed by the launch, for shore,
which, owing to the low tide, we reached by a circuitous route, and had to be
carried through the shallows pick-a-back. Once landed, we commenced our work,
which was nothing more or less than a pedestrian excursion under the guidance
of Mr. Chalmers, to the village of Kalo, some miles inland, making Hula, where
we landed, our base. A crowd of natives surrounded us on landing, anxious to
earn a little tobacco by assisting to transport our baggage. A dozen were told
off to carry the Governor's effects, and four more took my apparatus and
wardrobe on their brawny shoulders. After getting clear of the village I
counted over fifty brothers, sisters, cousins, and aunts of the bearers
following our party on the chance of a stray bit of tobacco. The country
through which we passed was richly cultivated, containing miles of native
plantations devoted to bananas, sweet potatoes and yams. Some of the gardens
were in splendid order, and cultivated with Chinese minuteness, the young
shoots of the yams being sheltered from the sun by husks and leaves.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="image-29" id="id29"></a><img alt="" src=
"1202541h-images/newguinea-29.jpg"><br>
<br>
<b>29. Native House at the Village of Kamali</b></p>
<p>We found numbers of women at work, and at every cocoa-nut grove we passed we
were offered a refreshing drink. The cocoa-nut is very abundant here, and
consequently very cheap. Forty young nuts or twenty full grown ones can be
purchased for a fig of trade tobacco, a price at which the "three sticks a
penny" fraternity might invest to a fabulous profit, could they but get their
goods delivered at Epsom. After traversing three or four miles of fertile
country, we arrived at the inland villages of Babaga and Kamali. The buildings
here differ from the marine dwellings considerably. The piles on which they are
built are mostly strong timber up to eighteen inches in diameter, and how with
their primitive appliances they manage to move these huge logs is a mystery. I
took views of some of these houses, which have two platforms, or rather a large
platform and verandah in front, the latter corresponding to the upper story of
the structure. The chiefs' houses are further decorated with a fanciful spire
at the apex of the gable, sometimes with poles projecting from their sides
ornamented with streamers or pennants of bark. The inland people suffer
terribly from skin diseases, far more so than the coast tribes, who are by no
means exempt, but here, where water is not abundant, two persons out of three
are more or less affected. A great mortality must have prevailed lately, as we
saw numbers of people in mourning and observed charnel houses and graves in the
streets, under the dwellings, and in fact anywhere and everywhere, while the
odour of decomposing heaps of vegetable matter rendered the atmosphere anything
but savoury, and quickly drove us away. On the outskirts of Kamali we came upon
a picturesque dwelling which I photographed, while Dr. Doyle Glanville employed
his pencil in sketching a woman in mourning. Kamali being more attractive than
the village we had just quitted I remained to get a few studies, while the rest
of the party went on ahead. The arrangement was that Sir Peter was to meet a
boat at the crossing of the Kemp Welch river and be ferried to the launch which
would rejoin the "Governor Blackall" at her fresh anchorage at Kerepunu. I felt
some misgivings as to getting sitters, being as I was unable to communicate
with the people except by signs, but to my astonishment all the inhabitants
turned out, evidently with the object of being photographed, and Mr. Chalmers
subsequently informed me that such is their vanity that had they but money, a
photographic artist in New Guinea would rapidly accumulate a fortune.</p>
<p>After an hour's rest I started with my four bearers in pursuit of the rest
of the party who had preceded me to Kalo. The road lay through yam plantations
and luxuriant groves of cocoa-nut palms, left to grow as they pleased, the
native merely collecting the crops. The rapidity with which a Papuan can ascend
a palm tree is marvellous. On an indication that a drink would be appreciated,
up he goes, and in an incredible short space of time throws down half-a-dozen
young nuts just fit for tapping. His method of ascending is to take anything
that will spin into a lanyard, such as a bit of rattan, the rib of a cocoa-nut
leaf, or even a handful of long grass. This he ties over his feet near the
instep, connecting the feet by a pliable link, then by alternate movements of
hands and feet he ascends the straight stem of the palm. Arrived underneath the
fronds he holds on with one hand, and with the other twists the nut round the
stem till it drops. Boys eight or ten years old can do this as well as the men,
and I have no doubt the girls are equally agile, though as yet I have not seen
them mount a tree.</p>
<p>I arrived at Kalo just in time for lunch in the house of Tau the Rarotongan
teacher, changing my clothes immediately, a precaution against fever which
should always be taken after a fatiguing journey. After a rest and a smoke the
General and his party walked to the river bank, where the boat was in waiting
to proceed to Kerepunu, while I and my assistant made ourselves comfortable at
Tau's house, where we were to spend the night. The Kalo people were in a state
of great delight at the presents their chiefs had received from the General,
whose visit tended to efface the sanguinary reprisals made by the blue-jackets
of H.M.S. "Wolverine" after the murder of ten teachers in the place. We were
shown the marks of the bullets in the cocoa-nut trees, and altogether the
people seemed to cherish a healthy recollection of the chastisement inflicted
upon them, which was severe, the village being surrounded and several men shot
before the rest were allowed to escape into the bush. The chief's house was
razed to the ground.</p>
<p>The teacher, Tau, informed us that the people are still somewhat predatory
in their habits, his chest having on one occasion been broken open and eight
pounds of tobacco stolen. On complaint being made to the chief, he compelled
restitution of all the unconsumed tobacco and gave Tau a large pig to make up
the difference. A large portion of the village was recently destroyed by fire,
and is now in course of re-building. Among other curious sights we were shown
the price or dowry of a wife heaped up on the platform of one of the houses. It
consisted of a quantity of all kinds of New Guinea goods and chattels, pots,
earthenware, and wooden weapons, bird of paradise plumes, baskets of yams,
bunches of bananas and other produce. Among the articles were two pigs tied up
underneath the house. The bride herself sat all smiles on the verandah above,
over her earthly treasures, with as much pride as any white sister might feel
on exhibiting her trousseau. I regretted that owing to the lateness of the
evening I could not secure a picture of this curious scene, but managed to give
the lady a prominent place in a group next morning.</p>
<p>Skin disease is also rife here. We saw a young man walking about the village
with his arm round his sweetheart's neck, both of them frightfully afflicted.
He had a sore on his leg above the ankle, laying bare the bone, while she, not
naturally ill-favoured, was covered with large patches which made her look
positively mangy. Still, neither of them seemed to mind it in the least, and
looked supremely happy. The head-dresses of marriageable girls are picturesque,
their hair being frizzed and decorated with pink shells from Port Moresby,
highly valued by them, strings of Venetian glass beads procured from the
traders being woven in. All the women are tattooed from head to foot, and a
peculiar necklace-like V-shaped mark, ending in a peak between the breasts,
indicated those engaged or married. These cuticular devices, although obvious
enough to the eye, do not show in a photograph unless picked out with black or
some colour, a proceeding too tedious to perform even if they should be willing
to submit to it.</p>

<br>
<b>30. The Chief's Spire House at Kalo (in course of re-construction)</b></p>
<p>During our stay with Tau the house, doorways, and ladders on both sides were
constantly crowded with natives attracted by motives of curiosity, and anxious
to get a bit of tobacco or even the stump of a cigar. I commissioned Tau to buy
me some bird of paradise plumes, leaving him a quantity of tobacco for the
purpose, and making him a present of print and other articles for himself and
wife. He told me that so long as the ship was in sight, the price of all curios
was forced up to a fancy value, but that after her departure the beloved "Kuku"
would purchase anything at reasonable rates. The commercial ways of savages are
very like those of civilized beings to be sure! the tobacco I brought&mdash;the
best American Raven twist&mdash;was too good for the market; anything will do,
if black and strong.</p>

<b>31. Mourners and Dead-house at Kalo</b></p>
<p>On the 29th, although it was still blowing hard, I managed to get some nice
groups, and especially one of two women in mourning, keeping watch at a hut
erected over the remains of some departed relative; I was obliged to go to
leeward for the view, and as photography appeals to the eye and not the nose, I
deemed the public had the best of it. Numbers of women sat outside the houses
busy making ramis (petticoats) out of strips of fibrous leaves spread out in
the sun to dry, and performing certain duties for each other often mentioned by
previous travellers. After breakfast we started for Kerepunu, crossing the Kemp
Welch river in a native canoe close to where the massacre of the teachers took
place. The river is about a hundred yards wide and being shallow at its mouth
can only be entered by boats of light draught.</p>

<br>
<b>33. Kerepunu Women at the Market Place of Kalo</b></p>
<p>Once across the bar there is water enough to float a big ship. About a mile
from its mouth the stream bifurcates, the smaller affluent being nearly dry at
low water, while the larger is navigable for about fifteen miles, and is
supposed to take its rise in the neighbourhood of the Laloki, but on the
eastern side of the water shed, running along the back of the Astrolabe range,
until it reaches the level land at the back of Hula. The vegetation here is
extremely rich, and the luxuriant condition of the native gardens indicates the
great fertility of the soil. Dismissing our ferry men with a small present of
tobacco, we proceeded with our bearers along the sandy beach. The glare of the
sun on the shore and water was oppressive and I was thankful that I had
provided myself with a pair of Mr. Gaunt's smoked goggles before leaving
Melbourne, as they saved my eyes, not only from the sun's rays but from the
sand and grit blown up by the strong wind, to say nothing of the protection
they afford against flies in the scrub. The teacher was rather uneasy about a
little river named "Alerai" which had to be crossed before reaching Kerepunu.
At dead low water it is only about knee deep, but on reaching it we found that
the rising tide had extended its width about sixty yards. We shot a couple of
brace out of a flock of curlews we found at its mouth.</p>
<p>Having no mind to follow the example of Horace's peasant and sit down
half-a-dozen hours in the broiling sun, "Expectantes dum defluit amnis," we
stripped and prepared to wade across, braving the alligators, which the teacher
informed us were plentiful and possessed good appetites. First went the boys
carrying their burdens over their heads and fortunately keeping them dry,
though the water reached up to their shoulders. The teacher and myself
followed, and last of all came Mr. Bubb, my assistant. With my broad-brimmed
straw hat, and goggles, and singlet, rolled up under my armpits, but otherwise
in a state of nature, I must have presented a picturesque appearance, at any
rate, I caused some amusement to our bearers, who sat waiting for us on the
opposite side. The bottom was soft sand, sinking a foot with every step, but we
got across without mishap and felt refreshed with our bath. Along the remaining
two miles of hard beach I walked barefooted, but was compelled to resume my
boots on crossing a neck of land covered with cocoa-nut trees and
brushwood.</p>
<p>Emerging from the thicket we found our ship snug at anchor in Hood Lagoon,
with the village of Kerepunu as a background. The mouth of Hood Lagoon is about
a mile wide and at high water sufficiently deep to allow vessels of fifteen
feet draught to enter. Further inland it widens considerably and appears about
eight miles long by six in diameter. The depth in some places is considerable,
but the best anchorage is just within the narrow neck at the entrance. We got
on board without loss of time and were glad of a bath and change of clothes.
Tau, our guide, crossed over to Kerepunu to visit Manu, the teacher there, at
whose house the teacher of Hula was also staying. Their wives had come with the
ship to Kerepunu to assist in the ship's washing, fresh water being more
abundant here than at Kalo or Hula.</p>

Described</blockquote>
<p>Kerepunu lies on the eastern headland of Hood Lagoon, and contains about
1,500 inhabitants, rising to the importance of a town rather than a village or
hamlet. The Mission House is built of lath and plaster, its foundations being
blocks of coral. The glebe, about an acre in extent, attached to the Mission
is, from its exposed position, unsuited for culture, and only useful for
purposes of recreation. A few hundred yards to the east lies the fishing
village of old Hula, tenanted by the remnants of a tribe which was numerous and
flourishing only a few years back, but the bulk of them abandoned their village
owing to tribal wars, and settled about twelve miles further west, the new
settlement receiving the same name already mentioned in the previous
chapter.</p>
<p>The present inhabitants remain on sufferance, being allowed by the Kerepunu
men to stay only so long as they supply the large village with fish. Old Hula
is built partly on the sea, and partly in a ravine close to the shore. Facing
the village are extensive coral reefs, and <i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i> is
collected in considerable quantities, and bought up by a trader named Dan
Rowan, who ekes out a precarious subsistence by drying, smoking, and selling
it. During our stay there occurred a collision with the natives, which might
have entailed serious consequences, but which, as things turned out, ended
happily. That the imprudence of some members of the ship's company did not
involve us in a serious embroglio was a most fortunate circumstance. After tea
one evening one of the bodyguard and two stewards went on shore, the latter
without leave. They stayed rather late, and while walking round the village and
romping with the natives, had a few sticks of tobacco stolen from them. This
they somewhat noisily demanded back, using intimidating gestures, and the
result was a panic, the natives assuming that their village would be burnt if
the missing tobacco were not restored. Howling and shrieking, the women
snatched up their children and fled into the bush, making so great a hubbub,
that those on board the "Blackall" became seriously alarmed on the circumstance
of three members of the company being on shore becoming known. Captain Lake and
Mr. Chalmers at once went on shore in the dingy to ascertain the cause of the
disturbance, and rescue the men if possible. By the time they reached the shore
the commotion had greatly abated, and they discerned some white men putting off
in a native canoe, which they pursued, and identified the occupants.</p>
<p>The General was naturally much annoyed at the circumstance, and the matter
was thoroughly investigated next day, a High Commissioner's Court being
convened, which the culprits were summoned to attend. The Court was held at the
teacher's house, the evidence of the native witnesses being translated by Mr.
Chalmers and the teacher, and taken down by me. The decision was reserved, but
the proceedings were conducted with dignity and decorum, and evidently made a
strong impression on the native mind. The congregation assembled afforded an
excellent opportunity for an ethnologist. The admixture of races here becomes
very noticeable, and further eastward the lighter coloured Polynesian type
becomes more and more pronounced.</p>
<p>The next district to be visited is Aroma. Koapena, the great chief of that
part of the country, hearing of the General's intention of going there, came
down to Kerepunu, and was His Excellency's guest on the trip to Aroma. We left
Kerepunu on the morning of the 2nd October, but got stuck on a sand-bank
shortly after starting, and had to wait four hours till the rising tide floated
us off. This delay necessitated the postponement of our journey for a day, as
the captain was unwilling to navigate those dangerous waters in the dusk. We
dropped anchor opposite a village called Parimata, distant as the crow flies
only twelve miles from Kerepunu, but on account of the coral reef involving a
d&eacute;tour of some twenty-seven. This village presented a peculiar
appearance from long lines of high fences, looking in the distance like
stockades. We found these to be designed to break the force of the wind, which
beats on the low sandy shore to the detriment of both houses and plantations.
They are made of a framework of tough sticks and saplings fastened together
with rattan, and interlaced with cocoa-nut leaves, butt end upwards. They are
fully twelve feet high, and seem to answer the purpose for which they were
designed perfectly.</p>
<p>The Mission House is close to the beach, and the premises are larger than
those at Kerepunu. The teacher Tenaori is a determined looking man of powerful
physique, and seems well fitted for his post. Not long ago he was the means of
saving the lives of over fifty Motu people, for which service he was presented
by the General with a nice silver watch, bearing a suitable inscription. The
history of the exploit is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Some little time ago a trading canoe belonging to Port Moresby got caught in
a gale of wind on its return from Motu Motu, and driven past its own port, was
wrecked on the reef of Keppel Point, not a great distance from Parimata. There
were in all fifty-six persons on board; a traditional feud existing between the
Aroma people and the Motu's, the young Aroma warriors, anxious to take
advantage of so large a number of their foes being placed in their power,
launched their canoes with the intention of massacring them all. Tenaori,
seeing their preparations, and learning their object, at once put off in the
Mission Boat to interpose and save life. He was after some parley allowed to
land unaccompanied, the Motu people knowing their danger, and being greatly
apprehensive of a hostile visit. Their anticipations were indeed realized, for
soon the Aroma war canoes came in sight. On their approaching within hailing
distance, Tenaori harangued the warriors in true native style, and by alternate
coaxing, bullying, cajoling, and threatening, induced them to forego their
project. He then took the Motus off the reef to the Mission House, a boatload
at a time, fed them, and finally crowned his diplomatic work by sending them to
Kerepunu in the canoes of the very persons who had meditated their
destruction.</p>
<p>Thence they were shipped to Hula, where they chartered a lakatoi, and
returned to Port Moresby. Sir Peter Scratchley hearing, when in Queensland, of
this truly heroic action, determined to mark his sense of it by conferring a
mark of distinction on the hero of the affair. Our guest Koapena, the chief of
the Aroma District, although past the prime of life, is a fine stalwart man
over six feet high, and decidedly the finest specimen of savage humanity we
have seen in New Guinea. He stoops slightly with age, but his bearing is full
of grace and dignity, and altogether he looks like a person to select rather
for a friend than a foe. He is in full native dress, <i>i.e.</i> a waist
string, plaited armlets, and head-scratcher, or five-toothed comb. His luggage
consists of a little netted shoulder-bag or knapsack, containing a lime gourd,
a stick of betel pepper and a few areca nuts, the combination of which articles
constitutes his favourite chew.</p>
<p>The steward served him dinner in the saloon as soon as ours, which we now
almost invariably take on the quarter-deck, was over. Amongst other things he
was given some tinned asparagus, a vegetable which he certainly had never seen
before. His appetite was wonderful, and he ate enough baked yams and pork to
satisfy three ordinary people. The result of this late and heavy meal was that
he could not sleep, notwithstanding the soft cushions provided for him in the
aft part of the saloon, and I was witness to a midnight conversation equally
quaint and ludicrous between this gigantic naked savage and Mr. Fort, the
General's secretary, who often prefers to do his work in the cool of the night.
The former plying his little chunan stick from his lime calabash to his mouth,
and now and then taking a chip of betel, by way of variety, watched with
curiosity the busy pen of the Secretary seated opposite, writing by the light
of three candles, in addition to the saloon lamp. Scarcely a word was spoken,
and certainly none were exchanged, the chief contenting himself with smiling
and nodding in reply to the Secretary's whispers and dumb show. This nocturnal
interview between an Oxford B.A. and a native prince is surely without
precedent. I greatly regretted that the time and place afforded insuperable
obstacles to my taking a picture of it. The warrior chief, in addition to his
other embellishments, had more than thirty crosses tattooed on his breast and
back, each of which indicates a life violently taken.</p>
<p>We landed at Parimata shortly after ten o'clock next morning, not without
difficulty, as the water is shallow, and the surf rough. Sir Peter had arranged
to visit Koapenas Village, Moapa, without loss of time, as we were to start for
Suau and Dinner Islands on the morrow. Our walk to Moapa, after leaving the
beautiful hard beach, lay through plantations of cocoa-nut trees, the road
being fringed on either side with nuts put out to sprout, forming a border two
feet high. When the roots begin to penetrate the soil, they are transplanted,
and fresh ones put in their places. The milk, which we quaffed abundantly at
every halt, is most refreshing. Each nut contains fully a pint, and the
quantity we put away I should not like to estimate. Every now and then we met
troops of people engaged at the plantations, the young men bedecked with
wreaths of flowers and twigs of bright crotons stuck through their armlets. My
dark goggles produced a sort of terrified amazement among the women and girls,
and when I took them off curiosity overcame fear, and they expressed their
wonder and surprise without stint. I put them on one of our carrier boys to
show that they were transferable, and he indicated by signs that he understood
perfectly well that they served to guard the eyes from the glare of the
sun.</p>

<br>
<b>34. Village Scene at Moapa, Aroma District</b></p>
<p>After a pleasant walk of about three miles, we neared the beach, the soil
becoming sandy and barren, and, passing the Mission House, we came upon Moapa,
a considerable village situated in a sandy flat, protected from the sea breezes
by a belt of hills covered with Pandanus trees, and timber somewhat similar to
the honeysuckle. The population of Moapa is about 600, and the houses, built
facing each other so as to form regular streets, show an order and regularity
which would not disgrace a European town. All the houses are two-storey
structures, and some of them have a kind of third floor close to the ridge. The
usual platform is in front of every tenement, but many of them have this
peculiarity, that access is gained by a sort of manhole in the floor, eight or
nine feet from the ground, and reached by a ladder, which can be drawn up into
the building at pleasure. Our host showed us with pride three different houses
belonging to him, each presided over by a separate individual in the shape of a
wife. He was, however, bound to confess that this "unicorn" team was as much as
he could drive, and that he was obliged to breakfast in one hut, lunch in
another, and dine in a third, distributing his other attentions impartially, or
an outburst of jealousy was the result.</p>
<p>In the centre of the village we found an open space or square with a
sanctuary in the middle. It consisted of a framework of logs, about three feet
high, filled with earth inside, and surmounted by a kind of scaffold, from
which half a dozen skulls, ornamented with strings of cowrie shells and
streamers of Pandanus were suspended. On the mound beneath more skulls and
other human bones were scattered. These were supposed to be the remains of a
party of <i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i> fishers, murdered some years ago by the
Aroma people. Dilapidated and repulsive looking as the spot looked, overgrown
with weeds, and ghastly with human debris, it was interesting enough to record
photographically, but the conditions rendered this impossible, the high wind
swaying about the suspended skulls in a manner which would blur any sun
picture. I offered almost any price (in tobacco) to induce the natives to go up
and steady the skulls while the picture was being taken, but nothing would
induce them to undertake the task, and most reluctantly I was compelled to
trust to the pen, unaided by the camera, for a description of this curious and
interesting spot.</p>
<p>The protection from the wind afforded by the buildings enabled me to get
some street scenes which I valued as indicative of the methodical and orderly
habits of the natives. On our way back to the ship we met hundreds of natives
who had flocked to see the big ship and its inmates, with an ulterior view of
tobacco. We halted for a brief space at Tenaori's place, and I succeeded in
picking up a few curiosities. The native teachers and their wives, on the
General's invitation, came off to the ship, and were regaled with nuts,
biscuits, and other delicacies, which they tasted probably for the first time
in their lives. Before they took their leave, presents of print, mosquito
netting, stationery, ami other useful articles were distributed.</p>
<p>On the 4th October we quitted the Aroma District for Stacey Island,
alternatively named South Cape. We gave the reef a wide berth, and came into a
stiff south-easter, which gave us a lively time of it for twenty hours, this
being the first night under steam since we made Papua. Early on Monday, the
5th, we passed Tree Point on the port quarter, and steering E. by N., left
Wedge Rock to starboard, and Rugged Head to port, when we entered the narrow
straits called Mairy Pass, formed by the mainland on the north, and Stacey
Island on the south. The scenery here is surpassingly beautiful, the most
beautiful we have yet visited. The narrowest part of the strait is not more
than a mile in width, stretching away to the far east, and is bounded by
Leocadi Island, which is crowned with a tree looking from the distance
singularly like a lighthouse. The varied tints of green on the steep rises of
Stacey Island, the deep azure of the straits, and the woody shores of Bertha
Lagoon, dotted with native villages, combined to form a picture delightful to
an artist's eye. Nothing seemed to be wanting to complete the charm of this
terrestrial paradise.</p>

<b>35. Native Houses and Graves at Suau, Stacey Island</b></p>
<p>The eye roamed from spot to spot, everywhere resting on fresh and varied
beauties. The lights developing the salient points of the glorious panorama of
mountain, wood, and water, constantly changing from the shadows cast by
flitting clouds. The mountains in the background rise to 3,000 feet above the
level of Bertha Lagoon, and are covered from base to summit with luxuriant
vegetation. The spot will always rest in my memory as the most beautiful I ever
saw. The lagoon at its mouth is about 1,500 yards across, but widens
considerably within. At 9 a.m. we anchored 300 yards from shore opposite the
Mission Station of Suau, the native name for Stacey Island. The South Cape
Missionary having died some time previous, his duties devolved upon his widow,
who discharged them most efficiently, and to the entire satisfaction of the
mission authorities. Anxious to preserve some solar pictures of the exquisite
scenery around, I took the dingy immediately after breakfast, and paddled
ashore to the westerly point of the lagoon, in company with Mr. Rossiter, our
second officer, who was deputed to superintend the cutting of a load of grass
for our sheep on board.</p>

Shores of the Lagoon&mdash;Under Way&mdash;The Brumer Group&mdash;Rendezvous at

<p>Leaving our grass cutting party, Mr. Bubb (my assistant) and myself,
accompanied by Mr. Smart, our third engineer, wended our way to Garihi, a
village facing the straits, from which our vessel lying at anchor was visible
in the distance. We took the precaution to carry arms, but had no occasion to
handle them, as the villagers received us literally with open arms, less,
perhaps, out of feelings of platonic affection, than from ulterior views
relative to tobacco. Our guides took us to the centre of the village, where a
space about ten feet in diameter was rudely flagged with stones from the beach.
Round the outside of this pavement large flat stones were set on edge in the
ground at an angle like the backs of chairs. We were invited to be seated, and
the chiefs and headmen of the place were presented to us. I gave the old
warriors a few sticks of tobacco each, and to the women and children a dozen or
two tin plates ornamented with stamped letters, and a kangaroo in the centre.
These gifts were much appreciated, and yams, sweet potatoes and cocoa-nuts were
heaped up in front of us as return presents. We then had a smoke, and Mr.
Smart, by some conjuring tricks, in which he was an adept, first terrified, and
then diverted the simple-minded natives.</p>

<br>
<b>36. Garihi Village, Bertha Lagoon, South Cape</b></p>
<p>The wind being too high for photographing, we inspected some of the
interiors, and were amazed at the accumulation of rubbish which they contained.
They keep all the skulls of wild pigs killed in hunting, and string them on
sticks, tapering from the largest size to the smallest. These queer trophies
are put in the side of the verandah as ornaments, much as an English Nimrod
decorates his entrance hall with stags' antlers and foxes brushes. Human skulls
also find a place, but these are suspended by strings and ornamented with white
cowrie shells and tufts of grass. When swayed about by the wind, these shells
tinkle on touching each other. Immediately over the front entrance the spears
and other weapons are displayed, and one or two drums hang handy for use, while
the large conch shell used in war and when out pig-hunting is invariably found
in this part of the house.</p>
<p>A little further back the seines and crayfish nets are suspended when dry,
and the large meshed nets used in hunting are also carefully kept there. Behind
them a little fence not more than 2 feet 6 inches high, divides the house into
two apartments, the back one serving as kitchen, dining-room, and sleeping
place. Their women perform the cooking and other household duties, the front
apartment being used by the men, should the weather be rainy or boisterous. The
houses in this locality are only one storey high, and the floor is on a level
with the eaves of the roof. The interior consequently is triangular, and a man
can only stand upright in the very centre, as all sorts of household utensils
are inserted between the rafters and thatch, and overhead one or more shelves
carry suspicious looking bundles containing the smoke-dried bones of deceased
relatives. I was presented at my request with several of their conch shells,
and in exchange for a long knife secured a well-made net used for
pig-hunting.</p>
<p>On our walk to the beach we noticed a large war canoe, made of an immense
log of very buoyant timber, with the sides regularly built up of large planks
of the same wood. The stem and stern were rudely ornamented with carvings and
painted with red, white and black pigment, the only three colours in use among
them. On one side of the canoe a log was attached as an outrigger, enabling the
craft to live in a pretty heavy sea. As we had outstayed our appointed time,
and there was a possibility of our own boat having returned without us, we
determined to go back in this canoe, the native who had sold me the net
agreeing to put us on board. Although wind and tide were both dead against us,
we reached the ship safe and dry, though not without danger, the overloaded
canoe leaking to such an extent as to keep a boy constantly bailing.</p>
<p>After bath and luncheon we landed near the Mission Station on Stacey Island
with our guns, and procured the services of two or three native boys to guide
us up the peak, which is about 800 feet high. After a walk of half a mile along
the beach we turned sharp up the precipitous side of the cliff, whose ascent
was anything but easy. The formation is conglomerate, broken up into the most
fantastic shapes, the roots of the trees interlacing with the stones,
furnishing facilities for climbing the steep track. Bright plumaged parrots,
satin birds, and New Guinea magpies flew about in numbers, and the tracks of
wild pigs were everywhere visible. Our route lay up the bed of a stream almost
dry at this season. In some places, however, the ascent was so steep that I was
under the necessity of giving my gun to a little native boy, whose bare feet
enabled him to negotiate the obstacles without the slipping and stumbling
incurred by the heavily shod white man. About six hundred feet above the sea
level we met a native woman carrying a heavy load of yams on her back in the
usual net, secured by a band across her forehead, the weight thus being divided
between her spine and her hips. A little higher we skirted the plantation where
she had been working, the freshly disturbed earth indicating the spot whence
the yams had been taken.</p>

<b>37. Boating Scene, Bertha Lagoon and Cloudy Mountains in the
Distance</b></p>
<p>Emerging from the thick undergrowth, we came upon a slope covered with
coarse grass eight or nine feet high, and in places entirely concealing us from
view. After passing another plantation where taro was cultivated and thriving,
we came to a rocky place near the summit, and sat down for a rest and smoke.
Eastward was another peak about a hundred feet higher, but a shower of rain
coming on, we took shelter in a little thicket, and left the ascent of the
highest point to some more energetic explorers. The rain soon passed over, and
the dispersing clouds disclosed a wonderfully beautiful tropical panorama,
forest, sea, and mountains being spread before us in endless variety. To our
right, Mairi Pass and Catamaran Bay; and, far away in the distance, the waters
of Milne Bay. Beneath our feet lay Bertha Lagoon, the Cloudy Mountains rising
from its edge, and the hills of Farm Peak, Moudiri, and Debadeba, the country
of the Cannibals, sharply outlined by the setting sun, stretched away to our
left.</p>

<b>38. Magiri Village, Bertha Lagoon, South Cape</b></p>
<p>To the southward we could plainly see the narrow neck of land, part of
Stacey Island, which forms what is marked on the chart South Cape. It is in
fact much narrower than indicated on the map, being in one place not more than
a mile in width from beach to beach. The immediate foreground to the north
consisted of the densely wooded slope we had just ascended, which hid our
vessel and the mouth of the Lagoon from view. On our way back we bagged half a
dozen different kinds of birds, but a beautiful black scrub pheasant we lost in
the jungle, where even the sharp eyes of our native boys were at fault. We
returned to the ship at 6 p.m., and early next morning I went ashore to attempt
some photographs, as our departure was fixed for 11 a.m., and I was unwilling
to leave this lovely locality without some views. Fortunately the wind had
moderated, and I was able to get some very characteristic pictures, both of
scenery and houses, with native groups. The people were most obliging, and did
everything in their power to please us.</p>

<b>39. Group and Native House, Mairy Pass, Mainland of New Guinea in the
Distance</b></p>
<p>There is little or no timber on Stacey Island available for building
purposes, but at Bertha Lagoon all along its Eastern shores and close to the
water's edge, we found quantities of red and white mangrove, and huge Malava
trees, the latter not unlike the walnut-tree in shape and foliage. The country
seemed thickly populated, and up the rugged slopes of the Cloudy Mountains we
saw many columns of smoke, indicating the presence of man. We visited some half
dozen villages, rowing across the lagoon several times, and the day being warm
drank sufficient cocoa-nut milk to float a ship. The huts, generally speaking,
had an appearance of age, a sign in itself of peace prevailing among the
various tribes. We got back to the ship at 10.30, and breakfasted before
getting under way.</p>

<b>40. Young Cocoanut Trees on Stacey Island, Farm Peak in the Distance</b></p>
<p>It appears that we have a rendezvous at Dinner Island with several
men-of-war, to inquire into and possibly punish the murder of Captain(?) Fryer,
at Hoop Iron Bay, Moresby Island. Leaving the Straits by the way we entered
them, and passing Wedge Rock on the port side, we sighted Tassai, the village
on Brumer Island. This group comprises one larger and one smaller island, with
two or three lesser islets. To the south-east, when abreast of the passage
between the two first mentioned of the Brumer group, Dumoulin Island, distant
twenty-five miles, becomes visible due east, Castori and Arch Islands, about
twenty miles away, are seen east-north-east, and Heath Island, towards which we
are heading, shows its high peak eighteen miles to the north-east. The double
island named Leocadi, with the sea breaking over the connecting reef, is
visible five miles off on the port quarter with its solitary lighthouse-looking
tree.</p>

<b>41. Platform for Dead Bodies, South Cape, New Guinea</b></p>
<p>Shaping our course through the inner passage between Heath Island and the
mainland of New Guinea, and carefully navigating the strong tide-rips that run
through it, we sighted Dinner Island at 2.20 and dropped anchor 200 yards from
the beach half-an-hour later. We are now in China Straits, and the wonderful
beauty of the island scenery surrounding us has not been overrated. Dinner
Island itself is not more than 200 feet high at any point, but is a paradise of
loveliness. To our right, in the south-west, tower the ranges of Heath Island,
1,000 feet high. Three or four miles in the opposite direction are the
mountains of Hayter Island; towards the east the hill chains of Basilisk and
Moresby Island loom in the hazy distance, and behind us towards the north the
lofty ranges of the mainland, wooded from base to summit, rise abruptly from
the shore. On reaching the anchorage at Dinner Island we found ourselves the
first at the rendezvous. The Mission Boat came out to us bringing the unwelcome
news of fresh outrages.</p>

<br>
<b>42. Naria Village, South Cape, New Guinea</b></p>
<p>It appears that Captain Miller, well known in Cooktown, had lately come to
these parts and commenced trading in <i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i> and copra. He
had built a store and temporary dwelling on an islet called Koilao, separated
from Heath Island by a channel, quarter of a mile wide and not three miles from
Dinner Island. With some mates he established several trading stations among
the islands of this Archipelago; as matters were apparently prospering he
determined to build a better house on the Island of Digaragara, opposite
Normanby Island, which contains plenty of timber suitable for the purpose.</p>
<p>Accordingly he proceeded there in his cutter, taking with him as crew an
Italian named Paolo Fidele, a Chinese cook, an Australian aboriginal and his
gin, and a native named Bonita. The party, according to Paolo's account, were
seated on the beach among a number of natives, talking matters over in a
friendly way, when a Normanby islander, a boy returned from Queensland, came up
behind and struck Miller a blow on the back of the neck with a tomahawk. Paolo
saw the native coming, but too late to put Miller on his guard, and before he
could interfere another native cut the unfortunate man's throat with a long
knife. No general massacre was attempted, and Miller was just able to walk to
the boat when he expired from loss of blood. Paolo states that he fired at the
first aggressor but apparently without effect.</p>
<p>The cutter then put off and made for Milne Bay, where Miller had a branch
store, to warn a young Englishman named Cotterill and a Chinaman in charge of
their danger. They brought Cotterill off with them, but the Chinaman could not
be induced to leave. The cutter then proceeded to Dinner Island, where Miller's
body was decently interred near the Mission Station, and the party being
apprehensive that their lives were still in danger left on the morning of our
arrival for Teste Island, where the natives are known to be friendly.</p>
<p>The "Diamond" not having yet arrived, the General decided to proceed next
day to Teste Island to collect evidence for the identification and punishment
of the murderers. We accordingly started at 7 a.m. on the 8th October, weather
showery and cool, wind south-west and sea smooth. An hour later we passed
Blanchard Island and noticed a small island near its eastern extremity, covered
with beautiful grassy slopes and having a cocoa-nut grove at the end opposite
Blanchard, while at its eastern extremity gigantic Casuarina trees reared their
feathery branches against the sky. At 8.30 we passed Beehive Island, and
sighted Bell Rock and Teste Island. Hayter and Moresby Islands were on our port
side, with heavy clouds hanging on their mountain tops. At 9 o'clock we opened
up the entrance to Fortescue Straits formed by Margaret and O'Neil Islands, and
separating Basilisk from Moresby Island. We next passed Hoop Iron Bay, where
Captain Fryer was so recently murdered.</p>
<p>A cutter which we sighted and supposed to be the craft we were in pursuit of
turned out, on closer acquaintance, to be a rock which bore a singular
resemblance to a boat, the illusion being heightened by a solitary tree growing
on its side, which looked from the distance like a flag. The name of this
curious island is marked in the chart as "Foolscap Rock." Teste Island, with
Bell Rock quarter point to the westward, lay seven miles ahead, and at 11
o'clock we dropped anchor midway between the land and a huge boulder called
Boat Rock. The tides here are very strong, and the under current is so swift
that a sinker weighing over two pounds attached to a fishing line would not
fetch the bottom. On landing we found two cutters, belonging to the unfortunate
Captains Miller and Fryer, the former of which had arrived the day previous
with Paolo Fidele and the rest of the party.</p>

<b>43. On the Beach, Teste Island, Kissack's trading Canoe, Bell Rock and
Cliffy Island in the Distance</b></p>
<p>A neatly built house, with the Union Jack flying from a pole, stood near the
beach, and I was surprised to find in the proprietor a young man named Kissack,
a photographer, formerly owning a studio in Victoria Street, Hotham, a
Melbourne suburb. He told me that the doctors advised him to give up
photography as the worry connected with that profession was sure to kill him.
So after a spell in a Queensland labour ship as Government Agent, he settled
down on Teste Island as a trader, making a tolerably good living by entrusting
trade articles to the Teste Island boys, who barter them in the Louisiade
Islands and bring back cocoa nuts and <i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i> in return for
tobacco, pipes, and knives, the market quotations at that time being
twenty-eight old cocoa-nuts for one stick of tobacco. By the time the fruit is
husked, sliced and dried, and bagged, and the freight paid to Queensland, the
profit has dwindled to a very modest sum, and I could not but reflect that with
the risk thrown in of being murdered on the slightest provocation the traders
deserve all they can make.</p>
<p>Meantime the General had been pursuing his inquiries at the Mission House,
the result being that Paolo Fidele and his mates are to return with their
cutter to Dinner Island, proceed with us to the scene of the outrage and
identify the perpetrators if possible.</p>

<p>On our return to Dinner Island, where we dropped anchor on the morning of
the 10th October, we found H.M.S. "Diamond" awaiting us, and the "Haven"
arrived a couple of hours later bringing a small mail from Australia, which
afforded me the first news I had received since leaving Sydney. Visits were
exchanged between Captain Clayton, Commander of the "Diamond," and H.M. High
Commissioner, a salute of honour being fired to the terror and astonishment of
the natives on shore and the consternation of our poor cat.</p>
<p>The next day being Sunday I determined to make an excursion to some of the
adjacent islands. Our second officer, Mr. Rossiter, and Mr. Smart, the third
engineer, offered to accompany me with Captain Lake's permission, and two
sailors volunteered to take an oar each. Thus our crew, including self and
assistant, was composed of six men all well armed and quite prepared for any
adventure that might befall us. We set out at daybreak taking a keg of water,
some biscuits, and other pro visions ample for the day. My photographic
instruments were of course not omitted, but it turned out too windy to use them
to advantage.</p>
<p>We first made for a little island about mid-way between Samarai and the
mainland of New Guinea. If I recollect rightly, it is named on the chart Middle
Island. This little spot, though probably not containing more than ten acres of
land and at the highest part not above fifty feet higher than the sea level, is
covered with an endless variety of tropical verdure, from the graceful cocoa
palm to the wonderful orchid. The rocks and the gnarled stems of the Malavas
near the water's edge are now covered with many kinds of dendrobia, some of
them in flower; I noticed one beautiful species, white waxlike pendant
blossoms, and another with green flowers delicately shaded from olive to brown
in the centre.</p>
<p>Shells in profusion were found on the beach; Mr. Smart, being an ardent
conchologist, was in his glory, and we experienced some difficulty in getting
him to leave the new wonders he was discovering at every turn. A gigantic white
convolvulus attracted our attention, and I collected about a dozen kinds of
seeds in this locality. Some of each kind I gave to Mr. Guilfoyle, the Director
of the Melbourne Botanical Gardens, on my return.</p>
<p>It was about 7 a.m. when we pulled away towards Heath Island. We had to row
hard to cross a swirling tide-rip, and it took us nearly two hours to reach the
smooth water of the little straits that separate Heath Island from Bonarua
Island, where Miller had erected a copra station not long before his untimely
death. The place was then in charge of a family of natives from Heath Island.
The Heath Island natives are reputed cannibals, and were said to be at war just
then with a tribe from a neighbouring shore. But as we were not actually
forbidden the place we made up our minds to visit a few of their villages.</p>
<p>Near Miller's store we landed and lit a fire to boil a billy of tea and have
some breakfast. We were soon noticed, and the natives flocked around us both
from the little island we were on, as also from the shores of Heath Island
opposite. There were men, women, and children among the crowd, and they
certainly appeared a most peaceful lot of people. After breakfast Smart amused
them with his conjuring tricks while we inspected Miller's Store. Several tons
of dried cocoa nut (copra) were stacked up there ready for shipment, but the
industrious owner now rested peacefully in his grave near the Mission Station
at Samarai, beyond all troubles and earthly care.</p>
<p>Uproarious merriment and laughter recalled us from our meditations, and
coming near our boat we found Smart excelling himself to everybody's delight.
The natives had no weapons with them, but promised if we would cross to their
village they would sell us plenty. The crossing took but a few minutes and we
were accompanied by the whole crowd. They had seen and smelt our tobacco, and
not receiving visitors often were all the more anxious to trade with us. I
asked, and was given permission to inspect a number of their houses, and
allowed to handle anything I pleased. On visiting native houses it is
absolutely necessary to observe a certain amount of etiquette to avoid giving
offence. For instance, I would never dream of entering a house without first
inquiring for the owner and obtain his permission to enter. In most cases this
is readily given.</p>
<p>We had no interpreter on this occasion, and had to manage as best we could
with signs and gestures. We came upon flagged places such as I described at
Garihi. I interrogated by signs what these places were used for, and they
seemed reticent to explain. I had a suspicion that they were used in connection
with their cannibal feasts, and in order to facilitate explanation, I first
pointed to the flags, and then taking up Smart's immense bare arm, I made a
movement as though I would take a bite of it. They understood my meaning
evidently, for they burst out into immoderate laughter, especially when I,
following up the strain, took out my long hunting knife and pretended to kill
Smart, suggesting meanwhile to them to get a fire ready to roast him.</p>

<br>
<b>44. Paddles, Native Ornaments, and Implements from the Neighbourhood of
Dinner Island and China Straits</b></p>
<p>We visited seven villages during the day, and not to weary the reader I must
omit many interesting incidents. We did a roaring trade with tobacco in
exchange for weapons and implements. There were lots of skulls hanging up, more
or less fractured, which we might have had, and very little persuasion
accompanied by tobacco would have secured a few bundles of the smoke-dried
remains of their ancestors. But I was chary about bringing these interesting
objects on board. We had four or five on the sick list and, under these
circumstances, a collection of human skeletons would scarcely have been
considered an acquisition.</p>
<p>We returned on board at sundown, after two hours' smart rowing against wind
and tide, having travelled over about twenty miles of land and water, but we
counted the trouble for nothing as against our interesting excursion and the
considerable additions made during the day to our ethnological collections.</p>
<p>On Monday, the 12th October, the little flotilla hove anchor and left Dinner
Island, the "Diamond" and "Raven" preceding, and the "Governor Blackall"
following in their wake. The naval procession up China Straits possessed a
certain dignity and solemnity, intensified by the nature of the errand on which
it was despatched. The lovely surroundings were lighted up by the sun, which
broke through the clouds soon after starting and dispersed the haze hanging
over the land. The dangerous navigation rendered caution necessary, and we
threaded our way through the coral reefs with the greater care from the want of
a reliable chart, no adequate survey having yet been made. On our way up the
Straits, H.M.S. "Dart" met us and signalled that she had Diaveri, Captain
Miller's murderer, in custody on board. Coming alongside the "Diamond" the
prisoner was shipped on board that vessel. It appears that the "Dart," on the
outrage being reported, went direct to the scene of the crime and, through a
native interpreter, demanded the murderer; what ensued is remarkably
characteristic of native manners. The culprit himself came voluntarily on
board, bringing presents to atone for his crime, and to make peace. The
commander of the "Dart," however, not viewing homicide in the same light, made
him a prisoner and delivered him on board the "Diamond." This duty performed,
the "Dart" left us at Cape Ventenat and proceeded with her surveying
duties.</p>
<p>Passing Normanby Island we anchored off Digaragara Island, the scene of the
tragedy, in a bay unnamed in the chart, which it has been suggested should be
called "Avenger" Bay. The native name of the locality is Negarera. Boats
containing armed parties were sent on shore from each of the three vessels
about five o'clock in the afternoon, to open up communication with the natives,
but although a number were seen ashore at the time of anchoring, no sooner did
the boats put off than they vanished like spectres into the dense forest,
whence they could descry our movements, their own being completely hidden from
view. Under these circumstances the recall was sounded, and the crews put off
for their ships at dusk. On their way several canoes were seen leaving the
shelter of a promontory and paddling with all the speed they could towards the
north to get out of the bay. Our officers thinking these might be the persons
we were in quest of, or at any rate people who could supply information, gave
orders to pursue, and a most exciting chase commenced, the boats' crews giving
way with a will, and the canoes, seeing themselves chased, paddling with might
and main for the shallow water where they would be safe from pursuit.</p>
<p>Each boat made a capture, the "Raven" laying alongside a canoe containing
three natives, while the "Blackall" boat captured another with two. The little
dingy, after a desperate pull, overtook a canoe containing two men within a few
boat-lengths of the reef, of whom one took to the water and escaped to the
shore. It was nearly seven o'clock when the boats got back, and a signalman
from the "Diamond," who was on board the "Blackall," wishing to report
progress, used the steam whistle on the Morse principle, giving short and long
splashes of sound. He certainly succeeded in making a hideous din, echoed from
all the inland hills, whether intelligible or not I cannot say, but our poor
prisoners were nearly frightened out of their wits, being too terrified to
swallow the food we gave them.</p>
<p>On the arrival of Mr. Chalmers, which took place shortly after, they were
interrogated through his means and that of Paolo, and it turned out that they
were natives of a northern district, who had been on a visit to Negarera. In
order to afford Captain Clayton an opportunity of seeing them they were kept in
custody till next morning, being stowed away for the night in the boatswain's
locker and sailroom, where they must have spent a most miserable night. As they
had no information to impart when taken on board the "Diamond" they were sent
ashore with a few presents and dismissed. Early next morning, the 13th October,
the General and Captain Clayton started on a cruise of inspection round Cape
Ventenat, to the village whose inhabitants were known to have participated in
the murder of poor Captain Miller, I profiting by the occasion to borrow the
dingy to go ashore and take some views. I found, however, an insurmountable
coral reef outlying the whole of the land, and as leaving the boat and thus
cutting off our retreat was not to be thought of, we contented ourselves with
admiring the marvellous marine formations over which our boat drifted.</p>
<p>A party of natives, some ten in number, waded out towards us but could not
be persuaded to approach closely. At length my assistant met them half way, and
giving them some tobacco, with some difficulty induced one of them to trade a
spear, which he fetched from shore and, though with great hesitation, brought
to the boat. At this point and while we were negotiating for some sea urchins
to be got out of the clefts of the coral reef, we were signalled for from the
ship, as it was thought dangerous to trade with the natives during the existing
state of affairs. Later in the morning Captain Lake, with two armed boats'
crews, went ashore, pulling round Cape Ventenant and landing at the village,
and I was allowed to accompany him, and was fortunate enough to get several
good views of this interesting locality. This is the spot which was shelled
next day and the houses destroyed, it being the settlement nearest to
Digaragara Island, where poor Miller was murdered. The few huts along the beach
were deserted, but the smouldering fires showed how recently they had been
tenanted, and we had no doubt the natives were watching us from their hiding
places. In the afternoon Paolo Fidele and two native interpreters were sent
ashore, and succeeded in interviewing the old chief, who resolutely refused to
come on board, and said it was impossible to give up the accomplices as they
had taken to the bush. He further pleaded that the man Diaveri, who actually
committed the deed, had gone on board of his own free will to make atonement,
and nothing further having been seen of him since he naturally concluded that
he had been killed. According to Normanby Island law, the culprit had done all
in his power, and having offered native jewellery in value equal to the life he
took, he fully expected to have squared matters. The Chief, from his point of
view, thought that our party had treated Diaveri treacherously, and steadfastly
refused to have any more parley unless the man was returned. Finally, he
ordered interpreters and all to quit the island. Our people withdrew, for there
was certainly no use in prolonging the interview.</p>
<p>Still, as punishment was considered due according to our laws, Sir Peter and
the Senior Captain of the Squadron determined to shell the village near which
the murder was committed. This, as stated above, was done next morning. Three
shells, one of which exploded before reaching the shore, were thrown, to warn
any stragglers to clear out. The "Diamond" and "Raven" then sent an armed boat
each, and fired a few huts. Signals were then given to proceed on our cruise,
and no sooner had we shaped course than the natives appeared on the beach
again. We closely scanned their movements through the glasses but could not
discern any signs of distress. I do not think a single native was hurt during
the fracas; in fact, the Commanders never intended to take life, but simply to
administer a wholesome lesson. Another incident happened on the previous day
which I must not forget to mention.</p>
<p>During the interview with the old chief the interpreter from Dinner Island
recognized among the bystanders, from his red hair, a man named Baelala, who he
made certain had taken an active part in the murder of Captain Fryer at Hoop
Iron Bay, and so positive was he that it was determined to capture and take
Baelala on board. The arrest was cleverly effected on trading being commenced,
and he was shipped on board the "Diamond," handcuffed, and a sentry placed over
him, his wretched wife making the beach resound for hours with shrieks of
terror and grief.</p>
<p>On reaching Hoop Iron Bay a couple of days afterwards, it was found that the
interpreter had made a grievous mistake. A party landing to parley with the
natives, the real Baelala turned up. There could be no mistake this time, as
the narrative will show, and to make amends it was determined to send the
innocent man back to his home immediately. The mistake was interpreted to him,
and after being loaded with presents, Mr. Chalmers personally conducted him to
Negarera Bay, the "Raven" being told off for that duty. The joy of his poor
wife and friends on his return may be better imagined than described.</p>
<p>After the punishment dealt for the outrage at Digaragara, the fleet
proceeded to Slade Island, Engineer group, to inquire into the circumstances of
the murder of a trader named Reid. It was found, however, that this man had
been rather a lawless fellow, who for a long time set all native rules and mere
common decency at nought. Sir Peter, considering that his fate had been brought
about by his bad conduct, decided not to take any further steps in this matter.
Hostilities being expected, I was not allowed to land the day we arrived, but
matters being amicably settled, enabled me to get a characteristic village view
before leaving next day. The houses here being differently built to any place
we yet visited, I was very pleased to secure this picture. Many returned
Queensland boys were met with here, Mr. Romilly being recognized by all who
came on board, having been in charge of the "Victoria" on her cruise to return
the natives, who had been labouring on the Queensland Plantations.</p>
<p>The Slade Island affair being thus disposed of, we steamed westward, and
soon reached Moresby Island. We anchored about mid-day at Hoop Iron Bay, where
the above-mentioned episode with Baelala took place.</p>

<br>
<b>45. Village at Slade Island (Engineer Group)</b></p>
<p>Relations here with the natives were not considered safe, and much to my
chagrin I was not allowed to land. Not lying far from shore, I could see
several beautiful spots just fit for the camera, and to the west of the ship
there stood the skeleton of an enormous Malava tree, its bleached limbs
standing out distinctly against the bright green of the tropical forest. The
scene reminded me of part of a certain picture by Dor&eacute;, and I felt I
could have braved a whole village of natives to secure a negative of it. But
both Sir Peter, and afterwards Captain Clayton, were inexorable, and much
against my inclination I had to stay aboard.</p>
<p>Before leaving Hoop Iron Bay, the real Baelala gave a minute description of
how Fryer was murdered. This will be found amongst the official records of the
trip, and need not here be repeated. But an episode from Baelala's life, which
he related to us, will not be out of place. It appears that some years ago a
trader, whose name I have forgotten, took Baelala to Sydney, and there
exhibited him in a tent for money. When the novelty had worn off, and no more
could be made out of the poor savage, the unscrupulous fellow simply turned him
adrift. For some weeks the Papuan led a precarious existence, picking up bits
of food from even the dust-pans and gutters, sleeping about the wharves in any
corner he could find. After a while a publican in that neighbourhood took
compassion on the homeless man, and in return for various small services fed
him and gave him a place to sleep. This affair got talked about in Sydney, and
Baron Miclohon Maclay, who passed through at that time, chanced to hear of it.
Like a good Samaritan the Baron took charge of Baelala, and eventually brought
him back to Moresby Island, on his way to the North Coast of New Guinea.</p>
<p>Towards noon on the 16th October, we anchored again at the roadstead of
Dinner Island. Next day the "Harrier" arrived from Cooktown with the Australian
Mail. It brought me rather distressing news. My wife's health, delicate always,
had become worse, and grave fears were entertained. Though in her own letter
there was nothing to cause immediate alarm, my friends urged me if possible to
return. It so happened that H.M.S. "Dart" was to leave here for Sydney on the
21st to pay off, and ship a fresh crew. When I made my wish to return known to
Sir Peter, he seemed to regret the circumstances very much, and expressed the
hope that I might be able to accompany him again next season. He also kindly
promised to speak to Captain Clayton (who as senior of the station had to be
consulted) about a passage home in the "Dart." Captain Clayton consenting,
Captain Field, of the "Dart," courteously acceded to Sir Peter's wish, and I
was granted a passage home in that vessel. The time of the change in the trade
winds was approaching, and the few days before our departure the weather had
been very uncertain. I made several attempts, but only got one chance of
getting a few views of Dinner Island and Anchorage.</p>
<p>I must not omit to mention that Diaveri was ultimately taken to Port Moresby
and liberated there, the laws of the protectorate not allowing a severer
punishment than exile.</p>

<b>46. The Voyage Homeward, on board H.M.S. "Dart" (on the Job)</b></p>
<p>We left Dinner Island on October 21st, and after a most pleasant voyage
reached Sydney on Sunday afternoon, the 1st November. My ethnological
collections I shipped by the "Lyeemoon" to Melbourne, but my negatives,
numbering about 128, I took for safety sake with me to Melbourne by rail,
arriving on November 3rd, in the middle of the bustle and traffic of Cup Day.
On reaching home I found the wife's health considerably improved, though not
quite restored.</p>

<p>The closing scene of the expedition I was not privileged to witness, but by
the great kindness of Mr. Chalmers I have been supplied with a full account of
what occurred between my departure in the "Dart," on the 21st October, and the
lamented death of Sir Peter Scratchley on the 29th of the following month. That
I was spared this painful episode I am thankful. I give an abstract of Mr.
Chalmers' narrative in his own words. It commences with an account of a visit
to the Killerton Islands, on the 21st October, in consequence of a hostile
attitude of the natives of Bon being reported.</p>
<p>On the landing of the General and myself, Mr. Chalmers says, all the natives
disappeared. Soon one old man, their chief, came out weeping bitterly, and
explained the cause of his grief to be the refusal of his men to appear and
show the friendliness with the white men and teachers, as they had no quarrel
with them, but only with the natives of Barabara. I certainly believed in the
sincerity of his professions, and subsequently walked over the largest of the
group, finding in some parts good plantations, a lagoon at the east end, and a
very good mission station at the west. On the 22nd we returned to Dinner
Island, and on the 23rd anchored between Dufaure Islands and the mainland in a
very fine harbour, which it is proposed to call Port Scratchley. In the
afternoon we landed, and, after meeting the good old Chief Mendi (since dead),
we strolled into the thick tropical bush with which the island abounds. From
sea level to summit it is covered with dense scrub, greatly impeding
exploration. The "Ellengowan," which arrived this day from Cooktown, brought
the ships' mails, which rejoiced all on board.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the 24th, we weighed anchor and proceeded to the Juliade
Islands, where the "Blackall" and "Diamond" remained, the General and myself
going on board the "Raven" to Port Milport, the scene of the murder of Captain
and Mrs. Webb. The object of sending one vessel only was to invite a collision
with the natives. As soon, however, as they saw the ship they commenced
clearing out, and sought shelter in the scrub behind the villages, where it was
impossible to follow them without great risk and with no reasonable probability
of any substantial result. As they persistently declined to show themselves,
the villages where the skulls of the victims were said to be were shelled and
destroyed on Monday morning.</p>
<p>This step, I have since heard from Toulon, has had a very good effect, the
people being thoroughly frightened and sorry for their conduct, without
indiscriminate and unnecessary effusion of the blood of not only men, but women
and children who, in all probability, took no part in the outrages. Although
these cannot be defended, much less exculpated, it must be borne in mind that
Captain Webb and his wife owed their fate to their own rashness. They were
warned not to venture among the natives of this island, who were known to be
treacherous and unfriendly, and as the result of their temerity they were
attacked and killed soon after setting foot on shore.</p>
<p>After the return of the "Raven" to Port Milport, the "Blackall" steamed to
Aroma, where Koapena was taken on board, and the three vessels rendezvoused in
Cloudy Bay, proceeding thence to Colombier Point, where the village of Dedele
formerly stood but was destroyed a few years back by H.M.S. "Beagle." Our
object was to open up communications with the natives and make the bay safe for
<i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i> fishermen. However, although we found some small
lean-over huts, showing that the people are beginning to return, we saw no
human beings, and had to content ourselves with sending peaceful messages
through the Aroma people, to the effect that we should call again and hoped to
see them. In the evening the "Blackall" left for Port Moresby, and I
accompanied the General on board the "Diamond."</p>
<p>Next morning, October 30th, an armed party was landed from both vessels and
marched from Keppel Point to Moapa for the purpose of hoisting the flag. Before
this ceremony was performed Captain Clayton insisted on the skulls of the
murdered Chinamen being taken down and buried, which was done by the teachers,
as no native dared touch them. This being done Captain Clayton and the General,
accompanied by Koapena, followed by the other officers, marched to the chief's
house where a flagstaff had been erected, and Captain Clayton addressed the
chief and people in the following terms:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Koapena and people of Aroma! On behalf of Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen
Victoria, I have come here to hoist this flag to-day. It will be to you a token
of friendship and an emblem of peace, and in all future dealings with her
people you will keep a kindly remembrance ever before you. If at any time the
white man should offend against your customs, you will at once report the
matter to the proper authorities, and they will see that justice is properly
dealt towards you. Rest assured that Queen Victoria will ever regard you as her
own children, and as she cherishes her children so will she cherish you, and
bear in mind that when the white man comes among you, you must treat him well,
and on no account interfere with him, always remembering that the ceremony you
have seen performed this day is the abiding emblem of peace and lasting good
will. God save the Queen!"</p>
<p>The Union Jack was then hoisted, a <i>feu-de-joie</i> fired, and the
"Diamond" gave a royal salute of twenty-one guns; the band playing the National
Anthem. Great enthusiasm and excitement prevailed among the natives, of whom
some 3,000 were present, and no dissatisfaction of any kind was evinced. We all
then marched back, followed by a great crowd showing the most friendly
disposition, and when about half way to the ship an invitation from Koapena was
conveyed to Captain Clayton that all should sit down and take refreshment. This
hospitality was accepted, and soon native lads were seen climbing trees in all
directions and throwing down cocoa-nuts, which were opened and handed round by
others, while Koapena, sitting on the platform of his plantation, superintended
all the proceedings.</p>
<p>After this interesting episode he came on board the "Diamond," and was much
interested in all he saw. He made an earnest application for the release of the
prisoner Diaveri who was on board, and begged that he might not be hung. In the
evening we left Aroma, and, steaming slow all night, were off Port Moresby in
the morning of the 31st October. The following day the "Blackall" left for
Townsville with Mr. Askwith, who was much prostrated by fever, the General and
his private secretary remaining on shore.</p>
<p>The High Commissioner being anxious to visit inland, and if possible to get
as far as Sogeri, where H. O. Forbes had his head camp, a party was formed, and
on Wednesday, the 4th November, started at daylight. The sun was very hot by
the time we got to the creek, where we decided to breakfast. About 1 p.m., when
the south-east breeze found us out, we started for the nearest Koiari village,
Sadara, where we arrived about 4 p.m. We pitched our camp on a spur about one
mile from the village. The General was tired, but nothing much. After dinner he
got to his hammock, and was soon asleep.</p>
<p>The next morning we were away by dawn, and reached the foot of the Astrolabe
about 9.30, where we breakfasted. After a rest we ascended the mountain at
Variata, 2,500 feet, and there we remained some time. It was cheering to see
the General in such good spirits and splendid walking trim. We walked leisurely
into Taburi, where we arrived about 3.30 p.m. About 5.30 Mr. Forbes arrived on
his way to Port Moresby. We arranged with him he should return with us to
Sogeri, and all come to port the following week. We all sat long after dinner
chatting, and the most lively of the party was the General. The next morning we
were away early, and after crossing the river about three miles inland of
Taburi, we kept on until mid-day, having had breakfast at camp in the
morning.</p>
<p>In a pleasant shade by a small stream we rested, and had something to eat.
Accompanied by Mr. Sharpe (a young missionary), who was one of the party, I
started for Nakari, to arrange the camp for the night. Assisted by the people
of the village, we soon had tents up and water boiling. About five the General
and his party came in just in time to avoid heavy rain, the first we have had
in all our wanderings. We got a pig from the chief, which greatly pleased our
carriers, and added new life to the camp.</p>
<p>The following morning, after breakfast, we struck camp, and got speedily
into marching order. It was fine, bright weather, and the ground being less
difficult than hitherto, we succeeded in reaching Sogeri before nightfall. On
our way Mount Owen Stanley had been visible to its summit, while on our right
Mounts Bellamy and Nisbet marked the lay of the Stanley range till the view was
stopped by Mount Obree, whose lofty mass rises over ten thousand feet above sea
level. Mr. Forbes had sent on a native attendant of our party to warn his Malay
servants of our approach, so that we had a warm welcome, and a good set meal
ready for us by the time we had refreshed ourselves with a wash, and settled
the quarters for the night.</p>
<p>The next day was a day and "the day" of rest. The General made a careful
inspection of the station, and congratulated Mr. Forbes warmly on his
arrangements, promising material assistance for his explorations. Mr. Forbes'
house, built of native materials, stood on the steep side of a natural basin,
without doubt the crater of an extinct volcano; through it ran a small river;
on the opposite side of the crater stood the native village, backed by steep
and thickly wooded crags reaching to the summit of Mount Owen Stanley. Mr.
Forbes discoursed with Sir Peter on the explorations he had made and
contemplated, on the observations in which he was engaged, and showed the
natural history specimens he had collected.</p>
<p>The next day our party, including Mr. Forbes, started on the return journey
to Port Moresby through an undulating country, with a dry, parched soil,
stunted gum-trees, and occasional extensive patches of long, coarse grass. It
was a good hunting country, swarming with wallaby and pig. We encamped for the
night before commencing the rough ascents of the Astrolabe range, and by the
evening of the third day we reached Port Moresby. The whole journey had been
accomplished without danger, and without any serious fatigue. Our native
attendants were rewarded with presents of red cloth, fish-hooks, and tobacco,
and went off with shouts and rejoicing to the fishing village of Hula, to which
they belonged.</p>
<p>The General stayed at his quarters at Port Moresby till the return of the
"Governor Blackall" on the 15th, when he resumed command, and on the 19th
proceeded to Milne Bay, passing on the 20th into hitherto unsurveyed waters at
the head of the bay to a place called Maivara. From here to Bentley Bay, the
most southerly portion of the N.E. coast, calling on the way at Killerton
Islands, and as reports were rife of the Bentley Bay natives and their
antagonism to white men, and feeling sure it was a mistake, we arranged a party
to test it. By six the following morning (21st), we left the ship and the
General, and on landing got a number of natives as carriers. We followed the
creek for some miles until we reached the Stirling Range, ascended Mount
Killerton, where we had breakfast. It was indeed cold on the top, and I was
glad when the descent on the other side was begun. It was very steep, and in
many places merely side paths like goat paths along the side of precipices. On
our arrival at the first village, the women at once got us water to drink, and
set to cooking yams, taro, and bread-fruit for us and party, several of them
bringing us fine ripe bananas. All were exceedingly friendly, and showed no
appearance of timidity. The "Raven" passing to the anchorage, we went along the
beach with a crowd of men, women, and children increasing at every village,
until we came opposite the anchorage, when there were several hundreds all
anxious to show us some kindness, supplying us with an abundance of mangoes and
cocoa-nuts.</p>
<p>We were kindly entertained on board the "Raven" by Commander Ross and his
officers until the arrival of the "Blackall" about 4.30 p.m. On going on board
we found the General in his cot on deck, and complaining of feeling out of
sorts, restless, and no appetite. It was evident from his appearance, also, he
was in the first stage of fever. Fearing he might grow worse, I suggested that
if not better in the morning we should return; Mr. Forbes and I remain at South
Cape, and he with the "Blackall" proceed at once to Australia. He decidedly
objected to go back until he had been to the Boundary or Mitre Rock.</p>
<p>On the 22nd we steamed close in shore through Bentley Bay, Bartle Bay,
Goodenough Bay to Rawden Bay, where we had anchored. The coast all along these
bays looks poor indeed, much worse even than that about Port Moresby. In many
places the mountains run steep to the sea, and in no place we saw could
settlement be made. Two peaks not on charts, but standing out and well defined,
we named Lady Scratchley Peak and Mount Service, and the nomenclature has since
been reported to the Royal Geographical Society. I again suggested to the
General we should at once return and hurry on to Australia, but to no effect,
as he insisted on seeing Mitre Rock.</p>
<p>On the 23rd we rounded Cape Vogel to the Jabbering Islands, where we
anchored. We spent several hours ashore with the natives, climbing the
sandstone cliffs, and walking back into the country, which was poor, and
terribly burned up for want of rain. The natives were very noisy, and yet very
friendly. Their houses were small, miserable huts, built on posts, with small
verandahs on the side, on which cooking was done. They have earthenware pots as
in other parts, in shape similar to Teste Island. On the morning of the 24th we
were away from our Jabbering friends, through Collingwood Bay, keeping close in
round Hardy Point to Cape Nelson, and passing many good harbours, one of which
we named Fort Harbour after our hearty, pleasant friend, the private secretary,
whose life seemed entirely devoted to the General. When in good health, he and
the General appeared as if father and son; the General becoming sick, Fort, as
a son, nursed him day and night, assisted by Dr. Glanville. Only when Fort was
near the cot was the General satisfied.</p>
<p>Two very high mountains seen to-day, and position taken, were named Mount
Romilly and Mount Ross, the former after the well-known Western Pacific
Commissioner, and the latter after the excellent commander of the "Raven."
Rounding Cape Nelson we skirted the shore of Porlock Bay to Dyke Acland Bay,
and anchored about 3.30 p.m. near to Cape Sud Est.</p>
<p>Before coming to Hardy Point, Mount Nelson was very distinct, and had all
the appearance of a crater on its east side, and certainly there were more on
board in favour of its being a living volcano than against it. Heavy clouds
hung over the top, and at various places long jets of steam appeared to rise.
The country we passed to-day seemed much better and more suitable for
agricultural purposes. Early on the 25th we were under way, and passed some
splendid looking country through Holnicote Bay, round Caution Point to Richie
Island, and on to Mitre Rock. The country was well wooded, with apparent large
plains; a very good harbour is just on our side of 8th parallel, which we
called Annabella Harbour. Some of us landed on the rock, but not having a line
with us we could not ascend. It is in German territory, just beyond the
parallel.</p>
<p>The General feeling better, seemed to enjoy the sight of the boundary. There
was no time to lose, so without anchoring we went round and away full speed to
the south-east, anchoring in Holnicote Bay. On the morning of the 26th, it
being impossible for our good captain to see his way amongst innumerable reefs
with the sun ahead of him, we landed at a number of small islands named by us
"Glanville Islands," after our Zulu Soudan doctor. The natives were noisy and
friendly, and came out to the boat quite unarmed. They are dark, and very much
like the natives of Motumotu, only they are circumcised, which is unknown on
the south-east coast. Their ornaments were very poor, and they seemed to have
little to trade.</p>
<p>About ten we were under way, and steamed through Dyke Acland Bay, where we
saw a large river, which seemed to drain all the back country. We called the
river "Rossitter River," after our second mate. There seems a very large
mangrove fringe all round this bay. We anchored about 6 p.m. in Porlock Bay,
and the following morning at six o'clock pulled in shore, and into a large
inlet or lagoon, which we named "Clayton Inlet." We rowed up what seemed to be
a river, and were met by a noisy crowd all unarmed, and extremely anxious to
trade with us. There was no mistaking their friendliness, and we allowed them
round the boat as friends. We pulled out of the inlet, and round on to the
beach, where we landed and again met the people. They had very few things worth
trading for. They were greatly delighted with pocket handkerchiefs, and danced
and shouted when they possessed a piece of red cloth.</p>
<p>Getting on board we were under way by eight o'clock, and steaming all day we
anchored at the Jabbering Islands about 6 p.m. We did not think the General
looked worse, only he complained of feeling terribly prostrated, and at night
could not sleep. He would not take quinine in any form whatever. On Saturday
(28th) before daylight, we were under way and off for Lydia, where we arrived
about 2 p.m. We spent several hours ashore, and everywhere met with kindness.
Several boys from Queensland were here, who told us frequently, "White man no
good. New Guinea man very good;" "White man no gammon, too much fight."</p>
<p>When passing through Chads Bay, we had difficulty in getting canoes
alongside. One approaching with clothed men, our interpreter recognized boys as
some who had been returned in "Victoria," and knew they belonged to a place
where a labour vessel killed several natives and stole quite a large number. Of
the latter were some of those in the canoe.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, the 29th, the General was much worse. We arrived at
Dinner Island about 10 a.m., got mails on board, and away to Suau. When reading
his letters he seemed to revive, and spoke quite hopefully and pleasantly of
his return next year, when together we should do the north-east coast and
D'Entrecasteaux Group well, visiting every nook and corner, and making
excursions inland, meeting the vessel at points decided on.</p>
<p>At 2 p.m. Mr. Forbes and I landed at South Cape, and the "Blackall" steamed
away for Australia, we hoping that the next news would be that our good kind
General would have quite recovered, and that a quiet rest in Hobart with Lady
Scratchley and family would set him up for another season.</p>
<p>On the "Raven" coming to take us to Port Moresby, Commander Ross told us the
sad, sad news, that the General was dead, died when near Townsville&mdash;the
natives, knowing by our looks something had happened, pressed round to know,
and on being told, they too felt full of sorrow as for a friend. He was much
respected on board, and by all who met him. He was kind and true, would do his
duty, and never mind the consequences. He came rather prejudiced against
natives, he left their friend, and much interested in them. He would have done
a splendid work if only he had lived two years more, and laid the basis of a
good government that both races would have felt to be for their benefit.</p>

<b>47. "The End," Sir Peter Scratchley's Catafalque, on board S.S. "Governor
Blackall"</b></p>
<p>The remains of General Scratchley were brought to Melbourne in the "Governor
Blackall," and temporarily interred in the St. Kilda Cemetery on the 16th
December, 1885. The Dean of Melbourne and clergy performed the funeral service.
Sir Henry Loch was present in person, and all the Australian colonies.
Governmental departments, civic bodies, and learned professions were largely
represented. The pall-bearers were Mr. Fort, Captain Lyster, Lieutenant-Colonel
Sargood, Major-General Downes, Colonel Roberts, Mr. J. C. Tyler, Mr. James
Service (Premier of Victoria), and Colonel Trench. The "Melbourne Age," of
December 17th, describing the occasion, says:&mdash;</p>
<p>" The half-masted flags floating yesterday over Melbourne, the predominance
of sombre costumes among civilians, and the presence of officers bearing
mourning badges hurrying off to their rendezvous, betokened the day to be one
of sorrowful observance. The duty of the day was that of paying the last
tribute of respect to the memory of the late Sir Peter Scratchley, High
Commissioner for New Guinea, by honouring his remains with a public funeral,
attended by his Excellency the Governor in person, a special representative of
Lord Carrington, Governor of New South Wales, and deputies from all the
Australian colonies. The ministry of Victoria, the consular body, the bench,
the bar, the other learned professions, and the local forces contributed to
swell the procession, which was upwards of a mile in length, its route being
lined by thousand of serious and orderly spectators."</p>

<blockquote>I. Veata of Maiva &mdash; II. The Koitapu Tribe and their
Witchcraft</blockquote>
<h3>BY JAMES CHALMERS, F.R.G.S.</h3>
<h4>I. Veata of Maiva.</h4>
<p>Like all other savages, the Papuans are a prey to superstition. As an
example of the beliefs they entertain, and the fears they cherish, I will
narrate my adventures with a great sorcerer, a Maivan, dreaded by his
countrymen on account of the power he is supposed by them to possess. Like
other pretenders of the same class, he was himself the dupe of his own
cabalistic juggleries, and as big a coward as the simple folk who hung upon the
rites he practised. I had often heard of this man, but never met him personally
till, when in Maiva, I was presented at an inland village with a broken
crystal, and on inquiring if there were others of the same kind about, I was
informed they all came from the vicinity of Mount Yule, but that one in
particular, by common report surpassing all others, was in the possession of
Veata, the mighty sorcerer, never to be seen by mortal eye except his own, for
no other person could look on it and live. One of our teachers hearing of it,
and thinking, I suppose, it was some precious stone, offered the sorcerer
several tomahawks only to be allowed to see it. On returning to the coast I
went to my friend Miria, and asked him to use his influence with Veata to show
me his burning jewel. "Yes," he replied, "but I am afraid; I myself have never
seen it, although he is my cousin, and should he show it to you will you not
die?" "No, Miria, that cannot kill me;" and then I told him of the many charms,
fetishes, &amp;c., I had from other places. He was evidently distressed, for
after thinking the matter over, he said, "Were there only two Tamates it would
be right one to die and one to live; we have only one, and cannot get another."
"Miria, do not be alarmed. I can look on all Veata's things and know I will
live." "Well, I will ask him."</p>
<p>After some time, Veata and Miria came into the house, and, sitting down in
front of me, I asked the former if the latter had spoken to him of what I was
anxious to see. Veata looked steadily at me, and said, "My friend Tamate, I
would, but I am afraid, very much afraid. No living soul but my sister and me
has ever seen those things, and you know very frightened Maiva is." "Veata,
friend, do not be afraid, your kohu goods cannot injure me, and I alone will
see them." "To-night I will return, and you will see them, and no one but
ourselves must be in the house." "Good, friend, now do not deceive me."</p>
<p>He is a man some forty years old, about 5 feet 8 inches in height, well
made, with a peculiar anxious expression and dark restless eyes. He would have
been killed long ago, but his party is large and influential, and all of them
would rally round him, as, apart from relationship, he is the source of food
and property to them.</p>
<p>Long droughts will bring large quantities of yams, bananas, sugar cane,
betel nut, cocoa nuts, pigs, fish, tobacco, arm-shells, ear, neck, and forehead
ornaments.</p>
<p>When one is sick friends will do the same. If death follows he is blamed.
When my old friend Oa died, Veata had to leave for some time, until it was
shown by his friends that he could not have caused Oa's death, and the blame
was then laid on another.</p>
<p>This superstition is the source of constant trouble in the Gulf, and amongst
the inland tribes on the Owen Stanley Range. Last year Motu-Motu, on their
return from Port Moresby, where they had been trading with arrowroot, attacked
Keveri, a district near Cape Possession, and killed three men, themselves
losing two. Since then they have threatened to return, but were afraid of the
teachers at Maiva, and my old savage father, Semese, said he would not consent,
as he did not wish to break faith with his foreign son.</p>
<p>Four weeks ago Lese invited Motu-Motu to a large feast. A large crowd
assembled, and when the time for talk came on Keveri alone was the subject.
Many were excited and determined on fighting. When the talk was at its highest
a strange native stepped into their midst, and said, "I am a Keverian, I wish
you to kill me, or if you save me I shall lead you to Keveri. A dear friend has
been killed by a vatavata (spirit), and Keveri will not help me to revenge on
the sorcerer. I do not wish for life, but if you spare me I shall be yours."
Some said, kill him at once; Semese said, "No," and stepping over to him took
his net bag from him, giving him his, exchanged head dresses and armlets, and
then took him by the hand, saying, "You are mine, and live." He took him home
to Motu-Motu, and the following week landed him on the beach near Keveri,
telling him to make known to Keveri his great wish for peace, and that he and
his son would be found in Maiva with the teachers. Soon a messenger came in
begging Semese and his son Rahe to go out, which they did, and made friends and
peace.</p>
<p>At sunset Veata returned, looking very serious, and sitting down near to me,
he said, "Oh, Tamate, are you sure it will be right for you to look on these
things&mdash;what if you die? Where shall I go? Every tribe on New Guinea would
seek my destruction." "Nonsense, Veata, I am very anxious to see your kohu, and
you will find I live." He left me in great doubt, but I was determined not to
be done. I have had a good deal to do with these gentlemen, the most
troublesome men on New Guinea, and the same in other lands; many known as
Protestants, and hosts as Romanists. Bigoted priests, Protestants or Romanists,
are not near so easily managed as my savage friend and priest Veata, and I
thought I would yet see his articles of might, especially the burning jewel of
death.</p>
<p>The sun had long set, and a very dark night had come. I sent for Miria and
asked him why Veata did not return. "Oh, Tamate, we are all afraid; were there
only two Tamates, one to die and one to live, it would be right, but to lose
you now and through my friend." "Miria, do not be afraid, die I shall not, but
if I should there are others to take my place. Come, and we shall go to Veata."
Consenting, we started, and walked for nearly a mile, when we came to Veata's
village. At this season the Maivans turn night into day, because of the
mosquitoes. They walk and sit about and smoke all night, and sleep during the
day. In walking through the village during the day, groups on mats, dead
asleep, may be seen everywhere. Except Rakaanya, of the Humphrey group, I know
no place to beat Maiva for these annoying creatures. One of my boat's crew
said, "Their noise is loud as Rouna (a large waterfall), and their bites I
cannot describe." A teacher walking through the village one evening saw a man
killing and eating these enemies. "What, are they nice that you eat them?" "No,
but they take my blood, and I kill and eat them in revenge."</p>
<p>Veata, with his wife, was sitting on his platform in the dark, afraid to
have a light near that would draw the mosquitos. "Friend, I have come to see
your kohu, and especially the burning one." Having strongly impressed on Miria,
going along, the necessity of his assisting me, I found now I was about
attaining my object. "Tamate, you will see it, they are with my sister; whilst
with me I lost father, mother, brothers, sisters, wife and children; and, being
frightened, I gave them to my one sister to keep, and she hides them in the
earth." After a chew of betel nut we start for the sister's, where he begs to
remain awhile to follow us in a short time. On arriving at the Mission House
Miria told the natives about to keep away as Veata was coming with his kohu.
The teacher's wife had to leave the house, and I with the teacher long waited.
The wife, tiring of the long delay, returned and informed us it would be long
ere he came, as he was "going through his prayers," and there sure enough he
was, on a platform near our house, busily engaged with his bags in front of
him. After a long stay Miria entered and saw the house cleared, then Veata
came, put down my curtain that makes my end of the house private, asked me to
take the light inside, showed me where I was to sit and not lean over his
things. Again he began, "Tamate, I think it is good and no harm will come to
you; but do not show them to any Maivan or Motuan."</p>
<p>" Yes, it is good, and no harm will be mine." Muttering hurriedly to
himself, he pulled carefully each finger, cracking all, till he came to the
ninth, no crack, then more earnest muttering, and an appealing look to me,
"Tamate is it good?" "Yes, Veata," A long, hard pull, and a crack, and then the
tenth&mdash;all right. In some places the pulling the fingers signify
friendship, and everywhere it is done by friends to any one taken suddenly
sick. I remember once at Aroma, a chief not much accustomed to smoking had two
or three long whiffs from a bamboo pipe; he was sitting close by me and thrust
his hands towards me; not knowing what he wanted, he turned to the other side,
and a friend caught his hands and pulled his fingers, not at all happy if one
failed to crack. The man, I found, was smoke-sick, and this was the cure.</p>
<p>I was going to ask Veata what it all meant, but he insisted on my not
speaking. The first thing produced was a small net bag containing two large
seeds; on one was a very good, clear, and well shaped crystal, and underneath
small shells to represent nose and eyes. That was the male, and the other,
unadorned, was the female. They were never spoken to but for death, and were
the cause of many deaths. He now asked me if I was afraid? "Oh, dear no, go
on." He next produced a piece of bamboo ten inches long in which there was a
black stone, basaltic, and another very small one. The one was father and the
other child; these were for seasons, and gave plenty or scarcity. In taking the
large stone out it fell, which much disconcerted him, and he had again to go
over his prayers. Next came a cone, from the end of the pandanus growth, and
made like a scent bottle. He took the lid off, and wrapped in various kinds of
weeds was another stone he handled very carefully, a co-partner with the last,
only both together produced sickness and death; the latter was a female.</p>
<p>He then laid down a small parcel done up in native cloth very carefully, and
whilst undoing it was very solemn in appearance, and muttering all the time.
Another stone was produced wrapped in weeds, with two small stones enclosed in
a network of string, and another substance wrapped up in leaves. These were of
power to make children, and were appealed to for the barren, only the women
must never see them.</p>
<p>He then said that was all. I said, "No, Veata, I want to see the bright
burning stone; but never mind just now, will you sell these?" "No." "Then put
them up and go and get the other." After a little deliberation and a good deal
of muttering, he asked what I should give him if he would sell, and on
mentioning a tomahawk, native beads, arm-shells and tobacco, he was satisfied,
and I packed my curios away, lest repentance on his part should deprive me of
them. I forgot to say that Miria was first consulted, and he was favourable to
the sale. We then went out to Miria, and I told him what I wanted, Veata left,
and in about an hour returned with a small parcel of crystals. We again
retired, and the small crystals were produced. I bought them, and then in great
secrecy he brought out a large piece of crystal quartz in a small net, and said
that was what I had heard about, and no one must look on it but myself. It was
the "death stone," and of which all Maiva was afraid. It was now getting into
the small hours of morning, and I wished my friend would go, but he lingered
long instructing me, and begging of me not to exhibit these things to Maiva and
Motu.</p>
<p>The next morning there was trouble. It was noised all over Maiva I had got
these things. My inland friends begged of me to have nothing to do with them,
our boat would sink or we should all die, or I might live, but Motu would
suffer. No one on board knew where I had them until after leaving Yule, when my
stroke asked me, and I told him they were in a box under his seat. During the
trip back he never once returned to that oar. In crossing Redscar Bay we had
dirty weather and a very dark night. It arose from Veata's stuff&mdash;throw it
overboard. No, it must not go overboard. I never had a quieter crew, and all
were frightened. They begged for a reef to be taken in. I was anxious to get to
Redscar Head by morning, and would not consent. They asked to throw some of our
food overboard, and to that I also objected, as at Maiva and Delena, they
persisted in filling the boat too full. I heard them saying amongst themselves,
"What folly to keep these things on board; he is not afraid, but what of
us?"</p>
<h4>II. The Koitapu Tribe and their Witchcraft</h4>
<p><b>KOITAPU TRIBE AND SORCERY.</b></p>
<p>As a tribe the Motuans have few traditions, and very little mythology,
although a very superstitious people. One night, sitting with a number of old
men, they told me that with the Koiari and Koitapu tribe they came from two
ancestors, named Kaimaikuku and Kirimaikapa, who came from the earth with one
female dog, which they took unto themselves. A son was born, then a daughter,
and again a son followed by a daughter.</p>
<p>The first two grew up and married, and their children numbered fourteen. Two
went far back and became the progenitors of the Koiari tribe, two went in from
the coast by the banks of the Laroge, and from them descended the Koitapu
tribe. The others all went to Eelema, where they increased. Long after a
quarrel occurred in Eelema. An elder brother desired his younger one to procure
him some sago, but the younger, intent on making a bow, turned a deaf ear to
the request. Again and again was the request made, but with the same result.
Other members of the family, knowing the eldest brother's request, went and
procured sago, but would on no account let the younger brother have any, and
threatened any who would give him even only a grain, with death. The difficulty
increased, and the younger brother decided with a good following to leave,
which accordingly they did, and arrived at Taurama (Pyramid Point), where they
long remained, increasing in numbers and strength, and finally came to
Hanuabada (Port Moresby), where they now live. They speak of themselves as "sea
natives" and the Koitapuans are "the land natives."</p>
<p>When leaving Eelema the Spirit said, "Go, but never forget me. In feast and
in dance I will be with you, and the sound of your drums will be heard by me
when I shall indeed bless you."</p>
<p>They found the Koitapu tribe a very powerful one indeed, with chiefs
innumerable, who not by fighting merely killed their enemy, but also by
"meamea" (prayer). They had not long to wait, until they found to their cost
they too were under the spell of the Koitapu tribe. Long droughts, only these
sorcerers could stop, and to get them to do so, meant pigs, stone adzes,
spears, sago, toeas (armlets), and pearl shell, and often these were given with
no good results whatever. Something was wrong, and again presents would be gone
over.</p>
<p>These Koitapuans held also the Spirits of life and death, and to keep
friends with them was one constant aim with the Motu tribe. These spirits
travelled in darkness, and would thrust a sharp-pointed instrument between
flooring, touch a sleeper, and he or she would surely sicken and die, the
latter certainly if the sorcerer was not called in and well paid. Many prefer
sleeping in the open and on the ground, so frightened are they of these
pests.</p>
<p>A fortnight ago a Motu youth killed a pig belonging to a Koitapu chief, a
fight took place, in which over two hundred people took part, and when several
got bad knocks. My friend Mabata, a great chief and sorcerer amongst the
Koitapuans, seeing his people were likely to be worsted, ran into his house,
and brought out a parcel done with native cloth, and with glaring eyes,
distended nostrils, and terribly excited, ran in and out of the crowd, tearing
the cloth, and scattering a kind of powder, and calling out "To your houses, it
is death;" and many did go to their houses quicker than they have run for many
a day, but the young men cared not, and meant to carry it on, until prevailed
on by stronger friends. Mabata is even feared by the mountain tribes.</p>
<p>The one uncompromising enemy of the Koitapu tribe is Hula of Hood Point.
When these natives are down this way and fishing, and when unsuccessful, they
at once say "Koitapu at it, let us for them," and a few years ago it meant the
death of several Koitapuans.</p>
<p>When new sago canoes come in from the West they collect splinters from each,
and the following year, when all are in the Gulf, and the time is nearing for
the return home, these sorcerers give it out that they must be considered. A
morning is set apart, and a large quantity of food is collected, on the top of
which may be seen tomahawks, beads, tobacco, toeas (armlets), spears, and pearl
shell. The sorcerer holds in his hand a piece of an earthenware pot in which
there is a parcel containing the splinters, and over which he is supposed to
"Meamea." Lost canoes are always easily accounted for by these sorcerers. They
have often tried to exorcise the white missionaries and teachers, but of no
use, and they give up, saying, "God is strong." Many in the Motu tribe have
thrown them over of late years, their revenue has been little. Very few of them
come to church yet, we are friendly indeed. My real object in writing this
chapter is for the following, which happened only a very short time ago, and
four miles from here.</p>
<p>An old widow woman with her two sons, a few years ago, left the village of
Kevana&mdash;forty miles from here (Port Moresby)&mdash;where a part of the
Koitapu tribe live, and went to Padiri to live. She was always looked upon as a
great sorceress, and her sons assisted her.</p>
<p>Unfortunately she boasted constantly of her great power, which was very
displeasing to the chief Eheita and others. During the first months of last
year we had no rain on the coast, and many of the plantations suffered in
consequence. The old lady and her sons did not try to hide their having
something to do with the drought, and for a long time were kept in food and
other things; but no rain coming, it was too much for Eheita, and he determined
to get rid of so obnoxious a personage and her sons. She was known to have a
large bag containing pieces of all kinds of food, which she kept buried near
her house. She told them she kept it to prevent rain, and to show them they had
no power, that power of that kind rested with her. Eheita must have the bag.
One morning very early he came with a pig to her, and begged her to give up the
bag and all it contained. After some hesitation one of the sons was sent, and
it was brought, Eheita taking it, and scattering the contents all round. The
pig was killed and divided, the elder son went with his wife to a plantation to
get food, the mother was under the house with a number of other women, and the
younger son in the house. Eheita with two others followed to the plantation,
and when he had done his work he would shout so that those in the village could
do theirs. On reaching the plantation he asked the widow's son for a smoke, the
man went aside to his bag for tobacco and a leaf, and whilst engaged in
preparing the pipe, Eheita rose, lifted his spear, and sent it clean through
him, the other two doing the same. He then gave the long signal shout, and
those in the village began; the old woman was soon despatched, but the son in
the house defended himself for some time, but was overcome, and done with.
Friends (?) came and took up the bodies and buried them. An influential man
from here, visiting the village the same day, was told of the murders by Eheita
himself, who also said to him, "Tell the white friends not to be angry, but I
could stand it no longer, and now it is done. I am glad, and so must be
everybody else." I send him word that I thought he should be hanged.</p>
<p>There is a place in the bush near to Port Moresby sacred to the Koitapuans,
where no one ever treads; to do so would be instant death. Such places there
were in many of the South Sea Islands. The name of this Koitapu place is
Varimana. Long ages ago mighty men went inland to Sogeri, and carried away a
very large stone, on the way down many died, and when it arrived near the coast
range the tribe, as a whole, begged it should be left at Varimana lest all
should be exterminated.</p>
<p>Long after it was carried in to the Koiari, and they too died in large
numbers. Again it was returned, and buried at Varimana close by a young tree;
the tree has grown very large, and now the stone is quite covered by it, but no
one ever goes near it. The stone before burial was carefully wrapped in native
cloth, and bound round with well made twine.</p>
<p>For many generations, the old people of Rarotonga spoke of a stone, te
nooanga a Tari&mdash;Tans seat&mdash;that was long, long ages before covered
over by a large Tamanu tree, close to the Mission grounds. The grounds were
sacred, and none carelessly trod there. To approach was the priest's place, and
he only uncovered and crouching. When a limb of the tree fell, some one of the
chief's family should die, and on several occasions such was the case. In the
year 1867 the tree itself fell, and soon after the King Daniela died, leaving
office to my friend Abela. When it was known the tree was down people from all
parts came in to see for themselves the truth or falsehood of many generations,
and there, sure enough, was the stone with the short bark scar. Many times I
have seen it and sat on it. Abela gave me Tuarca (name of large tree) to do
with as I liked, only he could not assist in cutting it up. Having at the time
many students, fine young men, anxious for work, they in their odd hours cut it
up into logs, and the school children sledged up to Mission ground. Only the
root was left, which was afterwards used in burning lime. A few months passed,
and I gave orders one morning after classes to roll out the best log, and get
it over the sawpit. This was soon done, and I had just returned to the house,
when a native came running to me, saying, Makea Abela was dead. The night
before I spent an hour with him in front of his house, and he was then in
excellent health. That same morning I heard of him threatening some of his
people. I ran over and found him in the bush quite dead. He died of heart
disease. Many natives said it was Tuarea. Ah, well, we shall make his coffin
from it. I ordered the morning's log to be rolled back and dug out for a
coffin. The stone and tree superstition is very common, in Eastern
Polynesia.</p>
<p>Although the Motuans fear the whole Koitapu tribe, there are two men of that
tribe living in Redscar Bay they fear more than all the rest. Maba, of
Lokurukunu, holds great power over the north-west wind, rain and sun; and Taru,
of the same place, holds the south-east entirely in his power. To these
presents were constantly brought. When about to start for the west on a trading
voyage Maba was given a large present that he might not send the north-west
wind, and Taru as large that he might continue the south-east. When the
returning season comes, end of December or beginning of January, Taru was
appealed to to stay the south-east, and Maba to give the north-west.</p>
<p>When planting yams, the Koitapuans, holding a stone in the left hand over
the seed, pour water on the stone with the right, and allow it to fall all over
the yams to be planted, repeating very quickly the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>Asindvaridaudau, asindvaridaudau, asindvaridaudau,<br>
Huevara daudau, huevara daudau, huevara daudau.<br>
Bedovari daudau, bedovari daudau, bedovari daudau,<br>
Naevari daudau, naevari daudau, naevari daudau,<br>
Eogovari daudau, eogovari daudau, eogovari daudau.</p>
<p>When the yams are just above ground the following is repeated in the
plantation:&mdash;</p>
<p>Sinari kenikeni (repeat twice more),<br>
Hueri kenikeni (repeat twice more),<br>
Ruela kenikeni (repeat twice more),<br>
Naera kenikeni (repeat twice more).</p>
<p>Mabata, the chief of one of the Koitapu division, a great man in the tribe,
a kind-hearted fellow though a great sorcerer, has just come in whilst writing
this, and he has given me the following prayer used by him when he hears there
is going to be fighting. He says when he uses it the fighters' hands hang down
with weakness, and their knees tremble.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION
OF POTTERY TRADE.</h2>
<h3>A Papuan "Enoch Ardon," by James Chalmers, F.R.G.S</h3>
<p>Just now, as I write, the village of Hanuabada (Port Moresby), is one scene
of life&mdash;truly animated human nature from the oldest man to the youngest
bairn kicking in its net cradle, rocked by an elder brother or sister to still
its impetuous nature. Who can sleep amidst the thud, thud, of many native
hammers (long sticks) used in ship-building, or the slap, slap, of native
trowels used by women in the manufacture of native pottery? Now, what does it
mean, whence has it sprung, and what object has it? Categorical, no doubt, but
to an old stager easily answered.</p>
<p>The village within Port Moresby counts about 1,000 inhabitants, 700 pure
Motuans, and 300 Koitapuans. The former are seamen and travellers who came in
past ages from the distant west, and settling first at Taurama, Pyramid Point,
notwithstanding all its barrenness, and living principally on fish and
kangaroo, not objecting to an occasional dog. The generations rolled on, and
the newer ones think a better place can surely be found than that barren, rocky
hill, and they emigrate to this commodious harbour, perhaps the most central of
all centres in New Guinea. Plantations were made on the hill sides, and in the
somewhat more fertile valleys, on land belonging to a once powerful tribe of
sorcerers known as the Koitapuan tribe. Now this Koitapu tribe to the present
day is of note on this coast. Once they lived well back near the Koiari, owning
then as now all land back to the Laroki river, the Koiarians claiming all on
the other side. They are a people much feared because of their wonderful power
over sun, rain, heaven, and earth; north-west and south-east monsoons, these
especially are theirs. Only yesterday one old chief, an arrant blackguard from
Padiri, marched through Hanuiibada, and some occupant from nearly every house
came out to meet him with a present, a stick of tobacco, a tomahawk, an
arm-shell, or some other article of value, so that he might be friendly to the
proposed trading expedition. They are no doubt the real owners of the soil, and
it may be some day in a Land Court presided over by a British judge, they will
have much to say. By no conquest do the Motuans live here, but simply because
the Koitapuans allow them, saying, "Yours is the sea, the canoes and the nets,
ours the land and the kangaroos; give us fish for our flesh, and pottery for
our yams and bananas. What a power these Koitapuans have! midnight spirits
travel at their will, strong men are laid low by them, canoes on distant
travels never return because of them, burning sun, cracked earth, dried up
bananas, and harvest-time and famine all belong to them. Who will not try to
appease their wrath, to gain their favour? He is dead now, my old friend, Taru,
but I remember well how all along this coast he was feared, and how from far
and near they came with offerings to him. But worse than anything mentioned is
that often they cause murder, or commit it to further their dark designs. To
hang a few of them may yet become necessary, although since the missionaries
have come here they are not so exorbitant, and the others are not so blind. As
readers may know, the Motuans are at Pari, Hanuabada, Poribada, Lealea, and
Manumanu, in Redscar Bay, a tribe numbering about 2,000 only; their dialect is
spoken by about 5,000, and they being the people of commerce (the Britons of
New Guinea), through their dialect it is possible to communicate with nearly
20,000 people. The Koitapuans are to be found tacked on to the Motu tribes at
Pari, Hanuabada, Poribada, also Boera and Lealea on the east side of Redscar
Bay, and inland at Padiri and Kevana, and numbering about 2,000, very much cut
up into parties. I have never heard of the two tribes fighting, but often the
Motu tribe being the stronger has helped the Koitapuan against their enemies,
the Hulans, who come from Hood Point.</p>
<p>The Motu natives are the traders, theirs is the sea. Now it is interesting
to go back to the origin of things. How interesting it would be to know to a
certainty all origins. But we do know from out of a very distant past, so
distant that all we have comes through cobwebs of many, very many generations,
a kind of myth which many present day scholars accept before fact. Well, myth
or whatever else, here it is. Away, far away, in those hoary ages, a canoe with
several men on board went out fishing. They lowered their net and all dived;
one, named Edae, near a large rock, in which there was a cave, and into which
he looked, was seized by the spirit of the deep and kept, only his toes being
left above water. His companions wondered what had become of him, and on
looking around saw his toes, and at once tried to pull him up, but could not
succeed. Letting go, he disappeared entirely, and they returned home
disconsolate and crying all the way. When the sun was near its dipping hour,
and the tide was low, they again returned and found Edae's whole foot above
water, and had no difficulty in getting him on board, and laid him in the
canoe, crying bitterly over him as dead until near the shore, when he opened
his eyes, and told them what he saw, heard, and was told to do. It was a large
cave in which a great spirit dwelt who caught him and kept him down, so that
when they tried to pull him up by the feet the spirit just pulled him right in
and told him not to fear, but to wait patiently and hear how the hungry
north-west season might be got over&mdash;have a season of sacredness, then cut
large trees, dig them out, and when finished lash them together, then get masts
and sails, and when all is finished take all the pottery the wives and
daughters have been making on board, and sail away to Eelema.</p>
<p>On his arrival at home he told the same tale to his wife, and at once he
became sacred. His brother-in-law, Nohokinoboki, a Koitapuan, opposed his going
and said, "Why leave? I have plenty of yams, some in the house for the
North-West season, and some to plant, but Edae must go and get some sago?" He
told his wife he should be long gone, and on no account to give him up. Months
passed and he did not come; the men who accompanied him left their wives,
hoping to be soon back, and because they did not return when expected the wives
got married to others, and began to forget Edae and his party. But his wife
never gave him up, and she encouraged her daughter-in-law to hope on.</p>
<p>At last she had a dream, and saw Edae, who told her he was leaving Eelema on
his return journey. She waited a few days, and then early one morning sent the
daughter-in-law up to the highest hill to look away to the westward. On her
return she reported something on the horizon beyond Redscar Head, but could not
say what it was. Later she returned again, and after sitting awhile felt
convinced it was Edae, and the next morning was up early. The daughter-in-law
again ascended the mountain, and this time returned with the thrilling news
that it was Edae, and the lakatoi was near. Both took sticks and beat on the
floor, and shouted for joy. The people came running to know what was the
matter, when they were told Edae was coming, was near, and that very day would
anchor near his house. During the time Edae was gone his wife never allowed the
fire to go out, did not go to other houses, had nothing to say to other people,
and never bathed. Now she broomed the house, set things to rights, and had a
bath, then she anointed her body and dressed in her best. The lakatoi was
nearing, and she gave orders for a canoe to be got ready, and getting into it
she was paddled off, and when alongside the lakatoi beat on the bulwarks and
shouted, "All your wives are married again, I only with our daughter-in-law
waited till now." The men were struck dumb, and felt much pained indeed; Edae
was full of delight, and on seeing his wife broke forth in song.</p>
<p>Receiving some sago the wife returned, and set to cooking for her lord when
he should land. Great was her joy on landing, and rehearsing all she heard and
reporting what she saw. Sago in quantities far beyond her power to describe,
and all the men looking well. Soon the lakatoi anchored, and after the visiting
was got over, Edae landed amidst the plaudits of the assembled villagers,
another Columbus returning from an unknown region. The first part of the night
he spent in rehearsing in a loud voice from his house the incidents of the
journey, the people he was amongst, their kindness and anxiety to have him
remain. He wound up his discourse by an attack on the faithless wives, who were
terribly ashamed.</p>
<p>In the morning his sister-in-law, Mohokinoboki's wife, came to get sago, but
he sent her back to live on her yams. Day after day she returned, until at last
he relented, and told her to tell her husband, and not to be so bumptious in
future. When her husband tasted the cooked sago, he could do nothing but praise
Edae and condemn himself.</p>
<p>This journey to the West for sago has been continued ever since, and at
present great are the preparations. Long before daylight may be heard women
making their pottery, and a walk through the village is indeed interesting.
Some women are just returning from the clay pits with heavy burdens of clay of
various kinds, black, red, yellow, brown. Some are spreading the clay out to
dry, others are pounding with a stone the dry clay, some are damping and
kneading it, and mixing it with very fine sand. Salt water alone is used.
Others have a lump of clay, and are beginning to make various kinds of pottery.
Some have theirs half finished, others quite finished, while others are burning
theirs in large fires, and staining them with a dye made from a mangrove bark.
Every woman has her private mark, and marks everything she makes. Here is a
list of their pottery:&mdash;</p>
<p>Hodu = water vessel.<br>
Uro = large cooking vessel.<br>
Nau = dish for serving.<br>
Ohuro = large cup.<br>
Keikei = small pot.<br>
Ituru = small cup.<br>
Kebo = basin.<br>
Kibokibo = small basin.<br>
Kaeva z= pot with rim.<br>
Tohe =<br></p>
<p>The men are busy getting their canoes together, work all day, and at night
pooling them well out where the man first proposed the trip, and who is
captain, sleeps with a few others. Long ago the captain has been secured. In
the morning at sunrise the lakatoi is brought in to have her work carried on.
Four large canoes are lashed together, then bulwarks are made of leaves from
the stemless palm sewn together, and well fastened with long poles, and caulked
with dried banana leaves. A stage is made all round, so that the sailors can
work her without getting inside of the bulwarks. Masts of mangrove, with the
roots at right angles, are stepped on to the centre, and large sails made of
mats all sewn together, and shaped like crabs' claws, are fixed for working
with ropes made from the bark of the large yellow hibiscus. The anchor is a
large stone made fast with long canes, sometimes 100 fathoms in length. Fore
and alt are small houses, where the captain, mates, and boatswain sleep or
smoke. A day or two before leaving they sail about the harbour with all the
young swells, male and female in killing costumes, on board, and then they have
a hearty song, with drums beating, and bodies swaying, and the ladies'
petticoats flying about. The wind is favourable, the cargo on board, and the
pole out a mile or two to the eastward: then set sail and away, whilst friends
at home remain to weep. With a fine breeze following fast, the men most worked
are the helmsmen, three or four of them with large paddles standing aft whilst
the others are drum-beating and singing the following Hues taught Edae by the
spirit:&mdash;</p>
<p>Bokibada oviria nanania<br>
Ario visiu na verianbro<br>
Boebada eraroi nanai<br>
Trope immanai ale Dauko<br>
Eela lao mauaro diaia<br>
Pinuopa diaid iauoro nairiuovox<br>
Eela lao melarara memem.</p>
<p>There are many others, but the above is sufficient. When the port where
bound is reached, they are received with great delight, pigs and dogs are
killed for the reception feast, after which they distribute their pottery, to
be paid for when ready to take their return journey. They sleep on the lakatoi,
the shore people cooking them food and taking it to them. They ascend the
rivers, cut down large trees, and make canoes of them to take home laden with
sago. On the return journey they will have as many as fourteen and fifteen
canoes for one lakatoi. Now they go wealthier than formerly, taking with them
tomahawks, knives, bead looking-glasses and red cloth. They return with many
tons of sago, which they dispose of to Tupuselei, Kaile, Kapakapa, Hula, and
Kerepunu, these natives paying them in arm-shells, and other native articles.
They keep very little for themselves. During the time they have it the whole
settlement smells of nasty sour sago, as they like it best when it ferments, so
keep it damped in large uros.</p>
<p>A list of the places they visit for sago may not be out of
place&mdash;Oiapu, Lokea, Lese, Motumotu, Moneave, Karama, Namai, Silo, Pisi,
Kerema, Keura, Vaidala, Ileran, Orokolo, Maipua, Ukerava, Kairiu, Keropenairu,
Kaiburave.</p>
<p>The great trade on the coast and inland is pottery, the natives very seldom
making a native oven like the Maories of New Zealand and South Pacific. On the
east the most of the pottery is made on Teste Island and the islands of the
Engineer Group, that is traded as far west as Orangerie Bay.</p>
<p>Their pottery is much finer than that west, but perhaps not so strong.
Travelling west, we find the next pottery makers in Aroma chiefly at the large
village of Maopa. They supply as far east as Mailuikolu (Toulon Island), and
send a little to Kerepunu on the west, but the great supply for Kerepunu and
Hood Bay come from the Motu tribe. The Hula natives bring cocoa nuts to Pari,
Port Moresby, Porebada, and Boera, and in exchange load up their canoes with
earthenware of various kinds.</p>
<p>Pottery is made at the above-mentioned places, also at Manumanu in Redscar
Bay, and Delena in Hall Island.</p>
<p>An article of very great value to the native is the ornamental toea or
arm-shell. A few small ones are made on this part of the coast, but the best
come from the east, as far away as the D'Entrecasteaux Group. They trade them
for pottery, &amp;c., to the Dauni natives, whilst the Dauni natives sell them
again to Mailuikolu for sago, dogs, &amp;c., and these to the Aroma natives for
pigs, dogs, and canoes. The Aroma natives trade them to the Hood Bay, Kerepunu,
Kalo, Hula, Papaka, and Kamari natives for birds' plumes of various kinds, and
these again to the Motu natives for sago, and the Motuan to the Eelemaites for
sago in bulk, weighing 2 or 3 cwt. From the time of the return of the trading
canoes, the Motuans keep collecting things until the next season. The most
industrious woman, the one who cultivates best on the plantations and makes the
most and best pottery, is sure to have her husband's praise, and she "has of
the fruit of her hands, and her own works praise her in the gates."</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that in the future when a civilized power governs these
children of nature, they will not do away with the present occupations and
systems of trade, and let us hope the missionaries will remember that
Anglicising is not Christianising, and Christianising should have little to do
with Manchester. For myself I think the natives with a little bit of loin cloth
better off far than our whitewashed Europeanized, shirted and trousered
natives. Leave them alone in their trading and their pottery, and leave them
alone on their lands. Why deprive them of these?</p>
<h2><a name="ch-14" id="ch-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV. TRAVELS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF
MOUNT YULE.</h2>
<h3>By E. G. Edelfeld, M.R.G.S.</h3>
<p>New Guinea has a peculiar fascination for the traveller although it is said
to be sickly, and in the uttermost degree detrimental to European
constitutions; in which statements it is to be feared there is a great deal of
truth. Yet New Guinea possesses such a charm, or magnetic force, that a
traveller who has once been there is sure to be drawn back.</p>
<p>There is a serenity and solemn grandeur in those primitive forests,
untrodden by civilized man; danger and climatic troubles are never thought of
by the true traveller, but onward is his sole aim, and the further he plunges
into the woods in New Guinea the greater becomes his desire to penetrate into
the unknown regions of this beautiful island; it is the naturalist's paradise,
where his labours will be amply rewarded and every anticipation fully
gratified.</p>
<p>At the same time I am sorry to confess my own labours in New Guinea were not
crowned with that success as anticipated, but this was owing to various
circumstances which other travellers can avoid.</p>
<p>I shall now proceed to give a short narrative of a trip up the Hilda river.
In November, 1884, I set out from Port Moresby for Maiva, a coast village about
ten miles west of Yule Island, and in 140&deg; 40' east and 8&deg; 40' south
latitude.</p>
<p>For the reason that it was rumoured that Mr. Forbes had chosen Mount Owen
Stanley as his field of operation, I directed my attention to Mount Yule, where
I expected great results in floral discoveries; and on the suggestion of Mr.
Chalmers and Captain Liljeblad, made Maiva my headquarters, as from here it was
thought I should have easy access to Mount Yule. After a fortnight's stay at
Maiva I had so far gained the confidence of the natives that they undertook to
pilot me part of the way towards Mount Yule, and I set out with ten native
carriers. Travelling about two miles in an east-south-easterly direction
through low country dotted with mangrove swamps, and bearing the appearance of
being subjected to heavy floods, as flood-marks appeared on the trees in every
direction, I soon arrived at a village called Paihana, about five miles in a
direct line north of the coast, nearly opposite Hall Sound. The village
contained about thirty houses mostly poorly built and situated in a dense wood,
intermixed with cocoa-nut palms, and distant about one mile south of the Hilda
river. The natives were friendly and offered us cocoa-nuts and betel-nuts, the
former welcome to me and the latter to my Maiva friends. Here I observed a
custom among the natives not seen by me anywhere else in New Guinea, every male
native carried a bark blanket on his shoulder, and before seating himself would
first spread this blanket on the ground.</p>
<p>After having a chat, through an interpreter, with the chief, he promised to
supply me with carriers the next morning to take me away to the next village,
and moreover the old chief, Aruoba, would accompany me himself, and I rejoiced
over my success so far; but when evening came, the worthy chief had got lame on
one foot in some mysterious way, and of course could not accompany me, nor give
me men, he said none would undertake the journey. However, the next morning I
mustered a small party and crossed the Hilda River in order to reach a path
about a mile up the other side, where we entered, and walked under a complete
archway of tall rank grass extending for about three-quarters of a mile, when
we came to an open forest country admirably suited for stock. Here we met a
number of natives, men and women carrying fruit and vegetables in netted bags,
to be bartered with the people on the other side of the river, where they had a
proper marketplace and three or four tribes met on certain days for exchange of
goods, which arc mostly food and fruit; those who are badly off, barter
ornaments or war implements for food. On seeing me the people got greatly
excited, as I was the first European they had seen, but they soon became calm,
and most of the men conducted us to their village, Nauea, and on entering this
village the inhabitants raised their voices to the highest note in astonishment
at seeing such a party carrying articles incomprehensible to them. After a
formal introduction to the chief, and my name ascertained&mdash;it is always a
custom amongst the Papuans to ask a stranger's name, where he comes from, where
going to, and his errand amongst them&mdash;a house was placed at my disposal,
and food was brought for us all. I say the house was placed at my disposal, but
I feared every minute the frail structure would give way under its burden, for
every available space was occupied by inquisitive natives to see the wonderful
Albus man, the first one who had visited them. These people conversed at the
very top of their voices; frequently my own voice was not audible, and to amuse
myself while they were talking over all the wonderful things they saw of mine,
I commenced to whistle, and before long found myself singing an operatic song,
and the natives were as quiet as if a wonderful charm had acted upon them, with
their mouths wide open, and staring at me. I had found the secret how to subdue
their deafening conversation; I always applied the same means when I desired
quietness, and it never failed to produce effect.</p>
<p>Every day, during my stay amongst them, I was requested to sit on the
verandah of the house I occupied, and exhibit my white skin; it took place as
near as possible between 4 and 5 p.m.; at this hour the people came in from
their plantations or hunting excursions, and they appeared never to get tired
of looking at me, and feeling every part of the body, and to all this I had to
submit with a gracious smiling face.</p>
<p>The Nauea village contains about 1,500 inhabitants, with fairly good houses
and small enclosures where variegated plants grew. The people are of a small
stature, healthy and industrious, clean and orderly, well fed, and mostly of a
light colour, even as light as many half castes of a Tahitian origin, with
bright intelligent faces. Tattooing was not much practised, and the string used
by the natives at Port Moresby and in the Astrolabe ranges is dispensed with
here and replaced by a wide fibre cloth fastened like a suspender at the back,
terminating in a long pendant ribbon-like tail. The women wear a short
petticoat dyed black, and seldom more than one, but at Port Moresby, Hulu,
Kerepunu, and other places the women generally wear two or three; at every
house I saw hammocks made of bark cord, on the same principle as our European
hammocks.</p>
<p>I stayed at Nauea for several days, and explored the locality, and found it
most valuable for pastoral and agricultural purposes. It will no doubt in time
to come play an important part as a European settlement, and I have every
reason to suppose the climate is salubrious, as all the people here looked
exceptionally healthy.</p>
<p>There is one thing about the Papuan all over New Guinea that I am sorry I
cannot record favourably on, that is, their statements and promises cannot be
relied upon. When it came to the day of my departure to proceed on my journey
towards Mount Yule&mdash;from Nauea about two days' march&mdash;here also I was
refused assistance, on the ground that the Nauea people feared that the
mountain people would kill me; but on investigation I found it was nothing but
jealousy of my trade, as they did not wish it to pass into the hands of other
tribes. Notwithstanding my remonstrances, I could not induce them to take me
beyond their own district, and I with sorrow and dismay had to return to the
coast, and leave Mount Yule unexplored for the present by me.</p>
<p>The Nauea natives gave many interesting narratives relating to the people on
the other side of Mount Yule, such as the existence of a tribe with long tails.
The natives in the Astrolabe ranges have the same story about Mount Owen
Stanley; although I did not attach much importance to these wonderful tales,
what I saw and heard greatly stimulated my desire to visit Mount Yule.</p>
<p>In reference to the Hilda River, whether it will be of any practical
navigable service to future settlers is more than I can say. The natives say
the river always contains plenty of water; at the time of my visit the wet
season had already set in, and the river banks were overflowing, with a strong
current which prevented my progress; but as far as I ascended the stream, it
was not less than two chains wide, and in some places much more, and with
almost perpendicular banks. The Hilda river flows into the Ethel river near the
coast, and empties itself into the sea.</p>
<p>I am of opinion that the Hilda derives its source from the interior,
immediately at the back of Mount Yule, and as the western side of the mountain
terminates very abruptly, and apparently almost forms a perpendicular wall, I
do believe the river has its source under this wall, or within a short distance
of it. If this be correct, and the river proves navigable at all seasons of the
year, it will be a most important route for future explorers, as this route
would bring them into the centre of the south-easterly portion of the island.
And as the western side of Mount Owen Stanley range gently slopes into the
eastern side of Mount Yule, and forms a saddle between the two mountains, I
believe from this centre the Mount Owen Stanley ranges can easily be explored,
and probably from this point the summit of the mountain itself can be
reached.</p>
<p>As it appears to me that Mount Yule terminates very abruptly when it meets
the Hilda river, I have every reason to think my supposition is correct, and
from that point a vast extent of level country extends in a north-westerly
course for many miles, and will, beyond doubt, eventually be one of the
localities for European settlements.</p>
<p>In retracing my steps to the coast, I passed through several villages, and
was astonished to find a number of fowls cooped up in true European style; the
birds are merely kept for the feathers of the male, which are particularly
bright and used for ornaments; they are similar to the Malay fowls, with the
exception of being a shade bigger.</p>
<p>On my return to Maiva I again stayed there a few days, and made a small
collection of botanical specimens. The Maiva district is dry, consisting of a
series of hills, up to 600 feet above sea level, with slate and ironstone; the
vegetation is mostly a stunted eucalypti growth, and the natives are compelled
to have their plantations in the valleys where there is more moisture and
shelter for the fruit trees and vegetables. I found several quartz pebbles of a
very good quality, water-worn, which in all probability had been washed down
from the hills. The natives used large brilliant crystals as charms when
hunting or courting; these crystals were found in the Maiva district.</p>
<p>On the hills, a mile from the village, I discovered in calcareous beds a
number of marine fossils of a recent formation, I venture to think that gold
will also be discovered in the Maiva district, but in what quantity I do not
venture to predict.</p>
<p>The Maiva district has a large population with apparently abundance of food
of every description. The people are kind and friendly disposed towards
strangers, and intelligent; the men are full of conceit, and pay great
attention to their scanty attire. Many of them are handsome, and have an
aristocratic bearing. The women, who have sharp masculine features, and much
tattooed, are less pleasing than the men.</p>
<p>The marriage custom at Maiva, unlike all the places I have seen in New
Guinea, where, when a woman is married, she is deprived of all her hair and
ornaments, differs in this that she retains them at Maiva, being allowed to
keep her pretty hair. As a young girl she is tattooed all over her body, with
the exception of her face, which is left to be alone when she is married, to
indicate that the woman has entered into the matrimonial union. At the marriage
ceremony the bride and bridegroom are dressed in their best, ornamented with
feathers, shells, and bright foliage plants; friends and relatives are invited,
all giving presents, chiefly food. After the feasting is at an end, the
marriage ceremony is considered legal, and the young couple are left to
struggle for themselves. Each wife is bought from the parents, or from
relatives, should the girl's parents be dead. The payment usually consists of
pigs, food, and ornaments, tomahawks, and pearl shells, with calico, beads,
&amp;c., if any articles of European manufacture have found their way to the
villages; but the pig is on no account omitted.</p>
<p>It is of frequent occurrence that the lady leaves her husband three or four
times during life, and vice versa in each case always taking a fresh partner.
At each such mishap cocoa-nut trees and vegetable gardens belonging to the
peccant wife or husband, as the case may be, or co-respondent, are destroyed by
the injured party, a severe fight being usually the result. I saw in Maiva many
marks of the infringement of the marriage law, such as half the trunk of a
beautiful cocoa-nut palm standing as a monument of the unlawful event.</p>
<p>The only drawback to Maiva ever becoming a European Settlement is the heavy
surf on the coast, which makes it very difficult to effect a landing even with
a canoe, but I dare say when Europeans are allowed to settle in New Guinea, and
should Maiva ever become a European Settlement, civilization will devise some
means of approaching it.</p>
<h4>MOTU-MOTU, AND CUSTOMS OF THE PEOPLE</h4>
<p>Motu-Motu is situated on the eastern bank at the entrance of Williams River,
in longitude 146&deg; 9' east, and latitude 8&deg; 13' south; the district is
an immense extent of sago country, very humid, and beyond doubt the fever-bed
of New Guinea.</p>
<p>The population here I should estimate at 1,500; the people are as a rule of
tall stature, well built, and in good condition, as here is no lack of food;
considering the humidity of the district they keep in excellent health.
Smallpox has at some time or other visited this district, as unmistakable
evidences show on middle-aged men who say they had a great sickness when they
were boys, and many people died.</p>
<p>These people have many interesting customs; for instance, at a certain time
of the year, usually September and October, when vegetables are abundant,
youths are sent into the Elamos, or sacred houses, as Mr. Chalmers calls them,
but this word is a misnomer, as my readers will see further on. The youths
having reached the age of fourteen or fifteen, all the hair is shaved off their
heads. On the day of their entering the Elamo all the people feast on pigs,
yams, taros, sweet potatoes, sugarcane, cocoa-nuts, and betel-nuts, &amp;c. All
this food is collected and placed in huge heaps outside each Elamo where a boy
or several is to be imprisoned, as I call it; it is distributed amongst the
people, then cooked and consumed; singing and dancing follow. These boys remain
in the Elamo for eight or nine months, or until such time as the hair is
completely grown over the head, so that when they marry&mdash;which they are at
liberty to do when they come out&mdash;it can be tied in a mop at the back of
the head. All the time they remain in the Elamo they are allowed to communicate
with none but men, who bring them food, &amp;c. They take outdoor exercise at
night, as they must avoid all contact with women, and not even be seen by old
or young, sister or mother. When the hair is grown to the required length they
are set free; they are then considered men, and allowed to take part in matters
concerning the tribe.</p>
<p>The Elamos, it is said, are sacred houses, but I am sorry to say these
people have nothing sacred; all married and single men sleep in these so-called
sacred houses; here they gossip, eat, drink, and create mischief of every
description. If a sanctuary is used for such debasing work it cannot justly be
called a sanctuary. Death sentences have been passed upon many innocent men
from these so-called sacred houses.</p>
<p>I said married men slept in the Elamos; yes, this is rather a peculiar custom
in the matrimonial union amongst these people; every night the husband leaves
his wife and family and betakes himself to the house of mischief, there to
sleep. Not unfrequently when the husband leaves his wife in the evening, some
single man will go to the wife, give the name of her husband, and have a little
love adventure&mdash;the readers will wonder how this can be done, but it is
easy enough, as there is no light in the houses; sometimes the woman will find
out the mistake and give alarm, and the intruder will find himself in a serious
trouble, which frequently is fatal to him.</p>
<p>The images of birds, fishes, pigs, and men are kept in these houses only as
ornaments, as these people acknowledge no deities.</p>
<p>On the whole these people are very egotistic, and not easy to deal with;
they are by nature rowdy and quarrelsome, and were at one time considered the
warriors of the coast; and even at the time when Messrs. Lawes and Chalmers
took up their residence at Port Moresby, they threatened to go and fight them.
And for my own part I have not met a more selfish lot of people than the
Motu-Motuans. The Aroma and Motu-Motu people are certainly the most noisy folks
I have met in New Guinea as yet, and my wife has named them the Irish of New
Guinea. They will receive strangers very kindly, but this is policy, as they
know strangers are generally liberal with their tobacco, &amp;c.; but were the
young people taken in hand and taught what is right and wrong&mdash;for at
present they don't know what is right, except from their own point of
view&mdash;they could be made a useful people; they possess intelligence, and
are quick of comprehension. They are independent, because nature is kind to
them; they need not worry for to-morrow, and when their larder is exhausted
they need only to go into the bush, cut down a sago tree, which will supply a
family with food for weeks; cocoa-nuts they also have in abundance, and on the
whole the Papuans are the happiest people on earth, the country supplies them
with all their wants, without much exertion on their part; poor mortals in
civilization have to toil and struggle all their life long, and in most cases
only for a miserable existence. The savage is indolent, blood-thirsty, and in
every way opposed to the moral laws laid down for the guidance of humanity, yet
the Creator provides more readily for the savage in New Guinea than for the
civilized man.</p>

<hr>
<h3>REPORT.</h3>
<p>Sir Peter Scratchley arrived in Melbourne at the end of the year 1884.
Before, however, he was able to proceed to New Guinea, two main questions had
to be settled&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) To find a suitable vessel in which to go to, and remain on, the New
Guinea coast:</p>
<p>(2) To arrange with the various Australasian colonies with regard to the
present and future contributions towards the expenses of administering the
Protected Territory. In order to settle this latter question. Sir Peter
Scratchley visited the colonies of Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland,
Tasmania, and New Zealand, and personally interviewed their respective
Ministers. Ho also met and interviewed the Premier of South Australia. The
purport of the replies from these colonies with regard to this point was to the
effect that they would continue to contribute their respective quotas for
periods varying from two to five years, on the condition that a certain share
in the expenditure should be borne by the Imperial Government.</p>
<p>The difficulty and delay in obtaining a suitable vessel for service on the
New Guinea coast was intensified by the threatened rupture between England and
Russia, which was imminent during the months of March and April of that year.
Early in January, 1885, Sir Peter Scratchley had gone to Sydney, and while
there the Government had offered to place H.M.C.S. "Wolverene" at his disposal
for service on the New Guinea coast for six months. This offer was accepted,
and the vessel was placed in charge of Captain Taylor, who was instructed to
carry out the necessary refittings and repairs. In the meantime, Sir Peter went
to Tasmania, and not long after his return to Melbourne from that colony the
threatened rupture with Russia appeared so imminent that he felt it his duty to
resign the "Wolverene" and place her again at the disposal of the New South
Wales Government. For a considerable period after this his time and attention
were devoted to the defences of the various colonies. As soon as the alarm with
regard to the danger to be apprehended from Russia had somewhat subsided, he
advertised for tenders for the chartering of a steamer for service on the New
Guinea coast. Twenty answers were received, but the prices asked by the
majority of the tenderers were so exorbitant as to leave only one or two to
choose from. After considerable trouble and deliberation, Sir Peter Scratchley
accepted the tender of the Australasian Steam Navigation Company for the s.s.
"Governor Blackall," and in July she was laid up in Sydney for the purpose of
refitting and preparing for her work on the coast of New Guinea. In the
meantime, at the request of the Governments of Queensland and New Zealand, Sir
Peter Scratchley visited those colonies for the purpose of conferring with the
Ministers on the subject of his mission.</p>
<p>By the end of July, the "Governor Blackall" was ready, but, owing to his
illness. Sir Peter Scratchley was unable to start until the middle of August.
On the 13th of that month the "Governor Blackall" left Sydney, and, after
calling at Brisbane, Townsville, and Cooktown, arrived at Port Moresby on the
22nd August.</p>
<h4>PART I.&mdash;RECORD OF PROCEEDINGS.</h4>
<p>After arrival of Sir Peter Scratchley in New Guinea, his time may be divided
into three periods:&mdash;</p>
<p>(I.) From 28th August to 12th October, during which period he was engaged in
establishing the seat of Government at Port Moresby, and in inspecting the
country from Port Moresby to South Cape and Dinner Island. Redscar Bay was
visited, and an expedition made inland, for about twelve miles, to the Kabadi
district. The following places along the coast were also
visited:&mdash;Bootless Inlet, Tupuselei, Kailee, Kapakapa, Hula, Kemp, Walsh
River, Kerupunu, Kalo, Aroma, South Cape, Teste Island, and Dinner Island. From
each of these places expeditions were made inland, in some cases penetrating to
the interior to the distance of fourteen miles.</p>
<p>(II.) Period from 12th to 30th October. During this period. Sir Peter
Scratchley, in company with H.M.S. "Diamond" and "Raven" who were awaiting his
arrival at Dinner Island, was engaged in investigations concerning the killing
of white men, which had occurred among the islands on the South and South-East
Coast, in the Louisiade Archipelago, &amp;c. The following cases were
investigated:&mdash;The killing of Captain Miller, at Normanby Island, on the
3rd of that month; the killing of Reid, at Slade Island, Engineer Group; the
killing of Captain Friar, at Moresby Island; the killing of Bob Lumse, at
Hayter Island; the killing of Captain Webb, in the previous year, at Milport
Bay; the attack on the schooner "Wild Duck," in Cloudy Bay, in June, 1884. For
the purpose of obtaining evidence, the following islands were
visited:&mdash;Killerton Island and the main land in Milne Bay, Dufaure Island,
Lydia and Toulon Islands. On the 29th, the vessels returned to Aroma, where the
flag was hoisted, in the presence of about 2,000 natives; and on the 31st they
returned to Port Moresby.</p>
<p>(III.) From 1st November to 1st December&mdash;a period of exploration and
discovery. On the 1st November, the "Governor Blackall" was sent back to
Australia, in consequence of the dangerous illness of Mr. Askwith, serving on
staff, and Sir Peter Scratchley remained on shore at Port Moresby for twelve
days, making an expedition 50 miles inland to Mr. Forbes' station, at the base
of Mount Owen Stanley. After the return of the "Governor Blackall," he went to
Hula, and, on the 15th, held a Court of Inquiry on the conduct of two white
men. On the 19th, ho proceeded to Discovery Bay, in Milne Bay, exploring on the
way a hitherto unknown river on the north-east portion of the bay. On the
following day, the "Governor Blackall" was taken into hitherto unsurveyed
waters, at the head of the bay, to a place called Maivara. From here the vessel
went to Bentley Bay, the most southerly point on the North-East Coast, calling
on her way at Killerton Island, from which place an expedition was made across
the hills, extending from Milne Bay to Bentley Bay, through a country which
was reported to be teeming with hostile natives, who were, however, found to be
most friendly. From Bentley Bay the vessel cruised along the North-East Coast
to Mitre Rock, which forms the boundary of the English territory on the
North-East Coast. Mitre Rock was reached on the 25th November. From this point,
owing to the illness of Sir Peter Scratchley, the vessel steamed direct to
Australia, calling at Dinner Island and South Cape on the way, arriving at
Cooktown on the 1st December.</p>
<p>Two important results are to be noted:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) The practical knowledge gained of the country, the natives, and their
environment.</p>
<p>(2) The friendly relations opened up everywhere with the natives. With
regard to the first point, at each place visited a record was kept of the name
of the district and its chief; the approximate number of villages and
population; the native teachers resident; the character of the natives, climate
and nature of the soil; the natural products and industries, &amp;c.; and any
incidents of importance. Each of these points will be dealt with in a
subsequent part of the Report.</p>
<p>With reference to the opening up communication with the natives&mdash;at
each place, wherever possible, the chiefs were collected, presents made, and
the intention of the Government and its wish to protect black and white alike
explained. The chiefs were told that all complaints against white men were to
be made to H. M. Special Commissioner or his representative, who would
constantly patrol the coast; that no chief was to take the law into his own
hands; that tribal warfare was to be discouraged; and the absolute authority of
one chief to be recognised. The position of the native teacher, as exercising a
beneficial influence, was also everywhere recognised.</p>
<p>On arrival in New Guinea the subjects demanding immediate attention
were&mdash;(1) The appointment of officers; (2) The establishment of a seat of
Government; (3) The purchasing of land from the natives; (4) The erection of a
house for the Government Resident.</p>
<p>Captain Musgrave, Assistant Deputy Commissioner, was placed in charge and
entrusted with the administration of affairs for the district, extending from
Yule Island to Hood Bay. The Honourable J. Douglas, who was Government Resident
at Thursday Island, was also appointed Assistant Deputy Commissioner for the
purpose of exercising control over the western portion of the protected
territory. Mr. Frank Lawes was appointed Postmaster, Harbour-master, and Clerk
to Captain Musgrave. Two brothers, by name Hunter, of considerable practical
experience in New Guinea, were also taken into Government employ&mdash;the one
to act as forester and inspector of the timber trade, the other to inspect the
<i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i> industry.</p>
<p>Port Moresby was established as the seat of Government, and the sole port of
entry. The reasons for this selection were&mdash;(1) because it was the only
place where any permanent attempt at civilization had been made; (2) because of
its comparative healthiness; (3) its vicinity and easy access, especially for
sailing vessels, to Cooktown, and a telegraph station.</p>
<p>A considerable area of land, comprising the best sites in the harbour and
nearly the whole of the frontage to the sea, was, with but small difficulty,
purchased from the natives. In summoning together the claimants for this land,
and in obtaining their assent to parting with their property <i>in perpetuo</i>, and
thus securing a sound title for the Government, the assistance rendered by the
Mission was invaluable. A portion of this was set aside for Government
buildings; part was reserved as a site for a future township, and a portion was
also to be held as a native reserve.</p>
<p>Previous to the arrival of Sir Peter Scratchley at Port Moresby, the only
houses were those belonging to the Mission and to a storekeeper of the name of
Goldie. Consequently, all Government officials, and to a large extent all
visitors also, were dependent upon the hospitality of the Mission for board and
lodging. A site was, however, carefully selected by Sir Peter, on which a large
two-roomed house, which had been ordered at Townsville, was erected. This is at
present occupied by Captain Musgrave, and is the only Government residence in
the island. By means of pipes laid on from a natural spring, the house as well
as the native village below, is amply supplied with water. A prison was also in
the course of erection, and Captain Musgrave was instructed to collect
materials for the building of a native bungalow. A small printing-office was
also established, and Regulations were printed, copies of which were sent to as
many white traders as possible, and to the native teachers in each
district.</p>
<p>Boevagi, the chief of the village, was formally recognised as chief of the
district. He was instructed to refer all complaints, whether of a tribal nature
or against white men, to the Special Commissioner. Twenty-five of the
sub-chiefs of the district were summoned on board the "Governor Blackall," were
presented with presents, and were told by Sir Peter Scratchley&mdash;firstly,
that they were to regard the white man as their friend, whose presence would be
to their advantage; secondly, that they were to regard Boevagi as their chief,
to whom they were to refer to in all cases requiring arbitration.</p>
<p>In addition to the land at Port Moresby purchased by the Government, a large
tract of land, comprising nearly one half of Stacey Island, was purchased at
South Capo. In this case, the transaction was simplified by the fact that there
was only one owner, and that the rest of the tribe recognised his individual
right to dispose of the land. No title deeds were drawn up, nor did the seller
attach his name to any document; a statement was signed by the Rev. J,
Chalmers, the native interpreter, and others, to the effect that the native
(Pusa) had a solo right to the land, that he had parted with it voluntarily,
and that he and the tribe were satisfied with the payment given&mdash;about
&pound;5 worth of trade. These were the only purchases of land made.</p>
<p>Owing to the somewhat unstable and unique relationship that the Imperial and
Colonial Governments had occupied with regard to New Guinea, several Europeans
had gone through the form of purchasing land from the natives. Two classes of
claimants to land were dealt with&mdash;those who based their claims on
purchases made prior to the proclamation of the Protectorate; those who claimed
a prescriptive right to lease lands, on the ground of occupancy or original
exploration.</p>
<p>Of the first class, a claim to about 700 acres of land at Port Moresby in
1878, and a claim to 15,000 acres of land alleged to have been purchased in the
Kabadi district in 1880, were the most important. Although, under paragraph No.
6 in Commodore Erskine's Proclamation of November, 1884, these claims had no
legal basis whatever, yet as there might be special cases, where individuals
might in equity appear entitled to consideration, each case was thoroughly
investigated by Sir Peter Scratchley.</p>
<p>In the first case, the original purchase had been made in July, 1878; the
original purchaser, who had been master of a trading vessel, had died and had
assigned his claims to the present claimant, who now claimed about 500 acres of
peninsula headland, and two other allotments of about 100 acres each, these two
being comprised in the land purchased by the Government as a native reserve. In
the purchase of these it was alleged that &pound;600 had been spent. After
careful inquiry, it was made clear that certain transactions had taken place,
and that certain natives had signed their names to these transactions. It was,
however, made equally clear that, putting the trade at its highest figure, not
more than &pound;8 was given to the natives for the land.</p>
<p>The claim was refused on the following grounds:&mdash;</p>
<p>(a) Under Commodore Erskine's Proclamation it had no legal basis.</p>
<p>(b) Neither of the parties to the transaction had any legal or official
authority.</p>
<p>(c) There was no reason shown why in equity any consideration should be
given.</p>
<p>As the land in the Kabadi district was stated to be very fertile, the area
claimed extensive, and the claim already possessed an official history, a
special expedition was made for the purpose of investigation.</p>
<p>This claim was refused on the following grounds:&mdash;</p>
<p>(a) Sir Arthur Palmer's Proclamation.</p>
<p>(b) Commodore Erskine's Proclamation.</p>
<p>(c) There was no reason shown why in equity the claim should be
recognized.</p>
<p>In support of this last cause, Sir Peter Scratchley wrote: "I have
ascertained, by inquiries on the spot, that the purchase of the land was not
completed by you or your late partner, and that your negotiations for the land
have at no time been acknowledged by the chief of the district."</p>
<p>I may state that one of the partners has voluntarily retired from his
alleged claim&mdash;the other still importunes the Government on the
subject.</p>
<p>The applications for leases were based on the grounds of occupancy or
original exploration. They were all temporarily shelved or refused until the
places had been visited by Sir Peter Scratchley or one of his officers.</p>
<p>The following applications for concessions of land were recorded:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1.) From a firm in Australia, on behalf of a German Company, for the
purpose of establishing trading stations.&mdash;This application was referred to
the Imperial Government.</p>
<p>(2.) From the New Guinea Land and Emigration Company in London, to which the
following reply was returned by Sir Peter Scratchley:&mdash;"Being anxious to
assist in every way the enterprise of persons desirous of developing the
resources of the British portion of the island, I regret to state that the
project, as laid before me in your prospectus, is altogether unworkable and
premature."</p>
<p>(3.) From a New Guinea trader, in order to enable him to start a company for
the development of native industries.&mdash;The correspondence in reference to
this application was never completed.</p>
<p>Permissive occupancy of Government land, for the purpose of erecting a house
and store, was granted to two traders at Port Moresby, and also at South
Cape.</p>
<p>Permission was granted to Mr. H. O. Forbes, who has a station at Sogere,
about 50 miles inland from Port Moresby, to purchase land from the natives in
that district.</p>
<p>A registration of claimants to land or to leaseholds, on the same plan as
that adopted in Fiji, was in the course of compilation. As soon as this had
been completed, the claims of those persons who had expended money in the
purchase of land, or who had worked and cultivated land on terms of agreement
with the natives or otherwise, would have received prior consideration as
against all subsequent requests to lease or purchase.</p>
<p>In addition to the claimants already mentioned, there are others whose
claims date back for some years, who arc only waiting the result of test cases
before they take any action.</p>
<p>As it was found that no vessel would undertake the conveyance of a monthly
mail to Port Moresby at an economical rate, it was considered necessary to
abandon, for the present, the project of a monthly mail service. The Queensland
Post Office authorities agreed, however, to regard New Guinea in the same light
as an isolated station in Queensland. That is to say, letters posted in New
Guinea, and bearing a Queensland stamp, would be charged Queensland rates;
while all letters addressed to New Guinea would be forwarded to Cooktown; and
would there await the departure of any vessel that might be returning to New
Guinea, no extra charge being made for their transference from Cooktown to
their destination. The Queensland Government were also good enough to allow the
Auditor-General to make a half-yearly audit of the accounts. Official notices
with regard to New Guinea were also, by the courtesy of His Excellency the
Governor and the Premier, allowed to be inserted in the Queensland "Government
Gazette."</p>
<p>As, in Sir Peter Scratchley's opinion, the indiscriminate influx of
adventurers and speculators would be to the disadvantage of the country, no
person was allowed to go to New Guinea without a permit. Several permits to
trade were granted to private companies and individuals; but it is a
significant fact that, although the requests for these permits were very
urgent, yet in the majority of cases the applicants did not avail themselves of
them when granted. Each permit was granted subject to the observance of
conditions. The customs officer, both at Townsville and Cooktown, was
authorized by the Queensland Government to prevent any vessel without a permit
from clearing from either of the above-named ports.</p>
<p>It was a prominent item in Sir Peter Scratchley's policy to encourage as
much as possible explorations, conducted upon a proper footing and under
recognised leaders. Many persons applied for permits to explore who were
totally unfit to do so, and whose attempt, had permits been granted them, would
have been ruin to themselves, and would have made a breach in the relations
with the natives which it might have taken years to heal. The following remarks
on this question appear in his note book:&mdash;"All explorations must be
methodical and systematic. No time must be fixed for the return of the
exploring party, which should be composed of as few members as possible. No
exploring party should act independently of the Government."</p>
<p>The two most important explorations undertaken during Sir Peter Scratchley's
administration were&mdash;</p>
<p>(1.) The expedition of the Australasian Geographical Society, under Captain
Everill. The whole history of this expedition is so well known that remark is
unnecessary.</p>
<p>(2.) Mr. H. O. Forbes, Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, arrived in
Australia in August, and accompanied Sir Peter Scratchley in the s.s. "Governor
Blackall" to New Guinea. His object is to explore the Owen Stanley Range. For
this purpose he has established himself, with 25 Malays, at a station at the
base of the mountain, and has opened up friendly relations not only with the
natives immediately around him, but also far back into the interior. Early in
the dry season he will attempt the ascent of the mountain. In the meantime, he
is engaged in making observations and collecting Botanical and Natural History
specimens. He will eventually furnish the Government with a Geological Report
upon the country through which he passes. In order to assist him in his
operations. Sir Peter Scratchley has authorized him to purchase land from the
natives, for the purpose of introducing the cultivation of rice and maize, and
a considerable amount of the former, for seed purposes, was ordered from
Batavia. Sir Peter also furnished him with a large number of seeds for the
purpose of forming a Government garden. It had also been the intention of Sir
Peter Scratchley to have granted him from the Government funds a considerable
sum of money to enable him to continue his operations after his ascent of the
mountain. His long experience in dealing with natives, the accurate records
kept by him of the natural features and natural products of the country, render
his work as an explorer of exceptional value in adding to the knowledge of the
country.</p>
<p>(3.) An application was made from the Mayor of Townsville for a permit to be
granted to a gold prospecting expedition to visit the country. This was
granted, and Sir Peter Scratchley promised to instruct his officers to assist
the expedition in every way possible. It was, however, pointed out that it
would not be advisable for the expedition to start until the end of the rainy
reason.</p>
<p>During his cruise along the coast, many instances of strained relationships
existing between the trading whites and the natives were brought under Sir
Peter Scratchley's notice.</p>
<p>The most important complaint made by natives against white men was a</p>
<p>charge brought by Renaki, chief of Hula, against two white men, by name
Guise and Currie. These two men had been resident in that district for some
time, and the chief had made a complaint to Mr. Romilly about them in December,
1884. He complained that, although they were resident in the district, they
followed no trade; that they were in the habit of systematically violating the
young women of the tribe; and, what appeared to be the chief cause of his
complaint, of violating the married women also. He further informed Mr. Romilly
that they had spoken disrespectfully of the Commodore. Acting upon this
complaint, Mr. Romilly requested the captain of H.M.S. "Swinger" to deport the
men from Hula. This was done, and they were taken in that vessel to Australia.
They, however, again returned in a vessel which had no permit, and took up
their residence at Hula. On Sir Peter Scratchley's first visit to Hula, in
September, the chief Renaki made a formal complaint against these two men, and
asked Sir Peter Scratchley if he was strong enough to remove them. At that time
Sir Peter Scratchley was unable to remain at the village, but he promised that
he would return and investigate the matter. Accordingly, when he visited Hula
in November, a Court was held on board the s.s. "Governor Blackall," and the
two men, Guise and Currie, were summoned by warrant to appear. The native
evidence taken before the Court was not strong enough to justify their
deportation under clause 26 of the Western Pacific Orders in Council, but they
were proceeded against under clause 27 of those Orders, which prohibits
residents in the Island from remaining there if their presence shall be
considered by the Commissioner detrimental to the peace and good order of the
Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>A few minor complaints, made against some of the traders on the coast, with
reference to the prices paid for <i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i>, &amp;c., were also
adjudicated upon.</p>
<p>The principal complaint of whites against natives was a charge of robbery
with assault, committed by some of the natives at Aroma, upon a trader called
Dan Rowan. This case was carefully investigated on the spot by Sir Peter
Scratchley, and the native evidence taken in the matter, the result being that
the chief was ordered to restore the stolen property, which was done.</p>
<p>Six cases of white men who had been killed during the past two years on the
New Guinea Coast were investigated. The results of these investigations went to
show&mdash;</p>
<p>(1.) That the white men killed fell into two classes:&mdash;(a) Those who
were killed for their individual crimes against native laws, either immorality,
as in the case of Reid, or of unfair and unjust dealing, as in the case of Bob
Lurase, or, as in the case of Webb, for recklessly ignoring of tribal feuds and
warfare, (l) Those who fell as victims to native superstitious ideas, and the
demand for vengeance which the evils of the labour traffic had aroused, vide
Frier and Miller's case.</p>
<p>(2.) That in every case, therefore, there was either direct or indirect
aggressive provocation on the part of the whites against the blacks.</p>
<p>(3.) That, in the majority of cases, there was reckless disregard on the
part of the murdered of warnings given. Frier refused to believe the native boy
who told him the natives had determined to kill him. Miller had been warned by
Captain Bridge of H.M.S. "Espiegle," and by Mr. Chalmers, not to go to Normanby
Island.</p>
<p>So many and so various are the difficulties connected with the question of
punishment, that to administer justice according to European notions for these
outrages is impossible. A murder is committed, and a man-of-war proceeds to the
spot. She finds that every person in the village has left, taking everything
with them; by waiting a day or so, some of the men will return. They will not,
however, fight&mdash;at the first sign of hostility they flee into the jungle,
where to pursue them would be fatal, as for every native caught, ten white men
might be speared. Should, however, the natives remain and consent to give
evidence, such evidence is wholly unreliable, partly from the difficulty of
interpretation and explanation, and partly also from the readiness with which,
when they do understand, they will endeavour to adapt their statements to the
leading idea or apparent wish of the questioner. Then, again, the native custom
with regard to payment for murder, and their low estimate of human life, forms
another difficulty. In the case of Miller, one of the murderers came off to the
ship voluntarily, bringing his payment or <i>wergild</i> for the murder he had
committed. He was detained on board, but to have punished him with death, in
the face of his having voluntarily paid what, according to his standard of
justice, was a full penalty for his deed, would have been revenge and not
justice.</p>
<p>As a result of the experience gained by Sir Peter Scratchley during these
investigations, the following conclusions wore arrived at:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1.) That the Government cannot be responsible for the protection of
irresponsible traders, who cruise from place to place in vessels insufficiently
manned, whose defenceless position, and the possession of trade which they
injudiciously expose, are almost invariably a source of incitement to the
natives to attack them.</p>
<p>(2.) That men-of-war vessels are not suited for the purpose of administering
justice and punishing outrages on the New Guinea coast; that under the peculiar
conditions for which they are required, they combine the least amount of
efficiency with the greatest display of force.</p>
<p>(3.) That the most effective police would be a selected crew of Samoans or
Fijians, under the charge of an English officer, who would be constantly
patrolling the coast. This force could also be utilized for the prevention of
tribal warfare. It would of course be necessary that the officer in charge
should send in a written report of his proceedings.</p>
<h4>PART II.&mdash;THE EXISTING STATE OP THE COUNTRY.</h4>
<p>The above-mentioned administrative proceedings were more or less of a
provisional nature, and were incidental to what appeared to Sir Peter
Scratchley to be the main object of his cruise, namely, to gain a practical
insight into the actual condition of the country, in order to be able to lay
before the Imperial and Colonial Governments some scheme for its
administration. As it is evident, on account of the climate, that as the
natural resources of New Guinea can only be developed by means of coloured
labour, the distribution of the natives, both as to population and disposition,
is perhaps of paramount importance. With the exception of some portions of the
North-East Coast, almost the entire littoral of the Protected Territory is
inhabited. In the West and North-West, from the Fly River to Hall Sound, the
natives are very numerous, the tribes are large, and a higher stage of tribal
development is reached than elsewhere. The soil is in some places extremely
fertile, and the sago produced in this portion of the coast supplies the
districts on the South-West Coast as far as Kaile.</p>
<p>The natives inhabiting not only the coast, but also the high lands and
valleys from Port Moresby to Kerupunu, are numerous, peaceable, and show
themselves willing to adopt European ideas with regard to labour, &amp;c. This
is especially the case among the fertile lands behind Kapakapa, Hula, and
Kerupunu. At Aroma, Cloudy Bay, Milport Bay, and Toulon Island, the character
of the natives changes; they are very numerous, their tribal organization is
more complete, and their individual physique finer, but they are not to be
trusted&mdash;their latent capacity for bloodshed is strong, and with
difficulty restrained.</p>
<p>The population from South Cape to Bentley Bay and East Cape is more
scattered, the villages are small and numerous, the people small in stature,
and of peaceable disposition.</p>
<p>But little is known of the natives on the north-east coast; the few that
were visited were visited during the cruise of the "Governor Blackall." Several
places were visited where no white man had ever been before; although shy, the
natives appeared to be friendly; in some places the villages were very
large.</p>
<p>Most of the islands in the Louisiade Archipelago and D'Entrecasteaux Group
are thickly populated; the natives are, however, treacherous, and less to be
trusted than those on the mainland; in most of the islands also, as well as on
the mainland from South Cape to Bentley Bay, the natives have been and are
cannibals.</p>
<p>From what is known of the interior, the villages appear to be numerous, and
the people friendly. At Mr. Forbes' station, the furthest settlement inward
hitherto attempted, the natives are not only friendly, but have caused tribes
living far away in the interior to become friendly also.</p>
<p>During his tours of inspection. Sir Peter Scratchley personally visited no
fewer than 18 districts, 27 islands, 51 inland villages, and nearly 60 coast
villages. Except on rare occasions, no arms were carried; and on no single
occasion was the slightest hostility shown, or was there a single disturbance
with the natives.</p>
<p>The social and political organization of the New Guinea natives is quite
rudimentary. Even the tribes in the West, who are less barbarous than
elsewhere, have no fully developed tribal system, such as existed in Fiji,
Java, or New Zealand. On the other hand, however, nowhere arc they nomadic or
so low in the scale as the Australian black.</p>
<p>The infinite variety of dialects to be found throughout the Protected
Territory is a prominent element of difficulty in dealing with the natives,
whether for trading or investigation purposes. Not only each district, but each
village, has very frequently a different dialect. The Motu dialect prevails
over the largest area, namely, from Port Moresby to Kapa Kapa.</p>
<p>Owing not improbably to the influence of the ISIalay element they have
everywhere shown themselves ready to trade with Europeans, and eagerly
exchange, not only natural products, pigs, Sec, but even personal ornaments,
relics, house utensils, Sec, for tobacco, axes, cloth, Sec. They have also a
good deal of inland trading among themselves, the inland supplying the coast
tribes with food products in exchange for fish, salt, &amp;c. In the Port
Moresby district large expeditions are annually made to the Gulf of Papua for
the purpose of exchanging the pottery (burnt clay pots) made at Port Moresby
for the sago grown in the West. These expeditions arc undertaken in large
crafts (Lakatois) made by lashing several canoes together. In those they
frequently go out of sight of land, and steer by the stars. It was estimated
that in one of these expeditions, which started from Port Moresby shortly after
the arrival of the "Governor Blackall," 20,000 pots were taken, for which they
would bring back in exchange about 150 tons of sago.</p>
<p>As the natives exist almost entirely upon vegetable diet&mdash;yams,
bananas, &amp;c.&mdash;they are obliged to undergo a certain amount of labour
in tilling the ground. This, however, is done mainly by the women, who are not
unfrequently skilful agriculturalists. The men, however, as a rule, are not
industrious, and seem incapable of any systematic permanent labour. The
principal food sources are bananas, yams, sweet potatoes, tare, coca-nuts,
sugar-cane, bread-fruit, and other native fruits, fish, &amp;c.</p>
<p>In order to render the natives more capable of self-government among
themselves and useful instruments in developing the resources of the country,
it will be necessary that native customs and institutions should be reformed by
Government in two directions.</p>
<p>(1.) It will be necessary to create in each district a tribal chief, who
will also be a British official. This chief will be trustee for the lands, and
responsible for the conduct of the inhabitants in its district.</p>
<p>At present, not only in each district but in each village, there appears to
be a chaos of authorities. Under the present circumstances, each man, beyond
conforming to certain established customs, is a law to himself. In a single
village there is not unfrequently to be found three rival chiefs, each basing
his claim to chieftainship upon a different basis; there is the patriarchal
chief, who is, more or less, connected by kin with all in the village; there is
the man who is chief by virtue of his individual prowess in war; and there is
also, perhaps, a sorcerer chief. It occasionally happened that all three
attributes, or perhaps two, were centred in one chief&mdash;as, for instance,
Koapena, chief of Aroma&mdash;but this is the exception, and not the rule. The
remedy suggested by Sir Peter Scratchley was to introduce a modified form of
the Java system, crushing out the minor chiefs, and making the
Government-elected chief the recipient of a certain annual payment. He would
then be held responsible for the safety of all foreigners, and for the
maintenance of law and order within his district.</p>
<p>(2.) It will be necessary to raise the standard of native comfort, by
introducing the cultivation of rice and maize.</p>
<p>This could be done by means of the official chief and native teachers. Its
effect would be to increase the number of requirements among the
natives&mdash;to give them an inducement to steady labour and systematic
cultivation. Hitherto tobacco has been current coin among the natives, and only
so long as they were in want of this would they work, consequently their labour
could never be depended upon. At Port Moresby, however, and elsewhere, the
introduction of a meal of rice, as payment for a day's work, was appreciated,
and proved a far greater incentive to steady and reliable labour than
tobacco.</p>
<p>The system of land tenure in New Guinea is generally admitted to be a
complicated one. Those who have hitherto written and reported concerning it
have almost without exception regarded it as an organized system of tribal
ownership; but although the natural boundaries of the tribal district are
always known to each member of the community, yet it seems probable that there
is no idea of tribal ownership as it is generally understood.</p>
<p>The actual ownership of the land appears to be based upon the basis of
kinship. The land is divided into divisions and subdivisions, owned by groups
of individuals, who are all more or less connected by kin. The number of
individuals in these groups is variable. The group may have dwindled down to
one representative, or it may have indefinitely increased. Each member of this
family group regards himself as having a distinct interest in the land
appropriated to his kinsmen; not only, however, can no one member alienate the
land without the consent of the family group, but each member lays claim to
receive a share of the profits of the sale of such land. The sense of
individual proprietorship is very strong, and extends to particular trees, and
even to the fruit upon these trees, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The position and action of the chiefs will vary in proportion to their
individual influence and power. If the land to be disposed of belong to the
family group, of which the district chief is also the patriarchal head, he
would be the most prominent figure in any transactions with the land; but if
the land in question belong to a different family group from that to which he
himself belongs, and he has no voice by virtue of kinship with them, then his
authority and power as district chief will, with reference to this land, be
almost nothing. It is exceptional to find a chief strong enough to negotiate
independently for the disposal of the land belonging oven to his own group.
It is, therefore, still less common to find him negotiating with regard to land
in which, from want of relationship to the owners, he has not himself any
share. However vague these distinctions with regard to the interests of chiefs
and of members of family groups in land may appear to Europeans, they
nevertheless seem to be pretty well defined and understood by the natives
themselves. As a practical illustration of the strange degrees in which various
members and chiefs of tribes are interested in the tribal lauds, I may give the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>There was a small piece of land at Port Moresby for which thirty or forty
members of a tribe alone claimed payment. These, however, were not the whole of
the tribe but only a part, and their apparent right to receive the money was
acquiesced in by the rest of the tribe. At South Cape, however, the independent
right of one individual, and he was not a chief, to dispose of a large area of
land was recognized by the whole tribe&mdash;no one, not even the chief of that
tribe, putting forward any claim for payment; while again, for the land
adjoining, there were many owners out of the tribe, each of whom, including the
chief, would have had to receive payment in settlement for any land sold. At
Kabadi, a piece of land belonged to a family group, of which the district chief
was not the patriarchal head, and he was consequently, on the sale of the land,
only able to veto the transaction, but could not stop the transactions in
connection with the sale of the land.</p>
<p>Although it is probable that the confidence of the natives would best be
gained by avoiding for the present any attempt to purchase land, yet this
course is now hardly practicable. It is, however, evident that with all these
different and conflicting interests in any one piece of land, it is absolutely
necessary that there should be one recognized source and channel from which a
good title could be drawn, otherwise it might be that two or three members of
one of the groups might pretend to have authority to sell land to any
purchaser, but in reality they would have only a small interest in the
purchase-money, each of the other members of the group having an equal right to
their share in it. The conditions for bringing about a war in connection with
land, similar to that which occurred in New Zealand, are abundantly present in
New Guinea, and unless the land transactions are controlled by Government,
complications with the natives must arise. It is not easy, however, to define
in what most practical and economical manner this control could be exercised.
One means towards this end would be the creation of an official tribal chief,
through whom theoretically the title would issue. No title would be valid
without his assent, but this assent must be certified to by the
Sub-Commissioner in charge of the district, and, if necessary, receive the
approval of the Special Commissioner. Transactions for land, however, under a
certain defined area, might, under special conditions, be made directly with
the natives. Other means might also be devised on the spot for ensuring a good
title to lands.</p>
<p>The London Mission Society commenced to work in New Guinea in 1871. In its
constitution and principles it is unsectarian, but for many years it has been
mainly supported by the Congregational Churches of the British Isles and
Australian Colonies. The Mission districts are as follows:&mdash;(a) The
Western begins at the Baxter River, embraces the Fly and the Katan Rivers, and
ends at the Aird River. This is under the care of the Rev. S. McFarland and the
Rev. &mdash; Scott. The head-quarters of this district are not situated on the
main land but at Murray Island, where natives are instructed and sent to the
coast to open Mission stations. In the institution many industrial arts are
taught, and a schooner for Mission purposes has been recently launched which
was built by the students under the direction of an English boat-builder. (b)
The Central District begins at the Aird River and ends at Orangery Bay, having
Port Moresby for its head-quarters, and the Rev. W. G. Lawes, F.R.G.S., and the
Rev. J. Chalmers are at the head of this district. (c) The remaining district
extends from Orangery Bay eastward, and is under the care of the Revds. &mdash;
Savage and W. Sharpe.[*] At Port Moresby is a college and school, whereat
native teachers are trained for the purpose of carrying out Mission work.</p>
<blockquote>[* Since writing this the Rev. W. Sharpe has died from fever in New
Guinea.]</blockquote>
<p>There are thirty South Sea Island and ten New Guinea teachers, located at as
many stations. These stations form a chain from East Cape to Maclatchie Point,
and then again on the Fly River, and to the west of it. Although the whole of
that coast line is not actually occupied, the gaps are being rapidly filled up.
Between the two places mentioned above, there is only one gap, namely, Cloudy
Bay, where the natives are not on friendly terms with the teachers. At each
station the Mission teacher has a large house and a garden, also a whale boat;
at the majority of stations there is also a church built. It would be
impossible to define the area over which the influence both of Mr. Chalmers and
Mr. Lawes as well as of the native teachers extends. One positive result of the
labours of the Mission is that they have succeeded, not merely in opening up
communication with the natives along nearly the entire littoral of the
Protected Territory, and far into the interior as well, but, what is more
important, they have inspired those natives with confidence. Had the result
been reversed, and the natives rendered aggressively hostile or suspicious,
none but armed bodies of men could have ventured into the interior, nor could
single individuals have cruised from point to point along the coast in fair
security. Under the present conditions, a single white man, unarmed, can go
fifty miles into the interior from any point between Port Moresby and Hula in
perfect safety.</p>
<p>The successful results attained by the Mission in this respect are due,
partly, to the special qualifications for the work possessed by the Revs. W. G.
Lawes and J. Chalmers. The former has acquired a scholarly mastery of the
native language, has compiled a grammar and dictionary from an unknown
language, and has organized a body of interpreters. To his efforts are due the
possibility of being able to carry out investigations and enter into
explanations with the natives. The latter, by his energy and
enthusiasm&mdash;by his courage and tact&mdash;has not only overcome native
shyness and distrust, but wherever ho has gone ho has upheld the moral
superiority of the white man, and inspired even the wildest barbarians with
trust and confidence.</p>
<p>Success is also partly due to the native teachers, who frequently, with
their lives in their hands, have been pioneers to break down native
superstition and distrust. They are the channels of communication between
European ideas and native superstitions, and their usefulness from a political
point of view is very considerable. To their devotedness and zeal is due the
fact that Europeans are able to go with tolerable security into places which
otherwise must have remained sealed to any but armed forces. By their means,
moreover, the natives might be induced to undertake the cultivation of rice,
maize, &amp;c. They are excellent gardeners themselves, and have cultivated
limes, Papua apples, pine-apples, oranges, tea, potatoes, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Experience shows, that the presence among primitive barbarians of
Missionaries of different sects is not infrequently the cause of political
disturbances, or even civil war. This was especially the case in some of the
islands in the Western Pacific, Rotumah, &amp;c. The efforts of the Roman
Catholic Mission to establish themselves in places which the London Mission
Society had occupied for years, were, in Sir Peter Scratchley's opinion, upon
political grounds, to be discouraged. He considered that the London Mission
had, in equity, a prescriptive right within certain districts, and that the
intrusion within these districts of a rival denominational sect was likely to
produce trouble among the natives. Hearing, therefore, that certain Roman
Catholic priests had established themselves at Yule Island, which had been
previously occupied by the London Mission, he wrote to the head of the Roman
Catholic Mission at Thursday Island, and pointed out the settlement on Yule
Island of these priests was undesirable, and that other areas were available
for their efforts. He further offered to take the priests in the s.s.
"Governor Blackall" to the Louisiade group, or any other island they might
desire.</p>
<p>There are, in all, about twenty white men now resident in New Guinea. The
majority of these are traders, who are backed in a small way by merchants and
firms in Australia. There are three stores at Port Moresby, and one settler has
erected a sawmill. The traders, as a rule, live in their boats, but a few
native houses at Hula and Killerton Island have been erected by Europeans. In
consequence of the recent murders that have been committed in the islands, and
the disturbed state of the natives generally on the South-East Coast, warnings
were sent round to as many traders as possible.</p>
<p>The climate of New Guinea must doubtless be considered as one of its
greatest drawbacks. In the first place, it is enervating, and Europeans are
incapable during the summer of performing much continuous labour; and,
secondly, the fever, which is everywhere prevalent, is of a severe character.
Although all early attempts at permanent settlement, especially on the coast,
must be attended with a high rate of mortality, yet it seems not improbable
that there the New Guinea climate will resemble that of the north of
Queensland, and that in proportion as settlement advances and the soil is
worked, so the pestilential character of the climate will become modified. In
breaking up land for sugar plantations in the north of Queensland, every one,
Kanakas as well as Europeans, were attacked, some fatally, with fever. On the
same stations fever is now almost unknown. With regard, however, to the present
state of the climate in New Guinea, all that can be done is to point out some
of the least unhealthy spots on the coast, such as Cornwallis Island, Port
Moresby, Dinner Island, Killerton Island, Teste Island, and several places on
the North-East Coast. In the interior, although fever prevails, it is not of so
severe a character as that on the coast, while the atmosphere, especially on
the highlands, is more bracing and invigorating.</p>
<p>The commencement of the seasons in New Guinea are:&mdash;Spring, September
23rd; Summer, December 21st; Autumn, March 20th; Winter, June 21st. The rainy
season commences in December, and lasts with more or less fall of weather until
April. The rough statistics collected with regard to the rainfall shows as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>On the North-West Coast, as far as to Redscar Bay, rainfall moderate
throughout the year; excessive during rainy season. Most healthy portion of the
year from June to October. On the South-East Coast, from Port Moresby to
Kerupunu, rainfall almost nil for sometimes six months in the year; during this
season this district, especially Port Moresby, is, comparatively speaking,
healthy. From Aroma to East Cape the rainfall in the summer is considerable. At
South Cape the least unhealthy season is during the north-east monsoon or rainy
season. On the southern portion of the North-East Coast the rainfall is
apparently small. Among the islands the rainfall throughout the year is
considerable, and the most unhealthy portion of the year throughout the
Protected Territory is in April and May, as the floods are subsiding after the
rainy season.</p>
<p>The whole of the Papuan Gulf may be regarded as unsafe for vessels to visit.
The water is always muddy, and reefs cannot be seen. Moreover, there is little
depth of water for miles from the shore, very often not more than two fathoms,
and heavy rollers are constantly coming in. From Redscar Head eastwards the
South Coast is skirted almost continuously by a reef, an outlier of the great
Australian Barrier Reef. This reef extends from the shore, at a distance of
some five to six miles, and the numerous indentations afford excellent harbours
and anchorage. Along the whole of the North-East Coast, from East Cape to Mitre
Rock, are numerous large harbours. The most important harbours, however, which
would afford anchorage to any considerable number of vessels of a large size
are Port Moresby, Orangerie Bay, Milport Bay, and South Cape. At some of these,
however, landing for small boats is difficult, on account of the fringe of
reef. The navigation along the whole coast is difficult, and no vessel can
travel at night.</p>
<p>There are a large number of rivers in the Protected Territory, and the whole
of it, with the exception of the district around Port Moresby, appears to be
well watered. The largest rivers are those which drain the basin of the vast
level region which begins on the west side of the Gulf of Papua. The largest of
these rivers is the Fly River, which rises some hundreds of miles in the
interior. It is supposed that many of the smaller rivers are mere branches
leading into the Fly. Owing to the action of the south-west monsoon, which
blows during the healthy season, the mouths of these rivers are silted up with
sand and mud, and are unnavigable. This is especially the case in the Aird
River, which it is only possible to enter during the north-east monsoon, or
unhealthy season. On the South-East Coast the rivers are numerous, and the
soils on the banks fertile. As, however, the elevated land is near the coast,
they are small in comparison with those in the west. The North-East Coast
appeared to be well watered, and several rivers of considerable size were seen.
In Dyke Acland Bay, where there is a vast tract of level country, densely
wooded, intervening between the coast and the highlands, which are very
distant, the mouth of a very large river was discerned. This river was not
marked on any map.</p>
<p>In Milne Bay, two rivers, not mentioned in any map and apparently unknown,
were discovered and explored. The first river (native name Davadava) was
discovered in the north-east of the Bay, and was explored for a distance of
about six miles. The banks were steep and precipitous; vegetation rank; timber;
depth from eight to twelve feet; small bar at its mouth, navigable for a small
steamer. It is comparatively a small river, rising in the mountains near the
coast. The other river (native name Hadara) was a very large one, and
apparently led into the heart of the country. There were several deltas at the
mouth. The land on either side was flat and the soil very rich; vegetation very
tropical and in abundance; depth of river from twelve to sixteen feet. Large
numbers of natives were seen; they were, however, very friendly.</p>
<p>Within a radius of 100 miles from Port Moresby, the wallaby is to be found
in large numbers. The undulating plains which extend at the back of Port
Moresby are great hunting grounds for wallaby and pigs. Outside this radius the
wallaby is not found. Wild pigs are found everywhere in the Protected
Territory. The cuscus, an animal resembling the Australian native bear, and a
species of tree kangaroo are to be found in the southern portion of the
Peninsula. These animals, together with the wallaby, are marsupials. It is
supposed that monkeys exist in the interior in the west. Birds of all
sorts&mdash;pigeons, duck, cassowary, birds of paradise, &amp;c.,&mdash;are
very numerous.</p>
<p>The mineral resources of the Protected Territory, both as to kind and
quantity, are still a matter of conjecture. With regard to gold, two specimens
of sand, one from the Larogi and the other from Milne Bay, have been assayed.
The assay of the specimen from the Larogi River yield gold, but not in payable
quantities; the results of the assay of that taken from Milne are not yet
known. It is the opinion of Mr. H. O. Forbes, based upon his geological
observations, that gold will not be found to the westward, but might lie among
the high country in the Milne Bay district, and on the North-East Coast.
Plumbago has been seen at various places along the South-West Coast. Pebbles
and small fragments brought down from the interior, consisting of mica slate,
quartz, sandstones, greenstone, and jasperiod rocks, show the formations there
to be undistinguishable from the Silurian and Devonian series of the goldfields
of New South Wales. Rocks of similar ago, with granite and gneiss, were also
found.</p>
<p>The following industries are at the present time in operation in the
country, from which a revenue could be immediately obtained:&mdash;Timber,
<i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i>, copra-making, pearl fishing, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The glowing accounts which have appeared in the newspapers of the prospects
of the timber trade in New Guinea have raised expectations of a very sanguine
nature. It is true that there are large quantities of cedar and malava (species
of cedar) on the banks of the rivers in the west, in the Manu-manu district,
and on the Kemp, Walsh, Edith, and other rivers; but it is not generally known
that a very large proportion of this timber is so small as not to be of
marketable value. As large quantities of cedar had been felled before the
proclamation of the Protectorate by firms in Australia, permits were granted
to remove this timber, but the felling of fresh timber was prohibited until the
spot had been visited by Sir Peter Scratchley or one of his officers. The
wisdom of this step was shown by the fact that large numbers of young cedar
trees, too small for use, had been cut down in sheer wanton waste. To prevent
this for the future, a Forester was appointed, whose duty it was to prohibit
the felling of timber below a certain girth. It was stated, verbally, by an
agent for an Australian company who had for some years past been engaged in
felling timber in New Guinea, that out of 10,000,000 superficial feet of cedar
and malava fallen, only about 500,000 superficial feet were of marketable
value. He further went on to state that he did not think the future prospects
of the cedar trade were hopeful, and that he himself would hardly be able to
recover the money he had already spent in felling and removing timber. Besides
the cedar and malava, there are, however, large quantities of india-rubber
trees, massoi, sandalwood, ebony, hardwood, tamonu, &amp;c.,&mdash;especially
in the district around South Cape, ebony grows in considerable quantities. Two
or three large firms have invested capital in this trade in New Guinea. By one
firm a number of Kanakas were employed, but hitherto no complications have
arisen with the natives with regard to this industry.</p>
<p><i>B&ecirc;che-de-mer</i>, or the sea-slug, which is an article <i>de luxe</i>
among the Chinese, is to be found all along the coast from Port Moresby to
Aroma, including Constance Island, Milport Bay, Milne Bay, Slade Island,
Bentley Bay, and, it is believed, in some bays on the north-east coast. The
number to be obtained, however, especially on the south-west coast, has
materially decreased during the last few years. The profits are small and
precarious, and a considerable amount of hardship has to be undergone in
prosecuting the trade. There is also a further difficulty in some districts
where the natives, through superstition, dislike handling the <i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i>. It
was estimated that the actual annual export in this industry amounted to about
&pound;8,000; and it was suggested that the revenue raised by a tax on this
trade might eventually be considerable. The expense, however, of collecting
this tax would absorb a large portion of the amount raised. It was the
intention of Sir Peter Scratchley to establish a depot for this industry at
Teste Island. An inspector was appointed, whose duty it was to report the
number of vessels engaged, and the number of tons of fish exported. According
to his estimate, there are now ten schooners occupied with this work, and the
estimated amount of fish exported is about 500 tons. The persons engaged in
this pursuit are, generally speaking, small irresponsible traders, who are
constantly coming into collision with the natives with regard to payments,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>Copra is made by splitting open cocoa-nuts and drying them either
artificially or in the sun. It is used in large quantities in Europe as an
element in oil cake and other cattle foods. The localities at present suited
for the manufacture of copra are on the south-west coast from Hula to Roma, all
along the shores of Milne Bay, at Bentley Bay, and along the north-east coast
as far as Dumpier Straits, and many of the Islands of the D'Entrecasteaux and
Louisiade Group. At each of these places cocoa-nuts grow in abundance, and
could be purchased from the natives at a low price. It would, moreover, be very
easy to induce them to plant more cocoa-nut trees, which, if planted in a
certain manner, would bear fruit in three years. Thus, this industry is likely
to yield a considerable profit to the individuals engaged in it. In order,
however, to facilitate its development, it would be necessary to have a chain
of stations at various points, whereby a constant supply of nuts could be
obtained. The natives show themselves willing to work in procuring the nuts,
and are often found trustworthy agents, and capable of rendering a correct
account of any trade left in their hands for the purpose of purchase. In
consequence of the moisture of the climate at Milne Bay and surrounding
islands, there would be considerable difficulty in drying the nuts in the sun.
As sun-dried copra is superior to the smoke-dried copra, it has been suggested
that it would be more profitable to bring the nuts to Port Moresby, to be dried
there by the sun, rather than treat them by artificial means.</p>
<p>The seat of the pearl fishing industry has hitherto been on the western
extremity of the Territory, and occasionally large amounts of pearl have been
collected. Quite recently, however, a large find of pearl was made in the
Louisiade Group, and it is not improbable that this industry may assume much
larger proportions, especially among the islands on the East Coast.</p>
<p>On the well-watered valleys of the Astrolabe ranges, and on the fertile
areas distributed all over the Protected Territory, the following articles, for
which a market could be found in the Australian colonies, could be produced
without competing with colonial industries:&mdash;Cinchona, coffee, rice, on
the hills, as in Java and Timor-Laut; and on the swamps, on the north-east
coast, sugar, arrowroot, cotton (which grow wild), vanilla, tobacco, &amp;c. In
course of time, the natives themselves might be taught to cultivate these, and
would return the produce to the Government, a certain portion being reserved as
their contribution towards the expenses of Government, and the surplus being
made over to them as wages.</p>
<p>The following are some of the natural articles of commerce already growing
in the country, and capable of forming sources of revenue in addition to the
industries mentioned above:&mdash;Nutmegs, ginger, pepper, india-rubber trees
(those grow to a large size in the Tabouri district), spices of all kinds,
sago, hemp, tnassoi bark (largely used for medicinal purposes), cocoa-nut
fibre, sandalwood, saffron canes, rattan.</p>
<p>In some portions of the interior it would be possible to graze sheep and
cattle&mdash;these might supply a local market&mdash;but the obstacles in the
way of developing purely agricultural interests in the country, on account of
the difficulties of communication, would be very great.</p>
<p>A central range of mountains running north and south forms the backbone of
the Protected Territory. The highest point in this range is supposed to be
Mount Owen Stanley, 13,200 feet. Leading to the base of this central range on
either side, east and west, are a series of high ranges or spurs, whose sides
are covered with dense tropical forest of a virgin growth. Interspersed among
these ranges are open valleys, full of rich deep soil, table lands, patches of
open country covered with coarse grass, and craters evidently formed by recent
volcanic action. Many of the hillsides and valleys had been cleared, fenced,
and cultivated by the natives. In some cases the ranges come almost sheer to
the coast; in others, as at Kabadi, &amp;c., the intervening land between the
ranges and the coast is perfectly flat and open; while, again, at other places
such as Kapakapa, Hula, &amp;c., miles of gently undulating country, well
watered, with patches of forest intervening, stretch far back into the interior
from the coast. The character of the vegetation, especially on the coast, and
in many cases of the soil also, is entirely Australian; towards the interior,
however, it becomes more tropical, both as regards its character and
density.</p>
<h4>PART III.&mdash;FUTURE ADMINISTRATION, EXPENDITURE, ETC.</h4>
<p>Before any definite programme of administration for the Protected Territory
can be laid down, two questions of considerable political importance must first
be settled. In the first place, the status and authority of the Special
Commissioner watching the Protected Territory requires to be more clearly and
definitely defined, and secondly, the present political relationship of the
Imperial Officer administering the country with respect to the Imperial and
Colonial Governments is a wholly anomalous one, and one which apparently will
not prove workable. Under the present arrangement. New Guinea forms no integral
part in the Anglo-Australian System.</p>
<p>With reference to the first point, namely, the authority and status of the
Special Commissioner, the following is the conclusion of a legal opinion
obtained from the Hon. Mr. Griffith, Q.C., Queensland, given as Q.C. and not as
Premier:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I am therefore of opinion that General Scratchley has at present no legal
jurisdiction and authority of any kind, except such as he can exercise as a
Deputy Commissioner for the Western Pacific; and in particular that he has no
power to make any regulations having the force of law, or to impose or collect
any taxes or license fees upon exports or imports, or otherwise to exercise any
legislative or judicial functions in the Protectorate."</p>
<p>With reference to the second point, and especially the relation of the
Imperial</p>
<p>Officer and the Australasian Governments, the following is the written
opinion of</p>
<p>Sir Peter Scratchley:&mdash;</p>
<p>"A Crown Colony, with the simplest machinery for its government, will
probably be the best. The judicial powers of the Governor should be such as to
enable him to deal summarily with minor offences, and to remit, say to the
Queensland Courts, offences of a more serious nature. Everything will, at
first, be necessarily of a tentative character.</p>
<p>"What proportion of the expense of the cost of government will be borne by
the Imperial Government? This is of paramount importance. If the whole of the
expense is to be borne by the Colonies, the Imperial Government will
practically have no control, and I foresee that a deadlock must eventually
arise between the Imperial officer and the Australasian Governments.</p>
<p>"The exercise of tact, patience, and diplomacy will keep matters going for
the first two or three years; but the deadlock will ultimately occur, as he
will be dealing with half-a-dozen Governments, all holding more or less
divergent views."</p>
<p>With regard also to the method of contributing, Sir Peter Scratchley writes
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The ignorance of the intentions of the Colonial Office as to the future
creates difficulties in the colonial Governments coming to an agreement with
the Imperial Government on the subject of the cost of governing British Now
Guinea.</p>
<p>"Until full information is given on all points, there is little prospect of
a permanent settlement of the question, and the policy of the Australian
colonies will continue to be of a hand-to-mouth character.</p>
<p>"The object should be to get the several Governments to propose acts of
Special Appropriation to their local Parliaments, in order to permanently
secure the contributions to be granted yearly to Her Majesty.</p>
<p>"An Act has been passed in Queensland, and, although that Government
declines to increase its contribution, there is little fear of the Act being
repealed.</p>
<p>"It is doubtful whether the other Governments will do more than vote the
contribution yearly. If so, every year there will be discussions, more or less
unpleasant, in the local Parliaments; and it will be difficult for the Imperial
officer in charge to look ahead and establish an economical
administration."</p>
<p>It has also been suggested that&mdash;</p>
<p>(1.)The payments should be made half-yearly.</p>
<p>(2.) The financial year should commence on 1st January instead of 1st
June.</p>
<p>Pending the settlement of these important political questions. Sir Peter
Scratchley had intended to restrain, as far as possible for the present, the
indiscriminate influx of white traders until the necessary machinery for
control over whites and natives had been established. In order to obtain this,
he had proposed establishing a chain of Government officials at various points
along the coast.</p>
<p>Each Sub-Commissioner would have to be provided with a house, a schooner or
whaleboat, one trusty and reliable European, and a crew of Solomon Islanders or
Fijians, who should all be married. The duties of the Sub-Commissioner would
be&mdash;to act as port officer, health officer, &amp;c.; to superintend all
commercial transactions between natives and whites; to adjudicate on all cases
arising between them and white men; to initiate the cultivation of grain for
the natives; to encourage exports of natural products; to superintend and
report upon all local industries; to control and advise all exploring
expeditions in his district. The salary of the Sub-Commissioner should be at
&pound;400 a year. The establishment of these officers would be preparatory to,
and a means of, systematically opening up the country, so that, when an influx
took place, not only would it be possible to exercise control, but the lands
best adapted for various industries could be at once pointed out.</p>
<p>After carefully considering all hydrographical, sanitary, and tribal
conditions, it will perhaps be found that the best sites for these ports, which
would be ports of entry, would be as follows:&mdash;Cornwallis Island, which
would command the entrance to the various rivers on the Western Coast. The
situation is healthy, and it is within easy communication of Thursday Island
and Port Moresby. The central seat of Government would be at Port Moresby, for
reasons mentioned above; and the Government Resident would have charge of that
district from Hall Sound to Hula. Aroma would be another centre, extending over
the Hood Bay district, and along the coast to South Capo. Dinner Island could
be made another centre, to control Milne Bay, the Louisiade Archipelago, and
the D'Entrecasteaux Group; while it might be found necessary to have an officer
stationed at Rawden Bay, for the purpose of controlling the North-East Coast
from Bentley Bay to Mitre Rock.</p>
<p>With regard to the natives, it had been Sir Peter Scratchley's intention to
have formed depots at these ports of entry, and elsewhere, to which the natives
might be induced to bring trade. Regulations would be in force at these depots
controlling the prices to be paid to the natives, the method of conducting
trading operations, &amp;c.</p>
<p>As the area of square miles in the Protected Territory is estimated at
80,382 sq. miles, some portion of this might be handed over to a company for
administrative and commercial purposes. It had been the intention of Sir Peter
Scratchley to have encouraged in Australia the formation of a trading company
on a basis somewhat similar to the British North Borneo Company. With regard,
however, to the tenure of land by this proposed company, Sir Peter Scratchley
consulted the experience of Sir F. Whittaker, whose opinion it will be
pertinent to quote:&mdash;"I may say that, if the Australian Company is to be
empowered to acquire and cultivate land, this would, I think, be very
objectionable; in fact, would at once introduce into New Guinea all the
objectionable features that have been incident to the colonization of New
Zealand and Fiji, in an exaggerated form. If, on the other hand, the Australian
Now Guinea Company intends only to establish trading stations on sites to be
held under license from the Crown, then I think it would be of great use in
promoting the interests and civilization of the inhabitants, and therefore
should receive encouragement and assistance."</p>
<p>Referring to the statement made by the Auditor-General of Queensland, 1st
February, it will be seen that the amount received for the year 1884-5 was
&pound;15,171, the actual amount expended from 1st January, 1885, to 30th
January, 1886, being &pound;15,018. Adding &pound;500 to this for outstanding
accounts, the total expenditure would amount to &pound;15,518. It will be
remembered that the amount &pound;15,171 was the amount due from the Colonial
Governments from 1st June, 1884, to 1st Juno, 1885. As the contributions for
the year 1st June, 1885, to 1st June, 1886, have not yet been paid in, there is
consequently a very considerable balance to the New Guinea account, and not a
deficit as publicly stated.</p>
<p>Moreover, by referring to Sir Peter Scratchley's memorandum of 1st April,
1885, forwarded to the Governments of the Australasian colonies, it will be
seen that ho divided expenditure into three heads&mdash;(a) Capital, or first
cost, to be raised as a loan; (b) Estimated expenditure for the first year; (c)
Annual expenditure for years subsequent. Had he lived to have carried out this
classification, which was approved of by the Colonial Governments, many of the
items&mdash;such as building of houses, &amp;c.,&mdash;which, under the
Auditor-General's Report, appear as annual expenditure, would have been charged
to a loan or first cost account. In no way can the expenditure of the year from
January, 1885, to January, 1886, be taken as the basis for future expenditure.
The work done by Sir Peter Scratchley was preparatory and tentative. He
states&mdash;"I consider that my duty is to examine and report upon the country
for the information of the Imperial Government."</p>
<p>If any systematic administration of the country be attempted, the machinery
of government will have to be increased, thereby involving increased
expenditure both in&mdash;(a) Capital, or first cost; (b) In salaries of
Government officers. The principal items under (a), or first cost, will be the
building of the houses for the Sub-Commissioners along the coast, providing
accommodation for native police, providing whale-boats, &amp;c. The increased
expenditure under Schedule B will be the salaries of the Sub-Commissioners and
native police, the establishment of a regular mail service, &amp;c. It can,
however, be reasonably anticipated that the increased expenditure for
administration will index a proportionate increased development of natural
sources of revenue.</p>
<p>It has been confidently anticipated by those who have seen the fertility of
the Protected Territory, and its capacity for producing articles of tropical
growth, that it will ere long become self-supporting. Although in its present
condition this, perhaps, would hardly be possible, yet the following methods of
raising a revenue to defray local expenditure might be found practical and
economical:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1.) License fees on all <i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i> and pearl fishing boats.
These would be registered, and have to report themselves at Port Moresby at
least once a year.</p>
<p>(2 ) License fees for the erection of smoke huts and copra stations.</p>
<p>(3.) Export duties on cedar and malava, at a fixed rate for so many 100
superficial feet of timber; <i>ad valorem</i> duties on sandal woods and black woods.
With reference to this last duty, I may mention that one timber trader alone,
if he had paid on his privileges according to Queensland timber dues, would owe
the Government about &pound;2,000. The Customs officers at Cooktown and
Townsville might, with the consent of the Queensland Government, be empowered
to act for the New Guinea Protectorate.</p>
<p>(4.) Funds arising from trading licences, judicial fees, harbour dues, and
leases of certain unoccupied lands.</p>
<p>(5.) Import duties.</p>
<p>(6.) Native contributions to the expenses of government. These would have to
be paid in kind, and could hardly be calculated as a source of revenue for some
years to come.</p>
<p>The question with regard to New Guinea which at present is most prominent is
whether it can be made a successful outlet for capital, or, in other words, a
commercial success. Before, however, considering this point, it will be
necessary to recall the fact that New Guinea was primarily annexed for a
strategical purpose. Its value to Australia in this respect has not been
diminished by the fact that portion of the country has been ceded to Germany.
Not only is the British territory nearest the Australian shores; but it
contains the best climate, the finest harbours and ports, the most fertile
lands, the largest rivers. The object, therefore, for which the country was
primarily annexed has been obtained, and its strategical and negative value in
this respect is not unfrequently lost sight of by those who only look for
positive financial results.</p>
<p>The next point which demands attention is the responsibility which rests
with the annexing powers with regard to the protection of the natives.
Probably, in no country, and at no period of history, was there a more
favourable opportunity for successfully adjusting the mutual interests of
European and blacks than in British New Guinea. On both moral as well as
politic grounds, it is essential that the natives should be protected, not only
negatively from aggressive violence and usurpation on the part of the whites,
but positively also from moral contamination and corruption. Regulations with
regard to the introduction of spirituous liquors must not exist merely on
paper&mdash;they must be strictly and rigidly enforced; and, as far as is
practicable, the system of appointing teachers to official positions must be
avoided. The following statement with reference to this question appears among
Sir Peter Scratchley's notes:&mdash;"The only hope of making Now Guinea pay is
the employment of the natives, who can, by patience and care, be trained. If
they disappear, other natives will have to be imported. Putting, therefore, the
protection of the natives on the lowest ground, it will be seen that it will be
cheaper to preserve and educate them. New Guinea must be governed for the
natives and by the natives."</p>
<p>The future of the country depends largely upon the attitude of the natives.
If they are rendered either hostile or corrupt, then it will continue to be the
hunting ground of needy adventurers or desperate speculators; if, on the other
hand, they learn confidence in their rulers then settlement in many parts is
possible, and the country may become the regular source of supply of tropical
products to the Australian markets. On this point, therefore, the duty of the
Government and the interest of the speculator coincide, and if, in the scheme
for the administration of the country, the positive protection of the natives
be comprehended, the introduction of European capital will materially benefit
them, will create in them a useful and willing instrument, and thus be the
first means towards rendering financial success ultimately possible.</p>
<p>Briefly to summarize the foregoing points&mdash;</p>
<p>(1.) Now Guinea was primarily annexed for a strategical purpose&mdash;that
purpose has been obtained.</p>
<p>(2.) Having been annexed, it is the duty of the annexing power to protect
the natives.</p>
<p>(3.) It is doubtful whether the country can ever be self-supporting, partly
on account of the climate, and partly owing to the attitude and condition of
the natives.</p>
<p>(4.) Nothing can be done towards systematically administering the country
and developing its resources until it is made an integral part of the
Anglo-Australian political system, and the position of the officer
administering its Government, both with regard to the country itself, and also
to the authorities to whom he is responsible, shall have have been more
definitely determined.</p>

<h3>OFFICIAL REPORT<br>
OF<br>
CAPT. H C. EVERILL,<br>
Leader of the New Guinea Exploring Expedition.</h3>
<blockquote>Meeting of the Geographical Society of Australasia to receive the
Official Report of Captain H. C. Everill, Leader of the Society's New Guinea
Exploring Expedition.</blockquote>
<p>A public meeting in connection with the New South Wales Branch of the
Geographical Society of Australasia was held in the Royal Society's room,
Elizabeth Street, yesterday afternoon. His Excellency the Governor presided,
and in addition to a large audience of ladies and gentlemen, there were upon
the platform Messrs. E. De Faur, Thompson, M.A. (Secretary to the Queensland
Branch of the Society), Gerard (Hon Treasurer), Myring (Hon. Secretary), Sir
Edward Strickland, K.C.B. (President), and other gentlemen. The principal
business of the meeting was the hearing of an official summary of the results
of the recent expedition to New Guinea, under the leadership of Captain
Everill. A large sketch map of that island had been prepared, from the
plottings of the explorers, by Mr. M. Gautschy, C.E., its measurement being 16
feet by 15, and the scale 4 miles to the inch, and the tracks of recent
exploration parties were shown.</p>
<p>Lord Carrington excused himself from offering any lengthened remarks, on
account of the long programme which was before him, and he called upon the
Honorary Secretary, Mr. T. H. Myring, to read a paper which he had prepared, on
"The aims of the Geographical Society."</p>
<p>Mr. Myring having read his paper, His Excellency then said he would call
upon Captain Everill to read his official report of the recent expedition,
which was the principal business of the meeting.</p>
<h4>EXPLORATION OF NEW GUINEA&mdash;CAPTAIN EVERILL'S REPORT.</h4>
<p>On Wednesday, June l0th, s.s. "Bonito" left Sydney in tow of the "Egmont"
with part of the exploratory party on board, in charge of Mr. Hemsworth,
Nautical Sub-leader, Drs. Haacke, Bernays, and Messrs. Senior and Vogan
following with myself in the steamer "Wentworth." We left Sydney about 4.30
p.m. on Saturday, June 13th, the President, Sir E. Strickland, with the
Administrative Council, and many of our friends being kind enough to see the
last of us, and bid us God's speed. Mr. Maiden, Hon. Secretary, accompanied us
to Brisbane, partly in connection with the departure of the expedition, but
mainly to assist in forming a new Branch of the Society in Brisbane, which I am
glad to say is now successfully formed. After a rather rough voyage we arrived
in Brisbane on Tuesday the 18th instant; the only notable event on the voyage
being a stoppage of some time near the wreck of the steamer "Cahors." During
our short stay in Brisbane, Mr. Maiden and myself called upon such members of
the Queensland Ministry as were in town. We also were fortunate enough, through
the kindness of the Postmaster-General, to obtain the free use of the
Government telegraphs for the transmission of news to the Society. I here
found, from the Nautical Sub-leader's report, that the "Bonito" had encountered
very heavy weather on her passage, and was somewhat strained by a heavy sea
striking her. However, on inspecting her I found the damage was apparently not
sufficient to delay her voyage, and made arrangement for a temporary repair to
enable her to proceed on the morrow, thus avoiding a delay here as the steamer
to Thursday Island only connects once a fortnight. Accordingly the "Bonito"
left Moreton Bay at 2 p.m. on the 17th, in tow of s.s. "Wentworth." Our party
with the exception of Senior (who had joined the "Bonito" at Sandgate) leaving
by the s.s. "Alexandra" some hours later. I must here take the opportunity of
thanking the Queensland Government for their kindness and the assistance so
freely accorded us during the progress of the expedition.</p>
<p>From Brisbane to Cooktown we had a pleasant voyage, the "Alexandra" taking
the "Bonito in tow from Townsville. At Cooktown we found the steamer "Advance,"
which the Queensland Government had kindly sent to convey us to the mouth of
the river Aird. I saw Captain Williams the night we arrived, and found that he
objected to go to the Aird, and he strongly recommended me to go elsewhere; but
as my instructions did not permit my making such an alteration in the plans of
the Council, I of course could not discuss the question; explaining that the
Society had matured their plans and issued their instructions after
considerable deliberation, and that I could not think of any deviation from the
line laid down by them, unless I had the direct evidence of its
impracticability from some one of local experience, which Captain Williams was
unable to give me; his objections being principally founded on rumour, and not
on practical experience. However, I telegraphed to the Society, but as the
steamer left at daylight next morning could not get a reply. I also, on Captain
Williams's request, put to paper what I had previously said.</p>
<p>We arrived at Thursday Island June 20th, went alongside the A. S. N.
Company's hulk to coal and tranship provisions; but before doing this, in
accordance with my instructions, I had the "Bonito" surveyed, and found that
she required some repairs; the heavy tow, together with the high seas
experienced between Sydney and Brisbane having strained her considerably. These
repairs were effected under the survey of Captain Wilkie, Government Pilot, and
Captain Dubbins of the "Elsca." While these repairs were proceeding, the
scientific staff made what collections they could on Thursday and adjacent
Islands. These collections, together with some sketches and photos, were duly
forwarded to the Society before our departure, and I have learnt since our
return that they were very good, some novelties having been found among them;
so that it is satisfactory to know that our unavoidable detention was not time
lost. While at Thursday Island I received a telegram from the President
requesting me not to attempt the Aird River or to cross the Gulf of Papua. This
telegram altering the whole plan of the expedition, and in fact forbidding me
going eastward of the River Fly; but fortunately the Rev. Mr. M'Farlane coming
to Thursday Island enabled me to obtain his valuable advice and experience; and
after some consultation with him and the Hon. Mr. John Douglas, I resolved to
go up the river Fly, and to take the first large branch to the eastward. Mr.
M'Farlane, who was then on his way to the river Fly, kindly offering to assist
me in obtaining interpreters, &amp;c. This circumstance, together with that of
Mr. Douglas who was also going to Kewei in the "Mavis," afforded us an
excellent opportunity of going in company, and giving the Society the advantage
of the report of a good clear start.</p>
<p>As a great deal has been written in the Press about our equipment of
fire-arms, I may here state that the majority of the fire-arms sent by Messrs.
Hoffnung and Co. to Thursday Island wore found unsuitable from various causes,
and did not correspond with the copy I received from the Secretary of the
President's order to that firm (the fire-arms not being selected by myself, or
any opportunity of inspecting them having been given me before arrival at
Thursday Island), so I called a survey on them, and such as were condemned I
sent back to Sydney, and after considerable trouble, managed to replace them
from Thursday Island, Cooktown, and Townsville. But when we left Thursday
Island, our armament was quite complete in every respect, as per list, and
Sub-leader's receipt forwarded to the Society, which I read.</p>
<p><b>List of Fire-arms.</b><br>
<br>
8 Winchester repeating rifles,<br>
3 Sniders,<br>
6 Double-barrel fowling pieces,<br>
1 Rook rifle,<br>
5 Colt's improved revolvers (6 chambers),<br>
13 Bull-dog revolvers (6 chambers),<br>
with an abundance of cartridges and reloaders, with spare powder and shot.</p>
<p>These firearms were, I consider, quite sufficient for our party, consisting
of twelve Europeans and twelve Malays.</p>
<p>The repairs, together with the difficulty of obtaining firearms, detained us
on Thursday Island until July 14th; our party also here became one
short&mdash;Mr. Broadbent returning to Sydney sick&mdash;and on leaving
Thursday Island consisted of the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>Dr. Haacke, Chief Scientist (Zoology and Geology);<br>
Dr. Bernays, M.D., and Botanist;<br>
Mr. Hemsworth, Nautical Sub-leader;<br>
Mr. Creagh, Land Sub-leader;<br>
Mr. Froggart, Zoological Collector and Entomologist;<br>
Mr. Bauerlin, Botanical Collector;<br>
Mr. Senior, Surveyor and Explorer;<br>
Mr. Shaw, Photographer and Explorer;<br>
Mr. Vogan, Artist and Explorer;<br>
Mr. M'Gechan, Engineer and Explorer;<br>
Mr. Waddick, Seaman and Explorer;<br>
and eleven Malays and one cook Cingalese, the Malay names being difficult to
remember. Some of the most facetious of the party re-christened them by the
following names, which will be found used in the narratives. Marco Polo,
Barabas, Lucy, Scotch Lizzie, Anchises, Chandos, &amp;c.</p>
<p>While in Thursday Island, we received every assistance from the Hon. Mr.
John Douglas, and Mr. Bowden, of Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Co., was good enough
to place their jetty at our disposal, besides assisting us in many other
ways.</p>

<b>50. Fly River Explorers, Signer Luigi Maria D'Albertis, and Captain H. C.
Everill (on one Plate)</b><br>
<br></p>
<p>We left Thursday Island; I having arranged a rendezvous with the "Mavis" and
"Mary" at Missionary Pass, it was intended that the "Advance" should tow the
"Bonito," but an incident prevented it. But however, we all arrived at
Missionary on July 17th, excepting the "Mavis," and next morning left for the
Fly in tow of the "Advance." At noon the "Advance" cast us off at the mouth of
the Fly, and we proceeded under steam, following the missionary lugger "Mary,"
and at 4 p.m. anchored off Neboo, taking our first hold of New Guinea soil.
After anchoring, found the "Mavis," which, through the kindness of the
Queensland Government and the Hon. John Douglas, had taken twenty tons of coal
for our use, was on the other side of the island, and we made arrangements for
getting her up next day.</p>
<p>Neboo, the first settlement made by the missionaries, is a large, low, sandy
island, with an abundance of cocoa-nut and other palms growing on it. It does
not appear to contain any regular inhabitants, but the natives from the
neighbouring islands and villages come periodically to collect nuts and cut the
nepa palm-leaves for roofing their houses. The missionary establishment is now
moved from Neboo to Kewei. The anchorage is a deep channel between two islands,
where a vessel can lie in smooth water. In the river, which is very wide here,
a very nasty sea and swell is constantly experienced during the south-east
monsoons. We remained at Neboo until Sunday morning, July 10th, when our
squadron (now consisting of the "Mavis," "Mary," "Venture," and "Bonito") went
over to Kewei, which is a village situated on the north side of the channel.
After anchoring there, Messrs. Douglas, MacFarlane, Captain Cater, and myself,
went on shore, taking four of the "Mavis" men with us. I intended to have
landed a collecting party, but it was not considered wise to do so; the old
chief, Duropa, having attacked the teachers of the mission a month or so
previously, with a view of making bacon or "long pig" of them, wild pigs being
uncommonly scarce that season. Mr. Douglas and myself landed first, and found a
few natives completely naked, grouped in front of a large house, the principal
of whom was an old white-headed man, intelligent looking, to whom Mr. Douglas,
with his usual good nature, immediately gave a new suit of serge clothes, and
assisted him to don them. This was hardly done, when up came Mr. MacFarlane,
with Captain Cater, and to our great dismay we found that we had made friends
with the wrong man, and that it was the chief "cannibal himself" that we had
been making "chums" with. We remained on shore the rest of the day, and walked
through the villages and plantations, seeing some curious looking graves, and
some remarkably fine sago palms. The natives did not strike me as being
particularly friendly. We saw no women; all the houses on Duropa's side of the
creek being closed up, and the men and women had gone to another village on the
approach of our vessels, but I distinctly heard the voices of women in
suppressed tones inside the houses.</p>
<p>Kewei consists of two villages, separated by a salt-water creek. The natives
on the east side of the creek (which is bridged by a method peculiar to the
Malay countries) being far more friendly than those on the west. There appears
to be no fresh water near the village. We intended to have landed some coal
here, and to have formed a depot, but the sea and surf were too heavy to
attempt it, and we concluded to make the depot at Sumanti, the next large river
further up, and after finishing our business here. We left Kewei for Sumanti at
noon, 20th July, the "Mary" going back to Thursday Island, and the "Mavis"
accompanying us. We anchored off the village about 4 p.m., and when about to
land discovered that by some mistake no interpreters had been brought. Sumanti
lies at the mouth of a creek, at the edge of which we saw a number of natives
waving a white flag. I landed with four Europeans and four Malays of my own
party, armed, and found the natives exceedingly friendly, and after
distributing some presents among them returned on board. We remained here
landing coal and spare stores until July 23rd, and the scientific staff
collecting. We found the natives very docile and friendly on the whole, Mr.
Douglas especially succeeding in gaining their friendship and I may say
affection. After the departure of the "Mavis," I succeeded in obtaining the
services of three Papuans, viz., Korossa, Atar, and Gesau, who have since
attained considerable notoriety throughout the world. I left Sumanti the same
afternoon about four hours after the "Mavis," and pushed up the river as
rapidly as possible, my object being to get up the river while the party were
fresh, and before sickness attacked us. We found little difficulty in getting
through the islands at the north of the river, and clearly made out the passage
at the north end of the Kewei, hitherto not named, and which I purpose naming
Griffiths Channel; the north-west point of Kewei, C. Dickson; and keeping the
whale-boat ahead sounding, we reached the main banks of the river Fly on
Saturday, July 20th, naming the point to the southward, which is a good
distinguishing mark, and the first point that you can get between the regular
banks, Fortescue Point.</p>
<p>Here are two or three large villages on the south side of the river, but the
water was too shallow on that side to go close in; so standing across to the
north side of the river, we found a deeper channel. The right or north bank of
the river here appears to form another entrance from the sea farther to the
eastward. This entrance I have named the M'Ilwraith Channel, in commemoration
of the first annexation of New Guinea by the M'Ilwraith Ministry. We now
steamed between the main banks of this river.</p>
<p>The river here is wide, and there are at least two deep-water channels, but
also a number of shoals and sand-banks. The trees are very high and the foliage
is luxuriant. In places on the left bank are numbers of cocoa-nut and banana
plantations. We also began to get among the pandanus, and a very bright green
tree, commonly known as the fresh water mangrove, we saw no signs of natives on
the north side, excepting a bridge across a creek. The greater portion of the
country appeared very swampy, and the banks are only just out of the reach of
high water. We passed on the north side two lots of red cliffs, forming small
hills forty feet high. One of these corresponds with D'Alberti's Howling Place.
Passing through the Fairfax Group, which is formed of small islands almost
under water, very thickly wooded with high trees, we anchored for the night;
next morning we proceeded up the river, meeting the same kind of scenery, low
banks, covered in places with the fresh-water mangrove, and again we found the
banks ten and fourteen feet high in detached and broken places, and composed
of red clay. We also came across immense numbers of flying foxes.</p>
<p>We saw no signs of permanent houses, but the remains of temporary shelters,
and the only sign of human life was a solitary canoe made fast into the bank.
Animal life was well represented by black cockatoos, numerous pigeons,
hornbills, small green parrots, lorrykeets, with plenty of swallows and smaller
birds. The banks of the river were a little higher (in places), and had been
cleared in places, now overgrown with coarse grass and bamboo, the remains of
native houses. We found very deep water, seven and eight fathoms, no bottom.
The weather was squally, with showers and strong south-east winds blowing.
Higher up the river, as we neared the Ellengowan Island, the banks appeared
covered in places with a species of long reeds or grass, of the same family as
sugar-cane; and wherever these appear there is generally a mud or sand-flat
extending a little way from the shore. We went round the north side of
Ellengowan Island, and on getting to the west of it, saw a village on the south
side, but did not stop.</p>
<p>Above Ellengowan Island, the birds appear to become scarcer; but in some
places the trees were literally black with flying foxes, hanging like pears on
a tree. The vegetation appears the same, but there are no signs of coca-nuts to
be found; and from the masthead the country presents a more open appearance.
The river above Ellengowan Island is not nearly so straight as it is below, it
winds in almost complete circles, so that progress up country was much slower
here. Alligator tracks are very numerous, the country generally low and swampy,
and very few birds about. We did not see any natives for a considerable
distance, until we saw a canoe round a point ahead, with some men, apparently
drawing their bows. We stationed our party to act on the defensive, and held
out a large table-cloth as a sign of friendship.</p>
<p>On rounding the point we found a large number of canoes full of men, who
kept pulling ahead, close into the bank, until they entered a small creek. On
both sides of the river there were a large number of low houses, roofed in a
very primitive manner, and standing about four feet high; these houses were
apparently abandoned by everybody excepting one man, who extended his arms,
evidently to show that he was not armed, and was friendly disposed. He was
black, and perfectly nude, excepting the usual shell, which the Sumautese call
"We-der-ow." The creek that the canoes had entered we found connected with the
river round a small grassy island. I did not stop to communicate with these
natives; but as we passed them I saw several of them in the trees watching us,
and when we had passed by, the canoes came out of the creek again, apparently
greatly relieved at our not having molested them. We now found the country
altering a great deal. The outstretching spits were now more sandy than before,
and the country appeared more open; grassy plains stretching to the westward,
where I could also see several lagoons inland, and to the north-west there
appeared higher land thickly wooded. About 4.30 p.m. on the same day, July
28th, we came to a junction of the river, one arm going north-east and the
other north-west. On the east point of this junction, where the sand spit
extended, it was completely covered with large logs of drift-wood, forming, in
fact, a complete timber stack. I carefully examined both branches, and finding
a strong current and large logs of wood drifting down the north-east branch,
determined upon ascending that river, it lying in the direction the Society
wished to explore. This branch joins the Fly in latitude 7 degrees 34 minutes
south, longitude 141 degrees 21 minutes east; I named this the Strickland
River, in honour of Sir E. Strickland, President of the Administrative Council
of this Society, and Chairman of the Melbourne Geographical Conference, at
which the New Guinea Expedition was decided upon.</p>
<p>We upon the voyage wondered why this river was not noticed in Mr. Hargrave's
notes concerning the exploration of the river Fly (<i>vide</i> vol. i. of the
Society's proceedings), and unfortunately had no copy of D'Alberti's work with
us; but since returning I have read his work on New Guinea, and find in vol.
ii., page 260, that he discovered this opening, and says in his account of his
third voyage:&mdash;"For half our voyage the river appeared to be of the same
breadth, but after we had passed a large opening, which occurs on the right
bank, in a north-easterly direction, and which I must confess I do not remember
observing last year, it becomes much narrower, and runs between two banks
covered with grass. I think the opening we saw to-day may be the river Alice,
which, after leaving the Fly River at Snake Point, returns here. I intend on
our return to explore it." (Which, however, he never did).</p>
<p>I may here say that, on our return, we ascended the Fly for two and a half
hours twelve minutes, and found the country above the junction much as
D'Albertis describes it, and the Fly taking a westerly, and even a
west-south-westerly direction; and even the country on the south side of the
Fly and that on the east side of the Strickland River differ greatly in my
opinion. Ascending the Strickland River we stopped one day for collecting and
cutting fire-wood; and proceeding upwards found the current getting much
stronger, and at first we saw no signs of natives. The sand-spits became more
numerous, and the sand is of a darker colour.</p>
<p>A little higher up we again began to pass native shelters, and some small
canoes. In the bends of the river there were many large logs of drift timber
stranded; also many large snags stationary in the middle of the channel, now
easily kept clear of as they were in sight. Rut they would have proved very
dangerous if the river had been a few feet higher. Still higher up, the banks
began to rise a little, and the trees and vegetation changed. The river is
constantly changing its channel; one side continually being washed away, while
a bank is forming on the other; and in places the water appears to have cut a
new channel, and formed comparatively large islands in the middle of the
river, with the stream running on both sides. The newly-formed land is covered
in some places with a short bright green grass; in others with long reeds. The
red cliffs also occur again in small hillocks, 25 to 40 feet high. They are
formed of red and yellow ochre; the side facing the river generally being
steep, and almost perpendicular; and it appears as if the water had literally
cut its way through them. The other side presents the usual flat bank, with
brown alluvial soil, and is thickly wooded with forest trees. These hills occur
very frequently, and wherever found the river makes a broad circuit and comes
up with them again after some distance has been traversed.</p>
<p>We now found the native shelters and abandoned houses becoming more
plentiful; and, though we saw no natives we heard them, and also heard their
dogs howling. The level of the river we found to be rapidly rising, the current
getting stronger, and its direction more circuitous. We continued to ascend the
river, stopping in the forenoon to collect and take observations, still passing
the same scenery; but the rain squalls were now left behind, and the air became
clearer. At 8 a.m. on Sunday, August 2nd, on rounding a bend, a change of
scenery took place; a grassy flat appearing ahead, and to the westward of us
the country appeared more open from E.N.E. to S.E., and a little further up I
found that the river formed a large circle, and branched to the E. S.E. and
N.N.E. I kept to the easterly one, as it turned to the north a little higher
up; but the other branch (which I have since named the Service River) will, I
think be found to connect with the river Fly at Snake Point, opposite the
junction of the Alice River&mdash;in fact that south-south-easterly branch
which D'Albortis speaks of.</p>
<p>The river now got much more difficult to navigate, on account of the large
snags in the middle of the stream. The water constantly undermining the concave
bank, when the freshets come down very large portions of the bank are washed
away, leaving the trees in the middle of the river, where they lodge, and in
places almost form rapids. For instance, we passed close here some enormous
trees grounded in 45 feet of water, and forming a fence of snags in two or
three places right across the river, leaving barely room for the "Bonito" to
steer between them. A few miles above Service Junction we saw some canoes full
of people, who at first showed a hostile front, but, as we approached nearer,
deserted their canoes and took to the jungle. I showed a white flag, and made
friendly signs, but without effect, and landing a party tried to communicate
but did not succeed in assuring them of our friendly intentions. I left them
some presents of cloth, tomahawks, tobacco, beads, &amp;c., and selecting some
articles from their canoes, which were very full of their household goods,
proceeded on our voyage. The current was now getting too strong for us to stem
when burning a mixture of wood and coal, as we had been doing for some days,
and we had to burn all coal to get steam enough to make headway at all. On
Monday, August 3rd, our first and only serious brush with the natives
occurred.</p>
<p>Early in the morning we saw a number of canoes on a sand-spit, and on
approaching, finding some of the natives standing their ground, I took the
dingy, and with two Malays, pulled for the shore, standing up in the boat with
my arms outstretched to give them confidence, and to show that I was not armed.
I landed, thinking that the fact of my being unarmed and distributing presents
among them, would perhaps gain their friendship and confidence, but I soon
found myself placed in a very critical position; the natives increasing in
numbers, and coming up in full war paint, brandishing their weapons, and some
of them pointing their arrows at me. In fact, the only way I prevented them
from shooting was by walking towards such of them as appeared the most hostile,
and assuming an unconcern which I confess I was far from feeling. I remained on
shore perhaps fifteen or twenty minutes and thought myself very lucky in
getting off with a whole skin.</p>
<p>The story of the attack afterwards made is fully written in my journal, and
all I will here say of the matter is, that finding it impossible to communicate
with them I steamed up the river, the natives following along the banks. On
nearing the bend we saw a village which the natives made for. Seeing them
hostile, I blew the steam whistle, which they did not appear to mind. They now
mustered eighty to one hundred fighting men (there were only forty-six when I
interviewed them on shore), and seeing them make preparations to fire I called
the man in from leading, and sent the Malay off the bridge, taking the wheel
myself. In less time than it takes to relate we were saluted with a perfect
shower of arrows, some striking and some going over the vessel; luckily none of
us being hit. I reluctantly gave the order to fire, and they were dispersed
after some shots. The same afternoon we grounded on the first hard bottom we
had met with in the river, and being only about four miles miles from the
village, were placed in a very dangerous position.</p>
<p>Finding the water leaving us rapidly, with a view to meet any emergency,
after landing the coal, &amp;c., to lighten the vessel, I had a clearing made,
and built the framework of a house, intending to make a permanent depot there
in case of the water not rising, or in the event of anything happening to the
"Bonito." The clearing was made, and the house ready fur roofing when, on
August 8th, the water rose, and the "Bonito" was afloat again. Taking in the
stores again as quickly as possible, we proceeded up the river. We named this
reach "Douglas Bend," after the Hon. John Douglas, C.M.G. The bed of the river
is here composed of hard large shingle, and the current is so rapid that it is
impossible to stem it with a boat. Just above where we stranded we found a
passage with only eight feet of water on it during the freshets. Proceeding
onwards, the river began to get much shallower, in places giving barely water
enough for the "Bonito" to steam over, and a hard shingle bottom formed the bed
of the river, with no anchorage for the rest of our voyage. The red cliffs
became more numerous, and increased in height as we got further up.</p>
<p>At 5 p.m. on August 9th, we came to a dead stop, the river dividing, and
neither channel containing enough water for us. Here we remained fourteen days
before the water rose and enabled us to proceed further up. During this time we
explored and collected round this neighbourhood, and made an attempt to cut our
way into the interior, but did not succeed in getting more than ten miles.
While here, also, our three Sumantese, Korossa, Gesau, and Atau, deserted
us.</p>
<p>As it has been stated that we were massacred in our sleep, and no watch was
kept (although on whose authority I do not know), I may say that the Doctor and
one Malay were on watch, and awake too when the wily Papuans left. We had
established a camp some distance from the vessel, and meant to try and cut
inland from there, when, on August 23rd the waters again rose, and we steamed
further up. On August 24th and 25th we again cut inland in hopes of seeing the
mountains, and attained a position of 250 feet high, by climbing a tree on the
top of a hill, but could find no trace of highland or clear country. We
proceeded further up the river, searching vainly for the mountains, until we
finally grounded, on August 27th, where, as has already been related, the
"Bonito" remained until October 21st. But not without incident, for on the 31st
instant, the gravel washing away from under her caused a capsize, and it was
only by the great exertions of the party that the provisions were landed, and
most likely a great disaster averted, the capsize taking place in the middle of
the night, and the vessel filling with water almost immediately.</p>
<p>The conduct of the party on this occasion is deserving of the highest
praise. After this we housed all our stores on shore, half of us camping and
half remaining on board. In the midst of our troubles we had a visit from
hostile natives, who luckily were dispersed without bloodshed. After righting
the "Bonito," drying and housing our stores, we again tried to cut inland, but
found too many difficulties in the way to hope for any success in gaining the
mountains in that way; so after two or three preliminary excursions in which we
could find no definite traces of mountains or open country, I organized a boat
expedition, and on September 16th, left Mr. Hemsworth in command on board the
"Bonito," with the following party:&mdash;</p>
<p>Dr. Bernays, in charge of sick, which numbered seven.<br>
Senior, sick.<br>
Vogan, sick.<br>
Bauerlin, to continue his collecting.<br>
M'Gechan, engineer.<br>
Malays&mdash;Mandore, sick, boil and fever.<br>
Carpenter, cut his leg half through with an axe.<br>
Barabas, foot injured.<br>
Fireman, ditto.<br>
Anchises, fever and unsound.</p>
<p>Lous, cook, troubled with fever and not fit for hard work. We broke up the
camp on shore, having previously built a house for the provisions under the
bank where it was covered by the rifles of the "Bonito."</p>
<p>The whale-boat party consisted of Dr. Haacks, Messrs. Froggart, Shaw, Creagh
(Sub-leader), Waddick, six Malays&mdash;the only sound ones at my
disposal&mdash;and myself.</p>
<p>We named our station here "Observatory Bend;" it is in lat. 6&deg; 38' 30"
S. long. 142&deg; E. Our boat contained tents, trade, instruments, Sec, and
with ten days' provisions, twelve men, sails, awning, &amp;c., was fully laden,
in fact too crowded for convenience. It being my intention to try and discover
the position of the mountains, and failing to do that to ascend the river as
far as possible.</p>
<p>Accordingly we proceeded on the morning of the IGth, sometimes using the
oars in the slack water reaches, but mostly six or eight hands wading through
the water tracking or towing the boat with a rope over the sharp stones. We
frequently had to cross and recross the river, sometimes to cut away snags to
get the boat through, the river becoming more difficult if possible every mile
we ascended; even if the "Bonito" had not been stranded she could not have got
two miles further up the river. The Red Hills becoming more frequent and rising
in altitude as we ascended, but still of the same formation, excepting that the
lower strata is very much honeycombed and of a duller colour.</p>
<p>The birds were represented by parrots, hornbills, many and various
descriptions of pigeons, including the Goura or crested pigeon, night herons,
eaglets, swifts, swallows, cockatoos white and black, many varieties of
king-fishers and king-hunters, small insect and honey-eating birds,
cassowaries, oriels, and occasionally we have heard the note of the bird of
Paradise. We had not yet seen any four-footed animals in New Guinea, and only
tracks of pigs, and some which we afterwards found to be those of bandicoots
and rats. There were many tracks of alligators, which caused us considerable
anxiety, as our men were in the water fully three-quarters of the day. Also, we
found many tracks of river turtle, but although we frequently tried the river
with fishing-lines we caught nothing, and even by dynamiting all the likely
places we only got a few cat-fish and some smaller species resembling
minnows.</p>
<p>There were many descriptions of non-edible wild fruits, including a large
variety of figs, a species of broad-fruit just fruiting, which afterwards
proved an excellent article of food; the sago palm appears to nourish
everywhere about here, as we found it in more or less quantities throughout our
journey. Tree ferns also began to get plentiful; but I leave the details of
these important subjects to be treated by the special scientists who
accompanied the Expedition, and to proceed on our journey.</p>
<p>The river must have been unusually low even for the dry season when we
ascended it, and is very noticeable here from the immense gravel wastes or
circuit of shingle and stone that was now exposed to view from the low state of
the water; in places there being a distance of 1 to 2 miles between the banks
proper of the river; the intervening space being filled with the dry beds of
the river, and small islands formed by the deposits of sand and silt, some of
those islands being thickly wooded. In another place the river runs between two
stacks or neatly piled heaps of large stone or shingle, as level and neatly
stacked as if placed by hand, and in these places, nearly always forming a
rapid, the water rising its level very fast, that sometimes on looking over the
narrow ledge we were tracking the boat along we found the water to be 10 and 12
feet lower than where our boat was floating, giving it the appearance of a
lock-gate only being parallel with the river instead of crossing it. This is of
course caused by the channel being blocked or blind, and the water having the
same level as the lower water-level of the rapid. In some places these rapids
were very difficult of ascent.[*]</p>
<blockquote>[* N-B.&mdash;We always had to get into the water, and drag and
carry the boat over.]</blockquote>
<p>One place notably, we were twelve of us one hour and twenty minutes in the
water holding on to the boat, scarcely gaining anything, the stones shifting
and washing away from under our feet with such force that sometimes the bow of
the boat was afloat and the stern high and dry with the force of the current
washing or wedging the stones under her. It was only with the utmost difficulty
that we could prevent the boat from obtaining the mastery: for the bow to have
moved round one point of the compass meant to us the loss of arms, ammunition,
food, boat, and everything else, and this at a distance of 70 miles from the
depot was at least serious.</p>
<p>The ascent in the whale-boat proved very trying work to the party, made as
it was under a tropical sun directly overhead, our latitude and the sun's
declination being almost approximate. These gravel wastes or circles form
natural reservoirs, and during the rainy season are of course full of water,
and must form quite lakes or lagoons whenever freshets come down the river. We
ascended thus for seven days without much change of scenery, during which time
we saw no natives, but passed plenty of shelters, and occasionally the recent
foot-prints of small parties, and although the red hills got higher as we
ascended, they still kept the east side of the river, and we could not see the
mountains. The channels becoming narrower, and snags more awkward and numerous
as we advanced, making it very difficult to prevent the boat being stove.</p>
<p>On September 22nd, after coming up a long straight reach, we dropped upon a
recent camp of natives on a gravel spit where the river makes a junction and
receives a large tributary apparently directly from the mountains. I think they
must have taken the boat for some new animal seeking to devour them, for they
fled on first sighting us, leaving everything behind them, even to their
fire-sticks. This tributary goes to the north-north-east, while the main river
takes a westerly bend. I name this the Carrington Junction, and the river the
Cecilia River, named in honor of Lady Carrington.</p>
<p>To me the deposit of stone and sand coming from this river differs somewhat
from that of the Strickland. There appeared to be more of the lignite or coal
mixed with the stone, and the magnetic iron-sand was much purer and heavier.
Much as I should have liked to examine the Cecilia I had to keep to the main
stream; and leaving a large present close to the food the natives had
abandoned, and planting a red ensign on a pole, we proceeded.</p>
<p>About here, there must be at times immense bodies of water coming down.
There are a number of dry channels to be seen, looking like roads cut through
the high forest trees; they are almost as straight and regular as if made by
the hands of man; from 80 to 200 yards wide, and many of them contain a fall
of, I should think, 1 in 100 feet.</p>
<p>Soon after passing this junction we saw many signs of human life, and passed
some houses and a very primitive raft. I was also pleased to see the hills,
which hitherto have only appeared on the east side, are now to be found on both
sides, the river now cutting right through them.</p>
<p>The land here is swampy; back from the river and in the gullies close to the
hills the sago palm appears very plentiful, and there are also plenty of
natives hereabouts. The level of the river is also rising very rapidly; it has
quite become a case of getting upstairs to ascend the rapids at all. I should
estimate a rise of 30 feet in the water-level in half a mile in some
places.</p>
<p>The current was so strong that we had to use a number of devices to ascend,
and the snags outlying from the banks made it very dangerous; the current
rushing over and round them made it appear like a series of boiling whirlpools
and breakers, and in many places we had to pass a long rope under the snags up
the river, and make it fast to a snag or tree in the bank, then sheer the boat
outside or between the snags, and haul up foot by foot, fleeting the rope again
and again until we came to easier ground.</p>
<p>But on the afternoon of Thursday, September 24th, on rounding a point we
were rewarded by the sight of a low range of hills about 1,000 feet high, over
which was a complete view of two distinct ranges of mountains, the nearer one
perhaps 50 miles[*], and the farther one 80.</p>
<blockquote>[* Von Mueller range.]</blockquote>
<p>The river now became straighter, and ran between high steep banks, or rather
a series of small hills. I estimated we wore about 18 miles from the lowest
range of hills, and between us and their base the country formed a series of
low hill-ranges 200 to 300 foot high, gradually increasing in height as they
wont north.</p>
<p>We were now nine days from our depot, and our provisions were nearly
finished, part of them having been spoiled by the boat getting stove as we
ascended a rapid; but determining to reach the hills we pushed very hard during
the ensuing three days, and finally reached the base of the hills on Sunday,
September 27th, twelve days after leaving the "Bonito." The river about here
presents a most beautiful appearance; in one place, for instance, a long,
straight reach, with the hills rising in places perpendicularly 300 feet from
the river, which is about 50 to GO feet wide, and flows with groat force
through the gully or funnel formed by the high banks, which are covered with
beautiful trees on the top, and even their steep sides are covered with plants
and vegetation, among which, flowering creepers, ground orchids, ferns, and
tree-ferns are numerous. The country appears to be comparatively thickly
populated. We passed a number of houses and clearings, and a great many very
small canoes. But the natives about here appear to be a very timid race; had
they been hostile they might easily have done us considerable damage, without
our even seeing them; as it was we ascended expecting a shower of arrows every
minute; but instead of attacking us they fled from their houses at our
approach, and the only one we caught sight of was of a light copper-colour,
well made, and clean-limbed, and ornamented with the usual shell. We did not
attempt to enter their houses on the way up, but left presents on the banks
opposite the houses; but on coming down, on examining them, found the houses
had all been deserted for some days, and the presents untouched.</p>
<p>On arriving at the base of the highest range of hills our provisions were
finished, excepting one meal and a little Liebeg's extract, so necessity
compelled almost immediate return. However, Dr. Haacke, Mr. Shaw, and myself,
with three Malays and two dogs, commenced the ascent of what we thought to be
the highest hill, and were lucky enough to gain a ridge or spur, which we
followed over one hill 310 feet high, and from there ascended another 460 feet,
where, as Dr. Haacke wished to return, I sent a Malay back with him, and
proceeding with Shaw and the others gained the top of the hill, which the
aneroid showed to be 750 feet; but to our great disgust we found that other
hills still higher obscured our view to the N.W. and N.N.E., and as it was near
sunset we had to return. We were fortunate enough to get down all right and
reached the camp one hour after sunset, completely done up, rifle, revolver,
axe, &amp;c., being a very heavy handicap for hill-climbing on short
commons.</p>
<p>I estimated the highest position reached to be latitude 5' 30" S., longitude
142&deg; 22' E. Unfortunately we had very heavy thunderstorms at night while up
here, which prevented good observations being taken; but I have a very fair
position, taken from a native house, marked on plan, taken on Monday, September
28th, on our homeward journey.</p>
<p>The country hereabouts, and right as far as we could see to the northwards,
is composed of undulating hills, very heavily wooded, which appear to go as far
as the Von Mueller Range. The further range we saw was very high indeed, and I
think considerably above snow-level. This range will in all probability turn
out to be the northern coastal range.</p>
<p>The lower hills will I think be found admirably adapted for growing coffee,
cinchona, cocoa, gutta, and other valuable tropical productions, while the
lower alluvial lands cannot fail to produce rice and other grain.[*] But the
report of Baron von Mueller, when he has classified the botanical specimens,
will be an invaluable proof of the nature of the soil and its probable value
for future plantations.</p>
<blockquote>[* Good sugar country.]</blockquote>
<p>I also expect some valuable timber will be found among the forty specimens
that we have brought back, and which as yet are not classified. I look upon the
botanical collection as perhaps the most valuable work done on the
Expedition.</p>
<p>On Monday, 28th, about 10 a.m., we commenced our return, collecting a few
ethnological specimens on the way down, and arrived safely at Bonito Depot,
Observatory Bend, on the night of 29th, and found all well there. I intended to
have ascended the river again, but the health of the party would not allow it,
most of the river party being laid up after our return. That circumstance,
together with the dangerous position of the vessel, decided me to do all that
was possible in the way of collecting until the water rose, and then to
commence our return journey, stopping and giving as much time to the collectors
as circumstances would permit. Keeping in mind my instructions, and the
necessity of catching the steamer leaving Thursday Island November 21st. This I
adhered to; and as time and space does not permit me to detail our homeward
journey, I will briefly state that we left Observatory Bend, October 25th,
leaving one Malay buried there, and the health of the party far from good at
that time, safely journeying down the Strickland River with a few adventures-,
meeting far more natives than we had supposed lived on the river.</p>
<p>On one occasion, in a thickly populated place, which I estimate contained
2,000 natives, what threatened to be a serious tragedy was turned into a comedy
by our blowing the Syren whistle, which on that occasion certainly saved the
lives of a great number of natives and perhaps of some of our own party; but
proceeding, we left Strickland Junction, November 9th, Sumarti, November l0th,
Mouth of the Fly, November 18th, and arrived at Thursday Island at 10.30 a.m.
on November 28th (up to time). On arrival there, finding a relief party had
gone to our assistance, on consulting with the lion. J. Douglas, we despatched
a lugger with Mr. Senior in charge to recall them. Mr. Senior earnestly
requested this duty might be allotted to him, which I did on the Doctor's
assurance that it would in all probability benefit his health, which was far
from good, and was not likely to stop or impede his recovery. It is only fair
to the rest of the party to say that there were plenty of other volunteers for
that service.</p>
<p>We left Thursday Island on November 21st, in tow of s.s. "Alexandra," and
arrived in Sydney on December 3rd, all well, and on behalf of the Exploratory
Party I beg to return our most hearty thanks for the very generous and cordial
reception we received from the Society and public, and also for the kind and
deep interest felt for us when we were supposed to be in trouble.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I also report that the Expedition was entirely dependent on
its own resources. I was scarcely able to supplement our provisions at all,
game of all kinds being very scarce, and extremely shy. It was from first to
last conducted on temperance principle, no stimulants being taken as stores
excepting as medical comforts. I hold the opinion that any hard work can be
performed just as well without alcohol as with it.</p>
<p>Quinine was also taken by all the party daily from the time we left Thursday
Island until we returned there, but even that did not prevent our suffering
rather severely from fever, as four of the Europeans were dangerously ill, but
there is no doubt in my mind that it was extremely beneficial in staving off
malaria: and finally, in conducting the Expedition, I have endeavoured to
follow out my line of instruction as well as I could, and to keep in mind the
duty I owed to this Society, the members of the Expedition, and the natives of
the country we were sent to explore, and can at least congratulate myself that
no serious complication with the natives arose at all, and I think other
parties that may follow in our footsteps will benefit from any communications
we had with the native tribes.<br>
<br></p>
<p>Captain Everill was heartily cheered at the conclusion of his address, and
His Excellency the Chairman invited discussion.</p>
<p>Mr. Mann said that, after having carefully examined the map, and having
listened to the leader's remarks, he was inclined to think that the country
which had been traversed was a series of deltas or islands. Possibly, also, the
Aird River might unite with the Strickland. It was very probable that future
explorations would bear out this idea.</p>
<p>Dr. Belgrave thought that Captain Everill might well be congratulated upon
the success of the expedition. (Hear, hear.) He was only away some four months,
and about three thousand specimens were collected, in addition to exploration
work and its attendant risks. He had discovered, amongst other things, most
valuable and extensive cedar forests, and also a site for what might prove a
city, from whence the interior of the island might be explored. The expedition
was a success, and it well repaid the money and the labour which had been
expended, and ho heartily congratulated the leader and his party. It would be,
in his (Dr. Belgrave's) opinion, a mistake to continue sending expeditions, and
he advocated the formation of settlements. (Hear, hear.) Some central
settlement could be made, for instance, not far from the junction of the
Strickland and the Fly Rivers. He would like to be informed whether any
communication had been received from Mr. Stockdulo with reference to an
expedition.</p>
<p>Sir Edward Strickland said that he had recently received a communication
from that gentleman, but he had not yet perused it, and until he had done so no
answer could be given.</p>
<p>Mr. Thompson, the Secretary of the Queensland Branch of the Society thought
that thanks were due to Captain Everill, for many reasons; not the least of
which was the establishment of friendly relationships with the natives, and the
saving of white men's lives. He disagreed with Dr. Belgrave, and believed that
the time was not yet ripe for the establishment of a central depot. The Society
and the public now had an idea of what was really required to explore a
tropical country like Now Guinea, and the knowledge would be of extreme benefit
in future. He suggested that in succeeding expeditions there should be fewer
Europeans and more Malays. When discontent commenced in a party it was like a
cancer, and ate its way into the heart of the enterprise. He felt certain that
the world in general would hereafter thank Captain Everill and those who had
formed the expedition. (Cheers.) He had much pleasure in moving that the
Society's hearty thanks be accorded to them.</p>
<p>Mr. Du Faue seconded the proposition, and it was carried unanimously.</p>
<p>Sir Edward Strickland, on behalf of the members of the Society, then
presented Captain Everill with an illuminated address, which had been signed by
the various officers, and was inscribed to the leader and the members of the
party. Ho briefly alluded to the value of geographical research, and highly
eulogized the efforts of the explorers. Ho expressed the hope that the
expedition would be supplemented by others, and that the public would benefit
greatly thereby. The present one had shown how future trips might be carried
out more economically. Ho looked upon the work as a very gallant one (Lord
Carrington: Hear, hear), and he hoped that one and till would join in
congratulating Captain Everill and his comrades upon having done their duty to
their country and to those who had employed them. (Cheers.)</p>
<p>Captain Everill cordially acknowledged the gift, and he referred to the
sincere feelings of thankfulness which he and each of his party had
experienced, and had expressed, for the assistance which had been offered upon
the occasion of the rumour of their massacre. He quoted from a letter from the
Hon. John Douglas, in which an absolute denial was given to a rumour, that had
emanated from Cooktown, to the effect that ingratitude had been shown.</p>
<p>Sir E. Strickland, as the President of the Society, made a few remarks with
respect to the advantages of geographical knowledge; and he suggested the
advisability of efforts being made to obtain copies of apparatus, &amp;c.,
similar to that which was exhibited in London in connection with the study of
this branch of knowledge. He felt satisfied that the Government would not
ignore an appeal if it were made to them for assistance in this respect. (Hear,
hear.)</p>
<p>A vote of thanks was unanimously accorded to His Excellency for having
presided, and the proceedings were terminated about 6 p.m.</p>
<h2><a name="app-3" id="app-3"></a>APPENDIX III. GERMAN NEW GUINEA
EXPLORATIONS.</h2>
<h3>(Brisbane Daily Observer, September 17th, 1886.)</h3>
<p>Mr. Knappe, German Consul at Samoa, was a passenger by the "Alexandra," for
Sydney yesterday, after making an official tour in the German territories of
the Pacific. In the course of a conversation with a representative of this
journal on board the steamer, he stated that, acting under instructions from
the Imperial Government, ho left Samoa in June last, and was transported by the
flagship of the German squadron, the "Bismarck," to New Britain and the
Marshall Group, where he consulted the leading German traders with reference to
important matters relating to the government of those islands, and the better
organisation of the group.</p>
<p>After spending a few weeks among the various islands Dr. Knappe arrived at
Finschhafen, and at once accompanied a scientific expedition in the "Ottilio"
up the Empress Augusta River, which empties into the sea some hundreds of miles
from Finschhaven. He describes it as a magnificent stream, varying in width
from one to two miles. There is no bar, and the "Ottilie" steamed up it a
distance of 310 miles. The party then took the steam launch and navigated the
river for another ninety miles. At the furthest point reached they were
fifty-three miles from the Dutch boundary on the west, and sixty-three miles
from the British boundary on the south. The river for the whole of the way up
varied in depth from ten to fifteen fathoms. For the first 250 miles the
country was fertile, with portions liable to inundation; not far back on the
right hand side, however, a range of mountains towered aloft. The river had
previously been explored by Captain Dahhnann in the Samoa, for a distance of
fifty miles, and after his point of exploration was passed, landings were made
daily to observe the quality of the country, and to propitiate the natives who
assembled in large numbers on the banks. Dr. Knappe's account of these savages
is very interesting. He states that they were quite overcome on beholding the
"Ottilio," and pointing reverentially to the sun (whom Dr. Knappe believes they
worship) they foil at the feet of the explorers, as much as to
say&mdash;"Children of the Sun we worship you." They are a powerful and
apparently a contented race.</p>
<p>Although every few miles the language was different, the mode of life and
habits were similar. The largest village or plantation met with was about 240
miles up the river. It was situated some distance from the river, and contained
from fifteen to twenty large houses at some distance from each other, and built
at a height of about twelve feet from the ground on piles. Each house is very
solidly built, large beams being used in the framework, which is covered by a
thick thatch of grass. A peculiar custom obtains with reference to the
separation of the sexes, the males and females occupying different houses. Each
house or ward has accommodation for about fifty. The male children, up to the
age of about thirteen years, inhabit the female wards. Owing to the brief stay
and ignorance of the language. Dr. Knappe says he was unable to ascertain what
are their customs with regard to marriage. As in other portions of New Guinea,
the natives go in for extensive plantations, their special products being yams
and other tubers, of which Dr. Knappe possessed no knowledge. Sago palms,
bananas, and cocoa-nut trees also were growing wild in profusion. The favourite
kind of ornamentation indulged in in the men's huts were rows of grinning
skulls, in which the human and the crocodile were awarded the place of honour,
the skulls of the dogs and pigs that surrounded them evidently not being held
in such high reverence. The natives are not by any means vegetarians, deriving
their supply of flesh from the hordes of dogs and pigs which surround their
villages. They have also a kind of fowl, but Dr. Knappe did not observe at any
of the feasts at which he was present that poultry was provided. Their bows,
arrows, and spears are not nearly so well-made or so formidable as those of the
coastal natives, and their canoes are nothing but trees hollowed out, first by
chopping with their inferior stone axes, and then by fire. Dr. Knappe said that
in one he counted twenty-two occupants. No out-riggers or rowlocks are used,
the canoe being propelled by paddles, which are used by the rowers standing
up.</p>
<p>The natives, both men and women, are inveterate smokers of cigarettes, which
they manufacture from the tobacco leaf, which is indigenous. The tobacco leaf
is rolled tightly up, and enclosed in the green leaf of a pepper tree. Dr.
Knappe smoked one himself and found that though a decided novelty, it was not
all unpleasant. Another custom is betel-nut chewing. They chew the nut, then
place the end of a small stick in their mouth. The moistened part is then
dipped in lime and again transferred to the mouth. Dr. Knappe was urgently
invited to participate, but not having a cast-iron tongue, declined the
request. The costume of the natives is rather primitive. The men go about
entirely nude and the skirt worn by the women is remarkably scanty. Iron, which
is generally so highly prized by savages, found no favour in the eyes of the
natives there, but turkey red had not lost its power to charm, and the native
that secured an empty bottle was an object of the greatest envy to his fellows.
The prize was at once filled with lime and surrounded by betel-nut-chewers who
in ecstasy dipped their lime-sticks in it and were happy. During the trip many
geological specimens were obtained, including quartz, but as Dr. Knappe
confessed that he was entirely ignorant of such matters ho was unable to state
whether the country was likely to be auriferous.</p>
<p>After a very pleasant and instructive trip of three weeks the party again
reached the sea, and on their way to Finschhaven inspected the stations at
Feldthaven and Hatsfeldt Harbour. Both were found to be flourishing, especially
the latter, which had experienced entire immunity from sickness for the past
six months. Dr. Knappe spent a few weeks at Finschhaven as the guest of the
Governor, Baron Schleintz, and expresses his belief that there is a great
future before CJcrman New Guinea. The German New Guinea Company have been so
far most fortunate. They have had no trouble to speak of with the natives, over
100 of whom, men and women, they have now working for them, the solo payment in
return being an occasional donation of turkey red, scrap iron, or beads. The
Malays, too, are working well, but, as is almost invariably the case, have to
be ruled with a firm hand. It is intended by the Company to establish stations
all along the magnificent stream opened up by Dr. Knappe and his companions,
and in order to do so speedily an officer of the Company, Mr. Graboffski,
accompanied Dr. Knappe to Cooktown, where he is now waiting the arrival of a
British-India steamer. He will then proceed to Batavia, and engage 150 more
Malays for this Company, who will employ them on the new plantations.</p>
<p>The outlay of the Company up to the present has been considerable, without
taking into consideration the loss of the Papua, but Dr. Knappe is of opinion
that the privileges they have obtained will be of enormous value in the future.
By their charter they have possession of all land not actually claimed by
others, and as the natives do not care a rush for the land not comprised in
their plantations the company practically own all the German territory. He also
believes that the foundations of a prosperous colony have already been laid.
Fortunately for Dr. Knappe, the "Ottilio" arrived at Cooktown just in time to
catch the "Alexandra," which steamer will roach Sydney next Monday. Dr. Knappe
the next day transships into the Lubock, which steamer will land him at Samoa
in time to form one of the Commission recently appointed by the British and
German Governments to inquire into matters concerning the islands at present
under his especial charge.</p>
