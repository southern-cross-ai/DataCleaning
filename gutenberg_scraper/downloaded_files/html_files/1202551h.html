<h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="pref" name="pref">PREFACE</a></h2>
<p class="intro">IT is continually stated that it is impossible to bring out at
the present time any accurate history of the war. No doubt this is true so far
as some points of the larger strategy are concerned, for the motives at the
back of them have not yet been cleared up. It is true also as regards many
incidents which have exercised the minds of statesmen and of many possibilities
which have worried the soldiers. But so far as the actual early events of our
own campaign upon the Continent are concerned there is no reason why the
approximate truth should not now be collected and set forth. I believe that the
narrative in this volume will in the main stand the test of time, and that the
changes of the future will consist of additions rather than of alterations or
subtractions.</p>
<p class="intro">The present volume deals only with the events of 1914 in the
British fighting-line in France and Belgium. A second volume dealing with 1915
will be published within a few months. It is intended that a third volume,
covering the current year, shall carry on this contemporary narrative of a
tremendous episode.</p>
<p class="intro">From the first days of the war I have devoted much of my time
to the accumulation of evidence from first-hand sources as to the various
happenings of these great days. I have built up my narrative from letters,
diaries, and interviews from the hand or lips of men who have been soldiers in
our armies, the deeds of which it was my ambition to understand and to
chronicle. In many cases I have been privileged to submit my descriptions of
the principal incidents to prominent actors in them, and to receive their
corrections or endorsement. I can say with certainty, therefore, that a great
deal of this work is not only accurate, but that it is very precisely correct
in its detail. The necessary restrictions which forbade the mention of numbered
units have now been removed, a change made possible by the very general
rearrangements which have recently taken place. I am able, therefore, to deal
freely with my material. As that material is not always equally full, it may
have occasionally led to a want of proportion, where the brigade occupies a
line and the battalion a paragraph. In extenuation of such faults, and of the
omissions which are unavoidable, I can only plead the difficulty of the task
and throw myself upon the reader's good nature. Some compensation for such
shortcoming may be found in the fact that a narrative written at the time
reflects the warm emotions which these events aroused amongst us more clearly
than the more measured story of the future historian can do.</p>
<p class="intro">It may seem that the political chapters are somewhat long for
a military work, but the reader will find that in subsequent volumes there are
no further politics, so that this survey of the European conditions of 1914 is
a lead up to the whole long narrative of the actual contest.</p>
<p class="intro">I would thank my innumerable correspondents (whom I may not
name) for their very great help. I would also admit the profit which I have
derived from reading Coleman's <i>Mons To Ypres</i>, and especially Lord Ernest
Hamilton's <i>The First Seven Divisions</i>. These books added some new facts,
and enabled me to check many old ones. Finally, I desire to thank my friend Mr.
P.L. Forbes for his kind and intelligent assistance in arranging my
material.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="chap1" name="chap1">I. THE
BREAKING OF THE PEACE</a></h2>
<p class="first">IN the frank, cynical, and powerful book* of General Bernhardi
which has been so often quoted in connection with the war there is one
statement which is both true and important. It is, that no one in Great
Britain thought seriously of a war with Germany before the year 1902. As a
German observer he has fixed this date, and a British commentator who cast back
through the history of the past would surely endorse it. Here, then, is a point
of common agreement from which one can construct a scheme of thought.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* <i>Deutschland und der n&auml;chste Krieg</i> (Germany
And The Next War), Cotta Verlag, Stuttgart 1912. ]</p>
<p>Why then should the British people in the year 1902 begin to seriously
contemplate the possibility of a war with Germany? It might be argued by a
German apologist that this date marks an appreciation by Great Britain that
Germany was a great trade rival who might with advantage be crushed. But the
facts would not sustain such a conclusion. The growth of German trade and of
German wealth was a phenomenon with which the British were familiar. It had
been constant since the days when Bismarck changed the policy of his country
from free trade to protection, and it had competed for twenty years without the
idea of war having entered British minds. On the contrary, the prevailing
economic philosophy in Great Britain was, that trade reacts upon trade, and
that the successful rival becomes always the best customer. It is true that
manufacturers expressed occasional irritation at the methods of German
commerce, such as the imitation of British trade-marks and shoddy reproductions
of British products. The Fatherland can produce both the best and the worst,
and the latter either undersold us or forced down our own standards. But apart
from this natural annoyance, the growing trade of Germany produced no hostility
in Great Britain which could conceivably have led to an armed conflict. Up to
the year 1896 there was a great deal of sympathy and of respect in Great
Britain for the German Empire. It was felt that of all Continental Powers she
was the one which was most nearly allied to Britain in blood, religion, and
character. The fact that in 1890 Lord Salisbury deliberately handed over to
Germany Heligoland&mdash;an island which blockaded her chief commercial port
and the harbour of her warships &mdash;must show once for all how entirely
Germany lay outside of any possible world-struggle which could at that time be
foreseen. France has always had its warm partisans in this country, but none
the less it can most truthfully be said that during all the years that Britain
remained in political isolation she would, had she been forced to take sides,
have assuredly chosen to stand by the Triple Alliance. It is hard now to recall
those days of French pinpricks and of the evil effects which they produced.
Germany's foreign policy is her own affair, and the German people are the
judges of those who control it, but to us it must appear absolutely demented in
taking a line which has driven this great world-power away from her side
&mdash;or, putting it at its lowest, away from an absolute neutrality, and into
the ranks of her enemies.</p>
<p>In 1896 there came the first serious chill in the relations between the two
countries. It arose from the famous telegram to Kruger at the time of the
Jameson Raid&mdash;a telegram which bore the name of the Kaiser, but which is
understood to have been drafted by Baron Marschall von Bieberstein. Whoever was
responsible for it did his country a poor service, for British feelings were
deeply hurt at such an intrusion into a matter which bore no direct relation to
Germany. Britons had put themselves thoroughly in the wrong. Britain admitted
and deplored it. Public opinion was the more sensitive to outside interference,
and the telegram of congratulation from the Emperor to Kruger was felt to be an
uncalled-for impertinence. The matter passed, however, and would have been
forgiven and forgotten but for the virulent agitation conducted against us in
Germany during the Boer War &mdash;an agitation which, it is only fair to say,
appeared to receive no support from the Kaiser himself, who twice visited
England during the course of the struggle. It could not be forgotten, however,
that Von B&uuml;low, the Chancellor, assumed an offensive attitude in some of
his speeches, that the very idea of an Anglo-German Alliance put forward by
Chamberlain in 1900 was scouted by the German Press, and that in the whole
country there was hardly a paper which did not join in a chorus of unreasoned
hatred and calumny against ourselves, our policy, and our arms. The incident
was a perfectly astounding revelation to the British, who looked back at the
alliance between the two countries, and had imagined that the traditions of
such battles as Minden or Dettingen, where British blood had been freely shed
in Prussia's quarrel, really stood for something in their present relations.
Britons were absolutely unconscious of anything which had occurred to alter the
bonds which history had formed. It was clear, once for all, that this was mere
self-deception, and as the British are a practical race, who are more concerned
with what is than why it is, they resigned themselves to the situation and
adjusted their thoughts to this new phase of their relations.</p>
<p>But soon a new phenomenon engaged their attention. They had already realised
that the Germans, for some motive which appeared to them to be entirely
inadequate, were filled with hatred, and would do the British Empire an injury
if they had the power. Hitherto, they had never had the power. But now it was
evident that they were forging a weapon which might enable them to gratify
their malevolence. In 1900 was passed the famous German law regulating the
increase of their navy. The British, preoccupied by their South African War,
took no great notice of it at the time, but from 1902 onwards it engaged their
attention to an ever-increasing degree. The original law was ambitious and
far-reaching, but it was subjected to several modifications, each of which made
it more formidable. By a system as inexorable as Fate, year after year added to
the force which was being prepared at Wilhelmshaven and at Kiel&mdash;a force
entirely out of proportion to the amount of German commerce to be defended or
of German coast-line to be protected. The greatest army in the world was
rapidly being supplemented by a fleet which would be dangerously near, both in
numbers and quality, to our own. The British Admiralty, more influenced by
party politics than the German, showed at times commendable activity, and at
other periods inexcusable indifference. On the whole, it was well ahead in its
building programmes, for a wide circle of the public had become thoroughly
awakened to the danger, and kept up a continual and most justifiable agitation
for a broader margin of safety. Fortunately, the two final rulers of the Navy
&mdash;McKenna and Churchill&mdash;rose to their responsibilities, and, in
spite of a clamour from a section of their own party, insisted upon an adequate
preponderance of naval construction. A deep debt of gratitude is owed also to
the action of Lord Fisher, who saw the danger afar off and used all his
remarkable powers of organisation and initiative to ensure that his country
should be ready for the approaching struggle.</p>
<p>Great Britain, being much exercised in mind by the menacing tone of Germany,
expressed not only in her great and rapid naval preparations, but in an
astonishing outburst of minatory speeches and literature from professors,
journalists, and other leaders of the people, began from 1902 onwards to look
round her for allies. Had she continued to remain isolated, some turn of the
political wheel might have exposed her to a Continental coalition under the
leadership and inspiration of this bitter enemy. But for the threats of
Germany, Britain would in all probability have been able to keep aloof from
entanglements, but as it was, the enemies of her enemy became of necessity her
friends. In an attempt to preserve her independence of action so far as was
still possible, she refused to form an alliance, and only committed herself in
a vague fashion to an ill-defined <i>entente</i>. By settling several
outstanding causes of friction with The France, an agreement was come to in the
year 1903 which was extended to Russia in 1907. The general purport of such an
arrangement was, that the sympathies of Great Britain were with the Dual
Alliance, and that these sympathies would be translated into action if events
seemed to warrant it. An aggressive policy on the part of France or Russia
would be absolutely discountenanced by Britain, but if France were attacked
Britain would pledge herself to do her utmost to prevent her from being
overwhelmed. It was recognised that a victorious Germany would constitute a
serious menace to the British Empire&mdash;a fact which neither the Pan-German
fanatics nor the German national Press would ever permit us to forget. In this
policy of insuring against a German attack King Edward VII. took a deep
interest, and the policy is itself attributed to him in Germany, but as a
matter of fact it represented the only sane course of action which was open to
the nation. Germans are fond of representing King Edward's action as the cause
of subsequent events, whereas a wider knowledge would show them that it was
really the effect of five years of German irritation and menace. This, then,
was the political situation up to the time of the actual outbreak of war. Upon
the one side were the German and Austrian Empires in a solid alliance, while
Italy was nominally allied, but obviously moved upon an orbit of her own. On
the other hand, Russia and France were solidly allied, with Britain moving upon
an independent orbit which had more relation with that of her friends than
Italy's with that of Central Europe. It might clearly have been foreseen that
Britain's fate would be that of France, while Italy would break away under any
severe test, for a number of open questions divided her vitally from her
secular enemy to the north-east, The whole story of the campaign of Tripoli in
1911 showed very clearly how independent, and even antagonistic, were the
interests and actions of Italy.</p>
<p>Germany, in the meanwhile, viewed with considerable annoyance the formation
of the elastic but very real ties which united France and Britain, while she
did not cease to continue the course of action which had encouraged them. It
had been one of the axioms of Wilhelmstrasse that whilst the British occupied
Egypt, no friendship was possible between them and the French. Even now they
were incredulous that such a thing could be, and they subjected it to a
succession of tests. They desired to see whether the friendship was a reality,
or whether it was only for fair-weather use and would fly to pieces before the
stress of storm. Twice they tried it, once in 1905 when they drove France into
a conference at Algeciras, and again in 1911, when in a time of profound peace
they stirred up trouble by sending a gunboat to Agadir in south-western
Morocco, an event which brought Europe to the very edge of war. In each case
the <i>entente</i> remained so close and firm that it is difficult to imagine
that they were really surprised by our actions in 1914, when the enormous
provocation of the breach of the Belgian treaty was added to our promise to
stand by France in any trouble not of her own making.</p>
<p>Allusion has been made to the campaign of threats and abuse which had been
going on for many years in Germany, but the matter is of such importance in its
bearing upon the outbreak of war that it requires&mdash;some fuller discussion.
For a long period before matters became acute between the two countries, a
number of writers, of whom Nietzsche and Treitschke are the best known, had
inoculated the German spirit with a most mischievous philosophy, which grew the
more rapidly as it was dropped into the favourable soil of Prussian militarism.
Nietzsche's doctrines were a mere general defence of might as against right,
and of violent brutality against everything which we associate with
Christianity and Civilisation. The whooping savage bulked larger in this
perverted philosophy than the saint or the martyr. His views, however, though
congenial to a certain class of the German people, had no special international
significance. The typical brute whom he exalted was blonde, but a brute of any
other tint would presumably suffice. It was different in the case of
Treitschke. He was a historian, not a philosopher, with nothing indefinite or
abstract about his teaching. He used his high position as Professor in the
Berlin University to preach the most ardent Chauvinism, and above all to teach
the rising generation of Germans that their special task was to have a
reckoning with England and to destroy the British Empire, which for some reason
he imagined to be degenerate and corrupt. He has passed away before he could
see the ruin which he helped to bring about, for there is no doubt that his
deeds lived after him, and that he is one of half a dozen men who were
prominent in guiding their country along the path which has ended in the abyss.
Scores of other lesser writers repeated and exaggerated his message. Prominent
among these was General von Bernhardi, a man of high standing and a very great
authority upon theoretical warfare. In the volume on <i>Germany And The Next
War</i>, which has been already quoted, he declared in the year 1911 that
Germany should and would do exactly what it has done in 1914. Her antagonists,
her allies, and her general strategy are all set forth with a precision which
shows that German thinkers had entirely made up their minds as to the course of
events, and that the particular pretext upon which war would be waged was a
matter of secondary importance. These and similar sentiments naturally
increased the uneasiness and resentment in Great Britain, where the taxation
had risen constantly in the endeavour to keep pace with German preparations,
until it was generally felt that such a state of things could not continue
without some crisis being reached. The cloud was so heavy that it must either
pass or burst.</p>
<p>The situation had been aggravated by the fact that in order to win popular
assent to the various increases of the naval estimates in Germany, constantly
recurring anti-British agitations were deliberately raised with alarms of an
impending attack. As Britain had never thought of attacking Germany during the
long years when she had been almost defenceless at sea, it was difficult to
perceive why she should do so now; but none the less the public and the
politicians were gulled again and again by this device, which, while it
achieved its purpose of obtaining the money, produced a corresponding
resentment in Great Britain. Sometimes these manoeuvres to excite public
opinion in favour of an increased navy went to extreme lengths which might well
have justified an official remonstrance from England. A flagrant example was
the arrest, trial, and condemnation of Captain Stewart for espionage upon the
evidence of a suborned and perjured criminal. It is a story which is little to
the credit of the Imperial Government, of the High Court at Leipzig, or of the
British authorities who failed to protect their fellow-countryman from most
outrageous treatment.</p>
<p>So much for the causes which helped to produce an evil atmosphere between
the two countries. Looking at the matter from the German point of view, there
were some root-causes out of which this monstrous growth had come, and it is
only fair that these should be acknowledged and recorded. These causes can all
be traced to the fact that Britain stood between Germany and that world-empire
of which she dreamed. This depended upon circumstances over which this country
had no control, and which she could not modify if she had wished to do so.
Britain, through her maritime power and through the energy of her merchants,
had become a great world-power when Germany was still a collection of petty
States. When Germany became a powerful Empire with a rising population and an
immense commerce, she found that the choice places of the world, and those most
fitted for the spread of a transplanted European race, were already filled up.
It was not a matter which Britain could help, nor could she alter it, since
Canada, Australasia, and South Africa would not, even if she had desired it, be
transferred to German rule. And yet it formed a national grievance, and if we
can put ourselves in the place of the Germans we may admit that it was galling
that the surplus of their manhood should go to build up the strength of an
alien and possibly a hostile State. To this point we could fully see that
grievance&mdash;or rather that misfortune, since no one was in truth to blame
in the matter. It was forgotten by their people that the Colonial Empire of the
British and of the French had been built up by much outlay of blood and
treasure, extending over three centuries. Germany had existed as a united State
for less than half a century, and already during that time had built up a very
considerable oversea dominion. It was unreasonable to suppose that she could at
once attain the same position as her fully grown rivals.</p>
<p>Thus this German discontent was based upon fixed factors which could no more
be changed by Britain than the geographical position which has laid her right
across the German exit to the oceans of the world. That this deeply rooted
national sentiment, which for ever regarded Britain as the Carthage to which
they were destined to play the part of Rome, would sooner or later have brought
about war, is beyond all doubt. There are a score of considerations which show
that a European war had long been planned, and that finally the very date,
determined by the completion of the broadened Kiel Canal, had been
approximately fixed. The importations of corn, the secret preparations of giant
guns, the formations of concrete gun-platforms, the early distribution of
mobilisation papers, the sending out of guns for auxiliary cruisers, the arming
of the German colonies, all point to a predetermined rupture. If it could not
be effected on one pretext, it certainly would on another. As a matter of fact,
an occasion was furnished by means which have not yet been fully cleared up. It
was one which admirably suited the German book, since it enabled her to make
her ally the apparent protagonist and so secure her fidelity to the bond. At
the same time, by making the cause of quarrel one which affected only the
Slavonic races, she hoped to discourage and detach the more liberal of the
Western Powers and so divide the ranks of the Allies from the outset. It is
possible, though not certain, that she might have effected this in the case of
Great Britain, but for her own stupendous blunder in the infraction of Belgian
neutrality, which left us a united nation in our agreement as to the necessity
of war.</p>
<p>The political balance of the Great Powers of Europe is so delicately
adjusted that any weakening of one means a general oscillation of all. The
losses of Russia in a sterile campaign in East Asia in 1904 disturbed the whole
peace of the world. Germany took advantage of it at once to bully France over
Morocco; and in 1908, judging correctly that Russia was still unfit for war,
Austria, with the connivance and help of Germany, tore up the Treaty of Berlin
without reference to its other signatories, and annexed the provinces of Bosnia
and Herzegovina. Russia immediately issued a futile protest, as did Great
Britain, but the latter had no material interest at stake. It was otherwise
with Russia. She was the hereditary guardian of Slav interests which were
directly attacked by this incorporation of an unwilling Slav population into
the Austrian Empire. Unable for the moment to prevent it, she waited in silent
wrath for the chance of the future, humiliated and exasperated by the knowledge
that she had been bullied at the moment of her temporary weakness. So great had
been the indignity that it was evident that were she to tolerate a second one
it would mean the complete abandonment of her leadership of the race. On June
28, 1914, the Archduke Francis Ferdinand, heir to the throne of the Austrian
Empire, made a state visit to Sarajevo in the newly annexed provinces. Here he
was assassinated, together with his wife. The immediate criminals were two
youths named Princip and Cabrinovic, but what exact forces were at the back of
them, or whether they merely represented local discontent, have never yet been
clearly shown. Austria was, however, naturally incensed against Serbia, which
was looked upon as the centre of all aggressive Slavonic action. Politics take
fantastic shapes in this south-eastern corner of Europe, and murder, abduction,
forgery, and perjury are weapons which in the past have been freely used by all
parties. The provocation in this instance was so immense and the crime so
monstrous that had it been established after trustworthy examination that
Serbia had indeed been directly connected with it, there is no doubt that the
whole of Europe, including Russia, would have acquiesced in any reasonable
punishment which could be inflicted. Certainly the public opinion of Great
Britain would have been unanimous in keeping clear of any quarrel which seemed
to uphold the criminals.</p>
<p>Austria seems to have instantly made up her mind to push the matter to an
extreme conclusion, as is shown by the fact that mobilisation papers were
received by Austrians abroad, bearing the date June 30, so that they were
issued within two days of the crime. An inquiry was held in connection with the
trial of the assassins, which was reported to have implicated individual
Serbians in the murder plot, but no charge was made against the Serbian
Government. Had Austria now demanded the immediate trial and punishment of
these accomplices, she would once again have had the sympathy of the civilised
world. Her actual action was far more drastic, and gave impartial observers the
conviction that she was endeavouring not to obtain reparation but to ensure
war. It is inconceivable that so important a document as her ultimatum was
launched without the approval of Berlin, and we have already seen that Germany
was in a mood for war. The German newspapers, even before the Austrian demands
were made, had begun to insist that in view of the distracted domestic politics
of Great Britain, and of the declaration by M. Humbert in the French Senate
that the army was unprepared, the hour for definite settlements had
arrived.</p>
<p>The Austrian ultimatum was such a demand as one nation has never yet
addressed to another. Indeed, it could hardly be said that Serbia would remain
a nation if she submitted to it. Some clauses, though severe, were within the
bounds of reason. That papers should not be allowed to incite hatred, and that
secret societies which were supposed to be connected with the crime should be
forcibly suppressed, were not unfair demands. So, too, that all accessories to
the plot, some of whom are mentioned by name, should be tried, and that certain
measures to prevent a possible recurrence of such plots should be adopted. All
these demands might be justified, and each of them was, as a matter of fact,
accepted by Serbia. The impossible conditions were that Austrian judges should
sit in Serbia upon political cases and that delegates of Austria should have
partial administrative control in the neighbouring kingdom. Even these
outrageous demands were not rejected absolutely by the Serbian Government,
though it proclaimed itself to be unable to accept them in the crude form in
which they were presented. A humble and conciliatory reply concluded with an
expression of the desire to submit any point still open to impartial of the
arbitration. The Austrian Government&mdash;or the forces behind
it&mdash;appeared, however, to have no desire at all to find a peaceful
solution. So precipitate were they in their action, that on the receipt of the
Serbian reply, in less than an hour the Austrian Minister had left Belgrade,
and a diplomatic rupture, the immediate prelude to war, had taken place between
the two countries. So far only two figures were on the stage, but already vast
shadows were looming in the wings, and all the world was hushed at the
presentiment of coming tragedy.</p>
<p>It has been shown that Russia, the elder brother of the Slav races, had once
already been humiliated over Austrian policy and could not be indifferent to
this new attempt to coerce a Slavonic people. The King of Serbia in his sore
need appealed to the Czar and received a sympathetic reply. A moderate
castigation of Serbia might have been condoned by Russia, but she could not
contemplate unmoved a course of action which would practically destroy a
kindred State. The Austrian army was already mobilising, so Russia also began
to mobilise in the south. Events crowded rapidly upon each other. On July 28
came the declaration of war from Austria to Serbia. Three days later&mdash;days
which were employed by Great Britain in making every possible effort to prevent
the extension of the mischief &mdash;Germany as Austria's ally declared war
upon Russia. Two days later Germany declared war upon France. The current ran
swiftly as it drew nearer to Niagara.</p>
<p>The scope of this chronicle is more immediately concerned with the doings of
Great Britain in this sudden and frightful misfortune which had fallen upon
Europe. Her peaceful efforts were thrust aside, for she was dealing with those
who had predetermined that there should be no peace. Even Austria, the prime
mover in discord, had shown herself inclined to treat at the last moment, but
Germany had hastened her onwards by a sudden ultimatum to Russia. From that
instant the die was cast. The attitude of France was never in doubt. She was
taken at a disadvantage, for her President was abroad when the crisis broke
out, but the most chivalrous of nations could be relied upon to fulfil her
obligations. She took her stand at once by the side of her ally. The one
all-important question upon which the history of the world would depend, as so
often before, was the action of Great Britain.</p>
<p>Sir Edward Grey had proposed a conference of ambassadors to deal with the
situation, a suggestion which was set aside by Germany. So long as the matter
was purely Balkan it was outside the sphere of special British interests, but
day by day it was becoming more clear that France would be involved, and a
large party in Great Britain held that it would be impossible for us to stand
by and witness any further dismembering of our neighbour. Thus the shadow which
had settled so heavily upon the south-east of Europe was creeping across from
east to west until it was already darkening the future of Britain. It was
obviously the German game, whatever her ultimate designs might be upon the
British Empire, to endeavour to keep it peaceful until she had disposed of her
Continental opponents. For this reason a strong bid was made for British
neutrality upon July 29, through the Ambassador at Berlin, Sir Edward Goschen.
In an official conversation German Chancellor, Bethmann-Hollweg, declared that
of the Germany was ready to pledge herself to take no territory from France in
case of victory. He would make no promise as regards the French colonies, nor
was anything said as to the French Fleet, nor as to the gigantic indemnity
which was already discussed in some of the German papers. In a word, the
proposition was that Great Britain was to abandon her friend at the hour of her
need on condition that she should be robbed but not mutilated. Subsequent
experience of German promises may lead us to doubt, however, whether they would
really have insured France against the worst that the victor could inflict.</p>
<p>Sir Edward Grey answered with as much warmth as the iced language of
diplomacy will permit. His dispatch of July 30 begins as follows:</p>
<p>"His Majesty's Government cannot for a moment entertain the Chancellor's
proposal that they should bind themselves to neutrality on such terms.</p>
<p>"What he asks us in effect is, to engage to stand by while French colonies
are taken and France is beaten so long as Germany does not take French
territory as distinct from the colonies.</p>
<p>"From the material point of view such a proposal is unacceptable, for
France, without further territory in Europe being taken from her, could be so
crushed as to lose her position as a great Power, and become subordinate to
German policy.</p>
<p>"Altogether apart from that, it would be a disgrace for us to make this
bargain with Germany at the expense of France, a disgrace from which the, good
name of this country would never recover."</p>
<p>At a subsequent period the Premier, Mr. Asquith, voiced the sentiment of the
whole nation when he declared that the proposal was infamous.</p>
<p>The immediate concern of the British Government was to ascertain the views
of the rival Powers upon the question of Belgian neutrality, which had been
solemnly guaranteed by France, Prussia, and ourselves. How faithfully this
guarantee had been observed by France in the past is shown by the fact that
even when an infraction of the frontier at Sedan in 1870 would have saved the
French Army from total destruction, it had not been attempted. There were signs
in advance, however, that Germany proposed to turn the French defences by
marching through Belgium. The arrangement of the new German strategic railways
upon the frontier all pointed to such a plan. It was evident that such an
action must at once bring Britain into the struggle, since it is difficult to
see how she could ever hold up her head again if, after promising protection to
a smaller nation, she broke her bond at the moment of danger. The French, too,
who had left their northern frontier comparatively unfortified in reliance upon
the integrity of Belgium, would have rightly felt that they had been betrayed
by Britain if they suffered now through their confidence in the British
guarantee. The Balkans were nothing to Great Britain, but she had more than her
interests, she had her national honour at stake upon the Belgian frontier.</p>
<p>On July 31 the British Government asked France and Germany whether they were
still prepared to stand by their pledge. France answered promptly that she was,
and added that she had withdrawn her armies ten kilometres from the frontier,
so as to prove to the world that her position was defensive only. From Germany
there came an ominous silence. Meanwhile, in Brussels the German
representative, Herr von Below-Saleske, was assuring the Belgian Government
that nothing was further from the intention of Germany than an infraction of
the frontier. These assurances were continued almost to the moment of the
arrival of German troops in Belgium, and give one more instance of the absolute
want of truth and honour which from the days of Frederick the Great has been
the outstanding characteristic of German diplomacy. Just as the Seven Years'
War was begun by an attack upon an ally in times of peace, so her last two
campaigns have been opened, the one by the doctored telegram of Ems, and the
other by the perfidy to Belgium, which is none the less shameful because it has
been publicly admitted by the Chancellor.</p>
<p>Another incident of these crowded days deserves some record, as it has been
quoted in Germany as an instance of Great Britain having stood in the way of a
localisation of the war. This impression is produced by suppressing a telegram
in which it is shown that the whole episode arose from a mistake upon the part
of Prince Lichnowsky, the German Ambassador. On August 1 Sir Edward Grey, still
feeling round for some way in which the evil might be minimised, suggested
through the telephone to Prince Lichnowsky that if both Germany and France
could see their way to stand out, the conflict would then be limited to Austria
and Russia. This practical and possible suggestion was transmitted to Berlin in
the absurd form that Britain would hold France out of the war, while Russia
would be abandoned to Germany and Austria. The Kaiser lost no time in assenting
to so delightful a proposal. It was at once pointed out to Prince Lichnowsky
that he had made a mistake, and the Prince telegraphed to Berlin a correction
of his previous message. This second telegram was suppressed by the German
Government, while, some weeks afterwards, they published the inaccurate
dispatch in order to give the world the impression that Britain had actually
made a move towards peace which had been withdrawn when it was found that it
was eagerly welcomed by Germany. The very idea that Britain could in any way
pledge the actions of France is grotesque upon the face of it. Whilst making
this false suggestion as to the action of Britain, the German Government
carefully concealed the fact that Sir Edward Grey had actually gone the extreme
length in the interests of peace, of promising that we should detach ourselves
from our Allies if a conference were held and their unreasonable attitude was
an obstacle to an agreement.</p>
<p>Whether, if Belgian neutrality had been honoured, Great Britain would or
would not have come into the war is an academic question which can never be
decided. Certainly she would never have come in as a united nation, for public
opinion was deeply divided upon the point, and the Cabinet is understood to
have been at variance. Only one thing could have closed the ranks and sent the
British Empire with absolute unanimity into the fight. This was the one thing
which Germany did. However great her military power may be, it seems certain
that her diplomatic affairs were grievously mismanaged, and that, in spite of
that cloud of spies who have been the precursors of her Uhlans in each of her
campaigns, she was singularly ill-informed as to the sentiments of foreign
nations. The columns of a single honest British paper would have told her more
of the true views and spirit of the nation than all the eavesdroppers of her
famous secret service.</p>
<p>We now come to the critical instant as regards Britain, leading to a
succession of incidents in Berlin so admirably described in Sir Edward
Goschen's classical report that it seems a profanation to condense it. Having
received no reply to their request for a definite assurance about Belgium, the
British Government instructed their Ambassador to ask for an immediate answer
upon August 4. The startling reply from Von Jagow, Secretary of Foreign
Affairs, was that the German troops had actually crossed the frontier. With a
cynical frankness the German statesman explained that it was a matter of life
or death to the Imperial Army to get their blow in quickly by the undefended
route. In answer to the shocked remonstrance of the British Ambassador, he
could only assert that it was now too late to reconsider the matter. About
seven in the evening Sir Edward Goschen conveyed an ultimatum upon the subject
to the German Government, declaring war unless by midnight a more satisfactory
answer could be given.</p>
<p>From Herr von Jagow the Ambassador passed to the Chancellor, whom he found
much agitated. He broke into a harangue in which he used the phrase, now become
historic, that he could not understand the British Government making such a
fuss about a mere scrap of paper, and declared that a breach of territorial
neutrality was a matter of no great consequence. A recollection of the history
of his own country would none the less have reminded him that it was precisely
on account of an infringement of their frontier by the troops of Napoleon that
Prussia had entered upon the ill-fated war of 1806. He continued by saying that
he held Great Britain responsible for all the terrible events which might
happen. Sir Edward pointed out that it was a matter of necessity that Great
Britain should keep her engagements, and added with dignity that fear of the
consequences could hardly be accepted as a valid reason for breaking them.</p>
<p>Such in brief was the momentous interview which determined the question of
peace or war between these two great Empires. Sir Edward immediately forwarded
a telegraphic summary of what had occurred to London, but this telegram was
never forwarded by the Berlin authorities&mdash;one more of those actions for
which the word "caddish " is the most appropriate British adjective. Throughout
all our German experiences both before the war and during it, we have always
found our rivals to be formidable; they have usually proved themselves to be
both brave and energetic; but hardly ever have we recognised them as gentlemen.
Three centuries ago the leading nations of Europe had attained something subtle
and gracious which is still denied to the Germans.</p>
<p>The populace of Berlin hastened to show these same unamiable
characteristics. Whereas the retiring Ambassadors in London, Paris, and also in
Vienna, met with courteous treatment, the German mob surrounded the British
Embassy and hurled vituperations, and finally stones, at its occupants.
Defenceless people were hustled, assaulted, and arrested in the streets. A day
or two previously the Russian Embassy had been brutally insulted by the
populace of the upon its departure&mdash;a fact which produced some
regrettable, but very natural, reprisals in Petrograd, to use the new name for
the Russian capital. The French Ambassador and his suite had also been very
badly treated in their journey to the Dutch frontier. Thus it was shocking, but
not surprising, to find that the Berlin mob indulged in excesses towards the
British representatives, and that shameful scenes marked the final hours of Sir
Edward Goschen's official duties. Truly, as Herr von Jagow admitted, such
incidents leave an indelible stain upon the reputation of Berlin. It is
pleasant to be able to add that Von Jagow himself behaved with propriety, and
did what he could to mitigate the violence of the populace.</p>
<p>It is difficult for us to imagine how any German could possibly for an
instant have imagined that Great Britain would stand by in silent acquiescence
while the little country which she had sworn to protect was overrun by German
troops; but that such a delusion existed is shown not only by the consternation
of the Chancellor at Sir Edward's message, but also by the extreme irritation
of the Emperor. What part Emperor William had played in the events which led up
to the war may possibly remain for ever the subject of debate. There are those
who argue that the Crown Prince and the military party had taken advantage of
his absence on one of his Norwegian tours, and had hurried matters into such an
<i>impasse</i> that he was unable to get them back to more peaceful lines. One
would wish to think that this were true, and there is evidence that on previous
occasions his influence has been exerted upon the side of peace to of the an
extent which was unwelcome to many of his own subjects. On the other hand, it
is very difficult to believe that such a situation, led up to by many
preparatory steps which included the <i>fons et origo mali</i>, the provocative
and impossible Austrian ultimatum, could have been arranged without the assent
of a man who has notoriously continually interfered directly in all large, and
many small, transactions of state. However this may be, it is beyond dispute
that the action of Great Britain deprived him for the instant of his usual
dignity and courtesy, and he dispatched a verbal message by one of his
aides-de-camp in the following terms:</p>
<p>"The Emperor has charged me to express to your Excellency his regret for the
occurrences of last night, but to tell you at the same time that you will
gather from those occurrences an idea of the feelings of his people respecting
the action of Great Britain in joining with other nations against her old
allies of Waterloo. His Majesty also begs that you will tell the King that he
has been proud of the titles of British Field-Marshal and British Admiral, but
that in consequence of what has occurred he must now at once divest himself of
those titles."</p>
<p>The Ambassador adds feelingly that this message lost nothing of its acerbity
by the manner of its delivery. Some artist of the future will do justice to the
scene where the benign and dignified old diplomatist sat listening to the
rasping utterances of the insolent young Prussian soldier. The actual departure
of the Embassy was effected without molestation, thanks once more to the good
offices of Herr von Jagow. On the same day, in the presence of a large but
silent crowd, the German Ambassador left London and embarked for home in a
vessel placed at his disposal by the British Government. His voyage back, via
Flushing, was safely accomplished, but it is worth recording that it was only
the warning from a British warship which prevented him and his staff from being
blown up by the mines which had already, within a few hours of the outbreak of
hostilities, been strewn thickly by his countrymen in the path of neutral
shipping across the highway of commerce in the North Sea. Should our kinsmen of
America ever find themselves in our place, let them remember that it is "all
in" from the beginning with the Germans.</p>
<p>Let America also remember our experience that no pupil can go to a German
school, no scholar to a German university, and no invalid to a German
health-resort, without the chance of some sudden turn of politics leaving them
as prisoners in the country. Even the elderly heart patients at Nauheim were
detained by the German authorities. An old admiral among them, Admiral Neeld,
made a direct appeal as sailor to sailor to Prince Henry of Prussia, and was
answered by the proverb that "War is war." Our contention is that such actions
are <i>not</i> war, and that their perpetration will never be forgotten or
forgiven by the nations of the world, who can have no security that when their
subjects pass the German frontier they will ever get clear again. Such
practices are, of course, entirely distinct from that of interning reservists
or males of fighting age, which was freely done by the Allies. It is only fair
to say that after a long delay there was a release of schoolgirls, and
afterwards one of doctors, by the Germans, but many harmless travellers,
students, and others were held for a long period of the war at a time when tens
of thousands of Germans were free in Great Britain.</p>
<p>By a gross perversion of facts German publicists have endeavoured to show
that Great Britain was to blame for the final rupture. The pretence is too
absurd to deceive any one, and one can hardly think that they believe it
themselves. One has only to ask what had Great Britain to do with the death of
the Heir Apparent of Austria, with the sending of the fatal ultimatum, with the
declaration of war against Russia and France, or, finally, with the infraction
of the Belgian frontier? She had nothing to do with any one of these things,
which all, save the first, emanated from Vienna or Berlin, and were the obvious
causes of the war. Britain was only involved because she remained true to her
solemn contract, a breach of which would have left her dishonoured. It is mere
effrontery to pretend that she desired war, or that she left anything undone
which could have prevented it. We lay our record with confidence before foreign
nations and posterity. We have nothing to conceal and nothing to regret.</p>
<p>On the other hand, supposing that one were to grant the whole of the German
contention, suppose one were to admit that Germany did not know of the terms of
the Austrian ultimatum or foresee its effect upon the other nations of Europe,
that she took her stand by the side of Austria purely out of motives of
chivalrous loyalty to an ally, and that she was forced, by so doing, to find
herself at variance with Russia and France&mdash;suppose so inconceivable a
hypothesis as this, even then it cannot in any way condone the admitted wrong
which Germany did in invading Belgium, nor does it show any possible cause why,
because Germany was false to her word in this matter, Britain should be so
also. This point is so unanswerable that the only defence, if it can be called
a defence, which Germany has ever put forward is, that if she had not infringed
Belgian neutrality, somebody else would have done so. Not one shadow of
evidence has ever been put forward to justify so monstrous an assertion, which
is certainly not endorsed by the Belgians themselves.</p>
<p>In this connection one may allude to the so-called secret military
engagements which were found and published by the Germans at Brussels and which
were supposed to show that Great Britain herself contemplated the infraction of
Belgian neutrality. One can only realise how bankrupt is Germany of all reason
and argument when one considers such a contention as this. For years the German
threats had been obvious to all the world. They had brought their strategic
railways to the frontier of Belgium, and erected their standing camps there.
Naturally Belgium was alarmed at such preparations and took counsel with Great
Britain how her pledge should be redeemed and how her soil could be defended in
case Germany proved perfidious. It was a simple military precaution which
involved not the breach of a treaty but the fulfilment of one&mdash;not the
invasion of Belgium but its protection after it was invaded. Each successive
so-called "revelation " about the actions of Great Britain has only proved once
more that &mdash;</p>
<p class="cp">"Whatever record leaps to light<br>
She never shall be shamed."</p>
<p>These attempts to confuse the issue irresistibly recall the message of
Frederic to Podowils when he The was about to seize Silesia even as William
seized Belgium. "The question of right," he said, "is the affair of ministers.
It is your affair. It is time to work at it in secret, for the orders to the
troops are given." March first and find some justification later.</p>
<p>Germany would have stood higher in the world's esteem and in the estimate of
history if, instead of playing in most grotesque fashion the wolf to the lamb,
and accusing her unprepared and distracted neighbours of making a surprise
attack upon her at the moment when she was at the height of her preparations,
she had boldly stated her true position. Her dignity and frankness would have
been undeniable if she had said, "I am a great power. I believe I am the
greatest. I am willing to put it to the test of war. I am not satisfied with my
geographical position. I desire a greater seaboard. You must give it to me or I
shall take it. I justify my action by the fact that the position of every state
rests ultimately upon its strength in war, and that I am willing to undergo
that test."</p>
<p>Such a contention would have commanded respect, however much we might resent
it. But these repeated declarations from the Emperor himself, the Chancellor,
and so many others that they were deliberately attacked, coupled with appeals
to the Almighty, make up the most nauseous mixture of falsehood and blasphemy
which the world has ever known. The whole conception of religion became
grotesque, and the Almighty, instead of a universal Father of the human race,
was suddenly transformed into "our good old God," a bloodthirsty tribal deity
worthy of those Prussian pagans who as late as the fourteenth century offered
human sacrifices to their idols in the Eastern Mark. The phenomenon was part of
that general national madness to which, it is to be hoped, the German of the
future will look back with bewilderment and shame.</p>
<p>One contention put forward by certain German apologists in connection with
the war would hardly be worth referring to, were it not for the singular light
which it casts upon the mental and moral position of a large number of the
German public. It was that some special culture had been evolved by Germany
which was of such value that it should be imposed by force upon the rest of the
world. Since culture must in its nature be an international thing, the joint
product of human development, such a claim can only be regarded as a
conspicuous sign of its absence. In spiritual and intellectual matters it could
not be asserted that Germany since 1870 had shown any superiority over France
or England. In many matters she was conspicuously behind. It might fairly be
claimed that in chemistry, in music, and in some forms of criticism, notably
biblical exegesis, she was supreme. But in how many fields was she inferior to
Great Britain? What name had she in poetry to put against Tennyson and
Browning, in zoology to compare with Darwin, in scientific surgery to excel
that of Lister, in travel to balance Stanley, or in the higher human qualities
to equal such a man as Gordon? The fruits of German culture do not bear out the
claim that it should forcibly supplant that of either of the great Western
nations.</p>
<p>We have now seen how the great cloud which had hung so long over Europe
burst at last, and the blast of war swept the land from end to end. We have
passed through the years of hopes and alarms, of the <i>ententes</i> of
optimists and the <i>detentes</i> of politicians, of skirmishes between
journals and wrestles of finance, until we reach the end of it all &mdash; open
primitive warfare between the two great branches of the Germanic family. In a
purple passage Professor Cramb spoke of the days when the high gods of virility
would smile as they looked down upon the chosen children of Odin, the English
and the Germans, locked in the joy of battle. The hour had struck, and it is a
partial record of those crowded and heroic days which is here set forth with
such accuracy of detail as diligence may command and circumstances allow.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="chap2" name="chap2">II. THE
OPENING OF THE WAR</a></h2>
<p class="first">THERE can be no doubt that if Germany had confined her
operations to an attack upon France without any infraction of Belgian
neutrality, the situation in Great Britain would have been extraordinarily
difficult. The Government was the most democratic that has ever been known in
our political history, and it owed its power to an electorate, many of whom
were passionate advocates for peace at almost any conceivable price. The
preparations for naval war, necessitated by the ever-growing German power, had
been accompanied and occasionally retarded by a constant murmur of remonstrance
which swelled periodically into a menacing expostulation. McKenna and Churchill
found their only opponents in the members of their own party, who persistently
refused to look obvious facts in the face, and impatiently swept aside the
figures of the German armaments while they indulged in vague and amiable
aspirations towards international friendship. This large and energetic party
would certainly have most strenuously resisted British interference in a
Continental war. The statesmen who foresaw that the conquest of France would
surely lead to the conquest of Britain might have carried the country with
them, but none the less they would have gone to war with such an incubus upon
them as the traitorous Charles James Fox and his party had been in the days of
Napoleon. A disunited British against a united German Empire would have been a
grievous disadvantage, be our allies who they might, for, as Shakespeare sang,
"If England to herself be true," it is then only that she is formidable.</p>
<p>This great misfortune, however, was obviated by the policy of Germany. The
most peace-loving Briton could not face the national dishonour which would have
been eternally branded upon him had his country without an effort allowed its
guarantee to be treated as waste paper by a great military nation. The whole
people were welded into one, and save for a few freakish individuals who obeyed
their own perversity of mind or passion for notoriety, the country was united
as it has never been in history. A just war seemed to touch the land with some
magic wand, which healed all dissensions and merged into one national whole
those vivid controversies which are, in fact, a sign rather of intense vitality
than of degeneration. In a moment the faddist forgot his fad, the capitalist
his grievance against taxation, the Labour man his feud against Capital, the
Tory his hatred of the Government, even the woman her craving for the vote. A
political millennium seemed to have dawned. Best and most important of all was
the evident sign that the work done of late years to win the friendship of
Ireland had not been in vain. If the mere promise of domestic institutions has
ranged all responsible Irishmen upon one side on the day of battle, what may we
not hope for ourselves and for the Empire when they have been fully established
and Time has alleviated the last lingering memories of an evil past? It is true
that at a later period of the war this fair prospect was somewhat overcast by
an insane rebellion, in which the wrongs of Ireland, once formidable and now
trivial, were allowed by a colossal selfishness to outweigh the martyrdom of
Belgium and the mutilation of France. Still the fact remains (and it must
sustain us in our future efforts for conciliation) that never before have we
had the representative nationalists of Ireland as our allies in a great
struggle.</p>
<p>The leaders of the Unionist party, Lord Lansdowne and Mr. Bonar Law, had
already, on August 2, signified to the Government that they considered Britain
to be honour-bound to France, and would support without hesitation every
practical step to give effect to the alliance. Fortified by this assurance, the
Government could go strongly forward. But after the Belgian infraction, its
position was that of the executive of a united nation. Sir Edward Grey's
analysis in Parliament of the causes which had brought us to war convinced the
reason and claimed the sympathy of every political party, and even the most
fervent advocates of peace found themselves silenced in the presence of the
huge German aggression which could never admit of a peace founded upon mutual
respect and equality, but only of that which comes from ascendancy on the one
side and helplessness upon the other.</p>
<p>Should Britain ever be led into an unjust war, she will soon learn it from
the fearless voices of her children. The independent young nations which are
rising under the red-crossed flag will not be dragged, in the train of the
Mother-Country, into any enterprise of which their conscience does not approve.
But now their assent was whole-hearted. They were vehement in their approval of
the firm stand made for the pledged word of the nation. From every quarter of
the world deep answered deep in its assurance that the sword should not be
sheathed until the wrong was righted and avenged.</p>
<p>Strong, earnest Canada sent her 30,000 men, with her promise of more. Fiery
Australia and New Zealand prepared as many, Maori vying with white man in his
loyalty to the flag. South Africa, under the splendid leadership of Botha,
began to arm, to speak with the foe in her own gates. India poured forth money
and men with a lavish generosity which can never be forgotten in this country.
The throb of loyalty to the old land passed through every smallest Dependency,
and then beyond the frontier to those further lands which had known us as a
just and kindly neighbour. Newfoundland voted a contingent. Ceylon sent of her
best. Little Fiji mustered her company of fighting men, and even the mountains
of Nepaul and the inaccessible plateaux of Thibet were desirous of swelling
that great host, gathered from many races, but all under the one banner which
meant to each a just and liberal rule.</p>
<p>On the very eve of the outbreak of hostilities one man was added to the home
establishment whose presence was worth many army corps. This was Lord
Kitchener, whose boat was actually lying with steam up to bear him away upon a
foreign mission, when, at the last instant, either the universal public demand
or the good sense of the Government recalled him to take supreme charge of the
war. It was a strange and a novel situation that a soldier who was no party
politician should assume the role of War Minister in a political Cabinet, but
the times called for decided measures, and this was among them. From that day
onwards until the dark hour which called him from his uncompleted task the
passer-by who looked up at the massive front of the War Office was gladdened by
the thought that somewhere in the heart of it those stern, immutable eyes were
looking out at Britain's enemies, and that clear, calculating brain was working
for their downfall. Slow, safe, methodical, remorseless, carefully preparing
the means at every stage that led him to the distant but preordained end, he
had shown, both in the Soudan and South Africa, that the race of great British
generals was not yet extinct. He knew and trusted his instrument even as it
knew and trusted him.</p>
<p>That instrument was an army which was remarkably well prepared for its work.
It cannot be said that the Boer War had increased the prestige of the British
forces, though only those who have studied the subject can realise how
difficult was the task with which they were then faced, or how considerable an
achievement it was to bring it to a success. But the campaign had left behind
it a valuable legacy, all the richer because so great a proportion of the land
forces had been drawn into the struggle. In 1914 a large proportion of senior
officers and a considerable number of non-commissioned officers and reservists
had passed through that ordeal, and learned by experience what can be done,
and, even more important, what cannot be done, in face of modern rifles in
skilful hands.</p>
<p>The lesson had been well pressed home after the war, and every general, from
Lord Roberts downwards, had laid emphasis upon the importance of cover and of
accuracy of fire. Apart from the sound technical training of the soldiers, the
administration of the Army had, after an experimental period, fallen into the
hands of Lord Haldane, who has left his mark more deeply than any one since
Cardwell upon the formation of the land forces. A debt of gratitude is owing to
him for his clear thought and his masterful dispositions. Had he been a prophet
as well as organiser, he would no doubt have held his hand before he made the
smallest decrease of our regular forces; but, on the other hand, by turning our
haphazard, amateurish volunteers into the workman-like Territorials, in forming
the invaluable Officers' Training Corps which tapped our public schools for
something better than athletic talent, and in rigidly defining our
expeditionary corps and providing the special reserves for its reinforcements,
he did work for which he can never adequately be thanked. The weapon which he
had fashioned was now thrust into the strong right hand of the new Minister of
War.</p>
<p>It is well to survey this weapon before we show how it was used. The total
personnel of the Army with its reserves called up was about 370,000 men. Of
this 160,000 were set aside as an expeditionary force, but only a portion of
this number could be counted as immediately available on the outbreak of war,
though the system of mobilisation had been brought to a fine point. It was
hoped that three army corps numbering about 110,000 men, with two divisions of
cavalry, about 10,000 horsemen, would be immediately available, petty numbers
as compared with the millions of the Continent, but highly trained professional
soldiers, capable, perhaps, of turning the balance in the clash of equal hosts.
The rest of the Regular Army had to provide garrisons for India, Egypt,
Gibraltar, and other dependencies, but it was hoped that in time nearly all of
it would be available for service.</p>
<p>Behind these first-line troops was the special reserve, something under
100,000 in number, who were the immediate reinforcements to fill the gaps of
battle. Next in order came the Territorials, whose full complement was 340,000
men. Unhappily at this time they were nearly 100,000 under strength, and there
are many who think that if the National Service League in their earnest
campaign, which was inspired by a clear vision of the coming danger, had
insisted upon a great enlargement of this constitutional force, instead of
agitating for a complete change which presented practical and political
difficulties, their efforts would have been more fruitful. These troops were
raw, inexperienced, and only enlisted for home service, but with a fine spirit
they set to work at once to make themselves efficient, and the great majority
signified their readiness to go anywhere at the country's call. Many brigades
were sent abroad at once to relieve the regulars in Egypt and India, while
others were ready to join the fighting line on the Continent after a few
months, where, as will be shown, they acquitted themselves remarkably well. The
enthusiasm for the war rapidly sent the numbers of the Territorials up to
nearly half a million. In addition to these troops there was the promise of
70,000 highly trained men (one quarter of whom were British regulars) from
India. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand came forward to offer some 60,000 men
between them, with the promise of as many more as should be called for. Brave
and hardy, these were splendid raw material, though their actual technical
training was not, save in some special corps, more advanced than that of the
British Territorials. Altogether, the British War Lord could see, at the very
beginning of hostilities, nearly 1,000,000 of men ready to his hand, though in
very different stages of efficiency.</p>
<p>But already he had conceived the idea of a campaign of attrition, and,
looking forward into the years, he was convinced that these forces were
insufficient. Some entirely new <i>cadres</i> must be organised, which should
have no limitations, but be as reliable an instrument as the regular forces of
the Crown. With a prescience which found no counterpart either among our
friends or our foes he fixed three years as a probable term for the war, and he
made preparation accordingly. Early in August he called for half a million
fresh volunteers for the war, and early in October he had got them. Still
unsatisfied, he called for yet another half-million, and before Christmas his
numbers were again complete. It was a wonderful autumn and winter in Britain.
Every common and green was loud with the cries of the instructors, and bare
with the tramp of the men. Nothing has ever been seen in the world's history
which can compare in patriotic effort with that rally to the flag, for no
bounty was offered, and no compulsion used. The spirit of the men was
extraordinarily high. Regiments were filled with gentlemen who gave up every
amenity of life in order to face an arduous and dangerous campaign, while even
greater patriotism was shown by the countless thousands of miners, artisans,
and other well-paid workmen who sacrificed high wages and a home life in order
to serve for an indefinite time upon the humble pay of the soldier, leaving,
very often, a wife and children in straitened circumstances behind them. It is
at such times that a democratic country reaps the rich fruits of its democracy,
for if you make the land such that it is good to live in, so also does it
become good to die for. These forces could not be ready, even with the best of
wills, and the most intensive culture, before the summer of 1915, but at that
date, including her sea forces. Great Britain had not less than 2,000,000
volunteers under arms and ready for immediate use, a number which had risen to
4,000,000 by the end of that year, and 5,000,000 by the spring of 1916.</p>
<p>So much for the wise provisions of Lord Kitchener, which would have been
useless had they not been supported by a stern and self-sacrificing national
spirit. The crisis was met with a cold determination which gave some
superficial observers the impression that the nation was listless, when it was,
in truth, far too earnest for mere shoutings or flag-waving. "Wakened at last!"
cried some foreign cartoon when a German outrage aroused the country for an
instant to some visible gleam of wrath. A deeper observer might have known that
a country which finds 5,000,000 volunteer fighters, and which, instead of
putting the expenses of the war upon future generations, as was done by
Germany, elects to meet a considerable proportion of them by present taxation,
is in grim earnest from the start. The income tax was doubled without a
remonstrance by a unanimous vote of the Commons, thus finding an extra
&pound;40,000,000 a year for the prosecution of the war. Other taxes were
levied by which the working classes bore their air share of the burden, and
they also elicited no complaints. Before Christmas no less than
&pound;450,000,000 had been raised by a loan, a gigantic financial effort which
was easily borne at a charge of 4 per cent.</p>
<p>But if Britain was able to face the future with confidence, both in finance
and in her military preparation, it was entirely to her silent, invisible, but
most efficient Navy that she owed it. By wise foresight the Grand Fleet,
numbering some 400 vessels, had been assembled for Royal inspection before the
storm broke and when it was but a rising cloud-bank upon the horizon. This
all-important move has been attributed to Prince Louis of Battenberg, First Sea
Lord of the Admiralty, but it could not have been done without the hearty
concurrence and cooperation of Mr. Winston Churchill, who should share the
honour, even as he would have shared the blame had we been caught unawares. The
so-called inspection had hardly been completed at Spithead before war was upon
us, and the Fleet, ready manned, provisioned, and armed, moved straight away to
take up its war stations. The main fighting squadrons vanished into a strategic
mist from which they did not emerge for very many months, but it was understood
that they were assembled at centres like Scapa Flow and Cromarty Firth which
were outside the radius of the German torpedo-boats and smaller submarines,
while they were near enough to the enemy's ports to be able to bring him to
action should he emerge.</p>
<p>Numerous patrols of small vessels were let loose in the North Sea to keep in
touch with our opponents, who were well known to be both daring and active. It
is said that no less than 3000 ships, large and small, were flying the white
ensign of St. George. A portion of these were told off for the protection of
the great commercial sea-routes, and for the hunting down of some score of
German cruisers which were known to be at sea. Some of these gave a very good
account of themselves and others were innocuous; but the net result in loss,
which had been discounted in advance as 5 per cent of the merchant fleet at
sea, worked out at less than half that figure, and, by the new year, the
marauders had been practically exterminated.</p>
<p>Now as always&mdash;but now more than ever in the past&mdash;it was
absolutely vital to hold the seas. Who wins the sea wins Britain. Of every five
loaves in the country four come to us from abroad, and our position in meat is
no better. It is victory or starvation when we fight upon the sea. It is ill to
play for such stakes, however safe the game&mdash;worse still when it is a game
where the value of some of the cards is unknown. We have little to fear from a
raid, nothing from invasion, everything from interference with our commerce. It
is one of the points in which our party politics, which blind so many people to
reason, might well have brought absolute ruin upon the country. The cultivation
of British food supplies should never have been a question of free trade or
protection, but rather of vital national insurance.</p>
<p>Had the war come ten years later we might have been in deadly danger, owing
to the rapidly growing power of the submarine. These engines turned upon our
food-carriers might well have starved us out, especially if we had continued
our national folly in being scared by bogeys from building a Channel tunnel.
But by a merciful Providence the struggle came at a moment when the submarine
was half of the developed, and had not yet reached either the speed or the
range of action which would make it the determining factor in a war. As it was,
the fruits of submarine warfare, in spite of a wise and timely warning on the
eve of hostilities by Admiral Sir Percy Scott, astonished the public, but the
mischief done was a very small thing compared to the possibilities which have
to be most carefully guarded against in the future.</p>
<p>In their present stage of development, the submarine could only annoy. With
the great fleet in existence and with the shipbuilding facilities of Great
Britain, nothing could vitally harm her save the loss of a pitched battle. The
British superiority was rather in her small craft than in her large ones, but
in capital ships she was able to place in line at the beginning of the war
enough to give a sufficient margin of insurance. There was never any tendency
to underrate the excellence of the hostile ships, nor the courage and
efficiency of the men. It was well understood that when they came out they
would give a good account of themselves, and also that they would not come out
until the circumstances seemed propitious. They were under a disadvantage in
that the Russian fleet, though small, was not negligible, and therefore some
portion of the German force on sea as well as on land had always to face
eastwards. Also the British had the French for their allies, and, though the
great ships of the latter were nearly all in the Mediterranean, a swarm of
small craft was ready to buzz out of her western ports should the war come
down-channel.</p>
<p>Yet another advantage lay with the British in that their geographical
position put a six-hundred-mile-long breakwater right across the entrance to
Germany, leaving only two sally-ports north and south by which commerce could
enter or raiders escape. The result was the immediate utter annihilation of
Germany's sea-borne commerce. Altogether it must be admitted that Germany was
grievously handicapped at sea, and that she deserves the more credit for
whatever she accomplished, save when, as on land, she transgressed and degraded
the recognised laws of civilised warfare. It is time now to turn to those
military events upon the Continent which were the precursors of that British
campaign which is the subject of this volume.</p>
<p>Want of space and accurate material make it impossible to do justice here to
the deeds of our Allies, but an attempt must be made to indicate briefly the
main phases of the struggle abroad, since its course reacted continually upon
the British operations. It may be shortly stated, then, that so far as the
western theatre of war was concerned, hostilities commenced by two movements,
one an attack by the French upon the occupants of those lost provinces for
which they had mourned during forty-four years, and the other the advance of
the Germans over the Belgian frontier.</p>
<p>The former was a matter of no great importance. It took two distinct lines,
the one from the Belfort region into Alsace, and the other from Nancy as a
centre into Lorraine. The Alsatian venture gained some ground which was never
wholly lost, and was adorned by one small victory near M&uuml;lhausen before it
was checked by the German defence. The Lorraine advance had also some initial
success, but was finally thrown back on August 20 in a severe action in which
the French, were defeated. Luneville, across the of the French frontier, was
occupied by the Germans, but they made no headway, and their subsequent
attempts upon Nancy were repulsed by the army of General Castelnau. General
Pau, a fiery, one-armed septuagenarian, was the French leader in the Alsatian
invasion, but it was soon realised by General Joffre that he and the bulk of
his men would be more useful at the vital point upon the northern frontier, to
which early in September they were transferred.</p>
<p>The main drama, however, quickly unfolded upon the Belgian frontier. Speed
and secrecy were vital to the German plans. On July 31, before any declaration
of war, and while the German representative at Brussels was perjuring his soul
in his country's service by representing that no infringement was possible,
three German army corps, the seventh, ninth, and tenth, fully mobilised and
highly equipped, were moving up from their quarters so as to be ready for a
treacherous pounce upon their little neighbour whom they were pledged to
defend. Von Emmich was in command. On the night of Saturday, August 1, the
vanguard of the German armies, using motor traffic followed by trains, burst
through the neutral Duchy of Luxemburg, and on August 3 they were over the
Belgian line at Verviers. The long-meditated crime had been done, and, with
loud appeals to God, Germany began her fatal campaign by deliberate perjury and
arrogant disdain for treaties. God accepted the appeal, and swiftly showed how
the weakest State with absolute right upon its side may bring to naught all the
crafty plottings of the strong. For time was the essence of the situation. For
this the innumerable motors, for this the light equipment and the lack of
transport. It was on, on, at The top speed, that there be no hindrance in the
path of of the the great hosts that soon would be closing up behind. But time
was life and death for the French also, with their slower mobilisation, their
backward preparation, and their expectations from Great Britain. Time was the
precious gift which little Belgium gave to the Allies. She gave them days and
days, and every day worth an army corps. The Germans had crossed the Meuse, had
taken Vis&eacute;, and then had rushed at Li&egrave;ge, even as the Japanese
had rushed at Port Arthur. With all their military lore, they had not learned
the lesson which was taught so clearly in 1904&mdash;that a fortress is taken
by skill and not by violence alone.</p>
<p>Leman, a great soldier, defended the forts built by Brialmont. Both defender
and designer were justified of their work. On August 5 the seventh German Corps
attempted to rush the gaps between the forts. These gaps were three miles wide,
but were filled with entrenched infantry. The attack was boldly pressed home,
but it completely failed. The German loss was considerable. Two other corps
were called up, and again on August 7 the attack was renewed, but with no
better result. The defenders fought as befitted the descendants of those Belgae
whom Caesar pronounced to be the bravest of the Gauls, or of that Walloon Guard
which had so great a mediaeval reputation. There were 25,000 in the town and
120,000 outside, but they were still outside at the end of the assault.</p>
<p>Li&egrave;ge, however, had one fatal weakness. Its garrison was far too
small to cover the ground. With twelve forts three miles apart it is clear that
there were intervals of, roughly, thirty-six miles to be covered, and that a
garrison of 25,000 men, when you had deducted the gunners for the forts, hardly
left the thinnest skirmish line to cover the ground. So long as the Germans
attacked upon a narrow front they could be held. The instant that they spread
out there were bound to be places where they could march almost unopposed into
the town. This was what occurred. The town was penetrated, but the forts were
intact. General Leman, meanwhile, seeing that the town itself was indefensible,
had sent the garrison out before the place was surrounded. Many a Belgian
soldier fought upon the Yser and helped to turn the tide of that crowning
conflict who would have been a prisoner in Germany had it not been for the
foresight and the decision of General Leman.</p>
<p>The Germans were in the town upon the 8th, but the forts still held out and
the general advance was grievously impeded. Day followed day, and each beyond
price to the Allies. Germany had secretly prepared certain monstrous engines of
war&mdash;one more proof, if proof were needed, that the conflict had been
prearranged and deliberately provoked. These were huge cannon of a dimension
never before cast&mdash;42 centimetres in bore. More mobile and hardly less
effective were some smaller howitzers of 28-centimetre calibre said to have
come from the Austrian foundries at Skoda. Brialmont, when he erected his
concrete and iron cupolas, had not foreseen the Thor's hammer which would be
brought to crush them. One after another they were smashed like eggs. The
heroic Leman was dug out from under the debris of the last fort and lived to
tell of his miraculous escape. Li&egrave;ge was at last in the hands of the
invaders. But already the second week of of the August was at an end&mdash;the
British were crowding into France, the French line was thickening along the
frontier&mdash;all was well with the Allies. Little David had left a grievous
mark upon Goliath.</p>
<p>The German mobilisation was now complete, and the whole vast host, over a
million strong, poured over the frontier. Never was seen such an army, so
accurate and scientific in its general conception, so perfect in its detail.
Nothing had been omitted from its equipment which the most thorough of nations,
after years of careful preparation, could devise. In motor transport,
artillery, machine guns, and all the technique of war they were unrivalled. The
men themselves were of high heart and grand physique. By some twisted process
of reasoning founded upon false information they had been persuaded that this
most aggressive and unnecessary of wars was in some way a war of self-defence,
for it was put to them that unless they attacked their neighbours now, their
neighbours would certainly some day or other attack them. Hence, they were
filled with patriotic ardour and a real conviction that they were protecting
their beloved Fatherland. One could not but admire their self-sacrificing
devotion, though in the dry light of truth and reason they stood forth as the
tools of tyranny, the champions of barbarous political reaction and the bullies
of Europe. It was an ominous fact that the troops were provided in advance with
incendiary discs for the firing of dwellings, which shows that the orgy of
destruction and cruelty which disgraced the name of the German Army in Belgium
and in the north of France was prearranged by some central force, whose
responsibility in this matter can only be described as terrific. They brought
the world of Christ back to the days of Odin, and changed a civilised campaign
to an inroad of pagan Danes. This wicked central force could only be the Chief
Staff of the Army, and in the last instance the Emperor himself. Had Napoleon
conducted his campaigns with as little scruple as William II., it can safely be
said that Europe as we know it would hardly exist to-day, and the monuments of
antiquity and learning would have been wiped from the face of the globe. It is
an evil precedent to be expunged from the records for ever&mdash;all the more
evil because it was practised by a strong nation on a weak one and on a
defenceless people by one which had pledged themselves to defend them. That it
was in no wise caused by any actions upon the part of the Belgians is clearly
proved by the fact that similar atrocities were committed by the German Army
the moment they crossed the frontiers both of France and of Poland.</p>
<p>The Allies had more than they expected from Li&egrave;ge. They had less from
Namur. The grey-green tide of German invasion had swept the Belgian resistance
before it, had flooded into Brussels, and had been dammed for only a very few
days by the great frontier fortress, though it was counted as stronger than
Li&egrave;ge. The fact was that the Germans had now learned their lesson. Never
again would they imagine that the <i>Furor Teutonicus</i> alone could carry a
walled city. The fatal guns were brought up again and the forts were crushed
with mechanical precision, while the defenders between the forts, after
enduring for ten hours a severe shelling, withdrew from their trenches. On
August 22 the fortress surrendered, some of General Michel's garrison being
taken, but a considerable proportion effecting its retreat with the French Army
which had come up to support the town. By the third week of August the remains
of the Belgian forces had taken refuge in Antwerp, and the Germans, having made
a wide sweep with their right wing through Brussels, were descending in a
two-hundred-mile line upon Northern France.</p>
<p>The French plans had in truth been somewhat disarranged by the Belgian
resistance, for the chivalrous spirit of the nation would not permit that their
gallant friends be unsupported. Fresh dispositions had been made, but the
sudden fall of Namur brought them to naught. Before that untoward event the
French had won a small but indubitable victory at Dinant, and had advanced
their line from Namur on the right to Charleroi on the left. With the fall of
Namur their long wall had lost its corner bastion, and they were at once
vigorously attacked by all the German armies, who forced the Sambre on August
22, carried Charleroi, and pushed the French back with considerable loss of
guns and prisoners along the whole line. There was defeat, but there was
nothing in the nature of a rout or of an envelopment. The line fell back
fighting tooth and nail, but none the less Northern France was thrown open to
the invaders. In this general movement the British forces were involved, and we
now turn to a more particular and detailed account of what befell them during
these most momentous days.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="chap3" name="chap3">III. THE
BATTLE OF MONS</a></h2>
<p class="chaphead">The landing of the British in France&mdash;The British
leaders&mdash;The advance to Mons&mdash;The defence of the bridges of
Nimy&mdash;The holding of the canal&mdash;The fateful telegram &mdash; The
rearguard actions of Frameries, Wasmes, and Dour&mdash;The charge of the
Lancers&mdash;The fate of the Cheshires&mdash;The 7th Brigade at
Solesmes&mdash;The Guards in action&mdash;The Germans' rude awakening
&mdash;The Connaughts at Pont-sur-Sambre</p>
<p class="first">THE bulk of the British Expeditionary Force passed over to
France under cover of darkness on the nights of August 12 and 13, 1914. The
movement, which included four infantry divisions and a cavalry division,
necessitated the transportation of approximately 90,000 men, 15,000 horses, and
400 guns, It is doubtful if so large a host has ever been moved by water in so
short a time in all the annals of military history. There was drama in the
secrecy and celerity of the affair. Two canvas walls converging into a funnel
screened the approaches to Southampton Dock. All beyond was darkness and
mystery. Down this fatal funnel passed the flower of the youth of Britain, and
their folk saw them no more. They had embarked upon the great adventure of the
German War. The crowds in the streets saw the last serried files vanish into
the darkness of the docks, heard the measured tramp upon the stone quays dying
farther away in the silence of the night, until at last all was still and the
great steamers were pushing out into the darkness.</p>
<p>No finer force for technical efficiency, and no body of men more hot-hearted
in their keen desire to serve their country, have ever left the shores of
Britain. It is a conservative estimate to say that within four months a half of
their number were either dead or in the hospitals. They were destined for great
glory, and for that great loss which is the measure of their glory.</p>
<p>Belated pedestrians upon the beach of the southern towns have recorded their
impression of that amazing spectacle. In the clear summer night the wall of
transports seemed to stretch from horizon to horizon. Guardian warships flanked
the mighty column, while swift shadows shooting across the surface of the sea
showed where the torpedo-boats and scouts were nosing and ferreting for any
possible enemy. But far away, hundreds of miles to the north, lay the real
protection of the flotilla, where the smooth waters of the Heligoland Bight
were broken by the sudden rise and dip of the blockading periscopes.</p>
<p>It is well to state, once for all, the composition of this force, so that in
the succeeding pages, when a brigade or division is under discussion, the
diligent reader may ascertain its composition. This, then, is the First Army
which set forth to France. Others will be chronicled as they appeared upon the
scene of action. It may be remarked that the formation of units was greatly
altered with the progress of the campaign, so that it has been possible without
indiscretion to raise the veil of secrecy which was once so essential.</p>

<br>
<p>Such, was the Army which first set forth to measure itself against the
soldiers of Germany. Prussian bravery, capacity, and organising power had a
high reputation among us, and yet we awaited the result with every confidence,
if the odds of numbers were not overwhelming. It was generally known that
during the period since the last war the training of the troops had greatly
progressed, and many of the men, with nearly all the senior officers, had had
experience in the arduous campaign of South Africa. They could also claim those
advantages which volunteer troops may hope to have over conscripts. At the same
time there was no tendency to underrate the earnest patriotism of our
opponents, and we were well aware that even the numerous Socialists who filled
their ranks were persuaded, incredible as it may seem, that the Fatherland was
really attacked, and were whole-hearted in its defence.</p>
<p>The crossing was safely effected. It has always been the traditional
privilege of the British public to grumble at their public servants and to
speak of "muddling through" to victory. No doubt the criticism has often been
deserved. But on this occasion the supervising General in command, the British
War Office, and the Naval Transport Department all rose to a supreme degree of
excellence in their arrangements. So too did the Railway Companies concerned.
The details were meticulously correct. Without the loss of man, horse, or gun,
the soldiers who had seen the sun set in Hampshire saw it rise in Picardy or in
Normandy. Boulogne and Havre were the chief ports of disembarkation, but many,
including the cavalry, went up the Seine and came ashore at Rouen. The soldiers
everywhere received a rapturous welcome from the populace, which they returned
by a cheerful sobriety of behaviour. The admirable precepts as to wine and
women set forth in Lord Kitchener's parting orders to the Army seem to have
been most scrupulously observed. It is no slight upon the gallantry of
France&mdash;the very home of gallantry &mdash;if it be said that she profited
greatly at this strained, over-anxious time by the arrival of these boisterous
over-sea Allies. The tradition of British solemnity has been for ever killed by
these jovial invaders. It is probable that the beautiful tune, and even the
paltry words of "Tipperary," will pass into history as the marching song, and
often the death-dirge, of that gallant host. The dusty, poplar-lined roads
resounded with their choruses, and the quiet Picardy villages re-echoed their
thunderous and superfluous assurances as to the state of their hearts. All
France broke into a smile at the sight of them, and it was at a moment when a
smile meant much to France.</p>
<p>Whilst the various brigades were with some deliberation preparing for an
advance up-country, there arrived at the Gare du Nord in Paris a single
traveller who may be said to have been the most welcome British visitor who
ever set foot in the city. He was a short, thick man, tanned by an outdoor
life, a solid, impassive personality with a strong, good-humoured face, the
forehead of a thinker above it, and the jaw of an obstinate fighter below.
Overhung brows shaded a pair of keen grey eyes, while the strong, set mouth was
partly concealed by a grizzled moustache. Such was John French, leader of
cavalry in Africa and now Field-Marshal commanding the Expeditionary Forces of
Britain. His defence of Colesberg at a critical period when he bluffed the
superior Boer forces, his dashing relief of Kimberley, and especially the
gallant way in which he had thrown his exhausted cavalry across the path of
Cronje's army in order to hold it while Roberts pinned it down at Paardeberg,
were all exploits which were fresh in the public mind, and gave the soldiers
confidence in their leader.</p>
<p>French might well appreciate the qualities of his immediate subordinates.
Both of his army corps and his cavalry division were in good hands. Haig, like
his leader, was a cavalry man by education, though now entrusted with the
command of the First Army Corps, and destined for an ever-increasing European
reputation. Fifty-four years of age, he still preserved all his natural
energies, whilst he had behind him long years of varied military experience,
including both the Soudanese and the South African campaigns, in both of which
he had gained high distinction. He had the advantage of thoroughly
understanding the mind of his commander, as he had worked under him as Chief of
the Staff in his remarkable operations round Colesberg in those gloomy days
which opened the Boer War.</p>
<p>The Second Army Corps sustained a severe loss before ever it reached the
field of action, for its commander, General Grierson, died suddenly of heart
failure in the train between Havre and Rouen upon August 18. Grierson had been
for many years Military Attach&eacute; in Berlin, and one can well imagine how
often he had longed to measure British soldiers against the self-sufficient
critics around him. At the very last moment the ambition of his lifetime was
denied him. His place, however, was worthily filled by General Smith-Dorrien,
another South African veteran whose brigade in that difficult campaign had been
recognised as one of the very best. Smith-Dorrien was a typical Imperial
soldier in the world-wide character of his service, for he had followed the
flag, and occasionally preceded it, in Zululand, Egypt, the Soudan, Chitral,
and the Tirah before the campaign against the Boers. A sportsman as well as a
soldier, he had very particularly won the affections of the Aldershot division
by his system of trusting to their honour rather than to compulsion in matters
of discipline. It was seldom indeed that his confidence was abused.</p>
<p>Haig and Smith-Dorrien were the two generals upon whom the immediate
operations were to devolve, for the Third Army Corps was late, through no fault
of its own, in coming into line. There remained the Cavalry Division commanded
by General Allenby, who was a column leader in that great class for mounted
tactics held in South Africa a dozen years before. It is remarkable that of the
four leaders in the initial operations of the German War &mdash; French,
Smith-Dorrien, Haig, and Allenby&mdash;three belonged to the cavalry, an arm
which has usually been regarded as active and ornamental rather than
intellectual. Pulteney, the commander of the Third Army Corps, was a product of
the Guards, a veteran of much service and a well-known heavy-game shot. Thus,
neither of the more learned corps were represented among the higher commanders
upon the actual field of battle, but brooding over the whole operations was the
steadfast, untiring brain of Joffre, whilst across the water the silent
Kitchener, remorseless as Destiny, moved the forces of the Empire to the front.
The last word in each case lay with the sappers.</p>
<p>The general plan of campaign was naturally in the hands of General Joffre,
since he was in command of far the greater portion of the Allied Force. It has
been admitted in France that the original dispositions might be open to
criticism, since a number of the French troops had engaged themselves in Alsace
and Lorraine, to the weakening of the line of battle in the north, where the
fate of Paris was to be decided. It is small profit to a nation to injure its
rival ever so grievously in the toe when it is itself in imminent danger of
being stabbed to the heart. A further change in plan had been caused by the
intense sympathy felt both by the French and the British for the gallant
Belgians, who had done so much and gained so many valuable days for the Allies.
It was felt that it would be unchivalrous not to advance and do what was
possible to relieve the intolerable pressure which was crushing them. It was
resolved, therefore, to abandon the plan which had been formed, by which the
Germans should be led as far as possible from their base, and to attack them at
once. For this purpose the French Army changed its whole dispositions, which
had been formed on the idea of an attack from the east, and advanced over the
Belgian frontier, getting into touch with the enemy at Namur and Charleroi, so
as to secure the passages of the Sambre. It was in fulfilling its part as the
left of the Allied line that on August 18 and 19 the British troops began to
move northwards into Belgium. The First Army Corps advanced through Le Nouvion,
St. Remy, and Maubeuge to Kouveroy, which is a village upon the Mons-Chimay
road. There it linked on to the right of the Second Corps, which had moved up
to the line of the Cond&eacute;-Mons Canal. On the morning of Sunday, August
23, all these troops were in position. The 5th Brigade of Cavalry (Chetwode's)
lay out upon the right front at Binche, but the remainder of the cavalry was
brought to a point about five miles behind the centre of the line, so as to be
able to reinforce either flank. The first blood of the land campaign had been
drawn upon August 22 outside Soignies, when a reconnoitring squadron of the 4th
Dragoon Guards under Captain Hornby charged and overthrew a body of the 4th
German Cuirassiers, bringing back some prisoners. The 20th Hussars had enjoyed
a similar experience. It was a small but happy omen.</p>
<p>The forces which now awaited the German attack numbered about 86,000 men,
who may be roughly divided into 76,000 infantry, 10,000 cavalry, and 312 guns.
The general alignment was as follows:</p>
<p>The First Army Corps held the space between Mons and Binche, which was soon
contracted to Bray as the eastward limit. Close to Mons, where the attack was
expected to break, since the town is a point of considerable strategic
importance, there was a thickening of the line of defence. From that point the
Third Division and the Fifth, in the order named, carried on the British
formation down the length of the Mons-Cond&eacute; Canal. The front of the Army
covered nearly twenty miles, an excessive strain upon so small a force in the
presence of a compact enemy. If one looks at the general dispositions, it
becomes clear that Sir John French was preparing for an attack upon his right
flank. From all his information the enemy was to the north and to the east of
him, so that if they set about turning his position it must be from the
Charleroi direction. Hence, his right wing was laid back at an angle to the
rest of his line, and the only cavalry which he kept in advance was thrown out
to Binche in front of this flank. The rest of the cavalry was on the day of
battle drawn in behind the centre of the Army, but as danger began to develop
upon the left flank it was sent across in that direction, so that on the
morning of the 24th it was at Thulin, at the westward end of the line.</p>
<div align="center"><a id="img2" name="img2"><img src=
"12-Doyle-British-Campaign/H241-02.jpg" title=
"Position of 2nd Army Corps, August 23, 1914"></a></div>
<p class="caption">Position of 2nd Army Corps at Mons, August 23, 1914</p>
<br>
<p>The line of the canal was a most tempting position to defend from
Cond&eacute; to Mons, for it ran as straight as a Roman road across the path of
an invader. But it was very different at Mons itself. Here it formed a most
awkward loop. A glance at the diagram will show this formation. It was
impossible to leave it undefended, and yet troops who held it were evidently
subjected to a flanking artillery Are from each side. The canal here was also
crossed by at least three substantial road bridges and one railway bridge. This
section of the defence was under the immediate direction of General
Smith-Dorrien, who at once took steps to prepare a second line of defence,
thrown back to the right rear of the town, so that if the canal were forced the
British array would remain unbroken. The immediate care of this weak point in
the position was committed to General Beauchamp Doran's 8th Brigade, consisting
of the 2nd Royal Scots, 2nd Royal Irish, 4th Middlesex, and 1st Gordon
Highlanders. On their left, occupying the village of Nimy and the western side
of the peninsula, as well as the immediate front of Mons itself, was the 9th
Brigade (Shaw's), containing the 4th Royal Fusiliers, the 1st Northumberland
Fusiliers, and the 1st Royal Scots Fusiliers, together with the 1st Lincolns.
To the left of this brigade, occupying the eastern end of the Mons-Cond&eacute;
line of canal, was Cuthbert's 13th Brigade, containing the 2nd Scottish
Borderers, 2nd West Ridings, 1st West Kents, and 2nd Yorkshire Light Infantry.
It was on these three brigades, and especially on the 8th and 9th, that the
impact of the German army was destined to fall. Beyond them, scattered somewhat
thinly along the line of the Mons-Cond&eacute; Canal from the railway bridge
west of St. Ghislain, were the two remaining brigades of the Fifth Division,
the 14th (Rolt's) and the 15th (Gleichen's), the latter being in divisional
reserve. Still farther to the west the head of the newly arrived 19th Brigade
just touched the canal, and was itself in touch with French cavalry at
Cond&eacute;. Sundry units of artillery and field hospitals had not yet come
up, but otherwise the two corps were complete.</p>
<p>Having reached their ground, the troops, with no realisation of immediate
danger, proceeded to make shallow trenches. Their bands had not been brought to
the front, but the universal singing from one end of the line to the other
showed that the men were in excellent spirits. Cheering news had come in from
the cavalry, detachments of which, as already stated, had ridden out as far as
Soignies, meeting advance patrols of the enemy and coming back with prisoners
and trophies. The guns were drawn up in concealed positions within half a mile
of the line of battle. All was now ready, and officers could be seen on every
elevation peering northwards through their glasses for the first sign of the
enemy. It was a broken country, with large patches of woodland and green spaces
between. There were numerous slag-heaps from old mines, with here and there a
factory and here and there a private dwelling, but the sappers had endeavoured
in the short time to clear a field of fire for the infantry. In order to get
this field of fire in so closely built a neighbourhood, several of the
regiments, such as the West Kents of the 13th and the Cornwalls of the 14th
Brigades, had to take their positions across the canal with bridges in their
rear. Thrilling with anticipation, the men waited for their own first entrance
upon the stupendous drama. They were already weary and footsore, for they had
all done at least two days of forced marching, and the burden of the pack, the
rifle, and the hundred and fifty rounds per man was no light one. They lay
snugly in their trenches under the warm August sun and waited. It was a Sunday,
and more than one have recorded in their letters how in that hour of tension
their thoughts turned to the old home church and the mellow call of the village
bells.</p>
<p>A hovering aeroplane had just slid down with the news that the roads from
the north were alive with the advancing Germans, but the estimate of the
aviator placed them at two corps and a division of cavalry. This coincided
roughly with the accounts brought in by the scouts and, what was more
important, with the forecast of General Joffre. Secure in the belief that he
was flanked upon one side by the 5th French Army, and on the other by a screen
of French cavalry, whilst his front was approached by a force not appreciably
larger than his own. General French had no cause for uneasiness. Had his airmen
taken a wider sweep to the north and west,* or had the French commander among
his many pressing preoccupations been able to give an earlier warning to his
British colleague, the trenches would, no doubt, have been abandoned before a
grey coat had appeared, and the whole Army brought swiftly to a position of
strategical safety. Even now, as they waited expectantly for the enemy, a vast
steel trap was closing up for their destruction.</p>
<p class="footnote">[ *An American correspondent, Mr. Harding Davis, actually
saw a shattered British aeroplane upon the ground in this region. Its
destruction may have been of great strategic importance. This aviator was
probably the first British soldier to fall in the Continental War. ]</p>
<p>Let us take a glance at what was going on over that northern horizon. The
American Powell had seen something of the mighty right swing which was to end
the combat. Invited to a conference with a German general who was pursuing the
national policy of soothing the United States until her own turn should come
round, Mr. Powell left Brussels and chanced to meet Von Kluck's legions upon
their western and southerly trek. He describes with great force the effect upon
his mind of those endless grey columns, all flowing in the same direction,
double files of infantry on either side of the road, and endless guns,
motor-cars, cavalry, and transport between. The men, as he describes them, were
all in the prime of life, and equipped with everything which years of
forethought could devise. He was dazed and awed by the tremendous procession,
its majesty and its self-evident efficiency. It is no wonder, for he was
looking at the chosen legions of the most wonderful army that the world had
ever seen&mdash;an army which represented the last possible word on the
material and mechanical side of war. High in the van a Taube aeroplane, like an
embodiment of that black eagle which is the fitting emblem of a warlike and
rapacious race, pointed the path for the German hordes.</p>
<p>A day or two before, two American correspondents, Mr. Irvin Cobb and Mr.
Harding Davis, had seen the same great army as it streamed westwards through
Louvain and Brussels. They graphically describe how for three consecutive days
and the greater part of three nights they poured past, giving the impression of
unconquerable energy and efficiency, young, enthusiastic, wonderfully equipped.
"Either we shall go forward or we die. We do not expect to fall back ever. If
the generals would let them, the men would run to Paris instead of walking
there." So spoke one of the leaders of that huge invading host, the main part
of which was now heading straight for the British line. A second part, unseen
and unsuspected, were working round by Tournai to the west, hurrying hard to
strike in upon the British flank and rear. The German is a great marcher as
well as a great fighter, and the average rate of progress was little less than
thirty miles a day.</p>
<p>It was after ten o'clock when scouting cavalry were observed falling back.
Then the distant sound of a gun was heard, and a few seconds later a shell
burst some hundreds of yards behind the British lines. The British guns one by
one roared into action. A cloud of smoke rose along the line of the woods in
front from the bursting shrapnel, but nothing could be seen of the German
gunners. The defending guns were also well concealed. Here and there, from
observation points upon buildings and slag-heaps, the controllers of the
batteries were able to indicate targets and register hits unseen by the gunners
themselves. The fire grew warmer and warmer as fresh batteries dashed up and
unlimbered on either side. The noise was horrible, but no enemy had been seen
by the infantry, and little damage done.</p>
<p>But now an ill-omened bird flew over the British lines. Far aloft across the
deep blue sky skimmed the dark Taube, curved, turned, and sailed northwards
again. It had marked the shells bursting beyond the trenches. In an instant, by
some devilish cantrip of signal or wireless, it had set the range right. A rain
of shells roared and crashed along the lines of the shallow trenches. The
injuries were not yet numerous, but they were inexpressibly ghastly. Men who
had hardly seen worse than a cut finger in their lives gazed with horror at the
gross mutilations around them. "One dared not look sideways," said one of them.
Stretcher-bearers bent and heaved while wet, limp forms were hoisted upwards by
their comrades. Officers gave short, sharp words of encouragement or advice.
The minutes seemed very long, and still the shells came raining down. The men
shoved the five-fold clips down into their magazines and waited with weary
patience. A senior officer peering over the end of a trench leaned tensely
forward and rested his glasses upon the grassy edge. "They're coming!" he
whispered to his neighbour. It ran from lip to lip along the line of crouching
men. Heads were poked up here and there above the line of broken earth. Soon,
in spite of the crashing shells overhead, there was a fringe of peering faces.
And there at last in front of them was the German enemy. After all the
centuries, Briton and Teuton faced each other at last for the test of
battle.</p>
<p>A stylist among letter-writers has described that oncoming swarm as grey
clouds drifting over green fields. They had deployed under cover whilst the
batteries were preparing their path, and now over an extended front to the
north-west of Mons they were breaking out from the woods and coming rapidly
onwards. The men fidgeted with their triggers, but no order came to fire. The
officers were gazing with professional interest and surprise at the German
formations. Were these the tactics of the army which had claimed to be the most
scientific in Europe? British observers had seen it in peace-time and had
conjectured that it was a screen for some elaborate tactics held up for the day
of battle. Yet here they were, advancing in what in old Soudan days used to be
described as the twenty-acre formation, against the best riflemen in Europe. It
was not even a shoulder to shoulder column, but a mere crowd, shredding out in
the front and dense to the rear. There was nothing of the swiftly weaving
lines, the rushes of alternate companies, the twinkle and flicker of a modern
attack. It was mediaeval, and yet it was impressive also in its immediate
display of numbers and the ponderous insistence of its onward flow. It was not
many weeks before the stern lesson of war taught very different formations to
those of the grand Kaiser manoeuvres.</p>
<p>The men, still fingering their triggers, gazed expectantly at their
officers, who measured intently the distance of the approaching swarms. The
Germans had already begun to fire in a desultory fashion. Shrapnel was bursting
thickly along the head of their columns but they were coming steadily onwards.
Suddenly a rolling wave of independent firing broke out from the British
position. At some portions of the line the enemy were at eight hundred, at
others at one thousand yards. The men, happy in having something definite to
do, snuggled down earnestly to their work and fired swiftly but deliberately
into the approaching mass. Rifles, machine-guns, and field-pieces were all
roaring together, while the incessant crash of the shells overhead added to the
infernal uproar. Men lost all sense of time as they thrust clip after clip into
their rifles. The German swarms staggered on bravely under that leaden sleet.
Then they halted, vacillated, and finally thinned, shredded out, and drifted
backwards like a grey fog torn by a gale. The woods absorbed them once again,
whilst the rain of shells upon the British trenches became thicker and more
deadly.</p>
<p>There was a lull in the infantry attack, and the British, peering from their
shelters, surveyed with a grim satisfaction the patches and smudges of grey
which showed the effect of their fire. But the rest was not a long one. With
fine courage the German battalions re-formed under the shelter of the trees,
while fresh troops from the rear pushed forward to stiffen the shaken lines.
"Hold your fire!" was the order that ran down the ranks. With the confidence
bred of experience, the men waited and still waited, till the very features of
the Germans could be distinguished. Then once more the deadly fire rippled down
the line, the masses shredded and dissolved, and the fugitives hurried to the
woods. Then came the pause under shell fire, and then once again the emergence
of the infantry, the attack, the check, and the recoil. Such were the general
characteristics of the action at Mons over a large portion of the British
line&mdash;that portion which extended along the actual course of the
canal.</p>
<p>It is not to be supposed, however, that there was a monotony of attack and
defence over the whole of the British position. A large part of the force,
including the whole of the First Army Corps, was threatened rather than
seriously engaged, while the opposite end of the line was also out of the main
track of the storm. It beat most dangerously, as had been foreseen, upon the
troops to the immediate west and north of Mons, and especially upon those which
defended the impossible peninsula formed by the loop of the canal.</p>
<p>There is a road which runs from Mons due north through the village of Nimy
to Jurbise. The defences to the west of this road were in the hands of the 9th
Brigade. The 4th Royal Fusiliers, with the Scots Fusiliers, were the particular
battalions which held the trenches skirting this part of the peninsula, while
half the Northumberland Fusiliers were on the straight canal to the westward.
To the east of Nimy are three road-bridges&mdash;those of Nimy itself, Lock
No.5, and Aubourg Station. All these three bridges were defended by the 4th
Middlesex, who had made shallow trenches which commanded them. The Gordons were
on their immediate right. The field of fire was much interfered with by the
mines and buildings which faced them, so that at this point the Germans could
get up unobserved to the very front. It has also been already explained that
the German artillery could enfilade the peninsula from each side, making the
defence most difficult. A rush of German troops came between eleven and twelve
o'clock across the Aubourg Station Bridge. It was so screened up to the moment
of the advance that neither the rifles nor the machine-guns of the Middlesex
could stop it. It is an undoubted fact that this rush was preceded by a great
crowd of women and children, through which the leading files of the Germans
could hardly be seen. At the same time, or very shortly afterwards, the other
two bridges were forced in a similar manner, but the Germans in all three cases
as they reached the farther side were unable to make any rapid headway against
the British fire, though they made the position untenable for the troops in
trenches between the bridges. The whole of the 8th Brigade, supported by the
2nd Irish Rifles from McCracken's 7th Brigade, which had been held in reserve
at Ciply, were now fully engaged, covering the retirement of the Middlesex and
Gordons. At some points the firing between the two lines of infantry was across
the breadth of a road. Two batteries of the 40th Artillery Brigade, which were
facing the German attack at this point, were badly mauled, one of them, the
23rd R.F.A., losing its gun teams. Major Ingham succeeded in reconstituting his
equipment and getting his guns away.</p>
<p>It is well to accentuate the fact that though this was the point of the most
severe pressure there was never any disorderly retirement, and strong reserves
were available had they been needed. The 8th Brigade, at the time of the
general strategical withdrawal of the Army, made its arrangements in a
methodical fashion, and General Doran kept his hold until after nightfall upon
Bois la Haut, which was an elevation to the east of Mons from which the German
artillery might have harassed the British retreat, since it commanded all the
country to the south. The losses of the brigade had, however, been
considerable, amounting to not less than three hundred and fifty in the case of
the 4th Middlesex, many being killed or wounded in the defence, and some cut
off in the trenches between the various bridge-heads. Majors Davey and Abell of
the Middlesex were respectively wounded and killed, with thirteen other
officers.</p>
<p>It has as already been said that the line of the 4th Royal Fusiliers
extended along the western perimeter up to Nimy Road Bridge, where Colonel
MacMahon's section ended and that of Colonel Hull, of the Middlesex Regiment,
began. To the west of this point was the Nimy Railway Bridge, defended also by
Captain Ashburner's company of the 4th Royal Fusiliers. This was assaulted
early, and was held for nearly five hours against an attack of several German
battalions. The British artillery was unable to help much in the defence, as
the town of Mons behind offered no positions for guns, but the 107th Battery in
the immediate rear did good work. The defence was continued until the Germans
who had already crossed to the east were advancing on the flank. Lieutenant
Maurice Dease, five times wounded before he was killed, worked his machine-gun
to the end, and every man of his detachment was hit. Lieutenant Dease and
Private Godley both received the Victoria Cross. The occupants of one trench,
including Lieutenant Smith, who was wounded, were cut off by the rush. Captain
Carey commanded the covering company and the retirement was conducted in good
order, though Captain Bowden Smith, Lieutenant Mead, and a number of men fell
in the movement. Altogether, the Royal Fusiliers lost five officers and about
two hundred men in the defence of the bridge, Lieutenant Tower having seven
survivors in his platoon of sixty. Captain Byng's company at the Glin Bridge
farther east had severe losses and was driven in in the same way. As the
infantry retired a small party of engineers under Captain Theodore Wright
endeavoured to destroy this and other bridges, Lieutenant Day was twice wounded
in his attempt upon the main Nimy Bridge. Corporal Jarvis received the V.C. for
his exertions in preparing the Jemappes bridge for destruction to the west of
Nimy. Captain Wright, with Sergeant Smith, made an heroic endeavour under
terrific fire to detonate the charge, but was wounded and fell into the canal.
Lieutenant Holt, a brave young officer of reserve engineers, also lost his life
in these operations.</p>
<p>Having held on as long as was possible, the front line of the 9th Brigade
fell back upon the prepared position on high ground between Mons and Frameries,
where the 107th R.F.A. was entrenched. The 4th Royal Fusiliers passed through
Mons and reached the new line in good order and without further loss. The 1st
Royal Scots Fusiliers, however, falling back to the same point on a different
route through Fl&eacute;nu, came under heavy machine-gun fire from a high soil
heap, losing Captain Rose and a hundred men.</p>
<p>The falling back of the 8th and 9th Brigades from the Nimy Peninsula had an
immediate effect upon Cuthbert's 13th Brigade, which was on their left holding
the line up to the railway bridge just east of St. Ghislain. Of this brigade
two battalions, the 1st West Kent on the right and the 2nd Scottish Borderers
on the left, were in the trenches while the 2nd West Riding and the 2nd
Yorkshire Light Infantry were in support, having their centre at Boussu. The
day began by some losses to the West Kent Regiment, who were probably, apart
from cavalry patrols, the first troops to suffer in the great war. A company of
the regiment under Captain Lister was sent across the canal early as a support
to some advancing cavalry, and was driven in about eleven o'clock with a loss
of two officers and about a hundred men.</p>
<p>From this time onwards the German attacks were easily held, though the
German guns were within twelve hundred yards. The situation was changed when it
was learned later in the day that the Germans were across to the right and had
got as far as Fl&eacute;nu on the flank of the brigade. In view of this
advance. General Smith-Dorrien, having no immediate supports, dashed off on a
motor to Sir Douglas Haig's headquarters some four miles distant, and got his
permission to use Haking's 5th Brigade, which pushed up in time to re-establish
the line.</p>
<p>It has been shown that the order of the regiments closely engaged in the
front line was, counting from the east, the 1st Gordons, the 4th Middlesex, the
4th Royal Fusiliers, the 1st Scots Fusiliers, half the 1st Northumberland
Fusiliers, the 1st West Kents, and the 2nd Scottish Borderers, the other
regiments of these brigades being in reserve. The last-named battalion, being
opposite a bridge, was heavily engaged all day, losing many men, but holding
its position intact against repeated advances. On the left hand or western side
of the Scottish Borderers, continuing the line along the canal, one would come
upon the front of the 14th Brigade (Rolt's), which was formed by the 1st Surrey
on the right and the 1st Duke of Cornwall's on the left. The German attack upon
this portion of the line began about 1 P.M., and by 3 P.M. had become so warm
that the reserve companies were drawn into the firing line. Thanks to their
good work, both with rifles and with machine-guns, the regiments held their own
until about six o'clock in the evening, when the retirement of the troops on
their right enabled the Germans to enfilade the right section of the East
Surreys at close range. They were ordered to retire, but lost touch with the
left section, which remained to the north of the canal where their trench was
situated. Captain Benson of this section had been killed and Captain Campbell
severely wounded, but the party of one hundred and ten men under Lieutenant
Morritt held on most gallantly and made a very fine defence. Being finally
surrounded, they endeavoured to cut their way out with cold steel, Lieutenant
Ward being killed and Morritt four times wounded in the attempt. Many of the
men were killed and wounded, and the survivors were taken. Altogether the loss
of the regiment was five officers and one hundred and thirty-four men.</p>
<p>On the left of the East Surreys, as already stated, lay the 1st Duke of
Cornwall's of the same brigade. About four o'clock in the afternoon the
presence of the German outflanking corps first made itself felt. At that hour
the Cornwalls were aware of an advance upon their left as well as their front.
The Cornwalls drew in across the canal in consequence, and the Germans did not
follow them over that evening.</p>
<p>The chief point defended by the 14th Brigade upon this day had been the
bridge and main road which crosses the canal between Pommeroeul and Thulin,
some eight or nine miles west of Mons. In the evening, when the final order for
retreat was given, this bridge was blown up, and the brigade fell back after
nightfall as far as Dour, where it slept.</p>
<p>By the late afternoon the general position was grave, but not critical. The
enemy had lost very heavily, while the men in the trenches were, in comparison,
unscathed. Here and there, as we have seen, the Germans had obtained a lodgment
in the British position, especially at the salient which had always appeared to
be impossible to hold, but, on the other hand, the greater part of the Army,
including the whole First Corps, had not yet been seriously engaged, and there
were reserve troops in the immediate rear of the fighting line who could be
trusted to make good any gap in the ranks before them. The German artillery
fire was heavy and well-directed, but the British batteries had held their own.
Such was the position when, about 5 P.M., a telegram from General Joffre was
put into Sir John French's hand, which must have brought a pang to his heart.
From it he learned that all his work had been in vain, and that far from
contending for victory, he would be fortunate if he saved himself from utter
defeat.</p>
<p>There were two pieces of information in this fatal message, and each was
disastrous. The first announced that instead of the two German corps whom he
had reason to think were in front of him, there were four&mdash;the Third,
Fourth, Seventh, and Fourth Reserve Corps&mdash;forming, with the second and
fourth cavalry divisions, a force of nearly 200,000 men, while the Second Corps
were bringing another 40,000 round his left flank from the direction of
Tournai. The second item was even more serious. Instead of being buttressed up
with French troops on either side of him, he learned that the Germans had burst
the line of the Sambre, and that the French armies on his right were already in
full retreat, while nothing substantial lay upon his left. It was a most
perilous position. The British force lay exposed and unsupported amid
converging foes who far outnumbered it in men and guns. What was the profit of
one day of successful defence if the morrow would dawn upon a British Sedan?
There was only one course of action, and Sir John decided upon it in the
instant, bitter as the decision must have been. The Army must be extricated
from the battle and fall back until it resumed touch with its Allies.</p>
<p>But it is no easy matter to disengage so large an army which is actually in
action and hard-pressed by a numerous and enterprising enemy. The front was
extensive and the lines of retreat were limited. That the operation was carried
out in an orderly fashion is a testimony to the skill of the General, the
talents of the commanders, and the discipline of the units. If it had been done
at once and simultaneously it would certainly have been the signal for a
vigorous German advance and a possible disaster. The positions were therefore
held, though no efforts were made to retake those points where the enemy had
effected a lodgment. There was no possible use in wasting troops in regaining
positions which would in no case be held. As dusk fell, a dusk which was
lightened by the glare of burning villages, some of the regiments began slowly
to draw off to the rear. In the early morning of the 24th the definite order to
retire was conveyed to the corps commanders, whilst immediate measures were
taken to withdraw the impedimenta and to clear the roads.</p>
<p>Such, in its bare outlines, was the action of Mons upon August 23,
interesting for its own sake, but more so as being the first clash between the
British and German armies. One or two questions call for discussion before the
narrative passes on. The most obvious of these is the question of the bridges.
Why were they not blown up in the dangerous peninsula? Without having any
special information upon the point, one might put forward the speculation that
the reason why they were not at once blown up was that the whole of Joffre's
advance was an aggressive movement for the relief of Namur, and that the
bridges were not destroyed because they would be used in a subsequent advance.
It will always be a subject for speculation as to what would have occurred had
the battle been fought to a finish. Considering the comparative merits of
British and German infantry as shown in many a subsequent encounter, and
allowing for the advantage that the defence has over the attack, it is probable
that the odds might not have been too great and that Sir John French might have
remained master of the field. That, however, is a matter of opinion. What is
not a matter of opinion is that the other German armies to the east would have
advanced on the heels of the retiring French, that they would have cut the
British off from their Allies, and that they would have been hard put to it to
reach the coast. Therefore, win or lose, the Army had no possible course open
but to retire. The actual losses of the British were not more than three or
four thousand, the greater part from the 8th, 9th, and 13th Brigades. There are
no means as yet by which the German losses can be taken out from the general
returns, but when one considers the repeated advances over the open and the
constant breaking of the dense attacking formations, it is impossible that they
should have been fewer than from seven to ten thousand men. Each army had for
the first time an opportunity of forming a critical estimate of the other.
German officers have admitted with soldierly frankness that the efficiency of
the British came to them as a revelation, which is not surprising after the
assurances that had been made to them. On the other hand, the British bore away
a very clear conviction of the excellence of the German artillery and of the
plodding bravery of the German infantry, together with a great reassurance as
to their own capacity to hold their own at any reasonable odds.</p>
<p>After a night of flames and of uproar the day dawned, a day of great anxiety
to the British commanders and of considerable pressure upon a portion of the
troops. Sir John French had given instructions that the First Corps, which had
been only slightly engaged the day before, should pretend to assume the
offensive upon the extreme right wing in the direction of Binche, whilst the
Second Corps began its retirement. The enemy was following up rapidly, however,
along the whole length of the British line, both flanks of which were exposed.
Shortly after dawn the evacuated positions had been occupied, and Mons itself
was in the hands of the advancing Germans. The Second Corps began its retreat,
helped by the feint which was carried out by General Haig upon the right, and
by the bulk of the batteries of both corps, but the pursuit was vigorous and
the shell-fire incessant. A shell from the rear is more intimidating than
twenty in the front. Hamilton's Third Division, including the 8th and 9th
Brigades, who had done such hard work the day before, sustained the most severe
losses, especially at Frameries, four miles south of Mons. The 2nd Royal Scots
of the 8th Brigade about midnight had been attacked by a heavy German column
which got so near that the swish of their feet through the long grass put the
regiment on the alert. The attack was blown back by a volley at close quarters.
The 9th Brigade (Shaw's), which covered the retreat, was closely pressed from
dawn by the pursuing Germans, and was subjected to a very heavy shell-fire. A
barricade, erected in the village and manned by Captain Sandilands, of the
Northumberlands, with his company, held up the German advance, and they were
never permitted to reach the line nor to hustle the retirement. Butler's 23rd
Artillery Brigade helped with its fire. The chief losses in this skilful
covering action fell upon the 1st Lincolns and upon the 1st Northumberland
Fusiliers, each of which lost about 150 men, including Captain Rose,
Lieutenants Bulbe, Welchman, and others. There was a stational ambulance in the
village of Frameries, and a foreign nurse in its employ has left a vivid
picture of the wounded British rushing in grimy and breathless to have their
slighter wounds dressed and then running out, rifle in hand, to find their
place in the firing line.</p>
<p>The remaining brigade of the Third Division, McCracken's 7th Brigade, had
detached one regiment, the 2nd Irish Rifles, upon the day before to reinforce
the 8th Brigade, and this regiment had, as already mentioned, some severe
fighting, holding back the German advance after the retirement from the Nimy
Peninsula of the Middlesex and the Gordons. It did not find its way back to its
brigade until the evening of the 24th. The brigade itself, during the first day
of the retreat,, held a position near Ciply, to the south of Mons, where it was
heavily attacked in the early morning, and in some danger as its flank was
exposed. At ten o'clock it was ordered to retire via Genly towards Bavai, and
it carried out this difficult movement in the face of a pushful enemy in
perfect order, covered by the divisional artillery. The principal losses fell
upon the 2nd South Lancashire Regiment, which came under heavy fire from German
machine-guns posted upon slag-heaps. This regiment was very hard hit, losing
several hundred men. The brigade faced round near Bavai and held off the
pursuit.</p>
<p>Cuthbert's 13th Brigade, keeping in line with their comrades on the right,
halted at Wasmes, some four miles from the canal, where they prepared some
hasty entrenchments. Here, at the dawn of day, they were furiously attacked by
the German vanguard at the same time that the 9th Brigade was hustled in
Frameries, but for two hours the assailants were beaten back with heavy losses.
The brunt of the fighting fell upon the 2nd West Riding Regiment, who lost
heavily, were at one time nearly surrounded, and finally, with dour Yorkshire
pertinacity, shook themselves clear. Their losses included their commander.
Colonel Gibbs, their adjutant, 300 men, and all their officers save five. The
1st West Kents also lost about 100 men and several officers, including Major
Pack-Beresford. For the remainder of the day and for the whole of the 25th the
brigade, with the rest of the Fifth Division, fell back with little fighting
via Bavai to the Le Cateau line.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 23rd the 14th Brigade, still farther to the west, had
fallen back to Dour, blowing up the bridge and road over the canal. After dark
the Germans followed them, and Gleichen's 15th Brigade, which had not yet been
engaged, found itself in the position of rearguard and immediately exposed to
the pressure of the German flanking movement. This was now threatening to
envelop the whole of Ferguson's Fifth Division. The situation was particularly
difficult, since this General had to make a flank movement in the face of the
enemy in order to close up with his comrades of the Third Division. He was soon
compelled to call for assistance, and Allenby, with his cavalry division, was
advanced to help him. It was evidently the intention of the enemy to strike in
upon the western side of the division and pin it to its ground until it could
be surrounded.</p>

<p class="caption">First Morning of Retreat of 2nd Army Corps, August 24,
1914</p>
<br>
<p>The first menacing advance in the morning of the 24th was directed against
the flank of the British infantry who were streaming down the Elouges-Dour
high-road. The situation was critical, and a portion of De Lisle' s 2nd Cavalry
Brigade was ordered to charge near Andregnies, the hostile infantry being at
that time about a thousand yards distant, with several batteries in support.
The attack of the cavalry was vigorously supported by L Battery of Horse
Artillery. The charge was carried out by three squadrons of the 9th Lancers,
Colonel Campbell at their head. The 4th Dragoon Guards under Colonel Mullens
was in support. The cavalry rode forward amidst a heavy but not particularly
deadly fire until they were within a few hundred yards of the enemy, when,
being faced by a wire fence, they swung to the right and rallied under the
cover of some slag-heaps and of a railway embankment. Their menace and rifle
fire, or the fine work of Major Sclater-Booth's battery, had the effect of
holding up the German advance for some time, and though the cavalry were much
scattered and disorganised they were able to reunite without any excessive
loss, the total casualties being a little over two hundred. Some hours later
the enemy's pressure again became heavy upon Ferguson's flank, and the 1st
Cheshires and 1st Norfolks, of Gleichen's 15th Brigade, which formed the
infantry flank-guard, incurred heavy losses. It was in this defensive action
that the 119th R.F.A., under Major Alexander, fought itself to a standstill
with only three unwounded gunners by the guns. The battery had silenced one
German unit and was engaged with three others. Only Major Alexander and
Lieutenant Pollard with a few men were left. As the horses had been destroyed
the pieces had to be man-handled out of action. Captain the Hon. F. Grenfell,
of the 9th Lancers, bleeding from two wounds, with several officers, Sergeants
Davids and Turner, and some fifty men of the regiment, saved these guns under a
terrible fire, the German infantry being within close range.</p>
<p>During the whole long, weary day the batteries and horsemen were working
hard to cover the retreat, while the surgeons exposed themselves with great
fearlessness, lingering behind the retiring lines in order to give first aid to
the men who had been hit by the incessant shell-fire. It was in this noble
task&mdash;the noblest surely within the whole range of warfare &mdash; that
Captain Malcolm Leckie, and other brave medical officers, met with a glorious
end, upholding to the full the traditions of their famous corps.</p>
<p>It has been stated that the 1st Cheshires, in endeavouring to screen the
west flank of the Second Corps from the German pursuit, were very badly
punished. This regiment, together with the Norfolks, occupied a low ridge to
the north-east side of the village of Elouges, which they endeavoured to hold
against the onflowing tide of Germans. About three in the afternoon it was seen
that there was danger of this small flank-guard being entirely cut off. As a
matter of fact an order had actually been sent for a retreat, but had not
reached them. Colonel Boger of the Cheshires sent several messengers,
representing the growing danger, but no answer came back. Finally, in
desperation. Colonel Boger went himself and found that the enemy held the
position previously occupied by the rest of Gleichen's Brigade, which had
retired. The Cheshires had by this time endured dreadful losses, and were
practically surrounded. A bayonet charge eased the pressure for a short time,
but the enemy again closed in and the bulk of the survivors, isolated amidst a
hostile army corps, were compelled to surrender. Some escaped in small groups
and made their way through to their retreating comrades. When roll was next
called, there remained 5 officers and 193 men out of 27 officers and 1007 of
all ranks who had gone into action. It speaks volumes for the discipline of the
regiment that this remnant, under Captain Shore, continued to act as a useful
unit. These various episodes, including the severe losses of Gleichen's 15th
Brigade, the attack of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade, and the artillery action in
which the 119th Battery was so severely handled, group themselves into a
separate little action occurring the day after Mons and associated either with
the villages of Elouges or of Dour. The Second German Corps continued to act
upon the western side of the Second British Corps, whilst the rest of General
von Kluck's army followed it behind. With three corps close behind him, and one
snapping at his flank. General Smith-Dorrien made his way southwards, his
gunners and cavalry labouring hard to relieve the ever-increasing pressure,
while his rear brigades were continually sprayed by the German shrapnel.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that Sir John French includes the Ninth German Corps in
Von Kluck's army in his first dispatch, and puts it in Von B&uuml;low's second
army in his second dispatch. The French authorities are of opinion that Von
Kluck's army consisted of the Second, Third, Fourth, Seventh, and Fourth
Reserve Corps, with two divisions of cavalry. If this be correct, then part of
Von B&uuml;low's army was pursuing Haig, while the whole of Von Kluck's was
concentrated upon Smith-Dorrien. This would make the British performance even
more remarkable than it has hitherto appeared, since it would mean that during
the pursuit, and at the subsequent battle, ten German divisions were pressing
upon three British ones.</p>
<p>It is not to be supposed that so huge a force was all moving abreast, or
available simultaneously at any one point. None the less a General can use his
advance corps very much more freely when he knows that every gap can be
speedily filled.</p>
<p>A tiny reinforcement had joined the Army on the morning after the battle of
Mons. This was the 19th Brigade under General Drummond, which consisted of the
1st Middlesex, 1st Scots Rifles, 2nd Welsh Fusiliers, and 2nd Argyll and
Sutherland Highlanders. This detached brigade acted, and continued to act
during a large part of the war, as an independent unit. It detrained at
Valenciennes on August 23, and two regiments, the Middlesex and the
Cameronians, may be said to have taken part in the battle of Mons, since they
formed up at the east of Cond&eacute;, on the extreme left of the British
position, and received, together with the Queen's Bays, who were scouting in
front of them, the first impact of the German flanking corps. They fell back
with the Army upon the 24th and 25th, keeping the line Jenlain &mdash;
Solesmes, finally reaching Le Cateau, where they eventually took up their
position on the right rear of the British Army.</p>
<p>As the Army fell back, the border fortress of Maubeuge with its heavy guns
offered a tempting haven of rest for the weary and overmatched troops, but not
in vain had France lost her army in Metz. Sir John French would have no such
protection, however violently the Germans might push him towards it. "The
British Army Invested in Maubeuge" was not destined to furnish the headline of
a Berlin special edition. The fortress was left to the eastward, and the tired
troops snatched a few hours of rest near Bavai, still pursued by the guns and
the searchlights of their persistent foemen. At an early hour of the 25th the
columns were again on the march for the south, and for safety.</p>
<p>It may be remarked that in all this movement what made the operation most
difficult and complicated was, that in the retirement the Army was not moving
direct to the rear, but diagonally away to the west, thus making the west flank
more difficult to cover as well as complicating the movements of transport. It
was this oblique movement which caused the Third Division to change places with
the Fifth, so that from now onwards it was to the west of the Army.</p>
<p>The greater part of the Fourth Division of the Third Army Corps, coming up
from the lines of communication, brought upon this day a welcome reinforcement
to the Army and did yeoman work in covering the retirement. The total
composition of this division was as follows: &mdash;</p>

<p>These troops, which had been quartered in the Ligny and Montigny area,
received urgent orders at one in the morning of the 25th that they should
advance northwards. They marched that night to Briastre, where they covered the
retreat of the Army, the Third Division passing through their lines. The Fourth
Division then retired south again, having great difficulty in getting along, as
the roads were choked with transport and artillery, and fringed with exhausted
men. The 12th Brigade (Wilson's) was acting as rearguard, and began to
experience pressure from the pursuers, the Essex men being shelled out of the
village of Bethencourt, which they held until it was nearly surrounded by the
German cavalry. The line followed by the division was
Briastre-Viesly-Bethencourt-Caudry-Ligny and Haucourt, the latter village
marking the general position which they were to take up on the left of the Army
at the line of Le Cateau. Such reinforcements were mere handfuls when compared
with the pursuing hosts, but their advent heartened up the British troops and
relieved them of some of the pressure. It has been remarked by officers of the
Fourth Division that they and their men were considerably taken aback by the
worn appearance of the weary regiments from Mons which passed through their
ranks. Their confidence was revived, however, by the undisturbed demeanour of
the General Headquarters Staff, who came through them in the late afternoon of
the 25th. "General French himself struck me as being extremely composed, and
the staff officers looked very cheerful." These are the imponderabilia which
count for much in a campaign.</p>
<p>Tuesday, August 25, was a day of scattered rearguard actions. The weary Army
had rested upon the evening of the 24th upon the general line Maubeuge
-Bavai-Wargnies. Orders were issued for the retirement to continue next day to
a position already partly prepared, in front of the centre of which stood the
town of Le Cateau. All rearguards were to be clear of the above-mentioned line
by 5:30 A.M. The general conception was that the inner flanks of the two corps
should be directed upon Le Cateau.</p>
<p>The intention of the Commander-in-Chief was that the Army should fight in
that position next day, the First Corps occupying the right and the Second
Corps the left of the position. The night of the 25th found the Second Corps in
the position named, whilst their comrades were still at Landrecies, eight miles
to the north-east, with a cavalry brigade endeavouring to bridge the gap
between. It is very certain, in the case of so ardent a leader as Haig, that it
was no fault upon his part which kept him from Smith-Dorrien's side upon the
day of battle. It can only be said that the inevitable delays upon the road
experienced by the First Corps, including the rear-guard actions which it
fought, prevented the ensuing battle from being one in which the British Army
as a whole might have stemmed the rush of Von Kluck's invading host.</p>
<p>Whilst the whole Army had been falling back upon Solesmes, the position
which had been selected for a stand, it was hoped that substantial French
reinforcements were coming up from the south. The roads were much blocked
during the 25th, for two divisions of French territorials were retiring along
them, as well as the British Army. As a consequence progress was slow, and the
German pressure from the rear became ever more severe. Allenby's cavalry and
horse-guns covered the retreat, continually turning round and holding off the
pursuers. Finally, near Solesmes, on the evening of the 25th, the cavalry were
at last driven in, and the Germans came up against McCracken's 7th Brigade, who
held them most skilfully until nightfall with the assistance of the 42nd
Brigade R.F.A. and the 30th Howitzer Brigade. Most of the fighting fell upon
the 1st Wiltshires and 2nd South Lancashires, both of which had substantial
losses. The Germans could make no further progress, and time was given for the
roads to clear and for the artillery to get away. The 7th Brigade then
followed, marching, so far as possible, across country The Battle and taking up
its position, which it did not reach until after midnight, in the village of
Caudry, on the line of the Le Cateau &mdash; Courtrai road. As it faced north
once more it found Snow's Fourth Division upon its left, while on its immediate
right were the 8th and the 9th Brigades, with the Fifth Division on the farther
side of them. One unit of the 7th Brigade, the 2nd Irish Rifles, together with
the 41st R.F.A., swerved off in the darkness and confusion and went away with
the cavalry. The rest were in the battle line. Here we may leave them in
position while we return to trace the fortunes of the First Army Corps.</p>
<p>Sir Douglas Haig's corps, after the feint of August 24, in which the Second
Division appeared to be attacking with the First in support, was cleverly
disengaged from the enemy and fell back by alternate divisions. It was not an
easy operation, and it was conducted under a very heavy shell-fire, which fell
especially upon the covering guns of Colonel Sandilands' 34th Artillery
Brigade. These guns were exposed to a concentration of fire from the enemy,
which was so intense that a thick haze of smoke and dust blotted out the view
for long periods at a time. It was only with difficulty and great gallantry
that they were got away. An officer of the 6th Brigade, immediately behind
them, writes: "Both going in and coming back the limbers passed my trench at a
tearing gallop, the drivers lying low on the horses' necks and screaming at
them to go faster, while on the return the guns bounded about on the stubble
field like so many tin cans behind a runaway dog."</p>
<p>The guns having been drawn in, the corps retired by roads parallel to the
Second Corps, and were able to reach the line Bavai&mdash;Maubeuge by about 7
P.M. upon that evening, being on the immediate eastern flank of Smith-Dorrien's
men. It is a striking example of the historical continuity of the British Army
that as they marched that day many of the regiments, such as the Guards and the
1st King's Liverpool, passed over the graves of their predecessors who had died
under the same colours at Malplaquet in 1709, two hundred and six years
before.</p>
<p>On August 25 General Haig continued his retreat. During the day he fell back
to the west of Maubeuge by Feignies to Vavesnes and Landrecies. The
considerable forest of Mormal intervened between the two sections of the
British Army. On the forenoon of this day the vanguard of the German infantry,
using motor transport, overtook Davies' 6th Brigade, which was acting as
rearguard to the corps. They pushed in to within five hundred yards, but were
driven back by rifle-fire. Other German forces were coming rapidly up and
enveloping the wings of the British rearguard, but the brigade, through swift
and skilful handling, disengaged itself from what was rapidly becoming a
dangerous situation. The weather was exceedingly hot during the day, and with
their heavy packs the men were much exhausted, many of them being barely able
to stagger. In the evening, footsore and weary, they reached the line of
Landrecies, Maroilles, and Pont-sur-Sambre. The 4th Brigade of Guards,
consisting of Grenadiers, Coldstream, and Irish, under General Scott-Kerr,
occupied the town of Landrecies. During the day they had seen little of the
enemy, and they had no reason to believe that the forest, which extended up to
the outskirts of the town, was full of German infantry pressing eagerly to cut
them off. The possession of vast numbers of motor lorries for infantry
transport introduces a new element into strategy, especially the strategy of a
pursuit, which was one of those disagreeable first experiences of up-to-date
warfare which the British Army had to undergo. It ensures that the weary
retreating rearguard shall ever have a perfectly fresh pursuing vanguard at its
heels.</p>
<p>The Guards at Landrecies were put into the empty cavalry barracks for a
much-needed rest, but they had hardly settled down before there was an alarm
that the Germans were coming into the town. It was just after dusk that a
column of infantry debouched from the shadow of the trees and advanced briskly
towards the town. A company of the 3rd Coldstream under Captain Monck gave the
alarm, and the whole regiment stood to arms, while the rest of the brigade, who
could not operate in so confined a space, defended the other entrances of the
town. The van of the approaching Germans shouted out that they were French, and
seemed to have actually got near enough to attack the officer of the picket and
seize a machine-gun before the Guardsmen began to fire. There is a single
approach to the village, and no means of turning it, so that the attack was
forced to come directly down the road.</p>
<p>Possibly the Germans had the impression that they were dealing with
demoralised fugitives, but if so they got a rude awakening. The advance party,
who were endeavouring to drag away the machine-gun, were all shot down, and
their comrades who stormed up to the houses were met with a steady and
murderous fire which drove them back into the shadows of the wood. A gun was
brought up by them, and fired at a range of five hundred yards with shrapnel,
but the Coldstream, reinforced by a second company, lay low or flattened
themselves into the doorways for protection, while the 9th British Battery
replied from a position behind the town. Presently, believing that the way had
been cleared for them, there was a fresh surge of dark masses out of the wood,
and they poured into the throat of the street. The Guards had brought out two
machine-guns, and their fire, together with a succession of volleys from the
rifles, decimated the stormers. Some of them got near enough to throw
hand-bombs among the British, but none effected a lodgment among the
buildings.</p>
<p>From time to time there were fresh advances during the night, designed
apparently rather to tire out the troops than to gain the village. Once fire
was set to the house at the end of the street, but the flames were extinguished
by a party led by Corporal Wyatt, of the 3rd Coldstream. The Irish Guards after
midnight relieved the Coldstream of their vigil, and in the early morning the
tired but victorious brigade went forward unmolested upon their way. They had
lost 170 of their number, nearly all from the two Coldstream companies. Lord
Hawarden and the Hon. Windsor Clive of the Coldstream and Lieut. Vereker of the
Grenadiers were killed, four other officers were wounded. The Germans in their
close attacking formation had suffered very much more heavily. Their enterprise
was a daring one, for they had pushed far forward to get command of the
Landrecies Bridge, but their audacity became foolhardy when faced by steady,
unshaken infantry. History has shown many times before that a retreating
British Army still retains a sting in its tail.</p>
<p>At the same time as the Guards' Brigade was attacked at Landrecies there was
an advance from the forest against Maroilles, which is four miles to the
eastward. A troop of the 15th Hussars guarding a bridge over the Sambre near
that point was driven in by the enemy, and two attempts on the part of the 1st
Berkshires, of Davies' 6th Brigade, to retake it were repulsed, owing to the
fact that the only approach was by a narrow causeway with marshland on either
side, where it was not possible for infantry to deploy. The 1st Rifles were
ordered to support the Berkshires, but darkness had fallen and nothing could be
done. The casualties in this skirmish amounted to 124 killed, wounded, or
missing. The Landrecies and Maroilles wounded were left behind with some of the
medical staff. At this period of the war the British had not yet understood the
qualities of the enemy, and several times made the mistake of trusting surgeons
and orderlies to their mercy, with the result that they were inhumanly treated,
both by the authorities at the front and by the populace in Germany, whither
they were conveyed as starving prisoners of war. Five of them, Captains Edmunds
and Hamilton, Lieut. Danks (all of the Army Medical Corps), with Dr. Austin and
Dr. Elliott, who were exchanged in January 1915, deposed that they were left
absolutely without food for long periods. It is only fair to state that at a
later date, with a few scandalous exceptions, such as that of Wittenberg, the
German treatment of prisoners, though often harsh, was no longer barbarous. For
the first six months, however, it was brutal in the extreme, and frequently
accompanied by torture as well as neglect. A Spanish prisoner, incarcerated by
mistake, has given very clear neutral evidence of the abominable punishments of
the prison camps. His account reads more like the doings of Iroquois than of a
Christian nation.</p>
<p>A Small mishap&mdash;small on the scale of such a war, though serious enough
in itself&mdash;befell a unit of the First Army Corps on the morning after the
Landrecies engagement. The portion of the German army who pursued General Haig
had up to now been able to effect little, and that little at considerable cost
to themselves. Early on August 26, however, a brisk action was fought near
Pont-sur-Sambre, in which the 2nd Connaughts, of Haking's Fifth Brigade, lost
six officers, including Colonel Abercrombie, who was taken prisoner, and 280
men. The regiment was cut off by a rapidly advancing enemy in a country which
was so thickly enclosed that there was great difficulty in keeping touch
between the various companies or in conveying their danger to the rest of the
brigade. By steadiness and judgment the battalion was extricated from a most
difficult position, but it was at the heavy cost already quoted. In this case
again the use by the enemy of great numbers of motor lorries in their pursuit
accounts for the suddenness and severity of the attacks which now and
afterwards fell upon the British rearguards.</p>
<p>Dawn broke upon August 26, a day upon which the exhausted troops were
destined to be tried to the limit of human endurance. It was the date of Von
Kluck's exultant telegram in which he declared that he held them surrounded, a
telegram which set Berlin fluttering with flags. On this day the First Army
Corps was unmolested in its march, reaching the Venerolles line that night.
There was woody country upon the west of it, and from beyond this curtain of
trees they heard the distant roar of a terrific cannonade, and knew that a
great battle was in progress to the westward. It was on Smith-Dorrien's Second
Corps and upon the single division of the Third Corps that the full storm of
the German attack had broken. In a word, a corps and a half of British troops,
with 225 guns, were assailed by certainly four and probably five German corps,
with 600 guns. It is no wonder that the premature tidings of a great German
triumph were forwarded that morning to make one more item in that flood of good
news which from August 21 to the end of the month was pouring in upon the
German people. A glittering mirage lay before them. The French lines had been
hurled back from the frontier, the British were in full retreat, and now were
faced with absolute disaster. Behind these breaking lines lay the precious
capital, the brain and heart of France. But God is not always with the big
battalions, and the end was not yet.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="chap4" name="chap4">IV. THE BATTLE
OF LE CATEAU</a></h2>

views of General Joffre&mdash;Battery L&mdash;The action of
Villars-Cotteret&mdash;Reunion of the Army</p>
<p class="first">REFERENCE has already been made to the retirement of
Smith-Dorrien's Second Corps, covered by Allenby's cavalry, throughout the
25th. The heads of columns arrived at the Le Cateau position at about 3 P.M.,
but the rearguards were fighting into the night, and came in eventually in an
exhausted condition. The Fourth Division, which was still quite fresh, did good
and indeed vital service by allowing the tired units to pass through its ranks
and acting as a pivot upon which the cavalry could fall back.</p>
<p>Sir John French had reconsidered the idea of making a stand at Le Cateau,
feeling, no doubt, that if his whole Army could not be consolidated there the
affair would be too desperate. He had moved with his staff during the evening
of the 25th to St. Quentin, leaving word that the retirement should be
continued early next morning. Smith-Dorrien spent the afternoon and evening
going round the position, but it was not until 2 A.M. upon the morning of the
26th that he was able to ascertain the whereabouts of all his scattered and
weary units. About that time General Allenby reported that his cavalry had been
widely separated, two and a half brigades being at Chatillon, six miles east of
Le Cateau, the other one and a half brigades being near Ligny, four miles west
of the same town. General Smith-Dorrien was in the position that his troops
were scattered, weary, and in danger of losing their morale through continued
retreat in the presence of an ever-pressing enemy. Even with the best soldiers
such an experience too long continued may turn an army into a rabble. He
therefore made urgent representations by telephone to the Commander-in-Chief,
pointing out that the only hope of checking the dangerous German pursuit was to
stagger them by a severe counter. "The only thing for the men to do when they
can't stand is to lie down and fight," said he. Sir John assented to the view,
with the proviso that the retirement should be continued as soon as possible.
Smith-Dorrien, taking under his orders the cavalry, the Fourth Division, and
the 19th Brigade, as well as his own corps, issued instructions for the battle
which he knew must begin within a few hours.</p>
<p>Owing to the gap of eight miles between the nearest points of the two corps,
both flanks of the position were in the air. Smith-Dorrien therefore requested
the cavalry brigades from Chatillon to move in and guard the east flank, while
the rest of the cavalry watched the west. He was less anxious about the latter,
as he knew that Sordet's French cavalry was in that direction.</p>
<p>The exhausted infantry, who had now been marching for about a week, and
fighting for three days and the greater part of three nights, flung themselves
down where best they could, some to the north-east of Le Cateau, some in the
town, and some along the line of very inadequate trenches hastily prepared by
civilian labour. In the early dawn they took up their position, the Fifth
Division being to the right near the town. Of this division, the 14th Brigade
(Rolt's) was on the extreme right, the 13th (Cuthbert's) to the left of it, and
the 15th (Gleichen's) to the left again. To the west of the Fifth Division lay
the Third, their trenches covering the villages of Troisville (9th Brigade),
Audencourt (8th Brigade), and Caudry (7th Brigade). Behind Caudry one and a
half brigades of cavalry were in reserve to strengthen the left wing. From
Caudry the line was thrown back to meet a flanking movement and extended to
Haucourt. This portion was held by Snow's Fourth Division. Sordet's cavalry had
passed across the rear of the British position the day before, and lay now to
the left flank and rear of the Army. There were rumours of approaching French
forces from the south, which put heart into the weary men, but, as a matter of
fact, they had only their own brave spirits upon which to depend. Their
numbers, putting every unit at its full complement, were about 70,000 men.
Their opponents were four army corps at the least, with two divisions of
cavalry&mdash;say, 170,000 men with an overpowering artillery. Subsequent
reports showed that the guns of all five army corps had been concentrated for
the battle.</p>
<p>It has been said that Rolt's 14th Brigade was at the extreme right of the
line. This statement needs some expansion. The 14th Brigade consisted of the
1st East Surrey, 2nd Suffolk, 2nd Manchester, and 1st Cornwalls. Of these four
regiments, half of the East Surrey had been detached on escort duty and the
other half, under Colonel Longley, with the whole of the Cornwalls, bivouacked
in the northern suburbs of Le Cateau on the night of the 25th. In the early
morning of the 26th the enemy's advanced guard got into the town, and this
detachment of British troops were cut off from their comrades and fired upon as
they assembled in the streets of the town. They made their way out, however, in
orderly fashion and took up a position to the south-east of the town, where
they fought an action on their own account for some hours, quite apart from the
rest of the Army, which they could hear but not see. Eventually the division of
cavalry fell back from Chatillon to join the Army and picked up these troops en
route, so that the united body was able to make its way safely back to their
comrades. These troops were out of the main battle, but did good work in
covering the retreat. The whole signal section of the 14th Brigade was with
them, which greatly hampered the brigade during the battle. Two companies of
the 1st East Surreys under Major Tew had become separated from their comrades
after Mons, but they rejoined the British line at Troisville, and on the
morning of August 26 were able to fall in on the rear of the 14th Brigade,
where, as will be seen later, they did good service.</p>
<p>The 19th Brigade had also bivouacked in Le Cateau and was nearly cut off, as
the two regiments of the 14th Brigade had been, by the sudden intrusion of the
enemy. It had been able to make its way out of the town, however, without being
separated from the rest of the Army, and it took up its position on the right
rear of the infantry line, whence it sent help where needed and played the part
of a reserve until towards the close of the action its presence became very
vital to the Fifth Division. At the outset the 2nd Argyll and Sutherlands were
in the front line of this brigade and the 1st Middlesex supporting them, while
the other two battalions, the 2nd Welsh Fusiliers and 1st Scots Rifles, with a
battery of artillery had been taken as a reserve by the force commander. No
trenches had been prepared at this point, and the losses of the two front
battalions from shell-fire were, from the beginning, very heavy. The other two
battalions spent a day of marching rather than fighting, being sent right
across to reinforce the Fourth Division and then being brought back to the
right flank once more.</p>
<p>It was the Fifth Division, on the right of the line, who first experienced
the full effect of the heavy shelling which about seven o'clock became general
along the whole position, but was always most severe upon the right. There was
a dangerous salient in the trenches at the cross-roads one mile west of Le
Cateau which was a source of very great weakness. Every effort was made to
strengthen the trenches, the 15th Brigade and 59th Company R.E. working
especially hard in the Troisville section. The Germans were moving round upon
this right wing, and the murderous hail of missiles came from the flank as well
as from the front, being supplemented by rifle and machine-gun fire. The 2nd
Suffoiks and 2nd Manchesters, the remaining half of Rolt's 14th Brigade, being
on the extreme right of the line, suffered the most. The guns immediately
supporting them, of the 28th Artillery Brigade, were quite overmatched and were
overwhelmed by the devastating rain of shells, many of them being put out of
action. A heavy battery, The Battle the 108th, some little distance behind the
line, kept Le Cateau. up a steady and effective fire which long held back the
German advance. The pressure, however, was extreme, and growing steadily from
hour to hour until it became well-nigh intolerable. Especially it fell upon the
2nd Suffolks, who held their shallow trenches with splendid tenacity. Their
colonel, Brett, was killed. Major Doughty was wounded in three places, Captains
Orford and Cutbill, with eight lieutenants, were on the ground. Finally, when
the position of the brigade became untenable and it was ordered to retreat, the
gallant Suffolks held on to their line with the desire of saving the disabled
guns, and were eventually all killed, wounded, or taken, save for about 250
men, while their neighbours, the 2nd Manchesters, lost 14 officers and 350 of
their men. In this way the extreme right of the British line was practically
destroyed.</p>

"Sketch of Battle of Le Cateau, August 26, 1914"></a></div>
<p class="caption">Sketch of the Battle of Le Cateau, August 26, 1914</p>
<br>
<p>The 19th Brigade, in the rear of the 14th, were able to observe the fate of
their comrades, and about midday the 2nd Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, who
had already lost a good many men from shell-fire, advanced in the chivalrous
hope of relieving the pressure. The battalion went forward as if on parade,
though the casualties were numerous. They eventually gained the shelter of some
trenches near the remains of the 14th Brigade, but their gallant effort,
instead of averting the threatened destruction, ended by partially involving
them in the same fate. They could do nothing against the concentrated and
well-directed artillery fire of the enemy. When eventually they fell back, part
of two companies were cut off in their trench and taken. The rest of the
regiment, together with the 1st Middlesex and two companies of the Royal Scots
Fusiliers from the 9th Brigade, formed a covering line on a ridge in the rear
and held back the German advance for a long time. This line did not retire
until 5 P.M., when it was nearly enveloped. General Drummond, commanding the
19th Brigade, had met with an injury in the course of the action, and it was
commanded during the latter part by Colonel Ward, of the Middlesex.</p>
<p>The retirement or destruction of the 14th Brigade exposed the flank of the
13th (Cuthbert's) to murderous enfilade fire, which fell chiefly upon the 2nd
Yorkshire Light Infantry. This brigade had defended itself successfully for six
hours against various frontal attacks, but now the flank-fire raked it from end
to end and practically destroyed the Yorkshiremen, who were the most exposed to
it. On them and on the 2nd Scottish Borderers fell the great bulk of the
losses, for the West Kents and the survivors of the West Ridings were in
reserve. Of the two companies of the Yorkshire Light Infantry who held the
foremost trenches, that on the right had only fifteen men left, with whom Major
Yate attempted a final charge, finding his Victoria Cross in the effort, while
the next company, under Major Trevor, had only forty-one survivors, the whole
losses of the battalion being 600 men, with 20 officers. Both the Yorkshire and
the Scottish Border battalions lost their colonels in the action. Their losses
were shared by the two companies of the 1st East Surreys under Major Tew, who
had been placed between the 14th and 13th Brigades, and who fought very
steadily in shallow trenches, holding on to the last possible moment.</p>
<p>Whilst the battle was going badly on the right, the Third Division in the
centre and the Fourth Division on the left had held their own against a
succession of attacks. The 8th and 9th Brigades drove off the German infantry
with their crushing rifle-fire, and endured as best they might the shelling,
which was formidable and yet very much less severe than that to which the Fifth
Division had been exposed. In the case of the 7th Brigade (McCracken's) the
village of Caudry, which it defended, formed a salient, since the Fourth
Division on the left was thrown back. The attack upon this brigade from
daylight onwards was very severe, but the assailants could neither drive in the
line nor capture the village of Caudry. They attacked on both flanks at short
rifle range, inflicting and also enduring heavy losses. In this part of the
field the British guns held their own easily against the German, the proportion
of numbers being more equal than on the right of the line.</p>
<p>Whilst the right flank was crumbling before the terrific concentration of
German guns, and while the centre was stoutly holding its own, farther to the
west, in the Haucourt&mdash;Ligny direction, the Second German Army Corps was
beating hard against Snow's Fourth Division, which was thrown back to protect
the left flank of the Army, and to cover the Cambrai-Esnes road.
Hunter-Weston's 11th Brigade was on the right, south of Fontaine, with Wilson's
12th upon its left, and Haldane's 10th in reserve at Haucourt. As the German
attack came from the left, or western flank, the 12th Brigade received the
first impact. The artillery of the division had not yet come up, and the 1st
Royal Lancasters, stretched in a turnip patch, endured for some time a severe
The fire which cost them many casualties, including their Colonel Dykes, and to
which little reply could be made. There were no cavalry scouts in front of the
infantry, so that working parties and advanced posts were cut up by sudden
machine-gun fire. Some of the covering parties both of the Lancasters and of
the 2nd Lancashire Fusiliers were never seen again. At about seven the British
guns came up, the 14th Brigade R.F.A. on the left, the 29th in the centre, and
the 32nd on the right, with the howitzers of the 37th behind the right centre
on the high ground near Selvigny. From this time onward they supported the
infantry in the most self-sacrificing way. The German infantry advance began
shortly afterwards, and was carried out by wave after wave of men. A company of
the 2nd Essex Regiment, under Captain Vandeleur, upon the British left, having
good cover and a clear field of fire, inflicted very heavy losses on the
Germans, though they were finally overwhelmed, their leader having been killed.
The 2nd Lancashire Fusiliers in the front line were also heavily attacked, and
held their own for several hours. About ten o'clock the pressure was so great
that the defence was driven in, and two battalions lost their machine-guns, but
a new line was formed in the Haucourt-Esnes road, the retirement being
skilfully covered by Colonel Anley, of the Essex, and Colonel Griffin, of the
Lancashire Fusiliers. There the 2nd Inniskilling Fusiliers, the 1st Royal
Lancasters, the 2nd Lancashire Fusiliers, and the 2nd Essex held firmly on
until the afternoon under very heavy and incessant fire, while the 11th Brigade
upon their right were equally involved in the fight. Two battalions of the 10th
Brigade (Haldane's), the 1st Irish Fusiliers and 2nd Seaforths, had dug
themselves in on the high ground just north of Selvigny and repulsed every
attack, but two others, the 2nd Dublins and 1st Warwicks, had got involved with
the 12th Brigade and could not be retrieved. The Signal Corps had not yet
arrived, and the result was that General Snow had the greatest difficulty in
ensuring his connections with his brigadiers, the orders being carried by his
staff officers. At two o'clock, as there was a lull in the German advance,
Wilson of the 12th Brigade made a spirited counter-attack, recovering many of
the wounded, but being finally driven back to the old position by intense
artillery and machine-gun fire.</p>
<p>It is worth recording that during this advance the Essex men found among the
German dead many Jaeger with the same Gibraltar badge upon their caps which
they bore themselves. It was a Hanoverian battalion who had been comrades with
the old 56th in the defence of the fortress one hundred and fifty years
before.</p>
<p>The 11th Brigade (Hunter-Weston), on the right of the 12th, had meanwhile
played a very vital part in the fight. This brigade was defending a position
called Les Carri&egrave;res, or the quarry pits, which was east of Fontaine and
to the north of the village of Ligny. It was a desperate business, for the
British were four times driven out of it and four times came back to their
bitter work amid a sleet of shells and bullets. Parties of the 1st Somersets
and of the 1st East Lancashires held the quarries with the 1st Hants and 1st
Rifle Brigade in immediate support, all being eventually drawn into the fight.
Major Rickman, of the latter regiment, distinguished himself greatly in the
defence, but was seriously wounded and left behind in the final retirement.
Besides incessant gun-fire, the defenders were under infantry fire of a very
murderous description from both flanks. In spite of this, the place was held
for six hours until the retirement of the line in the afternoon caused it to be
untenable, as the enemy was able to get behind it. The brigade then fell back
upon Ligny under heavy shrapnel-fire, moving steadily and in good order. The
Germans at once attacked the village from the east and north-east. Could they
have taken it, they would have been upon the flank of the British line of
retirement. They were twice driven back, however, by the fire of the infantry,
losing very heavily upon both occasions. About four o'clock, the Army being in
full retreat, the brigade received orders to abandon Ligny and march upon
Malincourt. The effect of a heavy shrapnel-fire was minimised by this movement
being carried out in small columns of fours. A loss of 30 officers and 1115 men
in a single day's fighting showed how severe had been the work of Hunter-
Weston's brigade. The 12th Brigade had also lost about a thousand men. Many of
the guns had run short of shells. A spectator has described how he saw the
British gunners under a heavy fire, sitting in gloomy groups round the guns
which they had neither the shells to work, nor the heart to abandon.</p>
<p>Such was the general fortune of the British left. At the extreme edge of it,
in the gap between the left of the Fourth Division and the town of Cambrai,
Sordet's French cavalry had been fighting to prevent the British wing from
being turned. There was some misconception upon this point at the time, but in
justice to our Ally it should be known that General Smith-Dorrien himself
galloped to this flank in the course of the afternoon and was a witness of the
efforts of the French troopers, who had actually marched 40 miles in order to
be present at the battle.</p>
<p>The narrative has now taken the movements of the left wing up to the point
of its retirement, in order to preserve the continuity of events in that
portion of the field, but the actual abandonment of their position by Snow's
Fourth Division was due to circumstances over which they had no control, and
which had occurred at a considerable distance. Both the centre and the left of
the Army could have held its own, though it must be admitted that the attack to
which they were exposed was a very violent one gallantly pushed home.</p>
<p>All might have gone well had the Germans not been able to mass such an
overpowering artillery attack upon the right of the line. It was shortly after
mid-day that this part of the position began to weaken, and observers from the
centre saw stragglers retiring over the low hill in the Le Cateau direction. At
that hour the artillery upon the right of the British line was mostly silenced,
and large masses of the German infantry were observed moving round the right
flank. The salient of the Suffolks was in the possession of the enemy, and from
it they could enfilade the line. It was no longer possible to bring up
ammunition or horses to the few remaining guns. The greater part of the troops
held on none the less most doggedly to their positions, A steady downpour of
rain was a help rather than a discomfort, as it enabled the men to moisten
their parched lips. But the situation of the Fifth Division was growing
desperate. It was plain that to remain where they were could only mean
destruction. And yet to ask the exhausted men to retire under such a rain of
shells would be a dangerous operation. Even the best troops may reach their
snapping point. Most of them had by the afternoon been under constant
shrapnel-fire for eight hours on end. Some were visibly weakening. Anxious
officers looked eagerly over their shoulders for any sign of reinforcement, but
an impassable gap separated them from their comrades of the First Army Corps,
who were listening with sinking hearts to the rumble of the distant cannonade.
There was nothing for it but to chance the retirement. About three o'clock
commanders called to officers and officers to men for a last great effort. It
was the moment when a leader reaps in war the love and confidence which he has
sown in peace. Smith-Dorrien had sent his meagre reserve, which consisted of
one battery and two battalions, to take up a rearguard position astride the Le
Cateau-St. Quentin road. Every available detail, that could pull a trigger,
down to Hildebrand's signallers of the Headquarters Staff, who had already done
wonderful work in their own particular line, were thrust into the covering
line. One by one the dishevelled brigades were drawn off towards the south. One
section of the heavy guns of the 108th Heavy Battery was ordered back to act
with two battalions of the 19th Brigade in covering the Reumont-Maritz road,
while the 1st Norfolks were put in echelon behind the right flank for the same
purpose.</p>
<p>The Fifth Division, with the 15th Brigade as rearguard, considerably
disorganised by its long hammering, retreated along the straight Roman road via
Maritz and Estr&eacute;es. The Third Division fell back The through Berthy and
Clary to Beaurevoir, the 9th Brigade forming a rearguard. The cavalry, greatly
British helped by Sordet's French cavalry upon the west, flung itself in front
of the pursuit, while the guns sacrificed themselves to save the retiring
infantry. Every British battery was an inferno of bursting shells, and yet
every one fought on while breech-block would shut or gunner could stand. Many
batteries were in the state of the 61st R.F.A., which fired away all its own
shells and then borrowed from the limbers of other neighbouring batteries, the
guns of which had been put out of action. Had the artillery gone the Army would
have gone. Had the Army gone the Germans had a clear run into Paris. It has
been said that on the covering batteries of Wing, Milne, and Headlam may, on
that wet August afternoon, have hung the future history of Europe.</p>
<p>Wing's command included the 23rd, 30th, 40th, and 42nd Brigades, with the
48th Heavy Battery; Headlam's were the 15th, 27th, 28th, and 8th, with the
108th Heavy; Milne's, the 14th, 29th, 32nd, and 37th, with the 31st Heavy.
These numbers deserve to be recorded, for every gun of them did great service,
though many were left in ruins on the field. Some, like those of the 37th
R.F.A., were plucked from under the very noses of the Germans, who were within
a hundred yards of them when they were withdrawn, a deed of valour for which
Captain Reynolds of that battery received the Cross. One by one those batteries
which could move were drawn off, the cavalry covering the manoeuvre by their
rifle-fire, and sometimes man-handling the gun from the field. Serving one day
as charging cavaliers, another as mounted infantry in covering a retreat, again
as sappers in making or holding a trench, or when occasion called for it as
gun-teams to pull on the trace of a derelict gun, the cavalry have been the
general utility men of the Army. The days of pure cavalry may have passed, but
there will never be a time when a brave and handy fighting man who is mobile
will not be invaluable to his comrades.</p>
<p>It was about four o'clock that the Fourth Division, on the left flank, who
had been maintaining the successful defensive already described, were ordered
to begin their retirement. The 12th Brigade was able to withdraw with no great
difficulty along the line Walincourt-Villiers-Vendhuile, reaching the latter
village about nine-thirty. The doings of the 11th Brigade have been already
described. There was considerable disintegration but no loss of spirit. One of
the regiments of the 12th, the 2nd Royal Lancasters, together with about three
hundred Warwicks, from the 10th Brigade, and some detachments of other
regiments, were by some mischance, isolated in the village of Haucourt with no
definite orders, and held on until ten o'clock at night, when the place was
nearly surrounded. They fought their way out, however, in a most surprising
fashion, and eventually made good their retreat. One party, under Major Poole
of the Warwicks, rejoined the Army next day. Captain Clutterbuck, with a small
party of Royal Lancasters, wandered into Haumont after it was occupied by the
Germans. Summoned to surrender the gallant officer refused, and was shot dead,
but his men charged with the bayonet and fought their way clear to a post which
was held by Major Parker of the same regiment, to the immediate south of the
village. This officer, finding that he was the last rearguard, withdrew in the
face of heavy German forces. Being joined by Major Christie of the Warwicks
with 200 men, they followed the Army, and, finally, by a mixture of good luck
and good leadership, picked their way through the German advance guards, and on
the third day rejoined the colours at Noyon.</p>
<p>Haldane's 10th Brigade had got split up during the confused fighting of the
day, half of it, the 1st Warwicks and 2nd Dublins, getting involved with the
12th Brigade in the fighting on the Haucourt Ridge. The other two battalions,
the 2nd Seaforths and 1st Royal Irish Fusiliers, kept guard as a reserve over
the left flank of the division. Towards evening General Haldane, finding it
hopeless to recover control of his lost regiments, collected the rest of his
brigade, and endeavoured to follow the general line of retreat. He lost touch
with the remainder of the Army, and might well have been cut off, but after a
most exhausting experience he succeeded in safely rejoining the division at
Roisel upon the 27th. It may be said generally that the reassembling of the
Fourth Division after the disintegration they had experienced was a remarkable
example of individualism and determination.</p>
<p>It is impossible to doubt that the Germans, in spite of their preponderating
numbers, were staggered by the resistance which they had encountered. In no
other way can one explain the fact that their pursuit, which for three days had
been incessant, should now, at the most critical instant, have eased off. The
cavalry and guns staved off the final blow, and the stricken infantry staggered
from the field. The strain upon the infantry of the Fifth Division may be
gathered from the fact that up to this point they had lost, roughly, 143
officers, while the Third Division had lost 92 and the Fourth 70. For the time
they were disorganised as bodies, even while they preserved their morale as
individuals.</p>
<p>When extended formations are drawn rapidly in under the conditions of a
heavy action, it is often impossible to convey the orders to men in outlying
positions. Staying in their trenches and unconscious of the departure of their
comrades, they are sometimes gathered up by the advancing enemy, but more
frequently fall into the ranks of some other corps, and remain for days or
weeks away from their own battalion, turning up long after they have helped to
swell some list of casualties. Regiments get intermingled and pour along the
roads in a confusion which might suggest a rout, whilst each single soldier is
actually doing his best to recover his corps. It is disorganisation&mdash;but
not demoralisation.</p>
<p>It has been remarked above that in the widespread formations of modern
battles it is difficult to be sure of the transmission of orders. An
illustration of such a danger occurred upon this occasion, which gave rise to
an aftermath of battle nearly as disastrous as the battle itself. This was the
episode which culminated in the loss of a body of troops, including a large
portion of the 1st Gordon Highlanders. This distinguished corps had been
engaged with the rest of Beauchamp Doran's 8th Brigade at Mons and again upon
the following day, after which they retreated with the rest of their division.
On the evening of the 25th they bivouacked in the village of Audencourt, just
south of the Cambrai&mdash;Le Cateau highway, and on the morning of the 26th
they found themselves defending a line of trenches in front of this village.
From nine o'clock the Gordons held their ground against a persistent German
attack. About 3:30 an order was given for the battalion to retire. This message
only reached one company, which acted upon it, but the messenger was wounded en
route, and failed to reach battalion headquarters. Consequently the remainder
of the battalion did not retire with the Army, but continued to hold its
trenches, greatly helped by the flank (D) Company of Royal Scots, until long
after nightfall, when the enemy in great force had worked round both of its
flanks. It should be understood that the withdrawal of the Royal Scots was
under direct order emanating from brigade headquarters, but an officer of the
Gordons, not knowing that such an order had been issued, and perceiving that
their flank would be exposed if D Company left their trench, said a few words
to them which had such an effect upon their fiery souls that they rushed back
to stand by the Highlanders, their Captain being shot dead as he waved his men
back into their trench. From that time onwards this company of Royal Scots,
finely led by two young lieutenants, Graves and Graham Watson, shared all the
dangers and the ultimate fate of the Gordons, as did a handful of Royal Irish
upon the other flank. When it was dusk it became clear to Colonel Gordon, who
was now in command of the mixed detachment, that he and his men were separated
from the Army and surrounded on every side by the advancing Germans. At that
time the men, after supreme exertion for several days, had been in action for
twelve hours on end. He therefore decided, as against annihilation in the
morning, that retreat was the only course open. The wounded were left in the
trenches. The transport, machine-guns, and horses had already been destroyed by
the incessant shelling. The detachment made a move towards the south, the
operation being a most difficult one in pitch darkness with the enemy within a
few hundred yards. The success attained in this initial stage was largely due
to the way in which the Master of Saltoim conveyed the orders which drew in the
flanks to the centre. Having made good the Audencourt-Caudry road at 1 A.M. on
August 27, the troops managed to traverse some miles of road, with blazing
villages all about them, and had a fair chance of reaching safety when
unfortunately at Montigny they took a wrong turn, which brought them into
Bertry which was held by the Germans. Some confusion was caused by the latter
challenging in French. A confused fight followed in the darkness, in the course
of which many individual acts of great bravery and devotion were performed. The
enemy were now all round the Highlanders, and though the struggle continued for
fifty minutes, and there was no official surrender, the little body of men was
embedded in Von Kluck's army, and no escape could be found. The utmost
discipline and gallantry were shown by all ranks. It must be some consolation
to the survivors to know that it is freely admitted that their resistance in
the trenches for so long a period undoubtedly facilitated the safe withdrawal
of the Third, and to some extent of the Fourth Divisions. Major Leslie Butler,
Brigade-Major of the 8th Brigade, who had made a gallant effort to ride to the
Gordons and warn them of their danger, was entangled among the Germans, and
only succeeded six days later in regaining the British lines.</p>
<p>So ended the perilous, costly, and almost disastrous action of Le Cateau.
The loss to the British Army, so far as it can be extracted from complex
figures and separated from the other losses of the retreat, amounted to between
seven and eight thousand killed, wounded, and missing, while at the time of the
action, or in the immediate retreat, a considerable quantity of transport and
thirty-six field-pieces, mostly in splinters, were abandoned to the enemy. It
was an action which could hardly have been avoided, and from which the troops
were extricated on better terms than might have been expected. It will always
remain an interesting academic question what would have occurred had it been
possible for the First Corps to line up with the rest of the Army. The enemy's
preponderance of artillery would probably have prevented a British victory, and
the strategic position would in any case have made it a barren one, but at
least the Germans would have been hard hit and the subsequent retreat more
leisurely. As it stood, it was an engagement upon which the weaker side can
look back without shame or dishonour. One result of it was to give both the
Army and the country increased confidence in themselves and then: leaders. Sir
John French has testified to the splendid qualities shown by the troops, while
his whole-hearted tribute to Smith-Dorrien, in which he said, "The saving of
the left wing of the Army could never have been accomplished unless a commander
of rare and unusual coolness, intrepidity, and determination had been Chapter
present to personally conduct the operation," will surely be endorsed by
history.</p>
<p>It is difficult to exaggerate the strain which had been thrown upon this
commander. On him had fallen the immediate direction of the action at Mons; on
him also had been the incessant responsibility of the retreat. He had, as has
been shown in the narrative, been hard at work all night upon the eve of the
battle; he superintended that trying engagement, he extricated his forces, and
finally motored to St. Quentin in the evening, went on to Noyon, reached it
after midnight, and was back with his Army in the morning, encouraging every
one by the magnetism of his presence. It was a very remarkable feat of
endurance.</p>
<p>Exhausted as the troops were, there could be no halt or rest until they had
extricated themselves from the immediate danger. At the last point of human
endurance they still staggered on through the evening and the night time, amid
roaring thunder and flashing lightning, down the St. Quentin road. Many fell
from fatigue, and having fallen, continued to sleep in ditches by the roadside,
oblivious of the racket around them. A number never woke until they found
themselves in the hands of the Uhlan patrols. Others slumbered until their
corps had disappeared, and then, regaining their senses, joined with other
straggling units so as to form bands, which wandered over the country, and
eventually reached the railway line about Amiens with wondrous Bill Adams tales
of personal adventures which in time reached England, and gave the impression
of complete disaster. But the main body were, as a matter of fact, holding well
together, though the units of infantry had become considerably mixed and so
reduced that at least four brigades, after less than a week of war, had lost 50
per cent of their personnel. Many of the men threw away the heavier contents of
their packs, and others abandoned the packs themselves, so that the pursuing
Germans had every evidence of a rout before their eyes. It was deplorable that
equipment should be discarded, but often it was the only possible thing to do,
for either the man had to be sacrificed or the pack. Advantage was taken of a
forked road to station an officer there who called out, "Third Division right.
Fifth Division left," which greatly helped the reorganisation. The troops
snatched a few hours of rest at St. Quentin, and then in the breaking dawn
pushed upon their weary road once more, country carts being in many cases
commandeered to carry the lame and often bootless infantry. The paved
chauss&eacute;es, with their uneven stones, knocked the feet to pieces, and
caused much distress to the tired men, which was increased by the extreme heat
of the weather.</p>
<p>In the case of some of the men the collapse was so complete that it was
almost impossible to get them on. Major Tom Bridges, of the 4th Royal Irish
Dragoons, being sent to round up and hurry forward 250 stragglers at St.
Quentin, found them nearly comatose with fatigue. With quick wit he bought a
toy drum, and, accompanied by a man with a penny whistle, he fell them in and
marched them, laughing in all their misery, down the high road towards Ham.
When he stopped he found that his strange following stopped also, so he was
compelled to march and play the whole way to Roupy. Thus by one man's
compelling personality 250 men were saved for the Army. But such complete
collapse was rare. The men kept their morale. "Beneath the dirt and grime and
weariness I saw clear eyes and grim jaws even when the men could hardly walk."
So spoke Coleman, the gallant American volunteer.</p>
<p>Up to now nothing had been seen of the French infantry, and the exposed
British force had been hustled and harried by Von Kluck's great army without
receiving any substantial support. This was through no want of loyalty, but our
gallant Allies were themselves hard pressed. Sir John French had sent urgent
representations, especially to General Sordet, the leader of the cavalry
operating upon the western side, and he had, as already shown, done what he
could to screen Smith-Dorrien's flank. Now at last the retiring Army was coming
in touch with those supports which were so badly needed. But before they were
reached, on the morning of the 27th, the Germans had again driven in the
rearguard of the First Corps.</p>
<p>Some delay in starting had been caused by the fact that only one road was
available for the whole of the transport, which had to be sent on in advance.
Hence the rearguard was exposed to increased pressure. This rearguard consisted
of the 1st Brigade. The 2nd Munsters were the right battalion. Then came the
1st Coldstream, the 1st Scots Guards, and the 1st Black Watch in reserve. The
front of the Munsters, as it faced round to hold back the too pushful Germans,
was from the north of Fesmy to Chapeau Rouge, but Major Charrier, who was in
command, finding no French at Bergues, as he had been led to expect, sent B and
D Companies of Munsters with one troop of the 15th Hussars to hold the
cross-roads near that place. At about 12:30 a message reached Major Charrier to
the effect that when ordered to retire he should fall back on a certain line
and act as flank-guard to the brigade. He was not to withdraw his two companies
from Chapeau Rouge until ordered. The Germans were already in force right on
the top of the Irishmen, the country being a broken one with high hedges which
restricted the field of fire. A section of guns of the 118th R.F.A. were served
from the road about fifty yards behind the line of the infantry. A desperate
struggle ensued, in the course of which the Munsters, suffering heavily,
overlapped on each flank, and utterly outnumbered, held on bravely in the hope
of help from the rest of the brigade. They did not know that a message had
already been dispatched to them to the effect that they should come on, and
that the other regiments had already done so. Still waiting for the orders
which never came, they fell back slowly through Fesmy before the attack, until
held up at a small village called Etreux, where the Germans cut off their
retreat. Meanwhile the Brigadier, hearing that the Munsters were in trouble,
gave orders that the Coldstream should reinforce them. It was too late,
however. At Oisy Bridge the Guards picked up sixty men, survivors of C Company.
It was here at Oisy Bridge that the missing order was delivered at 3 P.M., the
cycle orderly having been held up on his way. As there was no longer any sound
of fixing, the Coldstream and remnant of Munsters retired, being joined some
miles back by an officer and some seventy men. Together with the transport
guard this brought the total survivors of that fine regiment to 5 officers and
206 men. All the rest had fought to the end and were killed, wounded, or
captured, after a most desperate resistance, in which they were shot down at
close quarters, making repeated efforts to pierce the strong German force at
&Eacute;treux. To their fine work and that of the two lost guns and of a party
of the 15th Hussars, under Lieutenant Nicholson, who covered the retreat it may
have been due that the pursuit of the First Corps by the Germans from this
moment sensibly relaxed. Nine gallant Irish officers were buried that night in
a common grave. Major Charrier was twice wounded, but continued to lead his men
until a third bullet struck him dead, and deprived the Army of a soldier whose
career promised to be a brilliant one. Among others who fell was Lieutenant
Chute, whose masterly handling of a machine-gun stemmed again and again the
tide of the German attack. One of the most vivid recollections of the survivors
was of this officer lying on his face in six inches of water&mdash;for the
action was partly fought in tropical rain&mdash;and declaring that he was
having "the time of his life." The morale both of this disaster and that of the
Gordons must be the importance of sending a message in duplicate, or even in
triplicate, where the withdrawal of a regiment is concerned. This, no doubt, is
a counsel of perfection under practical conditions, but the ideal still
remains.</p>
<p>During the retreat of the First Corps its rear and a cavalry right flank had
been covered by the 5th Cavalry Brigade (Chetwode). On August 28 the corps was
continuing its march towards La F&egrave;re and the cavalry found itself near
Cerizy. At this point the pursuing German horsemen came into touch with it. At
about five in the afternoon, three squadrons of the enemy advanced upon one
squadron of the Scots Greys, which had the support of J Battery. Being fired
at, the Germans dismounted and attempted to advance upon foot, but the fire was
so heavy that they could make no progress and their led horses stampeded. They
retired, still on foot, followed up by a squadron of the 12th Lancers on their
flank. The remainder of the 12th Lancers, supported by the Greys, rode into the
dismounted dragoons with sword and lance, killing or wounding nearly all of
them. A section of guns had fired over the heads of the British cavalry during
the advance into a supporting body of German cavalry, who retired, leaving many
dead behind them. The whole hostile force retreated northwards, while the
British cavalry continued to conform to the movements of the First Corps. In
this spirited little action the German regiment engaged was, by the irony of
fate, the 1st Guard Dragoons, Queen Victoria's Own. The British lost 43 killed
and wounded. Among the dead were Major Swetenham and Captain Michell of the
12th Lancers. Colonel Wormald of the same regiment was wounded. The excited
troopers rode back triumphantly between the guns of J Battery, the cavalrymen
exchanging cheers with the horse-gunners as they passed, and brandishing their
blood-stained weapons.</p>
<p>On the evening before this brisk skirmish, the flank-guards of the British
saw a considerable body of troops in dark clothing upon their left, and shortly
afterwards perceived the shell-bursts of a rapid and effective fire over the
pursuing German batteries. It was the first contact with the advancing French.
These men consisted of the Sixty-first and Sixty-second French Reserve
Divisions, and were the van of a considerable army under General D'Amade. From
that moment the British forces were at last enabled, after a week of constant
marching, covering sometimes a good thirty miles a day, and four days of
continual fighting against extreme odds, to feel that they had reached a zone
of comparative quiet.</p>
<p>The German cavalry still followed the Army upon its southerly march, but
there was no longer any fear of a disaster, for the main body of the Army was
unbroken, and the soldiers were rather exasperated than depressed by their
experience. On the Friday and Saturday, however, August 28 and 29, considerable
crowds of stragglers and fugitives, weary and often weaponless, appeared upon
the lines of communication, causing the utmost consternation by their stories
and their appearance. Few who endured the mental anxiety caused in Great
Britain by the messages of Sunday, August 30, are likely to forget it. The
reports gave an enormous stimulus to recruiting, and it is worthy of record and
remembrance that, in the dark week which followed before the true situation was
clearly discerned, every successive day brought as many recruits to the
standards as are usually gained in a year. Such was the rush of men that the
authorities, with their many preoccupations, found it very difficult to deal
with them. A considerable amount of hardship and discomfort was the result,
which was endured with good humour until it could be remedied. It is to be
noted in this connection that it was want of arms which held back the new
armies. He who compares the empty arsenals of Britain with the huge extensions
of Krupp's, undertaken during the years before the war, will find the final
proof as to which Power deliberately planned it.</p>
<p>To return to the fortunes of the men retreating from Le Cateau, the colonels
and brigadiers had managed to make order out of what was approaching to chaos
on the day that the troops left St. Quentin. The feet of many were so cut and
bleeding that they could no longer limp along, so some were packed into a few
trains available and others were hoisted on to limbers, guns, wagons, or
anything with wheels, some carts being lightened of ammunition or stores to
make room for helpless men. In many cases the whole kits of the officers were
deliberately sacrificed. Many men were delirious from exhaustion and incapable
of understanding an order. By the evening of the 27th the main body of the
troops were already fifteen miles south of the Somme river and canal, on the
line Nesle&mdash;Ham&mdash;Flavy. All day there was distant shelling from the
pursuers, who sent their artillery freely forward with their cavalry.</p>

<p class="caption">Line of Retreat from Mons</p>
<br>
<p>On the 28th the Army continued its retreat to the line of the Oise near
Noyon. Already the troops were re-forming, and had largely recovered their
spirits, being much reassured by the declarations of the officers that the
retreat was strategic to get them in line with the French, and that they would
soon turn their faces northwards once more. As an instance of reorganisation it
was observed that the survivors of a brigade of artillery which had left its
horses and guns at Le Cateau still marched together as a single disciplined
unit among the infantry. All day the enemy's horse artillery, cavalry, and
motor-infantry hung on the skirts of the British, but were unable to make much
impression. The work of the Staff was excellent, for it is on record that many
of them had not averaged two hours' sleep in the twenty-four for over a week.
the Army.</p>
<p>On the next day, the 29th, the remainder of the Army got across the Oise,
but the enemy's advance was so close that the British cavalry was continually
engaged. Gough's 3rd Cavalry Brigade made several charges in the neighbourhood
of Plessis, losing a number of men but stalling off the pursuit and dispersing
the famous Uhlans of the Guard. On this day General Pulteney and his staff
arrived to take command of the Third Army Corps, which still consisted only of
the Fourth Division (Snow) with the semi-independent 19th Infantry Brigade, now
commanded by Colonel Ward, of the 1st Middlesex. It was nearly three weeks
later before the Third Corps was made complete.</p>
<p>There had been, as already mentioned, a French advance of four corps in the
St. Quentin direction, which fought a brave covering action, and so helped to
relieve the pressure upon the British. It cannot be denied that there was a
feeling among the latter that they had been unduly exposed, being placed in so
advanced a position and having their flank stripped suddenly bare in the
presence of the main German army. General Joffre must have recognised that this
feeling existed and that it was not unreasonable, for he came to a meeting on
this day at the old Napoleonic Palace at Compi&egrave;gne, at which Sir John
French, with Generals Haig, Smith-Dorrien, and Allenby, was present. It was an
assemblage of weary, overwrought men, and yet of men who had strength enough of
mind and sufficient sense of justice to realise that whatever weight had been
thrown upon them, there was even more upon the great French engineer, whose
spirit hovered over the whole line from Verdun to Amiens. Each man left the
room more confident of the immediate future. Shortly afterwards Joffre issued
his kindly recognition of the work done by his Allies, admitting in the most
handsome fashion that the flank of the long French line of armies had been
saved by the hard fighting and self-sacrifice of the British Army.</p>
<p>On August 30, the whole Army having crossed the Oise, the bridges over that
river were destroyed, an operation which was performed under a heavy shell
fire, and cost the lives of several sapper officers and men. No words can
exaggerate what the Army owed to Wilson's sappers of the 56th and 57th Field
Companies and 3rd Signal Company, as also to Tulloch's, of the 17th and 59th
Companies and 5th Signal Company, whose work was incessant, fearless, and
splendid.</p>
<p>The Army continued to fall back on the line of the Aisne, the general
direction being almost east and west through Cr&eacute;py-en-Valois. The
aeroplanes, which had conducted a fine service during the whole of the
operations, reported that the enemy was still coming rapidly on, and streaming
southwards in the Compi&egrave;gne direction. That they were in touch was shown
in dramatic fashion upon the early morning of September 1. The epic in question
deserves to be told somewhat fully, as being one of those incidents which are
mere details in the history of a campaign, and yet may live as permanent
inspirations in the life of an army.</p>
<p>The 1st Cavalry Brigade, greatly exhausted after screening the retreat so
long, was encamped near N&eacute;ry, to the south of Compi&egrave;gne, the
bivouac being a somewhat extended one. Two units were close to each other and
to the brigade headquarters of General Briggs. These were the hard-worked 2nd
Dragoon Guards (the Bays) and L Battery of Horse Artillery. Reveille was at
four o'clock, and shortly after that hour both troopers and gunners were busy
in leading their horses to water. It was a misty morning, and, peering through
the haze, an officer perceived that from the top of a low hill about seven
hundred yards away three mounted men were looking down upon them. They were the
observation officers of three four-gun German batteries. Before the British
could realise the situation the guns dashed up and came into action with
shrapnel at point-blank range. The whole twelve poured their fire into the
disordered bivouac before them. The slaughter and confusion were horrible.
Numbers of the horses and men were killed or wounded, and three of the guns
were dismounted. It was a most complete surprise, and promised to be an
absolute disaster. A body of German cavalry had escorted the guns, and their
rifles added to the volume of fire.</p>
<p>It is at such moments that the grand power of disciplined valour comes to
bring order out of chaos. Everything combined to make defence difficult
&mdash;the chilling hour of the morning, the suddenness of the attack, its
appalling severity, and the immediate loss of guns and men. A sunken road ran
behind the British position, and from the edge of this the dismounted
cavalrymen brought their rifles and their machine-gun into action. They
suffered heavily from the pelting gusts of shrapnel. Young Captain de
Crespigny, the gallant cadet of a gallant family, and many other good men were
beaten down by it. The sole hope lay in the guns. Three were utterly disabled.
There was a rush of officers and men to bring the other three into action.
Sclater-Booth, the major of the battery, and one lieutenant were already down.
Captain Bradbury took command and cheered on the men. Two of the guns were at
once put out of action, so all united to work the one that remained.</p>
<br>

"L Battery Action, September 1, 1914"></a></div>
<p class="caption">"L" Battery Action, September 1, 1914</p>
<br>
<p>What followed was Homeric. Lieutenant Giffard in rushing forward was hit in
four places. Bradbury's leg was shattered, but he lay beside the trail
encouraging the others and giving his directions. Lieutenant Mundy, standing
wide as observation officer, was mortally wounded. The limber could not be got
alongside and the shell had to be man-handled. In bringing it up Lieutenant
Campbell was shot. Immediately afterwards another shell burst over the gun,
killed the heroic Bradbury, and wounded Sergeant Dorell, Driver Osborne, and
Gunners Nelson and Derbyshire, the only remaining men. But the fight went on.
The bleeding men served the gun so long as they could move, Osborne and
Derbyshire crawling over with the shells while Nelson loaded and Dorell laid.
Osborne and Derbyshire fainted from loss of blood and lay between limber and
gun. But the fight went on. Dorell and Nelson, wounded and exhausted, crouched
behind the shield of the thirteen-pounder and kept up an incessant fire. Now it
was that the amazing fact became visible that all this devotion had not been in
vain. The cluster of Bays on the edge of the sunken road burst out into a
cheer, which was taken up by the staff, who, with General Briggs himself, had
come into the firing-line. Several of the German pieces had gone out of action.
The dying gun had wrought good work, as had the Maxim of the Bays in the hands
of Lieutenant Lamb. Some at least of its opponents had been silenced before the
two brave gunners could do no more, for their strength had gone with their
blood. Not only had the situation been saved, but victory had been assured.</p>
<p>About eight in the morning news of the perilous situation had reached the
19th Brigade. The 1st Middlesex, under Colonel Rowley, was hurried forward,
followed by the 1st Scottish Rifles. Marching rapidly upon the firing, after
the good old Maxim, the Middlesex found themselves in a position to command the
German batteries. After two minutes of rapid fire it was seen that the enemy
had left their guns. Eight guns were captured, two of them still loaded. About
a dozen German gunners lay dead or wounded round them. Twenty-five of the
escort were captured, as was an ambulance with some further prisoners a mile in
the rear. The cavalry, notably the 11th Hussars, endeavoured to follow up the
success, but soon found themselves in the presence of superior forces. New
wheels and new wheelers were found for the injured guns, and Battery L came
intact out of action&mdash;intact save for the brave acolytes who should serve
her no more. Bradbury, Nelson, and Doxell had the Victoria Cross, and never was
it better earned. The battery itself was recalled to England to refit and the
guns were changed for new ones. It is safe to say that for many a long year
these shrapnel-dinted thirteen-pounders will serve as a monument of one of
those deeds which, by their self-sacrifice and nobility, do something to
mitigate the squalors and horrors of war.</p>
<p>The success was gained at the cost of many valuable lives. Not only had the
personnel of the battery been destroyed, but the Bays lost heavily, and there
were some casualties among the rest of the brigade who had come up in support.
The 5th Dragoon Guards had 50 or 60 casualties, and lost its admirable
commander, Colonel Ansell, who was shot down in a flanking movement which he
had initiated. Major Cawley, of the staff, also fell. The total British loss
was not far short of 500 killed and wounded, but the Germans lost heavily also,
and were compelled to abandon their guns.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[ *The German cavalry were the Fourth Cavalry Division,
including the 2nd Cuirassiers, 9th Uhlans, 17th and 18th Dragoons. They
published in their losses for the "Combat of N&eacute;ry" 643 casualties. This
is not the complete loss, as the artillery does not seem to have been included.
]</p>
<p>The German advance guards were particularly active upon this day, September
1, the anniversary of Sedan. Although the Soissons Bridge had been destroyed
they had possession of another at Vic, and over this they poured in pursuit of
the First Corps, overtaking about 8 A.M. near Villars-Cotteret the rearguard,
consisting of the Irish Guards and the 2nd Coldstream. The whole of the 4th
Guards Brigade was drawn into the fight, which resolved itself into a huge
rifle duel amid thick woods, Scott-Kerr, their Brigadier, riding up and down
the firing line. The Guards retired slowly upon the 6th Infantry Brigade
(Davies), which was aided by Lushington's 41st Brigade of Artillery, just south
of Pisseleux. The Germans had brought up many guns, but could make no further
progress, and the British position was held until 6 P.M., when the rearguard
closed up with the rest of the Army. Lushington's guns had fought with no
infantry in front of them, and it was a matter of great difficulty in the end
to get them off, but it was accomplished by some very brilliant work under an
infernal fire. After this sharp action, in which Colonel Morris of the Irish
Guards lost his life, the retreat of the First Army Corps was not seriously
interfered with. The losses at that date in this corps amounted to 81 officers
and 2180 of all ranks.</p>
<p>So much attention is naturally drawn to the Second Army Corps, which both at
Mons and at Le Cateau had endured most of the actual fighting, that there is
some danger of the remarkable retreat effected by the First Corps having less
than its fair share of appreciation. The actual fighting was the least of the
difficulties. The danger of one or both flanks being exposed, the great
mobility of the enemy, the indifferent and limited roads, the want of rest, the
difficulty of getting food cooked, the consequent absolute exhaustion of the
men, and the mental depression combined to make it an operation of a most
trying character, throwing an enormous strain upon the judgment and energy of
General Haig. who so successfully brought his men intact and fit for service
into a zone of safety.</p>
<p>On the night of September 1, the First and Second Army Corps were in touch
once more at Betz, and were on the move again by 2 A.M. upon the 2nd. On this
morning the German advance was curiously interlocked with the British rear, and
four German guns were picked up by the cavalry near Ermenonville. They are
supposed to have been the remaining guns of the force which attacked Battery L
at N&eacute;ry. The movements of the troops during the day were much impeded by
the French refugees, who thronged every road in their flight before the German
terror. In spite of these obstructions, the rearward services of the
Army&mdash;Supply columns, ammunition columns, and medical transport&mdash;were
well conducted, and the admiration of all independent observers. The work of
all these departments had been greatly complicated by the fact that, as the
Channel ports were now practically undefended and German troops, making towards
the coast, had cut the main Calais-Boulogne line at Amiens, the base had been
moved farther south from Havre to St. Nazaire, which meant shifting seventy
thousand tons of stores and changing all arrangements. In spite of this the
supplies were admirable. It may safely be said that if there is one officer
more than another for whom the whole British Army felt a glow of gratitude, it
was for Sir William Robertson, the Chief of the Commissariat, who saw that the
fighting man was never without his rations. Greatly also did they appreciate
the work of his subordinates, who, wet or fine, through rainfall or shell-fall,
passed the food forward to the weary men at the front.</p>
<p>A difficult movement lay in front of the Army which had to cross the Marne,
involving a flank march in the face of the enemy. A retirement was still part
of the general French scheme of defence, and the British Army had to conform to
it, though it was exultantly whispered from officer to sergeant and from
sergeant to private that the turn of the tide was nearly due. On this day it
was first observed that the Germans, instead of pushing forward, were swinging
across to the east in the direction of Ch&acirc;teau-Thierry. This made the
task of the British a more easy one, and before evening they were south of the
Marne and had blown up the bridges. The movement of the Germans brought them
down to the river, but at a point some ten miles east of the British position.
They were reported to be crossing the river at La Fert&eacute;, and Sir John
French continued to fall back towards the Seine, moving after sundown, as the
heat had been for some days very exhausting. The troops halted in the
neighbourhood of Presles, and were cheered by the arrival of some small drafts,
numbering about 2000, a first installment towards refilling the great gaps in
the ranks, which at this date could not have been less than from 12,000 to
15,000 officers and men.</p>
<p>Here for a moment this narrative may be broken, since it has taken the Army
to the farthest point of its retreat and reached that moment of advance for
which every officer and man, from Sir John French to the drummer-boys, was
eagerly waiting. With their left flank resting upon the extreme outer forts of
Paris, the British troops had finally ended a retreat which will surely live in
military history as a remarkable example of an army retaining its cohesion and
courage in the presence of an overpowering adversary, who could never either
cut them off or break in their rearguard. The British Army was a small force
when compared with the giants of the Continent, but when tried by this supreme
test it is not mere national complacency for us to claim that it lived up to
its own highest traditions. "It was not to forts of steel and concrete that the
Allies owed their strength," said a German historian, writing of this phase of
the war, "but to the magnificent qualities of the British Army." We desire no
compliments at the expense of our brothers-in-arms, nor would they be just, but
at least so generous a sentence as this may be taken as an advance from that
contemptuous view of the British Army with which the campaign had begun.</p>
<p>Before finally leaving the consideration of this historical retreat, where a
small army successfully shook itself clear from the long and close pursuit of a
remarkably gallant, mobile, and numerous enemy, it may be helpful to give a
chronology of the events, that the reader may see their relation to each
other.</p>

OF THE MARNE</a></h2>
<p class="chaphead">The general situation&mdash;"Die grosse Zeit" &mdash; The
turn of the tide&mdash;The Battle of the Ourcq&mdash;The British
advance&mdash;Cavalry fighting&mdash;The 1st Lincolns and the guns &mdash;6th
Brigade's action at Hautvesnes&mdash;9th Brigade's capture of Germans at
Vinly&mdash;The problem of the Aisne&mdash;Why the Marne is one of the great
battles of all time</p>
<p class="first">THERE are several problems connected with the strategical
opening of the great war which will furnish food for debate among military
critics for many years come. One of these, already alluded to, is the French
offensive taken in Alsace and Lorraine. It ended in check in both cases, and
yet its ultimate effects in confusing the German plans and deflecting German
armies which might have been better used elsewhere may be held to justify the
French in their strategy.</p>
<p>Another remarkable and questionable move now obtrudes itself, this time upon
the part of the Germans. Very shortly after the outbreak of war, the Russians
had pushed their covering armies over the frontier of East Prussia, and had
defeated a German force at Gumbinnen, with a loss of prisoners and guns. A few
days later the left wing of the widespread, and as yet only partially
mobilised, Russian army struck heavily at the Austrians in the south near
Lemberg, where after a week of fighting they gained a great victory, with
prisoners, which amounted to over 70,000 men and a large booty of guns and
supplies. Before this blow had befallen their cause, and influenced only by the
fact that the Russian right wing was encroaching upon the sacred soil of the
Fatherland, a considerable force was detached from the invading armies in
France and dispatched to the Eastern front. These men were largely drawn from
the Third (Saxon) Army of Von Haussen. Such a withdrawal at such a time could
only mean that the German general staff considered that the situation in France
was assured, and that they had still sufficient means to carry on a victorious
invasion. Events were to show that they were utterly mistaken in their
calculation. It is true that, aided by these reinforcements, Von Hindenburg
succeeded on August 31 in inflicting a severe defeat upon the Russians at the
battle of Tannenberg, but subsequent events proved that such a victory could
have no decisive result, while the weakening of the armies in France may have
had a permanent effect upon the whole course of the war. At the very moment
that the Germans were withdrawing troops from their Western front the British
and French were doing all they could to thicken their own line of resistance,
especially by the transference of armies from Alsace and the south. Thus the
net result was that, whereas the Germans had up to August 25 a very marked
superiority in numbers, by the beginning of September the forces were more
equal. From that moment the chance of their taking Paris became steadily more
and more remote.</p>
<p>The first month of the war represented a very remarkable military
achievement upon the part of Germany. In her high state of preparation as
compared with the Allies, it was to be expected that the beginning of
hostilities would be all in her favour, but the reality exceeded what could
have been foreseen. Her great armies were ready to the last button. Up to the
eve of war the soldiers did not themselves know what their field uniform was
like. At the last moment two millions of men filed into the depots and emerged
in half an hour clad in grey, with new boots, equipment, and every possible
need for the campaign. On her artillery surprises she set special store, and
they were upon a vast scale. The machine-gun had been developed to an extent
unknown by other armies, and of these deadly little weapons it is certain that
very many thousands were available. From the tiny quick-firer, carried easily
by two men upon a stretcher, to the vast cannon with a diameter of
sixteen-and-a-half inches at the mouth, taking three railway trucks for its
majestic portage, every possible variety of man-killing engine was ready in
vast profusion. So, too, was the flying service, from the little Taube to the
huge six-hundred-foot Zeppelin. From these latter devices great results were
expected which were not destined to materialise, for, apart from
reconnaissances, they proved themselves to be machines rather for the murder of
non-combatants than for honest warfare.</p>
<p>Making every allowance for the huge advantage which the nation that
<i>knows</i> war is coming must always enjoy over those which merely fear that
it may come, it would be foolish to deny the vast military achievement of
Germany in the month of August. It reflects great credit upon the bravery and
energy of her troops, as well as upon the foresight of her organisers and the
capacity of her leaders. Though we are her enemies, our admiration would have
been whole-hearted were it not for the brutalities which marked her advance
both in Poland, in Belgium, and in France. Consider that wonderful panorama of
victory which was known all over the Fatherland as <i>"Die grosse Zeit,"</i> On
August 10 fell the great fortress of Li&egrave;ge, on the 22nd the great
fortress of Namur, early in September that of Maubeuge, while the smaller
strongholds went down as if they were open cities. On August 10 was a
considerable victory at M&uuml;lhausen, on the 20th the Belgians were defeated
at Tirlemont, on the same day Brussels was occupied. On the 22nd the French
central army of ten corps was defeated in a great battle near Charleroi,
losing, according to the Germans, some 20,000 prisoners and 200 guns. On the
left flank the Crown Prince's army won the battle of Longwy, taking 10,000
prisoners and many more guns. On August 23 the Duke of W&uuml;rtemberg won a
battle in the Ardennes. Upon the same date the British were driven from their
position at Mons. Upon the 26th they were defeated at Le Cateau. Most of
Belgium and the North of France were overrun. Scattered parties of Uhlans made
their way to the shores of the Atlantic spreading terror along the Channel
coast. The British bases were in such danger that they had to be moved.</p>
<p>Finally, upon the last day of the month, a great battle took place at
Tannenberg in East Prussia, in which the Russian invading army was almost
completely destroyed. I do not know where in history such a succession of
victories is to be found, and our horror of the atrocities of Louvain,
Aerschot, Dinard, and so many other places must not blind us to the superb
military achievement.</p>
<p>Marne. It was not, it is true, an unbroken series of successes &mdash; even
in the West. The French in the early days won a victory at Dornach in Alsace,
and another smaller one at Dinant in the Ardennes. They held the enemy in the
neighbourhood of Nancy, fought a fairly equal battle at St. Quentin in taking
the pressure off the British at the end of August, and had a success at Guise.
These, however, were small matters as compared with the sweeping tide of German
victory. But gradually the impetus of the rush was being stayed. Neither the
French nor the British lines were broken. They grew stronger from compression,
whilst the invaders grew weaker from diffusion. Even as they hoped to reach the
climax of their success, and the huge winning-post of the Eiffel Tower loomed
up before their racing armies, the dramatic moment arrived, and the dauntless,
high-hearted Allies had the reward of their constant, much-enduring valour.</p>
<p>September 6 was a day of great elation in the armies of the Allies, for it
marked the end of the retreat and the beginning of their victorious return. It
is clear that they could in no case have gone farther south without exposing
Paris to the danger of an attack. The French Government had already been
transferred to Bordeaux and the city put into a state which promised a long and
stubborn defence, but after the surprising rapidity of the capture of Namur
there was a general distrust of fortresses, and it was evident that if only one
or two of the outer ring of forts should be overwhelmed by the German fire, the
enemy would be in a position to do terrible damage to the city, even if they
failed to occupy it. The constant dropping of bombs from German aeroplanes, one
of which had already injured the Cathedral of N&ocirc;tre Dame, gave a sinister
forecast of the respect which the enemy was likely to show to the monuments of
antiquity.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the problem of investing Paris while the main French armies
remained unbeaten in the field proved to be an insuperable one. The first
German task, in accordance with the prophet Clausewitz, was to break the French
resistance. Everything would follow after that, and nothing could precede it.
Von Kluck, with his army, comprising originally something over 200,000 men, had
lost considerably in their conflicts with the British, and were much exhausted
by rapid marching, but they were still in good heart, as the roads over which
they passed seemed to offer ample evidence that their enemy was in full flight
before them. Knowing that they had hit the British hard, they hoped that, for a
time at least, they might disregard them, and, accordingly, they ventured to
close in, by a flank march, on to the other German armies to the east of them,
in order to combine against the main line of French resistance and to make up
the gaps of those corps which had been ordered to East Prussia. But the
bulldog, though weary and somewhat wounded, was still watching with bloodshot
eyes. He now sprang suddenly upon the exposed flank of his enemy and got a grip
which held firm for many a day to come.</p>
<p>Without going into complicated details of French strategy, which would be
outside the scope of this work, it may be generally stated that the whole
French line, which had stretched on August 22 from Namur along the line of the
Sambre to Charleroi and had retired with considerable loss before the German
advance, was now extended in seven separate armies from Verdun to the west of
Paris.</p>
<p>General Joffre had assembled Maunoury's Sixth Army, which consisted of the
Seventh Regular Corps, one reserve corps, and three territorial divisions, with
Sordet's cavalry, in the neighbourhood of Amiens, and at the end of the month
they lay with their right upon Roye. Thus, when Von Kluck swerved to his left,
this army was on the flank of the whole great German line which extended to
Verdun. Next to this Sixth Army and more to the south-east were the British,
now no longer unsupported, but with solid French comrades upon either side of
them. Next to the British, counting from the left or westward end of the
defensive line, was the Fifth French Army under General d'Esperey, of four
corps, with Conneau's cavalry forming the link between. These three great
bodies, the French Sixth, the British, and the French Fifth, were in touch
during the subsequent operations, and moved forward in close co-operation upon
September 6. Their operations were directed against the First (Von Kluck's) and
Second (Von B&uuml;low's) Armies. On the right of the Fifth French Army came
another extra, produced suddenly by the prolific Joffre and thrust into the
centre of the line. This was General Foch's Seventh, three corps strong, which
joined to the eastward General Langl&eacute; de Gary's Fourth Army. Opposed to
them were the remains of Von Haussen's Third Saxon Army and the Prince of
W&uuml;rtemberg's Fourth Army. Eastward of this, on the farther side of the
great plain of Chalons, a place of evil omen for the Huns, were the Third
(Sarrail), Second (Castelnau), and First (Dubail) French Armies, which faced
the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh German, commanded respectively by the Crown
Prince of Prussia, the Crown Prince of Bavaria, and General von Heeringen. Such
were the mighty lines which were destined to swing and sway for an eventful
week in the strain of a close-locked fight.</p>
<p>The eastern portion of this great battle is outside the scope of this
account, but it may briefly be stated that after murderous fighting neither the
French nor the German lines made any marked advance in the extreme east, but
that the Crown Prince's army was driven back by Dubail, Sarrail, and Castelnau
from all its advanced positions, and held off from Nancy and Verdun, which were
his objectives. It was at the western end of the Allied line that the
strategical position was most advantageous and the result most marked. In all
other parts of that huge line the parallel battle prevailed. Only in the west
were the Germans outflanked, and the shock of the impact of the Sixth French
Army passed down from Meaux to Verdun as the blow of the engine's buffer sends
the successive crashes along a line of trucks. This French army was, as already
stated, upon the extreme outside right of Von Kluck's army, divided from it
only by the River Ourcq. This was the deciding factor in the subsequent
operations.</p>
<p>By mid-day upon September 6, according to the dispatch of Sir John French,
the Germans had realised their dangerous position. The British Army, consisting
of five divisions and five cavalry brigades, with its depleted ranks filled up
with reinforcements and some of its lost guns replaced, was advancing from the
south through the forest of Crecy, men who had limped south with bleeding feet
at two miles an hour changing their gait to three or four now that they were
bound northward. The general movement of the Army cannot, however, be said to
have been rapid. Von Kluck had placed nothing more substantial than a cavalry
screen of two divisions in front of them, while he had detached a strong force
of infantry and artillery to fight a rearguard action against the Sixth French
Army and prevent it from crossing the Ourcq.</p>
<p>The desperate struggle of September 6, 7, 8, and 9 between Von Kluck and
Maunoury may be looked upon as the first turning-point of the war. Von Kluck
had originally faced Maunoury with his Fourth Reserve Corps on the defensive.
Recognising how critical it was that Maunoury should be crushed, he passed back
two more army corps&mdash;the Seventh and Second&mdash;across the Ourcq, and
fell upon the French with such violence that for two days it was impossible to
say which side would win. Maunoury and his men fought magnificently, and the
Germans showed equal valour. At one time the situation seemed desperate, but
20,000 men, odds and ends of every kind &mdash; Republican Guards, gendarmes,
and others&mdash;were rushed out from Paris in a five-mile line of automobiles,
and the action was restored. Only on the morning of the 10th did the Germans
withdraw in despair, held in their front by the brave Maunoury, and in danger
of being cut off by the British to the east of them.</p>
<p>The advance of the British upon September 6 was made in unison with that of
the Fifth French Army (D'Esperey's) upon the right, and was much facilitated by
the fact that Von Kluck had to detach the strong force already mentioned to
deal with Maunoury upon the left. The British advanced with the Fourth Division
upon the left, the Second Corps in the centre and the First Corps upon the
right. The high banks of the Grand Morin were occupied without serious
fighting, and the whole line pushed forward for a considerable distance,
halting on the Coulommiers-Maisoncelles front. The brunt of the fighting during
the day was borne by the French on either wing, the Third and Fourth German
Corps being thrown back by D'Esperey's men, among whom the Senegal regiments
particularly distinguished themselves. The fighting in this section of the
field continued far into the night.</p>

<br>
<p>On September 7 the British and the Fifth French were still moving
northwards, while the Sixth French were continuing their bitter struggle upon
the Ourcq. The British infantry losses were not heavy, though a hidden battery
cost the South Lancashires of the 7th Brigade forty-one casualties. Most of the
fighting depended upon the constant touch between the British cavalry and the
German. It was again the French armies upon each flank who did the hard work
during this eventful day, the first of the German retreat. The Sixth Army were
all day at close grips with Von Kluck, while the Fifth drove the enemy back to
the line of the Petit Morin River, carrying Vieux-Maisons at the point of the
bayonet. Foch's army, still farther to the east, was holding its own in a
desperate defensive battle.</p>
<p>Of the cavalry skirmishes upon this day one deserves some special record.
The 2nd Cavalry Brigade (De Lisle) was acting at the time as flank guard with,
the 9th Lancers in front. Coming into contact with some German dragoons near
the village of Moncel, there followed a face-to-face charge between two
squadrons, each riding through the Marne. other. The American, Coleman, who saw
the encounter, reckons the odds in numbers to have been two to one against the
Lancers. The British Colonel Campbell was wounded, and the adjutant, Captain
Reynolds, transfixed through the shoulder by a lance. While drawing the weapon
out Captain Allfrey was killed. The other casualties were slight, and those of
the German dragoons were considerably greater. This example of shock tactics
was almost instantly followed by an exhibition of those mounted rifleman
tactics which have been cultivated of late years. A squadron of the 18th
Hussars, having dismounted, was immediately charged by a German squadron in
close order. About 70 Germans charged, and 32 were picked up in front of the
dismounted Hussars, while the few who passed through the firing line were
destroyed by the horse-holders. It may fairly be argued that had the two
squadrons met with shock tactics, no such crushing effect could possibly have
been attained. It is interesting that in one morning two incidents should have
occurred which bore so directly upon the perennial dispute between the
partisans of the <i>arme blanche</i> and those of the rifle.</p>
<p>On the 8th the orders were to advance towards Ch&acirc;teau-Thierry and to
endeavour to reach the Marne. The Germans were retreating fast, but rather on
account of their generally faulty strategical position than from tactical
compulsion, and they covered themselves with continual rearguard actions,
especially along the line of the Petit Morin. It is one of the noticeable
results, however, of the use of aircraft that the bluff of a rearguard has
disappeared and that it is no longer possible to make such a retreat as
Mass&eacute;na from Torres Vedras, where the pursuer never knew if he were
striking at a substance or a shadow. Gough's Second Cavalry Division, which
consisted of the 3rd and 5th Brigades, swept along, and the infantry followed
hard at the heels of the horses, Doran's 8th Brigade suffering the loss of
about 100 men when held up at the crossing of the Petit Morin River near Orly,
which they traversed eventually under an effective covering fire from J
Battery, R.H.A.</p>
<p>The First Army Corps upon this day forced the Petit Morin at two places,
both near La Tr&eacute;toire, north of Rebaix. The First Division secured the
passage at Sablonni&egrave;res, where the Black Watch seized the heights,
causing the German rearguard some losses and taking 60 prisoners. The Second
Division met with considerable resistance, but the 2nd Worcesters got over at
Le Gravier and the 2nd Grenadier Guards at La Forge. The enemy was then driven
from the river bank into the woods, where they were practically surrounded and
had eventually to surrender. Eight machine-guns and 350 prisoners, many of them
from the Guards' Jaeger Battalion, were captured. Six of these machine-guns
fell to the Irish Guards.</p>
<p>The Second Army Corps passed the Petit Morin near St. Cyr and St. Ouen, the
13th Brigade attacking the former and the 14th the latter, both being villages
on the farther side of the river. Such fighting as there was in this quarter
came largely to the 1st East Surrey and 1st Cornwalls, of the 14th Brigade, but
the resistance was not great, and was broken by the artillery fire. To the
soldiers engaged the whole action was more like a route march with occasional
deployments than a battle.</p>
<p>On the 9th the Army was up to the Marne and was faced with the problem of
crossing it. The operations extending over many miles were unimportant in
detail, though of some consequence in the mass. The real hard fighting was
falling upon the Sixth French Army north of Ligny, which was still in desperate
conflict with the German right, and upon Foch's army, which was fighting
magnificently at F&egrave;re-Champenoise. The advance of the British, and their
own exertions, caused the Germans to retire and cleared the passage over the
Ourcq for our Allies. The chief losses during the day upon the British side
fell upon the Guards' Brigade, the 1st Lincolns, and the 1st Cornwalls, most of
which were inflicted by invisible quick-firing batteries shrouded by the woods
which flank the river. The latter regiment lost Colonel Turner, Major
Cornish-Bowden, and a number of other killed or wounded in a brilliant piece of
woodland fighting, where they drove in a strong German rearguard. The 1st East
Surrey, who were very forward in the movement, were also hard hit, having 6
officers and about 120 men out of action.</p>
<p>The British infantry was able on this day to show that woods may serve for
other purposes besides hiding batteries. The 1st Lincolns, being held up by a
rapid and accurate fire from invisible guns, dispatched two companies, C and D,
to make in single file a detour under the shelter of the trees. Coming behind
the battery, which appears to have had no immediate support, they poured in a
rapid fire at two hundred and fifty yards, which laid every man of the German
gunners upon the ground. The whole battery was captured. The casualties of the
Lincolns in this dashing exploit, which included Captains Hoskyns and Ellison,
with Lieutenant Thruston, were unavoidably caused by British shrapnel, our
gunners knowing nothing of the movement.</p>
<p>On this date (September 9) both the First and the Second Army Corps were
across the Marne, and advanced some miles to the north of it, killing,
wounding, or capturing many hundreds of the enemy. The Sixth French Army was,
as stated, fighting hard upon the Ourcq, but the Fifth had won a brilliant
success near Montmirail and driven the enemy completely over the river.</p>
<p>Pulteney's Third Corps, still a division short, had been held up by the
destruction of the bridges at La Fert&eacute;, but on September 10 they were
across and the whole Army sweeping northwards. The cavalry overrode all
resistance and rounded up a number of prisoners, over 2000 in all. It was a
strange reversal of fortune, for here within a fortnight were the same two
armies playing the converse parts, the British eagerly pushing on with a
flushed consciousness of victory, while the Germans, tired and dispirited,
scattered in groups among the woods or were gathered up from the roadsides. It
was a day of mist and rain, with muddy, sodden roads, but all weather is fine
weather to the army that is gaining ground. An impression of complete German
demoralisation became more widespread as transport, shells, and even guns were
found littering the high-roads, and yet there was really even less cause for it
than when the same delusion was held by the Germans. The enemy were actually
making a hurried but orderly retreat, and these signs of disaster were only the
evidence of a broken rearguard resistance. German armies do not readily
dissolve. There is no more cohesive force in the world. But they were
undoubtedly hard pressed.</p>
<p>About eight o'clock upon the morning of the 6th 10th the 6th Brigade
(Davies') observed a column of the enemy's infantry on a parallel road near the
village of Hautvesnes. Artillery fire was at once opened upon them, and a
vigorous infantry attack, the 1st Rifles advancing direct with the 1st
Berkshires on their right, whilst the 1st King's Liverpool worked round each
flank in Boer fashion. The 2nd Staffords were in support. The Germans had taken
refuge in a sunken road, but they were mercilessly lashed by shrapnel, and 400
of them ran forward with their hands up. The sunken road was filled with their
dead and wounded. Some hundreds streamed away across country, but these were
mostly gathered up by the Third Division on the left.</p>
<p>In this brisk little action the 50th R.F.A., and later the whole of the 34th
Brigade R.F.A., put in some fine work, the shrapnel-fire being most deadly and
accurate. The British had pushed their guns freely forward with their cavalry
and did much execution with them, though they had the misfortune on this same
date, the 10th, to lose, by the answering shell-fire of the enemy. General
Findlay, artillery commander of the First Division. In this second action, in
which the German rearguard, infantry as well as artillery, was engaged, the 2nd
Sussex Regiment, which was leading the First Division, sustained considerable
losses near Courchamps or Priez, as did the 1st Northamptons and the 1st North
Lancashires. Some 300 of Bulfin's 2nd Brigade were hit altogether, among whom
was Colonel Knight, of the North Lancashires. The enemy came under heavy fire,
both from the infantry and from the guns, so that their losses were
considerable, and several hundred of them were captured. The country was very
hilly, and the roads so bad that in the exhausted state of men and horses the
pursuit could not be sufficiently pressed. Thirty large motor cars were seen at
Priez in front of the 2nd Brigade, carrying the enemy's rearguard.</p>
<p>On this same date the 9th Brigade captured 600 German infantry, the
survivors of a battalion, at the village of Vinly. This seems to have been an
incident of the same character as the loss of the Cheshires or of the Munsters
in the British retreat, where a body of troops fighting a covering action was
left too long, or failed to receive the orders for its withdrawal. The defence
was by no means a desperate one, and few of the attacking infantry were killed
or wounded. On this date the Fifth and Sixth French Armies were hardly engaged
at all, and the whole Allied Force, including General Foch's Seventh French
Army on the right of the Fifth, were all sweeping along together in a single
rolling steel-crested wave, composed of at least twelve army corps, whilst nine
German corps (five of Von Kluck and four of B&uuml;low) retired swiftly before
them, hurrying towards the chance of re-forming and refitting which the Aisne
position would afford them.</p>
<p>On September 11 the British were still advancing upon a somewhat narrowed
front. There was no opposition and again the day bore a considerable crop of
prisoners and other trophies. The weather had become so foggy that the aircraft
were useless, and it is only when these wonderful scouters are precluded from
rising that a general realises how indispensable they have become to him. As a
wit expressed it, they have turned war from a game of cards into a game of
chess. It was still very wet, and the Army was exposed to considerable
privation, most of the officers and men having neither change of clothing,
overcoats, nor waterproof sheets, while the blowing up of bridges on the lines
of communication had made it impossible to supply the wants. The undefeatable
commissariat, however, was still working well, which means that the Army was
doing the same. On the 12th the pursuit was continued as far as the River
Aisne. Allenby's cavalry occupied Braine in the early morning, the Queen's Bays
being particularly active, but there was so much resistance that the Third
Division was needed to make the ground good. Gough's Cavalry Division also ran
into the enemy near Chassemy, killing or capturing several hundred of the
German infantry. In these operations Captain Stewart, whose experience as an
alleged spy has been mentioned, met with a soldier's death. On this day the
Sixth French Army was fighting a considerable action upon the British left in
the vicinity of Soissons. the Germans making a stand in order to give time for
their impedimenta to get over the river. In this they succeeded, so that when
the Allied Forces reached the Aisne, which is an unfordable stream some sixty
yards from bank to bank, the retiring army had got across it, had destroyed
most of the bridges, and showed every sign of being prepared to dispute the
crossing.</p>
<p>Missy Bridge, facing the Fifth Division, appeared at first to be intact, but
a daring reconnaissance by Lieutenant Pennecuick, of the Engineers, showed that
it was really badly damaged. Cond&eacute; Bridge was intact, but was so covered
by a high horse-shoe formation of hills upon the farther side that it could not
be used, and remained throughout under control of the enemy. Bourg Bridge,
however, in front of the First Army Corps, had for some unexplained reason been
left undamaged, and this was seized in the early morning of September 13 by De
Lisle's cavalry, followed rapidly by Bulfin's 2nd Brigade. It was on the face
of it a somewhat desperate enterprise which lay immediately in front of the
British general. If the enemy were still retreating he could not afford to
slacken his pursuit, while, on the other hand, if the enemy were merely making
a feint of resistance, then, at all hazards, the stream must be forced and the
rearguard driven in. The German infantry could be seen streaming up the roads
on the farther bank of the river, but there were no signs of what their next
disposition might be. Air reconnaissance was still precluded, and it was
impossible to say for certain which alternative might prove to be correct, but
Sir John French's cavalry training must incline him always to the braver
course. The officer who rode through the Boers to Kimberley and threw himself
with his weary men across the path of the formidable Kronje was not likely to
stand hesitating upon the banks of the Aisne. His personal opinion was that the
enemy meant to stand and fight, but none the less the order was given to
cross.</p>
<p>September 13 was spent in arranging this dashing and dangerous movement. The
British got across eventually in several places and by various devices.
Bulfin's men, followed by the rest of the First Division of Haig's Army Corps,
passed the canal bridge of Bourg with no loss or difficulty. The 11th Brigade
of Pulteney's Third Corps got across by a partially demolished bridge and ferry
at Venizel. They were followed by the 12th Brigade, who established themselves
near Bucy. The 13th Brigade was held up at Missy, but the 14th got across and
lined up with the men of the Third Corps in the neighbourhood of Ste.
Marguerite, meeting with a considerable resistance from the Germans. Later,
Count Gleichen's 15th Brigade also got across. On the right Hamilton got over
with two brigades of the Third Division, the 8th Brigade crossing on a single
plank at Vailly and the 9th using the railway bridge, while the whole of Haig's
First Corps had before evening got a footing upon the farther bank. So eager
was the advance and so inadequate the means that Haking's 5th Brigade, led by
the Connaught Rangers, was obliged to get over the broad and dangerous river,
walking in single file along the sloping girder of a ruined bridge, under a
heavy, though distant, shell-fire. The night of September 13 saw the main body
of the Army across the river, already conscious of a strong rearguard action,
but not yet aware that the whole German Army had halted and was turning at bay.
On the right De Lisle' s cavalrymen had pushed up the slope from Bourg Bridge
and reached as far as Vendresse, where they were pulled up by the German
lines.</p>
<p>It has been mentioned above that the 11th and 12th Brigades of the Fourth
Division had passed the river at Venizel. These troops were across in the early
afternoon, and they at once advanced, and proved that in that portion of the
field the enemy Maine. were Undoubtedly standing fast. The 11th Brigade, which
was more to the north, had only a constant shell-fall to endure, but the 12th,
pushing forward through Bucy-le-long, found itself in front of a line of woods
from which there swept a heavy machine-gun- and rifle-fire. The advance was
headed by the 2nd Lancashire Fusiliers, supported by the 2nd Inniskilling
Fusiliers. It was across open ground and under heavy fire, but it was admirably
carried out. In places where the machine-guns had got the exact range the
stricken Fusiliers lay dead or wounded with accurate intervals, like a
firing-line on a field day. The losses were heavy, especially in the Lancashire
Fusiliers. Colonel Griffin was wounded, and 5 of his officers with 250 men were
among the casualties. It should be recorded that fresh supplies of ammunition
were brought up at personal risk by Colonel Seely, late Minister of War, in his
motor-car. The contest continued until dusk, when the troops waited for the
battle of next day under such cover as they could find.</p>
<p>The crossing of the stream may be said, upon the one side, to mark the end
of the battle and pursuit of the Marne, while, on the other, it commenced that
interminable Battle of the Aisne which was destined to fulfil Bloch's
prophecies and to set the type of all great modern engagements. The prolonged
struggles of the Manchurian War had prepared men's minds for such a
development, but only here did it first assume its full proportions and warn us
that the battle of the future was to be the siege of the past. Men remembered
with a smile Bernhardi's confident assertion that a German battle would be
decided in one day, and that his countrymen would never be constrained to fight
in defensive trenches.</p>
<p>The moral effect of the Battle of the Marne was greater than its material
gains. The latter, so far as the British were concerned, did not exceed 5,000
prisoners, 20 guns, and a quantity of transport. The total losses, however,
were very heavy. The Germans had perfected a method of burning their dead with
the aid of petrol. These numerous holocausts over the country-side were found
afterwards by the peasants to have left mounds of charred animal matter which
were scattered by their industrious hands on the fields which they might help
to fertilise. The heat of cremation had dissolved the bones, but the teeth in
most cases remained intact, so that over an area of France it was no uncommon
thing to see them gleaming in the clods on either side of the new-cut furrow.
Had the ring of high-born German criminals who planned the war seen in some
apocalyptic vision the detailed results of their own villainy, it is hard to
doubt that even their hearts and consciences would have shrunk from the
deed.</p>
<p>Apart from the losses, the mere fact that a great German army had been
hustled across thirty miles of country, had been driven from river to river,
and had finally to take refuge in trenches in order to hold their ground, was a
great encouragement to the Allies. From that time they felt assured that with
anything like equal numbers they had an ascendancy over their opponents. Save
in the matter of heavy guns and machine-guns, there was not a single arm in
which they did not feel that they were the equals or the superiors. Nor could
they forget that this foe, whom they were driving in the open and holding in
the trenches, was one who had rushed into the war with men and material all
carefully prepared for this day of battle, while their own strength lay in the
future. If the present was bright, it would surely be incomparably brighter
when the reserves of France and the vast resources of the British Empire were
finally brought into line. There had never from the beginning been a doubt of
final victory, but from this time on it became less an opinion and more a
demonstrable and mathematical certainty.</p>
<p>The battle must also be regarded as a fixed point in military history, since
it was the first time since the days of the great Napoleon that a Prussian army
had been turned and driven. In three successive wars &mdash; against the Danes,
the Austrians, and the French&mdash;they had lived always in the warm sunshine
of success. Now, at last, came the first chill of disaster. Partly from their
excellent military qualities, but even more on account of their elaborate and
methodical preparations, joined with a want of scruple which allowed them to
force a war at the moment when they could take their adversary at a
disadvantage, they had established a legend of invincibility. This they left
behind them with their cannon and their prisoners between the Marne and the
Aisne. It had been feared that free men, trained in liberal and humane methods,
could never equal in military efficiency those who had passed through the
savage discipline which is the heritage of the methods that first made Prussia
great at the expense of her neighbours. This shadow was henceforth for Chapter
ever lifted from men's minds, and it was shown that the kindly comradeship
which exists in the Western armies between officers and men was not
incompatible with the finest fighting qualities of which any soldiers are
capable.</p>

OF THE AISNE</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE stretch of river which confronted the British Army when
they set about the hazardous crossing of Aisne was about fifteen miles in
length. It lay as nearly as possible east and west, so that the advance was
from south to north. As the British faced the hazardous river the First Army
Corps was on the right of their line, together with half the cavalry. In the
centre was the Second Corps, on the left the Third Corps, which was still
without one of its divisions (the Sixth), but retained, on the other hand, the
19th Brigade, which did not belong to it. Each of these British corps covered a
front of, roughly, five miles. Across the broad and swift river a considerable
German army with a powerful artillery was waiting to dispute the passage. On
the right of the British were the French Fifth and Seventh Armies, and on their
left, forming the extremity of the Allied line, was the French Sixth Army,
acting in such close co-operation with the British Third Corps in the Soissons
region that their guns were often turned upon the same point. This Sixth French
Army, with the British Army, may be looked upon as the left wing of the huge
Allied line which stretched away with many a curve and bend to the Swiss
frontier. During all this hurried retreat from the Marne, it is to be
remembered that the Eastern German armies had hardly moved at all. It was their
four armies of the right which had swung back like a closing door, the Crown
Prince's Fifth Army being the hinge upon which it turned. Now the door had
ceased to swing, and one solid barrier presented itself to the Allies. It is
probable that the German preponderance of numbers was, for the moment, much
lessened or even had ceased to exist, for the losses in battle, the detachments
for Russia, and the operations in Belgium had all combined to deplete the
German ranks.</p>
<p>The Belgian Army had retired into Antwerp before the fall of Brussels, but
they were by no means a force to be disregarded, being fired by that sense of
intolerable wrong which is the most formidable stimulant to a virile nation.
From the shelter of the Antwerp entrenchments they continually buzzed out
against the German lines of communication, and although they were usually
beaten back, and were finally pent in, they still added to the great debt of
gratitude which the Allies already owed them by holding up a considerable body,
two army corps at least, of good troops. On the other hand, the fortress of
Maubeuge, on the northern French frontier, which had been invested within a few
days of the battle of Mons, had now fallen before the heavy German guns, with
the result that at least a corps of troops under Von Zwehl and these same
masterful guns were now released for service on the Aisne.</p>
<p>The more one considers the operation of the crossing of the Aisne with the
battle which followed it, the more one is impressed by the extraordinary
difficulty of the task, the swift debonair way in which it was tackled, and the
pushful audacity of the various commanders in gaining a foothold upon the
farther side. Consider that upon the 12th the Army was faced by a deep, broad,
unfordable river with only one practicable bridge in the fifteen miles opposite
them. They had a formidable enemy armed with powerful artillery standing on the
defensive upon a line of uplands commanding every crossing and approach, whilst
the valley was so broad that ordinary guns upon the corresponding uplands could
have no effect, and good positions lower down were hard to find. There was the
problem. And yet upon the 14th the bulk of the Army was across and had
established itself in positions from which it could never afterwards be driven.
All arms must have worked well to bring about such a result, but what can be
said of the Royal Engineers, who built under heavy fire in that brief space
nine bridges, some of them capable of taking heavy traffic, while they restored
five of the bridges which the enemy had destroyed! September 13, 1914, should
be recorded in their annals as a marvellous example of personal self-sacrifice
and technical proficiency.</p>
<p>Sir John French, acting with great swiftness and decision, did not lose an
hour after he had established himself in force upon the northern bank of the
river in pushing his men ahead and finding out what was in front of him. The
weather was still very wet, and heavy mists drew a veil over the German
dispositions, but the advance went forward. The British right wing, consisting
of the First Division of the Aisne. First Corps, had established itself most
securely, as was natural, since it was the one corps which had formed an
unbroken bridge in front of it. The First Division had pushed forward as far as
Moulins and Vendresse, which lie about two miles north of the river. Now, in
the early hours of the 14th, the whole of the Second Division got over. The
immediate narrative, therefore, is concerned with the doings of the two
divisions of the First Corps, upon which fell the first and chief strain of the
very important and dangerous advance upon that date.</p>

<p class="caption">British Advance at the Aisne</p>
<br>
<p>On the top of the line of chalk hills which faced the British was an ancient
and famous highway, the Chemin-des-Dames, which, like all ancient highways, had
been carried along the crest of the ridge. This was in the German possession,
and it became the objective of the British attack. The 2nd Infantry Brigade
(Bulfin's) led the way, working upwards in the early morning from Moulins and
Vendresse through the hamlet of Troyon towards the great road. This brigade,
consisting of the 2nd Sussex, 1st Northamptons, 1st North Lancashire, and 2nd
Rifles, drawn mostly from solid shire regiments, was second to none in the
Army. Just north of Troyon was a considerable deserted sugar factory, which
formed a feature in the landscape. It lay within a few hundred yards of the
Chemin-des-Dames, while another winding road, cut in the side of the hill, lay
an equal distance to the south of it, and was crossed by the British in their
advance. This road, which was somewhat sunken in the chalk, and thus offered
some cover to a crouching man, played an important part in the operations.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Balfour and a picket of the 2nd Rifles, having crept up and
reconnoitred the factory, returned with the information that it was held by the
Germans, and that twelve guns were in position three hundred yards to the east
of it. General Bulfin then&mdash;it was about 3:30 in the morning of a wet,
misty day&mdash;sent the 2nd Rifles, the 2nd Sussex Regiment, and the 1st
NorthamptonS forward, with the factory and an adjoining whitewashed farmhouse
as their objective. The 1st North Lancashires remained in reserve at Vendresse.
The attacking force was under the immediate command of Colonel Serocold of the
Rifles. The three advanced regiments drove in the pickets of the Germans, and
after a severe fight turned the enemy out of his front trench, A Company of the
Sussex capturing several hundred prisoners. A number of men, however, including
Colonel Montresor and Major Cookson, were shot while rounding up these Germans
and sending them to the rear. The advanced line had suffered severely, so the
North Lancashires were called up and launched at the sugar factory, which they
carried with a magnificent bayonet attack in spite of a fierce German
resistance. Their losses were very heavy, including Major Lloyd, their
commander, but their victory was a glorious one. The two batteries of the enemy
were now commanded by machine-guns, brought up to the factory by Lieutenant
Dashwood of the Sussex. The enemy made a brave attempt to get these guns away,
but the teams and men were shot down, and it was a German Colenso. The British,
however, unlike the Boers, were unable to get away the prizes of their victory.
The factory was abandoned as it was exposed to heavy fire, and the four
regiments formed a firing-line, taking such cover as they could find, but a
German shell fire developed which was so deadly that they were unable to get
forward.</p>
<p>A small party of Rifles, under Cathcart and Foljambe, clung hard to the
captured guns, sending repeated messages: "For God's sake bring horses and
fetch away these pieces!" No horses were, however, available, and eventually
both the guns and the buildings were regained by the Germans, the former being
disabled before they were abandoned by their captors, and the factory being
smashed by the shells. Major Green and a company of the Sussex, with some of
the Coldstream under Major Grant, had got as far forward as the
Chemin-des-Dames, but fell back steadily when their flank was finally exposed.
Two companies of the 1st Coldstream, under Colonel Ponsonby, had also pushed on
to the road, and now came back. Nothing could exceed the desperate gallantry of
officers and men. Major Jelf, severely wounded, cheered on his riflemen until
evening. Major Warre of the same regiment and Major Phillips rallied the
hard-pressed line again and again. Lieutenant Spread, of the Lancashires,
worked his machine-gun until it was smashed, and then, wounded as he was,
brought up a second gun and continued the fight. Major Burrows rallied the
Lancashires when their leader, Major Lloyd, was hit. Brigade-Major Watson, of
the Queen's, was everywhere in the thick of the firing. No men could have been
better led, nor could any leaders have better men. A large number of wounded,
both British and Germans, lay under the shelter of some haystacks between the
lines, and crawled slowly round them for shelter, as the fire came from one
side or the other&mdash;a fitting subject surely for a Verestschagin!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it is necessary to follow what had been going on at the immediate
left of Bulfin's Brigade. Maxse's 1st Brigade had moved up in the face of a
considerable fire until it came to be nearly as far north as the factory, but
to the west of it. The 1st Coldstream had been sent across to help the
dismounted cavalry to cover Bulfin's right, since the main German strength
seemed to be in that quarter. The 1st Scots Guards was held in reserve, but the
other regiments of the 1st Brigade, the 1st Black Watch and the 1st Camerons, a
battalion which had taken the place of the brave but unfortunate Munsters,
lined up on the left of the factory and found themselves swept by the same
devastating fire which had checked the advance. This fire came from the fringe
of the woods and from a line of trenches lying north-east of the factory on the
edge of the Chemin-des-dames. Up to this time the British had no artillery
support on account of the mist, but now Geddes' 25th Brigade R.F.A., comprising
the 113th, 114th, and 115th Batteries, was brought to its assistance. It could
do little good in such a dim light, and one battery, the 115th, under Major
Johnstone, which pushed up within eight hundred yards of the enemy's position,
was itself nearly destroyed. The 116th R.F.A., under Captain Oliver, also did
great work, working its way up till it was almost in the infantry line, and at
one time in advance of it. The whole infantry line, including a mixture of
units, men of the Rifles, Sussex, and North Lancashires, with a sprinkling of
Guardsmen and Black Watch from the 1st Brigade, came slowly down the hill
&mdash; "sweating blood to hold their own," as one of them described
it&mdash;until they reached the sunken road which has been already mentioned.
There General Bulfin had stationed himself with the reserve, and the line
steadied itself, re-formed, and, with the support of the guns, made head once
more against the advancing Germans, who were unable to make any progress
against the fire which was poured into them. With such spades and picks as
could be got, a line of shallow trenches was thrown up, and these were held
against all attacks for the rest of the day.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[ *Until an accurate German military history of the war
shall appear, it is difficult to compute the exact rival forces in any
engagement, but in this attack of the 2nd Brigade, where six British regiments
may be said to have been involved, there are some data. A German officer,
describing the same engagement, says that, apart from the original German
force, the reinforcements amounted to fourteen battalions, from the Guards'
Jaeger, the 4th Jaeger Battalion, 65th, 13th Reserve, and 13th and 16th
Landwehr Regiments. ]</p>
<p>It was the haphazard line of these hurriedly dug shelters which determined
the position retained in the weeks to come. As this was the apex of the British
advance and all the corps upon the left were in turn brought to a standstill
and driven to make trenches, the whole line of the First Corps formed a long
diagonal slash across the hillside, with its right close to the
Chemin-des-dames and its left upon the river in the neighbourhood of Chavonne.
The result was that now and always the trenches of the 2nd Brigade were in an
extremely exposed position, for they were open not only to the direct fire of
the Germans, which was not very severe, but to an enfilading fire from more
distant guns upon each flank. Their immediate neighbours upon the right were
the 1st Queen's Surrey, acting as flank-guard, and a Moroccan corps from the
Fifth French chapter Army, which had not reached so advanced a position, but
was in echelon upon their right rear.</p>
<p>It has already been shown how the 1st Brigade was divided up, the 1st
Coldstream being on the right of the 2nd Brigade. The rest of the 1st Brigade
had carried out an advance parallel to that described, and many of the Black
Watch, who were the right-hand regiment, got mixed with Bulfin's men when they
were driven back to what proved to be the permanent British line. This advance
of the 1st Brigade intercepted a strong force of the enemy which was creeping
round the left flank of the 2nd Brigade. The counter-stroke brought the flank
attack to a standstill. The leading regiments of the 1st Brigade suffered very
severely, however, especially the Cameron Highlanders, whose gallantry carried
them far to the front. This regiment lost Lieutenant-Colonel MacLachlan, 2
majors, Maitland and Nicholson, 3 captains, 11 lieutenants, and about 300 rank
and file in the action. Some of these fell into the hands of the enemy, but the
great majority were killed or wounded. The 1st Scots Guards upon the left of
the brigade had also heavy casualties, while the Black Watch lost their
Colonel, Grant Duff, their Adjutant, Rowan Hamilton, and many men. When the
line on their right fell back, they conformed to the movement until they
received support from two companies of the 1st Gloucesters from the 3rd Brigade
upon their left rear.</p>
<p>The 4th (Guards) Brigade, forming the left of the Second Division, was
across the river in battle array by ten o'clock in the morning and moving
northwards towards the village of Ostel. Its task was a Supremely difficult
one. Dense woods faced it, fringed with the hostile riflemen, while a heavy
shell-fire tore through the extended ranks. It Aisne. is safe to say that such
an advance could not have been carried out in the heavy-handed German fashion
without annihilating losses. As it was, the casualties were heavy, but not
sufficient to prevent a continuance of the attack, which at one o'clock carried
the farm and trenches which were its objective. The steep slopes and the thick
woods made artillery support impossible, though one section of a battery did
contrive to keep up with the infantry. The 3rd Coldstream being held up in
their advance on the Soupir front, the 1st Irish were moved up on their right
flank, but the line could do little more than hold its own. Captain Berners,
Lord Guernsey, Lord Arthur Hay, and others were killed at this point. The
German infantry advanced several times to counter-attack, but were swept back
by the fire of the Guards.</p>
<p>At one period it was found that the general German advance, which had
followed the holding of the British attack, was threatening to flow in between
the two divisions of the First Army Corps. The 3rd Brigade (Landon's) was
therefore deployed rapidly from the point about a mile south of Vernesse where
it had been stationed. Two regiments of the brigade, the 2nd Welsh and the 1st
South Wales Borderers, were flung against the heavy German column advancing
down the Beaulne ridge and threatening to cut Haig's corps in two. The
Welshmen, worthy successors of their ancestors who left such a name on the
battlefields of France, succeeded in heading it off and driving it back so that
they were able to extend and get in touch with the right of the Second
Division. This consisted of the 5th Brigade (Haking's) with the 6th (Davies')
upon its left. Both of these brigades had to bear the brunt of continual German
counter-attacks, involving considerable losses, both from shell and rifle fire.
In spite of this they won their way for a mile or more up the slopes, where
they were brought to a standstill and dug themselves into temporary shelter,
continuing the irregular diagonal line of trenches which had been started by
the brigades upon the right.</p>
<p>It is impossible not to admire the way in which the German general in
command observed and attempted to profit by any gap in the British line. It has
already been shown how he tried to push his column between the two divisions of
the First Corps and was only stopped by the deployment of the 3rd Brigade.
Later, an even fairer chance presented itself, and he was quick to take
advantage of it. The advance of the Guards Brigade to the Ostel ridge had
caused a considerable gap between them and the nearest unit of the Second
Corps, and also between the First Corps and the river. A German attack came
swarming down upon the weak spot. From Troyon to Ostel, over five miles of
ground, Haig's corps was engaged to the last man and pinned down in their
positions. It was not possible to fill the gap. Not to fill it might have meant
disaster&mdash;disaster under heavy shell-fire with an unfordable river in the
rear. Here was a supreme example of the grand work that was done when our
cavalry were made efficient as dismounted riflemen. Their mobility brought them
quickly to the danger spot. Their training turned them in an instant from
horsemen to infantry. The 15th Hussars, the Irish Horse, the whole of Briggs'
1st Cavalry Brigade, and finally the whole of De Lisle's 2nd Cavalry Brigade,
were thrown into the gap. The German advance was stayed and the danger passed.
From now onwards the echelon formed by the units of the First Corps ended with
these cavalry brigades near Chavonne to the immediate north of the river.</p>
<p>The Third Division of the Second Corps, being on the immediate left of the
operations which have been already described, moved forward upon Aizy, which is
on about the same level as Ostel, the objective of the Guards. The 8th
(Doran's) Brigade moved north by a tributary stream which runs down to the
Aisne, while the 9th (Shaw's) tried to advance in line with it on the plateau
to the right. Both brigades found it impossible to get any farther, and
established themselves in entrenchments about a mile north of Vailly, so as to
cover the important bridge at that place, where the 7th Brigade was in reserve.
The three Fusilier regiments of the 9th Brigade all lost heavily, and the
Lincolns had at one time to recross the river, but recovered their
position.</p>
<p>The attack made by the Fifth Division near Missy was held up by a very
strong German position among the woods on the Chivres heights which was fronted
by wire entanglements. The regiments chiefly engaged were the Norfolks and
Bedfords of the 15th Brigade, with the Cornwalls and East Surreys of the 14th
Brigade, the remains of the Cheshires being in close support. They crossed the
wire and made good progress at first, but were eventually brought to a stand by
heavy fire at close range from a trench upon their right front. It was already
dusk, so the troops ended by maintaining the position at Missy and Ste.
Marguerite, where there were bridges to be guarded.</p>
<p>The Fourth Division of Pulteney's Third Corps had no better success, and was
only able to maintain its ground. It may be remarked, as an example of valiant
individual effort, that this division was largely indebted for its ammunition
supply to the efforts of Captain Johnston of the Sappers, who, upon a crazy
raft of his own construction, aided by Lieutenant Flint, spent twelve hours
under fire ferrying over the precious boxes. The familiar tale of stalemate was
to be told of the Sixth French Army in the Soissons section of the river. Along
the whole Allied line the position was the same, the greatest success and
probably the hardest fighting having fallen to the lot of the Eighteenth French
Corps, which had taken, lost, and finally retaken Craonne, thus establishing
itself upon the lip of that formidable plateau which had been the objective of
all the attacks.</p>
<p>In the Vailly region the 5th Cavalry Brigade found itself in a difficult
position, for it had crossed the stream as a mounted unit in expectation of a
pursuit, and now found itself under heavy fire in the village of Vailly with no
possibility of getting forward. The only alternative was to recross the river
by the single narrow bridge, which was done at a later date under very heavy
fire, the troopers leading their horses over in single file. This difficult
operation was superintended by Captain Wright of the Engineers, the same brave
officer who had endeavoured to blow up the bridge at Mons. Unhappily, he was
mortally wounded on this occasion. On the afternoon of the 14th&mdash;it being
found that the British artillery was shelling our own advanced
trenches&mdash;Staff-Captain Harter of the 9th Brigade galloped across the
bridge and informed the gunners as to the true position.</p>
<p>Towards evening, in spite of the fact that there were no reserves and that
all the troops had endured heavy losses and great fatigue, a general advance
was ordered in the hope of gaining the high ground of the Chemin-des-Dames
before night. It was nearly sunset when the orders were given, and the troops
responded gallantly to the call, though many of them had been in action since
daybreak. The fire, however, was very heavy, and no great progress could be
made. The First Division gained some ground, but was brought to a standstill.
The only brigade which made good headway was Haking's 5th, which reached the
crest of the hill in the neighbourhood of Tilleul-de-Courtecon. General Haking
sent out scouts, and finding German outposts upon both his flanks, he withdrew
under cover of darkness.</p>
<p>Thus ended the sharp and indecisive action of September 14, the Germans
holding their ground, but being in turn unable to drive back the Allies, who
maintained their position and opposed an impassable obstacle to the renewed
advance upon Paris. The battle was marked by the common features of advance,
arrest, and entrenchment, which occurred not only in the British front, but in
that of the French armies upon either flank. When the action ceased, the 1st
Northamptons and the 1st Queen's, sent to guard the pressure point at the
extreme right of the line, had actually reached the Chemin-des-Dames, the
British objective, and had dug themselves in upon the edge of it. From this
very advanced spot the British line extended diagonally across the hillside for
many miles until it reached the river. Several hundred prisoners and some guns
were taken in the course of the fighting. When one considers the predominant
position of the Germans, and that their artillery was able to give them
constant assistance, whereas that of the British and French was only brought up
with the utmost difficulty, we can only marvel that the infantry were able to
win and to hold the ground.</p>
<p>The next day, September 15, was spent for the most part in making good the
position gained and deepening the trenches to get some protection from the
ever-growing artillery fire, which was the more intense as the great siege guns
from Maubeuge were upon this day, for the first time, brought into action. At
first the terrific explosions of these shells, the largest by far which had
ever been brought into an actual line of battle, were exceedingly alarming, but
after a time it became realised that, however omnipotent they might be against
iron or concrete, they were comparatively harmless in soft soil, where their
enormous excavations were soon used as convenient ready-made rifle-pits by the
soldiers. This heavy fire led to a deepening of the trenches, which
necessitated a general levy of picks and shovels from the country round, for a
large portion of such equipment had been lost in the first week of the
campaign.</p>
<p>Only two active movements were made in the course of the day, one being that
Hamilton's Third Division advanced once more towards Aizy and established
itself a mile or more to the north in a better tactical position. The 7th
Brigade suffered considerable casualties in this change, including Colonel
Hasted, of the 1st Wilts. The other was that Ferguson's Fifth Division fell
back from Chivres, where it was exposed to a cross fire, and made its lines
along the river bank, whence the Germans were never able to drive it, although
they were only four Aisne. hundred yards away in a position which was high
above it. For the rest, it was a day of navvy's toil, though the men worked
alternately with rifle and with pick, for there were continual German advances
which withered away before the volleys which greeted them. By the 16th the
position was fairly secure, and on the same day a welcome reinforcement arrived
in the shape of the Sixth Division, forming the missing half of Pulteney's
Third Corps.</p>

<p>This division was kept in reserve upon the south side of the river. The
French Commander-in-Chief had intimated that he intended to throw in
reinforcements upon the left of the Sixth French Army, and so, as he hoped, to
turn the German right. It was determined, therefore, that there should be no
attempt at a British advance, but that the Allies should be content with
holding the enemy to his positions. The two armies lay facing each other,
therefore, at an average distance of about five hundred yards. The pressure was
still most severe upon the 2nd Brigade on the extreme right. Bulfin's orders
were to hold on at all costs, as he was the pivot of the whole line. He and his
men responded nobly to the responsibility, although both they and their
neighbours of Maxse's 1st Brigade had sustained a loss of over 1000 men each
upon the 14th&mdash;25 per cent of their number. The shell-fire was incessant
and from several converging directions. German infantry attacks were constant
by night and by day, and the undrained trenches were deep in water. The men lay
without overcoats and drenched to the skin, for the rain was incessant. Yet the
sixth day found them on the exact ground upon which they had thrown their weary
bodies after their attack. Nations desire from time to time to be reassured as
to their own virility. Neither in endurance nor in courage have the British
departed from the traditions of their ancestors. The unending strain of the
trenches reached the limits of human resistance. But the line was always
held.</p>
<p>On September 16 occurred an incident which may be taken as typical of the
difference in the spirit with which the British and the Germans make war. Close
to the lines of the Guards a barn which contained fifty wounded Germans was
ignited by the enemy's shells. Under a terrific fire a rescue party rushed
forward and got the unfortunate men to a place of safety.</p>
<p>Several of the British lost their lives in this exploit, including Dr.
Huggan, the Scottish International footballer. The Germans mock at our respect
for sport, and yet this is the type of man that sport breeds, and it is the
want of them in their own ranks which will stand for ever between us.</p>
<p>September 17 was a day of incessant attacks upon the right of the line,
continually repulsed and yet continually renewed. One can well sympathise with
the feelings of the German commanders who, looking down from their heights, saw
the British line in a most dangerous strategical position, overmatched by their
artillery, with a deep river in their rear, and yet were unable to take
advantage of it because of their failure to carry the one shallow line of
extemporised trenches. Naturally, they came again and again, by night and by
day, with admirable perseverance and daring to the attack, but were always
forced to admit that nothing can be done against the magazine rifle in hands
which know how to use it. They tried here and they tried there, these constant
sudden outpourings of cheering, hurrying, grey-clad men. They were natural
tactics, but expensive ones, for every new attack left a fresh fringe of
stricken men in front of the British lines.</p>
<p>One incident upon the 17th stands out amid the somewhat monotonous record of
trench attacks. On the extreme right of the British line a company of the 1st
Northamptons occupied a most exposed position on the edge of the
Chemin-des-Dames. The men in a German trench which was some hundreds of yards
in front hoisted a white flag and then advanced upon the British lines. It is
well to be charitable in all these white flag incidents, since it is always
possible on either side that unauthorised men may hoist it and the officer in
command very properly refuse to recognise it; but in this case the deception
appears to have been a deliberate one. These are the facts. On seeing the flag,
Captain Savage, of B Company Northamptons, got out of the trench and with
Lieutenant Dimmer, of the Rifles, advanced to the Germans. He threw down his
sword and revolver to show that he was unarmed. He found a difficulty in
getting a direct answer from the Germans, so he saluted their officer, who
returned his salute, and turned back to walk to his own trench. Dimmer, looking
back, saw the Germans level their rifles, so he threw himself down, crying out,
"For God's sake get down." Captain Savage stood erect and was riddled with
bullets. Many of the Northamptons, including Lieutenant Gordon, were shot down
by the same volley. The Germans then attempted an advance, which was stopped by
the machine-guns of the 1st Queen's. Such deplorable actions must always
destroy all the amenities of civilised warfare. On the afternoon of the same
day, September 17, a more serious attack was made upon the right flank of the
advanced British position, the enemy reoccupying a line of trenches from which
they had previously been driven. It was a dismal day of wind, rain, and mist,
but the latter was not wholly an evil, as it enabled that hard-worked regiment,
the 1st Northamptons, under their Colonel, Osborne Smith, to move swiftly
forward and, with the help of the 1st Queen's, carry the place at the bayonet
point. Half the Germans in the trench were put out of action, thirty-eight
taken, and the rest fled. Pushing on after their success, they found the ridge
beyond held by a considerable force of German infantry. The 2nd Rifles had come
into the fight, and a dismounted squadron of the composite cavalry regiment put
in some good work upon the flank. The action was continued briskly until dark,
when both sides retained their ground with the exception of the captured line
of trenches, which remained with the British. Seven officers and about 200 men
were killed or wounded in this little affair.</p>
<p>The 18th found the enemy still acting upon the Napoleonic advice of
<i>T&acirc;tez toujours</i>. All day they were feeling for that weak place
which could never be found. The constant attempts were carried on into the
night with the same monotonous record of advance leading to repulse. At one
time it was the line of the 1st Queen's&mdash;and no line in the Army would be
less likely to give results. Then it was the left flank of the First Division,
and then the front of the Second. Now and again there were swift counters from
the British, in one of which an enemy's trench was taken by the 1st Gloucesters
with the two machine-guns therein. But there was no inducement for any general
British advance. "We have nothing to lose by staying here," said a General,
"whereas every day is of importance to the Germans, so the longer we can detain
them here the better." So it seemed from the point of view of the Allies. There
is a German point of view also, however, which is worthy of consideration. They
were aware, and others were not, that great reserves of men were left in the
Fatherland, even as there were in France and in Britain, but that, unlike
France and Britain, they actually had the arms and equipment for them, so that
a second host could rapidly be called into the field. If these legions were in
Belgium, they could ensure the fall of Antwerp, overrun the country, and seize
the seaboard. All this could be effected while the Allies were held at the
Aisne. Later, with these vast reinforcements, the Aisne. German armies might
burst the barrier which held them and make a second descent upon Paris, which
was still only fifty miles away. So the Germans may have argued, and the
history of the future was to show that there were some grounds for such a
calculation. It was in truth a second war in which once again the Germans had
the men and material ready, while the Allies had not.</p>
<p>This date, September 18, may be taken as the conclusion of the actual Battle
of the Aisne, since from that time the operations defined themselves definitely
as a mutual siege and gigantic artillery duel. The casualties of the British at
the Aisne amounted, up to that date, to 10,000 officers and men, the great
majority of which were suffered by Haig's First Army Corps. The action had
lasted from the 13th, and its outstanding features, so far as our forces were
concerned, may be said to have been the remarkable feat of crossing the river
and the fine leadership of General Haig in the dangerous position in which he
found himself. It has been suggested that the single unbroken bridge by which
he crossed may have been a trap purposely laid by the Germans, whose plans
miscarried owing to the simultaneous forcing of the river at many other points.
As it was, the position of the First Corps was a very difficult one, and a
reverse might have become an absolute disaster. It was impossible for General
French to avoid this risk, for since the weather precluded all air
reconnaissance, it was only by pushing his Army across that he could be sure of
the enemy's dispositions. The net result was one more demonstration upon both
sides that the defensive force has so great an advantage under modern
conditions that if there be moderate equality of numbers, and if the flanks of
each be guarded, a condition of stalemate will invariably ensue, until the
campaign is decided by economic causes or by military movements in some other
part of the field of operations.</p>
<p>There is ample evidence that for the time the German Army, though able with
no great effort to hold the extraordinarily strong position which had been
prepared for it, was actually in very bad condition. Large new drafts had been
brought out, which had not yet been assimilated by the army. The resistance of
Maubeuge had blocked one of their supply railroads, and for some time the
commissariat had partially broken down. Above all, they were mentally depressed
by meeting such resistance where they had been led to expect an easy victory,
by their forced retreat when almost within sight of Paris, and by their losses,
which had been enormous. In spite of their own great superiority in heavy guns,
the French light field-pieces had controlled the battlefields. There is ample
evidence in the letters which have been intercepted, apart from the statements
and appearance of the prisoners, to show the want and depression which
prevailed. This period, however, may be said to mark the nadir of the German
fortunes in this year. The fall of Maubeuge improved their supplies of every
sort, their reserves and Landwehr got broken in by the war of the trenches, and
the eventual fall of Antwerp and invasion of Western Belgium gave them that
moral stimulus which they badly needed.</p>
<p>Some wit amongst the officers has described the war as "months of boredom
broken by moments of agony." It is the duty of the chronicler to record, even
if he attempts to alleviate, the former, for the most monotonous procession of
events form integral parts of the great whole. The perusal of a great number of
diaries and experiences leaves a vague and disconnected recollection behind it
of personal escapes, of the terror of high explosives, of the excellence of the
rear services of the Army, of futile shellings &mdash;with an occasional tragic
mishap, where some group of men far from the front were suddenly, by some freak
of fate, blown to destruction, &mdash; of the discomforts of wet trenches, and
the joys of an occasional relief in the villages at the rear. Here and there,
however, in the monotony of what had now become a mutual siege, there stand out
some episodes or developments of a more vital character, which will be recorded
in their sequence.</p>
<p>It may be conjectured that, up to the period of the definite entrenchment of
the two armies, the losses of the enemy were not greater than our own. It is in
the attack that losses are incurred, and the attack had, for the most part,
been with us. The heavier guns of the Germans had also been a factor in their
favour. From the 18th onwards, however, the weekly losses of the enemy must
have been very much greater than ours, since continually, night and day, they
made onslaughts, which attained some partial and temporary success upon the
20th, but which on every other occasion were blown back by the rifle-fire with
which they were met. So mechanical and halfhearted did they at last become that
they gave the impression that those who made them had no hope of success, and
that they were only done at the bidding of some imperious or imperial voice
from the distance. In these attacks, though any one of them may have only
furnished a few hundred casualties, the total spread over several weeks must
have equalled that of a very great battle, and amounted, since no progress was
ever made, to a considerable defeat.</p>
<p>Thus on September 19 there was a succession of attacks, made with
considerable vivacity and proportional loss. About 4 P.M. one developed in
front of the 4th and 6th Brigades of the First Corps, but was speedily stopped.
An hour later another one burst forth upon the 7th and 9th Brigades of the
Second Corps, with the same result. The artillery fire was very severe all day
and the broad valley was arched from dawn to dusk by the flying shell. The
weather was still detestable, and a good many were reported ill from the
effects of constant wet and cold. The 20th was the date of two separate
attacks, one of which involved some hard fighting and considerable loss. The
first, at eight in the morning, was upon Shaw's 9th Brigade and was driven off
without great difficulty. The second was the more serious and demands some
fuller detail.</p>
<p>On the arrival of the Sixth Division upon the 18th, Sir John French had
determined to hold them in reserve and to use them to relieve, in turn, each of
the brigades which had been so hard-worked during the previous week. Of these,
there was none which needed and deserved a rest more than Bulfin's 2nd Brigade,
which, after their attack upon the Chemin-des-Dames upon the 14th, had made and
held the trenches which formed both the extreme right and the advanced point of
the British line. For nearly a week these men of iron had lain where the battle
had left them. With the object of relieving them, the 18th Brigade (Congreve's)
of the Sixth Division was ordered to take their places. The transfer was
successfully effected at night, but the newcomers, who had only arrived two
days before from England, found themselves engaged at once in a very serious
action. It may have been coincidence, or it may have been that with their
remarkable system of espionage the Germans learned that new troops had taken
the place of those whose mettle they had tested so often; but however this may
be, they made a vigorous advance upon the afternoon of September 20, coming on
so rapidly and in such numbers that they drove out the occupants both of the
front British trenches&mdash;which were manned by three companies of the 1st
West Yorkshires&mdash;and the adjoining French trench upon the right, which was
held by the Turcos. The West Yorkshires were overwhelmed and enfiladed with
machine-guns, a number were shot down, and others were taken prisoners.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the rest of the brigade were in immediate support, and orders
were given by General Congreve to advance and to regain the ground that had
been lost. The rush up the hill was carried out by the 2nd Notts and Derby
Regiment (Sherwood Foresters) in the centre, with the remainder of the West
Yorks upon their right, and the 2nd Durham Light Infantry upon their left. They
were supported by the 1st East Yorks and by the 2nd Sussex, who had just been
called out of the line for a rest. The 4th Irish Dragoon Guards at a gallop at
at first, and then dismounting with rifle and bayonet, were in the forefront of
the fray. The advance was over half a mile of ground, most of which was clear
of any sort of cover, but it was magnificently carried out and irresistible in
its impetus. All the regiments lost heavily, but all reached their goal.
Officers were hit again and again, but staggered on with their men. Captain
Popham, of the Sherwood Foresters, is said to have carried six wounds with him
up the slope. Fifteen officers and 250 men were shot down, but the lost trench
was carried at the point of the bayonet and the whole position re-established.
The total casualties were 1364, more than half of which fell upon the West
Yorkshires, while the majority of the others were Sherwood Foresters, East
Yorkshires, and Durhams. Major Robb, of the latter regiment, was among those
who fell. The Germans did not hold the trenches for an hour, and yet the
engagement may be counted as a success for them, since our losses were
certainly heavier than theirs. There was no gain, however, in ground. The
action was more than a mere local attack, and the British line was in danger of
being broken had it not been for the determined counterattack of the 18th
Brigade and of the Irish dragoons. To the north of this main attack there was
another subsidiary movement on the Beaulne ridge, in which the 5th and 6th
Brigades were sharply engaged. The 1st King's, the 2nd H.L.I., and the 2nd
Worcesters all sustained some losses.</p>
<p>About this period both the British and the French armies began to strengthen
themselves with those heavy guns in which they had been so completely
overweighted by their enemy. On the 20th the French in the neighbourhood of our
lines received twelve long-range cannon, firing a 35 lb. shell a distance of
twelve kilometres. Three days later the opened fire with four new batteries of
six-inch howitzers. From this time onwards there was no such great disparity in
the heavy artillery, and the wounded from the monster shells of the enemy had
at least the slight solace that their fate was not unavenged. The expenditure
of shells, however, was still at the rate of ten German to one of the Allies.
If the war was not won it was no fault of Krupp and the men of Essen. In two
weeks the British lost nearly 3000 men from shell-fire.</p>
<p>It was at this time, September 20, that the Germans Rheims put a climax upon
the long series of outrages and vandalisms of which their troops had been
guilty by the bombardment of Rheims Cathedral, the Westminster Abbey of France.
The act seems to have sprung from deliberate malice, for though it was asserted
afterwards that the tower had been used as an artillery observation point, this
is in the highest degree improbable, since the summit of the ridge upon the
French side is available for such a purpose. The cathedral was occupied at the
time by a number of German wounded, who were the sufferers by the barbarity of
their fellow-countrymen. The incident will always remain as a permanent record
of the value of that <i>Kultur</i> over which we have heard such frantic
boasts. The records of the French, Belgian, and British Commissions upon the
German atrocities, reinforced by the recollection of the burned University of
Louvain and the shattered Cathedral of Rheims, will leave a stain upon the
German armies which can never be erased. Their conduct is the more remarkable,
since the invasion of 1870 was conducted with a stem but rigid discipline,
which won the acknowledgment of the world. In spite of all the material
progress and the superficial show of refinement, little more than a generation
seems to have separated civilisation from primitive barbarity, which attained
such a pitch that no arrangement could be made by which the wounded between the
lines could be brought in. Such was the code of a nominally Christian nation in
the year 1914.</p>
<p>Up to now the heavier end of the fighting had been borne by Haig's First
Corps, but from the 20th onwards the Second and Third sustained the impact. The
action just described, in which the West Yorkshires suffered so severely, was
fought mainly by the 18th Brigade of Pulteney's Third Corps. On the 21st it was
the turn of the Second Corps. During the night the 1st Wiltshire battalion of
McCracken's 7th Brigade was attacked, and making a strong counter-attack in the
morning they cleared a wood with the bayonet, and advanced the British line at
that point. A subsequent attack upon the same brigade was repulsed. How heavy
the losses had been in the wear and tear of six days' continual trench work is
shown by the fact that when on this date the 9th Brigade (Shaw's) was taken
back for a rest it had lost 30 officers and 860 men since crossing the
Aisne.</p>
<p>The German heavy guns upon the 21st set fire to the village of Missy, but
failed to dislodge the 1st East Surreys who held it. This battalion, in common
with the rest of Ferguson's Division, were dominated night and day by a
plunging fire from above. It is worth recording that in spite of the strain,
the hardship, and the wet trenches, the percentage of serious sickness among
the troops was lower than the normal rate of a garrison town. A few cases of
enteric appeared about this time, of which six were in one company of the
Coldstream Guards. It is instructive to note that in each case the man belonged
to the uninoculated minority.</p>
<p>A plague of spies infested the British and French lines at this period, and
their elaborate telephone installations, leading from haystacks or from
cellars, showed the foresight of the enemy. Some of these were German officers,
who bravely took their Lives in their hands from the patriotic motive of
helping their country. Others, alas, were residents who had sold their souls
for German gold. One such&mdash;a farmer&mdash;was found with a telephone
within his house and no less a sum than a thousand pounds in specie. Many a
battery concealed in a hollow, and many a convoy in a hidden road, were amazed
by the accuracy of a fire which was really directed, not from the distant guns,
but from some wayside hiding place. Fifteen of these men were shot and the
trouble abated.</p>
<p>The attacks upon the British trenches, which had died down for several days,
were renewed with considerable vigour upon September 26. The first, directed
against the 1st Queen's, was carried out by a force of about 1000 men, who
advanced in close order, and, coming under machine-gun fire, were rapidly
broken up. The second was made by a German battalion debouching from the woods
in front of the 1st South Wales Borderers. This attack penetrated the line at
one point, the left company of the regiment suffering severely, with all its
officers down. The reserve company, with the help of the 2nd Welsh Regiment,
retook the trenches after a hot fight, which ended by the wood being cleared.
The Germans lost heavily in this struggle, 80 of them being picked up on the
very edge of the trench. The Borderers also had numerous casualties, which
totalled up to 7 officers and 182 men, half of whom were actually killed.</p>
<p>The Army was now in a very strong position, for the trenches were so well
constructed that unless a shell by some miracle went right in, no harm would
result. The weather had become fine once more, and the flying service relieved
the anxieties of the commanders as to a massed attack. The heavy artillery of
the Allies was also improving from day to day, especially the heavy British
howitzers, aided by aeroplane observers with a wireless installation. On the
other hand, the guns were frequently hit by the enemy's fire. The 22nd R.F.A.
lost a gun, the 50th three guns, and other batteries had similar losses.
Concealment had not yet been reduced to a science.</p>
<p>At this period the enemy seems to have realised that his attacks, whether
against the British line or against the French armies which flanked it, and had
fought throughout with equal tenacity, were a mere waste of life. The assaults
died away or became mere demonstrations. Early in October the total losses of
the Army upon the Aisne had been 561 officers and 12,980 men, a proportion
which speaks well for the coolness and accuracy of the enemy's sharp-shooters,
while it exhibits our own forgetfulness of the lessons of the African War,
where we learned that the officer should be clad and armed so like the men as
to be indistinguishable even at short ranges. Of this large total the Second
Corps lost 136 officers and 3095 men, and the First Corps 348 officers and 6073
men, the remaining 77 officers and 3812 men being from the Third Corps and the
cavalry.</p>
<p>It was at this period that a great change came over both the object and the
locality of the operations. This change depended upon two events which had
occurred far to the north, and reacted upon the great armies locked in the long
grapple of the Aisne. The first of these controlling circumstances was that, by
the movement of the old troops and the addition of new ones, each army had
sought to turn the flank of the other in the north, until the whole centre of
gravity of the war was transferred to that region. A new French army under
General Castelnau, whose fine defence of Nancy had put him in the front of
French leaders, had appeared on the extreme left wing of the Allies, only to be
countered by fresh bodies of Germans, until the ever-extending line lengthened
out to the manufacturing districts of Lens and Lille, where amid pit-shafts and
slag-heaps the cavalry of the French and the Germans tried desperately to get
round each other's flank. The other factor was the fall of Antwerp, which had
released very large bodies of Germans, who were flooding over Western Belgium,
and, with the help of great new levies from Germany, carrying the war to the
sand-dunes of the coast. The operations which brought about this great change
open up a new chapter in the history of the war. The actual events which
culminated in the fall of Antwerp may be very briefly handled, since, important
as they were, they were not primarily part of the British task, and hence
hardly come within the scope of this narrative.</p>
<p>The Belgians, after the evacuation of Brussels in August, had withdrawn
their army into the widespread fortress of Antwerp, from which they made
frequent sallies upon the Germans who were garrisoning their country. Great
activity was shown and several small successes were gained, which had the
useful effect of detaining two corps which might have been employed upon the
Aisne. Eventually, towards the end of September, the Germans turned their
attention seriously to the reduction of the city, with a well founded
confidence that no modern forts could resist the impact of their enormous
artillery. They drove the garrison within the lines, and early in October
opened a bombardment upon the outer forts with such results that it was
evidently only a matter of days before they would fall and the fine old city be
faced with the alternative of surrender or destruction. The Spanish fury of
Parma's pikemen would be a small thing compared to the <i>furor Teutonicus</i>
working its evil deliberate will upon town-hall or cathedral, with the aid of
fire-disc, petrol-spray, or other products of culture. The main problem before
the Allies, if the town could not be saved, was to ensure that the Belgian army
should be extricated and that nothing of military value which could be
destroyed should be left to the invaders. No troops were available for a
rescue, for the French and British old formations were already engaged, while
the new ones were not yet ready for action. In these circumstances, a
resolution was come to by the British leaders which was bold to the verge of
rashness and so chivalrous as to be almost quixotic. It was determined to send
out at the shortest notice a naval division, one brigade of which consisted of
marines, troops who are second to none in the country's service, while the
other two brigades were young amateur sailor volunteers, most of whom had only
chapter been under arms for a few weeks. It was an extraordinary experiment, as
testing how far the average sport-loving, healthy-minded young Briton needs
only his equipment to turn him into a soldier who, in spite of all rawness and
inefficiency, can still affect the course of a campaign. This strange force,
one-third veterans and two-thirds practically civilians, was hurried across to
do what it could for the failing town, and to demonstrate to Belgium how real
was the sympathy which prompted us to send all that we had. A reinforcement of
a very different quality was dispatched a few days later in the shape of the
Seventh Division of the Regular Army, with the Third Division of Cavalry. These
fine troops were too late, however, to save the city, and soon found themselves
in a position where it needed all their hardihood to save themselves.</p>
<p>The Marine Brigade of the Naval Division under General Paris was dispatched
from England in the early morning and reached Antwerp during the night of
October 3. They were about 2000 in number. Early next morning they were out in
the trenches, relieving some weary Belgians. The Germans were already within
the outer enceinte and drawing close to the inner. For forty-eight hours they
held the line in the face of heavy shelling. The cover was good and the losses
were not heavy. At the end of that time the Belgian troops, who had been a good
deal worn by their heroic exertions, were unable to sustain the German
pressure, and evacuated the trenches on the flank of the British line. The
brigade then fell back to a reserve position in front of the town.</p>
<p>On the night of the 5th the two other brigades of the division, numbering
some 5000 amateur sailors, arrived in Antwerp, and the whole force assembled on
the new line of defence. Mr. Winston Churchill showed his gallantry as a man,
and his indiscretion as a high official, whose life was of great value to his
country by accompanying the force from England. The bombardment was now very
heavy, and the town was on fire in several places. The equipment of the British
left much to be desired, and their trenches were as indifferent as their
training. None the less they played the man and lived up to the traditions of
that great service upon whose threshold they stood. For three days these men,
who a few weeks before had been anything from schoolmasters to tram-conductors,
held their perilous post. They were very raw, but they possessed a great asset
in their officers, who were usually men of long service. But neither the lads
of the naval brigades nor the war-worn and much-enduring Belgians could stop
the mouths of those inexorable guns. On the 8th it was clear that the forts
could no longer be held. The British task had been to maintain the trenches
which connected the forts with each other, but if the forts went it was clear
that the trenches must be outflanked and untenable. The situation, therefore,
was hopeless, and all that remained was to save the garrison and leave as
little as possible for the victors. Some thirty or forty German merchant ships
in the harbour were sunk and the great petrol tanks were set on fire. By the
light of the flames the Belgian and British forces made their way successfully
out of the town, and the good service rendered later by our Allies upon the
Yser and elsewhere is the best justification of the policy which made us strain
every nerve in order to do everything which could have a moral or material
effect upon them in their darkest hour. Had the British been able to get away
unscathed, the whole operation might have been reviewed with equanimity if not
with satisfaction, but, unhappily, a grave misfortune, arising rather from bad
luck than from the opposition of the enemy, came upon the retreating brigades,
so that very many of our young sailors after their one week of crowded life
came to the end of their active service for the war.</p>
<p>On leaving Antwerp it had been necessary to strike to the north in order to
avoid a large detachment of the enemy who were said to be upon the line of the
retreat. The boundary between Holland and Belgium is at this point very
intricate, with no clear line of demarcation, and a long column of British
somnambulists, staggering along in the dark after so many days in which they
had for the most part never enjoyed two consecutive hours of sleep, wandered
over the fatal line and found themselves in firm but kindly Dutch custody for
the rest of the war. Some fell into the hands of the enemy, but the great
majority were interned. These men belonged chiefly to three battalions of the
1st Brigade. The 2nd Brigade, with one battalion of the 1st, and the greater
part of the Marines, made their way to the trains at St. Gilles-Waes, and were
able to reach Ostend in safety. The remaining battalion of Marines, with a
number of stragglers of the other brigades, were cut off at Morbede by the
Germans, and about half of them were taken, while the rest fought their way
through in the darkness and joined their comrades. The total losses of the
British in the whole misadventure from first to last were about 2500 men
&mdash;a high price, and yet not too high when weighed against the results of
their presence at Antwerp. On October 10 the Germans under General Von Beseler
occupied the city. Mr. Powell, who was present, testifies that 60,000 marched
into the town, and that they were all troops of the active army.</p>
<p>It has already been described how the northern ends of the two contending
armies were endeavouring to outflank each other, and there seemed every
possibility that this process would be carried out until each arrived at the
coast. Early in October Sir John French represented to General Joffre that it
would be well that the British Army should be withdrawn from the Aisne and take
its position to the left of the French forces, a move which would shorten its
line of communications very materially, and at the same time give it the task
of defending the Channel coast. General Joffre agreed to the proposition, and
the necessary steps were at once taken to put it into force. The Belgians had
in the meanwhile made their way behind the line of the Yser, where a formidable
position had been prepared. There, with hardly a day of rest, they were ready
to renew the struggle with the ferocious ravagers of their country. The Belgian
Government had been moved to France, and their splendid King, who will live in
history as the most heroic and chivalrous figure of the war, continued by his
brave words and noble example to animate the spirits of his countrymen.</p>
<p>From this time Germany was in temporary occupation of all Belgium, save only
the one little corner, the defence of which will be recorded for ever. Little
did she profit by her crime or by the excuses and forged documents by which she
attempted to justify her action. She entered the land in dishonour and
dishonoured will quit it. William, Germany, and Belgium are an association of
words which will raise in the minds of posterity all that Parma, Spain, and the
Lowlands have meant to us&mdash;an episode of oppression, cruelty, and
rapacity, which fresh generations may atone for but can never efface.</p>

<p class="first">IN accordance with the new plans, the great transference began
upon October 3. It was an exceedingly difficult problem, since an army of more
than 100,000 had to be gradually extricated by night from trenches which were
often not more than a hundred yards from the enemy, while a second army of
equal numbers had to be substituted in its place. The line of retreat was down
an open slope, across exposed bridges, and up the slope upon the southern bank.
Any alarm to the Germans might have been fatal, since a vigorous night attack
in the middle of the operation would have been difficult to resist, and even an
artillery bombardment must have caused great loss of life. The work of the
Staff in this campaign has been worthy of the regimental officers and of the
men. Everything went without a hitch. The Second Cavalry Division (Gough's)
went first, followed immediately by the First (De Lisle's). Then the infantry
was withdrawn, the Second Corps being the vanguard; the Third Corps followed,
and the First was the last to leave. The Second Corps began to clear from its
trenches on October 3-4, and were ready for action on the Aire-Bethune line
upon October 11. The Third Corps was very little behind it, and the First had
reached the new battle-ground upon the 19th. Cavalry went by road; infantry
marched part of the way, trained part of the way, and did the last lap very
often in motor-buses. One way or another the men were got across, the Aisne
trenches were left for ever, and a new phase of the war had begun. From the
chalky uplands and the wooded slopes there was a sudden change to immense
plains of clay, with slow, meandering, ditch-like streams, and all the hideous
features of a great coal-field added to the drab monotony of Nature. No scenes
could be more different, but the same great issue of history and the same old
problem of trench and rifle were finding their slow solution upon each. The
stalemate of the Aisne was for the moment set aside, and once again we had
reverted to the old position where the ardent Germans declared, "This way we
shall come," and the Allies, "Not a mile, save over our bodies."</p>
<p>The narrator is here faced with a considerable difficulty in his attempt to
adhere closely to truth and yet to make his narrative intelligible to the lay
reader. We stand upon the edge of a great battle. If all the operations which
centred at Ypres, but which extend to the Yser Canal upon the north and to La
Bass&eacute;e at the south, be grouped into one episode, it becomes the
greatest clash of arms ever seen up to that hour upon the globe, involving a
casualty list&mdash;Belgian, French, British, and German&mdash;which could by
no means be computed as under 250,000, and probably over 300,000 men. It was
fought over an irregular line, which is roughly forty miles from north to
south, while it lasted, in its active form, from October 12 to November 20
before it settled down to the inevitable siege stage. Thus both in time and in
space it presents difficulties which make a concentrated, connected, and
intelligible narrative no easy task. In order to attempt this, it is necessary
first to give a general idea of what the British Army, in conjunction with its
Allies, was endeavouring to do, and, secondly, to show how the operations
affected each corps in its turn.</p>
<p>During the operations of the Aisne the French had extended the Allied line
far to the north in the hope of outflanking the Germans. The new Tenth French
Army, under General Foch, formed the extreme left of this vast manoeuvre, and
it was supported on its left by the French cavalry. The German right had
lengthened out, however, to meet every fresh extension of the French, and their
cavalry had been sufficiently numerous and alert to prevent the French cavalry
from getting round. Numerous skirmishes had ended in no definite result. It was
at this period that it occurred, as already stated, to Sir John French that to
bring the whole British Army round to the north of the line would both shorten
very materially his communications and would prolong the line to an extent
which might enable him to turn the German flank and make their whole position
impossible. General Joffre having endorsed these views, Sir John took the steps
which we have already seen. The British movement was, therefore, at the outset
an aggressive one. How it became defensive as new factors intruded themselves,
and as a result of the fall of Antwerp, will be shown at a later stage of this
account.</p>
<p>As the Second Corps arrived first upon the scene it will be proper to begin
with some account of its doings from October 12, when it went into action,
until the end of the month, when it found itself brought to a standstill by
superior forces and placed upon the defensive. The doings of the Third Corps
during the same period will be interwoven with those of the Second, since they
were in close co-operation; and, finally, the fortunes of the First Corps will
be followed and the relation shown between its doings and those of the newly
arrived Seventh Division, which had fallen back from the vicinity of Antwerp
and turned at bay near Ypres upon the pursuing Germans. Coming from different
directions, all these various bodies were destined to be formed into one line,
cemented together by their own dismounted cavalry and by French reinforcements,
so as to lay an unbroken breakwater before the great German flood.</p>
<p>The task of the Second Corps was to get into touch with the left flank of
the Tenth French Army in the vicinity of La Bass&eacute;e, and then to wheel
round its own left so as to turn the position of those Germans who were facing
our Allies. The line of the Bethune-Lille road was to be the hinge, connecting
the two armies and marking the turning-point for the British. On the 11th
Gough's Second Cavalry Division was clearing the woods in front of the
Aire-Bethune Canal, which marked the line of the Second Corps. By evening Gough
had connected up the Third Division of the Second Corps with the Sixth Division
of the The Third Corps, which was already at Hazebrouck. On the 12th the Third
Division crossed the canal, operations, followed by the Fifth Division, with
the exception of the 13th Brigade, which remained to the south of it. Both
divisions advanced more or less north before swinging round to almost due east
in their outflanking movement. The rough diagram gives an idea of the point
from which they started and the positions reached at various dates before they
came to an equilibrium. There were many weary stages, however, between the
outset and the fulfilment, and the final results were destined to be barren as
compared with the exertions and the losses involved. None the less it was, as
it proved, an essential part of that great operation by which the
British&mdash;with the help of their good allies &mdash;checked the German
advance upon Calais in October and November, even as they had helped to head
them off from Paris in August and September. During these four months the
little British Army, far from being negligible, as some critics had foretold
would be the case in a Continental war, was absolutely vital in holding the
Allied line and taking the edge off the hacking German sword.</p>

<p class="caption">Operations of Smith-Dorrien's Second Corps and Pulteney's
Third Corps, October 11-19, 1914</p>
<br>
<p>The Third Corps, which had detrained at St. Omer and moved to Hazebrouck,
was intended to move in touch with the Second, prolonging its line to the
north. The First and Second British Cavalry Divisions, now under the command of
De Lisle and of Gough, with Allenby as chief, had a role of their own to play,
and the space between the Second and Third Corps was now filled up by a French
Cavalry Division under Conneau, a whole-hearted soldier always ready to respond
to any call. There was no strong opposition yet in front of the Third Corps,
but General Pulteney moved rapidly forwards, brushed aside all resistance, and
seized the town of Bailleul. A German position in front of the town, held by
cavalry and infantry without guns, was rushed by a rapid advance of Haldane's
10th Infantry Brigade, the 2nd Seaforths particularly distinguishing
themselves, though the 1st Warwicks and 1st Irish Fusiliers had also a good
many losses, the Irishmen clearing the trenches to the cry of
"Faugh-a-Ballagh!" which has sounded so often upon battlefields of old. The
10th Brigade was on the left of the corps, and in touch with the Second Cavalry
Division to the north. The whole action, with its swift advance and moderate
losses, was a fine vindication of British infantry tactics. On the evening of
October 15 the Third Corps had crossed the Lys, and on the 18th they extended
from Warneton in the north to almost within touch of the position of the Second
Corps at Aubers upon the same date.</p>
<p>The country to the south in which the Second Corps was advancing upon
October 12 was an extraordinarily difficult one, which offered many advantages
to the defence over the attack. It was so flat that it was impossible to find
places for artillery observation, and it was intersected with canals, high
hedgerows, and dykes, which formed ready-made trenches. The Germans were at
first not in strength, and consisted for the most part of dismounted cavalry
drawn from four divisions, but from this time onwards there was a constant
fresh accession of infantry and guns. They disputed with great skill and energy
every position which could be defended, and the British advance during the day,
though steady, was necessarily slow. Every hamlet, hedgerow, and stream meant a
separate skirmish. The troops continually closed ranks, advanced, extended, and
attacked from morning to night, sleeping where they had last fought. There was
nothing that could be called a serious engagement, and yet the
losses&mdash;almost entirely from the Third Division&mdash;amounted to 300 for
the day, the heaviest sufferers being the 2nd Royal Scots.</p>
<p>On the next day, the 13th, the corps swung round its left so as to develop
the turning movement already described. Its front of advance was about eight
miles, and it met resistance which made all progress difficult. Again the 8th
Brigade, especially the Royal Scots and 4th Middlesex, lost heavily. So
desperate was the fighting that the Royal Scots had 400 casualties including 9
officers, and the Middlesex fared little better. The principal fighting,
however, fell late in the evening upon the 15th Brigade (Gleichen's), who were
on the right of the line and in touch with the Bethune Canal. The enemy, whose
line of resistance had been considerably thickened by the addition of several
battalions of Jaeger and part of the Fourteenth Corps, made a spirited
counterattack on this portion of the advance. The 1st Bedfords were roughly
handled and driven back, with the result that the 1st Dorsets, who were
stationed at a bridge over the canal near Givenchy, found their flanks exposed
and sustained heavy losses, amounting to 400 men, including Major Roper.
Colonel Bols, of the same regiment, enjoyed one crowded hour of glorious life,
for he was wounded, captured, and escaped all on the same evening. It was in
this action also that Major Vandeleur* was wounded and captured.</p>
<p class="footnote">[ *Major Vandeleur was the officer who afterwards escaped
from Krefeld and brought back with him a shocking account of the German
treatment of our prisoners. Though a wounded man, the Major was kicked by the
direct command of one German officer, and his overcoat was taken from him in
bitter weather by another.]</p>
<p>A section of guns which was involved in the same dilemma as the Dorsets had
to be abandoned after every gunner had fallen. The 15th Brigade was compelled
to fall back for half a mile and entrench itself for the night. On the left the
7th Brigade (McCracken's) had some eighty casualties in crossing the Lys, and a
detachment of Northumberland Fusiliers, who covered their left flank, came
under machine-gun fire, which struck down their adjutant, Captain Herbert, and
a number of men. Altogether the losses on this day amounted to about twelve
hundred men.</p>
<p>On the 14th the Second Corps continued its slow advance in the same
direction. Upon this day the Third Division sustained a grievous loss in the
shape of its commander, General Sir Hubert Hamilton, who was standing
conversing with the quiet nonchalance which was characteristic of him, when a
shell burst above him and a shrapnel bullet struck him on the temple, killing
him at once. He was a grand commander, beloved by his men, and destined for the
highest had he lived. He was buried that night after dark in a village
churchyard. There was an artillery attack by the Germans during the service,
and the group of silent officers, weary from the fighting line, who stood with
bowed heads round the grave, could hardly hear the words of the chaplain for
the whiz and crash of the shells. It was a proper ending for a soldier.</p>
<p>His division was temporarily taken over by General Colin Mackenzie. On this
date the 13th Brigade, on the south of the canal, was relieved by French
troops, so that henceforward all the British were to the north. For the three
preceding days this brigade had done heavy work, the pressure of the enemy
falling particularly upon the 2nd Scottish Borderers, who lost Major Allen and
a number of other officers and men.</p>
<p>The 15th was a day of spirited advance, the Third Division offering
sacrifice in the old warrior fashion to the shade of its dead leader. Guns were
brought up into the infantry line and the enemy was smashed out of entrenched
positions and loopholed villages in spite of a most manful resistance. The
soldiers carried long planks with them and threw them over the dykes on their
advance. Mile after mile the Germans were pushed back, until they were driven
off the high road which connects Estaires with La Bass&eacute;e. The 1st
Northumberland and 4th Royal Fusiliers of the 9th Brigade, and the 2nd Royal
Scots and 4th Middlesex of the 8th, particularly distinguished themselves in
this day of hard fighting. By the night of the 15th the corps had lost 90
officers and 2500 men in the four days, the disproportionate number of officers
being due to the broken nature of the fighting, which necessitated the constant
leading of small detachments. The German resistance continued to be
admirable.</p>
<p>On the 16th the slow wheeling movement of the Second Corps went steadily
though slowly forward, meeting always the same stubborn resistance. The British
were losing heavily by the incessant fighting, but so were the Germans, and it
was becoming question which could stand punishment longest. In the evening the
Third Division was brought to a stand by the village of Aubers, which was found
to be strongly held. The Fifth Division was instructed to mark time upon the
right, so as to form the pivot upon which all the rest of the corps could swing
round in their advance on La Bass&eacute;e. At this date the Third Corps was no
great distance to the north, and the First Corps was detraining from the Aisne.
As the Seventh Division with Byng's Third Cavalry Division were reported to be
in touch with the other forces in the north, the concentration of the British
Army was approaching a successful issue. The weather up to now during all the
operations which have been described was wet and misty, limiting the use of
artillery and entirely preventing that of aircraft.</p>
<p>On the 17th the advance was resumed and was destined to reach the extreme
point which it attained for many a long laborious month. This was the village
of Herlies, north-east of La Bass&eacute;e, which was attacked in the evening
by Shaw's 9th Brigade, and was carried in the dusk at the point of the bayonet
by the 1st Lincolns and the 4th Royal Fusiliers. About the same time the Scots
Fusiliers and Northumberlands had stormed Aubers. The 7th Brigade was less
fortunate at the adjoining village of Illies, where they failed to make a
lodgment, but the French cavalry on the extreme left, with the help of the 2nd
Royal Irish, captured Fromelles. The Fifth Division also came forward a little,
the right flank still on the canal, but the left bending round so as to get to
the north of La Bass&eacute;e. The 1st Devons, who had taken the place of the
Dorsets, pushed forward with such fire that they were half a mile ahead of the
Army and in great danger of being cut off, but by individual coolness and
resource they managed to get back to safety.</p>
<p>On the 18th, Sir Charles Ferguson, who had done good work with the Army from
the first gunshot of the war, was promoted to a higher rank and the command of
the Fifth Division passed over to General Morland. Thus both divisions of the
Second Corps changed their commanders within a week. On this date the infantry
of the 14th Brigade, with some of the 13th Brigade, were within eight hundred
yards of La Bass&eacute;e, but found it so strongly held that it could not be
entered, the Scottish Borderers losing heavily in a very gallant advance. The
village of Illies also remained impregnable, being strongly entrenched and
loopholed. Shaw's 9th Brigade took some of the trenches, but found their left
flank exposed, so had to withdraw nearly half a mile and to entrench. In this
little action the 1st Royal Scots Fusiliers bore the brunt of the fighting and
the losses. Eight officers and nearly 200 men of this regiment were killed or
wounded. A fresh German division came into action this day and their artillery
was stronger, so that the prospects of future advance were not particularly
encouraging. The British artillery was worked very hard, being overmatched and
yet undefeatable. The strain both upon the men and the officers was constant,
and the observation officers showed great daring and tenacity.</p>
<p>On the 19th neither the Third nor the Fifth Divisions made any appreciable
progress, but one battalion was heavily engaged and added a fresh record to its
ancient roll of valour. This was the 2nd Royal Irish under Major Daniell, who
attacked the village of Le Pilly rather forward from the British left in
co-operation with the French cavalry. The Irish infantry charged over eight
hundred yards of clear ground, carried the village by storm, and entrenched
themselves within it. This advance and charge, which was carried out with the
precision of an Aldershot field day, although 130 men fell during the movement,
is said by experienced spectators to have been a great feat of arms. The 20th
saw a strong counter-attack of the Germans, and by the evening their two flanks
had lapped round Le Pilly, pushing off on the one side the French cavalry of
Conneau, and on the other a too small detachment of the Royal Fusiliers who
were flanking the Irishmen. All day the defenders of Le Pilly were subjected to
a terrific shell-fire, and all attempts to get messages to them were
unavailing. In the evening they were surrounded, and only two or three men of
the battalion were ever seen again. The gallant Daniell fell, and it is on
record that his last audible words were a command to fix bayonets and fight to
the end, the cartridges of the battalion being at that time exhausted. A German
officer engaged in this attack and subsequently taken prisoner has deposed that
three German battalions attacked the Royal Irish, one in front and one on each
flank, after they had been heavily bombarded in enfilade. Several hundred Irish
dead and wounded were taken out of the main trench.</p>

<p class="caption">Southern End of British Line</p>
<br>
<p>There was now ample evidence that the Germans had received large
reinforcements, and that their line was too strong to be forced. The whole
object and character of the operations assumed, therefore, a new aspect. The
Second and Third Corps had swung round, describing an angle of ninety degrees,
with its pivot upon the right at the La Bass&eacute;e Canal, and by this
movement it had succeeded in placing itself upon the flank of the German force
which faced the Tenth French Army. But there was now no longer any flank, for
the German reinforcements had enabled them to prolong their line and so to turn
the action into a frontal attack by the British. Such an attack in modern
warfare can only hope for success when carried out by greatly superior numbers,
whereas the Germans were now stronger than their assailants, having been joined
by one division of the Seventh Corps, a brigade of the Third Corps, and the
whole of the Fourteenth Corps, part of which had already been engaged.</p>
<p>Third increased pressure was being felt by the Third Corps on the Lys, as
well as by the Second to the south of them; indeed, as only a few miles
intervened between the two, they may be regarded as one for these operations.
We have seen that, having taken the town of Bailleul, Pulteney's Corps had
established itself across the Lys, and occupied a line from Warneton to
Radinghem upon October 18. The latter village had been taken on that day by the
16th Brigade in an action in which the 1st Buffs and 2nd York and Lancasters
lost heavily, the latter being ambushed as it pursued the enemy and losing 11
officers and 400 men. Colonel Cobbold fell back upon the village and held it
successfully. Pulteney was now strongly attacked, and there was a movement of
the Germans on October 20 as if to turn his right and slip in between the two
British corps. The action was carried on into the 21st, the enemy still showing
considerable energy and strength. The chief German advance during the day was
north of La Bass&eacute;e. It came upon the village of Lorgies, which was the
point where the South Lancashires, of McCracken's 7th Brigade, forming the
extreme right of the Third Division, were in touch with the East Surreys and
Duke of Cornwall's of the 14th Brigade, forming the extreme left of the Fifth
Division. It is necessary to join one's flats carefully in the presence of the
Germans, for they are sharp critics of such matters. In this instance a sudden
attack near Illies drove in a portion of the 2nd South Lancashires. This attack
also destroyed the greater part of a company of the 1st Cornwalls in support.
An ugly gap was left in the line, but the remainder of the Cornwalls, with the
help of a company of the 1st West Kents and the ever-constant artillery, filled
it up during the rest of the day, and the 2nd Yorkshire Light Infantry took it
over the same night, the Cornishmen retiring with heavy losses but a great deal
of compensating glory. The temporary gap in the line exposed the right flank of
the 3rd Worcesters, who were next to the South Lancashires. They lost heavily
in killed and wounded, their colonel, Stuart, being among the latter, though
his injury did not prevent him from remaining in the battle line. Apart from
this action at Lorgies, the 19th Brigade (Gordon's), upon the flank of
Pulteney's Corps, sustained a very heavy attack, being driven back for some
distance. It had been ordered to occupy Fromelles, and so close the gap which
existed at that time between the left of the Second and the right of the Third
Corps, situated respectively at Aubers and Radinghem. The chief fighting
occurred at the village of Le Maisnil, close to Fromelles. This village was
occupied by the 2nd Argylls and half the 1st Middlesex, but they were driven
out by a severe shell-fire followed by an infantry advance. The brigade fell
back in good order, the regiments engaged having lost about 300 men. They took
up a position on the right of the 16th Infantry Brigade at La Boutillerie, and
there they remained until November 17, one severe attack falling upon them on
October 29, which is described under that date.</p>
<p>On the morning of October 22 the Germans, still very numerous and full of
fight, made a determined attack upon the Fifth Division, occupying the village
of Violaines, close to La Bass&eacute;e. The village was held by the 1st
Cheshires, who, for the second time in this campaign, found themselves in a
terribly difficult position. It is typical of the insolent high spirits of the
men, in spite of all that they had endured, that upon the Germans charging
forward with a war-cry which resembled, "Yip, Yip, Yip!" the British infantry
joined in with "I-addy-ti-ay!"&mdash;the whole forming the chorus of a once
popular Gaiety song. The Cheshires inflicted heavy losses upon the stormers
with rifle-fire, but were at last driven out, involving in their retirement the
1st Dorsets, who had left their own trenches in order to help them. Both
regiments, but especially the Cheshires, had grievous losses, in casualties and
prisoners. On advancing in pursuit the Germans were strongly counter-attacked
by the 2nd Manchesters and the 1st Cornwalls, supported by the 3rd Worcesters,
who, by their steady fire, brought them to a standstill, but were unable to
recover the ground that had been lost, though the Cornwalls, who had been
fighting with hardly a pause for forty-eight hours, succeeded in capturing one
of their machine-guns. In the night the British withdrew their line in
accordance with the general rearrangement to be described. Some rearguard
stragglers at break of day had the amusing experience of seeing the Germans
making a valiant and very noisy attack upon the abandoned and empty
trenches.</p>
<p>On this date, October 22, not only had Smith-Dorrien experienced this
hold-up upon his right flank, but his left flank had become more vulnerable,
because the French had been heavily attacked at Fromelles, and had been driven
out of that village. An equilibrium had been established between attack and
defence, and the position of the Aisne was beginning to appear once again upon
the edge of Flanders. General Smith-Dorrien, feeling that any substantial
advance was no longer to be hoped for under the existing conditions, marked
down and occupied a strong defensive position, from Givenchy on the south to
Fauquissart on the north. This involved a retirement of the whole corps during
the night for a distance of from one to two miles, but it gave a connected
position with a clear field of fire. At the same time the general situation was
greatly strengthened by the arrival at the front of the Lahore Division of the
Indian Army under General Watkis. These fine troops were placed in reserve
behind the Second Corps in the neighbourhood of Locon.</p>
<p>It is well to remember at this point what Smith-Dorrien's troops had already
endured during the two months that the campaign had lasted. Taking the strength
of the corps at 37,000 men, they had lost, roughly, 10,000 men in August,
10,000 in September, and 5000 up to date in these actions of October. It is
certain that far less than 50 per cent of the original officers and men were
still with the Colours, and drafts can never fully restore the unity and spirit
of a homogeneous regiment, where every man knows his company leaders and his
platoon. In addition to this they had now fought night and day for nearly a
fortnight, with broken and insufficient sleep, laying down their rifles to pick
up their spades, and then once again exchanging spade for rifle, while soaked
to the skin with incessant fogs and rain, and exposed to that most harassing
form of fighting, where every clump and hedgerow covers an enemy. They were so
exhausted that they could hardly be woken up to fight. To say that they were
now nearing the end of their strength and badly in need of a rest is but to say
that they were mortal men and had reached the physical limits that mortality
must impose.</p>
<p>The French cavalry divisions acting as links between Pulteney and
Smith-Dorrien were now relieved by the 8th (Jullundur) Indian Infantry Brigade,
containing the 1st Manchesters, 59th (Scinde) Rifles, 15th and 47th Sikhs. It
may be remarked that each Indian brigade is made up of three Indian and one
British battalion. This change was effected upon October 24, a date which was
marked by no particular military event save that the Third Division lost for a
time the services of General Beauchamp Doran, who returned to England. General
Doran had done great service in leading what was perhaps the most hard-worked
brigade in a hard-worked division. General Bowes took over the command of the
8th Infantry Brigade.</p>
<p>On the night of October 24 determined attacks were made upon the trenches of
the Second Corps at the Bois de Biez, near Neuve Chapelle, but were beaten off
with heavy loss to the enemy, who had massed together twelve battalions in
order to rush a particular part of the position. The main attack fell upon the
1st Wiltshires and the 2nd Royal Irish Rifles, belonging to McCracken's 7th
Brigade, and also upon the 15th Sikhs, who seem to have been the first Indians
to be seriously engaged, having nearly two hundred casualties. The 8th Brigade
were also involved in the fight. The Germans had some temporary success in the
centre of the trenches of the Third Division, where, in the darkness, they
pushed back the 1st Gordon Highlanders, who lost very heavily. As the
Highlanders fell back, the 2nd Royal Scots, upon their right, swung back its
flank companies, covered the retirement, and then, straightening their ranks
again, flung the Germans, at the point of their bayonets, out of the trenches.
It was one of several remarkable feats which this fine battalion has performed
in the war. Next morning the captured trenches were handed over to the care of
the 4th Middlesex.</p>
<p>The pressure upon the exhausted troops was extreme upon this day, for a very
severe attack was made also upon the Fifth Division, holding the right of the
line. The soldiers, as already shown, were in no condition for great exertions,
and yet, after their wont, they rose grandly to the occasion. The important
village of Givenchy, destined for many a long month to form the advanced post
upon the right of the Army, was held by the 1st Norfolks and 1st Devons, who
defied all efforts of the enemy to dislodge them.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the situation was critical and difficult for both divisions,
and the only available support, the 1st Manchesters from the Lahore Division,
were pushed up into the fighting line and found themselves instantly engaged in
the neighbourhood of Givenchy. It was dreadful weather, the trenches a
quagmire, and the rifle-bolts often clogged with the mud. On the 26th Sir John
French, realising how great was the task with which the weary corps was faced,
sent up two batteries of 47 guns, which soon lessened the volume of the German
artillery attack. At the same time General Maistre, of the Twenty-first French
Corps, sent two of his batteries and two of his battalions. Thus strengthened,
there was no further immediate anxiety as to the line being broken, especially
as upon the 26th Marshal French, carefully playing card after card from his not
over-strong hand, placed the Second Cavalry Division and three more Indian
battalions in reserve to Smith-Dorrien's corps. The German advance had by no
means spent itself, as on this day they came to close grips with the 2nd Irish
Rifles and established themselves firmly in the village of Neuve Chapelle, near
the centre of the British line, inflicting heavy loss upon the Royal Fusiliers,
who tried to restore the position. A number of attacks were made to regain this
village next day, in which as strange a medley of troops were employed as could
ever before have found themselves as comrades in so minor an operation. There
were South Lancashires, Royal Fusiliers, 9th Bhopal Infantry, 47th Sikhs,
Chasseurs Alpins, and other units. In spite of&mdash;or possibly on account
of&mdash;this international competition the village remained with the Germans,
who were strongly reinforced, and managed by their shell-fire to clear some of
the nearest trenches and gain some additional ground, hitting the 1st
Wiltshires and 2nd Irish Rifles hard and making a number of prisoners, two or
three hundred in all. Again the times had become critical, the more so as the
8th Indian Brigade to the north had also been attacked and roughly handled.</p>
<p>The indomitable Smith-Dorrien was determined to have his village, however,
and in the neighbouring French cavalry commander, General Conneau, he found a
worthy colleague who was ready to throw his last man into the venture. The
Second Cavalry, now under General Mullens, was also ready, as our cavalry has
always been, to spring in as a makeweight when the balance trembled. The German
losses were known to have been tremendous, and it was hoped that the force of
their attack was spent. On the 28th the assault was renewed, prefaced by a
strong artillery preparation, but again it was brought to a standstill. The
47th Sikhs fought magnificently from loopholed house to house, as did the
Indian sappers and miners, while the cavalry showed themselves to be admirable
infantry at a pinch, but the defence was still too strong and the losses too
severe, though at one time Colonel McMahon, with his Fusiliers, had seized the
whole north end of the village.</p>
<p>Some 60 officers and 1500 men had fallen in the day's venture, including 70
of the cavalry. The night fell with Neuve Chapelle still in the hands of the
enemy, and the British troops to the north, east, and west of it in a
semicircle. The 14th Brigade, coming up after dark, found the 1st West Kent
Regiment reduced to 2 officers and 150 men, and the 2nd Yorkshire Light
Infantry at about the same strength, still holding on to positions which had
been committed to them three days before. The conduct of these two grand
regiments upon that and the previous days excited the admiration of every one,
for, isolated from their comrades, they had beaten off a long succession of
infantry attacks and had been enfiladed by a most severe shell-fire.
Second-Lieutenant White, with a still younger officer named Russell, formed the
whole staff of officers of the West Kents. Major Buckle, Captain Legard, and
many others having been killed or wounded, Penny and Crossley, the two
sergeant-majors, did great work, and the men were splendid. These shire
regiments, raised from the very soil of England, reflect most nearly her
national qualities, and in their stolid invincibility form a fitting framework
of a great national army. Speaking to the West Kents of this episode, General
Smith-Dorrien said: "There is one part of the line which has never been
retaken, because it was never lost. It was the particular trenches which your
battalion held so grimly during those terrific ten days."</p>
<p>These determined efforts were not spent in vain, for the Germans would not
bide the other brunt. Early on the 29th the British patrols found that Neuve
Chapelle had been evacuated by the enemy, who must have lost several thousand
men in its capture and fine subsequent defence. In this village fighting the
British were much handicapped at this time by the want of high explosive shells
to destroy the houses. The enemy's artillery made it impossible for the British
to occupy it, and some time later it reverted to the Germans once more, being
occupied by the Seventh Westphalian Corps. It was made an exceedingly strong
advance position by the Germans, but it was reoccupied by the British Fourth
Corps (Rawlinson's) and the Indian Corps (Willcocks') upon March 10 in an
assault which lasted three days, and involved a loss of 12,000 men to the
attackers and at as many to the defenders. This battle will be described among
the operations of the spring of 1915, but it is mentioned now to show how
immutable were the lines between these dates.</p>

<p class="caption">General View of Seat of Operations</p>
<br>
<p>The southern or La Bass&eacute;e end of the line had also been attacked upon
the 28th and 29th, and the 2nd Manchesters driven from their trenches, which
they instantly regained, killing seventy of the enemy and taking a number of
prisoners. It was in this action that Lieutenant Leach and Sergeant Hogan
earned the V.C., capturing a trench at the head of ten volunteers and disposing
of some fifty Germans. Morland's Fifth Division had several other skirmishes
during these days, in which the Duke of Cornwall's, Manchesters, and 1st
Devons, who had taken the place of the Suffolks in the 14th Brigade, were
chiefly engaged. The Devons had come late, but they had been constantly engaged
and their losses were already as great as the others. For sixteen days they had
held on with desperate resolution, their Colonel Gloster and a considerable
proportion of the officers and men being hit. When they were at last relieved
they received the applause of the Army. On the whole, the general line was
held, though the price was often severe. At this period General Wing took
command of the Third Division instead of General Mackenzie &mdash;invalided
home&mdash;the third divisional change within a fortnight.</p>
<p>The arduous month of October was now drawing to a close, and so it was hoped
were the labours of the weary Second Corps. Already, on the top of all their
previous casualties, they had lost 360 officers and 8200 men since on October
12 they had crossed the La Bass&eacute;e Canal. The spirit of the men was
unimpaired for the most part&mdash;indeed, it seemed often to rise with the
emergency&mdash;but the thinning of the ranks, the incessant labour, and the
want of sleep had produced extreme physical exhaustion. Upon October 29 it was
determined to take them out of the front line and give them the rest which they
so badly needed. With this end in view, Sir James Willcocks' Indian Corps was
moved to the front, and it was gradually substituted for the attenuated
regiments of the Second Corps in the first row of trenches. The greater part of
the corps was drawn out of the line, leaving two brigades and most of the
artillery behind to support the Indians. That the latter would have some hard
work was speedily apparent, as upon this very day the 8th Gurkhas were driven
out of their trenches. With the support of a British battalion, however, and of
Vaughan's Indian Rifles they were soon recovered, though Colonel Venner of the
latter corps fell in the attack. This warfare of unseen enemies and enormous
explosions was new to the gallant Indians, but they soon accommodated
themselves to it, and moderated the imprudent gallantry which exposed them at
first to unnecessary loss.</p>
<p>Here, at the end of October, we may leave the Second Corps. It was speedily
apparent that their services were too essential to be spared, and that their
rest would be a very nominal one. The Third Corps will be treated presently.
They did admirably all that came to them to do, but they were so placed that
both flanks were covered by British troops, and they were less exposed to
pressure than the others. The month closed with this corps and the Indians
holding a line which extended north and south for about twenty miles from
Givenchy and Festubert in the south to Warneton in the north. We will return to
the operations in this region, but must turn back a fortnight or so in order to
follow the very critical and important events which had been proceeding in the
north. Before doing so it would be well to see what had befallen the cavalry,
which, when last mentioned, had, upon October 11, cleared the woods in front of
the Second Corps and connected it up with the right wing of the Third Corps.
This was carried out by Gough's Second Cavalry Division, which was joined next
day by De Lisle' s First Division, the whole under General Allenby. This
considerable force moved north upon October 12 and 13, pushing back a light
fringe of the enemy and having one brisk skirmish at Mont des Cats, a small
hill, crowned by a monastery, where the body of a Prince of Hesse was picked up
after the action. Still fighting its way, the cavalry moved north to Berthen
and then turned eastwards towards the Lys to explore the strength of the enemy
and the passages of the river in that direction. Late at night upon the 14th
General de Lisle, scouting northwards upon a motor-car, met Prince Alexander of
Teck coming southwards, the first contact with the isolated Seventh
Division.</p>
<p>On the night of the 16th an attempt was made upon Warneton, where the
Germans had a bridge over the river, but the village was too strongly held. The
3rd Cavalry Brigade was engaged in the enterprise, and the 16th Lancers was the
particular regiment upon whom it fell. The main street of the village was
traversed by a barricade and the houses loopholed. The Germans were driven by
the dismounted troopers, led by Major Campbell, from the first barricade, but
took refuge behind a second one, where they were strongly reinforced. The
village had been set on fire, and the fighting went on by the glare of the
flames. When the order for retirement was at last given it was found that
several wounded Lancers had been left close to the German barricade. The fire
having died down, three of the Lancers&mdash;Sergeant Glasgow, Corporal Boyton,
and Corporal Chapman&mdash;stole down the dark side of the street in their
stockinged feet and carried some of their comrades off under the very noses of
the Germans. Many, however, had to be left behind. It is impossible for cavalry
to be pushful and efficient without taking constant risks which must
occasionally materialise. The general effect of the cavalry operations was to
reconnoitre thoroughly all the west side of the river and to show that the
enemy were in firm possession of the eastern bank.</p>
<p>From this time onwards until the end of the month the cavalry were engaged
in carrying on the north and south line of defensive trenches, which, beginning
with the right of the Second Corps (now replaced by Indians) at Givenchy, was
prolonged by the Third Corps as far as Frelingham. There the cavalry took it up
and carried it through Comines to Wervicq, following the bend of the river.
These lines were at once strongly attacked, but the dismounted troopers held
their positions. On October 22 the 12th Lancers were heavily assaulted, but
with the aid of an enfilading fire from the 5th Lancers drove off the enemy.
That evening saw four more attacks, all of them repulsed, but so serious that
Indian troops were brought up to support the cavalry. Every day brought its
attack until they culminated in the great and critical fight from October 30 to
November 2, which will be described later. The line was held, though with some
loss of ground and occasional set-backs, until November 2, when considerable
French reinforcements arrived upon the scene. It is a fact that for all these
weeks the position which was held in the face of incessant attack by two weak
cavalry divisions should have been, and eventually was, held by two army
corps.</p>
<p>It is necessary now to briefly sketch the movements of the Third Corps
(Pulteney's). Its presence upon the left flank of the Second Corps, and the
fact that it held every attack that came against it, made it a vital factor in
the operations. It is true that, having staunch British forces upon each flank,
its position was always less precarious than either of the two corps which held
the southern and northern extremities of the line, for without any
disparagement to our Allies, who have shown themselves to be the bravest of the
brave, it is evident that we can depend more upon troops who are under the same
command, and whose movements can be certainly co-ordinated. At the same time,
if the Third Corps had less to do, it can at least say that whatever did come
to it was excellently well done, and that it preserved its line throughout. Its
units were extended over some twelve miles of country, and it was partly
astride of the River Lys, so that here as elsewhere there was constant demand
upon the vigilance and staunchness of officers and men. On October 20 a very
severe attack fell upon the 2nd Sherwood Foresters, who held the most advanced
trenches of Congreve's 18th Brigade. They were nearly overwhelmed by the
violence of the German artillery fire, and were enfiladed on each side by
infantry and machine-guns. The 2nd Durhams came up in reinforcement, but the
Foresters had already sustained grievous losses in casualties and prisoners,
the battalion being reduced from 900 to 250 in a single day. The Durhams also
lost heavily. On this same day, the 20th, the 2nd Leinsters, of the 17th
Brigade, were also driven from their trenches and suffered severely.</p>
<p>On October 21 the Germans crossed the River Lys in considerable force, and
upon the morning of the 22nd they succeeded in occupying the village of Le
Gheir upon the western side, thus threatening to outflank the positions of the
Second Cavalry Division to the north. In their advance in the early morning of
the 22nd they stormed the trenches held by the 2nd Inniskilling Fusiliers, this
regiment enduring considerable losses. The trenches on the right were held by
the 1st Royal Lancasters and 2nd Lancashire Fusiliers. These two regiments were
at once ordered by General Anley, of the 12th Brigade, to initiate a
counter-attack under the lead of Colonel Butler. Anley himself, who is a
hard-bitten soldier of much Egyptian fighting, moved forward his men, while
General Hunter-Weston, the indefatigable blower-up of railway lines in South
Africa, supported the counterattack with the Somerset Light Infantry and the
1st East Lancashires. The latter regiment, under Colonel Lawrence, passed
through a wood and reached such a position that they were able to enfilade the
Germans in the open, causing them very heavy losses. The action was a brilliant
success. The positions lost were reoccupied and the enemy severely punished,
over a thousand Germans being killed or wounded, while 300 were taken
prisoners. These belonged to the 104th and 179th Saxon regiments. It was a
strange turn of fate which, after fifteen hundred years, brought tribesmen who
had wandered up the course of the Elbe face to face in deadly strife with
fellow-tribesmen who had passed over the sea to Britain. It is worth remarking
and remembering that they are the one section of the German race who in this
war have shown that bravery is not necessarily accompanied by coarseness and
brutality.</p>
<p>On October 25 the attacks became most severe upon the line of Williams' 16th
Brigade, and on that night the trenches of the 1st Leicesters were raked by so
heavy a gunfire that they were found to be untenable, the regiment losing 350
men. The line both of the 16th and of the 18th Brigades was drawn back for some
little distance. There was a lull after this, broken upon the 29th, when
Gordon's 19th Brigade was attacked with great violence by six fresh
battalions&mdash;heavy odds against the four weak battalions which composed the
British Brigade. The 1st Middlesex Regiment was driven from part of its
trenches, but came back with a rush, helped by their comrades of the 2nd Argyll
and Sutherland Highlanders. The Germans were thrown out of the captured
trenches, 40 were made prisoners, and 200 were slain. This attack was made by
the 223rd and 224th Regiments of the XXIV. German Reserve Corps. It was not
repeated.</p>
<p>On the 30th another sharp action occurred near St. Yves, when
Hunter-Weston's 11th Brigade was momentarily pierced after dusk by a German
rush, which broke through a gap in the Hampshires. The Somerset Light Infantry,
under Major Prowse, came back upon them and the trenches were regained. In all
such actions it is to be remembered that where a mass of men can suddenly be
directed against scattered trenches which will only hold a few, it is no
difficult matter to carry them, but at once the conditions reverse themselves
and the defenders mass their supports, who can usually turn the intruders out
once more.</p>
<p>This brings the general record of the doings of the Third Corps down to the
end of October, the date on which we cease the account of the operations at the
southern end of the British line. We turn from this diffuse and difficult
story, with its ever-varying positions and units, to the great epic of the
north, which will be inseparably united for ever with the name of Ypres.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that in an army where every division had done so
well no single one was composed of such fine material as the Seventh. The
reason was that the regiments composing it had all been drawn from foreign
garrison duty, and consisted largely of soldiers of from three to seven years'
standing, with a minimum of reservists. In less than a month from the day when
this grand division of 18,000 men went into action its infantry had been nearly
annihilated, but the details of its glorious destruction furnish one more vivid
page of British military achievement. We lost a noble division and gained a
glorious record.</p>
<p>The Third Cavalry Division under General Byng was attached to the Seventh
Division, and joined up with it at Roulers upon October 13. It consisted of:

<p>The First Army Corps not having yet come up from the Aisne, these troops
were used to cover the British position from the north, the infantry lying from
Zandvoorde through Gheluvelt to Zonnebeke, and the cavalry on their left from
Zonnebeke to Langemarck from October 16 onwards. It was decided by Sir John
French that it was necessary to get possession of the town of Menin, some
distance to the east of the general British line, but very important because
the chief bridge, by means of which the Germans were receiving their
ever-growing reinforcements, was there. The Seventh Division was ordered
accordingly to advance upon this town, its left flank being covered by the
Third Cavalry Division.</p>
<p>The position was a dangerous one. It has already been stated that the pause
on the Aisne may not have been unwelcome to the Germans, as they were preparing
reserve formations which might be suddenly thrown against some chosen spot in
the Allied line. They had the equipment and arms for at least another 250,000
men, and that number of drilled men were immediately available, some being
Landwehr who had passed through the ranks, and others young formations which
had been preparing when war broke out. Together they formed no less than five
new army corps, available for the extreme western front, more numerous than the
whole British and Belgian armies combined. This considerable force, secretly
assembled and moving rapidly across Belgium, was now striking the north of the
Allied line, debouching not only over the river at Menin, but also through
Courtrai, Iseghem, and Roulers. It consisted of the 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 26th, and
27th reserve corps. Of these the 22nd, and later the 24th, followed the
Belgians to the line of the Yser, but the other corps were all available for an
attack upon the flank of that British line which was faced by formidable
opponents&mdash;a line which extended over thirty miles and had already been
forced into a defensive attitude.</p>
<br>
<div align="center"><a id="img12" name="img12"><img src=
"12-Doyle-British-Campaign/H241-12.jpg" title=
"Line of Seventh Division and Third Cavalry"></a></div>
<p class="caption">Line of Seventh Division and Third Cavalry</p>
<br>
<p>That was the situation when the Seventh Division faced round near Ypres. Sir
John French was doing all that he could to support it, and Sir Douglas Haig was
speeding up his army corps from the Aisne to take his place to the north of
Ypres, but there were some days during which Rawlinson's men were in the face
of a force six or seven times larger than themselves.</p>
<p>Upon October 16th and 17th the division had advanced from Ypres and occupied
the line already mentioned, the right centre of which rested about the ninth
kilometre on the Ypres-Menin road, the order of the brigades from the north
being 22nd, 21st, and 20th. On October 18 the division wheeled its left
forward. As the infantry advanced, the covering cavalry soon became aware of
grave menace from Roulers and Courtrai in the north. A large German force was
evidently striking down on to the left flank of the advance. The division was
engaged all along the line, for the 20th Brigade upon the right had a brisk
skirmish, while the 21st Brigade in the centre was also under fire, which came
especially heavily upon the 2nd Bedfords, who had numerous casualties. About
ten o'clock on the morning of the 19th the pressure from the north increased,
and the 7th Cavalry Brigade was driven in, though it held its own with great
resolution for some time, helped by the fine work of K Battery, R.H.A. The 6th
Cavalry Brigade was held up in front, while the danger on the flank grew more
apparent as the hours passed. In these circumstances General Rawlinson,
fortified in his opinion by the precise reports of his airmen as to the
strength of the enemy upon his left, came to the conclusion that a further
advance would place him in a difficult position. He therefore dropped back to
his original line. There can be little doubt that, if he had persevered in the
original plan, his force would have been in extreme danger. As it was, before
he could get it back the 1st Welsh Fusiliers were hard hit, this famous
regiment losing a major, 5 captains, 3 lieutenants, and about 200 men. The
order to retire had failed to reach it, and but for the able handling of
Colonel Cadogan it might well have been destroyed.</p>
<p>On October 20, the situation being still obscure, the 20th Brigade carried
out a reconnaissance towards Menin. The 2nd Wilts and 2nd Scots Fusiliers, of
the 21st Brigade, covered their left flank. The enemy, however, made a vigorous
attack upon the 22nd Brigade to the north, especially upon the Welsh Fusiliers,
so the reconnaissance had to fall back again, the 1st Grenadier Guards
sustaining some losses. The two covering regiments were also hard pressed,
especially the Wiltshires, who were again attacked during the night, but
repulsed their assailants.</p>
<p>From this time onwards the Seventh Division was to feel ever more and more
the increasing pressure as the German army corps from day to day brought their
weight to bear upon a thin extended line of positions held by a single
division. It will be shown that they were speedily reinforced by the First
Corps, but even after its advent the Germans were still able to greatly
outnumber the British force. The story from this time onwards is one of
incessant and desperate attacks by day and often by night. At first the
division was holding the position alone, with the help of their attendant
cavalry, and their instructions were to hold on to the last man until help
could reach them. In the case of some units these instructions were literally
fulfilled. One great advantage lay with the British. They were first-class
trained soldiers, the flower of the Army, while their opponents, however
numerous, were of the newly raised reserve corps, which showed no lack of
bravery, but contained a large proportion of youths and elderly men in the
ranks. Letters from the combatants have described the surprise and even pity
which filled the minds of the British when they saw the stormers hesitate upon
the edge of the trenches which they had so bravely approached, and stare down
into them uncertain what they should do. But though the ascendancy of the
British infantry was so great that they could afford to disregard the
inequality of numbers, it was very different with the artillery. The German
gunners were as good as ever, and their guns as powerful as they were numerous.
The British had no howitzer batteries at all with this division, while the
Germans had many. It was the batteries which caused the terrific losses. It may
be that the Seventh Division, having had no previous experience in the
campaign, had sited their trenches with less cunning than would have been shown
by troops who had already faced the problem of how best to avoid high
explosives.</p>
<p>Either by sight or by aeroplane report the Germans got the absolute range of
some portions of the British position, pitching their heavy shells exactly into
the trenches, and either blowing the inmates to pieces or else burying them
alive, so that in a little time the straight line of the trench was entirely
lost, and became a series of ragged pits and mounds. The head-cover for
shrapnel was useless before such missiles, and there was nothing for it but
either to evacuate the line or to hang on and suffer. The Seventh Division hung
on and suffered, but no soldiers can ever have been exposed to a more deadly
ordeal. When they were at last relieved by the arrival of reinforcements and
the consequent contraction of the line, they were at the last pitch of
exhaustion, indomitable in spirit, but so reduced by their losses and by the
terrific nervous strain that they could hardly have held out much longer.</p>
<p>A short account has been given of what occurred to the division up to
October 20. It will now be carried on for a few days, after which the narrative
must turn to the First Corps, and show why and how they came into action to the
north of the hard-pressed division. It is impossible to tell the two stories
simultaneously, and so it may now be merely mentioned that from October 21
Haig's Corps was on the left, and that those operations which will shortly be
described covered the left wing of the division, and took over a portion of
that huge German attack which would undoubtedly have overwhelmed the smaller
unit had it not been for this addition of strength. It is necessary to get a
true view of the operations, for it is safe to say that they are destined for
immortality, and will be recounted so long as British history is handed down
from one generation to another.</p>
<p>On the 21st the enemy got a true conception of the salient in front of the
Seventh Division, and opened a vigorous attack, which lasted all day and
assumed several different phases at different points. The feature of the
morning of the 21st was the severe and, indeed, disastrous artillery fire upon
Lawford's 22nd Brigade. The exact range of the British position seems to have
been discovered with deadly results. Men, trenches, and machine-guns were all
blown to pieces together. The 2nd Warwicks and the 1st Welsh Fusiliers were the
two battalions upon which the storm beat hardest, and each of them had some
hundreds of casualties. In three days the Welsh Fusiliers, who were on the
exposed left flank, lost three-quarters of their effectives, including twenty
three of their officers, and yet preserved their military spirit. It became
clearer as experience accumulated that the best trenches, if they are once
fairly located, can be made untenable or turned into the graves of their
occupants by the use of high explosives. The German fire was so severe that it
was reckoned that one hundred and twenty shells an hour into or round a trench
was a not uncommon rate of fall. The 2nd Queen's also lost seven officers and
many men in this day's fighting. In spite of the heavy losses from gunfire the
German infantry could make no progress, being held up by a flanking fire of the
South Staffords. In the afternoon of October 21 a strong attack was made upon
the 21st Brigade in the centre of the line. The brigade was holding a front of
two and a half miles, and, although the attack was generally beaten back, a
certain number of stormers got through between the trenches and into the woods
beyond. Here they lurked for a couple of days, during which time the 2nd
Yorkshire Regiment, behind whose line they were lying, were often compelled to
have each alternate man facing a different way to keep down the fire. The
battalion sent itself reinforcements by hurrying its right company over to help
to clear its left. This movement was successful, but was attended with heavy
losses, including several officers. Some of the Royal Scots Fusiliers had been
forced out of their trenches on the right, and made, under Major Ian Forbes, a
gallant attempt to re-establish them, in which Captain Fairlie and many men
were lost. The Wiltshires also endured a very severe attack, which they
repulsed with great loss to the enemy. On this same eventful day, the 21st, the
Second Cavalry Division had been pushed back at Holbeke, and the Germans got
round the right flank of the hard-pressed infantry. It was then that General
Rawlinson brought his Third Cavalry Division round and established it upon his
right instead of his left flank. From this time until October 30 this cavalry
division was holding Zandvoorde Ridge, sharing day by day in all the perils and
the glories of their comrades of the Seventh Division. There was no more
dangerous point than that which was held by the cavalry, and their losses,
especially those of the 10th Hussars, were in proportion to the danger. In the
course of a few days the Hussars lost Colonel Barnes, Majors Mitford and
Crichton and many officers and men.</p>
<p>On October 22 the Second Division of Haig's First Corps, which had been
fully occupied to the north with operations which will presently be described,
moved down to cover the ground vacated by the Third Cavalry Division and to
relieve the pressure upon the infantry of the Seventh Division. The 4th Guards
Brigade took its position upon their immediate left. It was time. For four days
they had covered the enormous front of eight miles against at least four times
their own number, with more than six times their weight of artillery. It was
touch and go. They were nearly submerged. It was indeed a vision of joy when
the worn and desperate men, looking over their shoulders down the Ypres-Menin
road, saw the head of a British column coming swiftly to the rescue. It was the
2nd Highland Light Infantry and the 2nd Worcesters, dispatched from the 5th
Brigade, and never was reinforcement more needed. Shortly afterwards further
help in the shape of a detachment of the Munster Fusiliers, two troops of the
ever-helpful Irish Horse, and one section of artillery appeared upon the
scene.</p>
<p>Upon this date (October 22) the 22nd Infantry Brigade of the Seventh
Division had fallen back to the railway crossings near Zonnebeke. Thus the
salient which the Germans had been attacking was straightened out. Unhappily,
the change caused another smaller salient farther south, at the point which was
held by the 2nd Wiltshires. On the 22nd and 23rd there was a tremendous
shelling of this sector, which was followed on the 24th by an infantry advance,
in which the Wiltshires, who had been previously much reduced, were utterly
overwhelmed and practically destroyed. The disastrous attack broke upon the
British line just after daybreak. The enemy pushed through behind each flank of
the Wiltshires, elbowing, off the Scots Fusiliers on one side and the Scots
Guards on the other. The Germans got in force into the Polygon Woods behind.
There were no reserves available save the Northumberland Hussars, a corps which
has the honour of being the first British territorial corps to fight for its
country. With the aid of some divisional cyclists, this handful of men held
back the Germans until the 2nd Warwicks from the north were brought to stem the
advance. The Warwicks charged through the wood, their gallant Colonel Loring
riding his horse beside them without boot or legging, having been wounded some
days before. "Where my men go I go as well," was his answer to medical
remonstrance. He was killed by a bullet, but he died at a moment of victory,
for his last earthly vision was that of his infantry driving the last Germans
out of the wood. Besides their colonel, the regiment lost many officers and men
in this fine advance, which was most vigorously supported by the 2nd
Worcesters, the only reinforcement within reach. The Worcesters lost 6 officers
and 160 men, but did much execution and took a number of prisoners.</p>
<p>At this time the 20th Brigade, being the extreme Hard fight right of the
Seventh Division, held an extended line Brigade. from Kruiseik cross-roads,
about a mile east of Gheluvelt village, to near Zandvoorde, with a salient at
the village of Kruiseik. On the night of the 25th the Germans planned a furious
attack upon the whole salient. The assailants, who were mostly Saxons, broke
through the 2nd Scots Guards just north of Kruiseik and got behind the line,
which was pushed back for some distance, though Captain Paynter, with the
right-hand company, held his position. A counter-attack by the Guards retook
the line, together with 200 prisoners, including 7 officers. On the morning of
the 26th the Germans were back on them, however, and began by blowing in the
trenches of the Border Regiment south of Kruiseik. The German guns had found
the exact range of the trenches, and the defenders had the same terrible and
intolerable experience which had befallen some of their comrades two days
before. It was simply impossible to stand up against the incessant shower of
shattering shells. So great was the concussion and the nervous strain that many
of the men exposed to it got completely dazed or even became delirious.
Grenadiers, Scots Guards, and South Staffords, of the 20th Brigade, held the
line until the front trenches were carried by the Germans and many of the
occupants made prisoners. It was pitch dark, and it was impossible to tell
friend from foe. Major Fraser of the Scots Guards, going forward to
reconnoitre, was shot dead and his party was destroyed. A house in a field
taken by the Guards yielded no fewer than 200 prisoners, but in the confused
fighting in the darkness our losses were greater than our gains. It was in this
night-fighting that Lord Dalrymple, Colonel Bolton, and other officers, with
some hundreds of men, fell into the hands of the enemy after a most heroic
resistance to overpowering numbers and to a weight of artillery which was
crushing in its effect. The King's Company of the 1st Grenadiers was isolated
and in great danger, but managed to link up with the British line. The 1st
South Staffords also lost some hundreds of men, and was only saved by fine
handling on the part of Colonel Ovens. Kruiseik was abandoned, and a new line
taken up half a mile farther back. It was a critical night, during which the
energy and firmness of General Capper were splendidly employed in reforming and
stiffening his sorely tried division. On the 26th the 20th Brigade, which had
been so heavily hit the day before, was drawn out of the line for a rest, and
the two other brigades closed up to cover a shorter line. The work of the 20th
at Kruiseik had been magnificent, but their losses were appalling, including
their Brigadier, Ruggles-Brise, who was wounded. Here, for the instant, we
shall leave the Seventh Division, though their ordeal was by no means done, and
we shall turn to those other forces which had been forming in the northern or
Ypres section of the long battle line.</p>
<p>The reader will remember, if he casts his mind back, that the whole British
line, as it extended from the south about October 18, consisted of the Second
Corps and the advance guard of the Indians near La Bass&eacute;e; then, in
succession, the Third Corps in the Armenti&egrave;res district, the First
Cavalry and Second Cavalry near Messines and Wytschaete, the Seventh Division
near Gheluvelt, and finally the Third Cavalry on their left, joining up with
the French, who carried the line to where the Belgians were reforming on the
Yser. The First Corps had detrained from the Aisne, and was concentrated
between St. Omer and Hazebrouck upon October 18 and 19. They represented a last
British reserve of about thirty-five thousand men to set against the large new
armies who were advancing from the north. The urgent question to be decided was
where they should be placed, since there were so many points which needed
reinforcement.</p>
<p>Sir John French has explained in his dispatch the reasons which swayed him
in deciding this question.</p>
<p>"I knew," he said, "that the enemy were by this time in greatly superior
strength upon the Lys and that the Second and Third Cavalry and Fourth Corps
were holding a much wider front than their strength and numbers warranted.
Taking these facts alone into consideration, it would have appeared wise to
throw the First Corps in to strengthen the line, but this would have left the
country north and east of Ypres and the Ypres Canal open to a wide turning
movement by the Third Reserve Corps and at least one Landwehr Division which I
knew to be operating in that region. I was also aware that the enemy was
bringing large reinforcements up from the east, which could only be opposed for
several days by two or three French cavalry divisions, some French
Territorials, and the Belgian Army."</p>
<p>He proceeds to state his opinion that the Belgian Army was in no condition
to withstand unsupported such an attack, and that if it were allowed to sweep
past us it was very likely to wash away all opposition before it, and get into
the Channel ports in our rear. With this consideration in his mind. Sir John
French took the bold and dangerous, but absolutely necessary, step of leaving
the long, thin, thirty-mile line to do the best it could, and prolonging it by
another ten or twelve miles by forming up the First Corps on the same
alignment, so as to present as long a British breakwater as possible to the
oncoming flood. There was nothing else to be done, and the stronger the flood
the more need there was to do it, but it is safe to say that seldom in history
has so frail a barrier stood in the direct track of so terrible a storm.</p>
<p>In accordance with this resolution, Haig's First Corps moved, on October 20,
through Poperinghe and Ypres and took their place upon the north or left side
of the Seventh Division. On their own left in this position was the French
cavalry corps of General de Mitry, while the Third Division of British cavalry
was on their right. As the movement commenced Sir John French had a personal
interview with General Haig, in which he held out hopes that the greater part
of the new German levies had been deflected to hold our southern advance, and
that he would only find the Third Reserve Corps and some Landwehr in front of
him to the north of Ypres. His object was to advance upon the line of Bruges
and drive the enemy towards Ghent. Meanwhile the gallant little Belgian army,
which was proving itself a glutton at fighting, was entrenched along the line
of the Ypres Canal and the Yser River, where they held their own manfully in
spite of all that they had endured.</p>
<p>The first large landmark in the direction of Bruges was Thorout, and towards
this the First Corps, with the Third Cavalry Division upon its right, took its
first steps, little thinking that it was butting forward against an approaching
army of at least double its own strength. It was very quickly made to realise
its position, however, and any dreams of a victorious entry into Bruges were
speedily dispelled. Only too fortunate would it be if it could hold its own
line without retreat and disaster. Upon the 21st Haig's men attacked
Poel-Chapelle and Passchendaale, French cavalry and Territorials (the
Eighty-seventh and Eighty-ninth Divisions) under General Bidon advancing on
their left, while the Seventh Division, as already described, kept pace upon
its right. There was strong opposition from the first, but the corps advanced
in spite of it until the pressure from the north became too severe for the
French, whose flank was exposed to the full force of it.</p>
<p>The British attack upon the morning in question was planned as follows. The
Second Division was to advance upon Passchendaale. The First had orders to take
Poel-Chapelle. The latter movement was headed by the 3rd Brigade, who were
directed by General Landon to go forward about nine o'clock, the 1st Queen's
having the station for their objective while the 1st South Wales Borderers
attacked the village. The 1st Gloucesters were in reserve. The enemy met the
attack with shell-fire, which it was difficult to locate, as the country was
flat and enclosed. The progress of the movement, however, was steady though
slow. About ten o'clock there were signs of a considerable hostile infantry
advance from the north. The attack, however, made good progress up to midday,
when there was a general retirement of the French Territorials, followed later
by the French cavalry upon the British left. They moved back towards Bixschote.
The Gloucester Regiment, who had been thrown out to reinforce that flank, were
also driven back, and were in turn reinforced by the Coldstream Guards. This
battalion executed a bayonet charge in clearing the small village of Koekuit,
but later on had to retire, finding their flank exposed. It should be mentioned
that one French corps, the Seventh Cavalry Division, kept its position upon the
British left, and it is also only fair to point out that as the German advance
was mainly from the north, it was upon the left flank, covered by the French,
that it would fall. The 1st Camerons were now dispatched to the flank to
stiffen the French resistance, taking up their position near the inn which is
midway upon the road between Steenstraate and Langemarck, north of the village
of Pilken &mdash;an inn with which they were destined to have stirring
associations. With the support of the 46th Battery, the Highlanders held up a
German brigade which was thrusting through behind our main line; but farther
west, in the Steenstraate direction, the defence against a northern advance was
miserably thin, consisting only of one company of the Sussex Regiment and the
116th Battery. In the circumstances the more success Haig's troops attained in
front, and the more they advanced, the more dangerous was their position upon
the flank.</p>
<p>About 2:30 the German advance from the north became more formidable, and the
1st South Welsh Borderers, between Langemarck and Poel-Chapelle, were heavily
counter-attacked and suffered considerable loss, between two and three hundred
in all. Two companies of the 2nd Welsh were pushed up to their help. It was
clear, however, that the advance could not be continued. The 1st Brigade was
therefore ordered to hold the line between Steenstraate and Langemarck, with
their centre at the inn north of Pilken, so as to face the German advance from
the north. Then from Langemarck the British line turned southwards, being
carried on for two miles by the 3rd Brigade to hold the enemy who were coming
from the east. The 2nd Brigade was in reserve at Boesinghe. During this long
and difficult day the Second Division, operating upon the right of the First,
was not subjected to the same anxiety about its flank. It advanced upon its
objective in the face of severe opposition, ending more than once in a brief
bayonet encounter. Several counter-attacks were made by the Germans, but they
were all beaten back with loss. About two o'clock, however. the Second Division
learned of the flank pressure which was holding up the First Division, and also
of the extreme need for help experienced by the 22nd Brigade of the Seventh
Division on their right. In these circumstances it was necessary to abandon the
idea of further advance and to send south those reinforcements, the opportune
arrival of which has been already described.</p>
<p>As a net result of the two days' operations General Haig was not able to
attain the line of Passchendaale&mdash;Poel-Chapelle, as originally planned,
but he gained sufficient ground to establish himself from Langemarck to
Zonnebeke, more than half-way to his objective. The whole character of the
operations during these days was more of the familiar British type, being
conducted upon the surface of the earth rather than under it, and cavalry
making its last appearance for many a long day. Many fine deeds of valour were
done. In one of these Captain Rising, of the Gloucester Regiment, with ninety
men, defended some point with such heroic tenacity that when, some days
afterwards, the Brigadier attempted to get the names of the survivors for
commendation not one could be found. Quaintly valorous also is the picture of
Major Powell, of the North Lancashires, leading his wing with a badly-sprained
ankle, and using a cottage chair for a crutch, upon which he sat down between
rushes. It is hopeless, however, and even invidious to pick instances where the
same spirit animated all. The result was definite. It had been clearly shown
that the enemy were in considerably greater strength than had been imagined,
and instead of a rearguard action from weak forces the British found themselves
in the presence of a strong German advance. All day large forces of the enemy
were advancing from Roulers and were impinging upon different points of the
Franco-British line. These troops were composed of partially-trained men,
volunteers and reservists, but they attacked with the utmost determination, and
endured heavy losses with great bravery. It is a remarkable proof of the
elaborate preparations for war made by Germany that, behind all their original
gigantic array, they still had ready within the country sufficient arms and
uniforms to fit out these five new army corps. He who plans finds it easy to
prepare, and whoever will compare this profusion of munitions in Germany with
the absolute lack of them in the Allied countries will have no further doubt as
to which Government conspired against the peace of the world.</p>
<p>On October 21, Sir John French began to feel that there were new factors in
his front. In the evening, at a meeting with Haig and Rawlinson, he discussed
the unexpected strength of the German reinforcements and admitted that the
scheme of an advance upon Bruges would become impossible in the face of such
numbers. Intelligence reports indicated that there was already a German army
corps in front of each British division. General Joffre had promised
considerable French reinforcements upon October 24, and all that could be done
was for the British troops to hold their ground to the last man and to resist
every pressure until the equality of the forces could be restored. Could they
hold the line till then? That was the all-important question.</p>
<p>October 22 was the first day of that long ordeal of incessant attacks which
the First Corps was called upon to endure, until by constant attrition it had
become almost as worn as the Seventh Division to the south. On this day the
German attack, which attained the full volume of later days, spent itself here
and there along the extended lines. Only at one point did the enemy have some
success, which, however, was the prelude to disaster.</p>
<p>The line from Steenstraate to Langemarck, defending the British left flank,
was held by the 1st Brigade, the Scots Guards upon the extreme left, then the
Cameron Highlanders, and the Black Watch in reserve. In the middle of the line
north of Pilken was a solitary inn, already mentioned, round which trenches had
been cut in horse-shoe fashion, the concavity of the shoe pointing southwards.
This point marked the junction between the Camerons and the Scots Guards. About
3 P.M. this position was driven in and captured by a sudden and determined
advance of the enemy. The German charge was a fine feat of arms, for it was
carried out largely by <i>Einj&auml;hrige</i>, who may be roughly compared to
the Officers' Training Corps of our British system. These high-spirited lads
advanced singing patriotic songs, and succeeded in carrying the trenches in the
face of soldiers who are second to none in the British Army&mdash;soldiers,
too, who had seen much service, while the German cadets were new to the work.
The performance was much appreciated by British officers and men.</p>
<p>The Black Watch endeavoured without success to restore the line, and the 1st
Northamptons were called upon from divisional reserve, while from all parts
troops converged towards the gap. On the arrival of the Northamptons they
pushed up towards the interval which, now existed between the Scots Guards and
the remains of the Camerons, but found the gap broader than had been thought,
and strongly occupied. It was then evening, and it was thought best to delay
the counter-attack until morning and so have time to bring up reinforcements.
The 1st North Lancashires and the 2nd South Staffords were accordingly ordered
up, together with the 1st Queen's Surrey and the 2nd Rifles, the whole
operation being under the immediate command of General Bulfin. The advance
began at six in the morning, over very difficult ground which had been barb-
wired during the night. The progress was slow but steady, and at eleven o'clock
an assault upon the inn was ordered. The position was critical, since the enemy
was now firmly lodged in the very centre of the flank of the British position,
and was able to enfilade all the trenches of the First Division. The Queen's
Surrey, the 2nd King's Royal Rifles, and the 1st North Lancashires charged home
with splendid energy, capturing the trenches round the inn, besides releasing
sixty Camerons and taking over five hundred prisoners. The trenches were
carried by the North Lancashires, led by Major Carter. It was the second time
within six weeks that this battalion had made a decisive bayonet charge. The
price paid was six officers and 150 men. The inn itself was rushed by Captain
Creek's company of the Queen's, while Major Watson, of the same regiment,
organised the final advance. The fighting at this point was not finished for
the day. In the late evening the enemy, with fine tenacity of purpose, attacked
the inn once more and drove the Queen's out of a salient. The line was then
straightened on each side of the inn and remained firm. Both the attack on the
inn and the defence of the line were splendidly supported by the field
artillery.</p>
<p>Whilst the 1st Brigade had in this fashion got into and out of a dangerous
position, there had been a severe attack upon two regiments of Landon's 3rd
Brigade stationed at Langemarck. The defending units were the 2nd Welsh
Regiment and the 1st Gloucesters. Aided by a strong artillery backing, they
beat off these attacks and inflicted a very heavy loss upon the enemy. The
Allied line to the north was solid and unbroken.</p>
<p>The British losses during these operations of the First Corps amounted to
1500 men, while those of the Germans were exceedingly heavy. These
inexperienced troops advanced with an indiscriminating enthusiasm which exposed
them to severe retaliation. It is doubtful if at any time in the campaign the
British fire found so easy a mark. One thousand five hundred dead were counted
in the vicinity of Langemarck, and the total loss (including over six hundred
prisoners) could not have been less than 10,000 men. Correspondence afterwards
captured showed that the Twenty- third Reserve Corps sustained such losses that
for a time at least it was out of action. The Twenty-seventh Reserve Corps was
also hard hit. A letter from a soldier in the 246th Regiment mentions that only
eighty men were left of his battalion after the action of the 24th.</p>
<p>On October 24 and 25 the arrival of French reinforcements allowed the
British to shorten up their defensive line, which had been unduly extended. The
Seventeenth Division of the Ninth French Army Corps took over the line of the
Second Division, which was drawn back to St. Jean, and in turn took over part
of the front of the Seventh Division. French territorial troops, under General
de Mitry, relieved the First British Division on the line Hannebeke
&mdash;Ypres. Langemarck&mdash;Steenstraate. The First Division was drawn back
to Zillebeke.</p>
<p>Meantime the Second Division, having the Ninth Corps upon its left and the
Seventh Division upon its right, made an attack towards Bacelaer, taking two
guns and some prisoners. This advance was renewed upon the 26th, this being the
day upon which, as already described, the Germans pushed back the 20th Brigade
of the Seventh Division at the Kruiseik salient, creating a situation which
brought the Second Division to a standstill.</p>
<p>In this movement forward of the Second Division from October 24 to 26, the
Guards' 4th Brigade were on the right, the 6th Brigade on the left, with the
French to the left of them. The 5th Brigade were in reserve. Two small villages
were taken by storm, the Germans being driven out of loopholed houses, though
at a considerable cost of officers and men. It was in this operation that
Colonel Bannatyne, the gallant leader of the 1st King's Liverpool, was killed.
Ten other officers and several hundred men of this corps were killed or
wounded. The 1st Berkshires, fighting to the left of the King's, shared in its
losses and in its success. The Irish Guards were held up before Reutel and
separated from the rest of the force, but managed to extricate themselves after
some anxious hours.</p>
<p>On October 27, Sir John French came in person to Hooge, at the rear of the
fighting line, and inquired into the state of the hard-pressed troops. He found
the Seventh to be now such a skeleton division that it was thought best to join
it with Haig's First Corps, forming one single command.</p>
<p>The attendant Third Cavalry Division was also attached to the First Corps.
These readjustments took place upon October 27. They were, of course, of a
temporary character until the eagerly awaited Eighth Division should arrive and
so give General Rawlinson a complete Fourth Corps. At present there was a very
immediate prospect that half of it might be annihilated before the second half
appeared. The general arrangement of this section of the battlefield was now as
depicted, the Seventh Division being entirely south of the Ypres&mdash;Menin
roadway.</p>
<p>This date, the 27th, was memorable only for an advance of the 6th Brigade.
These continual advances against odds were wonderful examples of the aggressive
spirit of the British soldiers. In this instance ground was gained, but at the
cost of some casualties, especially to the 1st Rifles, who lost Prince Maurice
of Battenberg and a number of officers and men.</p>
<p>And now the great epic of the first Battle of Ypres was rising to its
climax, and the three days of supreme trial for the British Army were to begin.
Early upon October 29, a very heavy attack developed upon the line of the
Ypres-Menin road. There is a village named Gheluvelt, which is roughly half-way
upon this tragic highway. It lay now immediately behind the centre of the
British line. About half a mile in front of it the position ran through the
important cross-roads which lead to the village of Kruiseik, still in the
British possession. The line through the Kruiseik cross-roads was that which
was furiously assailed upon this morning, and the attack marked the beginning
of a great movement to drive in the front continuing throughout the 30th and
culminating in the terrible ordeal of the 31st, the crisis of the Ypres battle
and possibly of the Western campaign.</p>

"General Scene of Operations"></a></div>
<p class="caption">General Scene of Operations</p>
<br>
<p>FitzClarence's 1st Brigade lay to the north of the road, and the battered,
much-enduring 20th Brigade upon the south. They were destined together to give
such an example of military tenacity during that day as has seldom been
equalled and never exceeded, so that the fight for the Kruiseik crossroads may
well live in history amongst those actions, like Albuera and Inkermann, which
have put the powers of British infantry to an extreme test. The line was held
by about five thousand men, but no finer units were to be found in the whole
Army. The attack was conducted by an army corps with the eyes of their Emperor
and an overpowering artillery encouraging them from the rear. Many of the
defending regiments, especially those of the 20th Brigade, had already been
terribly wasted. It was a line of weary and desperate men who faced the German
onslaught.</p>
<p>The attack began in the mists of the early morning. The opening was adverse
to the British, for the enemy, pushing very boldly forward upon a narrow front
and taking full advantage of the fog, broke a way down the Menin road and
actually got past the defending line before the situation was understood. The
result was that the two regiments which flanked the road, the 1st Black Watch
and the 1st Grenadiers, were fired into from behind and endured terrible
losses. Among the Grenadiers Colonel Earle, Majors Forrester and Stucley, Lord
Richard Wellesley, and a number of other officers fell, while out of 650
privates only 150 were eventually left standing. The 2nd Gordons, upon the
right of the Grenadiers, suffered nearly as heavily, while the 1st Coldstream,
upon the left of the Black Watch, was perhaps the hardest hit of all, for at
the end of that dreadful day it had not a single officer fit for duty. The
right company of the 1st Scots Guards shared the fate of the Coldstream. The
line was pushed back for a quarter of a mile and Kruiseik was evacuated, but
the dead and wounded who remained in the trenches far exceeded in numbers those
who were able to withdraw.</p>
<p>Two small bodies who were cut off by the German advance did not fall back
with their comrades, and each of them made a splendid and successful
resistance. The one near Kruiseik was a mixed party under Major Bottomley of
the 2nd Queen's West Surrey. The other was C Company of the 2nd Gordons under
Captain B.G.R. Gordon and Lieutenant Laurence Carr. These small islands of
khaki, in the midst of a broad stream of grey, lay so tight and fired so
straight that they inflicted very great damage upon the enemy, and were able to
hold their own, in ever-diminishing numbers, until under the protection of
darkness the survivors regained the British line.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a number of small dashing counter-attacks by the
indomitable infantry was bringing the British line forward again. South of the
road the Gordons, under Colonel Uniacke, dashed themselves again and again
against the huge host which faced them, driving them back, and then in their
turn recoiling before the ponderous advance of the army corps. They were
maddened by the sound of the rolling fire ahead of them, which showed that
their own C Company was dying hard. In one of these counter-attacks Captain
Brooke brought every straggler into the fray, and died while trying to cut his
way through to his comrades. To the north of the road Captain Stephen, with the
remains of the 1st Scots Guards, threw themselves upon the German flank and
staggered it by their fire. The Germans, who had almost reached Gheluvelt, were
now worried in this way on either flank, while the 2nd Border battalion and the
Welsh Borderers with the rallied remains of the broken regiments were still
facing them in front. The enemy was held, was stricken front and flank with a
murderous fire, and recoiled back down the Menin road. Imperial eyes and
overmastering guns were equally powerless to drive them through that iron
defence. Five thousand British soldiers had driven back an army corps, but had
left more than half their number upon the scene of victory.</p>
<p>The Second Division, to the north of the road in the direction of Reutel,
had been ordered to counter-attack, and the other brigades of the Seventh
Division to the south did the same. While Haig had a man standing he was ready
to hit back. Between these two flanking forces there was a movement in the
centre to follow the Germans back and to recover some of the lost ground.
Landon's Third Brigade, less the Gloucester Regiment, was pushed forward. These
troops moved past Gheluvelt and advanced along the line of the road, the 1st
Queen's, their right-hand unit, linking up by a happy chance with their own 2nd
Battalion, who were now on the left of the 22nd Brigade of the Seventh
Division. Left of the Queen's were the 2nd Welsh to the immediate south of the
main road, while to their left again lay the 1st South Wales Borderers, in
front of the village of Gheluvelt. By evening these troops had recovered some
of the ground, but the village of Kruiseik, which had always constituted a
salient, was now abandoned. The cross-roads also remained in the hands of the
enemy. Landon's Brigade continued to bar the further German advance preparing
in stern resignation for the renewed and heavier blow which all knew to be in
readiness, and which was destined two days later to bring them a glorious
annihilation.</p>
<p>It was clear upon the evening of the 29th that serious mischief was afoot,
for there were great signs of movement on the German side, and all night, the
continual rattle of wheels was heard to the eastward. These menacing sounds
were actually caused by a very strong reinforcement, the Fifteenth German Corps
(Strasburg) of the regular army, which, followed by the Thirteenth Corps and
the Second Bavarian Corps, were coming into the battle line with the declared
intention of smashing their way through to Ypres. Correspondence, afterwards
captured, showed that the German Emperor had issued a special appeal to these
troops, declaring that the movement was one which would be of decisive
importance to the war. It was, of course, not the venerable town of Ypres which
had assumed such a place in the mind both of the Emperor and his people, but it
was Calais and the Channel coast to which it was the door. Once in the
possession of these points, it seemed to their perfervid minds that they would
be in a position to constrain Great Britain to an ignominious peace, a course
which would surely have ruined the cause of the Allies and placed the whole
world under the German heel. No less was the issue at stake. The British Army
from Langemarck in the north to La Bass&eacute;e in the south were resolutely
determined that the road was barred, while to left and to right they had
stout-hearted comrades of Belgium and of France.</p>
<p>At half-past six upon October 30 a very heavy attack developed, which
involved the whole line of the First Corps and also the French Ninth Corps upon
its left. This attack upon the left was carried out by the Reserve Corps 26 and
27, with whom we had had previous dealings, and it was repulsed with
considerable loss by the French and the 6th British Brigade. To the south,
however, the British were very violently engaged down the whole line of
trenches from the position of the Seventh Division near the Ypres-Menin road,
through Zandvoorde, where the Third Cavalry Division was holding on under great
difficulties, and on southward still, past the position of the Second Cavalry
down to Messines, where the First Cavalry Division was also heavily engaged.
The front of battle was not less than twelve miles in length, with one
continuous long-drawn rattle of small arms and roar of guns from end to
end.</p>
<p>The British may have anticipated that the chief blow would fall at the same
spot as had been attacked the day before. As a matter of fact, it was directed
farther south, at Zandvoorde, on the immediate right of the Seventh
Division.</p>
<p>The first sign of success for the strenuous German efforts upon October 30
was the driving in of Kavanagh's 7th Guards' Cavalry Brigade from their
trenches at the Zandvoorde Ridge. On this ridge. which is not more than a
hundred and twenty feet high, the Germans concentrated so tremendous and
accurate a fire that the trenches were in many places demolished and became
entirely untenable. The survivors of the Life Guards and Blues who made up this
brigade withdrew steadily through the reserve trenches, which were held by the
6th cavalry Brigade, and reformed at Klein Zillebeke in the rear. Two
squadrons, however, and Lord Worsley's machine-gun section were killed or taken
by the assailants. The unoccupied trenches were seized by the Sixth Bavarian
Reserve Division, who advanced rapidly in order to improve their advantage,
while their artillery began to pound the reserves. The cavalry had been
strengthened, however, by the Greys and 3rd Hussars upon the left, while the
4th Hussars lined up on the right, and C, I, and K Horse Artillery batteries
vigorously supported. In spite of great pressure, the position was held.
Farther south the First Cavalry Division was also at very close grips with the
Twenty-sixth Division of the Thirteenth German Army Corps, and was hard put to
it to hold its own. Along the whole cavalry position there was extreme strain.
A squadron of the 1st Royals were forced to evacuate the ch&acirc;teau of
Holebeke, and the line in this quarter was pushed back as far as St. Eloi, thus
flattening a considerable salient.</p>
<p>The danger of a position which consists of so long a line with few reserves
is that any retirement at any point immediately exposes the flanks of the
neighbouring units to right and left. Thus the evacuation of Zandvoorde threw
open the right flank of the Seventh Division, even as its left had been in the
air upon the day before. On getting through, the Germans were on the right rear
of the 1st Welsh Fusiliers and enfiladed them badly, destroying all the
officers and a first considerable proportion of the regiment, which had already
been greatly reduced. Colonel Cadogan was among those who fell. The 22nd
Brigade was forced to fall back, and the 2nd Yorkshires and 2nd Scots
Fusiliers, of the 21st Brigade, being left in a salient, suffered heavily,
especially the latter battalion, the conduct of which from first to last was
remarkable even among such men as fought beside them. These two regiments held
on with the greatest determination until orders to retire reached them, which
were somewhat belated, as several orderlies were killed in bringing them. The
2nd Bedfords, who had themselves sustained very severe losses from the German
artillery fire, covered the retirement of the remains of these two gallant
units. The Seventh Division then covered the line from the canal through Klein
Zillebeke and along the front of the woods to near Gheluvelt.</p>
<p>The position was now most critical. The Germans were in possession of
Zandvoorde Ridge on the British right flank, a most important position whence
guns could command a considerable area. Ypres was only four miles distant.
There was nothing but a line of weary and partially broken infantry to protect
the flank from being entirely pierced. The whole of a German active army corps
was attacking upon this line. The order was given to hold the new positions at
all costs, but on the evening of the 30th the situation was full of menace for
the morrow. The German flood was still thundering against the barrier, and the
barrier seemed to be giving. At about 2 P.M. on October 30 the 1st Irish Guards
and the 2nd Grenadiers, who were in reserve to two battalions of the Coldstream
in trenches in the Polygon Wood, near Reutel Village, were ordered to help the
Seventh Division. General Capper subsequently directed them to take the place
of the cavalry on the right of his division. The Irish Guards were accordingly
on the right of the Seventh Division from now onwards, and the Grenadiers were
on their right, extending down to the canal in front of Klein Zillebeke. The
commander of the Ninth French Corps also, with that fine loyalty which his
comrades have shown again and again during the war, easing many a difficult and
perhaps saving some impossible situations, put three battalions and some
cavalry at the disposal of the British. Two regiments of Bulfin's 2nd Brigade
were also brought across and thrust into the gap. But the outlook that evening
was not cheering. The troops had been fighting hard for two days without a
break. The losses had been heavy. The line had been driven back and was greatly
strained. It was known that the Germans were in great strength and that the
attack would be renewed on the morrow. The troops and their leaders faced the
immediate future in a spirit of sombre determination.</p>
<p>During the 30th Landon's Brigade had strengthened their position near
Gheluvelt, and General Haig, realising that this was the key of his line, moved
up the 2nd King's Royal Rifles and the 1st North Lancashires to form a reserve
under the orders of General Landon. These regiments took a position south-west
of Gheluvelt and connected up more closely between the Seventh Division and the
3rd Brigade of the First Division. It was well that a closely-knitted line had
been formed, for at the dawn of day upon the 31st a most terrific attack was
made, which was pushed with unexampled fierceness during the whole day, falling
chiefly upon the centre and left of the Seventh Division and upon the 1st
Queen's and 2nd Welsh of the Third Brigade.</p>
<p>A weak point developed, unfortunately, in the front line, for the Seventh
Division in its enfeebled condition was further weakened by forming somewhat of
a salient in the Kruiseik direction. They behaved with all their usual
magnificent gallantry, but they were not numerous enough to hold the ground.
The line was broken and the remains of the 2nd Royal Scots Fusiliers, after
being exposed to heavy fire from 5:30 A.M., were outflanked and surrounded in
the early afternoon. The bulk of the survivors of this battalion had been sent
to reinforce the line elsewhere, but the remainder, some sixty in number, were
killed, wounded, or taken, including their gallant colonel, Baird Smith, who
had been hit the day before. The Picton tradition which disregards wounds
unless they are absolutely crippling was continually observed by these stern
soldiers. On the left of the Scots Fusiliers the 2nd Bedfords were also
involved in the catastrophe, but drew off with heavy losses.</p>
<p>The left wing of the Seventh Division began to retire, and the 1st Queen's
upon the right of the 3rd Brigade had both their flanks turned and were reduced
to a handful under Major Watson and Lieutenant Boyd, who still held together as
a unit. It was a great morning in the history of this regiment, as the two
battalions had fought side by side, and their colonels. Pell and Coles, had
both fallen in the action.</p>

"Sketch of Battle of Gheluvelt, October 31"></a></div>
<p class="caption">Sketch of Battle of Gheluvelt, October 31</p>
<br>
<p>The line of the 3rd Brigade had been drawn up across the Menin road some
four hundred yards to the east of the village. The road itself was held by the
2nd Welsh Regiment, supported by the 54th Battery (Major Peel), which was
immediately behind the village. Both the battalion and the battery fought
desperately in a most exposed situation. The Welsh Regiment were driven out of
their trenches by a terrific shell-fire followed by an infantry attack. They
lost during the day nearly six hundred men, with sixteen officers, killed,
wounded, or missing. Colonel Morland was killed and Major Prichard badly
wounded. Finally, after being pushed back, holding every possible point, they
formed up under Captain Rees across the open in a thin skirmishing line to
cover the battery, which was doing great work by holding back the German
advance. One German gun was in action upon the Menin road. Lieutenant Blewitt
took a British gun out on to the bare road to face it, and a duel ensued at
five hundred yards, which ended by the German gun being knocked out at the
third shot by a direct hit.</p>
<p>When the First Division at the centre of the British line were driven in, as
already described, and the Seventh Division were pushed back into the woods,
the situation became most critical, for there was a general retirement, with a
victorious enemy pressing swiftly on upon the British centre. The men behaved
splendidly, and the officers kept their heads, taking every opportunity to form
up a new line. The 2nd Rifles and 1st North Lancashires in immediate support of
the centre did all that men could to hold it firm. The German artillery
lengthened their range as the British fell back, and the infantry, with their
murderous quick-firers scattered thickly in the front line, came rapidly on.
Communications were difficult, and everything for a time was chaos and
confusion. It looked for an hour or two as if Von Deimling, the German leader,
might really carry out his War Lord's command and break his road to the sea. It
was one of the decisive moments of the world's history, for if the Germans at
that period had seized the Channel ports, it is difficult to say how disastrous
the result might have been both to France and to the British Empire. At that
moment of darkness and doubt a fresh misfortune, which might well have proved
overwhelming, came upon the hard-pressed forces. About 1:30 a shell exploded in
the headquarters at the ch&acirc;teau of Hooge, and both General Lomax, of the
First Division, and General Munro, of the Second, were put out of action, the
first being wounded and the second rendered unconscious by the shock. It was a
brain injury to the Army, and a desperately serious one, for besides the two
divisional commanders the single shell had killed or wounded Colonels Kerr and
Perceval, Major Paley, Captains 0mmany and Trench, and Lieutenant Giffard.
General Landon, of the 3rd Brigade, took the command of the First Division at a
moment's notice, and the battle went forward. A line was hurriedly formed, men
digging as for their lives, whilst broken units threw themselves down to hold
off the rolling grey wave that thundered behind. The new position was
three-quarters of a mile back and about four hundred yards in advance of
Veldhoek, which is the next village down the Ypres road. The Seventh Division
had also been rolled back, but the fiery Capper, their divisional chief, who
has been described as a British Samurai, was everywhere among his regiments,
reforming and bracing them.</p>
<p>The British soldiers, with their incomparable regimental officers, rose to
the crisis, whilst General Haig was behind the line at Hooge, directing and
controlling, like a great engineer who seeks to hold a dam which carries an
overpowering head of water. By three o'clock the new line was firmly held.</p>
<p>Now General Haig, seeking round for some means of making a counter-attack,
perceived that on his left flank he had some reserve troops who had been
somewhat clear of the storm and might be employed. The 2nd Worcesters were
ordered to advance upon Gheluvelt, the initiative in this vital movement coming
from General FitzClarence of the 1st Brigade. On that flank the troops had not
joined in the retirement, and, including the South Wales Borderers of the 3rd
Brigade, were still in their original trenches, being just north of the swathe
that had been cut in the British line, and just south of where the Second
Division, extended to cracking point, with one man often for every eight or
nine feet, and no supports, were defending the left flank of the Army.</p>
<p>When the village of Gheluvelt and the trenches to the north of it had been
captured by the enemy, a gap had been left of about five hundred yards between
the northern edge of the village and these South Wales Borderers. This gap the
2nd Worcesters were ordered to fill. They were in reserve at the time in the
south-west corner of the Polygon Wood, but on being called upon they made a
brilliant advance under Major Hankey. One company (A) was detached to guard the
right flank of the advance. The other three companies came on for a thousand
yards. At one point they had to cross two hundred and twenty yards of open
under heavy shrapnel-fire. One hundred men fell, but the momentum of the charge
was never diminished. Their rapid and accurate fire drove back the German
infantry, while their open order formation diminished their own losses. Finally
they dashed into the trenches and connected up the village with the line of the
Welsh Borderers. Their right platoons, under Captain Williams, held the village
until nearly midnight. Altogether the advance cost the battalion 187
casualties, including 3 officers, out of 550 who were in the ranks that day. Up
to dusk the Worcesters were exposed to heavy shrapnel fire, and small detached
parties of the enemy came round their right flank, but their position was
strengthened and strongly held until the final readjustment of the line. It was
a fine advance at a critical moment, and did much to save the situation. The
whole movement was strongly supported by the guns of the 42nd Battery, and by
some of the 1st Scots Guards upon the left of the Welsh Borderers.</p>
<p>It has been stated that a line had been formed near Veldhoek, but this
difficult operation was not performed in an instant, and was rather the final
equilibrium established after a succession of oscillations. The British were
worn to a shadow. The 2nd Queen's had 2 officers and 60 men left that night,
the 2nd Welsh had 3 officers and 93 men. Little groups, who might have been
fitted into a large-sized drawing-room, were settling a contention upon which
the fate of the world might depend. But the Germans also had spent all their
force. The rattle of musketry behind their advance was enough to tell them that
the British were still in their trenches, and the guns were for ever playing on
them with deadly effect. Gradually they began to dissolve away among the thick
woods which flank the road. They were learning that to penetrate the line of a
resolute adversary is not necessarily the prelude to victory. It may mean that
the farther you advance the more your flanks are exposed. So it was now, when
the infantry to the north on one side and the Third Cavalry Division on the
other were closing in on them. That long tentacle which was pushing its way
towards Ypres had to be swiftly withdrawn once more, and withdrawn under a
heavy fire from the 29th, 41st, and 45th field batteries.</p>
<p>The Scattered German infantry who had taken refuge in the woods of Hooge,
which lie to the south of the road, were followed up by mounted and dismounted
men of the Royals, 10th Hussars, and 3rd Dragoon Guards, aided by some French
cavalry. These troops advanced through the woods, killing or taking a number of
the enemy. By nightfall the Germans had fallen back along the whole debated
line; the various British units, though much disorganised, were in close touch
with each other, and the original trenches had in the main been occupied, the
Berkshire Regiment helping to close the gap in the centre. The flood had slowly
ebbed away, and the shaken barrier was steady once more, thanks to the
master-hands which had so skilfully held it firm. The village of Gheluvelt
remained in the hands of the Germans, but the British trenches were formed to
the west of it, and the road to the sea was barred as effectually as ever.
These are the main, facts of the action of Gheluvelt, which may well be given a
name of its own, though it was only one supremely important episode in that
huge contention which will be known as the First Battle of Ypres.</p>
<p>In the southern portion of the Ypres area at Klein Zillebeke a very sharp
engagement was going on, which swung and swayed with as much violence and
change as the main battle on the Menin road. The German attack here was hardly
inferior in intensity to that in the north. Having pushed back Lawford's weak
brigade (22nd) it struck full upon part of Bulfin's 2nd Brigade, which had been
detached from the First Division and sent to cover the right of the Seventh
Division. Its own flank was now exposed, and its situation for a time was
critical. The German advance was sudden and impetuous, coming through a wood
which brought the dense mass of the enemy's leading formation almost unseen
right up to the British line. The position of the 2nd Brigade was pierced, and
the two regiments present, the 2nd Sussex and the 1st Northamptons, were driven
back with loss. Their brigadier rallied them some hundreds of yards to the
rear, where they formed up into a skirmish line in the open, and, though unable
to advance, kept back the Germans with their rifle-fire. The losses still
continued, however, and the enemy came on again and again with numbers which
seemed inexhaustible. Suddenly there was a charging yell from behind a low
slope covering the rear, and over the brow there appeared some three hundred
survivors of the 2nd Gordons, rushing at full speed with fixed bayonets. At the
same moment the dismounted troopers of the 6th Cavalry Brigade and a company of
sappers ran forward to join in the charge. The whole British force was not one
to three of its opponents, but as the reinforcing line swept on, cheering with
all its might, the survivors of the hard-pressed brigade sprang up with a shout
and the united wave burst over the Germans. Next moment they had broken and
were flying for their lives through the Zwartelen Wood. The pursuit lasted for
some distance, and a great number of the enemy were bayoneted, while several
hundreds were taken prisoners.</p>
<p>There have been few more critical occasions in British operations than this
action upon October 31, when the Germans so nearly forced their way to Ypres.
It is the peculiarity of modern warfare that, although vast armies are locked
in a close struggle, the number of men who can come into actual contact at any
one point is usually far more limited than in the old days, when each host
could view the other from wing to wing. Thus the losses in such an action are
small as compared with the terrific death-roll of a Napoleonic battle. On the
other hand, when the operations are viewed broadly and one groups a series of
actions into one prolonged battle, like the Aisne or Ypres, then the resulting
losses become enormous. The old battle was a local conflagration, short and
violent. The new one is a widespread smoulder, breaking here and there into
flame. In this affair of Gheluvelt the casualties of the British did not exceed
2000 or 3000, while those of the Germans, who were more numerous and who
incurred the extra loss which falls upon the attack, could not have been less
than twice that figure. One thousand five hundred dead were actually picked up
and six hundred prisoners were taken. Some hundreds of prisoners were also
taken by the enemy. The British artillery, which worked desperately hard all
day, had many losses both upon the 30th and the 31st. The 12th Battery had all
its guns silenced but one, and many others were equally hard hit.</p>
<p>On the night of the 31st considerable French reinforcements began to arrive,
and it was high time that they did so, for the First Corps, including the
Seventh Division, were likely to bleed to death upon the ground that they were
holding. It had stood the successive attacks of four German corps, and it had
held its line against each of them. But its own ranks had been grievously
thinned and the men were weary to death. The strain, it should be added, was
equally great upon the Ninth French Corps to the north, which had its own set
of assailants to contend with. Now that the line of the Yser, so splendidly
guarded by the Belgians, had proved to be impregnable, and that the French from
Dixmude in the north had repulsed all attacks, the whole German advance upon
Calais, for which Berlin was screaming, was centred upon the Ypres lines. It
was time, then, that some relief should come to the hard-pressed troops. For
several days the French on the right and the left took the weight of the attack
upon themselves, and although the front was never free from fighting, there was
a short period of comparative rest for Haig's tired men. In successive days
they had lost Kruiseik, Zandvoorde, and Gheluvelt, but so long as they held the
semicircle of higher ground which covers Ypres these small German gains availed
them nothing.</p>
<p>Looking back at the three actions of the 29th, a great 30th, and especially
of the 31st of October, one can clearly perceive that it was the closest thing
to a really serious defeat which the Army had had since Le Cateau. If the
Germans had been able to push home their attack once again, it is probable that
they would have taken Ypres, and that the results would have been most serious.
Sir John French is reported as having said that there was no time in the Mons
retreat when he did not see his way, great as were his difficulties, but that
there was a moment upon October 31 when he seemed to be at the end of his
resources. To Sir John at Ypres converged all the cries for succour, and from
him radiated the words of hope and encouragement which stiffened the breaking
lines. To him and to his untiring lieutenant, Douglas Haig, the Empire owed
more that day than has ever been generally realised. The latter was up to the
firing line again and again rallying the troops. The sudden removal of the two
divisional commanders of the First Corps was a dreadful blow at such a moment,
and the manner in which General Landon, of the 3rd Brigade, took over the
command of the First Division at a moment's notice was a most noteworthy
performance. The fact that three divisions of infantry with brigades which
resembled battalions, and battalions which were anything from companies to
platoons, destitute of reserves save for a few dismounted cavalry, barred the
path to a powerful German army, is one of the greatest feats of military
history. It was a very near thing. There was a time, it is said, when the
breech-blocks had actually been taken from the heavy guns in order to disable
them, and some of the artillery had been passed back through Ypres. But the
line held against all odds, as it has done so often in the past. The struggle
was not over. For a fortnight still to come it was close and desperate. But
never again would it be quite so perilous as on that immortal last day of
October, when over the green Flemish meadows, beside the sluggish
water-courses, on the fringes of the old-world villages, and in the heart of
the autumn-tinted woods, two great Empires fought for the mastery.</p>
<p>Such was the British epic. There was another to the north which was no less
wonderful, and which will be celebrated by the poets and historians of the
lands to which the victors belong. It will tell of the glorious stand during
this critical ten days of the Belgians, so weary, so battered, and yet so
indomitable. It will tell how they made head against the hosts of the Duke of
W&uuml;rtemberg, and how in the end they flooded their own best land with the
salt water which would sterilise it in order to cover their front. It will tell
also of the splendid Frenchmen who fought at Dixmude, of Ronarch with his
invincible marines, and of Grossetti, the fat and debonair, seated in an
armchair in the village street and pointing the road to victory with his cane.
Not least, perhaps, in that epic will be the tale of the British monitors who,
with the deadly submarines upon one side of them and the heavy German batteries
upon the other, ran into the Flemish coast and poured their fire upon the right
flank of the attacking Germans. Ten days the great battle swung and swayed, and
then here as at Ypres the wave of the invaders ebbed, or reached its definite
flood. It would be an ungenerous foe who would not admit that they had fought
bravely and well. Not all our hatred of their national ideals nor our contempt
for their crafty misleaders can prevent us from saluting those German officers
and soldiers who poured out their blood like water in the attempt to do that
which was impossible.</p>

BATTLE OF YPRES (continued)<br>
(From the Action of Gheluvelt to the Winter Lull)</a></h2>

Division&mdash;Situation at Ypres&mdash;Attack of the Prussian Guard

<p class="first">WHILST this severe fighting had been going on to the north of
the British position, the centre, where the first dismounted cavalry were
holding the line of trenches, was so terribly pressed that it is an
extraordinary thing that they were able to hold their own. The Second Corps,
which at that time had just been withdrawn for a rest from the La Bass&eacute;e
lines, were the only available reinforcements. When news was flashed south as
to the serious state of affairs, two regiments, the 2nd Yorkshire Light
Infantry and the 2nd Scottish Borderers from the 13th Infantry Brigade, were
sent up in motor-buses by road to the relief. Strange indeed was the sight of
these vehicles flying along the Flemish roads, plastered outside with the
homely names of London suburbs and crammed with the grimy, much-enduring
infantry. The lines at Messines were in trouble, and so also were those at
Wytschaete farther to the north. To this latter place went two battalions of
Shaw's 9th Brigade, the 1st Northumberland Fusiliers and the 1st Lincolns. Hard
work awaited the infantry at Messines and at Wytschaete, for in both places
Allenby's troopers were nearly rushed off their feet.</p>
<p>It has already been shown that on October 30 a severe assault was made upon
the Third Cavalry Division, when the 7th Brigade (Kavanagh's) was forced out of
Zandvoorde by the Fifteenth German Army Corps. Upon this same date a most
strenuous attack, made in great force and supported by a terrific shell-fire,
was directed along the whole line of the cavalry from Wytschaete to Messines.
No British troops have been exposed to a more severe ordeal than these brave
troopers, for they were enormously outnumbered at every point, and their line
was so thin that it was absolutely impossible for them to prevent it from being
pierced by the masses of infantry, from the Twenty-fourth Corps and Second
Bavarian Corps, which were hurled against them. From the extreme left of the
Second Cavalry Division near Wytschaete to the right of the First Cavalry
Division south of Messines the same reports came in to the anxious General, of
trenches overwhelmed or enfiladed, and of little isolated groups of men
struggling most desperately to keep a footing against an ever-surging grey tide
which was beating up against them and flowing through every gap. In the north
Gough's men were nearly overwhelmed, the 5th Irish Lancers were shelled out of
a farmhouse position, and the 16th Lancers, shelled from in front and decimated
by rifles and machine-guns from the flank, were driven back for half a mile
until three French battalions helped the line to reform. The pressure, however,
was still extreme, the Germans fighting with admirable energy and coming
forward in never-ending numbers.</p>
<p>An Indian regiment of the 7th (Ferozepore) Brigade, Ypres. the 129th
Baluchis, had been helping the cavalry in this region since October 23, but
their ranks were now much decimated, and they were fought almost to a
standstill. Two more British regiments from the Second Corps, the 1st Lincolns
and the 1st Northumberland Fusiliers of the 9th Brigade, together with their
Brigadier, Shaw, who was a reinforcement in himself, were, as already stated,
hurried off from the south in motor-buses to strengthen Gough's line. Advancing
into what was to them an entirely strange position these two veteran regiments
sustained very heavy losses, which they bore with extreme fortitude. They were
surprised by the Germans on the road between Kern in el and Wytschaete on the
night of October 31, the same night upon which the London Scottish to the south
of them were so heavily engaged. Colonel Smith succeeded in extricating the
Lincolns from what was a most perilous position, but only after a loss of 16
officers and 400 men. The Fusiliers were almost as hard hit. For forty-eight
hours the battle swung backwards and forwards in front of Wytschaete, and in
the end the village itself was lost, but the defensive lines to the west of it
were firmly established. By November the second strong French reinforcements
had appeared, and it was clear that this desperate attempt to break through the
very centre of the British position had definitely failed.</p>
<p>The struggle at Messines, some five miles to the south, had been even more
severe and sanguinary than at Wytschaete. In the early morning of the 31st the
Bays and the 5th Dragoon Guards upon the left of the Messines position, after a
heavy shell-fire, were driven out of their trenches by a sudden furious advance
of the German infantry. The front of the village of Messines was held by Wild's
57th Rifles, who were driven in by the same attack, every officer engaged being
killed or wounded. A reserve company of Wild's Rifles and a squadron of the 5th
Dragoon Guards endeavoured to restore the fight, but could not hold the
torrent. The 9th Lancers, also in front of the village and to the right of the
Indians, held on for a long time, repulsing the infantry attacks, until they
were driven back by the deadly shell-fire. At one time they were enfiladed on
both sides and heard the Germans roaring their war-songs in the dark all round
them; but they were able, owing to the coolness of Colonel Campbell and the
discipline of his veteran troopers, to fall back and to reform upon the western
side of the village. Lance-Corporal Seaton distinguished himself by covering
the retreat of his whole squadron, remaining single-handed in his trench until
his maxim was destroyed, after he had poured a thousand shots into the close
ranks of his assailants.</p>
<p>The situation was so serious after dawn upon the 31st that General De Lisle
had to call for help from Wilson's Fourth Infantry Division, holding the line
upon his right. The Inniskilling Fusiliers were extended so as to relieve his
right flank. The struggle within Messines was still going forward with fighting
from house to house, but the Germans, who were coming on with overpowering
numbers and great valour, were gradually winning their way forward. The
Oxfordshire Hussars, fresh from the base, were thrown into the combat. A second
line of defence had been arranged a mile or so to the west, near Wulverghem,
but if Messines must go the victors should at least pay the price down to the
last drop of blood which could be wrung from them. Reinforcements were within
sight, both French and British, but they were scanty in quantity though superb
in quality. It was a most critical position, and one cannot but marvel at the
load of responsibility which Sir John French had to bear upon this day, for
from the left of Haig's First Corps in the north down to Neuve Chapelle in the
south, a stretch of twenty-five miles, there was hardly a point which was not
strained to the verge of cracking. Cool and alert, he controlled the situation
from his central post and threw in such reinforcements as he could find,
though, indeed, they could only be got by taking them from places where they
were wanted and hurrying them to places where they were needed even more
urgently. He was strengthened always by the knowledge that General Joffre
behind him was doing all that a loyal colleague could to find fresh columns of
his splendid infantrymen to buttress up the hard-pressed line.</p>
<p>For the moment, however, none of these were available, and Messines was
still partly in British, partly in German hands. Briggs's 1st Brigade &mdash;
Bays, 5th Dragoon Guards, and 11th Hussars&mdash;with the Oxfords, held on to
the western edge of the town. To their left, linking up with Gough's men in the
Wytschaete sector, was the 4th Dragoon Guards. Late in the afternoon the 2nd
Scots Borderers and the 2nd Yorkshire Light Infantry, the joint detachment
under Major Coke, arrived from the south, and were at once advanced upon
Messines to stiffen the defence. Under heavy fire they established themselves
in the village. Evening fell with desperate street fighting and the relative
position unchanged. Twice the Bavarians stormed into the central square, and
twice they fell back after littering it with their bodies. It seemed hopeless
to hold the village against the ever-growing pressure of the Germans, and yet
the loss of the village entailed the loss of the ridge, which would leave a
commanding position in the hands of the enemy. Village and ridge were mutually
dependent, for if either were lost the other could not be held.</p>
<p>As it proved, it was the ridge and not the village which could no longer
sustain the pressure. On the night of October 31 Mullen's 2nd Cavalry Brigade
&mdash;9th Lancers, 4th Dragoon Guards, and 11th Hussars&mdash;took over the
defence from Briggs. Of these, the 4th Dragoon Guards were to the left of the
village upon the ridge. The London Scottish had been brought up, and they were
placed upon the left of the 4th Dragoon Guards, forming a link of the defence
which connected up the Second Cavalry Division with the First. The right-hand
regiment of the latter, the 6th Carbineers, of Bingham's 4th Brigade, were upon
the left of the London Scottish. These two regiments held the centre of the
ridge. The London Scottish had already suffered considerable losses. Hurried up
from the lines of communication to St. Eloi, they were pushed forward at once
into action, and were exposed for hours to all the nerve-racking horrors of a
heavy shell-fire endured in most insufficient trenches. A more severe ordeal
was in store for them, however, during the grim night which lay before them.
The admirable behaviour of Colonel Malcolm's men excited the more attention as
they were the first Territorial infantry to come into action, and they set a
standard which has been grandly sustained by the quarter-million of their
comrades who have from first to last come into the line.</p>
<p>On the early morning of November 1 there had been a strong attempt within
the village to improve the British position, and some ground was actually
gained by the cavalrymen, the Yorkshire Light Infantry, and the Scots
Borderers. What occurred, however, on the ridge to the north made all further
effort a useless waste of life. The Bavarian infantry had come with an
irresistible rush against the thin British line. The order to hold their ground
at all costs was given, and the London Scots answered it in a way which gained
the highest praise from the many soldiers who saw it. It is not claimed that
they did better than their Regular comrades. That would be impossible. The most
that can be said is that they proved themselves worthy to fight in line with
them. After being exposed for several hours to heavy shell-fire, it was no
light task for any troops to be called upon to resist a direct assault. From
nine in the evening of October 31 to two in the morning, under the red glare of
burning houses. Colonel Malcolm's Scottish and Colonel Annesley's Carbineers
held back the Bavarian advance, an advance which would have meant the piercing
of the British line. At two o'clock the Bavarians in greatly predominant force
were all round the Scots, and even the reserve companies found work for their
bayonets, preventing the enemy from encircling their companions. The losses
were very heavy&mdash;400 men and 9 officers, including their gallant doctor,
McNab, who was villainously stabbed as he bandaged a patient. In spite of the
great pressure, the ground was held all night, and it was not till dawn, when
the regiment found that it was outflanked on both sides and nearly surrounded,
that, under cover of the fire of E Battery R.H.A., it fell back. The Carbineers
and the Scots were close together, and the Germans, with their usual quick
ingenuity, approached the former with a cry of "We are the London Scots." A
disaster might have occurred in the darkness but for the quickness and bravery
of a young officer, Lieutenant Hope Hawkins, who rushed forward, discovered the
identity of the Germans, and fell, riddled with bullets, even while he gave
warning to his comrades.</p>
<p>The Germans had won the ridge, but the British line was still intact and
growing stronger every hour. The village was held by the Scots Borderers and
Yorkshiremen until nearly ten o'clock, when they were ordered to fall back and
help to man the new line. The shock had been a rude one, but the danger-hour
was past here as in the north.</p>
<p>The fateful November 1 had come and gone. The villages of Messines and
Wytschaete were, it is true, in German hands, but French reinforcements of the
Sixteenth Corps were streaming up from the south, the line, though torn and
broken, still held firm, and the road to Calais was for ever blocked. There was
still pressure, and on November 2 the 11th Hussars were badly cut up by
shell-fire, but the line was impregnable. Sir John French summed up in a few
terse words the true meaning of the operations just described, when he said
afterwards, in addressing the 9th Lancers, "Particularly I would refer to the
period, October 31, when for forty-eight hours the Cavalry Corps held at bay
two German army corps. During this period you were supported by only three or
four battalions, shattered and worn by previous fighting, and in so doing you
rendered inestimable service." There have been few episodes in the war which
have been at the same time so splendid and so absolutely vital. The First
Cavalry Division lost 50 per cent of its numbers between October 30 and
November 2, and the Second Division was hardly in better case, but never did
men give their lives to better purpose. Their heroism saved the Army.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the current of operations was evidently running strongly towards
the northern end of the British line, where help was badly needed, as Haig's
men had been fought almost to exhaustion. There was no British reinforcement
available save only the weary Second Corps, the remains of which from this date
began to be drafted northwards. It was already known that the German Emperor
had appeared in person in that region, and that a great concentration of his
troops was taking place. At the same time the French were making splendid
exertions in order to stiffen their own line and help us in those parts, like
Messines, Wytschaete, and Ploegsteert, where the attack was most formidable. It
was a great gathering towards the north, and clearly some hard blows were to be
struck. Northwards then went General Morland, of the Fifth Division, taking
with him four more weak battalions. The whole line had moved upwards towards
the danger spot, and these troops now found themselves east of Bailleul, close
to the village of Neuve &Eacute;glise. For the moment General Smith-Dorrien was
without an army, for half his men were now supporting General Willcocks in the
south and half General Allenby or General Haig in the north.</p>
<p>The British leaders all along the line were, as usual, desperately
endeavouring to make one man do the work of three, but they were buoyed up by
the knowledge that good Father Joffre, like some beneficent earthly Providence,
was watching over them from the distance, and that fresh trainfuls of his brave
little men were ever steaming into the danger zone. Day by day the line was
thickening and the task of the Kaiser becoming more difficult. It was hoped
that the crisis was past. If our troops were exhausted so also, it was thought,
were those of the enemy. We could feel elated by the knowledge that we had held
our ground, while they could hardly fail to be depressed by the reflection that
they had made little progress in spite of so many heroic efforts, and that
Calais was as far from them as ever.</p>
<p>The narrative must now return to the defenders of the Ypres approaches, who
were left in a state of extreme exhaustion by the critical action of October
31. On November 1 the First Corps was not in a condition to do more than to
hold its line. This line was now near to Veldhoek, to the west of Gheluvelt
village, and to that extent the Germans had profited by their desperate
fighting, but this was a detail of small consequence so long as an unbroken
British Army covered the town that was still the objective of the enemy. The
Ninth French Corps to the north of the British had lost heavily, but to the
south of the canal lay the Sixteenth French Corps, which was in comparatively
good condition. This corps now made an advance to take some of the pressure off
the British line, while Moussy's regiments to the north of the canal were to
co-operate with Bulfin's men upon their left. Upon the left of Bulfin's 2nd
Brigade were two battalions of the 4th Brigade of Guards.</p>
<p>One of these battalions had a terrible experience upon this morning. For
some reason the trenches of the Irish Guards were exposed to an enfilading fire
from the high explosives of the Germans, which wrought even more than their
customary damage. For hours the Guardsmen lay under a terrific fire, to which
they could make no reply, and from which they could obtain no protection. When
at last, in the afternoon, they were compelled to fall back, their losses had
been great, including their colonel, Lord Ardee, 7 other officers, and over 300
men. It is the hard fate of the side which is weaker in artillery to endure
such buffetings with no possibility of return.</p>
<p>The French attack of the Sixteenth Corps had been brought to a speedy
standstill, and a severe counter-attack, preceded by a heavy shell-fire, had
fallen upon General Moussy's men and upon the half of the 2nd Brigade. Help was
urgently needed, so the remains of the 7th Brigade from the Third Cavalry
Division were hurried forward. The Germans were now surging up against the
whole right and right-centre of the line. It seems to have been their system to
attack upon alternate days on the right and on the centre, for it will be
remembered that it was on October 29 that they gained the Gheluvelt
cross-roads, and on October 31 Gheluvelt village, both in the centre, while on
October 30 they captured the Zandvoorde ridge upon the British right, and now,
on November 1, were pressing hard upon the right once more.</p>
<p>That morning the Army sustained a loss in the person of General Bulfin, who
was wounded in the head by shrapnel. Fortunately his recovery was not a lengthy
one, and he was able to return in January as commander of the Twenty-eighth
Division. Upon his fall, Lord Cavan, of the 4th Brigade, took over the command
upon the hard-pressed right wing. At half-past one the hundred survivors of the
2nd Gordons, on the right of the Seventh Division, and the 2nd Oxford and
Bucks, were desperately hard pressed by a strong German infantry advance, and
so were the remains of the Sussex and Northamptons. The only available help lay
in the 23rd Field Company of Royal Engineers. Our sappers proved, as they have
so often done before, that their hearts are as sound as their heads. They
pushed off the enemy, but incurred heavy losses. The situation was still
critical when at the summons of Lord Cavan the 2nd Grenadiers advanced and
cleared the Germans from the woods in the front and flank, while the 10th
Hussars supported their advance. A gap had been left in the trenches from which
the Irish Guards had been pushed, but this was now filled up by cavalry, who
connected up with the French on their right and with the Guards upon their
left. The general effect of the whole day's fighting was to drive the British
line farther westward, but to contract it, so that it required a smaller force.
Two battalions&mdash;the Gordons and the Sussex&mdash;could be taken out and
brought into reserve. The centre of the line had a day's rest and dug itself
into its new positions, but the units were greatly mixed and confused.</p>
<p>November 2 brought no surcease from the constant fighting, though the
disturbance of these days, severe as it was, may be looked upon as a mere
ground swell after the terrific storm of the last days of October.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 2nd the Ninth French Corps upon the British left,
under General Vidal, sent eight battalions forward to the south and east in the
direction of Gheluvelt. Part of this village was actually occupied by them. The
Germans meanwhile, with their usual courage and energy, were driving a fresh
attack down that Menin road which had so often been reddened by their blood. It
was the day for a centre attack on their stereotyped system of alternate
pushes, and it came duly to hand. An initial success awaited them as, getting
round a trench occupied by the Rifles, they succeeded in cutting off a number
of them. The 3rd Brigade was hurried up by General Landon to the point of
danger, and a French Zouave regiment helped to restore the situation. A
spirited bayonet charge, in which the Gloucesters led, was beaten back by the
enemy's fire. After a day of confused and desultory fighting the situation in
the evening was very much as it had been in the morning. Both that night and
the next day there was a series of local and sporadic attacks, first on the
front of the Second Division and then of the Seventh, all of which were driven
back. The Germans began to show their despair of ever gaining possession of
Ypres by elevating their guns and dropping shells upon the old Cloth Hall of
that historic city, a senseless act of spiteful vandalism which exactly
corresponds with their action when the Allied Army held them in front of
Rheims.</p>
<p>November 4 was a day of menaces rather than of attacks. On this day, units
which had become greatly mixed during the incessant and confused fighting of
the last fortnight were rearranged and counted. The losses were terrible. The
actual strength of the infantry of the First Division upon that date was: 1st
Brigade, 22 officers, 1206 men; 2nd Brigade, 43 officers, 1315 men; 3rd
Brigade, 27 officers, 970 men; which make the losses of the whole division
about 75 per cent. Those of the Second Division were very little lighter. And
now for the 25 per cent remainder of this gallant corps there was not a moment
of breathing space or rest, but yet another fortnight of unremitting work,
during which their thin ranks were destined to hold the German army, and even
the Emperor's own Guard, from passing the few short miles which separated them
from their objective. Great was the "will to conquer" of the Kaiser's troops,
but greater still the iron resolve not to be conquered which hardened the
war-worn lines of the soldiers of the King.</p>
<p>November 5 was a day of incessant shell-fire, from which the Seventh
Division, the 4th and the 6th Brigades were the chief sufferers. On this day
the Seventh Division, which had now been reduced from 12,000 infantry to 2333,
was withdrawn from the line. In their place were substituted those
reinforcements from the south which have already been mentioned. These
consisted of eleven battalions of the Second Corps under General McCracken;
this corps, however, was greatly worn, and the eleven battalions only
represented 3500 rifles. The Seventh Division was withdrawn to Bailleul in the
south, but Lawford's 22nd Brigade was retained in corps reserve, and was
destined to have one more trial before it could be spared for rest. The day was
memorable also for a vigorous advance of the Gloucester Regiment, which was
pushed with such hardihood that they sustained losses of nearly half their
numbers before admitting that they could not gain their objective.</p>
<p>A description has been given here of the events of the north of the line and
of the cavalry positions, but it is not to be supposed that peace reigned on
the south of this point. On the contrary, during the whole period under
discussion, while the great fight raged at Ypres, there had been constant
shelling and occasional advances against the Third Corps in the
Armenti&egrave;res section, and also against the Indians and the Second Corps
down to the La Bass&eacute;e Canal.</p>
<p>The most serious of these occurred upon November 9. Upon this date the
Germans, who had knocked so loudly at Messines and at Wytschaete without
finding that any opening through our lines was open to them, thought that they
might find better luck at Ploegsteert, which is a village on the same line as
the other two. Wytschaete is to the north, Messines in the middle, and
Ploegsteert in the south, each on the main road from Ypres to
Armenti&egrave;res, with about four miles interval between each. The German
attack was a very strong one, but the hundredfold drama was played once more.
On the 3rd Worcesters fell the brunt, and no more solid fighters have been
found in the Army than those Midland men from the very heart of England. A
temporary set-back was retrieved and the line restored. Major Milward, of the
Worcesters, a very gallant officer, was grievously wounded in this affair. The
counter-attack which restored the situation was carried out mainly by the 1st
East Lancashires, who lost Major Lambert and a number of men in the
venture.</p>
<p>Upon November 6, about 2 P.M., a strong German advance drove in those French
troops who were on the right of Lord Cavan's Brigade&mdash;4th &mdash;which
occupied the extreme right of Haig's position. The point was between Klein
Zillebeke and the canal, where a German lodgment would have been most serious.
The retirement of the French exposed the right flank of the 1st Irish Guards.
This flank was strongly attacked, and for the second time in a week this brave
regiment endured very heavy losses. No. 2 company was driven back to the
support trenches, and No. 1 company, being isolated, was destroyed. Their
neighbours on the left, the 2nd Grenadiers stood fast, but a great and
dangerous alley-way was left for the Germans round the British right wing. The
situation was splendidly saved by Kavanagh's 7th Cavalry Brigade, who galloped
furiously down the road to the place where they were so badly needed. This
hard-worked <i>corps d'&eacute;lite</i>, consisting of the 1st and 2nd Life
Guards supported by the Blues, now dismounted and flung themselves into the
gap, a grimy line of weather-stained infantry with nothing left save their
giant physique and their spurs to recall the men who are the pride of our
London streets. The retiring French rallied at the sight of the sons of Anak.
An instant later the Germans were into them, and there was a terrific
<i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> of British, French, and Prussians, which swung and
swayed over the marshland and across the road. Men drove their bayonets through
each other or fired point-blank into each other's bodies in a most desperate
fight, the Germans slowly but surely recoiling, until at last they broke. It
was this prompt and vigorous stroke by Kavanagh's Brigade which saved a
delicate situation. Of the three cavalry regiments engaged, two lost their
colonels&mdash;Wilson of the Blues and Dawnay of the 2nd Life Guards. Sixteen
officers fell in half an hour. The losses in rank and file were also heavy, but
the results were great and indeed vital. The whole performance was an
extraordinarily fine one.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of November 7 Lawford's 22nd Brigade, which was now
reduced to 1100 men, with 7 officers, was called upon to retake a line of
trenches which the enemy had wrested from a neighbouring unit. Unbroken in
nerve or spirit by their own terrific losses, they rushed forward, led by
Lawford himself, a cudgel in his hand, carried the trench, captured three
machine-guns, held the trench till evening, and then retired for a time from
the line. Captains Vallentin and Alleyne, who led the two regiments into which
the skeleton brigade had been divided, both fell in this feat of arms. After
this action there remained standing the brigadier, 3 officers, and 700 men. The
losses of the brigade work out at 97 per cent of the officers and 80 per cent
of the men, figures which can seldom have been matched in the warfare of any
age, and yet were little in excess of the other brigades, as is shown by the
fact that the whole division on November 7 numbered 44 officers and 2336 men.
It is true that many British regiments found themselves in this campaign with
not one single officer or man left who had started from England, but these were
usually the effects of months of campaigning. In the case of the Seventh
Division, all these deadly losses had been sustained in less than three weeks.
Britain's soldiers have indeed been faithful to the death. Their record is the
last word in endurance and military virtue.</p>
<p>The division was now finally withdrawn from the fighting line. It has
already been stated that there were reasons which made its units exceptionally
fine ones. In General Capper they possessed a leader of enormous energy and
fire, whilst his three brigadiers&mdash;Watts, Lawford, and
Ruggles-Brise&mdash;could not be surpassed by any in the Army. Yet with every
advantage of officers and men there will always be wonder as well as admiration
for what they accomplished. For three days, before the First Corps had come
thoroughly into line, they held up the whole German advance, leaving the
impression upon the enemy that they were faced by two army corps. Then for
twelve more days they held the ground in the very storm-centre of the attack
upon Ypres. When at last the survivors staggered from the line, they had made a
name which will never die.</p>
<p>The bulk of Smith-Dorrien's Corps had now been brought north, so that from
this date (November 7) onwards the story of the First and Second Corps is
intimately connected. When we last saw this corps it will be remembered that it
had been withdrawn from the front, having lost some twelve thousand men in
three weeks of La Bass&eacute;e operations, and that the Indian Corps had taken
over their line of trenches. Such fighting men could not, however, be spared in
the midst of such a fight. The hospital was the only rest that any British
soldier could be afforded. Whilst they had still strength to stand they must
line up to the German flood or be content to see it thunder past them to the
coast. They were brought north, save only Bowes' 8th Brigade and Maude's l4th,
which remained with the Indians in the south. Although the Seventh Division had
been drawn out of the line, its attendant cavalry division still remained to
give its very efficient help to General Haig.</p>
<p>The British position, though by no means secure, was getting stronger day by
day, for General d'Urbal of the Eighth French Army to the north, and General
Maud'huy to the south, had both been strongly reinforced, and with their usual
good comradeship did all they could to strengthen the flanks and shorten the
front of the British line.</p>
<p>The men of the Second Corps who had come north from the La Bass&eacute;e
district were not left long unmolested in their new sphere of operations. On
the afternoon of November 7 there was a hot German attack upon that portion of
the line which had just been vacated by the Seventh Division. The trenches were
now held by the Fifth Division (Morland's).</p>
<p>The enemy may have hoped for some advantage from a change which they may
well have observed, but they found that, though the units might be different,
the same old breed still barred their path. On this occasion, after the early
rush had spent itself upon the 1st Lincolns, it was the 2nd West Ridings who
led the counter-charge. The line, however, was never fully re-established. A
number of smaller attacks broke upon the front of the Second Division on the
same day, leaving a few score of prisoners behind them as they ebbed. On the
same day, November 7, the enemy got into the trenches of the 2nd Highland Light
Infantry and remained in them, for all of them were bayoneted or taken. Upon
this day the London Scottish were brought up into the Ypres line &mdash; a
sign, if one were needed, that after the action described they were accepted as
the peers of their comrades of the Regular Army, for no empty compliments are
passed when the breaking of a unit may mean the enfilading of a line.</p>
<p>November 8 was a quiet day, but it was well known from every report of spy,
scout, and aeroplane to be the lull before the storm. One German brigade came
down the Menin road, and went up it again, leaving a hundred dead on or beside
the causeway. This attack inflicted some loss upon the 1st North Lancashires
and on the 1st Scots Guards. The 1st Bedfords captured a trench that night. The
9th and the 10th were uneventful, and the tired troops rested on their arms,
though never free for an hour from the endless pelting of shells. To the north
and east the Eagles were known to be gathering. There were the Emperor, the
Emperor's Guard, and a great fresh battle of the Germans ready for one grand
final dash for Calais, with every rifle in the firing line and every cannon to
support it. Grave messages came from headquarters, warning words were passed to
anxious brigadiers, who took counsel with their colonels as to fire-fields and
supports. Batteries were redistributed, depleted limbers refilled, and
observation posts pushed to the front, while the untiring sappers gave the last
touches to traverse and to trench. All was ready for the fray. So close were
the lines that at many points the conversations of the enemy could be
heard.</p>
<p>The Germans had already concentrated a large number of troops against this
part of the British line, and they were now secretly reinforced by a division
of the Prussian Guard. Documents found afterwards upon the dead show that the
Guard had had special orders from the Emperor to break the line at all costs.
The brigades which attacked were made up of the 1st and 2nd Foot Guards, the
Kaiser Franz Grenadiers No. 2, the K&ouml;nigin Augusta Grenadiers No. 4, and
the battalion of Garde J&auml;ger&mdash;13,000 men in all. It was to be victory
or death with the <i>corps d'&eacute;lite</i> of the German army, but it was no
less victory or death with the men who opposed them. After an artillery
preparation of appalling intensity for three hours along the line of both the
First and Second Divisions, the infantry advance began about 9:30 on the
morning of November 11 amid a storm of wind and rain. They are gregarious
fighters, the Germans, finding comfort and strength in the rush of serried
ranks. Even now the advance was made in a close formation, but it was carried
out with magnificent dash, amazing valour, and a pedantic precision which
caused, for example, the leading officers to hold their swords at the carry.
The Prussian Guardsmen seemed to have lost nothing, and also to have learned
nothing, since their famous predecessors lay dead in their ranks before St.
Privat, forty-four years before. The attack was directed against the front of
the two divisions of the First British Army Corps, but especially on the 1st
Brigade, so that Guardsman faced Guardsman, as at Fontenoy. There were none of
the chivalrous greetings of 1745, however, and a stern hatred hardened the
hearts of either side. The German Guard charged on the north of the Menin road,
while a second advance by troops of the line was made upon the south, which
withered away before the British fire. Nothing could stop the Guards, however.
With trenches blazing and crackling upon their flank, for the advance was
somewhat diagonal, they poured over the British position and penetrated it at
three different points where the heavy shells had overwhelmed the trenches and
buried the occupants, who, in some cases, were bayoneted as they struggled out
from under the earth. It was a terrific moment. The yells of the stormers and
the shrill whistles of their officers rose above the crash of the musketry-fire
and roar of the guns. The British fought in their customary earnest silence,
save for the short, sharp directions of their leaders. "They did not seem
angry&mdash;only business-like," said a hostile observer. The troops to the
immediate north of the Menin road, who had been shelled out of their trenches
by the bombardment, were forced back and brushed aside into the woods to the
north, while the Germans poured through the gap. The 4th Royal Fusiliers of the
9th Brigade, upon the right of the point where the enemy had penetrated, were
enfiladed and lost their gallant colonel, MacMahon, a soldier who had done
great service from the day of Mons, and had just been appointed to a brigade.
The regiment, which has worked as hard and endured as great losses as any in
the campaign, was reduced to 2 officers and 100 men.</p>
<p>The German Guard poured on into the woods which lay in the immediate rear of
the British position, but their formation was broken and the individualism of
the Briton began to tell. Next to MacMahon' s regiment lay the 1st Scots
Fusiliers, sister battalion to that which had been destroyed upon October 31.
With fierce joy they poured volleys into the flank of the Guard as the grey
figures rushed past them into the woods. Four hundred dead Germans were
afterwards picked out from the underwood at this point. The Scots Fusiliers
were also hard hit by the German fire.</p>
<p>At this period the Germans who had come through the line had skirted the
south of a large wood of half-grown trees, called the Polygon Wood, and had
advanced into the farther one, named Nonnebusch. At this point they were close
to the British artillery, which they threatened to overwhelm. The 41st Brigade
R.F.A., and especially the 16th Field Battery, were in the immediate line of
their advance, and the gunners looking up saw the grey uniforms advancing amid
the trees. Colonel Lushington, who commanded the artillery brigade, hurriedly
formed up a firing line under his adjutant, composed partly of his own spare
gunners and partly of a number of Engineers, reinforced by cooks, officers'
servants, and other odd hands who are to be found in the rear of the army, but
seldom expect to find themselves in the van of the fight. It was a somewhat
grotesque array, but it filled the gap and brought the advance to a halt,
though the leading Germans were picked up afterwards within seventy yards of
the guns. Whilst the position was critical at this point of the front, it was
no less so upon the extreme right, where the French detachment, who still
formed a Link between the canal on the south and the British right flank, were
shelled out of their trenches and driven back. Lord Cavan's 4th Brigade, their
nearest neighbours, were too hard pressed to be able to help them. To the north
of the Menin road a number of British units were intact, and these held up the
German flood in that region. There are two considerable woods&mdash;the Polygon
to the north and the Nonnebusch to the south-west of the Polygon&mdash;the
edges of which have defined the British position, while their depths have
harboured their artillery. Now the 1st King's Liverpool Regiment held firm to
the south of the Polygon Wood, while north of them were the 2nd Highland Light
Infantry, with a field company of Engineers. Farther to the south-west were the
1st Connaught Rangers, while on the other side of the Nonnebusch road was the
7th Cavalry Brigade. In the afternoon of this day the enemy, skirting the south
of the Polygon Wood, had actually entered the Nonnebusch Wood, in which it
faced the artillery as already described. In the Polygon Wood, when they
penetrated the trenches of the 1st Brigade, they had the Bang's Liverpool
Regiment on their right, which refused to move, so that for a long time the
Prussian Guard and the King's lay side by side with a traverse between them.
"Our right is supported by the Prussian Guard," said the humorous adjutant of
the famous Lancashire regiment. While the main body of the Guard passed on,
some remained all day in this trench.</p>
<p>The German Guardsmen had been prevented from submerging the 41st Brigade of
Artillery, and also the 35th Heavy Battery, by the resistance of an improvised
firing line. But a more substantial defence was at hand. The 2nd Oxford and
Bucks Light Infantry, which had been in divisional reserve near Ypres, had been
brought forward and found itself at Westhoek, near the threatened guns. This
regiment is the old 52nd, of the Peninsular Light Division, a famous corps
which threw itself upon the flank of Napoleon's Guard at Waterloo and broke it
in the crisis of the battle. Once again within a century an Imperial Guard was
to recoil before its disciplined rush. Under Colonel Davies the regiment swept
through the wood from north-west to south-east, driving the Germans, who had
already been badly shaken by the artillery fire, in a headlong rout. Many threw
down their arms. The loss to the Oxfords was surprisingly small, well under
fifty in all. As they emerged from the wood they were joined by some of the 1st
Northamptons from the 2nd Brigade upon the right, while on the left there was a
rush of Connaughts and Highland Light Infantry from their own (Haking's)
brigade and of Engineers of the 25th Field Company, who showed extraordinary
initiative and gallantry, pushing on rapidly, and losing all their officers
save one and a number of their men without flinching for an instant. A party of
the Gloucesters, too, charged with the Northamptons upon the right, for by this
time units were badly mixed up, as will always happen in woodland fighting. "It
was all a confused nightmare," said one who tried to control it. The line of
infantry dashed forward, a company of the Oxfords under Captain H. M. Dillon in
the lead, and the khaki wave broke over a line of trenches which the Germans
had taken, submerging all the occupants. There was another line in front, but
as the victorious infantry pushed forward to this it was struck in the flank by
a fire from French batteries, which had been unable to believe that so much
progress could have been made in so short a time.</p>
<p>It was now nearly dark, and the troops were in the last stage of exhaustion.
Of the 1st Brigade something less than 400 with 4 officers could be collected.
It was impossible to do more than hold the line as it then existed. Two brave
attempts were made in the darkness to win back the original front trenches, but
it could not be done, for there were no men to do it. Save for one small comer
of the Polygon Wood, the Germans had been completely cleared out from the main
position. At twelve and at four, during the night, the British made a forward
movement to regain the advanced trenches, but in each case the advance could
make no progress. At the very beginning of the second attempt General
FitzClarence, commanding the 1st Brigade, was killed, and the movement fizzled
out. Besides General FitzClarence, the Army sustained a severe loss in General
Shaw of the 9th Brigade, who was struck by a shell splinter, though happily the
wound was not mortal. The German losses were exceedingly severe: 700 of their
dead were picked up within a single section of the British line, but the main
loss was probably sustained in the advance before they reached the trenches.
Killed, wounded, and prisoners, their casualties cannot have been less than
10,000 men.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[ * The German returns for the Guard alone at this battle
are reported at 1170 dead, 3991 wounded, 1719 missing. ]</p>
<p>It was a fine attack, bravely delivered by fresh troops against weary men,
but it showed the German leaders once for all that it was impossible to force a
passage through the lines. The Emperor's Guard, driven on by the Emperor's own
personal impetus, had recoiled broken, even as the Guard of a greater Emperor
had done a century before from the indomitable resistance of the British
infantry. The constant fighting had reduced British brigades to the strength of
battalions, battalions to companies, and companies to weak platoons, but the
position was still held. They had, it is true, lost about five hundred yards of
ground in the battle, but a shorter line was at once dug, organised, and
manned. The barrier to Ypres was as strong as ever.</p>
<p>The strain upon the men, however, had been terrific. "Bearded, unwashed,
sometimes plagued with vermin, the few who remained in the front line were a
terrible crew," says the American, Coleman. "They were like fierce, wild
beasts," says another observer. They had given their all, almost to their
humanity, to save Britain. May the day never come when Britain will refuse to
save them.</p>
<p>Glancing for a moment down the line to the south, there had been continuous
confused contention during this time, but no great attack such as distinguished
the operations in the north. Upon November 7 two brisk assaults were made by
the Germans in the Armenti&egrave;res area, one upon the Fourth Division of the
Third Corps and the other upon the Seaforth Highlanders, who were brigaded with
the Indians. In each case the first German rush carried some trenches, and in
each the swift return of the British regained them. There were moderate losses
upon both sides. On the same date the 13th Infantry Brigade lost the services
of Colonel Martyn of the 1st West Kents, who was seriously wounded the very day
after he had been appointed to a brigade.</p>
<p>This attack upon November 11 represents the absolute high-water mark of the
German efforts in this battle, and the ebb was a rapid one. Upon November 12
and the remainder of the week, halfhearted attempts were made upon the British
front, which were repulsed without difficulty. To the north of the line, where
the French had held their positions with much the same fluctuations which had
been experienced by their Allies, the German assault was more violent and met
with occasional success, though it was finally repelled with very great loss.
The 14th was to the French what the 11th had been to the British&mdash;the
culmination of violence and the prelude of rest. The weather throughout this
period was cold and tempestuous, which much increased the strain upon the weary
troops. Along the whole line from Ypres to Bethune there were desultory
shellings with an occasional dash by one side or the other, which usually ended
in the capture of a trench and its recapture by the supports in the rear. It
was in one of these sporadic German attacks in the Klein Zillebeke section that
the 2nd King's Royal Rifles held their trench against heavy odds, and their
machine-gun officer, Lieutenant Dimmer, thrice wounded and still fighting, won
the coveted Cross by his valour. Each gallant advance and capture of the
Germans was countered by an equally gallant counter-attack and recapture by the
British. The long line sagged and swayed, but never bent or broke. The era of
battles had passed, but for thirty miles the skirmishes were incessant. So
mixed and incessant had been the fighting that it was a very difficult task
during these days to tidy up the line and get each scattered group of men back
to its own platoon, company, and battalion.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, November 17, the fighting suddenly assumed a more important
character. The attack was again in the Ypres section and fell chiefly upon the
battalions of the Second Corps, if so dignified a name as " battalion " can be
given to bodies of men which consisted very often of less than a normal
company, commanded, perhaps, by two junior officers. The 4th Brigade of Guards
was also heavily engaged this day, and so were the cavalry of the Third
Division. The general locale of the action was the same as that which had been
so often fought over before, the Second Corps being to the south of the
Ypres-Menin road, with Lord Cavan's Guardsmen upon their right and the cavalry
upon the right of the Guards. After a severe shelling there was a serious
infantry advance, about one o'clock, which took some trenches, but was finally
driven back and chased for a quarter of a mile. McCracken's 7th Brigade bore a
chief part in this fighting, and the 1st Wiltshires particularly distinguished
themselves by a fine charge led by Captain Cary-Barnard. The 2nd Grenadiers did
great work during the day.</p>
<p>An even heavier advance was made in the afternoon to the south of that which
was broken in the morning. This involved an oblique advance across the British
front, which was stopped and destroyed before it reached the trenches by the
deadly fire of rifles and machine-guns. Over a thousand dead were left as a
proof of the energy of the attack and the solidity of the resistance. Farther
to the south a similar attack was beaten back by the cavalry after a
preliminary shelling in which the 3rd Dragoon Guards suffered severely. This
attack was repelled by the Third Cavalry Division, to which the Leicestershire
and North Somerset Yeomanry were now attached. The latter did fine service in
this action. Altogether, November 17 was a good day for the British arms and a
most expensive one for the Germans.</p>
<p>We have now reached the end of the Battle of Ypres, which attained its
maximum fury, so far as the British line was concerned, from October 29 to
November 11. This great contest raged from the sand dunes of the north, where
the Belgians fought so well, through the French Marine Brigade at Dixmude, and
the Ninth French Corps, to General Haig's Corps, which was buttressed on the
right towards the latter part of the battle by the Sixteenth French Corps.
Farther south yet another French corps supported and eventually took the place
of the British cavalry opposite the lost villages of Wytschaete and Messines.
From there ran the unbroken lines of the imperturbable Third Corps, which ended
to the south in the trenches originally held by the Second British Corps, and
later by the Indians. Across the La Bass&eacute;e Canal the French once again
took up the defence.</p>
<p>It is not an action, therefore, which can be set down to the exclusive
credit of any one nation. Our Allies fought gloriously, and if their deeds are
not set down here, it is from want of space and of precise information, not
from want of appreciation. But, turning to the merely British aspect of the
fight&mdash;and beyond all doubt the heavier share fell upon the British, who
bore the brunt from the start to the end,&mdash;it may be said that the battle
lasted a clear month, from October 12, when Smith-Dorrien crossed the La
Bass&eacute;e Canal, to November 11, when the German Guard reeled out of the
Nonnebusch Wood. We are so near these great events that it is hard to get their
true proportion, but it is abundantly clear that the battle, in its duration,
the space covered, the numbers engaged, and the losses endured, was far the
greatest ever fought up to that time by a British Army. At Waterloo the losses
were under 10,000. In this great fight they were little short of 50,000. The
fact that the enemy did not recoil and that there was no sensational capture of
prisoners and guns has obscured the completeness of the victory. In these days
of nations in arms a beaten army is buttressed up or reabsorbed by the huge
forces of which it is part. One judges victory or defeat by the question
whether an army has or has not reached its objective. In this particular case,
taking a broad view of the whole action, a German force of at least 600,000 men
set forth to reach the coast, and was opposed by a force of less than half its
numbers who barred its way. The Germans did not advance five miles in a month
of fighting, and they lost not less than 150,000 men without any military
advantage whatever, for the possession of such villages as Gheluvelt,
Wytschaete, or Messines availed them not at all. If this is not a great
victory, I do not know what military achievement would deserve the term. Ypres
was a Plevna&mdash;but a Plevna which remained for ever untaken.</p>
<p>On November 15 Lord Roberts died whilst visiting Army, having such an end as
he would have chosen, within earshot of the guns and within the lines of those
Indian soldiers whom he loved and had so often led. The last words of his
greatest speech to his fellow-countrymen before the outbreak of that war which
he had foreseen, and for which he had incessantly tried to prepare, were that
they should quit themselves like men. He lived to see them do so, and though he
was not spared to see the final outcome, his spirit must at least have been at
rest as to the general trend of the campaign. The tradition of his fascinating
character, with its knightly qualities of gentleness, bravery, and devotion to
duty, will remain as a national possession.</p>

<br>
<p>We have now arrived at what may be called the great winter lull, when the
continuation of active operations was made impossible by the weather
conditions, which were of the most atrocious description. It was the season
which in a more classic age of warfare was spent in comfortable winter
quarters. There was no such surcease of hardship for the contending lines, who
were left in their trenches face to face, often not more than fifty yards
apart, and each always keenly alert for any devilry upon the part of the other.
The ashes of war were always redly smouldering, and sometimes, as will be seen,
burst up into sudden furious flame. It was a period of rainstorms and of
frost-bites, of trench mortars and of grenades, of weary, muddy, goat-skinned
men shivering in narrow trenches, and of depleted brigades The first resting
and recruiting in the rearward towns. Such Ypres. was the position at the
Front. But hundreds of miles to the westward the real future of the war was
being fought out in the rifle factories of Birmingham, the great gun works of
Woolwich, Coventry, Newcastle, and Sheffield, the cloth looms of Yorkshire, and
the boot centres of Northampton. In these and many other places oversea the
tools for victory were forged night and day through one of the blackest and
most strenuous winters that Britain has ever known. And always on green and
waste and common, from Cromarty to Brighton, wherever soldiers could find
billets or a village of log huts could be put together, the soldier citizens
who were to take up the burden of the war, the men of the Territorials and the
men of the new armies, endured every hardship and discomfort without a murmur,
whilst they prepared themselves for that great and glorious task which the
future would bring. Even those who were too old or too young for service formed
themselves into volunteer bands, who armed and clothed themselves at their own
expense. This movement, which sprang first from the small Sussex village of
Crowborough, was co-ordinated and controlled by a central body of which Lord
Desborough was the head. In spite of discouragement, or at the best cold
neutrality from Government, it increased and prospered until no fewer than a
quarter of a million of men were mustered and ready entirely at their own
expense and by private enterprise&mdash;one of the most remarkable phenomena of
the war.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="chap10" name="chap10">X. A
RETROSPECT AND GENERAL SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p class="chaphead">Position of Italy&mdash;Fall of German colonies &mdash; Sea
affairs&mdash;Our Allies</p>
<p class="first">THERE has been no opportunity during this somewhat breathless
narrative of the great events which ever be associated with the names of Mens,
the Marne, the Aisne, and Ypres to indicate those factors which were
influencing the course of the war in other regions. They do not come properly
within the scope of this narrative, nor does the author profess to have any
special information concerning them, but they cannot be absolutely omitted
without interfering with a correct view of the general situation. They will
therefore be briefly summarised in retrospect before the reader is carried on
into a more particular account of the trench warfare of the early winter of
1914.</p>
<p>The most important European event at the outbreak of the war, outside the
movement of the combatants, was the secession of Italy from the Central Powers
on the grounds that her treaty applied only to wars of defence whilst this was
manifestly one of aggression. Italian statesmen could speak with the more
decision upon the point since the plot had been unfolded before their eyes. A
year previously they had been asked to join in an unprovoked attack upon
Serbia, and in refusing had given clear warning to their allies how such an
outrage would viewed. The Central Powers, however, puffed up general by their
vainglory and by the knowledge of their secret preparations, were persuaded
that they had ample strength to carry out their intentions without aid from
their southern ally. Italy, having denounced the treaty, remained a neutral,
but it was always clear that she would sooner or later throw in her strength
with those who were at war with Austria, her secular enemy. It was not,
however, until May 1915 that she was in a position to take a definite step. It
should be remembered to her eternal honour that the time at which she did
eventually come in was one which was very overcast for the Allies, and that far
from fulfilling the cynical German prophecy that she would "hasten to the
assistance of the conqueror," she took grave risks in ranging herself Fall of
upon the side of her Latin sister. Upon August 24 colonies. Japan also declared
war, and by November 7 had completed her share of the common task, for
Tsingtau, the only German colony in Eastern Asia, was captured by a Japanese
expeditionary force aided by a British contingent. Already the vast Colonial
erection of Germany, those numerous places in the sun which she had annexed all
over the globe, were beginning to crumble. The little Togoland colony fell upon
August 26. New Zealand took over German Samoa upon August 31. The Australians
occupied the Bismarck Archipelago upon September 7, and New Guinea upon the
25th. These smaller twigs were easily lopped, but the main boughs were made of
tougher stuff. A premature attack upon German East Africa by an expeditionary
force from India met with a severe check immediately after landing. In South
Africa the Germans succeeded in blowing into a small flame the smouldering
ashes of the old Boer War. De Wet and others broke their oaths and took up
arms, but the majority remained splendidly loyal, and by the beginning of
December Botha had brought the insurrection to an end, and was able henceforth
to devote his grand powers of leadership and organisation to the extinction of
the enemy's south-western colony.</p>
<p>A word, too, about sea affairs before we turn to the further detailed
account of the British winter upon the Continent. In good time the Fleet had
been ordered to her war-stations at the north and east of Scotland, with the
result that German ocean commerce was brought to an immediate and absolute
stop. The German ships <i>Goeben</i> and <i>Breslau</i>, which were cut off at
the outbreak of the war in the Mediterranean, succeeded in a very clever
fashion in reaching the Dardanelles and safety. Having taken refuge at
Constantinople, these ships played a prominent part in determining Turkey to
take action against the Allies on October 31, a most disastrous decision both
for Turkey, which met her ruin, and for the Allies, who found their task
greatly increased through the excellent fighting power of the Turkish
forces.</p>
<p>A brisk action was fought upon August 28 in the Heligoland Bight, when
Admiral Beatty with his cruiser-squadron and a number of light craft visited
the enemy in his own waters, sinking three German warships and sustaining no
losses himself. Among the prisoners was the son of Chief Admiral Von Tirpitz.
Numerous minor actions led to no noteworthy result, but the power of the
submarine, already prophesied before the war, speedily made itself manifest.
Several small British cruisers were destroyed by these craft, and finally a
considerable disaster occurred through the sinking of the three cruisers,
<i>Hogue</i>, <i>Aboukir</i>, and <i>Cressy</i>, upon September 22. This
dashing and cool-headed exploit was brought off by a young Lieutenant named
Weddigen. Much as we suffered from his action, it was recognised in Britain as
having been a remarkable deed of arms upon a very different plane to those
execrable murders of civilians with which the German submarine service was
afterwards associated. Some months later Weddigen's submarine rose amongst the
Grand Fleet whilst it was in motion, and was rammed and destroyed by the
<i>Dreadnought</i>.</p>
<p>The outbreak of war had seen a considerable number of German cruisers at
large, and these would undoubtedly have been strongly reinforced had it not
been for the speed with which the British Fleet took up its war-stations. As it
was, the amount of damage to commerce was not serious, and by the New Year all
the wanderers had been rounded up. The most successful raider was the
<i>Emden</i>, under Captain M&uuml;ller, which captured and destroyed numerous
British merchant-ships, bombarded the Madras gas-works, and sank by a surprise
attack a small Russian cruiser and a French destroyer before it was finally
cornered and sunk by the Australian cruiser <i>Sydney</i> off Cocos Island upon
November 10. Captain M&uuml;ller, though forced by circumstances to adopt
certain measures not recognised in honourable naval warfare, behaved on the
whole in the manner which one associates with the term naval officer. The
<i>Karlsruhe</i> had also considerable success as a naval raider, but met her
end through an unexplained explosion some little time after her consort the
<i>Emden</i>. On the whole, the damage inflicted by German commerce destroyers
was very much less than had been anticipated.</p>
<p>On November 1, Admiral Craddock's squadron, consisting of the
<i>Monmouth</i>, the <i>Good Hope</i>, and two small vessels, was engaged by a
superior squadron under Admiral von Spee at Coronel off the coast of Chile. The
result was a British defeat, the two cruisers being sunk by gun-fire with all
hands. This disaster was dramatically revenged, as within six weeks, upon
December 8, a special cruiser-squadron dispatched from England under Admiral
Sturdee entirely destroyed the fleet of Von Spee in the Battle of the Falkland
Islands. The British Fleet was considerably stronger, and little credit can be
claimed save for the admirable strategy which enabled Sturdee to find the enemy
in that vast waste of waters as promptly and directly as if the meeting had
been by appointment.</p>
<p>There were no other outstanding naval events in 1914 save a raid upon
Cuxhaven by aeroplanes, escorted by light cruisers, which probably did little
harm as the weather was misty. This occurred upon Christmas Day 1914. It had
been preceded by an attack by German cruisers on December 16 upon West
Hartlepool, Scarborough, and Whitby. As the two latter towns were open
watering-places, and as numerous civilians were the victims of the raid, it was
recognised from this time onwards that the German Navy was as little trammelled
by international law or by the feelings of humanity as the German Army had
shown itself to be in France, Belgium, and Russia.</p>
<p>The general movement of the French armies has been touched upon in recording
the experiences of the British, for after their glorious victory at the Marne
and the hold-up at the Aisne, it was at Ypres that the real fighting was done,
the rest of the long line down to the Swiss frontier playing a subsidiary part.
The Russians, however, had experienced both extremities of fortune, for their
victory at Lemberg over the Austrians upon September 2 was of a very glorious
character, while their defeat by the Germans at Tannenberg in East Prussia was
no less decisive.</p>
<p>All the events of the outset of the war were inglorious for Austria, who
received rapidly the punishment which she deserved for her wanton disturbance
of the world's peace. Apart from the blows which she received from Russia, she
was severely defeated by the Serbians on August 17, and her invading army was
driven out of the country which she had wronged. At the end of the year she had
lost the whole of Galicia to the Russians, who in turn had been pushed out of
East Prussia by the German armies under Von Hindenburg. An invasion of Poland
by the Germans was held up after very severe fighting, failing to reach Warsaw,
which was its objective.</p>
<p>These were the main incidents of the world's war during the months which
have been under review. As those months passed the terrific nature of the task
which they had undertaken became more and more clear to the British, but
further reflection had confirmed them in their opinion that the alternative
course of abandoning their friends and breaking their pledge to Belgium was an
absolutely unthinkable one, so that however great the trials and sacrifices in
blood and treasure, they were not further embittered by the reflection that
they could possibly a have been avoided. Very greatly were they cheered in that
dark hour by the splendid, whole-hearted help from India, Canada, Australia,
and New Zealand, help which was even more valuable from a moral than from a
material standpoint. With this brief synopsis we will now return to those
operations which are the proper subject of this volume.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="chap11" name="chap11">XI. THE
WINTER LULL OF 1914</a></h2>
<p class="chaphead">Increase of the Army&mdash;Formation of the Fifth Corps
&mdash;The visit of the King&mdash;Third Division at Petit Bois &mdash; The
fight at Givenchy&mdash;Heavy losses of the Indians&mdash;Fine advance of
Manchesters&mdash;Advance of the First Division&mdash;Singular scenes at
Christmas</p>
<p class="first">THE winter lull may be said to have extended from the great
combats at Ypres of the middle of November to the opening of the spring
campaign in March 1915; but we will only follow it here up to the end of the
year. It was a period of alternate rest and discomfort for the troops with an
ever-present salt of danger. For days they found themselves billeted with some
approach to comfort in the farmhouses and villages of Flanders, but such brief
intervals of peace were broken by the routine of the trenches, when, in mud or
water with a clay cutting before their faces and another at their backs, they
waited through the long hours, listening to the crack of the sniper's rifle, or
the crash of the bursting shell, with an indifference which bordered upon
thankfulness for anything that would break the drab monotony of their task. It
was a scene of warfare which was new to military experience. The vast plain of
battle lay in front of the observer as a flat and lonely wilderness, dotted
with ruined houses from which no homely wreath of smoke rose into the wintry
air. Here and there was an untidy litter of wire; here and there also a clump
of bleak and tattered woodland; but nowhere was there any sign of man. And yet
from the elevation of an aeroplane it might be seen that the population of a
large city was lurking upon that motionless waste. Everywhere the airman would
have distinguished the thin brown slits of the advance trenches, the broader
ditches of the supports and the long zigzags of the communications, and he
would have detected that they were stuffed with men &mdash;grey men and khaki,
in every weird garment that ingenuity could suggest for dryness and for
warmth&mdash;all cowering within their shelters with the ever-present double
design of screening themselves and of attacking their enemy. As the German
pressure became less, and as more regiments of the Territorials began to
arrive, taking some of the work from their comrades of the Regulars, it was
possible to mitigate something of the discomforts of warfare, to ensure that no
regiments should be left for too long a period in the trenches, and even to
arrange for week-end visits to England for a certain number of officers and
men. The streets of London got a glimpse of rugged, war-hardened faces, and of
uniforms caked with the brown mud of Flanders, or supplemented by strange
Robinson Crusoe goat-skins from the trenches, which brought home to the least
imaginative the nature and the nearness of the struggle.</p>
<p>Before noting those occasional spasms of activity&mdash;epileptic,
sometimes, in their sudden intensity&mdash;which broke out from the German
trenches, it may be well to take some note of the general development of those
preparations which meant so much for the future. The Army was growing steadily
in strength. Not only were the old regiments reinforced by fresh drafts, but
two new divisions of Regulars were brought over before the end of January.
These formed the Twenty-seventh and Twenty-eighth Divisions under Generals Snow
and Bulfin, two officers who had won a name in the first phase of the war. The
two Divisions together formed the Fifth Army Corps under General Plumer, the
officer who had worked so hard for the relief of Mafeking in 1900. The
Divisions, composed of splendid troops who needed some hardening after tropical
service, were constituted as follows, the list including territorial battalions
attached, but excluding the artillery as well as the four original regular
units in each brigade:</p>

<br>
<p>Besides this new Fifth Army Corps, there had been a constant dribble of
other territorial units to the front, where they were incorporated with various
regular brigades. The London Scottish, which had done so well, was honoured by
admission to the 1st Brigade of Guards. The Artists' Rifles, 28th London, had
the unique distinction of being set aside as an officers' training corps, from
which officers were actually drawn at the rate of a hundred a month. The
Honourable Artillery Company, brigaded with the 7th Brigade, was among the
first to arrive. Conspicuous among the newcomers were the London Rifle Brigade,
the 4th Suffolk, the Liverpool Scottish, the 5th and 6th Cheshires, the 1st
Herts, the 2nd Monmouthshires, Queen Victoria Rifles, and Queen's Westminsters.
These were among the earlier arrivals, though it seems invidious to mention
names where the spirit of all was equally good. Among the yeomanry, many had
already seen considerable service &mdash;notably the North and South Irish
Horse, who had served from the beginning, the Northumberland Hussars, the North
Somersets, the Oxford Hussars, and the Essex Yeomanry. Most of the troops named
above shared the discomfort of the winter campaign before the great arrival of
the new armies from England in the spring. There can be no better earned bar
upon a medal than that which stands for this great effort of endurance against
nature and man combined.</p>
<p>To take events in their order: beyond numerous gallant affairs of outposts,
there was no incident of importance until the evening of November 23, when the
Germans, who had seemed stunned for a week or so, showed signs of returning
animation. On this day, some eight hundred yards of trench held by Indian
troops in the neighbourhood of Armenti&egrave;res were made untenable by the
German artillery, especially by the <i>Minenwerfer</i> &mdash;small mortars
which threw enormous bombs by an ingenious arrangement whereby the actual shell
never entered the bore but was on the end of a rod outside the muzzle. Some of
these terrible missiles, which came through the air as slowly as a punted
football, were 200 lbs. in weight and shattering in their effects. There was an
advance of the 112th Regiment of the Fourteenth German Corps, and the empty
trenches were strongly occupied by them &mdash; so strongly that the first
attempt to retake them was unsuccessful in the face of the rifle and
machine-gun fire of the defenders. A second more powerful counter-attack was
organised by General Anderson of the Meerut Division, and this time the Germans
were swept out of their position and the line re-established. The fighting
lasted all night, and the Ghurkas with their formidable knives proved to be
invaluable for such close work, while a party of Engineers with hand-bombs did
great execution&mdash;a strange combination of the Asiatic with the most
primitive of weapons and the scientific European with the most recent. It was a
substantial victory as such affairs go, for the British were left with a
hundred prisoners, including three officers, three machine-guns, and two
mortars.</p>
<p>The first week of December was rendered memorable by a visit of the King to
the Army. King George reviewed a great number of his devoted soldiers, who
showed by their fervent enthusiasm that one need not be an autocratic Warlord
in order to command the fierce loyalty of the legions. After this pleasant
interlude there followed a succession of those smaller exploits which seem so
slight in any chronicle, and yet collectively do so much to sustain the spirit
of the Army. Now this dashing officer, now that, attempted some deed upon the
German line, and never failed to find men to follow him to death. On November
24 it was Lieutenant Impey, with a handful of 2nd Lincolns; on November 25,
Lieutenants Ford and Morris with a few Welsh Fusiliers and sappers; on November
26, Sir Edward Hulse with some Scots Guards; on the same day. Lieutenant Durham
with men of the 2nd Rifle Brigade&mdash;in each case trenches were temporarily
won, the enemy was damaged, and a spirit of adventure encouraged in the
trenches. Sometimes such a venture ended in the death of the leader, as in the
case of Captain the Honourable H. L. Bruce of the Royal Scots. Such men died as
the old knights did who rode out betwixt the lines of marshalled armies, loved
by their friends and admired by their foes.</p>
<p>December 9 was the date of two small actions. In the first the 1st Lincolns
of the 9th Brigade, which had been commanded by Douglas Smith since the
wounding of General Shaw, made an attack upon the wood at Wytschaete which is
called Le Petit Bois. The advance was not successful, the three officers who
led it being all wounded, and forty-four men being hit. The attempt was renewed
upon a larger scale five days later. The other action was an attack by the
enemy upon some of the trenches of the Third Corps. This Corps, though it had
not come in for the more dramatic scenes of the campaign, had done splendid and
essential work in covering a line of fourteen miles or so against incessant
attacks of the Germans, who never were able to gain any solid advantage. On
this occasion the impact fell upon Gordon's 19th Brigade, especially upon the
2nd Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and the 1st Middlesex. It was driven back
with heavy loss.</p>
<p>On December 14 the second and more sustained effort was made to get
possession of the Petit Bois at Wytschaete, which had been attacked by the
Lincolns upon the 9th. D'Urbal's Eighth French Army was co-operating upon the
left. The British attack was conducted by Haldane's Third Division, and the
actual advance was carried out, after a considerable artillery preparation from
the batteries of two Corps, by Bowes' 8th Brigade, with the 2nd Royal Scots and
the 1st Gordons in the lead. At 7:45 the guns were turned upon the big wood
beyond Petit Bois, through which the supports might be advancing, and at the
same hour the two regiments named swarmed forward, the Lowlanders on the left
and the Highlanders on the right. The Royal Scots, under Major Duncan, carried
Petit Bois with a rush, taking fifty prisoners and two machine-guns, while the
Germans fled out at the other end of the wood. The Scots at once entrenched
themselves and got their own machine guns into position. The Gordons, under
Major Baird, advanced with splendid dash and gained some ground, but found the
position such that they could not entrench upon it, so they were forced to fall
back eventually to their original position. Both they and the 4th Middlesex,
who supported them, lost considerably in the affair. The total casualties in
the Petit Bois action came to over four hundred, with seventeen officers,
figures which were considerably swollen by the losses of the Suffolks and Irish
Rifles, who continued to hold the captured position in the face of continued
bombing. The French in the north had no particular success and lost 600 men.
The importance of such operations is not to be measured, however, by the amount
of ground won, but by the necessity of beating up the enemies' quarters,
keeping them pinned to their positions, and preventing them from feeling that
they could at their own sweet wills detach any reinforcements they chose to
thicken their line upon the Eastern frontier, where our Russian Allies were so
insistently pressing.</p>
<p>On the morning of December 19 an attack was made upon the German lines in
the Festubert region by Willcocks' Indian Corps, the Meerut Division, under
General Anderson, attacking upon the left, and the Lahore, under General
Watkis, upon the right. The object of the movement was to co-operate with the
French in an advance which they had planned. The Meerut attack was successful
at first, but was driven back by a counter-attack, and some hundreds of Indian
infantry were killed, wounded, or taken. In the case of the Lahore attack the
storming party consisted of the 1st Highland Light Infantry and the 4th
Ghurkas. Both of these units belong to the Sirhind Brigade, but they were
joined in the enterprise by the 59th Scinde Rifles of the Jullundur Brigade.
These latter troops had a long night march before reaching the scene of the
operations, when they found themselves upon the right of the attack and within
two hundred and fifty yards of the German trenches. Judging the operations from
the standard reached at a later date, the whole arrangement seems to have been
extraordinarily primitive. The artillery preparation for a frontal attack upon
a strong German line of trenches lasted exactly four minutes, being rather a
call to arms than a bombardment. The troops rushed most gallantly forward into
the dark of a cold wet winter morning, with no guide save the rippling flashes
of the rifles and machine-guns in front of them. Many were so sore-footed and
weary that they could not break into the double. Some of the Indians were
overtaken from behind by a line of British supports, which caused considerable
confusion. An officer of Indians has left it on record that twice running he
had a revolver clapped to his head by a British officer. All of the battalions
advanced with a frontage of two companies in columns of platoons. Both the
Ghurkas and Highlanders reached the trench in the face of a murderous fire. The
left of the 59th, consisting of Punjabi Mahomedans, also reached the trench.
The right, who were Sikhs, made an equally gallant advance, but were knee-deep
in a wet beetroot field and under terrific machine-gun fire. Their gallant
leader, Captain Scale, was struck down. as was every Indian officer, but a
handful of the survivors, under a Sikh Jemadar, got into a German sap, which
they held for twenty-four hours, taking a number of prisoners.</p>
<p>Day had dawned, and though the British and Indians were in the enemy
trenches, it was absolutely impossible to send them up reinforcements across
the bullet-swept plain. The 59th discovered a sap running from their left to
the German line, and along this they pushed. They could not get through,
however, to where their comrades were being terribly bombed on either flank by
the counter-attack. It was an heroic resistance. Colonel Ronaldson, who led the
party, held on all day, but was very lucky in being able to withdraw most of
the survivors after nightfall. Of the hundred Punjabis who held one flank, only
three returned, while thirteen wounded were reported later from Germany. The
others all refused to surrender, declaring that those were the last orders of
their British officers, and so they met their honoured end. It had been a long
and weary day with a barren ending, for all that had been won was abandoned.
The losses were over a thousand, and were especially heavy in the case of
officers.</p>
<p>The Germans, elated by the failure of the attack, were in the mood for a
return visit. In the early dawn of the next day, December 20, they began a
heavy bombardment of the Indian trenches, followed by an infantry attack
extending over a line of six miles from south of the Bethune Canal to Festubert
in the north. The attack began by the explosion of a succession of mines which
inflicted very heavy losses upon the survivors of the Ghurkas and Highland
Light Infantry. The weight of the attack at the village of Givenchy fell upon
the exhausted Sirhind Heavy Brigade, who were driven back, and the greater part
of Givenchy was occupied by the enemy. General Brunker fell back with his
Brigade, but his line was stiffened by the arrival of the 47th Sikhs of the 8th
Jullundur Brigade, who were in divisional reserve. These troops prevented any
further advance of the Germans, while preparations were made for an effective
counter-stroke.</p>
<p>Little help could be given from the north, where the line was already
engaged, but to the south there were considerable bodies of troops available.
The situation was serious, and a great effort was called for, since it was
impossible to abandon into the hands of the enemy a village which was an
essential bastion upon the line of defence. The German attack had flooded down
south of Givenchy to the Bethune Canal, and a subsidiary attack had come along
the south of the Canal with the object of holding the troops in their places
and preventing the reinforcement of the defenders of Givenchy. But these
advances south of the village made no progress, being held up by the 9th
Bhopals and Wilde's 57th Rifles of the 7th Ferozepore Brigade between Givenchy
and the canal, while the 1st Connaught Rangers of the same brigade stopped it
on the southern side of the canal. Matters were for a moment in equilibrium. To
the south of the canal energetic measures were taken to get together a force
which could come across it by the Pont Fixe or road bridge, and reestablish
matters in the north.</p>
<p>The struggle had broken out close to the point of junction between the
British forces and those of General Foch of the Tenth French Army, so that our
Allies were able to co-operate with us in the counter-attack. It was directed
by General Carnegy, and the assault was made by the 1st Manchesters, the 4th
Suffolk Territorials, and some French territorials. The Manchesters, under the
leadership of Colonel Strickland, made a most notable attack, aided by two
companies of the Suffolks, the other companies remaining in reserve on the
north bank of the canal. So critical was the position that the 3rd Indian
Sappers and Miners were set the dangerous task, under very heavy shell-fire, of
mining the bridge over the canal. The situation was saved, however, by Colonel
Strickland's fine advance. His infantry, with very inadequate artillery
support, pushed its way into Givenchy and cleared the village from end to end.
Three hundred of the Manchesters fell in this deed of arms. Not only did they
win the village, but they also regained some of the lost trenches to the
north-east of Givenchy. This was the real turning-point of the action. There
was at the time only the one very wet, very weary, and rather cut-up Jullundur
Brigade between the Germans and Bethune&mdash;with all that Bethune stood for
strategically. To the east the 9th Bhopals and 57th Rifles still held on to
their position. It was only to the north that the enemy retained his
lodgment.</p>
<p>But the fight to the north had been a bitter one all day, and had gone none
too well for the British forces. The Indians were fighting at an enormous
disadvantage. As well turn a tiger loose upon an ice-floe and expect that he
will show all his wonted fierceness and activity. There are inexorable axioms
of Nature which no human valour nor constancy can change. The bravest of the
brave, our Indian troops were none the less the children of the sun, dependent
upon warmth for their vitality and numbed by the cold wet life of the trenches.
That they still in the main maintained a brave, uncomplaining, soldierly
demeanour, and that they made head against the fierce German assaults, is a
wonderful proof of their adaptability.</p>
<p>About ten o'clock on the morning of the 20th the German attack, driving back
the Sirhind Brigade from Givenchy, who were the left advanced flank of the
Lahore Division, came with a rush against the Dehra-Dun Brigade, who were the
extreme right of the Meerut Division. This Brigade had the 1st Seaforth
Highlanders upon its flank, with the 2nd Ghurkas upon its left. The Ghurkas
were forced to retire, and the almost simultaneous retirement of the defenders
of Givenchy left the Highlanders in a desperate position with both flanks in
the air. Fortunately the next Brigade of the Meerut Division, the Garhwal
Brigade, stood fast and kept in touch with the 6th Jats, who formed the left of
the Dehra Dun Brigade, and so prevented the pressure upon that side from
becoming intolerable. The 9th Ghurkas came up to support the 2nd Ghurkas, who
had not gone far from their abandoned trenches, and the 58th Indian Rifles also
came to the front. These battalions upon the left rear of the Highlanders gave
them some support. None the less the position of the battalion was dangerous
and its losses heavy, but it faced the Germans with splendid firmness, and
nothing could budge it. Machine-guns are stronger than flesh and blood, but the
human spirit can be stronger than either. You might kill the Highlanders, but
you could not shift them. The 2nd Black Watch, who had been in reserve,
established touch towards nightfall with the right of the Seaforths, and also
with the left of the Sirhind Brigade, so that a continuous line was
assured.</p>
<p>In the meantime a small force had assembled under General MacBean with the
intention of making a counter-attack and recovering the ground which had been
lost on the north side of Givenchy, With the 8th Ghurkas and the 47th Sikhs,
together with the 7th British Dragoon Guards, an attack was made in the early
hours of the 21st. Colonel Lempriere of the Dragoon Guards was killed, and the
attack failed. It was renewed in the early hours of the morning, but it again
failed to dislodge the Germans from the captured trenches.</p>
<p>December 21 dawned upon a situation which was not particularly rosy from a
British point of view. It is true that Givenchy had been recovered, but a
considerable stretch of trenches were still in the hands of the Germans, their
artillery was exceedingly masterful, and the British line was weakened by heavy
losses and indented in several places. The one bright spot was the advance of
the First Division of Haig's Corps, who had come up in the night-time. The
three brigades of this Division were at once thrown into the fight, the first
being sent to Givenchy, the second given as a support to the Meerut Division,
and the third directed upon the trenches which had been evacuated the day
before by the Sirhind Brigade. All of these brigades won their way forward, and
by the morning of the 22nd much of the ground which had been taken by the
Germans was reoccupied by the British. The 1st Brigade, led by the Cameron
Highlanders, had made good all the ground between Givenchy and the canal.
Meanwhile the 3rd Brigade had re-established the Festubert position, where the
2nd Welsh and 1st South Wales Borderers had won their way into the lost
trenches of the Ghurkas. This was not done without very stark fighting, in
which of all the regiments engaged none suffered so heavily as the 2nd Munsters
(now attached to the 3rd Brigade). This regiment, only just built up again
after its practical extermination at &Eacute;treux in August, made a grand
advance and fought without cessation for nearly forty-eight hours. Their losses
were dreadful, including their gallant Colonel Bent, both Majors Day and
Thomson, five other officers, and several hundreds of the rank and file. So far
forward did they get that it was with great difficulty that the survivors,
through the exertions of Major Ryan, were got back into a place of safety. It
was the second of three occasions upon which this gallant Celtic battalion gave
itself for King and Country. Let this soften the asperity of politics if
unhappily we must come back to them after the war.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the lines upon the flank of the Seaforths which had been lost by
the Dehra-Dun Brigade were carried by the 2nd Brigade (Westmacott), the 1st
North Lancashire and 1st Northamptons leading the attack with the 2nd Rifles in
support. Though driven back by a violent counter-attack in which both leading
regiments, and especially the Lancashire men, lost heavily, the Brigade came
again, and ended by making good the gap in the line. Thus the situation on the
morning of the 22nd looked very much better than upon the day before. On this
morning, as so many of the 1st Corps were in the advanced line, Sir Douglas
Haig took over the command from Sir James Willcocks. The line had been to some
extent re-established and the firing died away, but there were some trenches
which were not retaken till a later date.</p>
<p>Such was the scrambling and unsatisfactory fight of Givenchy, a violent
interlude in the drab records of trench warfare. It began with a considerable
inroad of Germans into our territory and heavy losses of our Indian Contingent.
It ended by a general return of the Germans to their former lines, and the
resumption by the veteran troops of the First Division of the main positions
which we had lost. Neither side had gained any ground of material value, but
the balance of profit in captures was upon the side of the Germans, who may
fairly claim that the action was a minor success for their arms, since they
assert that they captured some hundreds of prisoners and several machine-guns.
The Anglo-Indian Corps had 2600 casualties, and the First Corps 1400, or 4000
in all. The Indian troops were now withdrawn for a rest, which they had well
earned by their long and difficult service in the trenches. To stand day after
day up to his knees in ice-cold water is no light ordeal for a European, but it
is difficult to imagine all that it must have been to a Southern Asiatic. The
First Corps took over the La Bass&eacute;e lines.</p>
<p>About the same date as the Battle of Givenchy there was some fighting
farther north at Rouge Banc, where the Fourth Corps was engaged and some German
trenches were taken. The chief losses in this affair fell upon those war-worn
units, the 2nd Scots Guards and 2nd Borderers of the 20th Brigade. Henceforward
peace reigned along the lines for several weeks&mdash;indeed Christmas brought
about something like fraternisation between British and Germans, who found a
sudden and extraordinary link in that ancient tree worship, long anterior to
Christianity, which Saxon tribes had practised in the depths of Germanic
forests and still commemorated by their candle-lit firs. For a single day the
opposing forces mingled in friendly conversation and even in games. It was an
amazing spectacle, and must arouse bitter thoughts concerning those high-born
conspirators against the peace of the world, who in their mad ambition had
hounded such men on to take each other by the throat rather than by the hand.
For a day there was comradeship. But the case had been referred to the God of
Battles, and the doom had not yet been spoken. It must go to the end. On the
morning of the 26th dark figures vanished reluctantly into the earth, and the
rifles cracked once more. It remains one human episode amid all the atrocities
which have stained the memory of the war.</p>
<p>So ended 1914, the year of resistance. During it the Western Allies had been
grievously oppressed by their well-prepared enemy. They had been overweighted
by numbers and even more so by munitions. For a space it had seemed as if the
odds were too much for them. Then with a splendid rally they had pushed the
enemy back. But his reserves had come up and had proved to be as superior as
his first line had been. But even so he had reached his limit. He could get no
further. The danger hour was past. There was now coming the long, anxious year
of equilibrium, the narrative of which will be given in the succeeding volume
of 1915. Finally will come the year of restoration which will at least begin,
though it will not finish, the victory of the champions of freedom.</p>
