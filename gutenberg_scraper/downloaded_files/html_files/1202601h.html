<p class="first">WHEN the year 1918 had run half its course the Germans
appeared to be triumphantly in the ascendant. In Flanders they had pushed back
the British to positions which were, on an average, to the rear of those
occupied in 1914. On the Somme they had more than neutralised all the Allied
gains of 1916, and were stretched now from Arras to Montdidier, covering ground
which they had not touched since the early days of the war. On the Aisne they
had reconquered all that the French had so laboriously won in three campaigns,
and were back along the Marne and within gun-shot of Paris. These results had
been achieved in three great battles which had cost the Allies some 200,000
prisoners and nearly 2000 guns. In July it would have seemed that the German
Empire was victorious, and yet ere the year had ended the very name had changed
its meaning in the map of Europe, and was known only in the list of evil things
which have had their day and then have passed. How this extraordinary
change&mdash;the most sudden and dramatic in all history&mdash;came to pass is
the theme of this final volume.</p>
<p>There were certain factors which even at the zenith of Germany's fortunes
may have prepared a cool-headed critic for a swing of the scales, though the
wisest and best informed could not have conceived how violent the oscillation
would be. In the first place, the ever-pressing strangle-hold of the Navy,
combined with an indifferent harvest and the exhaustion of certain stocks
within the Empire, notably of copper, rubber, wool, and lubricants, produced
great internal difficulties which grew worse with every month. Then again
German successes had been bought in reckless fashion at a very heavy price, and
if they brought a million men across from the Russian frontier it is probable
that they had squandered nearly as many in the three great battles. Finally,
there was the all-important factor of the American reinforcements which had
been speeded up to meet the pressing emergency. By splendid international
co-operation the Americans put all their proverbial energy into marshalling and
equipping the men, while Great Britain threw every available unit of her sea
power, mercantile or naval, into the task of getting them across. The
long-suffering people of this island gladly cut down their requirements in
every possible direction so as to secure the tonnage for this marvellous
transfer. At a steady rate of a quarter of a million every month the Americans
flowed into France&mdash;magnificent raw material which was soon to show how
quickly it could develop into the most highly finished article. This constant
addition to the Allied forces, with the moral confidence which they brought
with them, was the third contributory cause to the sudden change of fortune. It
would be ungenerous, however, not to add that a fourth, without which all
others might have been vain, lay in the commanding personality and
extraordinary genius of the great Frenchman who now controlled the whole Allied
battle front from the sea to the Alps, while two great civilians, Lloyd George
and Clemenceau, rallied the home fronts of the two weary nations which had
borne the brunt of the war.</p>
<p>It will be remembered from the last volume that in the first half of 1918
the sun of victory had never once in Western Europe rested upon the standards
of the Allies save in Italy, where the Austrians had been defeated upon the
Piave. June 17 was in truth the turning-point of the war, for from that date
everything went well with the forces of freedom. The change in the West came
later, however, than in Italy, and on July 16 the Germans attempted a new
advance upon the largest scale, which seemed to have some small success at
first though it was in truth the starting-point of all their misfortunes. Their
previous advances had brought them forward on the line from Montdidier to
Rheims, and now they enlarged their front by 25 miles on the eastern side of
Rheims, while their attack also covered about the same distance to the west of
that city, making some progress in this latter sector, which led them down the
valley of the Oise, towards Villers-Cotterets, Compi&egrave;gne, and finally
Paris. The whole world held its breath in a hush of horror as it saw Foch's
soldiers desperately struggling and yet losing mile after mile of the short
stretch which separated the Teutonic barbarians from the centre of the world's
civilisation and culture. They had crossed the Marne that evening and had
pushed the French and American line back for some miles, but the latter rallied
and regained some of the ground. The most important point of the struggle,
however, was to the east of Rheims, where that splendid soldier, General
Gouraud, a one-armed bearded veteran of Gallipoli, created a false front which
the enemy captured, and then whilst they were still in disorder attacked them
from the real front, pushing them back with great loss. This development on the
east of the line fully compensated for the German advance on the west, which
was brought to a final halt within two days. Foch had now bled the Germans
until they had lost some of their power of resistance. The moment for his great
counter-attack was at hand, and the carefully husbanded reserves were ready for
the crisis&mdash;those reserves which it was his supreme merit to have hoarded
up when the temptation to spend them was more than the firmest will could have
been expected to resist.</p>
<p>On July 18 the blow fell, and the Germans recoiled in a movement which was
destined never to stop until they had crossed the Rhine. All important as the
operations were they are only indicated here since this chronicle is
necessarily confined to the British action, and no British troops were as yet
engaged. Issuing under the cover of a storm from the great forest of
Villers-Cotterets which had screened his preparations, the French Marshal
hurled his line of tanks upon the enemy, clearing a path for his infantry. At
the same moment the French-American line went forward over a front of 27 miles
from the Oise to the Marne, striking the whole flank of the German advance. The
attack extended from Vingre in the north to Ch&acirc;teau-Thierry. Everywhere
the German flank fell back, their front had to withdraw across the Marne,
Ch&acirc;teau-Thierry was reoccupied and 20,000 prisoners with 400 guns were
left in the hands of the victors. Gradually, as the attack developed from day
to day, a huge pocket was formed, bulging southwards from the Aisne, with its
lower edge upon the Marne, the whole assuming much the shape which Spain does
upon the map of Europe. This protrusion, instead of being a menacing point
directed towards Paris, was now a much battered salient attacked simultaneously
upon all sides, by Mangin in the west and by Gouraud in the south and east.
Americans and French were on the Marne, French alone to the west of it, and
British with French on the east of it. All were fighting with the cold fury of
men who have reached a crisis where death is nothing and victory all. Nurses at
the forward hospitals have testified how the French wounded were brought in
mutilated and dying, but delirious with joy because they knew that the tide had
turned. What matter anything else&mdash; What matter life or limb&mdash; The
grey cloud was slowly, slowly drifting back whence it came.</p>
<p>But it was very slow, for the German soldier had never fought better, nor
had his leaders ever shown greater skill in drawing him out from danger and yet
selling every rearward position at the highest price of Allied blood. All three
Allies were tried to their utmost, for the enemy had not yet learned that he
was fated to retreat. The British, who had their own great task already
planned, were in weak force, though that force was of the highest quality, for
two better divisions than Campbell's Fifty-first Highlanders and Braithwaite's
Sixty-second Yorkshiremen did not exist in the Army. It is their operations
which we have now to examine, since the grand work of their American
comrades-in-arms can only be included in the scope of this work where they
actually fought in the British formations.</p>
<p>They occupied a point on the eastern face of the attack, nearly midway
between the Marne and Rheims, and it was their task to force their way up that
valley of the Ardres down which the remains of the British Ninth Corps had
retreated from the disaster of the Aisne, and across which the Nineteenth
Division had been drawn when it stopped the German advance near Bligny, as
described in the last volume. Some memory of island valour should linger in
that valley, for much good British blood has been shed there. The two divisions
which were now hurried up to take their place in the French line formed the
Twenty-second Corps under Sir John Godley, and were accompanied by some New
Zealand and Australian Cavalry. They relieved a mauled Italian Corps, while
they had Frenchmen on their left and Algerians on their right, so that it would
be difficult to cosmopolitan line of defence. The country in front was hilly
and very difficult, and the line was bisected by the River Ardres, the
Sixty-second advancing on the right of the stream and the Fifty-first on the
left.</p>
<p>It was a very desperate and difficult business, which lasted for ten days,
during which each division showed the most splendid courage and endurance, as
can be proved by the fact that their united losses came to 8000 men out of
about 16,000 engaged, and that they met and defeated four German divisions,
capturing 1500 prisoners, 140 machine-guns, and 40 cannon. The opening attack,
during which the advancing lines passed through the ranks of the Second Italian
Corps, was greatly stimulated by the news of the splendid Allied advance of the
two previous days, July 18 and 19.</p>
<p>The fighting of both divisions was made very difficult by the underwood and
the standing corn which lay before them, thickly sown with German machine-guns.
On July 20 the 2/4th York and Lancasters, on the extreme right of the British
line, captured Bouilly, but were driven out again. At the same time the 5th
Yorkshire Light Infantry was held up and lost heavily in front of the
Ch&acirc;teau of Commetreuil. It was a long, difficult, and expensive day for
the 187th Brigade, and its only remaining battalion, the 2/4th Yorkshire Light
Infantry, lost heavily as well.</p>
<p>The 185th Brigade on July 20 occupied the left of the divisional line, with
the Highlanders on the other side of the Ardres. Marfaux and Cuitron lay before
them, but neither could be quite reached, though again and again the assailants
were on the very edge of the villages. Once some of the men of the 2/4th
Hampshires from the supporting brigade actually penetrated the village, but
they were seen no more. The 2/4th West Ridings, south of the village, were also
held up. Meanwhile the 5th West Ridings attempted to work around Marfaux from
the north, through the wood of Petit Camp. All attempts to debouch from the
wood were vain, however, and again the attack was brought to nought, home
ground had been gained during the day, but both main efforts had failed, and
all three brigades of the Sixty-second Division had been badly mauled. With no
British reserves behind, General Braithwaite must have been sorely exercised in
his mind that night.</p>
<p>On July 21 the attack eased down on the left, but on the right the 187th
Brigade deployed and attacked the Bouilly Ridge. The 9th Durham Pioneers made a
very fine advance, as did the 2/4th York and Lancasters, and some valuable
ground was taken, but none of the villages. The attackers were encouraged,
however, by learning from prisoners that the Germans had endured heavy losses,
and had been compelled to demand reinforcements.</p>
<p>On July 22 the situation began to clear a little as Burnett's 106th Brigade,
represented mainly by the 5th West Ridings, attacked the wood of Petit Camp, an
ominous grove, already littered with British dead. So deliberate was their
advance, in consequence of the difficult ground to be searched, that the
barrage was at the rate of 100 yards in ten minutes. The place was one long
succession of gun posts "en echelon," which were so concealed that they had no
field of fire, and were the more deadly on that account as they fired by sound
out of the bushes, and could not possibly be seen until one walked up to them.
None the less the Yorkshiremen, helped by a wing of the 5th Devons, fought
their way through this dreadful wood, dropping small posts as they went. Two
hundred prisoners and 41 machine-guns remained in their hands, with 700 yards
of new ground. The German losses were heavy but so were the British, Captain
Cockhill's company of the West Ridings emerging with two officers and six men
able to report for duty. It was a fine operation, well conceived and well
carried through. The Germans fought with great tenacity all day.</p>
<p>On July 23 the south-western corner of the Petit Camp Wood, which was still
in German hands, was cleared by the 6th West Ridings. The main attack, however,
on Marfaux and Cuitron was carried out by the Durhams and the New Zealand
Cyclist Battalion with magnificent success. Marfaux fell to the New Zealanders.
The stormers broke through both villages and made their line 400 yards beyond.
Two French tanks did good service in this assault. Two hundred prisoners and
eight French 75's, taken previously by the Germans, were among the trophies of
this fine advance. The Seventy-seventh French Division had attacked upon the
right with equal success.</p>
<p>Up to this period the Highlanders of the Fifty-first Division had been
striving hard on the southern side of the Ardres, with a task which was not
less difficult than that of their English comrades on the north.</p>
<p>On July 20 they found the enemy opposite to them in great strength, as was
shown by the fact that prisoners from three divisions, the Twenty-second
(Saxe-Meiningen), the Hundred and third (Hessian), and the Hundred and
twenty-third (Saxon) were taken that day. The great straggling wood of Courton,
with a fringe of farms, mills, and other buildings, formed a strong advanced
position. The Fifty-first Division has gained so splendid a record in the war
that advantage may be taken of this action to give in fuller detail its
glorious units. The attack that morning was carried out by the 154th Brigade,
consisting of the 4th Seaforths, 4th Gordons, and 7th Argyll and Sutherlands,
on the right flank. On the left was the 153rd Brigade, consisting of the 6th
and 7th Black Watch and 7th Gordons. In reserve was the 152nd Brigade, 5th and
6th Seaforths and 6th Gordons, with the 8th Royal Scots as pioneer battalion.
The attack was supported by French artillery and also by the guns of the 255th
and 256th Brigades R.F.A.</p>
<p>The advance was a most arduous one, especially after the first victorious
rush when the troops found themselves involved in the thick brushwood which
prevented co-operation to such an extent that the two brigades were entirely
separated, but each struggled on independently, small knots of determined men
fighting their way forward as best they might. The progress was better upon the
left than on the right, but the casualties were heavy, for the German
machine-guns had survived the barrage and were very deadly. Colonel Bickmore of
the 4th Gordons led a company of his battalion against a German post but was
brought down by a bomb, and his men driven back. When the ground was recovered
the Colonel had been carried off as a prisoner. The German infantry seem to
have taken hardly any part in the battle, which was fought between the splendid
Scottish infantry on one side, and the determined German machine-gunners on the
other. The Black Watch of the 153rd Brigade found an even blacker watch
fighting on their flank, for the Senegalese infantry of the French Ninth
Division went forward with them and did good work during he whole arduous day.
So sweeping was the machine-gun fire that at many points it was found to be
impossible even to creep forward through the two-foot corn.</p>
<p>By evening the attack had been definitely held, and the Highlanders were
forced to be content with their initial gains, while the French on the left,
who had been assaulting the hamlet of Paradis all day, were also stationary. At
6.30 a company of German infantry attacked the Argylls, but were driven back
with heavy loss. So the long day ended, the troops being much exhausted. The
capture of 8 officers and 360 men, with many machine-guns, was an inadequate
return for such heroic exertions. All day the enemy had been withdrawing upon
the Marne front, and the holding of his flanks was so vitally essential that he
was prepared to make any sacrifice for the purpose.</p>
<p>The attack was continued next morning, the 152nd Brigade pushing forward
into the front line, while the other depleted units supported it and guarded
its flanks. Things went badly at the outset, for the line had been altered
during the night and the barrage was miscalculated in consequence, so that it
was no great help to the 6th Gordons in their advance. All day mixed fighting
went on in the wood, and it was most difficult to determine the exact position
of the various units, groups of men stalking the machine-guns as hunters might
stalk tigers, the fight ending as often in the death of the hunter as of the
tiger. Once again the evening of a bloody day found things very much as they
had been in the morning. It cannot be denied that the German resistance was a
very stern one.</p>
<p>After a pause of a day the Highland Division renewed its attack along a
portion of its front, the main advance being carried out by the 152nd Brigade.
Once more the deadly woods were penetrated, and once more there was a limited
advance and considerable losses. On this occasion the barrage was more useful,
though some French batteries on the left fell short and caused heavy casualties
to a company of the 6th Gordons in their point of assembly. Such are the
unavoidable chances of modern warfare. The 8th Royal Scots were thrown into the
fight, and made a fine advance. Altogether there were signs this day of a
weakening on the German front, which was confirmed in the patrol fighting of
the next few days. There were many casualties in the 152nd Brigade, including
Major Moir, CO. of the 5th Seaforths, who was badly wounded.</p>
<p>Major operations were in abeyance until July 27, when severe fighting broke
out once again upon the south side of the Ardres. The 187th Brigade had been
sent across by General Braithwaite, and it now took its place in General
Carter-Campbell's sector, with the 152nd on its right and the 153rd on its
left, with the intention of making a vigorous attack upon the German line on
this front. Tanks had been allotted, but rain had set in, the ground was
marshy, and the monsters immovable. All immediate objectives were easily taken.
The villages of Espilly and Nappes had both been occupied. So soft did the
front appear that the Australian horsemen were pushed forward, while the troops
north of the river moved on in sympathy. The final line was north-west of
Chaumuzy. Here, on July 28, a very stiff German resistance was encountered, and
Chambrecy on the left flank represented the No Man's Land between the
armies.</p>
<p>The Montagne de Bligny position, where the Nineteenth Division had
distinguished itself in June, now lay immediately ahead, and the 8th West
Yorkshires (Leeds Rifles) were ordered to attack it. They went forward so
swiftly and with such spirit that they were into and over the position before
the Germans realised what had happened. It was a notable performance, for the
place was of great strength and strategic significance. The French Government
bestowed a special mark of honour upon the 8th West Yorks for this deed, and it
is certainly a singular coincidence that, of the few British battalions thus
honoured, two should have won it at the same spot. There was no artillery
support, and the casualties were heavy, but Yorkshire won home in spite of it.
The enemy tried to regain it until the high corn was full of his dead, but it
was all in vain. This day, with the co-operation of the French, Bligny village
was also taken. No further ground was gained on July 29, as a new German
division, the Two hundred and fortieth, had come into line with orders to hold
on at all costs. The fighting was very severe at the junction between the
French and British, where the liaison was so close between the two nations that
it is on record that, when at a critical moment the French ran out of
cartridges, the rifles and ammunition of the British casualties were handed
over to them and saved the situation. Shortly afterwards the two British
divisions were drawn from the line and returned to their own army. In a
generous appreciation of their services General Berthelot, after enumerating
their captures, said:</p>
<p>"Thanks to the heroic courage and proverbial tenacity of the British, the
continued efforts of this brave Army Corps have not been in vain....You have
added a glorious page to your history. Marfaux, Chaumuzy, Montague de
Bligny&mdash;all those famous names will be written in letters of gold in the
annals of your regiments." The French official bulletins offered also a very
special tribute of praise to the 6th Black Watch, a Perthshire battalion,
which, under Colonel Tarleton, had done particularly fine work during the long
and arduous service of the Fifty-first Division.</p>
<p>Whilst the Twenty-second British Corps had, as described, distinguished
itself greatly in the valley of the Ardres on the east of the German salient,
the Fifteenth Scottish Division under General H. L. Heed, V.C., had been
detailed to aid the French line in its advance on Buzancy on the western German
flank. This veteran division was thrown into the fight on July 28, and made its
mark at once upon the formidable German position which faced it. It had
relieved the First American Division which was much worn by its long and
splendid service in General Mangin's Tenth Army. The Americans left their guns
in the line to cover the advance, so that, for the first time in history,
British, Americans, and French were all engaged as allies upon the same
battleground The village was very strongly held, and the high ground to the
east of it was bristling with machine-guns, but the Scots infantry would take
no denial. The 44th Brigade (Thomson) had attacked the village itself, the 5th
Gordons and 8th Seaforths leading the assault. The latter battalion lost its
commander, Colonel Smith, but was the first into the objective, while the
Gordons held and consolidated the ground to the north of it. Farther north
still the 45th Brigade had advanced its whole line, while at the south flank of
the attack the 91st French Infantry was clearing the woods in front of it. The
machine-gun fire at this point was very heavy, however, and the French, after a
gallant struggle, were forced back to their original line, with the result that
the right of the attack was in the air. The Seaforths had carried the
Ch&acirc;teau of Buzancy as well as the village, and the orders were at all
costs to hold on to these important points; so part of the 4/5th Black Watch
was pushed forward to strengthen the defenders, who were hard pressed and
heavily gassed. There was desperate fighting all round the village, which was
declared by a veteran French flammenwerfer section attached to the Highlanders
to be the most bloody work seen by them in the war. With their flank naked the
remains of the brave battalions were exposed about six o'clock in the evening
to an overpowering German counter-attack which rolled up from the south-east
and drove them, still fighting tooth and claw, through the village, from which
six German officers and 200 men were brought as prisoners. Thus by seven in the
evening the 44th Brigade, after their day of most heroic effort, were back on
their original line. It was a sad end to a splendid deed of arms, but there was
no disposition to blame the Eighty-seventh French Division on the right, who
were already worn with much fighting, and who were faced with very difficult
country. Many of the Highlanders wept bitter tears of rage and mortification
when they found that the deaths of so many of their comrades had not bought the
village for which they gave their blood so willingly.</p>
<p>Orders were now received from the French Corps that the Scots Fifteenth
Division should change place with its neighbour, the Eighty-seventh French
Division, a difficult operation which was successfully accomplished, the
artillery in each case being left in position. The new operation was to consist
of an attack upon Hartennes Forest, the Twelfth French Division working round
the south and the Fifteenth Scots Division round the north end of it, both
meeting to the east, with Droisy as an ultimate objective. The attacking troops
were concealed so far as possible in the cornfields on July 31, and went
forward about eight o'clock in the morning of August 1, after the completion of
a successful French advance further down the line. The brunt of this new
advance was borne by the 6th Camerons and 13th Royal Scots of the 45th Brigade
(Orr-Ewing), together with the 10th Scots Rifles and 7/8th Scottish Borderers
of the 46th Brigade (Fortune). The left of the line made fine progress and
reached the east side of the Soissons Road, but the 45th Brigade on the right
was held up by terrible machine-gun fire, part of which came from several
derelict French tanks. These were dealt with and blown to pieces by trench
mortars. The advance was then resumed, the French Twelfth Division coming
forward also in the south. About midday the Camerons had reached their mark but
were out of touch with the Borderers on their right, so that they were
compelled to form a defensive flank from the cemetery to the road. The Germans
lay in a series of wooded hills upon the right, and though these were smothered
with shells the brave machine-gunners still clung to their position. So heavy
was their fire that the right flank could get no farther, and it was determined
to hold on to the ground gained. During the night the 44th Brigade, in spite of
its heavy losses three days before, took the place of the 46th.</p>
<p>It was evident on the morning of August 2 that the stern combat of the
previous day had not been without its effect. The enemy was retreating all
along the line, and his positions were being rapidly evacuated. The Twelfth
French Division on the right was able to advance almost without opposition past
the Hartennes Wood. There followed an exhilarating pursuit up to the banks of
the Crise River. The 9th Gordon Pioneer Battalion pushed in with great dash,
and was in Villeblain before evening, while the French Eighty-seventh Division
reached the river east of Buzancy. The Fifteenth Division was then relieved by
the Seventeenth French Division, and was restored to the First British Army
amid a shower of congratulatory messages from French Generals and comrades. So
deep was the feeling among the French over the magnificent fighting and heavy
losses of the Scots Division that a monument was at once raised in their honour
in front of the old German position with the inscription: <i>"Ici fleurira
toujours le glorieux Chardon d'&Eacute;cosse parmi les Roses de France."</i>
Many brave Scots will lie for ever round this monument. Three splendid
battalion commanders, Smith of the Gordons, Turner of the Royal Scots, and
Kennedy of the Seaforths, were slain, while Hart of the Scots Borderers and
Macleod of the Camerons were incapacitated&mdash;five Colonels out of ten
battalions. The sufferings from gas were very severe, and all the Brigade
Headquarters were severely affected, General Thomson and his staff holding on
for the duration of the battle, but collapsing on the evening of August 2.</p>
<p>Whilst the Fifteenth Division had been performing this notable service the
Thirty-fourth British Division (Nicholson) had also been incorporated for the
moment into Mangin's Fifteenth Army, and was heavily engaged in the battle line
opposite Grand Rozoy, rather south of the point where the Scots were
fighting.</p>
<p>So great had been the losses of this splendid Tyneside division in the
terrible contests of the Somme and of Flanders that it was now entirely
reconstituted with nothing of its previous personnel save its veteran commander
and a handful of war-worn officers. The infantry were mostly Territorials from
the Palestine campaign. On July 18 the Thirty-fourth became part of the Tenth
French Army near Senlis. On the 22nd it was incorporated into General Penet's
Thirtieth Corps, and relieved the French Thirty-eighth Division in the battle
zone, on a line parallel to the Ch&acirc;teau-Thierry&mdash;Soissons Road,
having its right just west of Coutremain and its left in Parcy Tigny.
Woodcock's 101st Brigade was on the right, Williams' 102nd on the left, while
Chaplin's 103rd Brigade was in support. French divisions, the Nineteenth and
the Fifty-eighth, were on either side, so that Nicholson's men formed a curious
isolated little bit of fighting England.</p>
<p>At 6 a.m. on the morning of July 25 the whole line in this section attacked
with the intention of carrying the important road already mentioned from
Ch&acirc;teau-Thierry to Soissons. It was a hard and disappointing day, for the
French divisions on either side were held by the heavy fire from the Bois de
Plessier and Tigny. The 101st Brigade was not more successful, but the 102nd on
the left got forward nearly a mile, and then lay with its left flank thrown
back to connect up with its French neighbours. Considering that it was the
first experience which these men had had of German artillery and machine-guns,
General Nicholson was well satisfied with his new material.</p>
<p>On July 27 the division was relieved by the extension of the flanks of its
two neighbours, but it was at once fitted into the line again, filling a
battle-front of 1500 yards, with its right east of Oulchy-le-Ch&acirc;teau. It
was just in time for an attack which opened at 5 a.m. on July 29, and it was
only by great exertions that the guns were registered and the infantry in their
places. The objective was a horse-shoe ridge from Beugneux in the east to Grand
Rozoy in the west. The 103rd Brigade was on the right, the 101st upon the
left.</p>
<p>The barrage was not as deadly as usual on account of the pressure of time
which had hampered the preparation and registration. The slopes were long and
open, swept by the deadly machine-guns. It was all odds against the attack. The
103rd Brigade got to the outskirts of Beugneux, but was held up by the
murderous fire from an adjacent mill. The 101st surmounted the ridge between
Grand Rozoy and Beugneux, but could get no farther, for it was all open ground
to the north.</p>
<p>In the early afternoon the 102nd Brigade advanced from the wood in which it
lay with the intention of helping the 101st to storm Beugneux, but as it came
forward it met the 101st falling back before a strong counter-attack. This
movement was checked by the new-comers and the line was sustained upon the
ridge.</p>
<p>The net result of an arduous day was that the division was still short of
the coveted road, but that it had won about 2000 yards of ground, including a
good position for future operations. Casualties were heavy, and included
Colonel Jourdain of the 2nd North Lancashires as well as Captain Weeks, CO. of
the 4th Royal Sussex. The French had got Grand Rozoy upon the left flank, and
though they were driven out of it again they won their way back in the early
morning of July 30. All this day and the next the troops prepared for a new
effort, lying under heavy shell-fire which, among other casualties, killed
Colonel Dooner, the chief staff officer of the division.</p>
<p>On August 1 the attack was renewed under a very heavy and efficient barrage,
which helped the infantry so much that within two hours all objectives had been
won. Beugneux fell after the hill which commanded it had been stormed by the
8th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in a very gallant advance. Colonel Barbow
fell while leading his men to victory. On the left the French Twenty-fifth
Division had been held up by the deadly fire from a knoll, but Major Atkinson
of the 2nd North Lancashires realised the situation and diverted his reserve
company to storm the obstacle, enabling the French right to get forward. It was
planned that two British battalions should push on beyond their objectives in
order to cover the flanks of a further French advance. One of these, the 4th
Cheshires, carried out its part to perfection in spite of heavy losses, which
included Colonel Swindells, its commander. The 1st Herefords, however, whose
r&ocirc;le was to cover the left of the Sixty-eighth French Division, was
unable to do so, as that division was itself held up. That night the enemy was
in full retreat all along this line, and falling back upon the River Vesle. On
August 3 the Thirty-fourth Division was returned to the area of the Second
British Army, having done a fine spell of service which brought the warmest
compliments from the French commanders, not only to the infantry, but to
General Walthall's guns (152nd and 160th Brigades) as well as Colonel Dobson's
207th, 208th, and 209th Field Companies.</p>
<p>The northward advance of the French, Americans, and British was slow up to
the end of July, but became accelerated in the first week of August, Soissons
falling to the French on August 2, and the Germans being driven to the line of
the Vesle, when they held on very tenaciously for a time, their rearguards
showing their usual high soldierly qualities. The Americans had a particularly
hard struggle, being faced by some of the elite of the German Army, including
the 4th Prussian Guards, but winning their way steadily forward in spite of
many strong counter-attacks. The situation upon the Vesle and the Aisne seemed
for the moment to have reached an equilibrium, when Marshal Foch called Marshal
Haig to his assistance and a new attack was launched in which British troops
were once more employed on the grand scale. Their great march had started which
was to end only at the bank of the Rhine.</p>
<p>Before embarking upon this narrative, it would be well to prevent the
necessity of interrupting it by casting a glance at those general events
connected with the world war which occurred during this period, which reacted
upon the Western front. It has already been shortly stated that the Austrian
Army had been held in their attempt to cross the Piave in mid June, and by the
end of the month had been driven over the river by the Italians, aided by a
strong British and French contingent. The final losses of the Austrians in this
heavy defeat were not less than 20,000 prisoners with many guns. From this time
until the final Austrian d&eacute;b&acirc;cle there was no severe fighting upon
this front. In the Salonican campaign the Greek Army was becoming more and more
a factor to be reckoned with, and the deposition of the treacherous
Constantine, with the return to power of Venizelos, consolidated the position
of the Allies. There was no decided movement, however, upon this front until
later in the year. In Palestine and in Mesopotamia the British forces were also
quiescent, Allenby covering the northern approaches of Jerusalem, and preparing
for his last splendid and annihilating advance, while Marshall remained in a
similar position to the north of Bagdad. A small and very spirited expedition
sent out by the latter will no doubt have a history of its own, for it was
adventurous to a degree which was almost quixotic, and yet justified itself by
its results. This was the advance of a handful of men over 700 miles of desert
separating the Bagdad front from the Caspian. Arriving at the town of Baku they
kept the German-Turks out of that town for six weeks at a time when oil
supplies were a most pressing problem for them, and so influenced the course of
the war. Finally they withdrew in safety after a most remarkable exploit,
hardly realised amid the clash of greater forces. Russia still remained in its
distracted condition, hag-ridden by forces which at their worst surpassed all
the classical excesses of the French Revolution. Regeneration began to appear
out of chaos, however, though the end was still afar. Allied forces in Siberia
and on the Murman Coast formed nuclei upon which the supporters of civilisation
could rally. On the water the atrocities of the German submarines and their
sinking of hospital ships, accompanied in several cases by the drowning of the
sick and wounded men, were the outstanding feature. In the main, therefore, it
can be said that there was a hush upon the periphery, while in the centre the
Allies with concentrated energy hurled themselves upon their enemy with the
fixed determination to have done with the thing for ever, fighting without a
break until either they could fight no more or the German menace had passed
from the world which it had overshadowed so long. Nowhere was there a thought
of compromise. There could be no justice unless it were thorough justice. The
criminal methods by which the war had been waged forbade every thought of an
incomplete settlement. With stern and deliberate determination the French and
British turned to their task, strengthened by the knowledge that the vanguard
of America was already in the field, weak as yet in numbers, but the head of
that long column which extended across the Atlantic and was based upon the
virile nation of a hundred million souls beyond.</p>

The Battle of Amiens, August 8&mdash;22</h2>
<p class="chaphead">Great British victory&mdash;Advance of the
Canadians&mdash;Of the Australians&mdash;Of the Third Corps&mdash;Hard struggle
at Chipilly&mdash;American assistance&mdash; Continuance of the
operations&mdash;Great importance of the battle</p>
<p class="first">IN the tremendous and decisive operations which we are now
about to examine, it is very necessary to have some fixed scheme in the method
of description s lest the reader be inextricably lost in the long line of
advancing corps and armies. A chapter will be devoted, therefore, to the attack
made by Rawlinson's Fourth Army whilst it was operating alone from August 8 to
August 22. At that date Byng's Third Army joined in the fray, and subsequently,
on August 28, Horne's First Army came into action. For the present, however, we
can devote ourselves whole-heartedly to the record of Rawlinson's Army, all the
rest being inactive. When the others come in, that is, after August 22, a
definite system of narrative will be adopted.</p>
<p>Before describing the great battle some reference should be made to the
action of Le Hamel fought on July 4, noticeable as having been the first Allied
offensive since the early spring. Its complete success, after the long series
of troubles which had plunged all friends of freedom into gloom, made it more
important than the numbers engaged or the gain of ground would indicate. It was
carried out by the Australian Corps, acting as part of the Fourth Army, and is
noticeable because a unit from the Thirty-third American Division took part in
the operations. Le Hamel was taken and the Vaire Wood to the immediate south of
the Somme. The gain of ground was about a mile in depth on a front of several
miles, and the advance was so swift that a considerable number of prisoners,
1500 in all, were taken, many of them still encumbered by their gas-masks. Some
sixty tanks took part in the advance, and did splendid work in rolling out the
machine-gun nests of the Germans. Si John Monash has attributed some of the
splendid efficiency of the Australian arrangements and their cunning in the
mutual support of guns, tanks, and infantry, so often to be shown in the next
four months, to the experience gained in this small battle.</p>
<p>The front of the new and most important attack, which began in the early
morning of August 8, was fifteen miles in length, and extended from near
Morlancourt in the north to Braches upon the Avre River to the south. The right
of the attack from Hangard onwards was formed by General Debeney's First French
Army, while General Rawlinson's Fourth Army formed the left, the British
position being roughly three-fourths of the whole. The entire battle was under
the command of Marshal Haig.</p>
<p>The preparations had been made with the skill which the British Command has
so often shown in such operations, so that the Germans were swept off their
feet by an attack which came upon them as a complete surprise. It was half-past
four on a misty morning when the enemy's advanced line heard the sudden crash
of the gun-fire, and a moment later saw the monstrous forms of the tanks
looming up through the grey light of dawn. Behind the tanks and almost in touch
of them came the grim war-worn infantry. Everything went down before that
united rush. The battle was won as soon as begun. The only question was how
great the success would be.</p>
<p>Taking a bird's-eye view of the advance, before examining the operations
more closely, one may say that the Canadian Corps, now under a Canadian
commander, General Currie, was on the extreme right of the British fine, in
touch with the French. Next to them, in the Morlancourt district, where they
had never ceased for the last four months to improve their position and to
elbow the invaders away from Amiens, were the indomitable and tireless
Australians under General Monash. On their left, just south of Albert, was
Butler's Third Corps, burning to avenge itself for the hustling which it had
endured during that perilous and heroic week in March. These were the three
units concerned in the new advance.</p>
<p>The opening barrage, though only a few minutes in length, was of a
shattering severity, and was directed against very different defences from
those which had defied the Army two years before upon the Somme. Everything
flattened out before it, and even the German guns seemed to have been
overwhelmed, for their reply was slow and ineffective. Only the machine-guns
remained noxious, but the tanks rolled them down. Nowhere at first was there
any check or delay. The French on the right of the line had done equally well,
and by midday were storming forward upon the north bank of the Avre, their
victory being the more difficult and honourable because the river prevented the
use of tanks at the first attack.</p>
<p>The Canadians were on the top of their form that day, and their magnificent
condition gave promise of the splendid work which they were to do from that
hour until almost the last day of the war. They were probably the most powerful
and efficient corps at that moment in the whole Army, for they had lain in
front of Lens with few losses, while nearly every other corps had been
desperately engaged and sustained heavy casualties, hastily made good by
recruits. They had also kept their brigades up to a four battalion standard,
and their divisions had that advantage of permanence denied to all British
corps. When to these favouring points are added the great hardihood and valour
of the men, proved in so many battles, it is probable that in the whole world
no finer body could on that day have been let loose behind a barrage. They were
weary from long marches before the battle began, but none the less their great
spirit rose high above all physical weakness as they pushed forward against the
German line.</p>
<p>They were faced at the outset by a problem which might well have taxed the
brains of any staff and the valour of any soldiers. This was the crossing of
the River Luce, which was covered upon the farther bank by several scattered
woods, ideal haunts of machine-guns. So difficult was this operation that the
French to the south had to pause for an hour after the capture of the front
German line, to give time for it to be carried out. At the end of that period
the very complex operation had been carried through, and the whole Allied front
was ready to advance. The Canadians had three divisions in the line, the Third
(Lipsett) next to the French, the First (Macdonell) in the middle, and the
Second (Benstall) on the left. The 2nd and 3rd British Cavalry Brigades with
the Fourth Canadian Infantry Division (Watson) were in reserve. There was also
a mobile force, called the Canadian Independent Force, which was kept ready to
take advantage of any opening. This consisted of the 1st and 2nd Canadian Motor
Machine-gun Brigades, with the Corps Cyclists, and some movable trench mortars
on lorries.</p>
<p>The width of the Canadian attack was some 5000 yards from the
Amiens&mdash;Roye Road to the Villers-Bretonneux Railway. Once across the river
the whole line came away with a grand rush and every objective was soon
attained, each division sweeping forward without a check. The prisoners
reported that an attack had indeed been expected, but not so soon, and we can
readily believe that the German Army, which had been so repeatedly assured that
the British were finally dead and out of the war, must have been greatly amazed
by this vigorous resurrection. By 10.40, Caix, which is a good five miles to
the eastward, was reported by contact aeroplanes to be surrounded by tanks. The
Cavalry and the Independent Force were both pushing to the front, and the
latter deviated to the right in order to help the French who were temporarily
in difficulties near Mezi&egrave;res. In the afternoon the Cavalry Division had
passed through the victorious and cheering lines of the Second Canadians, and
were carrying out a number of spirited enterprises upon the German supporting
lines. About the same time the Fourth Canadian Infantry Division pushed forward
and was reported to the east of Beaufort and Cayeux. By evening all along the
line the full objectives had been reached save at one point near Le Quesnel. In
their splendid day's work men of the Dominion had taken some 5000 prisoners and
great quantities of booty. Many of the prisoners and guns were taken by the
cavalry, who had their best day in the war. "The best hunt we ever had, forty
minutes and a kill in the open," was the characteristic description of one
hard-riding dragoon.</p>
<p>We shall now turn to the advance of Monash's Australians in the centre of
the British line. Fate owed Monash a great victory in this sector, for, during
months of quiet but ceaseless work, he had been improving his position as the
keen runner ensures his foothold and crouches his body while he awaits the
crack of the pistol.</p>
<p>For once Fate paid its debts, and with such a corps under his hand it would
have been strange had it not been so. All those advantages already described in
the case of the Canadians applied equally to the Australians, and if the former
outlasted the others, it must be remembered that the Australians had been in
the line for four months before the fighting began&mdash;months which included
the severe action of Villers-Bretonneux. They were a grand corps, and they did
grand work for the Empire&mdash;work which we can never forget so long as our
common history endures.</p>
<p>The order of battle of the Australian Corps on August 8 was that the Second
Division (Smyth) was on the right in touch with the Canadians, while the Third
Division (Gillibrand) was on the left in touch with the Fifty-eighth British
Division, the Somme being the dividing line between them. Behind the Second
Australians was the Fifth (Hobbs), and behind; the Third the Fourth (Maclagan),
with orders in each case to leapfrog over their leaders when the first
objectives were carried. The First Division (Glasgow) was in the immediate
rear. Thus at least 50,000 glorious infantry marched to battle under the
Southern Cross Union Jack upon this most historic day&mdash;a day which, as
Ludendorfi has since confessed, gave the first fatal shock to the military
power of Germany.</p>
<p>All depended upon surprise, and the crouching troops waited most impatiently
for the zero hour, expecting every instant to hear the crash of the enemy's
guns and the whine of the shrapnel above the assembly trenches. Every
precaution had been taken the day before, the roads had been deserted by all
traffic, and aeroplanes had flown low during the night, so that their droning
might cover the noise of the assembling tanks. Some misgiving was caused by the
fact that a sergeant who knew all about it had been captured several days
before. By a curious chance the minutes of his cross-examination by the German
intelligence officer were captured during the battle. He had faced his ordeal
like a Spartan, and had said no word. It is not often that the success of a
world-shaking battle depends upon the nerve and the tongue of a single
soldier.</p>
<p>Zero hour arrived without a sign, and in an instant barrage tanks, and
infantry all burst forth together, though the morning mist was so thick that
one could only see twenty or thirty yards. Everywhere the enemy front posts
went down with hardly a struggle. It was an absolute surprise. Now and then, as
the long, loose lines of men pushed through the mist, there would come the
flash of a field-piece, or the sudden burst of a machine-gun from their front;
but in an instant, with the coolness born of long practice, the men would run
crouching forward, and then quickly-close in from every side, shooting or
bayoneting the gun crew. Everything went splendidly from the first, and the
tanks did excellent service, especially in the capture of Warfusee.</p>
<p>The task of the two relieving divisions, the Fourth on the left and the
Fifth on the right, was rather more difficult, as the Germans had begun to
rally and the fog to lift. The Fourth Australians on the south bank of the
Somme were especially troubled, as it soon became evident that the British
attack on the north bank had been held up, with the result that the German guns
on Chipilly Spur were all free to fire across from their high position upon the
Australians in the plain to the south. Tank after tank and gun after gun were
knocked out by direct hits, but the infantry was not to be stopped and
continued to skirmish forward as best they might under so deadly a fire,
finishing by the capture of Cerisy and of Morcourt. The Fifth Division on the
right, with the 8th and 15th Brigades in front, made an equally fine advance,
covering a good stretch of ground.</p>
<p>Having considered the Canadians and the Australians, we turn now to the
Third Corps on the north of the line. They were extended from Morlancourt to
the north bank of the Somme, which is a broad canalised river over all this
portion of its course. On the right was the Fifty-eighth London Division
(Ramsay), with Lee's Eighteenth Division to the north of it, extending close to
the Ancre, where Higginson's Twelfth Division lay astride of that marshy
stream. North of this again was the Forty-seventh Division (Gorringe), together
with a brigade of the Thirty-third American Division. Two days before the great
advance, on August 6, the Twenty-seventh W&uuml;rtemburg Division had made a
sudden strong local attack astride of the Bray&mdash;Corbie Road, and had
driven in the Eighteenth Divisional front, taking some hundreds of prisoners,
though the British counter-attack regained most of the lost ground on the same
and the following days. This unexpected episode somewhat deranged the details
of the great attack, but the Eighteenth played its part manfully none the less,
substituting the 36th Brigade of the Twelfth Division for the 54th Brigade,
which had been considerably knocked about. None of the British prisoners taken
seem to have given away the news of the coming advance, but it is probable that
the sudden attack of the W&uuml;rtemburgers showed that it was suspected, and
was intended to anticipate and to derange it.</p>
<p>In the first phase of the attack the little village of Sailly-Laurette on
the north bank of the Somme was carried by assault by the 2/10th Londons. At
the same moment the 174th Brigade attacked Malard Wood to the left of the
village. There was a difficulty in mopping up the wood, for small German posts
held on with great tenacity, but by 9 o'clock the position was cleared. The
173rd Brigade now went forward upon the really terrible task of getting up the
slopes of Chipilly Hill under the German fire. The present chronicler has
looked down upon the line of advance from the position of the German
machine-guns and can testify that the affair was indeed as arduous as could be
imagined. The village of Chipilly was not cleared, and the attack, after
several very-gallant attempts, was at a stand. Meantime the 53rd Brigade on the
left had got about half-way to its objective and held the ground gained, but
could get no farther in face of the withering fire. Farther north, however, the
Twelfth Division, moving forward upon the northern slopes of the Ancre, had
gained its full objectives, the idea being that a similar advance to the south
would pinch out the village of Morlancourt. There was a time in the attack when
it appeared as if the hold-up of the Eighteenth Division would prevent
Vincent's 35th Brigade, on the right of the Twelfth Division, from getting
forward, but the situation was restored by a fine bit of work by the 1st
Cambridgeshires, who, under Colonel Saint, renewed the attack in a most
determined way and finally were left with only 200 men standing, but with 316
German prisoners as well as their objective. A wandering tank contributed
greatly to this success.</p>
<p>The partial nature of the local victory was due not only to the excellent
German dispositions and resistance, but to some want of liaison between tanks
and infantry, as well as to the total disability of the flying service to
furnish any reports before 12 o'clock. This want was partly made good by the
excellent scouting of the Northumberland Hussars. The remainder of the day was
spent in clearing the ground gained and holding a series of counter-attacks,
one of which drove back an advanced line of the 53rd Brigade.</p>
<p>Summing up, then, the result of the first day's fighting, it may be briefly
said that seven German Divisions had been cut to pieces, that 10,000 prisoners
and 200 guns had been counted, and that an advance had been made which in the
French sector reached Beaufort, and laid the British line well up to Caix,
Framerville, and Chipilly. To those who associated those village names with the
dark days when the Fifth Army, exhausted and decimated, was compelled to
retreat through them, it was indeed an added joy that they should be the
milestones of victory. The whole penetration, though not more than three miles
north of the Somme, was seven or eight miles at the deepest point, which is the
greatest ever yet attained on the first day of any Allied attack.</p>
<p>The battle was vigorously renewed on the morning of August 9, and once more
the tide flowed eastwards, carrying the average depth of progress two or three
miles farther. In the south the French directed their general advance rather to
the right and reached Arvillers as their final point. Their take of prisoners
had amounted altogether to 4000, and their depth of advance was over eight
miles. To their north the Canadians had reached Rosi&egrave;res, and the
Australians Rainecourt and Morcourt. To the north of the Somme the Third Corps
had been temporarily hung up by the very vigorous German resistance in a strong
position between Chipilly and Morlancourt. Before evening General Rawlinson was
able to report the capture of a total for the two days of 17,000 prisoners and
250 guns.</p>
<p>To take the events of this second day of battle in closer detail, the
Canadians resumed their attack at 10 a.m. with the same order of divisions in
the line, but with their Fourth Division acting with the Independent Force upon
the right, where in the early morning it captured Le Quesnel. There was heavy
fighting all day along the Corps front, but the advance was pushed forward for
another 2500 yards. Many villages were contained in this area, the Third
Canadians on the right getting Folies and Bouchoir, the Second Canadians on the
left Vrely, Rosi&egrave;res, and Meharicourt, while the First Canadians in the
centre got Warvillers, Beaufort, and Rouvroy. The Germans had rushed up their
anti-tank guns, and the casualties were heavy that day, especially near Le
Quesnel, where many tanks were destroyed by direct hits from concealed
batteries. To make a complete and connected narrative of the doings upon this
front it may here be added that on August 10 the resistance thickened and the
advance slowed. Le Quesnel was taken early by the Third Canadians, upon which
the Thirty-second British Division passed through their ranks and carried the
advance on to the outskirts of Parvillers and Damery. The Fourth Canadian
Division in turn had very stubborn fighting and considerable losses, but it
ended the day in possession of Fouquescourt, Maucourt, Chilly, and Hallu. At
night, great fires reddening the whole eastern sky gave promise of a further
German retreat. On August it was clear, however, that no further important
advance could be made without fresh preparation, and orders were given for
consolidation. A French attack on the right on Bois en Z had no success, nor
was the Thirty-second Division able to take Damery. Instead of advance it was
rather a day of strong counter-attacks, against which the attenuated lines,
after three days of battle, were hard put to it to hold their own, a flank fire
from Lihons helping the German attack at Hallu and Chilly. The line was in the
main held, however, and a total take of 8000 prisoners was in the Canadian
cages that evening, while 167 guns had been taken by the one Corps. We shall
now turn back and follow the fortunes of the Australians on the second and
third days of the battle.</p>
<p>Upon August 9 General Monash's Corps still carried forward its victorious
career, though a halt was called for the Fourth Division on the left which
awaited developments upon the north bank of the river. On the right the Second
Division passed through the Fifth in order to continue the advance, while the
First Division thrust itself in upon the right flank, next to the Canadians.
Progress was slower everywhere, but none the less it was substantial,
Framerville being taken by the 7th Brigade. There was a misunderstanding about
time, with the result that the First Division advanced some hours before their
Canadian neighbours, with tragic consequences to their own right flank, formed
by the 2nd Brigade. The advance was over open country, with the Lihons ridge
and village in front, from which heavy gun-fire played upon the attack and
caused considerable losses, while on the right a deadly fire was maintained
from Rosi&egrave;res Station. So heavy were the casualties in the First and
Second Divisions that reinforcements had to be sent up when the advance was
resumed. In the evening some relief was obtained, for the region of the old
French trenches was reached and the men were at last able to get some cover.
Many of the Australians who fought through this long hot day had marched for
five hours in order to reach the field of battle, so that it was a remarkable
test of endurance Finally Crepy and Crepy Wood were taken and held against
three severe counter-attacks which broke upon them next day. On August Lihons
Ridge fell and the village was occupied by the 2nd Brigade, which again had to
face determined attacks. The Germans fully appreciated the vital worth of this
position, which commanded the plain both to west and east, so they strained
every nerve first to hold and afterwards to recover it, but it was in stronger
hands than theirs. The 3rd Brigade on the left of Lihons was particularly
heavily attacked but threw back its assailants in confusion. Every yard gained
was held. A final very serious German counter-attack in successive waves, with
400 in a wave, drove down from Lihu Wood in the north-east and actually
penetrated the front Australian lines, but the 8th Battalion in support threw
itself into the fight and soon the position had been completely restored.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Fourth Australian Division had been released by the
fact that the remains of the Fifty-eighth Division and the 131st American
Infantry Regiment had, as will be told, cleared the Chipilly Ridge north of the
river. Part of the Fourth Australians had crossed the river, fraternising
greatly with the Americans, so that the officers on both sides had some trouble
in sorting out their men&mdash;the more so as the comradeship had often taken
the form of an exchange of hats and coats. On the night of August 10 the whole
of the Fourth Australians had crossed to the north bank of the Somme near
Sailly-le-Sec, and their commander, General Maclagan, had taken under him the
Americans and also the 173rd and 174th Brigades of the British Fifty-eighth
Division, much the worse for wear.</p>
<p>The Third Australian Division had taken the place south of the Somme vacated
by their fellow-countrymen, and on the morning of August they continued the
attack in the direction of Proyart, that village being eventually carried by
the 10th Brigade. It is needless to say that books might, and probably will, be
written as to individual adventures and deeds of heroism, which in their
aggregate supplied the driving force which carried the line ever more and more
to the eastward. In giving a condensed account of the effects one can hardly
get down to the more human story of the causes. Yet few greater deeds of valour
can have been anywhere done than that of Sergeant Statton of the 40th
Battalion, who in this engagement of Proyart seeing a neighbouring battalion,
the 37th, held up by a nest of machine- guns, ran across to their aid, shot all
the gunners at one gun, captured three guns single-handed, and chased the crews
from two others. Many a battalion has spent itself in doing less.</p>
<p>We shall now turn to the British Third Corps on the north of the Somme and
so complete the account of the attack of the Fourth Army. It will be remembered
that on the evening of August 8 they had made headway along the whole line but
had been held up on the Chipilly Spur.</p>
<p>The attack upon Chipilly was renewed at 4.15 next afternoon, the delay being
caused by the need of assembling the reserves, which consisted of the remainder
of the Fifty-eighth Division and of the 131st Regiment of the Thirty-third
Division (Bell) of he United States Army. The assault was made by the 6th and
2/10th London Battalions, but they were opportunely and very efficiently aided
by two companies of the Americans, who had lost their direction for the main
attack planned to the north, but who seemed indifferent which fight they were
in so long as they were fighting. There was a check at the outset, but the
attack, while demonstrating from the: west, really materialised from the north,
and both village and ridge were captured with a number of prisoners. This was a
very important little victory from the point of view of the Australians to the
south who had been commanded by the German guns from this elevated
position.</p>
<p>The main attack was north of the Chipilly Spur, and was planned to gain
Cressaire Wood and a line across from the Somme to the Ancre corresponding with
such an advance. The assault was made by two weak brigades of the Fifty-eighth
Londoners upon the right, the 131st American Regiment in the centre, and the
remains of the Fifty-eighth upon the left. Farther north the Twelfth Division,
with the 37th Brigade in front, carried on the line. Both Londoners and
Americans advanced with equal valour, and after a stiff fight the main portion
of the objectives was won, though it took three hours of hard work to win them.
Much credit was due to all, but most to the American infantry, who had their
first experience of modern fighting and who were naturally embarrassed by the
disappearance of two of their companies which had drifted into the Chipilly
affair. For a time there was a gap between divisions, but before evening the
Twelfth extended to the right and all was well. The correction was very
necessary, for at 3 a.m. on August 10 a German counter-attack broke without
effect upon this very point of junction. The Twelfth Division had had a very
good day on August 9, Incledon-Webber's 37th Brigade especially distinguishing
itself. The 6th Buffs and 6th West Kents had heavy losses, but took 350
prisoners, two field-guns, and a number of machine-guns. Two of these were
taken single-handed by Sergeant Harris of the West Kents, who met his death in
attacking a third. The Victoria Cross was his posthumous reward.</p>
<p>On August 10 the Third Corps front was pushed forward in the morning by a
system of infiltration, British and American patrols scouting and fighting
through the eastern portion of Cressaire Wood. Before evening, without any
serious fighting, they reached the old French Amiens defence line, which was
the original full objective upon this front. Having entirely accomplished his
arduous task General Butler, who had been handicapped by an illness which he
disregarded while his work called for his presence, took a short spell of rest,
his place being taken by General Godley. The Forty-seventh Division (Gorringe)
came across to the right wing, relieving the Eighteenth Division, while shortly
after the Thirty-third American Division, to the great regret of their British
comrades, entrained for the south to join the main American army, but not
before their 133rd Regiment, acting with the 13th Australian Brigade, had taken
Etinehem Spur, to the north of the River Somme. The action now died down in
this quarter. In the three days of fighting General Butler's Corps had taken 90
guns and 3000 prisoners, while, in the words of General Rawlinson, "in
protecting the left flank of the Fourth Army they were given a difficult task
which was carried out with a determination and gallantry beyond all praise "
The losses had been 6500, 500 of which were from the American Regiment. The
general result of the battle by the night of August was that the French had
taken 8000 and the British 21,000 prisoners with 400 guns, so that it was
already clear that the greatest victory which the British Army had yet won was
that which initiated the final advance. In spite of all this success it is to
be borne in mind, however, that the Allies had only reached the old German
front line trenches of 1916, which were now a valuable barrier for the rear of
the retreating army. There was a pause now while the Fourth Army was waiting
for their comrades of the Third Army on the left to develop their extension of
the attack. Meanwhile many small actions and local advances on Rawlinson's
front kept his opponents from having time to reorganise. On August 13, as
already mentioned, Americans and Australians advanced the line to the north of
the river along the strip which is bounded upon the left by the
Bray&mdash;Corbie Road. On August 14 the Canadian 7th Brigade took Parvillers
after some very stiff local fighting. They were driven out again that night by
the heavy concentration of the German artillery, but next morning, with the
cooperation upon their flank of their comrades of the 9th Brigade, they won it
once more. In this operation the 52nd Battalion took Damery, while the French
carried the wood to the south of the village. There was a strong counter-attack
in the afternoon by the German One hundred and twenty-first Division, but it
was beaten back, leaving a number of prisoners. About August 20 the Canadians
began to slip quietly out of the line, and were conveyed, unknown to the
Germans, to a new front where they came under the command of General Home of
the First Army. Their exploits upon this new stage will be described later. The
French were now on the immediate right of the Australians until the time came
for the advent of the British Ninth Corps.</p>
<p>Amid the tremendous events which followed each other in a stupendous
historical procession during the latter half of 1918 it is hard to select those
which were decisive from those which were merely great. It may safely be said,
however, that three dates stand out as great military crises&mdash;the turn of
the tide on July 18, the British advance on August 8, and the breaking of the
Hindenburg Line on September 29. It has been admitted by General Ludendorff
that it was the second of these which broke the confidence of the German Staff
and finally convinced them that the war must go against them. A very special
honour rests, therefore, with the three corps, British, Australian, and
Canadian, who brought about this victory, as well as to the tanks, the cavalry,
and the airmen who led or followed the victorious infantry and the masterful
guns during these days of doom.</p>

<h2><a id="chap3" name="chap3">III. CONTINUATION OF THE OPERATIONS OF
RAWLINSON'S FOURTH ARMY</a><br>
From August 22 to the Battle of the Hindenburg Line, September 29</h2>
<p class="chaphead">Further advance of the Australians&mdash;Of the Third
Corps&mdash;Capture of Albert &mdash;Advance across the old Somme
battlefield&mdash;Capture of Mont St. Quentin &mdash;Splendid Australian
exploit&mdash;Fall of Peronne&mdash;D&eacute;but of the Yeomanry
(Seventy-fourth) Division&mdash;Attack on the outliers of the Hindenburg Line
&mdash;Appearance of the Ninth Corps&mdash;Eve of the Judgment</p>
<p class="first">WE have now reached the date when Byng's Third Army joined in
the fray, and it is necessary to find some means of co-ordinating the narrative
and carrying it on in definite stages. The next well-marked crisis which
affects each of the armies engaged is the great general attack on September 29,
which broke the Hindenburg Line. Therefore, in separate chapters the operations
of each army will be brought up to that date, and then further chapters will
cover the doings of each up to the date of the Armistice. Since we have dealt
with the Fourth Army, we may as well continue with it now until we are in close
touch with the Hindenburg Line, premising only that instead of an inert
neighbour upon the left we have a very active advancing British Army. We shall
then go on to the Third and to the First Armies, and bring each of them in turn
up to the same point.</p>
<p>On August 22 and the following days, the Fourth Army, with only two
Corps&mdash;the Third and the Australians&mdash;in front, renewed its attack,
greatly strengthened by the movement of the Third Army on its left, which
ensured that at least five British corps were all moving forward together,
distributing the advance over so wide an area that the Germans were less able
to concentrate reserves of men or of guns at any one point&mdash;a result which
was much aided by the fine work of General Mangin's Army on the right.</p>
<p>The main part of the fighting on the front of the Fourth Army on August 22
was north of the Somme, where the Third Australian Division covered the right
flank of the Third Corps. On the south of the river the Australian Corps
advanced on a front of 4&frac12; miles, and took all their limited objectives,
which represented a depth of 1&frac12; miles. This was effected by the Fifth
Australian Division on the right and the Fourth on the left, supported and
finally supplanted by the First Australian and Lambert's Thirty-Second British
Divisions, the latter on the right. The advance, which began at dawn, was no
easy one, as the country was much cut about with many obstacles, seamed with
trenches, and dotted with scattered woods.</p>
<p>The determined infantry would take no denial, however, and Herleville,
Chuignies, and several other small village sites were captured. The heaviest
fighting was in the woods, but a skilful system of encircling points of danger
had been carefully worked out, and the losses were less than might have been
anticipated. Sixteen guns, 80 officers, and 2463 men were the trophies of the
day. Early in the morning of August 24 the Third Australian Division moved
suddenly forward north of the river, captured the town of Bray, and formed a
permanent line upon the further side. On August 25 this same unit advanced 3000
yards on a 4000-yard front with very little resistance, always covering the
right of the Third Corps.</p>
<p>Let us now follow the work of this Corps from August 22 onwards.</p>
<p>It covered the ground from Albert in the north, where it was working in
close liaison with the Welsh Division on the right of the Fifth Corps, down to
a point near the Somme where it was in touch with the Australians. The
immediate object of the operations was to eject the enemy from the positions in
and around Albert which he had held for four months, and also from his whole
defensive system opposite to the Amiens defence line, which latter had been
regained in the previous fighting. On the day of battle the Forty-seventh
London Division was on the right of the Corps line, the Twelfth Division in the
centre, and the Eighteenth Division on the left. To this last was confided the
difficult and important operation of clearing Albert, and of establishing light
bridges over the Ancre so as to cross that stream and attack the high ground
east of the town on the Becourt Road. There was to be no preliminary
bombardment, but machine-gun and artillery barrages were to cover the
infantry.</p>
<p>The zero hour was 4.45, and at the signal the Forty-seventh and Twelfth
Divisions advanced behind a creeping barrage, moving at the rate of 100 yards
in four minutes, and as thick as 250 field-guns could make it. With such a van
of destruction in front the infantry came forward without undue losses, though
a particular strong point named the Pear Tree just on the inter-divisional
boundary held fast and was destined to give trouble for several days to come.
As an observer remarked, "Anything British, from a helmet to a tank, which
showed over the crest was met by the sweeping fire of many machine-guns, while
shells from trench mortars fell in the ranks of men following up. It was only
when the general attack was continued that this hornet's nest could be
cleared." Save for this point the general objectives marked out for these
divisions, which meant an advance of between two and three miles, were
successfully made good, but an attempt to follow up with cavalry and whippet
tanks could not be persevered in, so stiff was the opposition. It was soon
found that the enemy in the Forty-seventh Division sector was not only capable
of defence, but of aggression, for about 4 in the afternoon his infantry
advanced in a strong attack with a powerful artillery backing, and drove with
such violence into the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th Londons, forming the 142nd Brigade,
that they were temporarily thrown back. Their right held firm, however, as did
the Third Australian Division to the south, so that no gap was formed. Being
reinforced by the 175th Brigade from the Fifty-eighth Division in reserve, the
Londoners soon reformed their ranks, greatly thinned both by their advance in
the morning and by the German onslaught in the afternoon. The enemy's front was
so menacing that the rest of the day and part of August 23 were spent in
reorganisation and consolidation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile on the left, Lee's Eighteenth Division, a famous all-English unit
of the type which, however brilliant its comrades, has always formed the solid
core of the magnificent tireless Imperial Army, was carrying out its difficult
task at Albert. It had two brigades in the line, the 54th to the south and the
55th to the north of the town. The Germans in front held the line of the Ancre,
with Albert as a bridgehead, the ruins and cellars of the town being sown with
snipers and machine-guns. To clear the town, to occupy the high ground to the
east, and by these operations to cover the flanks of two armies was the
function of this Division, and also to secure crossings at Albert by which the
Welsh on their left could get across.</p>
<p>The stream in this part was 6 feet deep and 14 wide, with swampy banks
strongly held by the enemy. There were unguarded bits, however, and patrols got
across on the 21st, which simplified the task, though it deranged at the last
moment all the preparations for barrage. Part of the 6th Northamptons and the
11th Royal Fusiliers crossed early on the 22nd and formed up along the edge of
the Albert&mdash;Meaulte Road, while the rest of the 6th Northamptons fought
hard for elbow-room on the right flank, working in close liaison with the 36th
Brigade on the left of the Twelfth Division who were attacking Meaulte. About 6
the whole front line advanced in this quarter, flooding over the scattered
German posts, and capturing eighty machine-guns with their crews. At the same
time the 8th East Surreys on the left had rushed Albert, and after some fine
confused fighting had cleared the ruins and taken the whole town, with the
river crossings. The 7th Buffs at once pushed out on the
Albert&mdash;Pozi&egrave;res road, but were held up by very heavy fire. The
11th Royal Fusiliers further south had also been held up by the guns on the
summit of Shamrock Hill, east of the town, but a company of the 2nd Bedfords,
led by Captain Doake, captured this strong point and the line went forward.
Altogether it was a good day's work, and save on the extreme left most of the
objects were attained at the cost of reasonable casualties, which included
General Sadleir-Jackson of the 54th Brigade, who was badly wounded in the leg.
The 53rd Brigade continued their advance up to 10 P.M., so as to gain the high
ground on the Becourt Road, and thus prepare for the next day's operations.</p>
<p>The 113th Brigade of the Welsh Division on the left had been passed over by
the Albert bridges, and the 53rd had also passed in the night. The plan of
August 23 was that these two brigades should attack Usna and Tara Hills
respectively, on the high ground to the west of Becourt Wood. The Usna attack
is described under the operations of the Fifth Corps. The Tara attack was
completely successful, and four tanks rendered conspicuous service. The work
was carried out by the 10th Essex, 7th West Kents, and the 7th Queen's from the
55th Brigade. It was a fine military feat, far more important than 350
prisoners would imply, for it broke the girdle round Albert and cleared the
road for the advance. No progress was made at the other portions of the corps
front on this date, save for some advance on the left of the Twelfth Division
near Meaulte.</p>
<p>It had been determined to keep up incessant pressure, and to test
Hindenburg's incautious maxim that the side with the best nerves would wear
down the other. At 1 A.M. on August 24 the whole line burst into flame once
more, and under a clear moon the Army rolled forward. On the right the
Forty-seventh Division had ample revenge for its temporary check, as its 140th,
together with the 175th Brigade of the Fifty-eighth Division, Londoners all,
swept across the debated land of the Happy Valley and secured it. The
Eighteenth Division also made good its objectives, the chief impediment being
the historical mine craters of 1916 at La Boiselle; 250 prisoners were taken
out of these by the 8th Royal Berks, a party of whom under Captain Nicholson,
covered by Captain Sutherst's 53rd Trench Mortar Battery, cleared up this
difficult point. In the morning the Eighteenth Division was well to the east of
Becourt. The only check was in the centre, where the general advance of the
Twelfth Division was still held up by that Pear Tree strong point which had
already caused so much trouble. Before evening, however, it was clear that the
enemy was effecting a general retreat, and the 37th Brigade was able to take
possession of this very well defended portion of the ridge.</p>
<p>It was clear now that the German front was crumbling, and the whole British
line was pushing ahead. The chief obstacle on the morning of August 25 came
from an all-pervading mist. There was no check, however, anywhere in the
advance up to 2 P.M., when the general line of the front was up to Mametz. The
hardest fighting of the day was done at Billon Wood by the 173rd Brigade, all
three battalions, the 2/2nd, 3rd, and 2/4th London, having real hard work, and
standing to it like men. The place was strongly held with powerful artillery
support, but it had been cleared before nightfall. By the same hour the Twelfth
Division was east of Mametz, and the 8th East Surreys were on the far side of
Mametz Wood. As these familiar places came once more into their possession the
troops felt that the tide had indeed turned. On August 26 the Eighteenth
Division had cleared the ruins of Montauban, and the Twelfth, Carnoy, while the
Fifty-eighth pushed on from Billon Wood, and wound up within a few hundred
yards of Maricourt. This village was passed the next day, and altogether, on
August 27 and 28, another three miles were added to the advance of the Twelfth
and Fifty-eighth Divisions, the progress never ceasing, but being continually
accompanied by fighting and maintained always against severe artillery fire.
The Germans had thrown in three fresh divisions upon this front and the
resistance was still very stiff.</p>
<p>This was especially evident at Trones Wood, which was carried for the second
time in this way by the Eighteenth Division on August 27. This fine assault was
made by the 8th Berks and 7th West Kents, who carried it out with both flanks
open to the enemy since the Welsh had been held in front of Delville. So heavy
were the losses that the Berkshires were in danger of not being strong enough
to hold what they had gained, so the 10th Essex were pushed into the fight. At
8 A.M. on August 27 a German Guards battalion drove through Trones Wood and
pushed out the British stormers, but they held on by their teeth to the eastern
edge of Bernafoy Wood. Here General Barker of the 53rd Brigade reorganised his
very weary ranks, which had been greatly mixed in the advance and retreat. Just
as evening was falling the remains of the gallant brigade darted forward once
more and came to grips with the Francis Joseph Prussian Guards, who lay with
many a machine-gun among the brushwood. Led by Colonel Banks of the 8th
Berkshires, the English infantry rushed into the wood and poured over the
German position, taking forty machine-guns and completely overcoming the
resistance. It was a fine exploit, and when the 53rd Brigade gave place to the
54th on the morning of August 28 they handed over to them the whole of this
terrible grove, which has been so drenched by the bravest blood of two great
nations. There was no further action in this quarter on August 28, but on the
29th the 54th Brigade, now under Colonel Perceval, was heavily engaged.
Guillemont was passed, though no trace of this large village could be
distinguished, and all day the 2nd Bedfords on the left and the 6th Northants
on the right were working forward across the grim old battlefield. On August 28
the Twelfth Division took Hardecourt, and General Higginson, who may well have
been disturbed by the constant flow of youngsters into his ranks to take the
place of his disabled veterans, must have had his fears removed and his heart
gladdened by the splendid conduct that day of 250 men of the 9th Royal
Fusiliers under Colonel Van Someren, none of whom had been in France more than
three weeks. On August 30 a great centre of German resistance was Priez Farm,
which held up the 11th Royal Fusiliers, and also the Forty-seventh Division
which had taken the place of the Twelfth in the centre of the corps. The enemy
was clinging hard to Morval, also in the Welsh area, and this made any advance
on the front of the Eighteenth Division impossible. It was clear that a regular
battle with artillery preparation was needed, and this was arranged for
September 1. The right wing of the corps had in the meantime got to the line of
Maurepas, and on August 31 the Forty-seventh Division in the centre made a good
advance up to Long Wood with a number of prisoners to show for it. The
Fifty-eighth Division closed in upon Marri&egrave;res Wood, which they took
after some heavy fighting, avenging the brave South Africans who had died so
gallantly there five months before. It was clear that the enemy were now
standing in a strong line, and were by no means beaten, which was shown also by
the bearing of the prisoners, whose morale was high, and who spoke with as much
pride and assurance as ever of the ultimate military success of their country.
Yet during the last week they had been steadily driven back some 3000 yards
every day by the remorseless barrage of the British guns followed by the
disciplined rush of the British infantry.</p>
<p>We shall now leave the Third Corps for a time at this line of fixed
resistance and return to consider the advance of the Australians to the south.
This had been victorious and unbroken, though no very serious resistance had to
be overcome. Smoke by day and fire by night, with explosions at all hours,
heralded the German retreat. On August 26 Cappy was occupied. On the 27th Vaux
Wood was occupied north of the river, while Foucaucourt and Vermandovillers
were submerged to the south, villages no longer, but at least marks of progress
upon the map. On the 28th the Germans were still retreating with the toes of
the Australians upon their very heels, but the heavier shelling warned General
Monash that there was a fixed line ahead, as might well be expected, since his
men were now nearing the point where the bend of the Somme brought the river
right across their front. Dompierre, Fay, Estr&eacute;es, and other old centres
of contention were taken that day. On the 29th the 3rd Australians got Hem,
while on the south the rest of the corps advanced 2000 yards to the bank of the
river, taking the whole line of villages from Biaches to Villers-Carbonnel. The
task of capturing such places was much complicated by the difficulty of knowing
where they were after you had got them. The present writer was in Carbonnel,
which was a considerable place, some weeks later, and was unable to find any
trace of habitation save a signboard upon which was printed the words: "Here
was the village of Villers-Carbonnel."</p>
<p>At the end of August the resistance had stiffened, and it was clear that the
Germans meant to take advantage of the unique situation of Peronne in order to
make it a strong centre of resistance. To the civilian observer it would have
seemed that such a place was impregnable against assault, for it is girt in
with reedy marshes on the west, and with a moat on the north, while the south
is defended by the broad river, even as in the days when Quentin Durward formed
part of the garrison. Yet the Australians took it in their stride by a mixture
of cleverness and valour which must have greatly rejoiced General Rawlinson,
who saw so formidable an obstacle removed from his path. As a preliminary
operation the Third Australian Division had taken Clery in the north, which
they held against a vigorous counter-attack on September 30. Halles was
afterwards captured. The question now was how to approach the town. Immediately
to the north of it there lies a formidable hill, well marked, though of no
great height. This place, which is called Mont St. Quentin, commanded all
approaches to the town as well as the town itself. The Germans had recognised
the importance of the position and had garrisoned it with picked troops with
many machine-guns. Standing upon its pitted crest, where one is often
ankle-deep in empty cartridges, one cannot imagine as one looks west how a
rabbit could get across unscathed. This was the formidable obstacle which now
faced the Australians.</p>
<p>They went at it without a pause and with characteristic earnestness and
directness, controlled by very skilful leadership. Two brigades, the 5th and
6th of Rosenthal's Second Australian Division, had been assembled on the north
of the Somme bend, the men passing in single file over hastily constructed
foot-bridges. By this means they had turned the impassable water defences which
lie on the westward side of Peronne, but they were faced by a terrible bit of
country, seamed with trenches, jagged with wire, and rising to the village of
St. Quentin, which is a little place on the flank of the hill. The hill itself
is crowned by a ragged wood some acres in extent. Mont St. Quentin lies about
equidistant, a mile or so, from Peronne in the south, and from the hamlet of
Feuillaucourt in the north. On this front of two miles the action was
fought.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of August 31 the 5th Brigade, under General Martin,
advanced upon the German position. The 17th Battalion was in the centre
opposite to Mont St. Quentin. The 19th was on the right covering the ground
between that stronghold and Peronne, the 20th on the left, extending up to
Feuillaucourt, with that village as one of its objectives. The 18th was in
close support. A very heavy and efficient artillery bombardment had prepared
the way for the infantry assault, but the defending troops were as good as any
which Germany possessed, and had endured the heavy fire with unshaken
fortitude, knowing that their turn would come.</p>
<p>From the moment that the infantry began to close in on the German positions
the battle became very bitter and the losses very serious. The 19th Battalion
on the right were scourged with fire from the old fortified walls of Peronne,
from St. Denis, a hamlet north of the town, and from scattered woods which
faced them. Every kind of missile, including pineapple-bombs and
rifle-grenades, poured down upon them. The long thin line carried on bravely,
halted, carried on once more, and finally sank down under such poor cover as
could be found, sending back a message that further artillery bombardment was a
necessity. On the left of the attack the 20th Battalion seems to have had a
less formidable line before it, and advancing with great speed and resolution,
it seized the village of Feuillaucourt. In the centre, however, a concentration
of fire beat upon the 17th Battalion, which was right under the guns of Mont
St. Quentin. Working on in little groups of men, waiting, watching, darting
forward, crouching down, crawling, so the scattered line gradually closed with
its enemy, presenting a supreme object lesson of that individual intelligence
and character which have made the Australian soldier what he is. A little after
7 o'clock in the morning the survivors of two companies drew together for the
final rush, and darted into the village of Mont St. Quentin, throwing out a
line of riflemen upon the far side of it. On that far side lay the culminating
slope of the hill crowned with the dark ragged trees, their trunks linked up
with abattis, laced with wire, and covering machine-guns. The place was still
full of Germans and they had strong reserves on the further side of the
hill.</p>
<p>The 17th had reached their goal, but their situation was very desperate.
Their right was bent back and was in precarious contact with the 19th
Battalion. Their left flank had lost all touch. They were a mere thin fringe of
men with nothing immediately behind them. Two companies of the supporting
battalion had already been sent up to stiffen the line of the 19th Battalion,
and the remaining two companies were now ordered forward to fill the gap
between the 17th and 20th. Not a rifle was left in reserve, and the whole
strength of the Brigade was in the firing-line. It was no time for hedging, for
everything was at stake.</p>
<p>But the pressure was too severe to last. The Australian line could not be
broken, but there comes a point when it must bend or perish. The German
pressure from the wood was ever heavier upon the thin ranks in front of it. A
rush of grey infantry came down the hill, with showers of bombs in front of
them. One of the companies in the village had lost every officer. The fire was
murderous. Guns firing over open sights had been brought up on the north of the
village, and were sending their shells through the ruined houses. Slowly the
Australians loosened their clutch upon their prize and fell back to the west of
the village, dropping down in the broken ground on the other side of the main
Peronne Road, and beating back five bombing attacks which had followed them up.
Still the fire was murderous, and the pressure very heavy, so that once more,
by twos and threes, the survivors fell back 250 yards west of the road, where
again they lay down, counting their dwindling cartridges, and dwelling upon
their aim, as the grey crouching figures came stealthily forward. The attack
was at an end. It had done splendidly, and it had failed. But the scattered
survivors of the 5th Brigade still held on with grim tenacity, certain that
their comrades behind would never let them down.</p>
<p>All night there was spasmodic fighting, the Germans pushing their
counter-attack until the two lines were interlocked and the leading groups of
the 5th Brigade were entirely cut off. In some places the more forward Germans
finding a blank space&mdash;and there were many&mdash;had pushed on until they
were 500 yards west of the general line of the 5th Brigade. Thus when
Robertson's 6th Brigade attacked at an early hour of September 1, they came on
German infantry posts before they connected up with the main line of their own
comrades. Their advance had been preceded by a crashing bombardment from
everything which would throw a projectile, so that the crest of the hill was
fairly swept with bullets and shells. Then forward went the line, the 23rd
Battalion on the right, the 24th on the left, 21st and 22nd in support. From
the start the fire was heavy, but all opposition was trampled down, until the
two leading battalions were abreast of the hill. Then once more that terrible
fire brought them to a halt. The 23rd on the right was held by the same
crossfire which had beaten upon the 19th the day before. Its losses were heavy.
The 24th got forward to Feuillaucourt and then, having occupied it, turned to
the right and endeavoured to work down to Mont St. Quentin from the north. But
the fire was too murderous and the advance was stopped. Other elements were
coming into action, however, which would prevent the whole German effort being
concentrated upon the defence of the one position. In the north the 10th
Brigade of the Third Australian Division, with the 229th British Yeomanry
Brigade upon their left, were swinging round and threatening to cut in on the
German flank and rear. In the south the 14th Australian Brigade of the Fifth
Division was advancing straight upon the town of Peronne, attacking from the
south and east simultaneously. But even now the nut was too hard for the
crackers. The British and the 10th Australian Brigades were fighting their way
round in the north and constant progress was being made in that indirect
pressure. But the 6th Brigade after its splendid advance was held up, and old
Peronne, spitting fire from its ancient walls, was still keeping the 14th
Brigade at a distance. At 8 o'clock the attack had again failed. Orders were
then given for the reorganisation of the troops and for a renewed effort at
half-past one. The artillery had been brought up and reinforced, so that it now
fairly scalped the hill. At the hour named the direct advance of the 6th
Brigade was resumed, the fresh 21st Battalion being pushed into the centre,
between the 23rd and 24th which had both suffered severely in the morning. This
time General Rosenthal was justified of his perseverance. At the signal the
troops poured forward and under a hail of bullets seized the ruins of the
village once more, streaming out at the further side and falling into a long
skirmish line on the western edge of the wood. The brave German defenders were
still unabashed and the losses were so heavy that the wood could not instantly
be carried, but the position was consolidated and held, with the absolute
certainty that such close grips in front with the threatening movements upon
his flank must drive him from the hill. So it proved, for when on the morning
of September 2 the 7th Brigade passed over the fatal plain, which was sown with
the bodies of their comrades, they went through the village and on past the
wood with little opposition, forming up at last in a defensive line facing
south-east, while the Fifth Division on the south drove home its attack upon
Peronne, where the defence was already hopelessly compromised by the various
movements to the north.</p>
<p>Thus fell Mont St. Quentin, and as a consequence Peronne. Sir Henry
Rawlinson in his official dispatch remarked that he was "filled with admiration
for the surpassing daring" of the troops who had taken a position of the
greatest "natural strength and eminent tactical value." Men of the Second
Guards Division and of four other German Divisions were found among the
prisoners. The Australian exploit may be said to have been of a peculiarly
national character, as there was not one of the Australian
communities&mdash;Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, West Australia,
Tasmania&mdash;which did not play some honourable part in the battle.</p>
<p>Passing northward from the victorious Australians, September 1 saw the
attack carried all along the line, the 3rd Corps advancing upon Rancourt, Priez
Farm, and the line to Bouchavesnes. On the left the hard-worked 54th and 55th
Brigades did splendidly, especially the 8th East Surrey under Colonel Irwin.
Surrey men and Germans lay thick round Priez Farm, but this key-position
remained in the hands of the English, after a very bitter struggle. The 7th
Queen's took Fregicourt, while the 7th West Kents helped the Welshmen at
Sailly-Sallisel. The trench mortar batteries, pushing right up regardless of
all risk and smothering the German strong points by their concentrated fire,
did great work in these operations, especially the 142nd T. M. Battery near
Priez Farm. All these various advances were as remarkable for their tactical
skill as for the valour shown by all ranks. The latter had been a constant
asset, but the former grew with time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Forty-seventh and Fifty-eighth Divisions had each done
splendidly and secured their objectives, including Rancourt and Bouchavesnes.
The main road from Bapaume to Peronne had been passed and the whole of the old
Somme battlefield been cleared in this direction. Prisoners were taken from
four different divisions in the course of the fight. It had taken four months'
fighting in 1916 to conquer the ground which had been now cleared by the Fifth
and Third Corps inside of ten days.</p>
<p>The advance was continued on September 2, as it was argued that however
exhausted the victors might be the vanquished would surely be even more so. A
new actor made a first appearance in the greatest of all dramas about this
time, for the Seventy-fourth Division, which had done good service in Palestine
under General Girdwood, made its first attack in a European line of battle.
This unit was originally composed entirely of Yeomanry, and it had still
retained a large proportion of this splendid material in the ranks, with a
broken spur as their witty and picturesque divisional emblem. The tale of the
British Yeomanry in the East is one which will be among the most romantic in
the war; and the way in which farmers' sons from Dorset or Fife charged with
cold steel and rode down the Eastern cavalry or broke the ranks of the Turkish
infantry is as fantastic an incident as the mind of a prophetic novelist could
have furnished. Indeed it may be said generally that none of the many imaginary
forecasts of the coming war equalled the reality in the broad sweep of its
incidents and the grotesque combinations which ensued.</p>
<p>The Seventy-fourth had now taken over from the Fifty-eighth Division. They
were pushed at once into heavy fighting, advancing rapidly down the western
slope of the Tortille valley, through Moislains, and over the canal. In their
eager zeal they had not mopped up sufficiently, and they soon found themselves
under a fire from front and rear which no troops could endure. They were driven
back to near the point from which they started and their losses were
considerable. The Australians formed a defensive flank on the south, and the
Forty-seventh on the north, and a line of resistance was built up between them
from Haut Allaines on the right to the western bank of the Tortille. The
Yeomanry had before evening endured a very terrible welcome to the Western
front.</p>
<p>The Eighteenth Division on the left had also had some severe fighting which
fell chiefly upon the depleted 53rd Brigade. It secured the high ground in the
north of St. Pierre Vaast Wood, the whole of which was cleared by the 8th
Berkshires. On September 3 and 4 the division continued to advance across the
canal and the Tortille upon the line of Nurlu. On the evening of September 4
its long term of hard and glorious service was ended and the Twelfth Division
took its place. Its losses had been 2700, while it had captured during the
battle some 1800 prisoners and many guns.</p>
<p>From this date until September 10, which saw them in front of the outposts
of the Hindenburg Line, the record of the Third Corps was one of steady and
uninterrupted progress. The German machine-guns were now, as always, a cause of
constant worry, loss, and delay, but the remorseless drive of the British
infantry was for ever beating in the obstinate rearguards. September 6 marked
an advance of nearly three miles along the whole Corps front, the Twelfth,
Forty-seventh, and Seventy-fourth moving in line and flooding over the village
sites of Nurlu, Templeux, Driencourt, and Longavesnes. The work of Owen's 35th
Brigade at Nurlu was particularly trying, for it was held up by wire and
machine-guns, the 7th Sussex, 7th Norfolks, and 9th Essex all losing heavily in
some very desperate fighting which gave little result. Finally, on September 6,
the 1st Cambridge and 5th Berkshires reinforced the troops already mentioned
and, under a renewed barrage, they broke the line and carried the position. On
this date the Forty-seventh Londoners, who had done such solid work, were
ordered off to join another corps, the Fifty-eighth moving up once more to take
their place.</p>
<p>On September 7 the weather, which had been excellent since August 22, broke
badly, but the Corps improved its position in spite of wind and rain, closing
up to what was known to be the German fixed position. On the 8th both
Ep&eacute;hy and Peizi&egrave;res were touched, but the Germans were fairly at
bay now, and instant counter-attacks showed that their resistance would be
serious. The final position was about 1000 yards west of these villages. The
Fifty-eighth Division on September 10 endeavoured to gain more ground in this
quarter, but neither they nor the Seventy-fourth upon their right could make
any impression upon the strong German line. There was a definite pause,
therefore, while tanks, guns, and all other appliances for a serious assault
upon a fortified position were hurried to the front. On this date, September
12, General Butler was able to resume his command of the Third Corps, while
General Godley, after his term of brilliant service, returned to his own unit,
the Twenty-second Corps.</p>
<p>We must now return to the Australian Corps on the right, whom we left in the
flush of victory after their fine conquest of Peronne. Up to the end of August,
Monash and his men had accounted for 14,500 prisoners and 170 guns since the
beginning of the advance. On September 1, as already mentioned, Peronne had
been penetrated by the Fifth Australian Division, but after the fall of Mont
St. Quentin, and the failure of their efforts at recovery, the Germans must
have seen that it was hopeless to hold the place, so that the stormers were
eventually only faced by a rearguard of stalwarts. Anvil Wood to the north-east
was taken on the same day. The order of the Divisions upon the Australian front
at this time was that the Third was on the extreme left, acting with the Third
Corps, the Second was just north of Peronne, the Fifth was opposite to Peronne,
and the Thirty-second British Division was on the extreme right, near Brie and
St. Christ, in touch with the French.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of September 2 Rosenthal's indefatigable Second
Division continued to advance from Mont St. Quentin, attacking to the
north-east so as to get possession of the high ground south-west of Aizecourt.
They attained their objectives and formed a flank along the spur from Mont St.
Quentin to Aizecourt in order to protect the Third Corps in the difficult
operations already described. By this movement to the north the Second
Australian got in front of the Third Australian Division, which was crowded out
of the line, all but two battalions. The Fifth Australians spent the day in
clearing up Peronne. Altogether some 500 additional prisoners fell into their
hands during the day.</p>
<p>There was some readjustment and reorganisation necessary after this
strenuous work, but by September 5 the advance was going forward again and
Flamicourt was taken. It is an open rolling country of large horizons, and the
Germans were slowly retreating with strong rearguards. Doingt, Le Mesnil, and
the river crossings of Brie and St. Christ were all occupied, though the latter
cost a severe fight, with 150 prisoners as trophies. On the 6th and 7th the
Corps were sweeping on with their own 13th Australian Light Horse doing the
cavalry work in front of them, fit representatives of those splendid horsemen
who have left an enduring reputation in Egypt and Palestine. Late in the
afternoon of September 7 the Corps front crossed the railway between Vermand
and Vendelles, and began to approach the historic point which had marked the
British line before March 21. On September 10 Strickland's First British
Division arrived in this area, and with the Thirty-second Division and some
other units began to form the nucleus of another Corps, the Ninth, which should
operate under General Braithwaite to the right of the Australians. On the 12th
the Australians took Jean-court, and were in touch with the outlying defences
of the great Hindenburg Line, which they at once proceeded to attack. On
September 13 there was a sharp fight round Le Verguier, and an advance all
along the line in which the objectives were taken and the tanks did some
particularly fine work. Tanks and barrages that day combined to keep the
Australian losses at a very low figure, and yet some 40 guns and 4500 prisoners
had been taken before next morning. The First Australian Division on the left
secured all the front defences which guarded the main Hindenburg position,
while the Fourth on the right worked its way well forward, though hardly level
with its neighbours. The Ninth Corps on the right had also come on, though it
was also rather behind the Australians. The average advance of the latter
amounted to three miles in depth on a four-mile front.</p>
<p>Nothing could be more in-and-out than the German fighting during all this
stage of the war. Sometimes their conduct was heroic in the extreme, sometimes
it was exceedingly cowardly and slack. The observer could not but recall the
famous description which an American General of old gave of his militia when he
said with native raciness that "they either fought like the devil or ran like
hell." The machine-gunners were usually, however, in the former category, and
they, with the heavy guns, represented the real resistance, while the infantry
only needed to be reached&mdash;in some cases not even that&mdash;to throw up
their hands and come over as joyful captives. There were already two Germans in
British hands for every Briton in Germany, in spite of the heavy losses in
March and April.</p>
<p>Returning to the Third Corps, which we left in front of the Hindenburg
system in the second week of September in the Ep&eacute;hy district. The
obstacle in front of the British was very formidable, for it con, sisted of
their own old trench lines of March, with the Hindenburg system behind them.
They had now reached the former British reserve line which had Ronssoy,
Lempire, Ep&eacute;hy, and Peizi&egrave;res as <i>points d'appui</i>. It was a
front so strong that in March it is doubtful if the Germans could have carried
it had the line not given way elsewhere. It was particularly necessary that the
enemy should hold on to this stretch, because it covered the point where the
great Canal du Nord ran under a tunnel for six miles between Bellicourt and
Vandhuile&mdash;the only place where tanks could be used for an advance. The
Germans had therefore massed strong forces here, including their famous Alpine
Corps.</p>
<p>The first task of the Third Corps was to get possession of the old British
line in front of it, whence observation could be got of the Hindenburg
position. This attack would form part of a general movement by the two southern
Corps of the Third Army, the three Corps of the Fourth Army, and the northern
portion of the First French Army. On that great day of battle, September 18,
there was a universal advance along the line, which was carried out in the case
of the Third Corps by the Seventy-fourth Division (Girdwood) on the right, the
Eighteenth (Lee) right centre, the Twelfth (Higginson) left centre, and the
Fifty-eighth Division left. Many of the characteristics of old trench warfare
had come back into the battle, which was no longer open fighting, but is to be
conceived as an attack upon innumerable scattered trenches and posts very
strongly held by the Germans, and their ultimate reduction by independent
platoons and companies acting under their own regimental officers.</p>
<p>The advance was at 5.20 in the morning, with a thick mist and driving rain
to cover, and also to confuse, the movement. The Yeomen of the Seventy-fourth
upon the right came away in excellent style, keeping in close touch with the
Australian left, and were soon in possession of the Templeux quarries, a very
formidable position. At the other end of the line a brigade of the Fifty-eighth
Londoners did excellently well, and by 10 o'clock had a good grip upon the
village of Peizi&egrave;res. In the centre, however, the resistance was very
stiff and the losses heavy. None the less the Eighteenth Division, which has
always been a particularly difficult unit to stop, made their way through
Ronssoy and Lempire. The Eighteenth Division did wonderful work that day, and
though nominally only the 54th and 55th Brigades were engaged, they were each
strengthened by a battalion from the spare brigade. There were particular
difficulties in the path of the 55th Brigade, but General Wood personally
accompanied the leading battalion and so kept in touch with the situation,
varying his activities by throwing bricks and old boots down a German dug-out,
and so bringing out 20 prisoners as his own personal take. He was wounded in
the course of the day. Ronssoy, which fell to the 55th Brigade, was held by the
Alexander Regiment of Prussian Guards, several hundred samples being taken for
the British cages. The taking of Lempire, carried out mainly by the 11th Royal
Fusiliers, was also a very gallant affair, though it was a day or two before it
was completely in British possession. The Twelfth; which is also an all-English
division with a splendid fighting record, was held for a time before
Ep&eacute;hy, but would take no denial, and after heavy losses and severe
fighting was east of that village by 11 o'clock. Thus by midday the whole line
of villages was in the hands of General Butler's Corps. The left was out of
touch with the Fifth Corps, but all else was in perfect order. These positions
were full of wire and concrete, and were defended by the hardy German Alpine
Corps who fought to the death, so that the achievement was a great one.</p>
<p>All four divisions endeavoured to improve their positions in the afternoon,
but they had no great success. The Seventy-fourth Division did the best, as on
the right it was able to secure Benjamin's Post, but on the left it was held up
by the general stagnation of the line. The centre divisions met a German
counter-attack delivered by the Hundred and twenty-first Division, who had been
rushed up in buses from Maretz, and this they entirely dispersed, but neither
they nor the Fifty-eighth on the left were able to make any notable
advance.</p>
<p>The troops were now faced by a perfect warren of trenches and posts which
were held with great gallantry by the Alpine Corps. There was no rest for the
British, and the night of the 18/19th was spent by the same men who had been
fighting all day in bombing up the trenches and endeavouring to enlarge their
gains. The same sort of fighting, carried on by small groups of determined men
led by subalterns or non-commissioned officers, and faced by other small groups
equally determined, went on along the whole line during September 19 and 20. In
those two days the advance went steadily on, in spite of many a local rebuff
and many a temporary check. On September 21 the battle was renewed still in the
same fashion with heavy losses upon both sides. At one time the steady flow of
the British tide turned for a time to an ebb, as a very strong German
counter-attack came rolling into it, and swept it back along the whole front
from the positions which it had overflowed in the morning. The Seventy-fourth
was forced out of Quinnemont Farm, the Eighteenth out of Doleful Post, the
Twelfth were checked at Bird Trench, while the Fifty-eighth, intermingled with
men from the right wing of the Fifth Corps, could not get past Kildare Avenue.
These fanciful names, unseen on any save a large-scale trench map, bulked large
in this bloody battle, for they were master points which controlled the ground
around. The sun set with the Germans in the ascendant, and the British clawing
desperately at a series of posts and farms which they could just hold against
very heavy pressure. One of the most severe engagements was that of the 10th
Essex of the 53rd Brigade when they attempted the Knoll, a position from which
the whole Hindenburg Line would have been exposed. It was said by experienced
soldiers that more severe machine-gun fire had seldom been seen than on this
occasion, and the tanks engaged were unable to use their own guns, so thick
were the driving storms of bullets which beat upon their iron sides and
searched every aperture. The Essex men lost heavily, and the Knoll was not
taken. This and the other posts mentioned above were the cause of much trouble
to the Americans on September 27.</p>
<p>It was a disappointing day, but the British soldiers, dog-weary as they
were, were in no mood to leave matters undecided. The operations must be
carried to a successful end. "Hard pounding, gentlemen," as the great Duke
said, "but we shall see who can pound longest!" Just after midnight the tired
ranks were stumbling forward once more, determined to have those posts back if
human resolution could win them. They had their reward, and it was a
conspicuous illustration of the maxim that, however weary you may be, the enemy
may be even more so. Before the full light of morning half the line of posts
was in the hands of the persevering British. The capture of Bracton Post by
Colonel Dawson's 6th West Kents was a particularly brilliant bit of work. The
success stretched along the whole Corps front, and though the afternoon of
September 22 saw a whole series of counter-attacks, especially upon the
Seventy-fourth and Eighteenth Divisions, there was no weakening of the new
line. One German battalion engaged in these counter-attacks was literally
annihilated as a barrage fell behind them through which they could not retire.
It is on record that in spite of the very arduous service the spirits and
morale of the men were never higher. Twice after a German repulse the men of
the 6th Northants and 11th Royal Fusiliers could not be held back from jumping
out of the trenches and tearing after them, while a stretcher-bearer was
observed to run up and down the parados of the trench throwing cartridges down
to the defenders and shouting, "Shoot, boys, shoot!"</p>
<p>By September 23 the Third Corps had gained most of those posts which had
been its objectives on September 18, and if the battle took longer than had
been anticipated it was all the greater drain upon the worn resources of the
Germans. They were still intent upon making machines do the work of men, and it
was no unusual thing to take about as many machine-guns as prisoners in some of
their posts. The situation was still not quite clear on the left, where the
right flank of the Fifth Corps was engaged in severe local fighting in the
neighbourhood of Kildare and Limerick Post. The Egg Post on the front of the
Eighteenth Division had also been able to maintain itself in the German line.
These various isolated strong points were the same which had held out with such
unavailing gallantry on March 21, when, instead of forming the German rear,
they were the extreme outliers of Gough's Army.</p>
<p>Whilst the Third Corps on the left of the Fourth Army had been gradually
fighting its way forward from September 18 onwards, beating down one after the
other the outposts and obstacles which, like the moraine before a glacier,
formed a rugged line in front of the great main Hindenburg system, Sir John
Monash and his men were keeping pace with them, step by step, on their right,
the First Australian Division being in close liaison on September 18 with the
Seventy-fourth Yeomanry. Many a separate volume will be written upon the
exploits of our Australian brothers, and General Monash has himself written a
record of their last glorious hundred days, so that the chronicler has the less
compunction if he is not always able to give the amount of detail which he
would desire.</p>
<p>At 5.20 on September 18 the Australians went forward with a rapidity which
seems to have completely taken aback the German defenders, who in many cases
ran from their guns, or threw up their hands in detachments, when they saw the
active figures of the infantrymen springing eagerly forward behind the line of
tanks. The weather was bad, the ground slippery with rain, and the attack
expected, but none of these factors interfered with the result. The First
Australians, as stated, were in the line on the left, the 1st and 3rd Brigades
in the van, while on the right were the 4th and 12th Brigades of the Fourth
Australian Division in close touch with the British First Division on their
right. By midday everything had gone down before them, and the measure of their
success was the 146 officers and 3900 men with 77 guns which formed their
trophies before evening. On one side they had reached Le Verguier, and on the
other they were past Templeux. A minefield containing thirty-five mines was
found in front of the Fourth Australian Division, another instance of the fact
that the tanks had brought a nautical element into warfare. The Australian
casualties were surprisingly light considering their splendid results, for they
did not amount to more than a thousand men.</p>
<p>Some description must now be given of the work of the Ninth Corps, which had
assembled under General Braithwaite on the extreme right of the British Army
and which first came into action on September 18 in this hard fight for the
Hindenburg Outpost Line. The Corps consisted at this time of three divisions,
the First, Sixth, and Thirty-second, under Strickland, Marden, and Lambert. On
September 18 the Corps attacked with the Sixth Division in touch with the
French on the right, and the First Division with the Fourth Australians on the
left. The order of brigades from the right was 71, 16, 1, and 2. It was known
that two German divisions, the Seventy-ninth and Twenty-fifth, with two others
in reserve, were lying opposite behind strong defences, so that a hard battle
might well be expected.</p>
<p>The Thirty-fourth French Division on the immediate right brought off a very
useful and successful coup on September 17 by capturing Round Hill and part of
Savy Wood, which reassured General Marden as to the safety of his right flank.
This division appeared to have the more difficult task as Badger Copse, the
village of Fresnoy, and part of the very strong system known as the
Quadrilateral came within their area.</p>
<p>The attack went forward under pelting rain at 5.20 in the morning of
September 18. Following the operations from the north we have to deal first
with the 2nd Brigade on the flank. The left-hand battalion; the 2nd Sussex,
kept up with the Australians, who had advanced without a check and carried
every obstacle. The 2nd King's Royal Rifles, on the other hand, had lost
direction and, wandering too far south across the face of their neighbours,
found themselves mixed up with the Sixth Division in its fruitless attempt upon
the powerfully defended village of Fresnoy. The 1st Brigade, to the south, was
led by the 1st Camerons and the 1st Loyal North Lancashires. The former stormed
on, breaking through all opposition and throwing out defensive flanks as their
valour carried them ahead of the line. Meanwhile the failure of the Sixth
Division to take Fresnoy made it impossible to pass along the valley which is
overlooked by that village, so that the right of the First Division was
entirely hung up. On the other hand, the 2nd King's Royal Rifles recovered
their bearings as the day went on, and fought their way up the right side of
the Omignon valley in splendid style until they were in touch with the 2nd
Sussex on the northern slope. In the south, however, the task of the Sixth
Division continued to be a very hard one, and the Seventy-ninth German Division
resisted with great determination. The Quadrilateral consisted of a system of
trenches sited on the highest part of the plateau between Holnon and Fayet, its
northern face at this time forming part of the German front line. This proved
to be an exceedingly difficult work to silence, as reinforcements could be
dribbled up through cleverly concealed communication trenches. In spite of
everything; however, the 71st Brigade and their French neighbours captured
Holnon village and the western edge of the Quadrilateral by 8 A.M. The main
body of the work was not yet taken, however, so the East Anglians of the 71st
Brigade had to form a defensive line facing towards it and the village of
Selency, to meet any counter-attack which might sweep up against the flank of
the Corps. The left of the line then got forward in safety, and the 2nd Brigade
was able to report at noon that both they and the Fourth Australians were on
their extreme objective. Indeed the latter, having completely crumpled up the
One hundred and nineteenth German Division, were now considerably ahead of the
allotted line.</p>
<p>Berthaucourt had been captured by the First Division, but progress in the
Fresnoy direction was still very slow. About 3.30 P.M. hostile counter-attacks
were launched south of Berthaucourt and opposite Fresnoy. These were repulsed
by steady rifle-fire, but the general situation was still obscure. All the
afternoon there was very heavy fighting on the front of the Sixth Division,
especially east of Holnon village, and on the west side of the Quadrilateral.
The French had been held up on the right. So matters remained until evening. It
had been a day of hard work and varying success on this portion of the line,
but the capture of 18 officers and 541 men with 8 field-guns showed that some
advance had been made. It was short, however, of what had been hoped.</p>
<p>The next morning saw the battle renewed. The neighbourhood of Fresnoy and of
the Quadrilateral was now more strongly held than ever, the Germans being
encouraged, no doubt, by their successful defence of the day before. The
fighting during this day was desultory, and no particular advance was made by
either division. In the south the French failed to capture Manchester Hill,
which was an ugly menace to the right flank of the Ninth Corps.</p>
<p>The Forty-sixth Division (Boyd) had been added to the strength of the Ninth
Corps, and when this welcome addition had been put in upon the left wing it
enabled the others to contract their front and thicken their array. At 7 P.M.
on September 22 the Germans attacked the Forty-sixth Division in its new
position, just east of Berthaucourt, but they were driven back after a slight
initial success.</p>
<p>There was a fresh attack on September 24 in which the Ninth Corps
co-operated with the Thirty-sixth Corps on its right, in order to try and
overcome the German strongholds on the right of their front which were holding
them of from the Hindenburg Line. The order of the British line was that the
Sixth Division was on the right, the First in the centre, and the Forty-sixth
on the left.</p>
<p>Although this attack, which was launched at 5 A.M., was expected by the
enemy, good progress was made along the whole front. The Quadrilateral again
proved, however, that it was a very formidable obstacle, and there was stout
resistance from Pontruet village, just east of Berthaucourt. The Sixth Division
had closed in on the Quadrilateral from north, west, and south, and were at
close grips with it at all three quarters. There was continuous bomb-fighting
all day in this neighbourhood, but the situation was still obscure, and until
it cleared no progress could be made towards Selency. The First Division in the
centre had made splendid progress, but the Forty-sixth Division had been unable
to take Pontruet, and the guns from this village struck full against the left
flank of the 2nd Brigade in its advance, causing very heavy losses to the 1st
Northamptons. So murderous were the casualties in this portion of the field
that the position of the forward troops was untenable, and the remains of the
Northamptons had to throw back a protective flank to the north to cover the
approaches from Pontruet. The 2nd Sussex on their right managed to retain their
advanced position, and one company, though very weak and short of cartridges,
baffled a counter-attack by a sudden bayonet charge in which they took 50
prisoners.</p>
<p>The attack upon Fresnoy village was made by the 3rd Brigade, the 1st
Gloucesters being immediately opposite to it. Advancing under a strong barrage
the West Country men went straight for their objective, taking both the village
and the strongly organised cemetery to the south of it. On the left of the
village the British were held up by strong wire and several vicious
machine-guns, but the Germans made the gallant mistake of running out in front
of the wire with bombs in their hands, upon which they were charged and many of
them were taken by the Gloucesters. The German gunners in the rear then turned
their pieces upon both captors and captives, so the company concerned was held
down in shell holes all day and withdrew as best they could after dark. The 3rd
Brigade then extended, getting into touch with the 2nd Brigade near
Cornovillers Wood.</p>
<p>On the left of the 3rd Brigade the strong position of Fresnoy Cemetery had
been carried, and the tireless infantry swarmed on into Marronni&egrave;res
Wood, which was full of lurking machine-guns and needed careful handling. It
was finally surrounded by the 3rd Brigade, who mopped it up at their leisure,
taking out of it a large number of prisoners. The 2nd King's Royal Rifles of
the 2nd Brigade kept parallel with their advance, and also cleared a
considerable stretch of woodland, while the 3rd Brigade, seeing signs of
weakening on the German front, pushed forward and seized Gricourt, a most
important point, the 2nd Welsh gaining the village and driving back a
subsequent counter-attack. Finally, the complete victory in this portion of the
field was rounded off when, after dark, the 2nd King's Royal Rifles secured a
dangerous sunken road across the front which had been a storm-centre all
day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Forty-sixth Division had fought its way to the north of
Pontruet, but as this unit was relied upon for the great pending operations on
the Hindenburg Main Line, it was thought impolitic to involve it too deeply in
local fighting. The line was drawn, therefore, to the west of the village. The
total captures of the day had been 30 officers and 1300 men. The French to the
south had also had a good day, capturing all their objectives except Manchester
Hill.</p>
<p>The Sixth Division had not yet cleared the Quadrilateral, and the whole of
September 25 was devoted to that desperate but necessary work. It was a case of
bomb and bayonet, with slow laborious progress. Finally, about 6 P.M. General
Marden was able to announce that the whole wide entanglement had been occupied,
though not yet mopped up. The village of Selency had also fallen, while on the
right the French had attacked and captured Manchester Hill. Strong resistance
was encountered by the First Division near Gricourt. The German soldiers were
again and again seen to hold up their hands, and then to be driven into the
fight once more by their officers with their revolvers. Late on the 26th, after
a short hurricane bombardment, the 3rd Brigade rushed forward again. The enemy
had disappeared into their dug-outs under the stress of the shells, so that the
British infantry were able to get on to them before they could emerge and to
make many prisoners. Colonel Tweedie of the Gloucesters was in local command of
this well-managed affair. Altogether it was a good day for the First Division,
which had gained a line of positions, repelled heavy counters, and secured 800
prisoners, 600 falling to the 3rd Brigade, who had done the heavy end of the
work.</p>
<p>All was now ready for the great move which should break the spine of the
whole German resistance. There was still some preliminary struggling for
positions of departure and final readjustments of the line, but they were all
part of the great decisive operation of September 29 and may best be included
in that account. The chronicler can never forget how, late upon the eve of the
battle, he drove in a darkened motor along pitch-black roads across the rear of
the Army, and saw the whole eastern heaven flickering with war light as far as
the eyes could see, as the aurora rises and falls in the northern sky. So
terrific was the spectacle that the image of the Day of Judgment rose
involuntarily to his mind. It was indeed the day of Judgment for
Germany&mdash;the day when all those boastful words and wicked thoughts and
arrogant actions were to meet their fit reward, and the wrong-doers to be
humbled in the dust. On that day Germany's last faint hope was shattered, and
every day after was but a nearer approach to that pit which had been dug for
her by her diplomatists, her journalists, her professors, her junkers, and all
the vile, noisy crew who had brought this supreme cataclysm upon the world.</p>
<p>The reader will note then that we leave the Fourth Army, consisting from the
right of the Ninth Corps, the Australians, and the Third Corps, in front of the
terrific barrier of the main Hindenburg Line. We shall now hark back and follow
the advance of Byng's Third Army from its attack on August 21st until, five
weeks later, it found itself in front of the same position, carrying on the
line of its comrades in the south.</p>

<h2><a id="chap4" name="chap4">IV. THE ATTACK OF BYNG'S THIRD ARMY</a><br>
August 21, 1918, to September 29, 1918</h2>
<p class="chaphead">Advance of Shute's Fifth Corps&mdash;Great feat in crossing
the Ancre&mdash;Across the old battlefield&mdash;Final position of Fifth Corps
opposite Hindenburg's Main Line&mdash;Advance of Haldane's Sixth
Corps&mdash;Severe fighting&mdash;Arrival of Fifty-second

decisive battle.</p>
<p class="first">ON August 20 General Mangin had pushed forward the Tenth
French Army, which formed the left of his force, and attacked along a
sixteen-mile front from the Oise to the Aisne, thus connecting up the original
operations with those initiated by Marshal Haig. The movement was very
successful, taking some 10,000 prisoners and gaining several miles of ground.
We have now to turn to the left of Rawlinson's advance, and to consider the new
movement which brought Byng's Third British Army into the fray.</p>
<p>Upon the left of the Third Corps, which was, as already described, fighting
its way along the north bank of the Somme, there lay the Fifth Corps (Shute).
On its left was the Fourth Corps (Harper), and north of that the Sixth Corps
(Haldane). It was to these three units that the opening of the attack was
entrusted. The frontage was about ten miles, extending from Moyenneville in the
north to the Ancre in the south, so that it just cleared the impossible country
of the first Somme battlefield&mdash;which even now a spectator cannot survey
without a feeling of wondering horror, so churned up is it from end to end by
the constant thresh of shells, burst of mines, and the spade-work of three
great armies. The result of the first day's fighting was an advance of several
miles along the whole front, with the capture of Beaucourt, Bucquoy,
Moyenneville, and other villages, the farthest advance coming close to the
Arras-Albert Railway, and to the village of Achiet-le-Grand.</p>
<p>There had been some recent retirement of the German line at Serre, which
gave the clue to the British Commanders that a general retreat might take place
on this particular portion of the front. It was very necessary, therefore, to
strike at once while there was certainly something solid to strike
against&mdash;and all the more necessary if there was a chance of catching the
enemy in the act of an uncompleted withdrawal.</p>
<p>It was nearly five o'clock when the battle began, and it was the turn of the
Germans to find how fog may disarrange the most elaborate preparations for
defence. The mist was so thick that it could only be compared to that which had
shrouded the German advance on March 21. Several miles of undulating country
lay immediately in front of the attackers, leading up to a formidable line of
defence, the old Albert-Arras Railway lying with its fortified embankments
right across the path of the British Army. Bucquoy in the centre of the line,
with the Logeast Wood to the east of it, and the muddy, sluggish Ancre with its
marshy banks on the extreme right, were notable features in the ground to be
assaulted.</p>

</div>
<br>
<p>The Fifth Corps, under General Shute, followed the curve of the River Ancre
on a front of 9000 yards. It was poorly provided with guns as the Corps to the
left required a concentration of artillery, and it had no tanks since the
marshy valley and sluggish stream lay before it. The Thirty-eighth Welsh
Division (Cubitt) lay on the right and Campbell's Twenty-first on the left,
each of them with two brigades in front and one in reserve. The Seventeenth
Division (Robertson) was in support. The problem in front of General Shute's
Corps was a most difficult one. Before it lay this evil watercourse which had
been flooded by the Germans and was 300 yards wide at one part. All bridges
were gone, and the banks were low and boggy. The main stream was over six feet
deep, and its channel could not be distinguished from the general flood. The
whole morass was covered by a tangle of fallen trees, reeds, and artificial
obstructions. To the east of the river ran high ground, strongly held and
fortified, from Tara Hill above Albert to the Thiepval Height, south of
Grandcourt. The west bank was so overlooked that no one could move unscathed.
And yet it was clear that until this formidable obstacle was surmounted it was
neither possible for Rawlinson to advance from Albert, nor for the Fourth Corps
on the left to assault Miraumont.</p>
<p>The movements of Shute's Corps on August 21 were preliminary to their real
attack. On that date the Twenty-first Division advanced on the left flank, in
close touch with the Forty-second Division of the Fourth Corps. Beaucourt was
taken in the movement. By this operation the Twenty-first Division reached a
point where the flood was narrower at St. Pierre Divion, and here some bridges
could be constructed and preparations made for the passage.</p>
<p>In the case of Harper's Fourth Corps on the left the advance on August 21
was limited, since no serious attack could be made upon Miraumont while the
high ground to the south was untaken. At this date Harper's Corps consisted of
five divisions, the Fifth, Thirty-seventh, Forty-second, Sixty-third, and the
New Zealanders. Of these the Thirty-seventh Division (Williams) was on the
left, covering the flank of the Sixth Corps, while the Forty-second
(Solly-Flood) was on the right. We shall now follow in the first instance the
work of the Fifth Corps on the extreme right from the beginning of the battle
until the pause preceding the attack of September 18. There are, it is true,
objections to continuous narrative, since it stands in the way of a bird's-eye
view of the whole operation; but on the other hand the object and scope of any
series of advances become unintelligible unless they are linked up from day to
day. We shall therefore take the Fifth Corps as one story until it reaches the
Hindenburg Line. We shall then follow the work of the other flank corps of
Byng's Third Army, which was Haldane's Sixth Corps, bringing it up to the same
point. It will finally, after we have established two solid bastions, be easy
to deal with the central unit, Harper's Fourth Corps, which filled up the space
between. We shall then have a narrative which will cover four strenuous weeks
in which the Third Army carried out a notable advance.</p>
<p>It has been explained that Shute's Fifth Corps found itself with 9000 yards
of river in front of it, and that on August 21 the Twenty-first Division had
seized a favourable point for crossing near St. Pierre Divion. There was no
further advance on the morning of the 22nd, but to the south Rawlinson's left
was fighting its way to the eastern exits of Albert, and the bridges in the
town were being got ready for use. All day a heavy fire was kept up on the
German lines east of the river, and especially upon the rising ground called
Usna Hill. As the day passed small bodies of troops began to cross the Ancre
from the Fifth Corps front and to make a lodgement at the farther side.
South-west of Thiepval part of the 14th Welsh from the 114th Brigade, wading
over breast deep with their rifles and pouches held high, got into a trench on
the farther bank and held their own. The Twenty-first Division also got some
companies across at St. Pierre, while it beat off several attacks upon the
north side of the river. During the night the 50th Brigade of the Seventeenth
Division was slipped into the line, between Campbell's North Countrymen on the
left and Cubitt's Welshmen on the right. General Shute was now ready for his
great effort in crossing the river.</p>
<p>The first stage in this difficult operation was carried out early on August
23, when the 113th Welsh Brigade, which had quickly passed over the Albert
bridges, made a sudden attack about dawn on Usna Hill, at the same time as the
Eighteenth Division to the south attacked Tara Hill. The position was taken
with 200 prisoners, while the 115th Welsh Brigade got up to the chalk-pit, east
of Aveluy, where they joined hands with their comrades on the Usna line. Thus,
before evening of August 23 the Thirty-eighth Division was east of the river
from Albert to Aveluy, while the Twenty-first still held its bridgeheads at St.
Pierre Divion. The slope of the Thiepval Ridge with all its fortifications
still lay in front, and this was the next objective of the Fifth Corps. It was
carried by a night attack on August 23-24.</p>
<p>A large portion of the central line was so flooded that no advance was
possible. It was planned, therefore, that the assault should be on both wings,
the area around Authuille being nipped out and cleared at a later stage. The
operation began on the evening of August 23 by a movement along the northern
bank of the river to the south-east of Miraumont, so as to partly encircle that
village and help forward the Fourth Corps on the left, who were still held up
in front of it. The main Ancre attack was carried out by the 113th Brigade on
the right, who came away with a fine impetus on the eastern slopes of Usna
Hill, capturing La Boiselle and reaching a point 1100 yards west of Ovillers.
The 114th Brigade on the left had with great difficulty and corresponding
valour crossed the Ancre under machine-gun fire and had established themselves
on the slopes, fighting their way forward all day until they reached a point
north-west of Pozi&egrave;res. All around Thiepval there was close fighting in
which this brigade acted in close liaison with the 50th Brigade. In this
struggle many gallant deeds were done, and it is recorded, among others, how
Lieutenant Griffiths of the Welsh Regiment advanced using his Lewis gun as if
it were a rifle. He is said to have slain sixteen Germans in this novel fashion
before his own wounds brought him fainting to the ground. According to the plan
the two converging brigades left a large central section untouched, which was
promptly mopped up by the 115th Brigade, so that every man of the Thirty-eighth
Division was engaged in this fine operation.</p>
<p>Farther to the left the 6th Dorsets of the 50th Brigade, in spite of gas
clouds and machine-guns had crossed the Ancre in its narrowest reach, where
some sort of bridges had been prepared. With great energy and initiative they
cleared up the front trenches and pockets so as to give room for a deployment,
pushing their patrols out towards Thiepval, but they were driven in again by an
attack from the Schwaben Redoubt. The rest of the 50th Brigade (Gwyn-Thomas)
had followed, most of the infantry wading across in the dark up to their waists
in mud and water. Pushing on, as part of the general advance, all three
battalions of the 50th Brigade went forward, capturing several hundred
prisoners, but deviating so far from their course that when they thought and
reported that they had captured Courcelette it was really Pozi&egrave;res which
they had got. In the early afternoon Allason's 52nd Brigade was pushed in on
the right of the 50th Brigade, connecting them up with the Welshmen. The
mistake in the direction of the 50th Brigade was not an unmixed evil, for while
it left the Twenty-first Division with its right flank exposed and in
considerable difficulty, it made a pocket of a large number of Germans in front
of the Welshmen, 900 of whom were captured. General Robertson saved the
situation on the left by pushing in his reserve brigade, the 51st (Dudgeon),
and so filling the gap between his division and that of General Campbell.</p>
<p>The latter division, especially the 64th Brigade, which had pushed on to
Miraumont the night before, had some desperate fighting. The whole brigade was
passed in single file over two foot-bridges. At 11.30 P.M. they were assembled
upon the south bank and ready to start. A barrage had been arranged for their
attack, but owing to changes in plan it was not thick or effective. The advance
was made by the 15th Durhams on the right and the 9th Yorkshire Light Infantry
on the left with the 1st East Yorks in support, the column being guided by
means of compass bearing, and by the presence of the Ancre on the left flank.
This nocturnal march in the face of the enemy was a very remarkable and daring
one, for the ground was pitted with craters and there were two ravines with
sheer sides at right angles to the advance. Touch was kept by shouting, which
seems to have confused rather than informed the enemy, who only fought in
patches. Grandcourt was overrun with 100 prisoners, 20 machine-guns, and 4
field-pieces. Early in the morning General McCulloch, who had conducted the
operation, was badly wounded and the command passed to Colonel Holroyd Smith of
the Durhams. When full daylight came the brigade was deeply embedded in the
German line, and the enemy closed in upon it but their attacks were repulsed.
The soldiers were compelled to lie flat, however, in order to escape from the
heavy fire. The 110th Brigade of the same division had advanced on the right,
but it was acting in close liaison with the Seventeenth Division, and
independent of the isolated unit, which was now completely alone on the hill
south of Miraumont, their East Yorkshire supports being at Grandcourt, and so
much out of touch with the advanced line that the Officer Commanding imagined
the stragglers to be all that was left of the brigade. The first intimation of
the true state of affairs was given by the wounded Brigadier as he passed on
his way to the casualty station. About 10.30 Captain Spicer, the Brigade Major,
got back by crawling, and reported that the advanced line still held, though
weak in numbers. Aeroplane reconnaissance confirmed the report. All day the
valiant band held out until in the evening the advance of the Forty-second
Division on their left, and of their own comrades of the 110th Brigade on their
right, rescued them from a desperate situation. Their work had been exceedingly
useful, as their presence had partially paralysed the whole German system of
defence. Great credit in this remarkable affair was due not only to General
Campbell and his staff, upon whom the initial responsibility lay, but to the
gallant and inspiring leading of General McCulloch and of the battalion
leaders, Holroyd Smith and Greenwood. It was indeed a wonderful feat to advance
three miles over such country upon a pitch-dark night and to reach and hold an
objective which was outflanked on both sides by the successful German defence.
The troops had been heartened up by messages with promises of speedy succour
which were dropped by aeroplanes during the day.</p>
<p>The 62nd Brigade had now pushed in between the 64th on the right and the
Forty-second Division on the left, touching the latter in the neighbourhood of
Pys, so that by the late afternoon of August 24 the whole line was solid and
the crossing of the Ancre with the capture of the ridge were accomplished
facts. There have been few more deft pieces of work in the war. The German
fixed line had been driven back and the remaining operations consisted from
this date onwards in a pursuit rather than an attack. It was a pursuit,
however, where the retreat was always covered by an obstinate rearguard, so
that there was many a stiff fight in front of the Fifth Corps in the days to
come.</p>
<p>Divisions had been instructed that the pursuit was to be continued in a
relentless fashion, and Corps cavalry, drawn from the 8th and 20th Hussars,
were told off to throw out patrols and keep in close touch with the German
rearguard. The immediate objectives of the infantry were Longueval and Flers
for the Welshmen, Gueudecourt for the Seventeenth, and Beaulencourt for the
Twenty-first Division. The general movement was extraordinarily like the
advance in the spring of 1917, but the British were now more aggressive and the
Germans were less 'Measured and sedate in their dispositions. On August 25 the
pressure was sustained along the whole line, and the Germans, fighting hard
with their machine-guns which swept the exposed ridges, were none the less
being pushed eastwards the whole day. The Welsh took Contalmaison and reached
the edge of Mametz Wood, where so many of their comrades had fallen just two
years before. The Seventeenth, fighting hard, captured Courcelette and
Martinpuich. The Twenty-first got Le Sars and the Butte de Warlencourt, that
strange old tumulus which now marked the joining point with the Fourth Corps
still advancing on the left. At no point was there a battle and at no point was
there peace, but a constant ripple of fire rose and fell along the thin
fluctuating line. It is noted in the diaries of some of the British Generals as
being the first day of purely open warfare in offensive fighting which their
troops had ever experienced.</p>
<p>On the morning of August 26 the Welsh overran Bazentin-le-Grand, but the
115th Brigade were held up for a time at the old stumbling-block High Wood.
Later in the day it was taken, however, while the 113th Brigade got as far as
the edge of Longueval, meeting, a severe counter-attack which was rolled back
in ruin by rifles and machine-guns. The Seventeenth Division gained some
ground, but both brigades, the 51st and 52nd, were held up by a withering fire
before reaching Flers. The 64th Brigade on their left met with equal opposition
and could not get forward. Everywhere there were signs of a strong German rally
for the evident purpose of covering the removal of their guns and stores. It
was well maintained and well organised, so that the object was attained. It
became clearer with every day that an artillery barrage was still a necessity
for an infantry advance.</p>
<p>On August 27 the advance was continued. Outside the Fifth Corps boundaries
the Fourth Corps on the left was encircling Bapaume and pushing advanced guards
on to Maplecourt and Fr&eacute;micourt, while Rawlinson's men on the right were
facing Trones Wood and the Guillemont Ridge. In the early morning, with a moon
shining brightly, the whole front of the Fifth Corps was on fire once more and
rolling eastwards. By 9 A.M. the 113th Brigade were through Longueval and in
touch with the Fourth Army near the Sugar Refinery. The 114th Brigade attempted
to pass north of Delville Wood, but after some confused fighting were held on
the line of the Flers&mdash;Longueval Road. Flers, however, had been taken by
the 50th Brigade, though the Germans made a strong fight of it and at one time
reoccupied the village. Whatever the general morale of the enemy may have been
there was no immediate weakening in the actual fighting power of his line. The
Twenty-first Division made only a moderate advance, but they got ahead of their
neighbours. The 6th Dragoon Guards, who were now furnishing the patrols, were
withdrawn, as it was clear that the Germans meant to stand.</p>
<p>On the morning of August 28 they were still in position, and the day was
mainly devoted to reorganising the infantry and bombarding the German lines,
together with all the roads which lay eastwards. Early next morning the Welsh
advanced once more, the 113th Brigade on one side of Delville Wood and the
114th on the other, with the result that this sinister graveyard was surrounded
and the line carried definitely to the east of it. Morval still held out, but
Lesboeufs was overrun. There was weakening all along the German line, which
meant no doubt that they had completed the withdrawal of their more essential
impedimenta. Flers and Gueudecourt both fell to the Seventeenth Division,
almost without a battle. The Twenty-first Division was also able to move
forward with no great difficulty as far as Beaulencourt and the line of the
road from that village to Bapaume. This new line was held with great
determination by the enemy, who were still, as must be admitted, masters of the
situation to the extent that though forced to retire they would still retire in
their own fashion. The Welsh attacking Morval that night found the place was
strongly held and no progress possible.</p>
<p>August 30 was to show that the German rearguards were by no means
demoralised and were not to be unduly hustled. It is impossible not to admire
the constancy in adversity of Hans and Fritz and Michel, whatever one may think
of the mentality of the Vons who had placed them in this desperate position.
Morval still held its own against the Welsh, and the Seventeenth Division could
not reach the clear line in front of them which is furnished by the
Peronne&mdash;Bapaume Road. Beaulencourt was also retained by the enemy, as the
patrols discovered to their cost. The line was still strong and menacing. There
was inaction on August 31, which was spent in bombardment and preparation.</p>
<p>At 2 A.M. on September 1 the Twenty-first Division attacked Beaulencourt and
carried it with a rush, and a strong attempt to regain it after dawn cost the
enemy heavy losses. During the morning the Welshmen on the right flank attacked
Morval and were at last successful in taking this strong position. There was
very heavy fighting all day round Sailly-Sallisel, where the 113th and 115th
Welsh Brigades made repeated efforts to envelop and capture the village. There
were several checks, but the gallant Welshmen stuck to their task, and before
evening the place had fallen and the general British line was well to the east
of it. On the other hand, the Seventeenth and Twenty-first Divisions had a bad
day in front of Le Transloy and the Sugar Factory, having nothing to show for
considerable losses, the 9th West Ridings being especially hard hit. None the
less the Seventeenth was hard at it again next morning, for it was imperative
to keep up the pressure without any relaxation. On this day, September 2, the
plan was that the 50th and 52nd Brigades should work round on each side of the
village while the artillery kept the defenders from interfering. This attack,
though delayed for some time, eventually succeeded, the 6th Dorsets clearing up
the ruins, while the Twenty-first Division, after several brave attempts, drove
the tenacious German garrison out of the Sugar Factory. The 10th West
Yorkshires, under Colonel Thomas, did particularly good work in linking up the
two divisions. Altogether it was a very satisfactory morning's work, and the
50th Brigade added to it in the evening by capturing in a fine attack the
village of Rocquigny, and pushing patrols on into Barastre, which was found to
be empty. On this day, as the Corps front had contracted, the Twenty-first
Division was drawn back into reserve. It may be remarked that in all these
operations Robertson's Seventeenth Division had the supreme satisfaction of
hurling the enemy out of a long series of villages which they had themselves
been forced to relinquish under the pressure of the great March advance.</p>
<p>It was clear now that the Germans, either of their own will or driven by the
constant pressure, were withdrawing their rearguards, so that in the early
morning of September 3 no touch could be gained by patrols. By 6 A.M. the
British advance guards were well on their way, streaming forward to the Canal
du Nord, from the eastern bank of which the eternal machine-guns were rapping
away once more, stopping the 50th Brigade in an attempt to make a direct
advance. There were no bridges left, so nothing further could be done that day,
which brought the corps front up to the western bank from Manancourt to the
north-east of Etricourt. On September 4, however, the crossing was effected
without any very great difficulty, and bridge-heads established by both the
divisions in the line.</p>
<p>On September 5 the 114th Brigade attacked the trench system round Equancourt
without success. The 51st Brigade had better luck to the north of the village
and gained a good bit of ground. The 7th Lincolns were held up with
considerable loss in the first advance on account of some misunderstanding
about the starting-point and insufficient touch with the Forty-second Division
on their left. The 7th Borders, a battalion made up of Cumberland and
Westmoreland Yeomanry, carried on the attack and found the village deserted.
The day ended with the right flank of the Fifth Corps in touch with the Third
Corps to the north-west of Nurlu, while the left flank joined the Fourth Corps
north of Vallulart Wood. That night the Twenty-first Division came back into
line, taking the place of the Welshmen who had done such splendid and strenuous
service since August 22.</p>
<p>September 6 and 7 were occupied in a slow but steady advance which absorbed
Equancourt, Fins, and Sorel-le-Grand. On September 8 matters were less
one-sided, as the Twenty-first Division, acting in close liaison with Rawlinson
at Peizi&egrave;res, attacked Vaucelette Farm and Chapel Crossing. It must have
been with peculiar ardour and joy that General Campbell and his men flung
themselves upon the positions which they had held so heroically upon March 21.
Here after six months were their complete vindication and revenge. The fighting
was carried on into September 9, the Seventeenth Division joining in on the
left in close touch with the New Zealanders of the Fourth Corps. It was clear
that the Germans meant standing if they could and the struggle was a very hard
one, but before evening much of the ground had reverted to the two divisions
which were both, by a peculiar coincidence, more or less in their old
positions. There were attack and counter-attack, and a good price paid for all
that was gained. There are days when land is cheap and days when it is the
dearest thing upon earth. At the end of this fight the Germans were in a
continuous trench on one side of the ridge and the British in a corresponding
position on the other. It became more and more clear that the days of pursuit
and rearguard actions were over, and that the whole British front in this
quarter was up against a fixed battle position of the enemy&mdash;or at the
least against the strong outposts in front of a fixed battle position. This
important fact regulates the whole situation up to the great attack of
September 29.</p>
<p>September 10 and 11 were spent in local encounters in the Chapel Crossing
and Vaucelette Farm district, the Germans striving hard by these outpost
engagements to prevent the British line from getting within striking distance
of the old Hindenburg position, behind which they hoped to rally their
dishevelled forces. The British were equally eager to break down this screen
and get at the solid proposition behind it. The weather was terrible, rising at
one time to the height of a cyclone, which disarranged the assembly. On
September 12 there was a more serious British advance, the Fourth Corps on the
left attacking the Trescault Spur, while the Welsh, who had now relieved the
Seventeenth Division, were to go forward on their flank. The Germans clung
desperately to their ground, however, and after a long day of alternate advance
and retreat the British line was where it had been in the morning. A position
called African Trench lay in front of the Welshmen, and it was not possible to
carry it in face of the very severe machine-gun fire. From this date until
September 18 there was no advance and no change on the front of the Fifth Corps
save that Pinney's Thirty-third Division came in to patch its worn array.</p>
<p>On September 18 the Fifth Corps attacked once more in conjunction with
Rawlinson's Army on its right, the final objective being the trench lines south
of Villers-Guislain&mdash;Gauche Wood. The advance was made by the Welsh
Division opposite to Gouzeaucourt, the Seventeenth in front of Gauche Wood, and
the Twenty-first to the immediate south. It was preceded by field barrage,
heavy barrage, machine barrage, trench mortar bombardment, and every refinement
of artillery practice as elaborated in this long war. The results of a hard
day's fighting were rather mixed. The Welsh Division was held near Gouzeaucourt
and finished up in its own original line, leaving the left flank of the 52nd
Brigade exposed. The two other divisions were able, after hard fighting, to
reach their objectives, including Gauche Wood. The Twenty-first Division had a
particularly trying and yet successful day, all three brigades being heavily
engaged and enduring considerable losses in capturing the very ground which
they had held on March 21. Their advance was complicated by a mine-field, laid
down by themselves and so well laid that it was still in a very sensitive
condition, while the dug-outs had been so undisturbed that the 1st Lincolns
actually found their own orderly papers upon the table. In the fighting the
62nd Brigade led the way with complete success, and it was not until the 64th
and the 110th Brigades passed through it and began to debouch over the old No
Man's Land that the losses became serious, Ep&eacute;hy and Peizi&egrave;res
being thorns in their flesh. Colonel Holroyd Smith of the 15th Durhams was
killed, but the 64th Brigade made good its full objective, the 1st East Yorks
capturing a German howitzer battery, together with the horses which had just
been hooked in. At one time the Germans got round the left flank of the
Division and the situation was awkward, but Colonel Walsh of the 9th Yorks
Light Infantry, with his H.Q. Staff, made a dashing little attack on his own,
and drove the enemy back, receiving a wound in the exploit. The Twenty-first
Division, save on the right, had all its objectives. The left of the Third
Corps had not prospered equally well, so that a defensive line had to be built
up by Campbell in the south, while Robertson did the same in the north, the
whole new position forming a marked salient. Two efforts of the enemy to regain
the ground were beaten back. The southern divisions had been much troubled by
flanking fire from Gouzeaucourt, so an effort was made that night to get
possession of this place, the 6th Dorsets and 10th West Yorkshires of the 50th
Brigade suffering in the attempt. This attack was led by General Sanders, who
had succeeded Gwyn, Thomas as Brigadier of the 50th, but he was himself killed
by a shell on September 20. Some 2000 prisoners and 15 field-guns were the
trophies taken in this operation by the Fifth Corps. Gouzeaucourt was shortly
afterwards evacuated, but there was no other change on the front until the
great battle which shattered the Hindenburg Line and really decided the war.
All of this fighting, and especially that on September 18, has to be read in
conjunction with that already narrated in the story of the Fourth Army on the
right.</p>
<p>Having brought Shute's Fifth Corps up to the eve of the big engagement we
shall now ask the reader to cast his mind back to August 21, the first day of
General Byng's advance, and to follow Haldane's Sixth Corps on the northern
flank of the Army during these same momentous and strenuous weeks. It will then
be more easy to trace the operations of Harper's Fourth Corps, which was
intermediate between Shute and Haldane.</p>
<p>Haldane's Sixth Corps, like its comrades of the Third Army, had gone through
the arduous days of March and had many a score to pay back to the Germans. It
was a purely British Corps, consisting upon the first day of battle of five
fine divisions, the Second (Pereira), Third (Deverell), Sixty-second
(Braithwaite), Fifty-ninth (Whigham), and the Guards. With four Regular units
out of five, Haldane's Sixth Corps might have been the wraith of the grand old
Mons army come back to judgment. The First Cavalry Division, also reminiscent
of Mons, was in close support, ready to take advantage of any opening.</p>
<p>The first advance in the early morning was made by the 99th Brigade of the
Second Division on the south, and the 2nd Guards Brigade on the north, the
latter being directed upon the village of Moyenneville, while the 99th Brigade
was to carry Moyblain Trench, the main German outpost position, 1000 yards in
front of the line. The right of the line was formed by the 1st Berks and the
left by the 23rd Royal Fusiliers, the latter having a most unpleasant start, as
they were gas-shelled in their assembly places and had to wear their masks for
several hours before zero time. Any one who has worn one of these contrivances
for five consecutive minutes will have some idea what is meant by such an
ordeal, and how far it prepares a man for going into battle. Only a very expert
man can keep the goggles clean, and one is simultaneously gagged, blinded, and
half smothered, with a horrible death awaiting any attempt at amelioration.</p>
<p>At five o'clock nine tanks moved forward behind a crashing stationary
barrage, and the infantry followed eagerly through a weak German fire. In spite
of all precautions the Fusiliers had lost 400 men from gas, but otherwise the
casualties were very small. It may be remarked that many of these serious gas
cases occurred from the reek of the gas out of the long grass when the sun
dried the dew, showing how subtle and dangerous a weapon is this distillation
of mustard. Some small consolation could be gained by the British soldier
suffering from these hellish devices, by the knowledge that our chemists,
driven to retaliate, had in mustard gas, as in every other poison, produced a
stronger brew than the original inventor. Well might the German garrison of
Lens declare that they wished they could have dropped that original inventor
into one of his own retorts.</p>
<p>The advance of the Guards kept pace on the left with that of the Second
Division. The 2nd Brigade went forward with Moyenneville for its immediate
objective. The 1st Coldstream in the north were to carry the village, while the
1st Scots were to assemble in the low ground north of Ayette, and to carry the
attack to the Ablainzeville-Moyenneville Ridge. The 3rd Grenadiers were then to
pass through the Scots and to capture the line of the railway. The opening of
the attack was much the same as in the case of the troops on the right, save
that no difficulty was experienced from gas. There were few losses in the two
leading battalions, which took many prisoners, and it was only the 3rd
Grenadiers who, as they neared the railway, met a good deal of machine-gun
fire, but pushed on in spite of it and made good the line of their
objective.</p>
<p>In the meantime the 9th Brigade of the Third Division had moved through the
ranks of the 99th Brigade, and had carried on the advance in the southern area.
They advanced with the 1st Northumberland Fusiliers on the right and 4th Royal
Fusiliers behind them. The latter had the misfortune to lose Colonel Hartley
and 50 men from a shell-burst while moving into position. The left front of the
brigade was formed by the 13th King's Liverpools. The whole line advancing in
open order passed on without a check, save from mist which caused loss of
direction and constant reference to the compass. Over a series of trenches the
line plodded its way, clearing up occasional machine-guns and their crews. By
9.15 they were on the railway embankment.</p>
<p>The 8th Brigade (Fisher) of the Third Division had also advanced on the left
of the 9th, keeping pace with it so far as the fog would allow. The 7th
Shropshires were on the left, in touch with the Guards. The 1st Scots Fusiliers
were on the right and the 2nd Royal Scots in support. The attack was directed
upon Courcelles, which was carried by the Scots Fusiliers and mopped up by the
8th Royal Lancasters. From the village a sharp slope leads down to the railway
line and here the opposition was very strong, the ground being closely swept by
rifle and machine-gun fire. Behind two tanks the leading battalions rushed
forward and the railway was rushed, with 200 prisoners. The position was
organised, and touch established with the Guards on the left and with the 9th
Brigade on the right. The 9th Brigade found it difficult, however, to get touch
with the Sixty-third Naval Division on their right, that unit having
experienced considerable difficulties and losses. The 76th Brigade, the
remaining unit of the Third Division, had the 2nd Suffolks and 1st Gordons
close up to the line, and all of these battalions were much mixed up owing to
the persistent fog.</p>
<p>A very determined pocket of German infantry and machine-gunners had remained
in front of the left flank of the Sixty-third Division, formed by the 188th
Brigade. These men were now on the right rear of the 9th Brigade, but the
situation was obscure and nothing was certain save that the British line was
not yet continuous and solid. In spite of a concentration of artillery the
Germans were still holding out next morning, being the only hostile units to
the west of the railway line on the Sixth Corps sector.</p>
<p>An attempt had been made to get forward to Achiet-le-Grand, in which part of
the Sixty-third Division on the right and two companies of the Gordons
participated. The Ansons and the Gordons both lost considerably in this attack
and were unable to reach the village, though they advanced the line by 500
yards. Lack of artillery support, while the enemy guns were numerous and
active, was the cause of the check.</p>
<p>The night of August 21 was quiet on most parts of this new front of the
Third Army, but at early dawn a counter-attack developed before the Sixty-third
Division and before the 8th Brigade. An S.O.S. barrage was called for and
promptly given in each case, which entirely extinguished the attack upon the
Sixty-third. On the 8th Brigade front some of the German infantry got as far
forward as the railway line but were quickly hurled back again by bombs and the
bayonet. At 7.45 A.M. the enemy again made a rush and occupied one post of the
railway, from which, as well as from the posts on the right of the 9th Brigade
where the railway line was not yet in British hands, he enfiladed the front
defences during the day, causing many casualties, until in the evening the post
was retaken by the 1st Northumberland Fusiliers. Among the gas cases sent to
the rear this day, though his injuries had been incurred during the assembly,
was General Fisher of the 8th Brigade.</p>
<p>The Guards in the north had also encountered the attack of the early morning
of August 22, which seems to have been general along the line, though at no
part very vigorous. This particular section of it was delivered near
Hamelincourt by the Fortieth Saxon Division, who suffered terribly in the
venture. The rest of the day was comparatively quiet and was spent in arranging
the attack for the morrow. This attack was planned with the idea of outflanking
the German position at Achiet-le-Grand, which had shown itself to be
dangerously strong. It was determined to outflank it both upon the north and
the south. With this intention the Third Division was to capture Gomiecourt
during the night of August 22. Farther north two fresh divisions, the famous
Fifty-sixth London Territorials, and the Fifty-second from Palestine, were
ordered to prolong the line of the Guards, all under General Haldane, and to
capture Hamelincourt, Boyelles, and Boiry Becquerelle, with as much more as
they could get, on the early morning of August 23. On the front of the Fourth
Corps on the right the advance was entrusted to the Thirty-seventh Division and
to the Forty-second Division on the bank of the Ancre.</p>
<p>The attack upon Gomiecourt, which was to be the prelude of the day's work,
since all advance to the south was impossible while that village was in German
hands, was carried out by the well-tried 76th Brigade, the 8th Royal Lancasters
and 2nd Suffolks in the front line, with the 1st Gordons in close support.
Tanks were to lead the van, but they were unable to get across the railway
embankment in time. The assault, which began at 4 in the morning, was preceded
by a short crashing bombardment of heavy shells upon the doomed village. It had
hardly ceased before the Suffolks and Lancasters were swarming down the street,
and the place was secured with little loss. Whilst this brisk and successful
affair was going on, the 13th King's Liverpools of the 9th Brigade on the right
made an advance to keep the line level, taking some prisoners and three guns.
This was the more important as the weak point of the situation had always been
to the south and most of the damage sustained was by enfilade fire from this
direction.</p>
<p>The 8th Brigade, now under the command of Colonel Henderson, kept pace with
the 76th Brigade in their advance, occupying the ground north of Gomiecourt.
The 2nd Royal Scots and 7th Shropshires were in the lead. There was very heavy
fire and the losses were considerable, but the machine-gun nests were rooted
out with the bayonet, and the full objective was attained. Farther north the
attack was carried on by the 3rd Grenadier Guards and the 1st Scots. These were
successful in taking the village of Hamelincourt and the trench system south of
it, while keeping in touch with the Fifty-sixth Division to the north of them.
The 1st Coldstream was then pushed through and crossed the Arras&mdash;Bapaume
Road, gaining a position eventually from which they looked south upon
Ervillers.</p>
<p>Farther north still both the Fifty-sixth and the Fifty-second Divisions had
joined in the advance, moving forward to the line of the great high road which
runs from north to south. Bridges had been thrown over the Cojeul River by the
sappers of the Fifty-ninth Division, who had held this front&mdash;the workers
having to wear gas masks during their labours. To the 470th Field Company R.E.
belongs the credit of this most difficult job, under the direction of Colonel
Coussmaker. Over these bridges passed the Fifty-second Division, while south of
them the attack was urged by the 168th Brigade of the Fifty-sixth Division,
with several villages for their objective. The 13th London (Kensingtons) were
on the right, the 4th London in the centre, and the 14th London (London
Scottish) on the left. The advance went without a hitch, save that touch was
lost with the Guards on the right. This was regained again in the evening,
however, when the Brigade found itself to the north of Croisilles and close to
the old Hindenburg Line. The Fifty-second Division had also reached the line
where it runs across the Sens&eacute;e valley.</p>
<p>The main advance in front of Haldane's Corps had been entrusted to the
Second Division, who advanced through the ranks of the Third Division after the
capture of Gomiecourt. This advance was on a three-brigade front. On the right
was the 99th Brigade, in touch with the 63rd Brigade of the Thirty-seventh
Division to the south of them. This Brigade was told off to keep the flank, but
it captured 500 prisoners in the process. On the left was the 6th Brigade,
which had been ordered, with the help of eight whippets, to attack Ervillers.
In the centre the 5th Brigade with ten whippets was to carry Behagnies and
Sapignies. This considerable attack was timed for 11 o'clock.</p>
<p>Gomiecourt having fallen, the 5th Brigade used it as a screen, passing round
to the north of it and then turning south to Behagnies. The 2nd Highland Light
Infantry headed for that village, while the 24th Royal Fusiliers advanced to
the storm of Sapignies. The 2nd Oxford and Bucks were in reserve. The ten light
tanks which led tie attack had a series of adventures. Three were knocked out
by a gun on the railway. The other seven under heavy gun-fire swerved to the
right, got out of the divisional area, and on the principle that any fight is
better than no fight, joined with the Thirty-seventh Division in their attack
upon Achiet-le-Grand, where they did good service. In the meantime, the
tankless 5th Brigade moved round Gomiecourt, coming under very heavy fire on
their left flank. Colonel Brodie, a most gallant V.C. officer of the Highland
Light Infantry, was killed, and Colonel Cross of the Oxfords wounded, by this
fire. The day was very hot, the men exhausted, and the losses severe. The new
position was organised, therefore, and the advance suspended for the
present.</p>
<p>The 6th Brigade had advanced on the left of the 5th, heading for Ervillers,
with the let King's Liverpools and the 2nd South Staffords in the lead. The
front waves, assisted by light tanks, rapidly broke down all opposition, and
Ervillers was taken about 2 P.M. All movement beyond the village was checked by
very heavy fire from the high ground to the north-east, so that Mory Copse, the
next objective, was found to be unattainable. The object of the British
Commanders was never to pay more for a position than it was worth, or buy a
machine-gun at the cost of half a battalion. On the other hand, papers captured
during the day showed beyond all doubt that the object of the Germans was to
make an orderly retreat as far as the Hindenburg Line, so that it was clearly
the game to hustle and bustle them without cessation.</p>
<p>August the 24th was a heavy day in the Sixth Corps, who were ordered to push
on and gain ground to the utmost extent along the whole front. In order to
strengthen the movement, the Canadian Corps had been very quietly and deftly
removed from the right wing of Rawlinson's Army and transferred to the left
wing of Byng's Army, in touch with the Fifty-second Division.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that the Second Division, though they had taken
Ervillers, had been pinned down there by German fire, while they had failed to
take Behagnies or Sapignies. Both these movements were now resumed. In the
night of August 23-24 the 1st King's Liverpools advanced from Ervillers upon
Mory, but were held up by very heavy fire. The 3rd Guards Brigade on the north
was advancing successfully upon St. Leger and this had the effect of
outflanking the Mory position on that side. St. Leger was taken by the 2nd
Scots Guards and the 1st Welsh, who cleared it in the course of the afternoon.
They could get no farther, however, until the Second Division had completed its
task at Mory. This was now in the hands of the 99th Brigade, who, headed by the
1st Berkshires, with the 1st Royal Rifles behind them, and a spearhead of tanks
in front, broke down all opposition and captured Mory Copse, a very formidable
position full of emplacements and dug-outs. By this success the threat was
removed from the right of the Guards, and all was clear for their further
advance upon Ecoust.</p>
<p>The Sixty-second Yorkshire Division had now moved up to relieve the Second
Division, but the latter were determined before their withdrawal to complete
their unfinished tasks. In the early morning of August 25 the attacks upon the
two obdurate villages were resumed, after a very heavy bombardment. The new
venture was splendidly successful. The 2nd Highland Light Infantry and the 24th
Royal Fusiliers rushed into Behagnies while it was still dark and cleared out
the whole village. This enabled the force to get to the rear of Sapignies,
which was stormed by the 2nd Oxfords&mdash;a battalion with such proud
traditions that even now in semi-official documents it is still the 52nd Light
Infantry. 300 prisoners and 150 machine-guns were taken in the village, a
proportion which illustrates how far machines were taking the places of men in
the depleted German Army. Haring gloriously tidied up its front the Second
Division now stood out while the Sixty-second took its place.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that the Fifty-second and Fifty-sixth Divisions had
fought their way to the Hindenburg Line on August 23. This was too formidable
an obstacle to be taken in their stride, and the most that could be hoped was
that they should get into a good position for the eventual attack. The
Fifty-second Division had shown the metal of the Palestine Army by a very fine
advance which made them masters of Henin. On their right was the 167th Brigade,
with the 1st London and the 7th and 8th Middlesex in the line. These troops
pushed right into the outskirts of Croisilles, but it was clear that new German
divisions were in the line, and that the resistance had very much hardened. The
Londoners were unable to hold the village, and the Fifty-second Division was
also held up on Henin Hill by very strong fire. Matters seemed to have come to
a stand in that quarter.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of the 25th the Guards 3rd Brigade and the 186th and
the 187th Brigades of the Sixty-second Division made a resolute advance to
clear their front and get nearer to that terrible paling which was meant to
enclose the German domain. It was a day of very hard fighting for all three
brigades, and they had ample evidence that the German line had indeed been
powerfully reinforced, and had no intention of allowing General Byng to
establish himself in the very shadow of their fortifications if they could hold
him off. The opening was inauspicious, for by some mistake there was an error
of half an hour in starting-time between the two divisions. As a result the
Guards found themselves on the line of road between Mory and St. Leger with an
open flank and under heavy enfilade fire, which made many gaps in the ranks of
the 1st Grenadiers. At the same time the leading tanks were put out of action
on that flank. In the centre the tanks lost their way in the mist, but the 2nd
Scots Guards pushed ahead in spite of it. Banks Trench, however, in front of
them was very strongly held and the assault was not pressed. On the left the
1st Welsh were in St. Leger Wood, but Croisilles was still untaken and the
advance could not be carried forward as the machine-guns from this village
swept the country. About 9 A.M. the enemy buzzed out of the Hindenburg Line and
fell upon the Scots Guards, but were shot back again into their cover. During
these operations the Guards captured a battery of field-guns.</p>
<p>The Sixty-second West Yorkshire Territorials on the right of the Guards had
an equally arduous day. They had found the same difficulties in getting
forward, but at 5 P.M. the enemy had the indiscretion to counter-attack, and
when once he masks his own machine-guns he has ceased to be formidable. His
attack was near Mory Copse and aimed at the junction between the two divisions,
but it was heavily punished and shredded away to nothing. About 7 P.M. he tried
another advance upon the right of the Sixty-second Division and won his way up
to the line, but was thrown out again by the 5th West Ridings and driven
eastward once more. The 186th Brigade, forming the right of the division,
co-operated with the Fourth Corps in their attack upon Favreuil, which place
was captured.</p>
<p>On the evening of August 25 Haldane's Sixth Corps, which had become somewhat
unwieldy in size, was limited to the north on a line just south of Croisilles,
so that the Fifty-second, Fifty-sixth, and Fifty-seventh Divisions all became
Fergusson's Seventeenth Corps, which was thus thrust between the Sixth Corps
and the Canadians, who had not yet made their presence felt upon this new
battle-ground. The Seventeenth Corps was now the left of the Third Army, and
the Canadians were the right of the First Army. The immediate task of both the
Sixth and Seventeenth Corps was the hemming in and capture of Croisilles, and
the reoccupation of the old army front line. August 26 was a quiet day on this
front, but on August 27 the Guards and the Sixty-second Division were ordered
forward once more, the former to attack Ecoust and Longatte, the other to storm
Vaulx-Vraucourt. The First German Division encountered was easily driven in.
The second, however, the Thirty-sixth, was made in a sterner mould and was
supported by a strong artillery, large and small. The 2nd Grenadiers and 2nd
Coldstream in the front line of the Guards 1st Brigade got forward for nearly a
mile on each flank, but were held up by a withering fire in the centre, so that
the flanks had eventually to come back. The Fifty-sixth Division of the
Seventeenth Corps had not yet captured Croisilles, from which a counter-attack
was made upon the left flank of the 2nd Coldstream, which was handsomely
repulsed.</p>
<p>On the whole, however, it had been an unsatisfactory day and the
Sixty-second had been equally unable to get forward, so that none of the
objectives had been gained. The Seventeenth Corps and the Canadians in the
north were both advancing, however, and it was possible that the position in
the south might alter as a consequence.</p>
<p>Such was indeed found to be the case on August 28, for the Fifty-sixth
Division was able this day to get possession of Croisilles, which eased the
situation to the south. The Guards and the Sixty-second pushed forwards,
following always the line of least resistance, so that by evening they were
1200 yards forward at some points, though the right of the Sixty-second
Division was still pinned to its ground. That evening the Third Division
replaced the Guards, and the same tactics were pursued on the following day.
The 76th Brigade was now in the front line to the south of Croisilles, with the
hard-worked Sixty-second Division still on their right. A sugar factory was the
chief impediment in front of the latter. The right of the division got forward
during the day and occupied the old army trenches.</p>
<p>August 30 was once again a day of heavy fighting, the Seventeenth and Sixth
Corps, represented by the Fifty-sixth, Third, and Sixty-second Divisions,
closing in upon the Hindenburg Line and attacking the last villages which
covered its front. The tanks had miscarried, and the infantry at 5 A.M. had to
go forward alone. On the right the 185th and 186th Brigades of the Sixty-second
Division both made good progress, the obnoxious sugar factory was taken, and
though Vaulx could not be cleared it was partly occupied. Next day saw the dour
Yorkshiremen still sticking to their point, and fighting with varying success
in and out of the village. At times they had flooded through it, and yet again
they were beaten back. By the morning of September 1 the 186th Brigade had
possession of Vaulx-Vraucourt and were on the high ground to the east of the
village. Next morning they had Vaux Trench as well, but about ten o'clock in
the forenoon of September 2 a strong counter sent them reeling back in some
disorder. Gathering themselves together in grim North Country fashion they went
forward again and cleared Vaulx Wood before evening. That night, after a very
desperate and costly term of service, the Sixty-second was relieved by the
Second Division.</p>
<p>The experiences of the Third Division from the August 30 attack were as
arduous as those already described. On that morning the 76th Brigade, with the
Suffolks and Gordons in the lead, got forward well at the first, though they
lost touch with the Londoners to the north. The Suffolks were on that side and
the gap enabled the Germans to get round to their left rear with disastrous
results, as the losses were heavy and the battalion had to fall back. The
Gordons had to adjust their line accordingly. This rebuff had lost most of the
ground which had been gained early in the day, General Deverell now sent up the
9th Brigade, as the 76th was much worn, but the 1st Gordons remained in the
fight.</p>
<p>On August 31 the 9th Brigade attacked the Vraucourt position, with the 1st
Gordons, battle-weary but still indomitable, on the right, the 4th Royal
Fusiliers in the centre, and the 13th King's Liverpools on the left. It was
known that no less than three new German divisions had been thrown in, and
however the fighting might turn it was certain that the attrition was going
merrily forward. The assembly was unfortunately much disturbed by the German
barrage, which fell with particular severity upon the Fusiliers in the centre.
At 5.15 A.M. the line moved forward, but again the luck was against the
Fusiliers, who were opposed by a particularly dangerous machine-gun nest in a
sunken road. One company endeavoured to rush it, but all the officers save one,
and most of the men, were mown down. A tank which endeavoured to help them met
with a strange fate, as a German officer managed, very gallantly, to get upon
the top of it, and firing through the ventilation hole with his revolver, put
the whole crew out of action&mdash;a feat for which in the British service he
would certainly have had his V.C.</p>
<p>The Fusiliers were hung up, but the King's on the left had carried the
village of Ecoust, getting in touch with the right of the Fifty-sixth Division
in Bullecourt Avenue. Many hundreds of the enemy were taken, but some pockets
still remained on the southern edge of the village, and fired into the flank of
the unfortunate Fusiliers. The King's then attempted during the long day to
throw out their right flank and get in touch with the left of the Gordons so as
to obliterate the sunken road, which was the centre of the mischief. The ground
was absolutely open, however, and the fire commanded it completely. Under these
circumstances Colonel Herbert of the 1st Northumberland Fusiliers, which was in
reserve, suggested that the attack be postponed until dusk. This was done, and
at 8 P.M. Herbert's men overran the sunken road, capturing the guns. Ecoust was
also completely cleared of the enemy. So ended this day of vicissitudes in
which the 9th Brigade, with heavy loss, had struggled through many difficulties
and won their victory at the last. A further advance during the night by both
the 9th and the 76th Brigades straightened the whole line from Ecoust to the
south.</p>
<p>On the morning of September 1 the Fifty-second Division had relieved the
Fifty-sixth Division, both of the Seventeenth Corps, in the Croisilles sector,
and was in close touch with the Third Division to the south. Both divisions
went forward with no great difficulty at the appointed hour, the three
battalions of the 9th Brigade being all in the line once more. The important
trench known as Noreuil Switch was captured in this advance. It may well seem
to the reader that the gains were tardily and heavily bought at this stage of
the operations, but it is to be always borne in mind that Fergusson and Haldane
in particular were up against the old intricate trench system, and away from
that open fighting which can alone give large results. To others there was
always some way round, but here there was an unbroken obstacle which must be
frontally attacked and broken down by pure persistence. In these operations the
new machine-gun organisation proved to be particularly efficient, and B Company
of the 3rd Battalion Machine-Gun Corps did essential work in winning the way
for the 9th Brigade. The whole battle was a long steady contest of endurance,
in which the Germans were eventually worn out by the persistence of their
opponents.</p>
<p>The advance was renewed along this area on September 2, the object of the
Fifty-second Division being to encircle Qu&eacute;ant from the south and west,
while that of the Third and Sixty-second Divisions was to gain the east of
Lagnicourt and the high ground east of Morchies. The fortunes of the
Sixty-second Division have already been briefly described. On the front of the
Third Division the 8th Brigade, strengthened by one battalion from each of the
other brigades, took up the heavy task, the 7th Shropshires, 2nd Royal Scots,
and 1st Scots Fusiliers forming from right to left the actual line of battle.
The last-named battalion by a happy chance joined up on the left with its own
5th Battalion in the Fifty-second Division. They assembled under heavy
shelling, some of which necessitated the use of box-respirators. No sooner had
the advance begun than the Shropshire men came under machine-gun fire and lost
the three tanks which led them. They had gained some ground, but were first
brought to a halt and then compelled to retire. In the centre the Royal Scots
took Noreuil, which was found to be lightly held. In attempting to get on to
the east of this village they found the trenches strongly manned and the fire,
both of rifles and machine-guns, so murderous that it was impossible to get
forward. The Scots Fusiliers were also faced with strong resistance, including
a belt of wire. Three company and eight platoon commanders were down before
this obstacle and the sunken road behind it were crossed. Without the aid of
tanks the depleted battalion moved on under very heavy fire, and eventually
halted in a line with the Royal Scots on their right. To the right of these, as
already shown, the Sixty-second Division had also been brought to a stand. A
formidable trench, called in the old British days Macaulay Avenue, barred the
way and had only been reached by a few of the assailants. It is a fact,
however, that Lieutenant R. R. MacGregor of the Scots Fusiliers with five men
did force their way in upon this morning, and tenaciously held on to their
position until after dark, forming just that little nucleus of determined men
by whom great battles are so often won.</p>
<p>There was a momentary check, but it was retrieved by Captain Nagle's company
of the 2nd Suffolks, who charged with two companies of the Royal Scots and won
a section of the trench. The utmost difficulty was experienced by the Brigadier
in keeping in touch with the action, as the ground was so exposed that nearly
every runner sent back from the front line was killed or wounded. Colonel
Henderson came forward, therefore, about three o'clock and reorganised his
dispositions, with the result that before evening the line had been
straightened and advanced, with the capture of many prisoners and machine-guns.
Meanwhile Qu&eacute;ant to the north had been captured by the Fifty-second
Division, and the whole German system of defence was weakening and crumbling,
the Seventeenth Corps strongly co-operating with the Canadians upon their left.
The enemy's purpose during all this very hard contest was to sacrifice his
rearguards if necessary, in order to cover the retreat of his main body across
the Canal du Nord. There were few more difficult problems in local fighting
during the whole war than how to carry these successive positions, bravely held
and bristling with machine-guns. That it was finally done was a great
achievement upon the part both of those who commanded and those who obeyed.
Colonel Vickery's guns, covering the infantry, had much to do with the final
success. How great that success was could only be judged upon the following
morning when the new divisions which had taken over the front, the Guards on
the left and the Second on the right, found that all the kick had been taken
out of the Germans, and that a substantial advance could be made with little
loss.</p>
<p>Neither the Guards nor the Third Division encountered serious opposition
upon September 3, and a steady, if cautious, forward movement went on all day.
The Seventeenth Corps upon the left had turned south in order to clear Moouvres
and Tadpole Copse. By midday the Second Division had cleared both Hermies and
Demicourt. Before evening the 2nd Guards Brigade was in the old British front
line, which was held during the night. The Canal du Nord was just ahead, and it
was realised that this would mark what the Germans intended to make their
permanent line. It was all-important to push the rearguard across it and to get
any bridges with their eastern exits, if it were in any way possible.</p>
<p>The advance on September 4 was resumed in the face of some sporadic
opposition, but by the evening of the 6th the enemy was all across the Canal,
and the Sixth Corps was awaiting developments elsewhere. On September 11 steps
were taken, however, to get into striking position for the final fracture of
the Hindenburg Line, in view of which it was necessary to gain the Hindenburg
front system west of the Canal. On September 12 the main attack was delivered,
though on September 11 the Second Division had secured the western ends of the
Canal crossings. The centre of the new operation was the attack upon
Havrincourt by Braithwaite's Sixty-second Division. This operation was carried
out by the 186th and 187th Brigades, the pioneer battalion, 9th Durham Light
Infantry, being attached to the former, while eight brigades of field-guns and
three groups of heavies lent their formidable assistance. The right of the
Sixty-second was in close touch with the Thirty-seventh Division, which was
attacking Trescault. The advance of both brigades was uninterrupted, though
strongly opposed. The 2/4th Hants and 5th West Ridings on the right, and the
2/4th York and Lancasters with the 5th Yorkshire Light Infantry on the left,
trampled down all opposition. The individual is almost lost to sight in the
scale of such operations, but a sentence must be devoted to Sergeant Calvert of
the last-named battalion, who attacked two machine-guns, bayoneted four and
shot three of the crews, taking the rest prisoners. At 7.30, the western edge
of the village of Havrincourt had fallen, but the fortified ch&acirc;teau on
the south, in the area of the 186th Brigade, still held its own. It was
attacked by the 2/4th West Riding Battalion, who had a most difficult task in
the tangled gardens which surrounded the house. At the same time the 2/4th
Hants pushed into the village and fought their way right through it. They had
to sustain a heavy counter-attack delivered about 7 in the evening by the
Twentieth Hanoverian Division, supported by a flight of low-flying aeroplanes.
This attack was broken up with great loss by the steady fire of the men of
Hampshire and Yorkshire.</p>
<p>In the early morning of September 13 the village was strongly attacked by
the enemy, who effected a lodgment in the cemetery and pushed back the British
line for 200 yards. A fine return was made by the 5th Devons of the 185th
Brigade, who cleared the village once again. Two of the divisional machine-guns
held out close to the posts occupied by the Germans&mdash;so close that the
sergeant in charge shot the battalion leader of the enemy with his revolver.
From this time the Sixty-second were left in possession of Havrincourt, which
they had thus won for the second time, since it was carried by them in the
Cambrai battle of November 20, 1917. General Braithwaite, who was the victor
upon each occasion, remarked that if his men had to take it a third time they
should, on the cup-tie principle, be allowed to keep it for ever.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Second Division on the left had made its way slowly but
without any serious check as far as London Trench, which brought them nearly
level with the Sixty-second, while the Thirty-seventh in the south had captured
Trescault and were also well up to the Hindenburg Line. There was no further
serious fighting for several days on this front save that the 185th Brigade
advanced its line to Triangle Wood on the morning of September 14. This attack
was carried out by the 2/20th Londons and was completely successful, as was
their subsequent defence against a brisk counter-attack. On September 16 the
Sixty-second Division was relieved by the Third, and the Second Division by the
Guards. There was no further fighting until September 18, that general day of
battle, when a very severe German attack was made about 6 o'clock in the
evening, which covered the whole front of the Third Division and involved the
left of the Thirty-seventh Division in the area of the Fourth Corps. After a
heavy bombardment there was a determined advance of infantry, having the
recapture of Havrincourt for its objective. A number of low-flying aeroplanes
helped the German infantry. The attack fell chiefly upon the 1st Scots
Fusiliers and 2nd Royal Scots, and some gain was effected by a rush of bombers
aided by flame-throwers, but they were finally held and eventually driven back,
while 100 prisoners were retained. C Company of the Royal Scots particularly
distinguished itself in this action, forming a solid nucleus of resistance
round which the whole defence was organised. Nothing further of importance
occurred until September 27, the day of the general advance, in this northern
portion of the British line.</p>
<p>In order to complete this account of the doings of Byng's Third Army from
August 21 onwards, some account must now be given of what was originally the
central unit, Harper's Fourth Corps, though its general progress has already
been roughly defined by the detailed desoription of the two Corps on its
flanks.</p>
<p>The first task set for this Corps on August 21 was to capture the general
line between Irles in the south and Bihucourt in the north, while the flank of
this main attack was to be guarded by a subsidiary advance along the valley of
the Ancre, and between Puisieux and Miraumont. The first objective of the main
attack was Bucquoy, Ablainzeville, and the important high ground to the
immediate east of these villages.</p>
<p>The advance commenced in a thick mist, and was undertaken in the case of the
main attack by Williams' Thirty-seventh English Division. It was completely
successful, and aided by the fire of six heavy and fifteen field brigades of
artillery, it swept over its first objectives, the tanks helping materially to
break down the opposition. The moral effect of a tank in a fog can be pictured
by the least imaginative. Two field-guns and many lighter pieces were taken.
The veteran Fifth Division on the right and the Sixty-third Naval Division on
the left then passed through the ranks of the Thirty-seventh to enlarge the
opening that they had made, carrying the advance on to the limit of the field
artillery barrage, and halting at last just west of Achiet-le-Petit. The naval
men met with a blaze of machine-gun fire from the edge of Logeast Wood, but
they rooted out the nests and occupied the position, though the passage through
the tangled brushwood and trees disorganised the units, and progress became
slow. The railway line ran right across the front, and this, as usual, had
become a formidable and continuous obstacle, which could not be turned. The
reserve brigade of the Fifth Division on the right carried Achiet-le-Petit, but
could not get over the railway. The Sixty-third was also unable to reach the
railway, and found a considerable concentration of Germans opposite to them in
the brickworks and cemetery west of Achiet-le-Grand. The tanks had wandered off
in the mist, and for the moment the advance had reached its limit. Many of the
tanks, as the mist lifted, were hit by the anti-tank guns of the enemy, though
some most gallantly crossed the railway line and penetrated the German
positions, doing such harm as they could, until they were eventually
destroyed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the subsidiary attack on the right flank had also been successful
up to a point. The New Zealanders on the immediate south of the Fifth Division
had gone forward in their usual workmanlike fashion, and had taken Puisieux.
Upon their right, and next to the Fifth Corps who were beginning their arduous
crossing of the Ancre, was the Forty-second Division (Solly-Flood), an
ex-Palestine unit of Lancashire Territorials which had won laurels in the March
fighting. It had come away with a flying start, and had got as far as the
important point named Beauregard Dovecote. There it remained until the early
morning of August 22, when the enemy regained it by a spirited attack from a
new division. The total effect of the day's work along the whole front of the
Fourth Corps had been the capture of 1400 prisoners, of a number of guns, and
of an extent of ground which was important, though less than had been hoped
for. The main resistance had always been the railway, and the German guns
behind it, so that to that extent his line was really inviolate. Indeed from
his point of view the whole work of the Third Army on that date might be
represented as an attack upon a false front, the real position remaining
intact.</p>
<p>The enemy was by no means abashed, and early in the morning of August 22 he
showed that he did not propose to surrender the field until he had fought to
regain it. At dawn the Fifty-second German Division deployed through Miraumont
and fell upon the left of the Fifth Division in one direction, and the
Forty-second in the other. As already stated they succeeded in driving back the
latter, and Beauregard Dovecote remained as a prize of victory. Some three
hundred Germans pushed through between the Fifth Division and the New
Zealanders, but were at once attacked by a party of the 1st Devons, assisted by
some of the New Zealanders. Corporal Onions of the Devons showed great
initiative in this affair, which ended in the capture of the whole of the
intruders. He received the V.C. for his gallantry.</p>
<p>It was a day of reaction, for the Sixty-third Division in the north was
strongly attacked, and was at one time pushed as far as Logeast Wood. They
rallied however and came back, but failed to regain the railway at
Achiet-le-Grand. Early in the morning of August 23 the Beauregard Dovecote was
finally captured by units of the Forty-second and New Zealanders, the enemy
falling back to Miraumont. About the same hour in the morning the Sixth Corps
in the north had taken Gomiecourt as already described, which strengthened the
general position.</p>
<p>Early on August 23 the Thirty-seventh Division came up on the left and
relieved the Naval Division. Guns had been pushed into position, so at it
o'clock in the forenoon it was possible to deliver a strong attack under an
adequate barrage upon the line of the railway. The result was a complete
success, in spite of the formidable nature of the defences. The imperturbable
English infantry flooded over every obstacle, took its inevitable losses with
its usual good humour, and established itself upon the farther side of the
position, while the tanks, taking advantage of a level crossing, burst through
and did very great work. Both Achiet-le-Grand and Bihucourt fell to the
Thirty-seventh Division, while the Fifth captured the high ground overlooking
Irles, and subsequently pushed on eastwards as far as Loupart Wood. Since
Miraumont was still German the flank of Ponsonby's Division was scourged by the
machine-guns, and an attempt by the Forty-second Division to relieve the
pressure by taking the village had no success, but the Fifth maintained all its
gains in spite of the heavy enfilading fire. In this fine operation the
Thirty-seventh Division alone captured 1150 prisoners. There were signs,
however, of German reaction, especially on the southern flank, where a new
division, the Third Naval, had been brought into line.</p>
<p>August 24 was another day of victory. The New Zealanders passed through the
depleted ranks of the Fifth Division and made good not only the whole of
Loupart Wood, but also Grevillers to the north-east of it. An even more useful
bit of work was the storming of Miraumont by the Forty-second Division in the
south. This village, which had been nearly surrounded by the advance on the
flanks, gave up 500 prisoners and several guns. The Forty-second continued its
career of victory to Pys, which they took, and were only stopped eventually by
the machine-guns at Warlencourt. This advance greatly relieved the situation on
the right flank, which had been a cause for anxiety, and it also, by winning a
way to the Ancre, solved the water problem, which had been a difficult one.
This day of continued victorious advance was concluded by the occupation of
Biefvillers by the united action of the Thirty-seventh and of the New
Zealanders.</p>
<p>At 5 A.M. upon August 25 the advance was resumed, with the Sixty-third
Division on the right, the New Zealanders in the centre, and the Thirty-seventh
on the left. The naval men found a head wind from the first, for the Germans
were holding Le Barque and Thilloy in great strength. No great progress could
be made. On the left the New Zealanders and the Thirty-seventh both reached the
very definite line of the Bapaume&mdash;Arras Road, where they were held by
very heavy fire from Bapaume on the right and Favreuil on the left. The
splendid Thirty-seventh, with some assistance from the New Zealanders on their
south, rushed the wood and village of Favreuil and helped to beat off a German
counter-attack by the fresh Hundred and eleventh Division, which was so mauled
by aircraft and artillery that it never looked like reaching its objective.
Many dead and some abandoned guns marked the line of its retirement.</p>
<p>On August 26 these indefatigable troops were still attacking. It was indeed
a most marvellous display of tenacity and will-power. The general idea was to
encircle Bapaume from the north and to reach the Cambrai Road. In this the
Fifth Division and the New Zealanders were successful, the former reaching
Beugnatre, while the latter got as far as the road, but sustained such losses
from machine-gun fire that they could not remain there. In the south Thilloy
still barred the advance of the Naval Division, which was again repulsed on
August 27, when they attacked after a heavy bombardment. There was a pause at
this period as the troops were weary and the supplies had been outdistanced. On
August 28 the Sixty-third left the Fourth Corps and the Forty-Second took over
their line and repeated their experience, having a setback before Thilloy. On
August 29 there was a general withdrawal of the German rear-guards, the whole
opposition dissolved, Thilloy fell to the Forty-second Division, and the New
Zealanders had the honour of capturing Bapaume. Up to this time the advance of
the Fourth Corps had yielded 100 guns and 6800 prisoners.</p>
<p>On August 30 the whistles were sounding once more and the whole British line
was rolling eastwards. It will mark its broader front if we say that on this
date the Fifth Corps on the right was in front of Beaulencourt, while the Sixth
Corps on the left had taken Vaulx, Vraucourt. The Forty-second Division on this
day was unable to hold Riencourt, but the rest of the line got well forward,
always fighting but always prevailing, until in the evening they were east of
Bancourt and Fr&eacute;micourt, and close to Beugny. Always it was the same
programme, the exploring fire, the loose infantry advance, the rapping
machine-guns, the quick concentration and rush&mdash;occasionally the summoning
of tanks or trench mortars when the strong point was obstinate. So the wave
passed slowly but surely on.</p>
<p>On August 31 the Germans, assisted by three tanks, made a strong attack upon
the New Zealanders, and a small force pushed in between them and the Fifth
Division. They were surrounded, however, a German battalion commander was shot
and some sixty of his men were taken. The whole line was restored. On this day
the Lancashire men on the right took Riencourt with some prisoners and a
battery of guns.</p>
<p>September 2 was a day of hard battle and of victory, the three Corps of
General Byng's Army attempting to gain the general line
Barastre&mdash;Haplincourt&mdash;Le Bucqui&egrave;re. The Forty-second Division
captured Villers-au-Flos and advanced east of it, while the New Zealanders made
good the ridge between there and Beugny. Some 600 prisoners were taken. There
was some very fierce fighting round Beugny in which the Fifth Division lost six
tanks and many men with no particular success. The place was afterwards
abandoned.</p>
<p>The British line was now drawing close to the Hindenburg position, and the
Fourth Corps like all the others was conscious of the increased effort which
the Germans were making in order to prevent the attackers from gaining all the
outlying posts, and being able to carry the main line before every preparation
had been made for its defence. For several days there were wrestles for this
position or that, which culminated on September 9 in a very sharp tussle
between the New Zealanders and a German Jaeger Division at African Trench on
the ridge west of Gouzeaucourt. It was a very desperate fight, which some of
the old New Zealanders declared to have been the most intense and close which
they had experienced since they met the Turks at Gallipoli&mdash;a compliment
to the Jaeger, but somewhat a reflection upon other units of the German army.
In the end the New Zealanders were unable to hold African Trench and had to be
content with African Support. The Fifth Division shared in this fighting. This
engagement was part of a local co-operation in an attack made by the Fifth
Corps in the south.</p>
<p>On September 12 there was a combined attack, which has already been
mentioned, by which the Fourth and Sixth Corps should capture Trescault Spur
and Havrincourt. It will be remembered that the latter was captured by the
Sixty-second Yorkshire Division. The New Zealanders advanced upon the Spur,
where they met with very vigorous opposition from their old enemies, the
Jaeger, who fought with great tenacity. The Thirty-seventh Division turned the
Spur from the south, however, capturing both Trescault and Bilhem. Two guns and
500 prisoners were captured. On September 18 the Fifth Division together with
the Welsh Division of the Fifth Corps undertook a local operation against
African Trench, but the indefatigable German Jaeger still remained masters of
the situation. At 5.20 P.M. on that day the initiative passed to the enemy, who
broke suddenly into a very heavy bombardment, followed by a furious attack upon
the left of the Thirty-seventh Division. It made some progress at first and the
British losses were heavy, especially in the case of the 1st Herts, a battalion
which has many times shown great steadiness and gallantry. Lieutenant Young of
this unit rallied his men and counter-attacked at a critical moment, dying
single-handed amid the German ranks but winning a posthumous V.C.</p>
<p>We have now brought the record of the Fourth Corps level with that of the
Fifth to the south and of the Sixth to the north. It is necessary to give some
fuller account of the Seventeenth Corps which had been formed on the left of
the Sixth. This will complete the account of General Byng's operations with his
Third Army from their inception on August 21 until the eve of the great general
battle which was to break out at the end of September.</p>
<p>It has already been stated that on August 25 Sir Charles Fergusson's
Seventeenth Corps was formed on the left of General Byng's Third Army and
became the northern unit in that force, having the Sixth Corps on its right and
the Canadian Corps on its left. It contained at first three divisions, the
Fifty-second (Hill), Fifty-sixth (Hull), and Fifty-seventh (Barnes). Two of
these had already been heavily engaged in the new advance before becoming part
of the Seventeenth Corps. Indeed on the day preceding the entrance of the Corps
into the line, the evening of August 24, the Fifty-sixth Division had attacked
the Hindenburg Line at Summit Trench and Hill Switch, near Croisilles, without
effect. They had now established themselves near their objective and were
waiting orders to try again.</p>
<p>The Fifty-second Division, one of the fine units which had been released
from Palestine owing to the reinforcements of Indian troops in that country,
had also tried for the Hindenburg Line and taken a bit of it upon August 24,
but they had found it too hot to hold. They were now lying low on the western
borders of Henin Hill, hoping to co-operate with the Canadians of the First
Army on their left at some later date. A line of British divisions was now
crouching in front of Hindenburg's bars all ready for a spring.</p>
<p>In the new attack it was planned that the Fifty-sixth Londoners should
co-operate with the Sixth Corps on their right, and clear the village of
Croisilles by outflanking it, while the Fifty-second Division should work on
the north of the Cojeul stream in close touch with the big Canadian attack,
advancing towards Fontaine-les-Croisilles. The effect of these movements would
be that the portion of the Hindenburg Line which faced the Seventeenth Corps
would be attacked from the rear instead of the front.</p>
<p>On August 26 at 3 A.M. the Canadians went forward, as will be told under the
head of their operations. The Fifty-second Division kept its place on their
right flank, working up along the Cojeul River, and carrying all the objectives
allotted to them. By 10.35 A.M. their task had been completed and they were
still in close touch with the Canadians. In the afternoon the 155th Brigade on
the extreme left, consisting of Scottish Territorials, attacked Henin Hill from
the north-west, capturing a succession of machine-gun positions. The crews of
these guns got&mdash;and indeed accepted&mdash;little quarter, fighting
staunchly to the last. By 4 o'clock the Fifty-second Division was well into the
Hindenburg Line from the Cojeul northwards; and by 5 o'clock the 155th Brigade
was across Henin Hill, moving southeast. The whole of this very important
position was now in British possession, though there were pockets of the enemy
scattered here and there who were holding out to the last. The Fifty-sixth
Division on the right was still in front of Croisilles, sending out occasional
patrols which reported that the village was still strongly held. Its orders
were to maintain pressure but not to advance until the development of the
movement in the north should shake the enemy's resistance.</p>
<p>On August 27 Croisilles and the strong trenches around it were kept under
bombardment. The Fifty-sixth Division began to thrust forward its left flank,
and made some progress, but was eventually held by very heavy fire from the
south. At midday the Fifty-second Division was driving down from the north,
getting to the Sens&eacute;e River about Fontaine and endeavouring to help the
left of the Fifty-sixth Division by moving along the Hindenburg Line. This was
partly accomplished, but it was impossible for the Fifty-sixth to get ahead as
the troops on their right in the Ledger Trenches had also been held up. That
evening the Fifty-second Division after a fine term of service was drawn out
and the Fifty-seventh took its place.</p>
<p>Early on August 28 it was evident that the scheme for pinching out
Croisilles had been successful. At 8 A.M. a contact aeroplane reported the
village to be empty, and at 8.30 the London patrols were in the main street.
There now lay Bullecourt in front of the Fifty-sixth, and Hendecourt and
Riencourt in front of the Fifty-seventh Division. At 12.30 the attack was in
full swing, lines of the gallant Territorials of London and Lancashire
streaming across the low dun-coloured curves which are cut by the famous
trenches. It was a long uphill fight, but by 4.30 in the afternoon the 169th
Brigade, containing the London Rifle Brigade, the 2nd Londons, and the
Westminsters, had fought their way into Bullecourt. There they were held,
however, for there were numerous pockets of Germans in their rear, and the
machine-guns pelted them from every side, while the village was far from clear.
The 167th Brigade on the right had also been held up by machine-guns, all three
battalions, the 1st London and the 7th and 8th Middlesex, having heavy losses
and being forced back for a time. The Fifty-seventh Division on the left of the
line encountered the same desperate resistance, which could only have been
overcome by troops who would take no denial. Hendecourt was not reached, but
all the gains of the morning were held as a basis for a future advance. The
liaison on either flank with the Sixth Corps and the Canadians was complete. It
had been a day of very hard and expensive fighting and of no very marked
suocess.</p>
<p>The battle was renewed about midday on August 29, the morning having been
devoted to re-pulverising the powder-heap of Bullecourt with heavy artillery-,
and to clearing up some of the pockets in the immediate front of the advance.
The Fifty-sixth Division advanced once more, the 168th Brigade having taken the
right of the line. The machine-guns were still very destructive, and the right
and centre were held up, though the left made some progress. The general result
was to get the British line all round Bullecourt, but the village itself was
still defiant. The Fifty-seventh Division on the left had another day of
desperate fighting, in which the Lancashire Territorials showed their usual
valour. At 4.30 some of them had got through Hendecourt and had penetrated,
with great difficulty and suffering heavily, into Riencourt. It was afterwards
found that some ardent spirits had even forced their way into the
Drocourt&mdash;Qu&eacute;ant line, and left their dead there as a proof for
those who followed after. The line in the evening was the western outskirts of
Hendecourt, where they were in touch with the right of the Canadian
Division.</p>
<p>At 5 A.M. on the morning of August 30 the Germans, who had a perfectly clear
vision of the fact that the loss of the Hindenburg Line must entail the loss of
the war, attacked in great force along the general line
Ecoust&mdash;Bullecourt&mdash;Hendecourt, and made some considerable dents in
the British front, especially at Bullecourt, which had to be evacuated. The
Fifty-seventh were pushed back to the line of the Hendecourt&mdash;Bullecourt
Road, and abandoned the ruins of an old factory, which is a marked position.
This attack corresponds with the one already detailed when the Third Division
were driven out of Ecoust, and it is heavy weather indeed when the Third
Division begins to make leeway. The Fifty-sixth tried very gallantly to regain
Bullecourt by a bombing attack, but it could not be done. The Germans got a
footing in Hendecourt, but could not clear it, and the evening saw the
Lancashire Territorials and their enemy at close grips among the ruins.</p>
<p>On the morning of August 31 the indefatigable Londoners attacked once more,
the 4th Londons, London Scottish, and Kensingtons of the 168th Brigade carrying
on the work. The factory was soon retaken and so was the Station Redoubt, but
Bullecourt itself, squirting flames from every cranny, was still inviolate. On
the right the Third Division had recaptured Ecoust, which relieved the general
situation. The British bombers got into Bullecourt in the afternoon and before
evening they had made good the greater part of the ruins, a handful of Germans
still clinging manfully to the eastern edge. That night the Fifty-second came
to the front and relieved the Fifty-sixth. In the five days' battle the London
division had lost 123 officers and 2600 men. On the other hand they had
captured 29 officers and over a thousand men, while they had inflicted very
heavy losses upon the enemy.</p>
<p>September 1 saw this long-drawn battle still in full progress. There is
nothing more amazing than the way in which the British divisions at this stage
of the war without reinforcements carried on the fight from day to day as
though they were sustained by some prophetic vision of the imminent victory
which was so largely the result of their heroic efforts. With the early morning
the Fifty-seventh Division was into Hendecourt, and before seven o'clock the
171st Brigade had completely cleared the village and joined hands with the
Canadians on the farther side. There was a great deal of actual bayonet work in
this assault, and Lancashire came out triumphant. On the right the Fifty-second
Division had a busy morning in clearing out the dug-outs and cellars of
Bulle-court. In the afternoon they advanced eastwards and cleared another 500
yards of ground, when they came under very heavy fire from Noreuil on their
right flank. The 155th Brigade was lashed with a pelting rain of bullets, one
battalion, the 4th Scots Borderers, losing 10 officers and 140 men in a few
minutes. The advance was continued, however, until Tank Avenue, the immediate
objective, was reached and cleared. It was a splendid example of indomitable
perseverance.</p>
<p>The 171st Brigade, which was still advancing on the left, had also undergone
the torment of the machine-guns, but some skilful flanking movements by
supporting platoons enabled progress to be made and the German posts soon
surrendered when there was a danger of being surrounded. Riencourt fell, and by
6.30 the extreme objectives had been gained and touch established on either
flank.</p>
<p>The success of this spirited attack, with the heavy losses inflicted, seemed
to have cowed the enemy before the Fifty-seventh Division, for the night passed
quietly on that front, which was very helpful in allowing the preparations to
go forward for the considerable operation planned for next morning.</p>
<p>September 2 was the date for the main attack by the First Army upon the
Drocourt&mdash;Qu&eacute;ant line south of the Scarpe, to which all the
fighting which has been detailed was but a preliminary. The r&ocirc;le assigned
to the Seventeenth Corps was to co-operate with the Canadians by thrusting
forward their left flank so as to gain position for an attack upon
Qu&eacute;ant from the north. The Sixth Corps on their right was ordered to
attack Morchies and Lagnicourt and then push forward vigorously towards
Beaumetz. The First Canadian Division, with Gagnicourt for its objective, was
on the immediate left of the Seventeenth Corps. The orders to the Seventeenth
Corps were that the Fifty-seventh Division should support the Canadian attack,
that the Fifty-second Division should conform to the movements of the
Fifty-seventh on its left and of the Third on its right, and finally that the
Sixty-third Naval Division, now added to the Corps, should move up in support
and improve whatever advantages were gained.</p>
<p>At 5 A.M. the barrage fell and the troops moved forward upon one of the
critical battles of the war. The grand part played by the Canadians in the
north is described elsewhere. The .172nd Brigade of the Fifty-seventh Division
advanced splendidly towards the gap which had been formed, a storm of gas
shells bursting among their stolid ranks. The leading battalion, the 1st
Munster Fusiliers, followed the men of the Dominion through the breach which
they had made in the Drocourt&mdash;Qu&eacute;ant switch, and then according to
plan swung sharply to the right, smashing their way with bomb and bayonet down
the whole line of the German position and so clearing the front for their
comrades. It was a fine exploit and worthy of the great battalion which carried
it out. They were strongly counter-attacked at the moment when, panting and
weary, they had reached their full objective, and yet they retained sufficient
vitality to drive back the German stormers.</p>
<p>Other elements of the 172nd Brigade had worked south on the right of the
Munsters, and got forward as far as Possum Lane, so that they formed a useful
defensive flank on the left of the Fifty-second Division. Meanwhile the 171st
Brigade had advanced directly from Riencourt Ridge and had cleared up the
trenches opposite, which were enfiladed by their comrades.</p>
<p>The Sixty-third Division was now brought forward to play its part, with the
188th Brigade, consisting of Ansons, Marines, and Royal Irish, in the van. At 9
A.M. it passed through the left of the Fifty-seventh Division about a mile
south of Gagnicourt. From this point it was continually advancing during the
day, being in touch with the First Canadians on the left and with the
Fifty-seventh on the right. By nine in the evening it was seated firmly in the
Hindenburg Line. The switch line of Drocourt&mdash;Qu&eacute;ant had been
ruptured as early as 8 in the morning, which was the signal for the
Fifty-second Division on the south to advance upon the main Hindenburg Line
south-west of Qu&eacute;ant. The 156th Brigade was in the van. Some few parties
reached the main objective, but by 10 o'clock the advance had been suspended,
as operations had not yet progressed sufficiently elsewhere. The Fifty-seoond
continued, however, to exert pressure at the point of junction between the
switch and the Hindenburg support line. All day progress was being made in
proportion as the attack drove down from the north, so that by 3 P.M. the front
line had been cleared, and before midnight the whole of the German defences, a
perfect maze of trenches and wire, were in the hands of the British infantry.
At this hour patrols had penetrated into Qu&eacute;ant and found it clear. Such
was the close, so far as the Seventeenth Corps was concerned, of one of the
most decisive days' fighting in the whole of the war. Late that night the
tireless Sixty-third Division had reached Pronville, where they added more
prisoners to their considerable captures. Altogether about a thousand were
taken by the Corps during the day, with a large amount of material.</p>
<p>September 3 saw the Sixty-third Division still adding to its gains. In the
morning it occupied Tadpole Copse and advanced upon the Canal du Nord. It then
captured Inchy, but was held up in front of Moeuvres by strong enemy
rearguards. This marked a definite line of equilibrium which was maintained
until the general dispositions of the Army allowed a further advance. For a
considerable time the only fighting upon this Corps front was in connection
with Moeuvres, a village which remained as a sort of No Man's Land until, on
September 19, a spirited attack by the 155th Scottish Brigade of the
Fifty-second Division put it finally into British hands. After this there was
quiet on the left flank of the Third Army until the great operations at the end
of the month.</p>

<h2><a id="chap5" name="chap5">V. THE ADVANCE OF HORNE'S FIRST ARMY</a><br>
From August 26 to September 27</h2>
<p class="chaphead">The indefatigable Fifty-first Division&mdash;Capture of
Greenland Hill&mdash;Fine advance of the Canadians&mdash;Breaking of the
Drocourt&mdash;Queant line&mdash;Fine work of the Sixty-third Naval
Division&mdash;Great day for the Dominion&mdash;Demeanour of German
prisoners.</p>
<p class="first">ON August 8 Rawlinson had attacked on the south with the
Fourth Army. On August 22 Byng followed on his left with the Third Army. Four
days later Horne took it up in turn south of the Scarpe with his First Army.
The general function of that Army was to co-operate with the attack of the
Third Army on its right, and to cover the flank of that Army from the north.
Therefore the First and Eighth Corps stood fast, while the Canadians, who had
been brought up from the southern sector, advanced. They formed the right unit
of the First Army, and were in touch to the south with Fergusson's newly formed
Seventeenth Corps, which was the left unit of the Third Army. As only the
Canadians were seriously engaged up to the end of September the narrative of
the First Army can be easily summarised.</p>
<p>It will be necessary first to explain some preliminary operations. After its
return from its hard fighting in the French line, where it had co-operated with
the Sixty-second Division in attacking the great German salient upon the
Ardres, the famous Fifty-first Highland Division had only a few days' rest
before it was in action once more. It was now placed on the north bank of the
Scarpe in the Arras sector. The 170th Brigade of the Fifty-seventh Lancashire
Territorial Division lay to the south of the stream, and this was placed under
the command of Carter-Campbell, General of the Fifty-first, so that he had four
brigades under him, with instructions to advance along the line of the river,
as opportunity served, in order to screen the left of the attack now about to
break out in the south. Carter-Campbell covered from Feuchy in the south to the
east of Bailleul, about 8000 yards.</p>
<p>It was known that the enemy was withdrawing its advanced positions in front
of the Army, and it was therefore very necessary for Fergusson's Seventeenth
Corps to keep in touch with the Germans in that region. With this object in
view the 170th Brigade in conjunction with the Fifteenth Division on their
right moved along the south bank of the river to seize the advanced German
trenches. This was done at 1 A.M. of August 19, when a considerable stretch of
ground was occupied with little opposition. An endeavour to increase their
gains on the next night was met by a sharp counter-attack. On the same night
two brigades of the Fifty-first Division pushed forwards north of the river,
but met with very strong resistance. On August 20 there was another German
attack upon Moray Trench, south of the Scarpe, but the Lancashire men broke it
up by artillery and rifle-fire. By 9 P.M., however, the 170th Brigade were
ordered back from their advanced position, having been badly harried all day.
On August 24 in the early morning the Fifty-seventh Division advanced with good
results, the 153rd Brigade capturing Pippin Trenoh and other important points.
The 152nd Brigade lay to the immediate west of Fampoux, and did not move, but
the advance was again carried on upon the left on August 25 with some gain of
ground.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Canadian Corps had quietly taken the place of Fergusson's
Seventeenth Corps to the south of the Scarpe, pushing them to the south, and
all was ready for the big battle which broke out on August 26, and was a
continuation to the north of the large movement already going on down the line.
In this important attack, the Third Canadian Division was on the left, and the
Second on the right, the two of them bridging the space between the Scarpe and
the left of the Third Army. It was stated by prisoners that the attack had been
foreseen, and that they had withdrawn 2000 yards the day before. However that
may be, everything went very well, and the men of the Dominion showed their
usual determined valour. The 7th and 8th Canadian Brigades, just south of the
river, swept along with hardly a check, save for a time when the 8th was held
up behind Orange Hill. At 7.35, Monchy, important as a place of observation,
was in British hands once more. At 10.45, the 4th Canadian Brigade had captured
Gu&eacute;mappe, and in the afternoon, Wancourt Ridge had also fallen to the
Second Canadian Division. Here, as elsewhere, a single day had given what weeks
of effort had once failed to achieve; 2000 prisoners were taken.</p>
<p>On the north bank, the Fifty-first Division, which was now part of the
Canadian Corps, made a similar advance, both the 152nd and 153rd Brigades
sweeping forward, and occupying Roeux, Gavrelle and the Chemical Works, with
little opposition. The Eighth Division was to the north of the Fifty-first, and
it also pushed forward its line, its patrols occupying Oppy after dusk.</p>
<p>The Eighth Division, reconstituted under its veteran commander, General
Heneker, after its murderous and heroic experience upon the Aisne, was the
right-hand unit of Hunter-Weston's Eighth Corps, which was the next unit of the
First Army. The front of this Corps was formed by the Twentieth Division in the
north and the Eighth in the south, and its r&ocirc;le at this period was to
stand fast, but by a succession of well-conducted enterprises the Eighth
Division was continually encroaching upon the German lines. Presently, as will
be seen, when the line was advanced on the south, the Eighth Corps was
unleashed and sprang forward in combination with the general advance on either
flank. On its left, and following its general movements, was Holland's First
Corps, which was allotted, after September 20, to the Fifth Army, so that
instead of being Horne's northern unit it became the southern Corps of
Birdwood.</p>
<p>On August 27 the Canadians went forward once more, the 9th Brigade on the
left near the river, while the 4th and 5th were on the right. Again there was a
day of steady advance, which was rather a slow pursuit than a battle. In the
evening the line ran east of Cherisy, but west of Pelves and Haucourt. In the
north the Fifty-first Division attacked Greenland Hill, which was a most
important piece of high ground&mdash;so important that it may be said to be the
point on which the whole great advance to the Canal du Nord pivoted. The attack
was delivered with great spirit by the 7th Gordons and 6th Black Watch of the
153rd Brigade, but they were unable to get the summit; while the 6th Seaforths
to the south of them were also held up by machine-gun fire. Some advance was
made, however, by the 154th Brigade, which had now come in on the north of the
line. That night the 25th Brigade of the Eighth Division took over this
northern section.</p>
<p>August 28 saw the Canadians still continuing their slow but inexorable
advance. On that morning their 7th Brigade took Pelves and Boiry. There were
two strong counter-attacks upon the Second Canadian Division in the evening
near Artillery Hill, and for a time the front line was pushed back, but it soon
recovered and held firm. There was quiet now on the Canadian front, but on
August 29 the 154th Brigade of the Highland Division made a fresh attack upon
Greenland Hill, which was captured by the 4th Gordons and 7th Argyll and
Sutherlands with only slight losses. This important success caused the
evacuation by the enemy of several positions commanded by the hill, especially
Delbar Wood. This capture screened the left flank of the Canadians and drew
from their General a generous message of thanks, in which he said, "That your
division after its continuous fighting for the last year was able to take and
keep the strong position of Greenland Hill, testifies to the fact that the
fighting qualities of the Fifty-first are second to none in the Allied
armies."</p>
<p>There were some changes of troops at this date in preparation for the big
attack upon the Hindenburg switch line which was impending. The Twenty-second
Corps (Godley) now formed on the left of the Canadians, took over the
Fifty-first Division, and also occupied the south bank of the Scarpe with the
Eleventh Division. It retained the Forty-ninth Division (Cameron) in reserve.
On the other hand, the Fourth British Division was attached to the Canadians,
and came into their centre at Remy and Haucourt. At dawn on August 30 the
Canadian First Division attacked Upton Wood and the trenches near, with the
object of straightening the line and maintaining close touch with the
Seventeenth Corps on the right. This movement was splendidly successful, and
500 prisoners were taken. The Fourth British Division advanced at the same time
and their line in the evening was just east of Eterpigny. Next day they were
held up once at St. Servin Farm, but took it at the second attempt. Meanwhile,
the Eleventh Division was moving steadily forward on the south bank of the
river. It was relieved on October 1 by the Fifty-sixth London Division, acting
under the Twenty-second Corps.</p>
<p>On September 1 the Canadian Corps was outside the Arras&mdash;Cambrai Road,
with the Fourth British Division forming its left flank, the Fourth Canadian
its centre, and the First Canadian on the right. It was a day of local attacks
and bickerings, but great preparations were on foot for the morrow. The first
light of dawn had hardly begun to glimmer in front of the eager lines of
infantry before the signal was given for the advance upon the
Drocourt&mdash;Qu&eacute;ant line. This line is not the main Hindenburg Line,
but it is a northern extension of the Hindenburg system, and it may be said to
cover the towns of Douai and Cambrai. The advance of the First Army was on a
front of five brigades&mdash;one belonging to the British Fourth Division on
the left, and two of each first line Canadian Division to their right. The
general idea of the day's operations&mdash;among the most important of the
war&mdash;was to break through the German line upon a narrow front, and
afterwards to roll up the flanks of the enemy, both north and south. This
having been done, the main attack was to push through, seize the higher ground
overlooking the Canal du Nord, and if possible cross the Canal and seize the
farther bank.</p>
<p>The attack should be from the Sens&eacute;e River, southwards, and the
function of the Twenty-second Corps was to form a defensive flank on the left
of the attack, taking up consecutive positions eastwards along the River
Sens&eacute;e, and working in close collaboration with the British Fourth
Division.</p>
<p>There was a preliminary bombardment, but the guns had been busy wire-cutting
during the last three days, so that the great metal aprons which extended from
the German position were ragged and torn. Hence they offered small impediment
to the infantry who dashed through at the first rush, and easily captured the
outlying trenches which stretched across a low hill. The village of Gagnicourt
lay imbedded in the German trenches, and this was a centre both of attack and
resistance. By 8 o'clock the Canadian infantry of the First Division had
carried the village, while the Canadian Fourth Division was in Dury on the
left, and had made its way into Dury Wood. The advance had already covered
about 3000 yards. Both the barrage and the tanks were admirable, and the
combination beat down the German defence which at first was not
formidable&mdash;indeed many of the German front-liners escaped the shrapnel by
running in front of it and surrendering the moment the battle began.</p>
<p>As the advance progressed the German resistance grew stiffer, especially in
front of the Fourth Canadian Division at Dury Wood, where there was some very
desperate fighting. All along the line, pockets of German snipers and
machine-gunners did what they could to redeem the honour of the German Army.
Astride the Cambrai Road there was a particularly strong point of opposition.
The defenders were numerous all along the line&mdash;so much so that prisoners
from six different German divisions were captured, including the First and
Seoond Guards Reserve, and the Third Division which had only arrived the night
before with orders to advance into the Canadian area. Many of them did so as
far as the prisoners' cage.</p>
<p>This splendid advance of the Canadians had been covered and supported on the
right by the Fifty-seventh Lancashire Division of Fergusson's Seventeenth
Corps, which had cleared up the villages of Riencourt and Hendecourt in a
preliminary operation on September 1. The Lancashire men made good the Canadian
flank, and then the Sixty-third Naval Division of the same Corps skirted the
southern edge of Gagnicourt, passing the Canadian troops, and pushed on to
Buissy, nearly two miles further east. This advance was on a front of a mile,
and brought the victors into contact with six other German divisions, each of
which provided samples for the cages. Not content with this fine performance,
the Naval Division, who were now ahead of their guns and without tanks, pushed
on again in the evening, and inclining to the south they captured the village
of Pronville, thus getting to the east of Qu&eacute;ant, which was still held
by the Germans. The Drake, Anson, Hood, and Hawke battalions, together with the
Royal Marine units, were all heavily engaged during this long day of
fighting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Canadians had carried on along the original line of advance,
the First Canadian Division clearing the woods of Loison and Bouche. On the
extreme left the Fourth British Division added to its great fighting record
another strenuous day of battle. It had in front of it a very strong position,
Prospect Farm, which offered a desperate resistance, but was eventually taken.
It was afternoon, however, before the place fell, which prevented the
attainment of the full objectives of the day. They were still advancing in the
morning of September 3, and before noon they had taken all their original
objectives, including Etaing and Lecluse, while on the same morning the Fourth
Canadians got as far forward as Rumancourt.</p>
<p>It was a fine victory, which will make September 2, 1918, memorable to
Canadians. Great work was done by the British divisions on either side of them,
but the stress of the attack and the consequent credit lay with our comrades
from across the Atlantic. More than 10,000 prisoners were taken during the day.
Their demeanour as described by Mr. Perry Robinson, the well-known
correspondent of The Times, is of interest as reflecting the softening and
disintegrating influences in the German Army. "As the newcomers arrived they
were greeted with shouts of laughter and welcome by their comrades already
behind the wires, and greetings and badinage and names were called back and
forth. Those inside were mostly eating, and held up bully-beef tins and
biscuits for the new arrivals to see, and the latter cheered
responsively...Many were very tired, but the whole scene suggested a new
train-load of revellers at some annual bean-feast being welcomed by

<p>The Germans had dammed the river which flows down the Trinquis valley in
front of the Twenty-second Corps, and this had now formed a considerable lake
which hampered operations to the north. The Fresnes&mdash;Rouvroy line when
tested by patrols seemed to be still strongly held. It soon became evident,
however, that on the south the Germans had withdrawn behind the Canal du Nord.
The Canadians on September 3 closed up to the western bank, occupying with
little resistance Recourt and Baralle. During the day the First British
Division relieved the Fourth British Division, while the Second and Third
Canadians relieved respectively the First and Fourth Canadians. The Canal was
found to be full, and all the bridges down, so that progress was for the time
suspended, and a period of inaction followed, which was accompanied by a bad
spell of boisterous weather, lasting for more than a week. During this time the
First British Division was sent south to form part of the Ninth Corps on the
extreme south of the line next to the French. The Fifty-sixth London Division
took its place on the right of the Twenty-second Corps, and on September 19 it
extended so as to take over the ground held by the Third Canadians, thus
contracting the Canadians' front on that flank, while it was extended to the
south, where it took over from the Fifty-second Division on the left of the
Seventeenth Corps. The Cambrai Road became the dividing line between the
British and the Canadians. To preserve uniformity of treatment we shall now
return to Rawlinson's Fourth Army in the south, and we shall carry each
successive Army forward from the end of September to the date of the German
surrender.</p>

ARMY</a><br>
From the Battle of the Hindenburg Line (September 29)<br>
to the Battle of the Selle, October 17</h2>
<p class="chaphead">The first American operations&mdash;The rupture of the
Hindenburg Line&mdash;Predicament of Twenty-Seventh American
Division&mdash;Their gallant resistance&mdash;Great Australian
attack&mdash;Remarkable feat by the Forty- Sixth North Midland Territorial
Division&mdash;-Exeunt the Third Corps and the Australians&mdash;Entrance of
the Thirteenth Corps&mdash;Rupture of the Beaurevoir line&mdash;Advance to the
Selle River.</p>
<p class="first">TURNING to Rawlinson's Fourth Army, which were last seen in
contact with the old Hindenburg Line along its formidable front from Vandhuile
on the left to Gricourt on the right, it will be remembered that it consisted
of Butler's Third Corps on the left, the Australian Corps in the centre, and
Braithwaite's Ninth Corps on the right in contact with the French. The time had
now come for an attack on the largest scale in order to endeavour to carry this
Chinese Wall of Germany by storm. The part assigned to the Third Corps in this
important operation was not a large one, and their front was now contracted to
2000 yards, while two of their divisions, the Fifty-eighth Londoners and the
Seventy-fourth Yeomanry, were transferred to another area. There remained only
the Twelfth and Eighteenth Divisions in line, which had to cover the left flank
of the main attack which was to be made by the Australian and Second American
Corps, and by Braithwaite's Ninth Corps to the south of them.</p>
<p>At this point the great Canal de l'Escaut passes under a tunnel which is
nearly six miles in length. Thus it is the only place in the whole line where
tanks could be used to advantage. The general plan was that this section of the
line should be carried by the Second American Corps as far north as the
northern entrance of the tunnel. This done they would extend their gains to the
left in a north-easterly direction beyond Vandhuile, so as to open up a way for
the Fifth Corps. After the line had been taken Australian Divisions were to
move forward through the Americans and push the advantage to the east. The
r&ocirc;le of the Third Corps was to cover the left of the Americans, and then,
when the latter had moved northwards, to mop up Vandhuile, establish
bridge-heads east of that point, and bridge the canal for the Thirty-eighth
Welsh Division on the right of the Fifth Corps to get across.</p>
<p>Before the general attack which took place on that <i>dies irae</i>,
September 29, the Americans had a brisk fight of their own, which deserves some
special mention as it was the first large operation of an American force acting
as part of a British Army. The Second American Army Corps (General Read) had
been specially selected to lead the attack on September 29, and as a
preparation for this great effort they were ordered to make some advance along
their whole front in order to gain an advantageous point from which to start.
They lay roughly along the front of the Hindenburg outpost line, but they
needed to draw up closer to the main line before the day of battle. On the
night of September 24, General O'Ryan's Twenty-seventh American Division from
New York on the left relieved the Eighteenth and Seventy-fourth British
Divisions, taking over a front of 4500 yards opposite to Gouy. The defences
immediately before them were particularly strong, including the notorious
danger points, the Knoll, Quinnemont Farm, and Guillemont Farm. The 53rd
American Brigade (Pierce) took over the line, with the 106th Infantry Regiment
in front and the 105th in support. The entire American front was from near
Vandhuile in the north to Bellicourt in the south.</p>
<p>The tunnel, which formed a special feature in the next great battle,
deserves some description, as it was a remarkable feature dating back to the
First Empire, and still bearing upon its arches the laconic N of the great
Corsican. It is 6000 yards long and averages 50 feet below the surface, with a
breadth of about 70 feet. The Germans had converted it into an extraordinary
military work, for it was stuffed with barges in which a whole division could
take absolute refuge from the heaviest barrage ever launched. There were all
sorts of bolt-holes in every direction for getting in or out, and there were
powerful machine-gun emplacements along the top. Altogether it was as awkward a
nut to crack as any military engineer could conceive. The main Hindenburg Line
lay a couple of hundred yards west of the tunnel, a heavily-wired system of
trenches. About a mile farther east was a strong support line joining the
villages of Nauroy and Le Catelet, while two or three miles farther on was yet
another strong position, known as the Beaurevoir line. The way in which
Americans, Australians, and British combined with equal valour to hunt the
Germans out of this terrific series of positions is a story which will go down
in the common traditions of the English-speaking race.</p>
<p>At 5.30 A.M. on September 27 there was the preliminary operation, already
mentioned, which should gain the ground necessary for the jumping-off place.
This was done by General Lewis' Thirtieth American Division on the right with
little difficulty. It was different with the Twenty-seventh on the left. On
this flank a depth of about 1100 yards had to be gained, coinciding roughly
with the rearmost trenches of the Hindenburg outpost line. This task was
carried out by the 106th Infantry with all three battalions in line and four
tanks ahead of each battalion. The leading companies, following the barrage,
reached their objectives in most cases, but were involved in desperate fighting
at the points already mentioned, which were connected by crosscuts with the
main German line, from which there flowed an endless supply of reinforcements.
All day attack and counter-attack followed each other, both parties fighting
with great valour and enduring heavy loss. By night the 53rd American Brigade
was well advanced on its right, but its left was still battling hard to reach
the allotted line: 8 officers and 259 Germans had been taken in the fighting.
That night the 54th Brigade (Blanding) took over the new front and lay ready
for the coming battle, with the 108th Infantry on the right and the 107th on
the left. On the front of the Thirtieth Division the 60th Brigade (Faison) was
in line, with the 119th and 120th Infantry in the van, the latter to the right,
in touch with the British Ninth Corps to the south of them.</p>
<p>The task which lay before the New Yorkers of the Twenty-seventh American
Division was particularly difficult, because the men were so scattered over
1100 yards of depth that the barrage had to be thrown forward to cover that
area of ground. Thus the main body of the stormers had to cross that space
before getting the full protection of the artillery. There were no American
guns in action, but the British artillery was as splendidly efficient as ever,
crashing down at 5.30 A.M. upon the starting line, where it lingered for four
minutes and then advanced at the rate of 100 yards in every four minutes. The
German barrage came down instantly in reply, and though it was not very heavy
it inflicted considerable damage upon the supporting troops. What with fog and
smoke it was difficult to see more than a few feet in any direction, and this
was a great advantage to the stormers, the more so to troops who are so
individual as the Americans. The Thirtieth Division on the right, a unit raised
in the Carolinas and Tennessee, dashed through the main Hindenburg Line in the
most gallant fashion, capturing Bellicourt on the way, while the veteran
Australian Fifth Division passed through their cheering ranks after they had
reached their allotted limit. The 117th American Regiment on the right was in
close touch to the south with the Forty-sixth British Division, whose fine
advance is chronicled elsewhere, so that the British, American, and Australian
dead lay along the same battle-line. The 120th American Regiment on the left
had taken and held Nauroy, but had been forced to bend its line back at the
north end as far as the tunnel, on account of the fire which beat upon them on
that flank.</p>
<p>The Twenty-seventh Division had met with grave difficulties from the start,
for the tanks encountered mines and traps, while the infantry as already
explained had practically no barrage, and found a strongly posted enemy in
front of them. The men behaved with the utmost gallantry and the officers led
them with great devotion, but no troops in the world could have carried the
defences under such circumstances. For a thousand yards north of the
inter-divisional boundary, near the village of Bony, they got into the main
line, and from point to point all along the front bold parties pushed forward
as far as Gouy and Le Catelet, many of whom never got back. The more successful
were ruined by their own success, for as the mist rose it was found that in
their swift advance they had left many pockets and strong points behind them
which fired into their backs when they rose to advance. The Third Australians,
following up the attack, could do little to make matters better, for all this
part of the field of battle was such a complete mix-up, and the two armies were
so dovetailed into each other, that it was impossible to use artillery, and yet
the situation was such that without artillery it was quixotic madness for the
infantry to advance. The reinforcing Australians were held up on the line
between the Knoll and Guillemont Farm. Groups of brave men gathered together
from time to time, and stormed up to Guillemont and Quinnemont Farms, which
were among the most deadly of the German strongholds. A British Divisional
General assured the present chronicler immediately after the action that he had
never seen the dead lie so thick at any spot during the war as the Americans
lay round Guillemont Farm. Neither the blue-clad infantry of Grant nor the grey
Confederates of Lee showed a higher spirit than the khaki-clad lads who fought
alongside the British that day. The best that could be done, however, was to
hold such ground as had been gained, and to wait until the advance of the Fifth
Australians from the south, and of the Eighteenth British Division from the
north, should make all their section of line untenable for the Germans. The
Twenty-seventh Americans and Third Australians had in the meantime held on to
every inch of ground they had gained, and also to every prisoner whom they had
taken. On the night of September 30, the Americans, shattered in numbers, but
with unabated spirit, were withdrawn from the line. Altogether 40 officers and
1100 men had been taken from the enemy.(*)</p>
<p class="footnote">(*) It was the privilege of the present writer to see the
actual operations during this decisive action which broke the Hindenburg Line.
His account, written at the time, of his personal experience is too slight for
the text, but has been reproduced in the Appendix, where it can be consulted or
avoided by the reader.</p>
<p>It is necessary now to state the difficult and confused events of September
29 from the point of view of the Fifth Australian Division, who had almost as
severe a day as their compatriots on the left. General Hobbs' Division went
forward with the 8th Brigade on the right, which was in constant touch with the
British troops. On the left was the 15th Brigade, which eventually found its
northern flank in the air on account of the hold-up in that quarter. At 9.40
the line of the 8th Brigade passed Bellicourt, which the Americans had cleared.
As they advanced, however, they were scourged by a very heavy fire from the
direction of Nauroy. At midday the 32nd Battalion of Australians on the right
were in touch with the 4th Leicesters on Knobkerry Hill. As the Brigade
advanced they came upon concrete pill-boxes of the familiar type behind Nauroy
which caused heavy losses. Jon-court on the right was taken by the 32nd
Battalion, and at 8 in the evening the general line of Nauroy&mdash;Le Catelet
had been reached.</p>
<p>The 15th Brigade on the left had the harder task. The fog and the rapidity
of the American advance had combined to leave a number of machine-guns still
active, and there was constant opposition. Touch was maintained with the 44th
Battalion of the Third Australian Division on the left. A great many scattered
groups of Americans were reached, most of whom came on with the Australians.
The Brigade had been well provided with tanks, but in the space of fifteen
minutes all the heavies and most of the whippets had been knocked out. So mixed
were the conditions and so thick the clouds over the battlefield that for a
time the 59th Australian Battalion on the left was altogether lost, but the
57th and 58th fought on together, and with their American friends reached the
Le Catelet line, a bunch of Germans remaining in the trench between the two
battalions. The 59th was afterwards found to have trended northwards and to be
in close liaison with the right of the Third Australian Division.</p>
<p>The fighting had been mixed on September 29, but it became still more so
next day, and it will tax the industry of some Antipodean historian to trace
each unit, Australian or American, and define their relations to each other.
The r&ocirc;le of the 15th Brigade was simple as it was directed to make good
the rest of the Nauroy&mdash;Le Catelet line, which was in time accomplished.
The 14th Brigade was ordered to attack northwards in order to help the left
flank which had encountered such difficulties on the first day, while the 11th
Brigade was also directed towards the north-east, and ordered to take a strong
impediment called the Knob, which was eventually done. The 53rd Battalion which
led the 14th Brigade distinguished itself greatly, advancing with a steady
persistence which always gained its ends, and overflowing the German
field-guns. It was finally held up, however, and a strong counter-attack drove
it to take refuge in that part of the Le Catelet&mdash;Nauroy line which was
already in British hands. There was a good deal of close fighting in this
quarter but the gains were held by the 15th Brigade, which failed, however, to
get Cabaret Wood Farm. On October 1 the 56th Australian Battalion, with the aid
of tanks, carried Estr&eacute;es.</p>
<p>We shall now follow the work of General Braithwaite's Ninth Corps on the
extreme right of the whole British Army on this great day of battle. This Corps
consisted now of the First, Sixth, Thirty-second, and Forty-sixth Divisions. Of
these, the Sixth Division (harden) was in touch with the French, the First
(Strickland) was in the centre, and the Forty-sixth (Boyd) was on the left.
Opposite the Corps lay the broad and deep St. Quentin Canal, and the storm
troops of the Forty-sixth Division were fitted up with 3000 life-belts, having
proved by experiment that they were buoyant enough to support a fully-equipped
man. Since the Spanish infantry of Alva waded out neck-deep to attack the Dutch
defences on the Frisian Islands there has surely never been a more desperate
enterprise than this, when one remembers that on the farther side of the Canal
was every devilment which German sappers could construct, while no tanks could
lead the van of the stormers. The general plan was that the Forty-sixth North
Midlanders should take the whole position between Bellenglise and Riqueval;
that the Thirty-second Division (Lambert) should then pass through their ranks
and push onwards to Tronquoy and beyond; while the First Division should carry
out a difficult turning movement by swinging its left flank north-east to form
a defensive line between Pontruet and the Canal at the right of the Forty-sixth
Division's advance. The Sixth Division was to make threatening
demonstrations.</p>
<p>The very special obstacles which lay in the path of the Ninth Corps had led
to a reinforcement of their artillery, so that it was after a two days'
bombardment from 500 pieces of all calibres that the assault was made at the
same hour as that of the Americans on the left. The Stafford men of the 137th
Brigade led, with the 1st Regular Brigade covering their right flank. An
advance line of German trenches intervened between the British and the Canal.
Favoured by the thick mist the attackers were able to overrun these without any
great loss, killing most of the garrison who fought bravely for every inch of
ground, and winning their way to the Canal. In the meantime the 1st North
Lancashires cleared the trenches on their right, while farther south the 1st
Black Watch pushed forward from Pontruet, cleared the trenches north-east of
that place, and finally, squeezing out the North Lancashires, fought their way
down to the right flank of the Stafford stormers.</p>
<p>The 3rd Infantry Brigade had also become strongly engaged on the right of
the First Division. The 1st Gloucesters were pushed along the high ground a
mile south-east of Pontruet. Here they were held up for the time, but the 1st
South Wales Borderers came in on their left and connected up with the Black
Watch. All day the 3rd Brigade threw back a long flank north of Gricourt to the
Sixth Division, which was ordered to hold its ground.</p>
<p>The 137th Brigade having fought its way to the banks of the St. Quentin
Canal proceeded now to force the passage. The 6th South Staffords on the right
found the water low and there was little swimming to be done, but the 5th South
Staffords in the centre, and the 6th North Staffords on the left were hard put
to it to get across. The men dashed backwards and forwards on the bank, like
hounds that are balked, looking for the most hopeful spot, and then springing
into the water, sink or swim, with their gallant officers trailing ropes behind
them as they got across. In a few minutes the whole smooth surface of the Canal
for a mile or more was dotted with the heads of the English infantry, while
cables, broken bridges, extempore rafts, and leaking boats were all pressed
into the service. Within a few minutes the dripping ranks were into the
trenches on the eastern bank, where the moral effect of their dashing
achievement took all the iron out of the defenders. At Riqueval the bridge was
intact and the enemy pioneers in the act of blowing it up when the British
sappers and infantry swarmed in upon them and bayoneted them with the lanthorns
in their hands. This bridge and a second pontoon bridge made later by the
engineers and pioneers of the Forty-sixth and Thirty-second Divisions, were
invaluable as a means of communication.</p>
<p>The trenches and the tunnel entrance at Bellenglise were soon occupied and
the perilous passage had been safely made. The advance then continued, the
teams of four guns being shot down as they tried to get away. The 138th
Lincolns and Leicesters with the 139th Sherwood Forester Brigade had relieved
the Stafford battalions, which dropped back after having performed one of the
most notable feats of the war. These two brigades began to go forward preceded
by twelve tanks which had made their way round over the solid ground on the
Australian front. The advance was much impeded, however, by some German guns on
the west side of the Canal, to the south of the point where it had been
crossed. These guns, firing into the back of the 139th Brigade on the right,
knocked out by direct fire every one of the six tanks allotted to it. A party
of the Foresters then recrossed the Canal, shot or bayoneted these gunners, and
extinguished the opposition in the rear.</p>
<p>The 138th Brigade on the left advanced well, and by 12.30 was near Magny and
Le Haucourt, but it was necessary to call a halt, as the failure to hold Nauroy
upon the left had exposed the north flank of the division, while the south
flank had always been somewhat in the air. During the delay the barrage got
ahead, but the infantry soon overtook it once more, racing eagerly for the
protection of that slowly-moving cyclone. By 3 P.M. all objectives allotted to
the Forty-sixth Division had been taken, and by 4 P.M. the Thirty-second
Division had passed through their ranks&mdash;a glorious military picture on a
day of victory&mdash;with the old 14th Brigade in the van. The leading lines of
the infantry were now well up with the German guns, and it is on record that
the German gunners fought with the greatest valour and continued to fire their
guns at pointblank range up to the last. Many great deeds were done as small
bodies of infantry closed in on these guns, often dashing through their own
pelting barrage in their determination that the enemy should not have time to
limber up and get away. Nauroy had now fallen save only the north end, which
was still a scourge to the left flank of Braithwaite's Corps. Late in the
afternoon the 97th Brigade captured the southern half of Joncourt, and before
night Le Tronquoy had fallen also. From there the final line ran west of Le
Vergies, and then back to Etricourt, where it was in touch with the Thirtieth
American Division.</p>
<p>Late at night the Sixth Division on the extreme right, which had endured
heavy fighting all along its front during the day, was relieved by the
extension northwards of the Fifteenth French Corps. The Sixth Division went
into reserve. All night there was a bickering of machine-guns and rifle-fire
along the front, and before morning the 14th Brigade had completed the mopping
up of the villages which it had captured.</p>
<p>It was a most glorious day's work which reflects great credit upon General
Braithwaite and his men, who were allotted a task which it seemed presumptuous
to demand and yet carried it out to the last inch. The stormers captured 90
guns and 5400 prisoners during the day, the vast majority of which (70 guns and
4000 prisoners) fell to the Midland Territorials. It was fitting that in so
intimate a struggle as that between Great Britain and Germany it was men from
the very inner heart of England who at the critical moment struck the most
deadly blow.</p>
<p>On September 30 there was a continued forward movement on the front of the
Ninth Corps. The First Division took Thorigny and the Thirty-second Division
took Le Vergies during the day, with some 700 prisoners. The general movement
of troops was from the south, the French taking ground to the left in order to
release the British for that north-eastern movement which promised the more
decisive results.</p>
<p>On the morning of October 1 the Thirty-second Division, in close liaison
with the Australians, completed the capture of Joncourt, and made progress
towards Sequehart. During the afternoon the glad news arrived that the French
were progressing splendidly in the south and that their pioneers were in St.
Quentin. All day the Thirty-second Division was flowing slowly onwards, taking
Sequehart and establishing its van in the Fonsomme line, which extends from
that village to Beaurevoir. The Germans had given fanciful names to all of
these lines which were taken with such unfailing regularity by the Allies.
There were the Siegfried line, the Wotan line, and other Wagnerian titles,
which led some wit to remark at the time that if they went far enough through
the list of that composer's operas, they would certainly come, sooner or later,
to the Flying Dutchman. There was some confused fighting in the line south of
Ramicourt, but the setting sun found the Thirty-second Division in full
possession. It was clear, however, that heavy fighting was ahead, as the
Intelligence Department learned that three fresh divisions, the Eighty-fourth,
Two hundred and twenty-first, and Two hundred and forty-first, had come forward
to buttress the line of defence. These newcomers were strong enough to bar the
way successfully to the weary Thirty-second Division on the morning of October
2. In the evening the Germans passed to the attack and, backed by strong
gun-fire, they got temporary possession of Sequehart, the British line being
drawn across the high ground to the west of that village. We must now pause to
consider what was going on in the north.</p>
<p>As regards the part played by the Third Corps in these operations it was
mainly limited to the action of the 54th and 55th Brigades of the Eighteenth
Division, with elements of the Twelfth Division. On the left the 54th Brigade
attacked the position known as the Knoll, which was occupied by the 6th
Northants who repelled several severe counter-attacks. Any further movement was
hampered, however, by the deadly fire of the enemy from Guillemont Farm. The
55th Brigade was unable, as planned, to get down the Macquincourt valley as the
Hindenburg Line, which commanded it, was still intact. Next morning, however
(September 30), it was found possible to get forward as far as Guillemont Farm
and Vandhuile village, which were occupied with little loss, but the enemy was
still in force in the Hindenburg Line behind it, and attempts to cross the
Canal were checked by the German machine-guns. The 37th Brigade of the Twelfth
Division held the front line to the north-west of Vandhuile, with outposts
along the Canal, which they also were unable to cross. On October 1 it was
realised that the Australians working north had got in contact with the remains
of the Twenty-seventh American Division, and also with the 55th Brigade in the
Macquincourt valley. On the left the Fifth Corps had also reached the Canal. At
noon on October 1 the long term of service of the Third Corps was at an end,
and their section was taken over by Morland's Thirteenth Corps. The work of the
Third Corps during that time had been very brilliant. Between August 8 and
September 30 the five divisions which composed it met and overthrew twenty
German divisions, including a number of the very best troops which the enemy
retained in the field. They pushed them back over 25 miles of difficult
country, and captured 15,700 prisoners in all with 150 guns. The achievement
was the more remarkable as the troops employed were mostly young and untried,
the successors of those veterans who had laid the foundations of the great
reputation of these grand divisions. 1100 officers and 24,000 men in the list
of casualties attest the severity of the service. In estimating the work of the
latter period it is to be remembered that the Germans were in the line which
they had been taught to consider impregnable, with very heavy artillery
support, so that it is not surprising that it took six days to drive them back
4000 yards to the main outpost line, and another week to gain the Canal 2000
yards farther east. This remark applies equally to the Corps on either
side.</p>
<p>Braithwaite's Ninth Corps having passed the St. Quentin Canal in the dashing
way already described, had established itself firmly upon the other side during
the first two days of October. On October 3 it made a further forward movement
in close liaison with the Australians on the left. The two very tired divisions
which had fought incessantly for four days, the Forty-sixth on the left and the
Thirty-second on the right, were still in the van. There was some hope of a
break from these repeated hammer-blows, so the Fifth Cavalry Brigade were close
behind the infantry, waiting hopefully for the developments of the day. The
First Division on the right was told off to keep in touch with the French
Fifteenth Corps which was joining in the attack.</p>
<p>Both divisions, starting at 6.25 in the morning, made excellent progress.
Ramicourt was carried by the Midlanders in the first rush, and it had been
cleared before 7.30. By 8, Sequehart, with 200 prisoners, had fallen to the
Thirty-second Division. The final objective was the village of Montbrehain and
Mannequin Hill. On the left the Second Australian Division, advancing with
irresistible dash, had occupied Wiancourt and were making good progress towards
Beau-revoir. By 11, some of the Forty-sixth Division were on Mannequin Hill,
and some on the left were in the outskirts of Montbrehain, but the Australians
had been held up to the north of that village, which made the situation very
difficult. By 3 P.M., however, the whole of this important point had fallen,
with the large capture of 70 officers and 2000 men. There was very severe and
close fighting in the village all day, and the northern flank of the Midland
Territorials was still bare to enfilade fire, so they were drawn back to the
western outskirts, which are on the reverse slope of the hill east of
Ramicourt. At 7 P.M. the Germans counter-attacked on the British right and for
a time regained the crest of Mannequin Hill, but they were pushed off again
after dark. Another counter-attack against the Thirty-second Division about the
same hour at Sequehart was a complete failure. During the night one brigade of
the First Division and a dismounted section of the 5th Cavalry Brigade
reinforced the utterly weary Forty-sixth Division on the left. In the meantime
the French Fifteenth Corps, which had attacked with no marked success during
the day, elongated its line to the north so as to relieve the First
Division.</p>
<p>The breach made during this day's fighting in the Beaurevoir&mdash;Fonsomme
line, together with the action of the New Zealanders, presently to be
described, in keeping their grip of Crevecoeur in the north, had completely
destroyed the resistance of the last of the great organised defences of the
Hindenburg system to which the enemy had trusted as being impregnable. Officers
who went over these works immediately after the fighting were amazed at the
breadth and strength of the wire and the depth of the dug-outs and trenches.
Their final destruction was due to the action of many forces, British,
American, and Australian, all equally heroic, but the historian of the future
surveying the whole field with the detailed facts before him, will probably
agree that the outflanking forces at either end, the New Zealanders in the
north and the Englishmen of the Midland Division in the south, stand
pre-eminently out in this wonderful achievement. Sir Douglas Haig visited the
Ninth Corps on October 4 and congratulated it upon the vital work which it had
accomplished.</p>
<p>October 3 had been a day of desperate fighting for the Second Australian
Division on the left of the Ninth Corps, which had taken the place of the Fifth
Australians, while the Eighteenth British had relieved the Third. Their attack
was upon the Beau-revoir line, including the village of Beaurevoir, and though
the latter was not taken considerable progress was made. The advance was made
with Martin's 5th Brigade on the right, while the 7th Brigade (Wisdom) was in
touch with the Fiftieth British Division on the left. Sixteen tanks lumbered in
front of the line of infantry. The honours of the day rested with the 18th,
19th, and 25th Battalions, in that order from the right, who swept forward
against the formidable German position. So terrible was the fire and the wire
that the two right-hand battalions drew back and lay down while the guns were
again turned on. They then rushed the line almost before the flying fragments
of splintered wire had reached the ground. Two hundred prisoners and eighteen
machine-guns were the fruits, while the 25th on the left got the village of
Lormisset. The first phase of the action ended with the possession of the
German line from this village to the divisional boundary on the right, and the
formation of a defensive flank by the 7th Brigade, facing north. The 17th and
20th Battalions then pushed in and got Wiancourt. Altogether 11 battalions,
with an average strength of 200, were concerned in this operation, and they
took 6500 yards of double-trenched system. They lost roughly 1000 men, but
killed as many Germans, besides taking 1200 prisoners, 11 guns, and 163
machine-guns. A German officer summed up the enemy view by saying, "You
Australians are all bluff. You attack with practically no men and are on the
top of us before we know where we are."</p>
<p>The total effect of the fighting on October 3 in this section of the line
had been extraordinarily good, though all objectives had not been taken. As the
net result the British held the line for 10,000 yards from Sequehart to the
west of Beaurevoir. At one time the gains had been greater but the enemy had
countered with great valour, the Twenty-first Reserve Division, Twenty-fifth,
and One hundred and nineteenth all making very strong attacks, so that the
advanced line was retaken all along. On October 5, however, the division in the
north got Beaurevoir while the 6th Australian Brigade carried out a very
dashing attack by which the village of Montbrehain, which had already been
taken and lost, was now permanently occupied. This hard struggle was begun by
the 21st and 24th Battalions, but both were very worn, and there was not
sufficient weight and impetus to drive the attack home. It was at this crisis
that the 2nd Australian Pioneer Battalion, which had never been in action, made
a fine advance, losing 400 of its number but saving the situation and capturing
the village with 600 prisoners.</p>
<p>Immediately after this battle the Second American Corps took over the whole
line from the Australians, who retired for a rest which proved to be a final
one. So exit from the world's drama one of its most picturesque figures, the
lithe, hawk-faced, dare-devil man of the South. His record had always been
fine, and twice on a day of doom his firm ranks stood between the Empire and
absolute disaster. The end of March on the Somme, and the middle of April in
Flanders, are two crises in which every man who speaks the English tongue the
whole world over owes a deep debt of gratitude to the men who stemmed the rush
of German barbarism which might have submerged the world. But their supreme
effort lay in those last hundred days when, starting from the Abb&eacute; Wood,
west of Villers-Bretonneux and close to Amiens, they carried their line forward
in an almost constant succession of battles until they were through the last
barrier of the desperate and redoubtable enemy. The men were great; the
officers, chosen only by merit, were also great; but greatest of all, perhaps,
was their commander, Sir John Monash, a rare and compelling personality, whose
dark, flashing eyes and swarthy face might have seemed more in keeping with
some Asiatic conqueror than with the prosaic associations of a British Army. He
believed in his men, and his men believed in him, and their glorious joint
history showed that neither was deceived in the other. So exit Australia.
<i>Ave et vale!</i></p>
<p>It has been already stated that Morland's Thirteenth Corps took over the
sector which formed the left of Rawlinson's Fourth Army, after the Third Corps
which had occupied this position was drawn out for a rest and reorganisation.
The same relative positions were maintained, so that from October 1 when they
first came into action till the end of the war the Thirteenth Corps had the
Fifth Corps of the Third Army on their left, and the Australians and their
successors on their right. They came into line at that very critical moment
when the great Hindenburg Line had been broken on their south by the Americans
and Australians, but when the situation was difficult on account of a large
body of the former, the remains of the Twenty-seventh Division, being embedded
in the German lines, having advanced with such speed that the trenches had not
been cleared, so that they found themselves with as many enemies on their rear
as in their front. That under these circumstances there was no great surrender
speaks volumes for the spirit and constancy of the men.</p>
<p>The Thirteenth Corps took over Lee's seasoned Eighteenth Division from the
Third Corps. It contained also the Twenty-fifth Division (Charles), which had
been practically annihilated in the three desperate battles described in the
previous volume, but had now been rebuilt largely of men from the Italian front
where the reduction of brigades to the three-battalion scale had liberated a
number of trained and veteran soldiers. It was now commanded by General
Charles, an officer who had signalised his professional youth by riding round
the rear of the Boer army in the company of young Captain Hunter-Weston. There
was also the Fiftieth Division (Jackson) which has so often been described in
the van of the battle. It had also been reconstituted after its practical
destruction, and now contained no less than six Regular battalions from the
East, full of experience and also, unfortunately, of malaria. Finally there was
Bethell's Sixty-sixth Division, a Lancashire Territorial unit which had played
a fine part on several historic occasions. The South African Brigade now formed
part of this Division. Altogether General Morland had a sound hard-working team
under his hand, with a strong backing of artillery.</p>
<p>The Fourth Army was now across the line of the Canal de l'Escaut, but it was
necessary to clear a way for General Byng's Third Army to cross on the north.
With this object it was wise to push the attack in the south and so to outflank
the Germans that they would have to abandon the whole position. It was with
this object that the Ninth Corps and the Australians were ordered to attack on
October 3 as already described in order to secure the high ground east and
north of Beaurevoir and the villages of Montbrehain and Sequehart, while the
Thirteenth Corps conformed, pivoting on its left, and capturing, as will be
shown, the villages of Gouy and Le Catelet and the rising ground known as
Prospect Hill. The two villages which lie in a basin surrounded by hills were
powerfully held and fortified. To the west of Le Catelet the St. Quentin Canal
runs between steep banks, which rise 50 feet above the water at that part, but
come down to the normal at Vandhuile.</p>
<p>On the front of Morland's Corps only one division, the 50th, was in line,
the others being arranged in depth behind it. Sugden's 151st Brigade was on the
right in close touch with the Australians, the 149th on the left. The latter
was to hold its ground and form a hinge round which everything in the south
should swing.</p>
<p>Early on October 3 the attack started in a thick mist, which made
observation impossible&mdash;not an unmixed evil when a strong defensive
position is to be stormed. The troops went forward with splendid dash, meeting
with varied experiences as they encountered the strong posts of the enemy, but
continually getting forward, though they had not attained the level of the
Australians when about 9 A.M. the latter had occupied the
Masni&egrave;res&mdash;Beaurevoir line. The 6th Inniskilling Fusiliers who had
been told oil to take Prospect Hill had been drawn into the fighting in the
village of Gouy, but the 1st Yorkshire Light Infantry pushed in on their right
and sweeping past the village, caught up the barrage and captured the hill
which it at once consolidated. By 10 o'clock the whole of the original
objective, including both villages, had been occupied, while the Australians
were in Estr&eacute;es to the south. The rest of the day was spent, however, in
holding the new line against very vigorous counter-attacks which drove down
from the north-east and pushed the 4th King's Royal Rifles of the 150th Brigade
(Rollo), who had already lost heavily, out of Gouy. They rallied, however, and
reinforced by the 2nd Northumberland Fusiliers they restored the situation
after some heavy fighting which came to close grips among the houses. The
Second Australian Division on the right had also lost its hold of Beaurevoir
and been driven by a heavy counter-attack to Beaurevoir Mill. The night closed
down upon these lines, the British having failed to hold all their furthest
points, but having greatly enlarged their foothold on the far side of the St.
Quentin Canal, which had now been crossed and held from a point 400 yards
south-east of Vandhuile. The Fiftieth Division had used seven battalions and
incurred heavy losses, but it had won Gouy, Le Catelet, and Prospect Hill, with
some 300 prisoners. The tactical success was complete, but the strategic aim
was not yet attained, as the Germans still held the Canal in front of the Third
Army to the left. It was decided, therefore, to renew the operations at once,
bringing in the Twenty-fifth Division on the right. There was a marked salient
in the German line which included the villages of Beaurevoir and Ponchaux. The
plan was to cut in to the north and south of this salient and pinch it out. The
151st Brigade came into line on the left and Hickie's 7th Brigade of the
Twenty-fifth Division on the right, while it was arranged with General Shute on
the left that the Thirty-eighth Welsh Division should support the attack of the
151st Brigade. There were nests of trenches upon the high ground north of Gouy
and Le Catelet and these were the main obstacles in front.</p>
<p>At 6 o'clock on October 4 the attack went forward in thick fog, so thick
that it was not until 11 that the position of the Divisions could be defined.
At that hour it was learned that the right of the 7th Brigade was in the high
ground west of Ponchaux and in touch with the Australians on the Torrens Canal.
They were also holding the line of railway near the cemetery, but were under
very heavy fire from the villages which raked their position. Neither of the
villages had fallen, so that the attack on the left seemed to have miscarried.
The reports from the Fiftieth Division were that some progress had been made
towards La Pannerie, but that the left was held up by heavy fire. At 1 o'clock
La Pannerie was reported as taken, but the situation was still unsatisfactory,
and the troops were under the guns of the Germans to the north, especially from
Hargival Farm, which, however, was taken in the late afternoon. About 6 o'clock
the glad news came in from General Jackson that the enemy appeared to be
weakening, and he suggested a farther advance. This was held over until the
Welsh Division should be available, while all preparations were made for a
fresh attack upon the salient and the villages next morning.</p>
<p>At 6 A.M. on October 5 the untiring infantry were off once more, through the
usual dense obscurity which shrouds that region of marshes and canals. At 9 it
cleared. The 7th Brigade had been held on the right, but the 74th Brigade of
the Twenty-fifth Division under Craigie-Hackett, had fought its way past
Beaurevoir Mill, and its left-hand battalion, the 11th Sherwood Foresters, had
reached its objective in a sunken road north-east of Guisancourt Farm. Some
small parties were reported by the aeroplanes to be on the east side of
Beaurevoir, but the Germans were still in the village. They were fighting with
fine resolution, and a heavy counter-attack once more re-established their
line, save that Bellevue Farm remained in the hands of the 74th Brigade.
Further British efforts met with no better success, so it was decided to
reorganise and attack again at dusk. The glad news had arrived that in the
north the Welsh Division had found all clear in front of it and that the Fifth
Corps was streaming across the Canal. The Fiftieth Division then fell into
line, with the Welsh sharing in their advance. Fryell's 75th Brigade was now
assembled in the dead ground west of Beaurevoir, and about 6.30 dashed at it
with levelled bayonets and a determination which would take no denial. The
enemy were swept out of it and the line carried forward 500 yards to the east
of it, while junction was established with the Australians upon the
Estr&eacute;es&mdash;Le Cateau Road. Nearly 600 prisoners were taken during
this day. That night the Second American Corps took over from the Australians
on the right of the Thirteenth Corps.</p>
<p>There was now in front of General Morland a high waterless plateau extending
from the St. Quentin Canal to the Selle River. As it is a country of large,
open spaces intersected with sunken roads, it offers great facilities for the
use of machine-guns. It is dotted with villages nestling in their orchards, but
the wide stretches between are given over to beetroot cultivation. As the
German rearguards were still hanging on to their position, a big attack was
arranged for October 8 which would entail an advance of the Thirteenth Corps to
the Premont&mdash;Serain&mdash;Walincourt Road, meaning a depth of 6000 yards
on a 4000-yard frontage. The Twenty-fifth Division had one brigade on the right
in touch with the Americans, the Sixty-sixth were in front of Serain with two
brigades, while the Fiftieth Division with one brigade was on the left.</p>
<p>The general fight was preceded by a local attack by units of the Fiftieth
Division, at 1 o'clock in the morning of October 8, upon the strong German post
called Villers Farm which overlooked their line. This was successfully taken,
but a simultaneous attack by the Thirty-eighth Division upon the village of
Villers-Outreaux to the north was held up, with the unfortunate sequel that a
heavy German barrage fell upon the troops as they assembled for the main
attack. They endured tragic casualties with silent patience, carrying through
their preparations with absolute disregard of the shower of projectiles. The
attack was launched at 5.20, the order of brigades from the right being the
7th, the South Africans, the 198th, and the 151st.</p>
<p>This attack was a complete success. There was a stiff fight at Ponchaux, but
the village was soon carried. The whippet tanks moved up with great daring in
front of the infantry but suffered severely from shells and anti-tank rifles.
The 2nd Cavalry Brigade, who were eagerly awaiting a chance to be unleashed,
found no opening during the day. The infantry got forward finely, however, and
by 11 A.M. all objectives were held save on the front of Hunter's 198th
Brigade, which was badly handicapped by the fact that Villers-Outreaux was
still in German hands. By 3 P.M. the Fifth Corps had taken this village and the
left of the Thirteenth Corps got forward to its extreme point. The Twenty-fifth
and Sixty-sixth Divisions were at once ordered to push forward and improve the
success in every way, and the final line was from the eastern outskirts of
Premont and Serain up to the distillery on the Elincourt&mdash;Malincourt Road.
Some 800 prisoners had been taken.</p>
<p>The battle was continued on the morning of October 9 with a prompt vigour
which was amazing considering the continual exertions of the troops. It was
speedily evident that these attacks had shaken the enemy and that he had been
unable to get his roots down in his new positions. Much ground was gained with
little loss, Elincourt, Avelu, and Maretz all passing into British hands. It
was hoped at one time that the passages of the Selle River might be seized that
day, but the infantry were too exhausted and the distances too great. The
Canadian Cavalry Brigade, pressing forward in small parties, got past Reumont
and cut off some of the Germans, but larger bodies of cavalry were faced always
with murderous machine-gun fire from scattered positions. The Sixty-sixth
Division had overtaken the Canadian Cavalry before evening, and the line of the
Corps was west of Escaufort but clear of the eastern edge of Honnechy towards
Bertry Station. They were coming at last into the old battle-ground of 1914.
The wheel had swung full circle.</p>
<p>At 5.30 on October 10 these indefatigable soldiers were off again. They made
good progress until the western slopes of the Selle valley were reached. Here
the Twenty-fifth Division was checked by the fire from St. Benin, which
appeared to be strongly held. At noon the Sixty-sixth Division was in Le
Cateau, but under heavy fire from the south-west of Forest. About 2 P.M. the
74th Brigade, consisting of the 9th Yorkshires, 11th Sherwood Foresters, and
13th Durhams, made a very dashing assault upon the village of St. Benin, and
drove the enemy at the point of the bayonet across the river. It was a fine
achievement but led to no immediate advance, as the stream was unbridged and
strongly defended. The Sixty-sixth Division meanwhile attacked the ridge to the
east of Le Cateau, going forward with the 6th Connaught Rangers on the left and
the 18th King's Liverpools on the right. The Irishmen rushed the town with
great gallantry and got through to the railway cutting on the far side. The
latter battalion got as far as Montay, but found the banks of the river heavily
wired and were unable to cross. The Connaught men were ordered back, therefore,
after dusk, as both their flanks were in the air. They continued to hold the
western bank of the Selle, where it passes through the town of Le Cateau.</p>
<p>There we may leave them preparing for the important battle of the Selle
River, while we bring up the Second American and Ninth British Corps on the
right until they also are in line upon the Selle. These two Corps worked in
close liaison, forming the extreme right of the whole line of the British
Armies, which was now rolling forward in an unbroken wave more than a hundred
miles in length, gathering speed and volume as it went. Some half-cynical
Italian critic had remarked early in the war that the British may only win one
battle in a war but it is always the final one. The hour had now struck and the
line was irresistible in its cold and purposeful determination.</p>
<p>October the 8th was a great day of battle, in which the Second Americans on
the left, the Ninth British in the centre, and the Fifteenth French on the
right were all heavily engaged, the men advancing with ardour from the
knowledge that at last the open land of France lay before them, and that the
nightmares of barbed wire and permanent lines were behind. Taking the line from
the north, the immediate object of the Americans was to capture Brancourt and
Premont, including a total advance of 6000 yards. The attack was made by the
59th Brigade of the Thirtieth Division, with the 60th Brigade in support. The
advance was supported by a number of heavy tanks and of whippets. The
machine-guns were numerous and deadly, but the Americans would take no denial,
fighting with that grim earnestness which is as much their national
characteristic in battle, as is the d&eacute;bonnaire light-heartedness of the
British, or the exalted abandonment of the French. By evening both villages had
fallen and all objectives attained. Early next morning the 59th American
Brigade advanced once more, maintaining the fight until the early afternoon
when the 60th American Brigade passed through their thin ranks, taking the
towns of Busigny and Becquigny. To carry on a connected narrative of the
American Corps it may be added that they were still attacking on October 10,
endeavouring to secure the command of the Selle River and the high ground
beyond. The 119th American Regiment in the north captured Escaufort and St.
Souplet, and in collaboration with Morland's Corps got possession of St. Benin
in face of a very hot fire. Finally the 119th Regiment forced its way to the
western bank of the Selle. The 120th American Regiment on the right had been
checked by enfilade fire near Vaux Andigny, and had to throw out a defensive
line to the south, being for the moment ahead of the general line. This
regiment had suffered very heavily in its fine advance, and it was relieved on
the early morning of October 11 by the 118th Regiment, who found their comrades
so stretched out that they were covering a front of 5000 yards. The left
American sector then remained stationary, but the 118th Regiment swept forward
and took at the point of the bayonet the villages of Vaux Andigny and La Haie
Manneresse, making an advance of 1000 yards. That night the Twenty-seventh
Division came forward and relieved the Thirtieth. We shall now return and
follow the movements of the Ninth Corps on the right during these five days of
battle.</p>
<p>This Corps had joined vigorously in the attack on October 8, advancing with
the 71st Brigade of the Sixth Division on the left, the 16th Brigade in the
centre, and the 139th Sherwood Foresters Brigade on the right, the function of
the latter being to keep in touch with the French. The line sped forward
without a check for 2000 yards, a squadron of whippets leading them gallantly
on. The 16th Brigade had the hardest task, but they forced their way eastwards,
and by midday Mannequin and Doon Hills with Beauregard Farm were all within the
British lines. The cavalry tried to get through, but the machine-guns were
still their masters, and it could only have been done at the cost of
unjustifiable losses. Cerise Wood was a serious obstacle, but the resistance
there suddenly collapsed before the stern insistence of the 16th Brigade, and
190 prisoners gave themselves up. Mericourt also was taken. Out of Mannequin
Wood 200 more Germans were extracted. Altogether it was a very successful day,
as 4 guns, 35 machine-guns, and 1200 prisoners remained with the victors. The
Corps line on the left was well forward on its objectives, though on the right
the advance had not been as far as was expected.</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the right the Forty-sixth Division was put in between
the Sixth Division on the left and the French. With this greater weight of
attack things went very much better on October 9. The new-comers captured
Fresnoy-le-Grand, while the Sixth Division took J onnecourt Farm which had been
a lion in the path upon the previous day. A railway lay across the front and
the Germans tried to build up a fresh line upon it, but in the afternoon they
had lost their grip. The usual organised retreat of the Germans showed signs
now of hurry and demoralisation. Late in the evening the Sixth Division
occupied Bohain, which was found to contain several thousands of civilians,
many of whom had not touched food for three days, but who forgot their hunger
in the joys of liberty.</p>
<p>The next day, October 10, the whole Corps front was moving forward, but
resistance thickened as it advanced, and finally in the evening they appeared
to be once more faced by an organised line of battle. The Sixth Division was
now in touch with the Thirtieth Americans at Vaux Andigny. On October 11 a
fresh German division, the Fifth Reserve, had come into line, and it was very
difficult to get forward in face of their fire. The casualties were low,
however, and indeed it may be remarked that the greater tactical skill acquired
by years of practice showed itself now, not merely by the defeat of the enemy
but also by the cheapness of the cost. The iron front of the tank took many a
bullet which in earlier days would have found the breast of the stormer, for
brain work in England had come to the aid of valour in France. Up to now, in
all these momentous operations from the 18th of September, the total casualties
of the Ninth Corps had only been 6000, less than those of many a futile trench
attack in the early years. On the other hand their prisoners were 12,000, a
most remarkable record.</p>

<h2><a id="chap7" name="chap7">VII. THE OPERATIONS OF RAWLINSON'S FOURTH
ARMY</a><br>
From the Battle of the Selle, October 17, to the end</h2>
<p class="chaphead">Attack upon the line of the Selle River&mdash;Stubborn work
by the Second American Corps&mdash;Success of the Ninth Corps&mdash;Hard
fighting at Le Cateau&mdash;Great feat of the South Africans&mdash;Continued
advance&mdash;Delay-action mines&mdash;Capture of Landrecies&mdash;Dramatic
exit of the German machine-gunner&mdash;Splendid work of the First
Division.</p>
<p class="first">THERE was a pause now on the front of the Fourth Army, and a
period for preparation and reorganisation which was badly needed after the
rapid and unremitting advance. The Selle River in front of the American section
of the line had been carefully reconnoitred and was found to be fordable except
for occasional deep holes. The position opposite to this Corps was very
difficult, the enemy holding the east bank strongly, with outposts near St.
Souplet in the north and Molain in the south. Across the stream and parallel
with it was the railway, which had an embankment rising in places as high as
thirty feet. Behind the railway was rising ground.</p>
<p>The Americans attacked with both their divisions in the line, the Thirtieth
being on the right. The 301st American Tank Battalion led them on. The attack
was on a three-brigade front, the Twenty-seventh Division having both its units
in the fighting line. It should be explained that an American division has only
two brigades as against the three in the British system, but that each brigade
is very much stronger, consisting nominally of 6000 bayonets. These particular
brigades, however, were already very worn, and a great strain was thrown upon
them by the failure of the reinforcing organisation which, for some reason, had
been unable to make good the very serious casualties already incurred.</p>
<p>The battle began at 5.20 in the morning of October 17. The left of the
American line had its jumping-off place in the partially destroyed village of
St. Souplet, and it was no easy matter to get forward from the beginning. None
the less the whole line fought its way across the stream and up to the high
railway embankment beyond. This, as in the area of the Thirteenth Corps, proved
to be a very formidable obstacle, the more so as the fog made cohesion of
attack and accurate observation equally impossible. Bandoval Farm on the left
of the line poured out a destructive volume of machine-gun fire, but it was
eventually rushed by the American Infantry. The right of the Twenty-seventh
Division got the village of Arbre Guernon. The difficulties of this unit were
greatly increased by the fact that their tanks could not ford the stream, and
though it had been arranged that they should join them from the south, where
there was a crossing, only two did eventually arrive, both of which were
destroyed by shell-fire. In spite of everything, however, the Twenty-seventh
Division fought their way forward to the Le Cateau&mdash;Arbre Guernon Road,
where they finally halted, as both of their flanks were, for the moment, in the
air.</p>
<p>The Thirtieth American Division had encountered a fierce resistance from the
start at the villages of Molain and St. Martin, so that they were held up in
crossing the river. After taking these villages they were faced by heavy fire
from the ridge across the river. They formed a defensive flank, however, up to
the point which their comrades had reached on the left. The total achievement
of the Second American Corps was a fine one, for their prisoners amounted to
nearly 1500 men, while their front had been advanced for 4000 yards.</p>
<p>Next morning, October 18, the attack was renewed by General Read, the
Thirtieth Division bringing up the 60th Brigade which had been in reserve on
the day before. In front of it was a line of well-fortified villages, two of
which, Ribeauville and Ecaillon, were captured before evening, while a third,
Mazinghien, was ringed round and American patrols were in the streets. This
success represented a further advance of 1500 yards. The last-named village was
completely cleared by the bayonet on the morning of October 19 and the advance
was carried on for a further distance of 3000 yards. The objective of this
day's attack was the high ground overlooking the Canal, and by night the west
slope of this ridge had been reached all along the divisional front.</p>
<p>The Twenty-seventh Division had advanced on the left and had taken
Jonqui&egrave;re Farm, pushing its patrols across the St. Maurice River and up
to the ridge beyond, behind which lay Le Catillon. A pause was now ordered
while fresh dispositions were made all along the British front, and during this
pause the two American divisions, which had fought a succession of severe
actions ever since September 27, were drawn out. Their losses had been very
heavy, and as already stated no replacements had been received. In their term
of service the Second American Corps had taken 81 German guns, 6000 prisoners,
and a large amount of material, while their own casualties amounted to the very
honourable total of 364 officers and 12,826 men. They left the line with the
deep respect and affection of their British comrades, who well appreciated the
difficulties which newcomers, however brave, must meet with in work which calls
for so terrible an apprenticeship.</p>
<p>We will now return to the operations of the Ninth Corps, on the right flank
of the Americans, from October 17 onwards. The action was started with the
Forty-sixth Division on the right and the Sixth on the left, while the First
Division was in close support, ready to come through when needed. A great
forest lay on their front and the general idea was that the Ninth Corps should
encircle this from the north and join beyond the wood with the Fifteenth French
Corps, General Braithwaite coming forward with his headquarters to the
immediate rear of the battle so as to keep control of what would be a delicate
and difficult operation. One battalion of the 139th Brigade, attacking on the
right of the British line, lost its direction in the fog and got into so false
a position that upon the fog suddenly lifting it was exposed to very heavy loss
from the German machine-guns. The splendid Sherwood Foresters have seldom had a
more severe ordeal. The left of the battalion swung round, however, and changed
direction, with the result that the situation was restored. Without any loss of
spirit the brigade rushed on and captured Regnicourt, driving back a heavy
counter-attack which rolled in from the east about 11.30. The other three
brigades in the line, which were, counting from the right, the 138th, 18th, and
16th, all made good progress, though in the fog they left several lively
machine-guns in their rear. Each captured all the objectives in front,
including the wood of St. Pierre.</p>
<p>The First Division was now coming up behind the Sixth with the intention of
passing through them, but they ran into very heavy fire before they had reached
their allotted positions. Both the 1st and 2nd Brigades had to advance for 2000
yards under the constant thrashing of the machine-guns, in spite of which these
veteran battalions maintained their cohesion and direction, arriving at their
starting-point in the battle line at the time arranged. Passing through the
Sixth Division they continued the advance, with the 1st Brigade on the right
and the 2nd in touch with the Americans on the left. The village of La
Vall&eacute;e Mulatre was very sternly defended, but nothing could stop the
fire of the attack, and by 2.30 it had been entirely occupied. The Forty-sixth
Division on the right had fought their way through the woody country, and had
finally completed the whole scheme by joining hands with the French at the
outskirts of the great For&ecirc;t Domanial just north-west of Mennevret. It
was a good day for the Ninth Corps, and the prisoners amounted to 150 officers
and 1500 men, a proportion of officers which suggests that the demoralisation
of the German Army had not stopped at the ranks. Among the prisoners were
samples from 6 divisions, 13 regiments, and 31 battalions, indicating the
urgency with which reinforcements had been hurried up to prevent a complete
fracture of the line.</p>
<p>In the early morning of October 18 the Forty-sixth Division in co-operation
with the French captured Mennevret and Le Repas. On the same morning the 3rd
Brigade advanced in co-operation with the Americans on the left and pushed the
line forward as far as Ribeauville. The French had come on well in the south
and were now in touch with the 1st Brigade, while the Forty-sixth and Sixth
Divisions were drawn out of the line. By evening on October 19 the First
Division had made its way forward and was lining the western bank of the Canal.
The Sixth Division now came in again on the left, and got touch with the
Thirteenth Corps, thus covering the gap left by the withdrawal of the
Americans.</p>
<p>Returning to the Thirteenth Corps, who were on the left of the Fourth Army
at the battle of the Selle River on October 17, the weary Twenty-fifth Division
had been drawn into reserve, while the Fiftieth, their heavy losses made good
by reinforcements, were put into the right of the line once more, while the
Sixty-sixth carried on to the left. The river was at once reconnoitred and
found to be a serious impediment, especially in the immediate neighbourhood of
Le Cateau, where it had been dammed and deepened, while it was commanded by
high ground in the east and also by numerous strongly-built houses in the town.
Arrangements were made, therefore, that the main attack should be lower down
where the facilities were greater. The Fiftieth Division held this right
sector, with St. Souplet as its southern limit for the 151st Brigade, while the
149th was near St. Benin. The Sixty-sixth covered the ground up to Le Cateau,
the South African Brigade under General Tanner being north of the town. The
South Africans with great skill and daring arranged their assembly within fifty
yards of the German outposts on the other side of the stream, at a point where
they were absolutely commanded by the German guns in case of discovery. There
they lay in silence until, at the first twinkle of dawn, they sprang to their
feet and rushed forward to the eight bridges which the sappers with their usual
splendid efficiency had prepared for them during the night. So well had the
bridge-makers worked, that in the region of the main attack they had actually
been able to throw across bridges which would carry forward the ten tanks
allotted for the assault.</p>
<p>The fog was so dense and the communications so precarious that the officers
in charge of the operations had the nerve-trying experience of seeing their
whole force vanish into the gloom and knowing nothing of what had become of
them, save that the deafening roar of guns told of a deadly struggle. Soon
there came news of disasters to the tanks. Three drove into a morass and were
embedded there. Two developed engine trouble and collapsed. One never got
across. The others lost their place in the fog and all hope of useful
co-operation with the infantry was at an end. Then came belated news of the
storm troops. The leading battalions of the Fiftieth Division had got across in
safety but had been swallowed up in the fog, shrouding several German posts
containing machine-guns, which opened on the supports after the front files had
passed them. On the left the formidable obstacle of the station with its heavy
loop-holed out-buildings held up the flank battalion of the 151st Brigade, and
the whole advance was stopped and greatly disorganised at this point. The
railway was a strong line of German resistance, and especially a wooded mound
on its eastern side, which bristled with guns. The attack being held, the
reserve of the Fiftieth Division, the 150th Brigade, was thrown into the fight
which in the early afternoon was still in a condition of equilibrium.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile a great deed of arms had been wrought in the northern part
of the line. Tanner's South African Brigade, having reached the eastern bank of
the river, had penetrated the German wire and stormed through the fog up the
hill on the north of the town. The second wave was held by the concentrated
fire, and the first wave was so utterly lost that the patrols could find no
trace of where it had got to. Just as all hope had been given up, and it had
been arranged to restart the barrage, a brave runner got through with the news
that the leading South Africans were right through the town and engaged in a
desperate hand-to-hand fight in the deep cutting on the farther side. In order
to reach this place they had been compelled to force their way through another
broad apron of untouched wire, a most remarkable achievement. Gradually the
very strenuous German resistance was overcome, small bodies of South Africans
dribbling up in support of their comrades. By noon this part of the German line
had fallen, with a corresponding weakening along the rest of their front, for
the bravest man is less brave when he begins to think that the day is already
lost and that his self-sacrifice is manifestly vain.</p>
<p>With a view to helping the Fiftieth Division the 198th Brigade of the
Sixty-sixth was now ordered to cross the river to the south of the town, and to
strike in on the left of the long-drawn struggle at the station, where the
assailants were now so mixed up that the two brigades were telescoped into one
and all battalion order had been lost. A strong counter-attack had developed
about 3 o'clock on the right of the line, where the British and American Corps
joined, and this had some success, though the 4th King's Royal Rifles held on
desperately to their ground. It was necessary to send in the 150th Brigade to
steady the line. The 7th Wiltshires and the Munster Fusiliers were the
reinforcing battalions and by their aid the position was once more restored. It
was a dangerous crisis, for with the river in the rear any sort of retreat
would have been disastrous.</p>
<p>There was now a concentrated bombardment of the obdurate station, and this
seems to have broken down finally the spirit of the brave defenders. Shortly
after dusk patrols forced their way into the buildings, and by 8 P.M. the whole
place was in British hands, and Le Cateau, save for the extreme eastern
outskirt, was cleared of the enemy. It had been a very desperate battle, the
laurels of which rest with the South African Brigade, who had carried out so
remarkable an assault, and also with the Fiftieth Division which had held on
with such a bulldog grip to its purpose.</p>
<p>The day's work had not been quite completed, as the neighbouring village of
Bazuel had not been captured, and this was undertaken on October 18 by the
Fiftieth Division, strengthened by the inclusion of the 75th Brigade. This
operation was carried out with perfect success. There was considerable
opposition from scattered machine-gun posts, but before noon Bazuel and the
whole ridge to the east of Le Cateau had been secured, while the Sixty-sixth
Division had cleared up the suburbs of the town. Thus the whole capture and
command of the Selle River had been triumphantly accomplished. To get a
complete view of the battle these operations are to be read in connection with
the fighting of the Third Army, as later recounted, on the left, and that of
the remainder of the Fourth Army on the right.</p>
<p>After a pause of a few days for reorganisation and readjustment the active
operations of the Thirteenth Corps were resumed in the country between the
Selle and Mormal Forest, a district which was less open than the plains to the
west, but presented special difficulties of its own, for it was well wooded and
was also cut up into numerous small compounds with thick hedges which presented
serious obstacles to any advance. However, the obstacle had never yet been
found in France or Belgium which would stop a British Army, so the troops moved
forward with a high heart to this new attack. The Ninth British Corps had taken
the place of the Americans on the right, and was to advance to the line of the
Sambre and Oise Canal, while the Thirteenth, in conjunction with the Fifth
Corps of the Third Army on the left was to reach the main Le
Quesnoy&mdash;Landrecies Road, near the western edge of Mormal Forest. The
larger aspect of this movement was that it should cover the right flank of the
Third Army while it carried out its own important attack.</p>
<p>The attack was launched in bright moonlight at 1.20 in the morning of
October 23. The 7th Brigade advanced on the right, with the 53rd and 54th
Brigades of the Eighteenth Division in the order given on its left. The first
objective was the village of Pommereuil, and it was attained in the face of
heavy fire from the mills and farms along the banks of the Richemont River. On
the right the 7th West Kents did particularly well, especially an independent
company under Captain MacDonald which attacked with such vigour that it
captured Garde Hill and Garde Copse, extending its gains outside the divisional
area, and taking many prisoners. The 10th Essex and 2nd Bedfords were also in
the leading line. The second objective facing the Eighteenth Division was Les
Tilleuls Farm, with the great Bois l'&Eacute;v&ecirc;que beyond it, which
covered four square miles. By 9 o'clock the Eighteenth Division had got the
farm and was established in the north-east corner of the wood. Wood's 55th
Brigade coming through had got well forward and was advancing upon the village
of Bousies in close co-operation with the Thirty-third Division of the Fifth
Corps. By 11.30 the Twenty-fifth Division was also in Bois
l'&Eacute;v&ecirc;que and the British infantry was crashing through the
brushwood which makes up the greater part of the plantation. All these various
points were made good, but it was found that beyond them the enemy had a fixed
line of defence with wire and every other defensive arrangement, so, as the
soldiers were much exhausted from a long day's labour, the attack was pushed no
further. Bousies had been taken after a hard fight among the surrounding
orchards, by those old battle-comrades, the 7th Buffs and 8th East Surreys of
the 55th Brigade, and the woods were completely cleared. Two field-guns had
been captured near the Richemont River, and the bodies of 30 men of the 8th
Royal Berks within 60 yards of their muzzles showed how fierce had been both
attack and defence. Altogether 50 guns and nearly 1000 prisoners had been
taken.</p>
<p>The attack was resumed before dawn on October 24. On the right, the village
of Malgarni was the first objective and this was carried and passed by the 74th
Brigade. Fontaine-aux-Bois was also captured, but the Germans held part of
their line on the Englefontaine&mdash;Landrecies Road and could not be
dislodged. On the left, the Eighteenth Division, using the same brigades as the
evening before, took Robersart and some scattered farms, but had to fight very
hard for everything they got. The 7th Queen's were the first into the captured
village. The new ground was consolidated and patrols thrown out to report any
weakening of the enemy line. That night General Wood, who had done such long
and fine service with the 55th Brigade, was invalided and Colonel Irwin of the
East Surreys took over the command.</p>
<p>On October 26, a day of rain and mist, the Fifth Corps was attacking
Englefontaine, and the Eighteenth Division conformed by throwing forward its
left, which involved the 7th West Kents and 8th Berkshires in some hard
fighting. Much work was thrown upon the Thirteenth Corps on this and the
following days in evacuating the civilians who swarmed in the villages, and who
had no protection against the noxious fumes of the gas shells which the Germans
with their usual thorough-going brutality showered amongst them. If in the
peace terms the Germans found that the hearts of the Allies were hard and their
thoughts stern, they have only to read the details of their own military
history in order to understand the reasons.</p>
<p>A very large attack had now been planned in which the First French Army, the
Fourth, Third, and a portion of the First British Armies should all
participate. The Germans were known to be tottering and one more good blow
might bring them down. It was necessary to act at once, for the German
delay-action mines, which were usually in the shape of one shell set to explode
among a dump of shells by the road or railway, were making the communications
almost impossible. Fortunately the ingenuity of the British sappers discovered
the private mark&mdash;a small star upon the cap of the fuse&mdash;by which the
danger-shell could be distinguished among its neighbours, and so many a
disaster was averted. It should be mentioned that on October 30 two gallant
senior officers of the gunners, Colonels Thorpe and Burnyeat, were both killed
by the same shell.</p>
<p>The general line of advance of the Fourth Army, which had been north-east,
was now changed to east. The orders given to the Thirteenth Corps were to
advance in that direction, astride of the Sambre and Oise Canal, to the line of
the Cartignies&mdash;Dompierre&mdash;Bavai Road. The Ninth Corps was to cross
the Canal simultaneously on the right of the Thirteenth at Catillon and Ors,
advancing on the same objective. The general proposition before the Thirteenth
Corps was a total advance of about ten miles, part of it through the south end
of Mormal Forest, with the forcing of the Canal crossings thrown in.</p>
<p>The frontage of the Corps attack was 7500 yards, narrowing down as it
advanced, so three divisions were put into the line. On the right was the
Twenty-fifth Division, with the task of forcing the passage of the Canal
opposite Landrecies, of capturing that town, and of clearing the country up to
Maroilles. The Sixty-sixth Division was then to carry on the advance to the
ultimate objective.</p>
<p>The Fiftieth Division was in the centre and was to fight a way through
Mormal Forest, while the Eighteenth Division on the left was to storm the
village of Sassegnies. The desperate determination of the Army may be gauged
from the fact that a large number of life-belts were served out to the leading
brigade in case it should be necessary to swim the Canal for want of
bridges.</p>
<p>The attack, the last great concerted movement of the war, was launched at
6.15 in the morning of November 4&mdash;a day of thick, all-pervading mist. The
order of brigades from right to left in the initial advance was 75, 149, 150,
54, and 53. Good progress was made from the beginning all along the line, and
the news from the Ninth Corps was uplifting. They were across south of Catillon
and Ors, but the Thirty-second Division, on the immediate right of the
Twenty-fifth Division, had been held up, so that they were ordered to move
south and pass by the crossings already established. The Twenty-fifth and
Fiftieth Divisions both got well away, the former at 9 A.M. being within 300
yards of Landrecies, while the latter was well up to the old bugbear, the
Englefontaine&mdash;Landrecies Road, though Robinson's 149th Brigade, and
especially the 13th Black Watch, had lost heavily. The Eighteenth Division had
also attained its first objectives and drove off a half-hearted counter-attack.
The 7th West Kents had a desperate house-to-house fight in the village of Hecq,
which remained in their hands, while the 2nd Bed-fords had a similar hard
victory in Preux, where they were much helped by the 10th Essex.</p>
<p>The 75th Brigade had forced its way down to the Canal bank. The 5th
Gloucesters had the good fortune to discover two German foot-bridges and poured
across. It was indeed a proof of German deterioration that such an oversight
should have occurred, for it is in attention to detail that the merit of German
soldiering lies. The 8th Worcesters followed their comrades and these two
battalions began to encircle the town from the south. There was no bridge
higher up the Canal, but a fine feat of arms was performed by a small party of
the 122nd Tunnelling Company, who dashed forward, seized the lock gates, and
cut the wires which were meant to blow them up. On the extreme left some of the
1/8 Warwicks discovered another forgotten bridge and pushed across to the north
of the town, which was now practically surrounded so that the garrison was soon
taken or killed. The official report remarks: "The capture of t andrecies was
an operation which might well have absorbed the energies of a whole division.
Success was accomplished with a single brigade and was due to the spirited
leading of the officers, the bravery of the troops, and that element of good
fortune which any well-planned and boldly-executed enterprise deserves."</p>
<p>The Eighteenth and Fiftieth Divisions had pushed on through the forest with
hardly a check and surrounded a considerable number of Germans, who for the
most part put up a very resolute resistance. About two o'clock there were
signs, however, that the whole line was shaking, but it was impossible to
advance farther until the Ninth Corps was in line. The final position on this
most successful day was east of Landrecies, through Le Preseau, along the west
bank of the Sambre to Hachette, and on to Locquignol.</p>
<p>It was guessed that the enemy was in a bad way, but on this evening it was
confirmed by the capture of a cavalry orderly bearing a message ordering the
troops to withdraw to the Sambre during the night, and to continue the
retirement upon Maubeuge. Their skeleton rearguards still hung on, however, and
put up a spirited resistance. Next morning, November 5, the corps advanced once
more, the 74th Brigade taking La Rosi&egrave;re, while Maroilles fell before
noon to the same division. The Eighteenth Division had pushed ahead and
occupied Sassegnies, while the Fifth Corps were in Berlaimont on their left and
were crossing the Sambre. The Fiftieth Division had more difficulty as the
ground was very water-logged and the resistance considerable. The day's advance
finished by the 74th Brigade, still in the van, capturing Basse Noyelle, while
at dusk the 149th Brigade got across the Grande Helpe, a stream behind which
the Germans were expected to build up a new line.</p>
<p>A steady advance was maintained next morning, November 6, though the
constant tapping of machine-guns in front told of the German sporadic
resistance. That night the line of the Thirteenth Corps was east of Marbaix and
Dompierre. It was found that the small enclosed fields were very helpful in
dealing with German machine-guns, as a concealed flank attack could always be
carried out. Armoured cars on the roads were also found to be of great help to
the infantry. On November 8 there was a sharp fight on the line of the
Avesnes&mdash;Maubeuge Road. After the road was won there was a very spirited
counter-attack, the German machine-gunners coming forward with great heart,
though the infantry would not face the fire. The 6th Inniskilling Fusiliers and
1st Yorkshire Light Infantry bore the brunt of this engagement, which lasted
several hours.</p>
<p>The state of supplies made it impossible for the Corps to advance farther,
but the 12th Lancers went on as cavalry, supported by small mobile columns. A
line was reached which ran north and south through Hestrud, and this proved to
be the farthest east of the Thirteenth Corps, as it was gathering itself there
for an attack when the final white flag was hoisted. Up to the last moment
there was local skirmishing and even a small German attack, which was driven
back and added a few more to the monstrous death-roll of the war. The whole
British Army has an admiration for the German machine-gunner, and one closing
incident of the war may be recorded. At two minutes from the moment of the
Armistice a machine-gun opened up about 200 yards from the British line, and
fired a whole belt without a pause. The gunner was then seen to stand up beside
his weapon, take off his helmet, bow, and turning about walk slowly to the
rear. In his person there vanished from the stage a brave and formidable
character in the war. His last action was as typical of the remorseless valour
of his corps as that of the British infantry who refrained from shooting him
was characteristic of their chivalrous and sporting instincts. When the hour of
fate struck, the line of the vanguard of the Thirteenth Corps was just west of
Montbliart and Sautain, being the most eastern point of any troops in the
British Armies in France.</p>
<p>During the five weeks that Morland's Corps had been in the line it had
captured 8554 prisoners and 340 guns, while its take of machine-guns was at
least 2500. It had engaged units of no less than forty-four divisions, which
gives a vivid idea of the state of disruption which the German Army had
reached. From thirteen of these divisions prisoners varying from 100 to 1000
had been taken, showing that these at least had been substantially engaged.</p>
<p>Having brought Morland's Thirteenth Corps to the goal of all its hopes and
efforts, we shall now turn back to the days after the battle of the Selle River
and carry the Ninth Corps on the right on to the same goal.</p>
<p>On October 23 broke out the general engagement which will be known as the
battle of the Oise&mdash;Sambre Canal. The order of battle of the Ninth Corps
on this day was the First Division on the right, with the 2nd and 3rd Brigades
in the line, and the Sixth Division on the left, with the 18th and 71st in the
line. It was a night attack launched at 1 in the morning, and though a heavy
German barrage, mixed with gas, beat upon it, none the less both divisions made
good progress at first, though many obstinate strong points had to be reduced.
By 8 in the morning the First Division was reported as being on all its
objectives from Catillon southwards, with patrols pushed into the town. The
Sixth Division had great difficulty on its left flank while endeavouring to
clear Bois l'&Eacute;v&ecirc;que, but late in the afternoon they got forward
again. It was clear by night, however, that the Germans, who were battling
hard, still held some parts of the west bank of the Canal, including Catillon
and Ors. Next morning the Sixth Division, working in close liaison with the
Twenty-fifth Division on the flank of Morland's Corps, got well forward, but
were still short of their full objective on the left. Every day after this in a
series of minor operations the Corps improved its footing on the west side of
this great obstacle, which was of a most formidable nature, 60 feet wide,
unfordable, with steep slippery banks and wire mixed with wooden abattis along
the farther edge. Such was the new line of defence behind which the German Army
had raffled, and which offered a fresh problem to the victorious British
leaders.</p>
<p>Most of the western bank had been occupied by November 2, including the
village of Ors, but there were points where deep marshes and German redoubts on
this side had prevented the assailants from reaching the edge of the Canal.
There was also a spur at the bend of the Canal which enfiladed the line, but
this was taken as a preliminary operation by the Thirty-second Division. It was
retaken, however, by the Germans in a very strong counter-attack supported by
an overwhelming drum-fire. On November 3 the British again got the spur known
as Happe-Garbes, but once again in the afternoon of the same day the Germans
regained it in a very determined advance. This heavy fighting fell upon the
96th Brigade and specially upon the 15th Lancashire Fusiliers, who were exposed
to great pressure all day. Among many brave records that of Sergeant John
Clarke of this battalion is pre-eminent, who took four machine-guns
single-handed, bayoneting the crews, and fighting with desperate courage at the
head of his platoon from morning till night. The idea of capturing the place
before the general attack of November 4 was then given up, and other steps were
taken to neutralise it. The main crossing of the Canal was planned to be at
Ors, just south of Ors, and at two other points.</p>
<p>This the last great battle of the war broke out as already stated at 5.45 on
November 4, the infantry advance being covered by a tremendous barrage. The
First Division attacked on the right, the Thirty-second on the left, while the
Forty-sixth was in close support. On the left and in the centre of the
Thirty-second Division two bridges were thrown across the Canal under intense
machine-gun fire, only to be destroyed immediately, before any large number of
troops could get across. On the right of the division, however, the 14th
Brigade gained a considerable success, the 1st Dorsets getting across over a
bridge of kerosene tins which was most cleverly constructed by the Engineers
and laid down in the darkness and mist, so that it was a complete surprise to
the enemy. A smoke barrage and a concentration of machine-guns helped the
stormers to get across. No praise can be too great for the sappers who worked
amid clouds of poison gas in the completion of this essential bridge upon which
the fate of the battle might depend. To one of them, Sapper Adams, of the 21st
Field Company, the V.C. was awarded, but there was not a man round him who did
not deserve the same honour.</p>
<p>In the meantime the First Division had advanced under cover of a thick mist,
and four bridges having been thrown across, the two leading battalions got over
the Canal, just escaping the German barrage which came roaring down behind
them. The further experiences of this division, and especially of the 3rd
Brigade at Catillon, should be told in some detail.</p>
<p>A special task was assigned to the brigade, which was to clear the outlying
portion of the town, to occupy the rest of it, and to force the crossing of the
Sambre Canal at the broken bridge. The order of the battalions on the east side
of the Canal was that the 2nd Welsh were on the right, the` 1st Gloucesters in
the centre, and the 1st South Wales Borderers on the left, good old comrades
who had fought together from the first. There were still strong enemy posts on
the west of the Canal, and the enemy had fought tenaciously for every inch of
ground. On the far side of the Canal were many houses which contained
machine-guns, and their fire was always heavy and accurate. The actual attack
upon the town began at 5.45 in the morning of November 4, and was carried out
in the midst of a very dense fog by the 1st Gloucesters under Major Guild. The
portion of the town to the west of the bridge was first conquered, with the
efficient aid of an aggressive tank. Many machine-guns were taken in the
suburban orchards and in the town itself. The bridge was commanded by a heavy
machine-gun, but its position was spotted and the tank put it out of action by
accurate fire. The British barrage was falling thickly across the Canal, and
the British regimental leaders, those wonderful men on the spot who adapt
themselves to every emergency, crossed at once, so that when the Germans
emerged from their cellars as the barrage lifted they were received into the
expectant arms of the Gloucesters. Over a hundred were taken at this spot. The
battalion then, having formed a bridge-head, pushed on through the town,
mopping up as they went, while the Welshmen cleared the orchards on both sides.
The captures in this well-managed affair amounted altogether to 550 Germans,
while of the British only 70 casualties were reported. No less than ten
different German regiments were identified by the 2nd Brigade during this
operation, which indicates how mixed and broken the hostile army had become
under the constant pounding.</p>
<p>At the same time as the 3rd Brigade were capturing Catillon, the 2nd Brigade
on their right had shown great gallantry in forcing their section of the Canal.
They had been ordered to cross by a lock south of the town, but it was a
desperate business, for the lock itself was hard to reach, with banks and water
in front of it, all strenuously defended. The infantry, with their attendant
bridging parties of sappers, were held up for a time, but Colonel Johnson of
the 2nd Sussex restored the situation, personally leading the assault forward.
It was again checked by the hurricane of fire, but he again rallied it and
eventually led it across. In the subsequent official report attached to his
V.C., it was stated that the offensive spirit that he had inspired in his
Sussex men was entirely responsible for the successful crossing.</p>
<p>By 8.45 the Thirty-second Division reported that their right brigade had got
across, but owing to the enfilade fire two battalions of the left brigade had
been unable to do the same. About midday, however, they were all over and had
established themselves in a position south-west of Landrecies. The First
Division was now touching Mezi&egrave;res with its left, where it was pushing
on to Fesmy, while the German line seemed to be dissolving in front of it. It
was a great day for the old division which had fought so gallantly from the
first gunshot of the war to this which was so nearly the last one. Much of the
credit of the victory is due to General Cartwright, the Corps Engineer, upon
whom the weight of these various arrangements had fallen.</p>
<p>The Germans were now so fluid that a light cavalry screen was pushed out in
front of the Corps, and the Forty-sixth Division advanced on November 5 behind
it. By 9 A.M. the Thirty-second Division was in Favril, in touch with the
Twenty-fifth on their left. Late on November 6 Cartignies was occupied. The
advance rolled forward without serious interruption, though there was some
bickering round Avesnes, and on November 8 the Thirty-second Division was
established upon the high ground east of that town. At this time, as already
recorded, the operations of the Fourth Army were confined to the single mobile
column commanded by General Bethell, which was all that could be sent forward
on account of the want of every sort of supply. Two days later came the sudden
news of the signing of the Armistice. Never was there so sudden and wonderful a
change. From dark cloud to bright sunshine seemed to have been the work of an
hour. The long hurricane had blown out at last and left only the weals across
the country which marked its passage. British officers have recorded how they
sped eastwards in motor cars, and noted as far as the eye could range the white
flags of joy and enfranchisement flying from the farm-houses and the village
spires. The only signs of the invaders were the litter of abandoned equipment,
lorries, and guns along the roads. For many a week, however, they left terrible
marks of their passage in their delay-action mines, which, with their usual
ruthless and reckless brutality, they had left in railway stations and other
crowded points along the line of their operations, and which exploded long
after the Armistice had been declared. This also was weighed against them in
the day of doom, but indeed the scale was already overfull, and nothing which
they could do could add to the horror and detestation with which they were
regarded by the world, or to the absolute determination that they should never
again raise their heads&mdash;or at least that those heads should never be
crowned by the helmet of war. Such was the ultimate result of the doctrine of
the Superman, of might is right, and of the whole material philosophy which had
emanated from Frederick, miscalled the Great, and poisoned all Central
Europe.</p>
<p>So ended the splendid work of Braithwaite's Ninth Corps. Its total advance
since September 18 had been 50 miles, during which time it had captured nearly
17,000 prisoners and 318 guns.</p>

From the Battle of the Hindenburg Line (September 29)<br>
to the Battle of the Selle (October 17)</h2>
<p class="chaphead">Fighting at L'Escaut Canal&mdash;Dash of the New
Zealanders&mdash;The Guards in a hot corner&mdash;Crossing of the
Canal&mdash;Back on the old ground&mdash;Great work by all four Corps of the
Third Army.</p>
<p class="first">HAVING for the sake of continuous narrative carried the Fourth
Army to the end of its labours, we shall now return to the Third Army, which we
last saw on September 18 and following days, when it made good its way through
the outposts of the enemy, and closed with the Hindenburg Line. We shall begin
with the Fifth Corps on the right of the line, which was acting in close
liaison with the Third Corps on the left of the Fourth Army.</p>
<p>On September 27 there was no particular action on the front of the Fifth
Corps, save that the Twenty-first Division, that hard-bitten old scrapper, had
a prolonged fight in front of African Trench, which it alternately took and
lost, until on September 28 it got its iron claws fairly fastened in it. On
this day it also pushed patrols to the east of Gouzeaucourt.</p>
<p>On September 29, the day of general battle along the line, the Thirty-third
Division (Pinney) and the Twenty-first (Campbell) attacked at half-past three
in the morning, advancing upon the Hindenburg Line on the front
Honnecourt&mdash;Bantouzelle, while the Welsh Division operated to the north of
that point. There was some progress at first and Villers-Guislain was occupied,
but the enemy was strong and aggressive, so that the advance was first held and
then forced back to its starting-point. It was not a successful day, and there
seemed no choice but to settle down and subject these powerful lines to a
renewed bombardment. On the morning of September 30 it was found, however, that
the enemy had withdrawn his immediate front on account of the success in the
south, and the Corps was able to push forward to the western bank of the Canal
de l'Escaut. The Germans were still standing on guard on the eastern side. All
bridges were destroyed, and for three days General Shute prepared for the
difficult task of forcing this broad waterway&mdash;a formidable obstacle, it
is true, but not one which was likely to stop the men who had carried the line
of the Ancre. We shall now pass to the Fourth Corps on the left and bring them
to the same point.</p>
<p>On September 27 Harper's Fourth Corps had been given the task to capture
Beauchamp Ridge and Highland Ridge, and clear the front system of the
Hindenburg Line as far as the Couillet valley. The assault was launched at 5.20
in the morning. The Fifth Division on the right was from the outset sadly
hampered by the fire from African Trench, which struck upon its flank and
inflicted heavy losses. The division showed its usual gallantry, but the
position was an impossible one until the Fifth Corps got farther forward. The
left of the division, however, and the Forty-second Division made good
progress, though the fighting was very severe about Beauchamp, which was taken
but could not be held, as a fresh German division, advancing about 7 o'clock in
the evening, drove the defenders back to the west of it. The success of the
Sixth Corps in the north, however, at Flesqui&egrave;res, had an encouraging
effect upon the whole line, and about 2.30 P.M. of September 28 both the Fifth
and Forty-second Divisions came on once more, the latter being particularly
successful in getting prisoners and guns. The Fifth Division got Beauchamp and
Highland Ridge, but was still held up on the right. By evening the line was
well forward on the western slopes of Welsh Ridge, and some 1700 prisoners had
come in. It was clear that the German line was sagging, so in order to press
the advantage General Harper ordered up Russell's New Zealanders to carry the
battle on through the night. There could be no more stringent test of the
quality and discipline of troops, for the advance had to be made over unknown
country covered with trenches and wire entanglements, with only a fitful,
sinking moon to guide them. At 3 A.M. of a dark, cold night the splendid
Colonials passed through the ranks of the Forty-second Division and, driving
forward, thrust the enemy off Welsh Ridge and Bonavis Ridge beyond it, captured
1600 prisoners, and made good the line of the Canal de l'Escaut. North and
South Island brigades kept line in the advance. More than thirty guns were
among the trophies of this magnificent achievement. The Fifth Division on their
right swept forward at the same time near La Vacquerie, but as Gonnelieu upon
their flank had not yet been captured by the Fifth Corps, their attack was
limited on that side. This was remedied shortly after dawn, when the Fifth
Division, weary as it was, cleared their own right flank, captured Gonnelieu,
and finally took Banteux with 250 prisoners. The indefatigable New Zealanders
had also gone forward after dawn as blithely as though it was their first
attack, clearing the whole of the west bank of the Canal, and penetrating at
one time into Crevecoeur, where, however, they were unable to remain. They did
great work here, however, by holding and partly saving the bridge, all others
having been destroyed, and establishing some sort of bridgehead.</p>
<p>The total result of these attacks since September 27 on the front of the
Fourth Corps had been the capture of the whole front system of the Hindenburg
Line from Havrincourt Wood to the Canal, and the capture of 40 guns with 4000
prisoners. Beyond the Canal, however, lay formidable dangers. Only the
Crevecoeur bridge remained British. Beyond was a strongly-wired line of
trenches known as the Beaurevoir&mdash;Masni&eacute;res line, which ran roughly
southwards from Crevecoeur. On October 1 the New Zealanders had got a footing,
however, in Crevecoeur, and had begun to push troops over the bridge, but it
was desperate work, and the attacking brigade suffered heavy losses. It was,
however, work of the first importance, as it turned the whole of the Beaurevoir
line. There we may leave them, level with the Fifth Corps on their right, while
we turn to follow the progress of the Sixth Corps to the north, which completes
our survey of the Third Army.</p>
<p>The old Third Division&mdash;the "Iron" Division, as its admirers had begun
to call it&mdash;attacked on the right, and the Guards on the left. Deverell's
men went forward in splendid form, the 8th and 9th Brigades overrunning the
first objectives, and the 76th passing through them to the further positions.
They captured Flesqui&egrave;res, the village which had held us up in the
Cambrai battle, and by the afternoon they were east of Ribecourt, with 1000
prisoners trailing back to the rear. The Guards meanwhile, with the 2nd Brigade
in front, had some very tough work at the onset, but fought their way forward,
and were succeeded by the 1st Brigade who had reached by the afternoon the old
British front line. Continuing from here they captured Orival Wood, and reached
Premy Chapel, though this farthest point could not be maintained, as the party
which had won it had lost touch with the main body. The whole advance
represented a notable gain of ground. The losses were heavy, and were partly
due to the fact that the flank of the Guards passed Graincourt before the
Fifty-seventh Division in the Seventeenth Corps had captured that place, so
that they were exposed to heavy fire. Even the Guards have seldom been in a
hotter corner or shown more conspicuous examples of personal courage than
during this long and trying day, which brought three Victoria Crosses to the
battalions engaged. Lord Gort, who commanded the 1st Grenadiers, the leading
unit of the 3rd Brigade, was wounded as the troops formed up, but took no
notice of his injury, led on in the advance upon the Canal, was wounded again,
lay for a time half unconscious upon a stretcher, struggled once more to his
feet, and continued to lead his victorious Guardsmen through a hellish fire
with the final result of large captures of the men and guns who were opposing
them. The crossing of the Canal was signalised also by a remarkable exploit by
Captain Frisby and Corporal Jackson, who, with two other Coldstream Guardsmen,
climbed down one side and up the other of the dry Canal in order to capture a
machine-gun with a crew of nine who were lying amid the broken end of a bridge
on the farther bank. Jackson unhappily did not survive to receive the Cross
which he had won.</p>
<p>In the meantime the Sixty-second Division, now under General Whigham, passed
through the Third Division, and continued their victorious career. Two
companies of the 8th West Yorkshires got forward as far as the north-west
outskirts of Marcoing and Nine Wood, but were exposed to a raking fire from the
high ground on the south side of the Ribecourt valley, so had finally to fall
back. That night the Sixty-second continued to hold its advanced line while the
Second Division took the place of the Guards, and all was ready for the further
advance next morning.</p>
<p>On September 28 the Sixty-second dashed forward as soon as it was light, and
were soon in possession of Marcoing. There was no severe resistance. The Second
Division on the left kept well in line with the Yorkshiremen, and were soon the
masters of Nine Wood. By 10 o'clock the steady flow of the British infantry had
enveloped Marcoing Copse, and the 186th Brigade had reached the Canal, where
several bridges were found to be still intact. Noyelles had fallen to the
Second Division, who were now fighting over the ground which they had held in
the old Bourlon days, only nine months ago in time, and yet seeming so far o$
on account of the great succession of events which had elapsed. Some attempts
were made to get across the Canal, but the Germans were there in strength, and
nothing could be done without deliberate preparation. In the evening the
Sixty-second extended its boundaries, and consolidated what it held. A small
party of the Second Division got across the Canal during the night, but were
unable to establish any permanent bridge-head. In the morning of September 29,
however, one brigade of this division made a lodgment upon the farther side,
and remained there, though with wire and machine-guns before them. Pontoons
were brought up during the day and many bridges thrown across. The Sixty-second
meanwhile had cleared Les Rues Vertes and Masni&egrave;res and was well to the
east of those villages.</p>
<p>No progress was made on September 30, and the day was mainly spent in
strenuous preparations by General Harper for his renewed advance. The
Sixty-second Division cleared some more ground, and the Second Division failed
in a village attack, but neither movement was important. During the evening the
Third Division was brought forward on the right and took the place of the
Sixty-second, so that they might advance next morning in conjunction with the
New Zealanders on their right. This was duly carried out, the 5th Brigade
leading on the left, and the 76th on the right. It was a day of heavy fighting
and of stout resistance. The immediate object was the capture of Rumilly, which
was entered, but could not be entirely cleared by the 76th Brigade. The 5th
Brigade found Mont sur l'Oeuvre, which faced them, a particularly tough
proposition, and could make no headway. Altogether the losses on this day were
greater than the gains, but the troops were undismayed and eager to get forward
again on the morrow.</p>
<p>In the morning of October 1 they came back to their work, the 5th Brigade
still carrying on, while the 8th Brigade took the place of the 76th. By 10
o'clock Rumilly had fallen, which gave the British a most important point as
regards the passages over the river and canal. It took a great deal of
clearing, for it was honeycombed with cellars and dugouts, and there were
continual outflames of unexpected fire. Before evening it was solidly British.
No action of importance took place during the next few days, and the 4th of
October found the Sixth Corps in the same position as the rest of Byng's Army,
solidly established upon the western bank of the Escaut Canal and River, and
with some bridge-heads on the farther side.</p>
<p>On September 27 Fergusson's Seventeenth Corps, which had done such splendid
work in breaking a section of the main Hindenburg Line on September 2, was
called into vigorous action once more. Its r&ocirc;le was to advance in the
general attack which was made on that date by the First and Third Armies in
order to drive the enemy over the Canal de l'Escaut. The Fifty-second Lowland
Scottish Territorial Division was on the right of the Seventeenth Corps, and
the Sixty-third Naval Division on the left, while the Fifty-seventh Lancashire
Territorials had been assigned the duty of following up the initial advance,
and passing through the Sixty-third Division to reach the final objective. On
the immediate right of the Corps were the Guards Division of the Sixth Corps,
while on the left were the Fourth Canadians. The first line of objectives was
the Hindenburg support line, the second included the villages of Anneux and
Graincourt, while the third, if it could indeed be attained, would include
Fontaine, Cantaing, and the west edge of La Folie Wood.</p>
<p>A very desperate day of fighting lay ahead of the Seventeenth Corps before
this ambitious programme could be carried through, and yet the fire and ardour
of the troops carried them eventually to the farthest limit. The 156th Brigade
crossed the Canal du Nord on the right of the Sixty-third Division, in spite of
clouds of gas and very heavy shelling upon their places of assembly. The 4th
Royal Scots led the advance, and were soon in the first objective. Here they
were heavily attacked, however, and there was no further forward movement until
the 7th Scottish Rifles came up to thicken the line. Meanwhile the 157th
Brigade was dealing with that portion of the Hindenburg Line which was west of
the Canal, their operations being on the extreme right flank of the Corps in
close liaison with the Guards. This heavy work fell upon the 6th Highland Light
Infantry aided by three tanks, and they got well forward, but the 7th Highland
Light Infantry on their left were badly held up by thick wire and impossible
conditions. The 7th Scottish Rifles in the north had more success, however, and
they now worked south, which gave invaluable help to their comrades in that
quarter. Before midday all the ground east of the Canal attacked by the 156th
Brigade, between the Moeuvres&mdash;Graincourt Road and the
Bapaume&mdash;Cambrai Road, was in the possession of the Scottish infantry.</p>
<p>On the left of the Fifty-second Division the Sixty-third had got off in
excellent style, with the 190th Brigade leading, and the 188th immediately
behind it. They were encouraged by constant good news from the north, where the
Fourth Canadians were in Bourlon Wood. In front of the Sixty-third Division lay
an important point called the Factory, an old bone of contention in the days of
the Cambrai battle of 1917. This point was reached by the Anson Battalion, but
they were driven out of it again, and the Germans put in a heavy garrison. It
was then methodically bombarded, and shortly after 4 o'clock it was again
attacked by the 188th Brigade with complete success, 11 guns and many prisoners
being taken. Shortly afterwards both Graincourt and Anneux were overrun by the
advancing waves of the Sixty-third Division. About 5 o'clock the Fifty-seventh
Division was ordered up to take the place of the Sixty-third, moving round
their north flank with the intention of attacking Cantaing. The German
resistance had very much stiffened, however, and there was a menace of
counter-attack, so that this final movement did not fully develop. The night
fell with the 171st and 172nd Brigades in the advanced line which represented
the farthest east of the Sixty-third Division. A thousand prisoners were taken
during the day. Of the eleven tanks employed no less than nine were knocked out
by the German fire&mdash;a proportion which shows how great the risks are which
are taken by the brave men who form the crews. Each had done splendid work
before it met its fate, and ever more and more the infantry learned, when at
the last extremity before impassable wire and death-dealing trenches, to look
behind them in the hope of catching sight of one of these lumbering ironclad
monsters who had so often been their salvation.</p>
<p>On the morning of September 28 the two brigades of the Fifty-seventh
Division were ordered to continue their advance and to force the passage of the
Canal de l'Escaut, while the Sixty-third were to follow up and exploit any
success which was gained. The immediate task of the 171st Brigade was to clear
the ground between Anneux and Fontaine, and to establish touch with the
Canadians on their left. This they had done while the day was still young. From
about midday, however, the attack slowed up in this section of the line. The
Marcoing position was very strong, and it held the 171st Brigade. By 2 o'clock
a small force from the Fifty-seventh Division had got across the Canal, and at
about the same hour the Drake Battalion of the 189th Brigade advanced upon
Cantaing. The orders were to push on and cross the Canal, thrusting forward as
far as was possible, while the cavalry were held in leash at the south end of
La Folie Wood. It was soon clear, however, that the line of the canal and river
could not be easily rushed, for all the possible crossings were swept by a
deadly fire. The 171st Brigade was held under fire upon the spur east of
Fontaine, and the Canadians on the left had not yet made good the Marcoing
line. Two battalions of the 189th Brigade, the Drake and Hood, were in Folie
Wood, endeavouring to force a crossing, but the night fell before it could be
accomplished. Before morning two companies of Drakes had established posts upon
the farther side, others getting across the river as well, over a broken
bridge. Farther to the right the Sixth Corps had three companies of the Second
Division also across the Canal. A thousand more prisoners had been taken during
the day.</p>
<p>On September 29 all three brigades of the Sixty-third Division were across
the Canal. Before midday the Fifty-seventh Division had managed to clear the
Marcoing line from the Bapaume&mdash;Cambrai Road to the Canal. The men were
getting terribly worn, but it was reckoned that the Germans were even more so
and that, at all costs, the long-drawn fight should continue. Therefore on
September 30 both the Fifty-seventh and Sixty-third Divisions made some advance
east of the Canal de l'Escaut. On October 1 the Fifty-seventh Division pushed
out to the north and north-east of Proville, but the advance was not
successful. Later in the day there was a renewed advance, but again it was not
pushed, and did not get very far. The nearest enemy post, the Faubourg de
Paris, was strongly held, and there were several small counter-attacks, one of
which overwhelmed a British trench containing 40 men and 2 machine-guns. There
followed a considerable pause while fresh dispositions and reorganisations were
made along the whole line of the Army. These changes included very radical
alterations in the Seventeenth Corps, which lost the Fifty-second Division,
while it was strengthened by the addition of the Nineteenth (Jeffreys), the
Twenty-fourth (Daly), and the Sixty-first (Duncan). With this strong
reinforcement General Fergusson turned with confidence to his next task.</p>
<p>We shall now return to the operations of the rest of Byng's Third Army from
the time that they fairly settled down to the crossing of the Escaut Canal, and
the final occupation of the whole of the Hindenburg Line. We shall begin as
before with Shute's Fifth Corps on the right. The attack of this Corps on
October 4 was largely dependent upon the success of the Second American Corps,
and as this was only partial some modifications had to be made. The immediate
result of the American operations was that Morland's Thirteenth Corps, which
was on their left and on the right of the Fifth Corps, had to undertake an
advance against Le Catelet and Gouy on October 3. During this movement the
Fiftieth Division on the left of Morland's Corps was to take possession of the
high ground 1500 yards north of Le Catelet, and were then to be relieved by the
Welsh Division of the Fifth Corps. This was duly carried out by the evening of
October 4. The r&ocirc;le of the Welsh Division was afterwards to attack
northwards across the front of the Fifth Corps so as to clear the Hindenburg
Line as far north as Rancourt Farm. It was found, however, on October 5 that as
a result of the operations of the Fourth Army the enemy had withdrawn and
crossings were effected by the Twenty-first and Thirty-third Divisions along
the whole Corps front, while the Welshmen east of Vandhuile found that the line
to the north of them had been abandoned. They pushed on, therefore, and took
possession of the Nauroy&mdash;Le Catelet line, finishing up to the east of the
village of Aubencheul, while the 64th Brigade of the Twenty-first Division
moved forward and occupied the same line on their left. So far all had gone
splendidly, but it was soon found that the enemy's retreat was not unlimited,
for the Masni&egrave;res&mdash;Beaurevoir line was strongly held, and the Welsh
Division on October 6 was unable to penetrate it, though the Twenty-first
gained a limited footing at one point, which gave good hopes for the future.
After a day of reorganisation the attack was vigorously resumed on October 8,
the objectives being Malincourt on the right and Walincourt on the left. The
troops were now in green and virgin country unscarred by any previous battles,
and a most pleasant contrast to that terrible wilderness in which they had
marched and fought so long. The attack of October 8 was made by night, the zero
hour being 1 o'clock in the morning. All three brigades of the Welsh Division
were concerned in the advance on the right, and all had heavy fighting and some
setbacks, but persevered with fine valour, and succeeded before evening in
piercing the Beaurevoir line, driving in the strong German rearguards and
establishing their final position to the east of Malincourt. The Twenty-first
Division on the left also came away with great dash and made rapid progress in
their moonlight advance. By dawn most of the high ground in front of them,
including Angles Ch&acirc;teau and Hurtebise Farm, had been taken and the 62nd
Reserve Brigade moved forward to continue the operation, which resulted in the
capture of the whole Beaurevoir line on that front. Before evening, after
several temporary checks, the Twenty-first Division had reached a line 500
yards west of Walincourt, though the left of their advance had not passed the
Sargrenon River. Nearly 1000 Germans were taken during this long day of battle.
That night the Seventeenth Division took over from the Twenty-first, while the
Thirty-third moved through the ranks of the Thirty-eighth, so as to be all
ready for a continuation of the pressure in the morning.</p>
<p>On this October 8, when the enemy was reported to be withdrawing from the
front of the Fifth and Fourth Corps, and it was probable that the movement
would spread across the face of the Sixth and Seventeenth Corps, it was very
necessary, if possible, to catch them in the very act. An attack was therefore
ordered in which the Third Division to the south should move, supported by the
Guards, upon Wambaix, while the Seventeenth Corps should take Niergnies as its
general objective. The Sixty-third Division made the actual attack on a front
of about a mile, with seven tanks in the van. The 188th Brigade on the right
had Niergnies in front of it, approaching it from the north-east, while one
battalion of the 189th Brigade attacked from the south, the rest forming a
protective flank. The Fifty-seventh Division was at the same time to make a
subsidiary attack. The advance started at 4.30, but by 6.30 the Fifty-seventh
Division had made little progress, its tank being ditched and its 170th Brigade
held up by an obstinate trench. By 8 o'clock the line had got forward, and all
the first objectives were gained, but the Germans were still firing from the
edge of the Faubourg de Paris. A little later a very spirited counter-attack
was launched by the enemy from the direction of Awoingt, which was supported by
seven British-made tanks, captured in the March operations. For a time the
188th Brigade and the Second Division on the right were thrown back, but by 10
o'clock they were going forward once again, and at that hour, or shortly
afterwards, a very welcome pigeon message arrived from the Hoods of the 189th
Brigade to say that they were through Niergnies. By the late afternoon every
objective had been captured, but the evening saw another strong German advance
which struck upon the right of the Seventeenth Corps and upon the front of the
Second Division. The Naval men stood fast, however, and not only cleared their
own front, but by their enfilade fire were of great assistance to their
neighbours in the south. Nearly a thousand prisoners had been captured during
the day, and the little flags had moved eastwards once more upon the war
maps.</p>
<p>On October 9 the troops were going forward shortly after dawn. It was soon
found that the Germans had retreated, leaving only a few devoted machine-guns
to impede the pursuit. Gard Wood and Clary were occupied by the Thirty-third
Division, who came on so rapidly that they picked up a battery of field-guns
near the village and captured the officers drinking in an estaminet, quite
unconscious that their enemy was upon them. Bertry was occupied by the 19th
Brigade, and before evening Troisvilles had also been captured. On the left
without any opposition at all, the 51st Brigade of the Seventeenth Division
passed through Malincourt, Selvigny, and Caullery. The German machine-guns made
some show at Montigny, but the place was soon occupied, as was Tronquoy. There
was no barrage this day in front of the Fifth Corps, and the advance was one
long cross-country chase of six or seven miles, with an occasional skirmish.
Early on the morning of October 10, the Thirty-third Division crossed the
Inchy&mdash;Le Cateau Road, and with the mention of the latter name that huge
circle seemed at last to be nearing completion, the line of which had begun to
describe its strange curve in August 1914. The soldiers knew that the graves of
their comrades were at last within their reach. The Seventeenth Division on
this day flowed through Audencourt and Inchy, and the 7th East Yorkshires
actually got up to Neuvilly in a fine attack, but had to be withdrawn. The
Selle River in its shallow valley lay right across the Corps front, and this,
as was clear from the increasing artillery fire, marked the new German front.
Here we may leave the Fifth Corps while we hark back to bring up their comrades
of the Third Army. On the evening of October 11, the situation was that the
Thirty-third Division on the right had established one strong post upon the
farther river bank, the Seventeenth on the left were lining the western bank of
the Selle, while the enemy were reported to be holding the line of the Le
Cateau&mdash;Solesmes railway in strength, and especially the village of
Neuvilly to the east of the river.</p>
<p>Turning now to Harper's Fourth Corps on the left, and harking back to
October 5, it became evident on that morning that the enemy was withdrawing
from that point, as a result of the success of Rawlinson's Army to the south,
and even more so to the possession of Crevecoeur by Russell's New Zealanders.
The retreat was closely followed by the Thirty-seventh and the New Zealand
Divisions, and Vaucelles, with a portion of the Masni&egrave;res line south of
Crevecoeur, was occupied without resistance. The Masni&egrave;res line was
still strongly held, though the glow of great fires in the east at night seemed
to proclaim a coming retreat. October 6 and 7 were spent in preparing for a
great attack upon the 8th, in which it was hoped that the Masni&egrave;res line
would be forced. This assault made by the Thirty-seventh and New Zealanders was
completely successful, in spite of belts of wire which were often thirty yards
wide and had to be crossed in the dim light of dawn. There was hard fighting
round Briseaux Wood, but everywhere the attack prevailed and the Germans were
beaten out of their positions. Lesdin fell to the New Zealanders and Rifle
Brigade. Once the enemy tanks advanced, and there was a short check, but the
forward movement was soon resumed. Over 2100 prisoners were taken in this
successful day.</p>
<p>On the 9th and 10th the advance was as swift and successful as in the case
of the Fifth Corps already described. The Thirty-seventh occupied Caudry,
Bethencourt, and Viesly, while the New Zealanders, men of Otago and Canterbury,
took Esnes, and finally crossed the Cambrai&mdash;Le Cateau Road. Up to now
this district of France might have been a land without inhabitants, a mere
stage for the drama of war; but now considerable numbers of the French
civilians were liberated, no less than 2500 at Caudry, all with the same tales
of German bullying and violence. In the early morning, the Thirty-seventh and
their comrades of New Zealand were opposite the Selle River and had passed some
elements across on each side of Biastre. We may leave them here on the eve of
the battle of the Selle River and extend our view so as to take in the work of
the Sixth Corps to the north of them.</p>
<p>In the case of Haldane's Sixth Corps there was a general German withdrawal
on October 5, which did not prevent a very firm front being shown upon the
general line which was held on October 8. The attack upon that day was made by
the 9th Brigade of the Third Division on the right, and by the 99th Brigade of
the Second Division on the left. The village of Seranvillers was the immediate
objective of the 9th Brigade, which was strengthened by the 2nd Suffolk
Battalion. Both the 9th and 99th Brigades got well forward at the start, but
had very hard fighting, and at one time were driven back by a German
counter-attack supported by tanks. The village had been taken, but the cellars
were still full of Germans. La Targatte, the other village on the front,
repulsed two attacks and was vigorously defended, the 2nd Suffolk having heavy
losses in front of it. Later in the day, however, it was taken by a fine
advance of the 8th Royal Lancasters and the 1st Gordons of the 76th Brigade. On
the left flank both the 99th Brigade and the Sixty-third Division upon their
left had encountered strong opposition from the village of Forenville and had
suffered from the counter-attack already mentioned, but three of the German
tanks were destroyed, and the advance was resumed with the result that before
evening Forenville had been taken, and the whole line of the original objective
secured. It was only attained, however, after a day of very desperate battle
and heavy losses. During the evening the Guards came up, with their 1st and 2nd
Brigades in the line, and early in the morning, supported by the fire of nine
brigades of field artillery, they reached the line of railway along the whole
Corps front, and took the village of Wambaix. News from the north now showed
that the enemy was retreating upon a broad front and in no half-hearted manner.
Patrols of the Seventeenth Corps were reported to have passed through Cambrai,
while north of that the troops of the First Army had crossed the canal at
Ramillies with little opposition. Previous experience had shown that such a
retreat would certainly be conducted in an orderly fashion, and would be
covered by rearguards composed mainly of machine-gun units. The main thing,
however, was to sustain the pressure and keep as close to the retiring masses
as possible. Led by that veteran body, the Oxfordshire Hussars, acting as
advanced scouts, the infantry of the Sixth Corps hurried forward in pursuit
with much the same general experience as the two Corps on their right.
Estourmel, Igniel, and Boistrancourt marked the main line of the advance, and
were occupied by the Guards, who were in touch with the New Zealanders of the
Fourth Corps on their right and with the Twenty-fourth Division of the
Seventeenth Corps on their left. On October 10 the Guards were through St.
Hilaire, and up to St. Vaast, which latter village was cleared after a stiff
local skirmish on October 11. The Germans still seemed inclined to fight in
this quarter to the west of the Selle River, especially at St. Aubert and
Solesmes. They were brushed aside, however, and on October 13 the Guards gained
that portion of St. Python which is west of the Selle, a stream about thirty
feet across and of some depth. It was evident that an organised full-scale
attack would have to be made at this point, so the Sixth Corps waited for the
general signal.</p>
<p>Returning to the Seventeenth Corps: On the morning of October 9 the attack
was renewed by Daly's Twenty-fourth Division, a unit which has always been in
the heart of the fighting in the past, and now was in the line once more. It
was a great day, for early in the morning, as is recorded elsewhere, the
Canadians and the Fifty-seventh Division had entered Cambrai. The situation
seemed fluid, and the enemy disorganised, so the 6th Dragoon Guards were
ordered forward to work towards Cagnoncles, while the 72nd Brigade, having
taken Awoingt, gave way to the 73rd Brigade, who advanced towards Cauroir and
west of Romilly. The Germans, however, were in a strong line of rifle-pits
behind triple wire, so that the cavalry could gain no ground. The infantry were
also unable to get forward very far on that day, but evening saw them in close
touch with the German covering rearguards, the Twenty-fourth Division touching
the Guards on the right, the Canadians on the left. In the morning of October
10 the screen had dissolved and the leading lines of the Seventeenth Corps,
consisting of the 17th Brigade, were soon to the east of Cagnoncles, which fell
to the 7th Northamptons, while the Dragoon Guards were pushing ahead once more.
Rieux and Avesnes were both taken by the Twenty-fourth Division during the day,
and before evening the line was well to the east of Cambrai, General Daly
pushing the advance with great vigour.</p>
<p>On October 11 it was found that the Germans were in strength and apparently
meant to make a serious stand. At about ten o'clock they counter-attacked with
tanks, and pushed back both the Canadians on the left and the Twenty-fourth
Division on the right. The former had taken Iwuy in the morning. No further
advance was made during the day, but general orders were issued that the way
should be cleared up to the Selle River, and that the high ground over the
river should be secured in order to safeguard the crossings. On October 12 the
Canadian Corps on the left was drawn out of the line, and the Seventeenth Corps
found themselves with the Forty-eighth Division of the Twenty-second Corps as
their northern neighbours. On this day the Germans again began to retreat, and
the Corps front was advanced down to the Selle River, between Haussy and
Saulzoir. There was hardly any opposition. All day the Twenty-fourth Division
was advancing with the Forty-ninth on their left and the Guards on their right.
That evening the 17th Brigade of the Twenty-fourth Division made progress over
the river, entering Montrecourt and securing the undamaged bridge. The posts on
the farther side were swept by machine-gun fire and driven back next morning,
that portion of the bank being commanded by rising ground on the east.</p>
<p>We have thus traced all four Corps of the Third Army from the date August
21, when it started from the line of Albert, until October 13, when it found
itself after seven weeks of immense and continuous exertion and of
uninterrupted victory upon the western bank of the Selle. In the compressed
narrative of this chronicle it might seem no more complex than the forward
movement of pieces upon a board, but no detailed account could ever make real
the problems, the anxiety, the organisation, the unwearied heroic efforts which
such an advance must entail when the great German army, now composed of
veterans deeply skilled in every wile of modern warfare, were beaten out of
position after position, and could find no safe refuge anywhere from the nation
whose military weakness had for so long been its standing jest.</p>

<h2><a id="chap9" name="chap9">IX. OPERATIONS OF BYNG'S THIRD ARMY</a><br>
From the Battle of the Selle, October 12, to the end</h2>
<p class="chaphead">The battle of the Selle River&mdash;Reversion to open
warfare&mdash;The valour of Lancashire&mdash;Haig's incessant
blows&mdash;Weakening of the German morale&mdash;The battle of Mormal
Forest&mdash;New Zealanders and the mediaeval fortress&mdash;Capture of the
great forest&mdash;The Sambre bridged&mdash;A grand Division&mdash;Advance of
Fergusson's Seventeenth Corps&mdash;The last phase.</p>
<p class="first">THE River Selle is a small stream, only thirty feet across but
of some depth, and it ran right athwart the course of the Army, with every
indication that the enemy had built up a line of resistance behind it. How far
this was a strong rearguard or how far it was a do-or-die line of battle could
only be determined by actual assault. The river runs through swampy meadows
from Neuvilly past Biastre to Solesmes. On the far bank the ground slopes up
uniformly to a hog-backed ridge, with a road and railway running between
Neuvilly and Solesmes, rather more than half-way up the slope. The railway
joined other lines south of the latter town, forming a triangular embankment of
great strength strongly defended by machine-guns, as was the whole railway line
and the string of villages across the Army front, which was the northern
prolongation of that described previously. It was a position of great natural
strength, made more awkward by the presence of civilians in the villages, and
by a damming of the river which broadened it in parts into a lake. The first
move of General Byng was to endeavour to seize the high ground on the east of
the river, so as to make a strong point which would cover the bridge-building
operations. We shall describe the successive operations from the south or
right, beginning with Shute's Fifth Corps, still working in close liaison with
Morland's Thirteenth Corps on the right, the flank unit of the Fourth Army. It
may be premised that the warfare from now onwards was very different from that
which had preceded the capture of the great German lines. The trench, the bomb,
and the wire all played subsidiary parts. An officer of pre-war Aldershot
experience, or even the great Duke himself with his Peninsular prejudices,
would have found himself able to appreciate the situation. That great shade,
could he have ridden Copenhagen in the heart of this wonderful army, would have
seen, as of yore, shells which burst over the enemy's position; he would have
seen cavalry scouts who were the advanced posts of the marching army; he would
have seen lines of skirmishers behind them; he would have seen mounted officers
who carried personal reports; and he would have seen columns of route marching
in fours down every road, and breaking up into small clumps of artillery
formation as they came under fire. All this would have been familiar, and all
this he would have seen had he been present in these later phases of the great
war.</p>
<p>The attack was launched at 5 A.M. on October 12, when the advanced guard of
the Thirty-third and Seventeenth Divisions, under Generals Pinney and
Robertson, advanced upon the high ground which faced them. They were working in
close liaison with the Thirty-seventh on the left, and with the Sixty-sixth
Lancashire Territorials on the right, these being the flank units of the Fourth
and Thirteenth Corps respectively. The line of the advance was to the north of
Montay, and it went very well at first, so that by 7.45 Pinney's men were far
forward and consolidating on the left, though on the right they were unable to
penetrate beyond the railway line. The attack of the Seventeenth on the left
reached the high ground 1000 yards north-east of Neuvilly, but on the south
side of that village could not get past the line of the Montay&mdash;Neuvilly
Road, where the 9th West Ridings of the 52nd Brigade were heavily engaged.
Neuvilly was gained, but while the troops were mopping it up a strong German
counter-attack drove down from the Amerval direction, dashed up against the
left of Pinney's Division and threw it back to the line of the railway. So
great was the pressure and so continuous, that the Thirty-third could not hold
any of its gains, and found itself in the afternoon on the west of the Selle
River once more, save for the right-hand battalion, who held tight all day
along the line of the road between the railway and the river.</p>
<p>The Seventeenth Division on the high ground north-east of Neuvilly was now
in a very dangerous position, as the Thirty-seventh had not come up on its
left, so that both its flanks were in the air. The 12th Manchesters stood firm,
however, with little support, until about 3 P.M., when a creeping barrage with
an infantry attack behind it drove them west of the railway, with serious
losses, to a point 200 yards east of the river. The result was that the final
line, when night fell upon this long and trying day, was across the river at
both extreme flanks, but west of the river in the middle.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the Fourth Corps on the left the 12th had not been
a very satisfactory day either. The Thirty-seventh had reached the crest of the
opposite hill, but the New Zealanders on their left had not taken Bellevue,
while Neuvilly on the right had never been thoroughly cleared. About 5 P.M. the
German counter-attack, made in four waves, came down upon the Thirty-seventh,
supported by flank fire from both villages. It reached Neuvilly in the
Seventeenth Division sector, and then turned right so as to enfilade the
Thirty-seventh, with the result that the latter were forced to evacuate both
the hill and the railway line, but still held on to the east bank of the river,
where a steep escarpment gave some protection. Thus ended this weary day, which
had not involved the Sixth Corps on the north, but had exposed both the
southern Corps of the Third Army to heavy losses with barren results.</p>
<p>A week now elapsed, which was marked by very heavy artillery work on both
sides, the Germans endeavouring to prevent the British from assembling, while
the British tried to break down the machine-gun nests and strong points which
faced them, especially in Neuvilly. There were several daring minor engagements
in which patrols endeavoured to widen or strengthen the front, so keen being
the contest that sometimes posts were taken and retaken several times in one
night. There was, it must be admitted, no obvious local sign of any failure in
German morale. It was not until October 20 that the offensive was resumed upon
a large scale by the Fifth and Fourth Corps, in conjunction with a full-dress
attack by the whole of the Fourth Army in the south.</p>
<p>The Fifth Corps advanced with Cubitt's Thirty-eighth Welsh on the right, and
the Seventeenth Division on the left. Neither line had far to go before
clashing with the enemy, for the outposts were almost touching each other. The
attack began in the dark at 2 in the morning, the British having indulged in
previous heavy shoots at night, in the hope, which was justified by the result,
that the real barrage would be taken as being of a similar temporary nature.
The Welshmen had a desperate experience at first, a quarry, a farm, and the old
railway embankment all forming difficult obstacles. In the case of the quarry,
every man of the original storming party became a casualty, but it was taken by
their successors. The rain was heavy, the slopes slippery, the mud deep, and
the whole of the conditions about as bad as they could be, which was the more
serious as the tanks were put out of action thereby.</p>
<p>The 50th Brigade of the Seventeenth Division, with the 7th East Yorks and
6th Dorsets in the lead, had been launched upon Neuvilly with instructions to
avoid a frontal attack, but to endeavour to get round to north and south so as
to pinch it out; while the guns bombarded it and kept the machine-gunners in
their lairs. South of the village the attack advanced rapidly through the mirk
of a most inclement night. The first lines of machine-guns were overrun and
destroyed. The wave of men then fought their way through some wire, and got as
far as the embankment, which was thickly garnished with light artillery. Before
dawn the 10th West Yorkshires closed in upon Neuvilly, and in spite of several
obstinate machine-guns cleared the place and took the survivors prisoners, most
of them being dragged out of cellars. Pushing on, the Seventeenth Division
after several vicissitudes captured the village of Amerval, but were pushed out
of it again by a counter-attack, finally regaining it after dark. The 7th
Borders took this village, but lost both their commander and their adjutant in
doing so. The Thirty-eighth had kept its line all through, so that by evening
the whole objective was practically in the hands of the British after a very
prolonged and stubborn fight, in the course of which the Corps had taken four
guns and 600 prisoners.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Harper's Fourth Corps on the left had also gone forward at 2 A.M.,
their objective being the high ground to the south of Solesmes. The plan was
that the Sixth Corps should take the ground to the north of the village, but
the whole operations were made very difficult by the knowledge that the
civilian inhabitants were still there, and that the guns had therefore to be
used sparingly. When once the points on both sides had been occupied it was
hoped that the Sixty-second Division of the Sixth Corps would be able to
capture the place. The advance of the Fourth Corps was made with the Fifth
Division on the right and the Forty-second on the left. The line of the railway
and the high ground east of it were successively occupied, though the fire was
heavy and the finest qualities were needed in the soldiers who breasted the
hill with lines of machine-guns flashing at them from the hawthorn hedges of
the embankment. In the attack upon the hamlet of Marou the 127th Brigade of the
Forty-second Division showed the usual Lancastrian gallantry. There are no
finer, tougher soldiers in the world, either in attack or defence, than these
North Countrymen. On one occasion on this day, a company of the 5th Manchesters
being pinned down, it was essential to convey news of their position to their
supports. Four volunteers started in succession across the open bullet-swept
plain, and all four were shot down. None the less Private Wilkinson volunteered
as the fifth and actually got through unscathed and saved the situation. For
this and other exertions during the day he received the Victoria Cross. The 1st
and 3rd Guards Brigade had gone forward on the front of the Sixth Corps, with
the 2nd Brigade in immediate support, and these magnificent troops, taking St.
Python in their stride, beat down all opposition and by 7.30 were in their
appointed place to the north of the village. The two flanks being thus secured,
the Sixty-second went in between them with their usual vigour and, according to
plan, assaulted the place from the west, fighting their way into it and out at
the other side, the 186th Brigade taking the village while the 185th passed
through it for a fresh advance. The 2/4 York and Lancaster aided in mopping up
the village, which entailed some very severe fighting from house to house, as
dangerous often as entering a cave in which lurks some wounded beast of prey.
It was on this occasion that Corporal Daykins won his Cross, leading the twelve
men, who were the only survivors of his platoon, with that mixture of wile and
courage which is the ideal combination. He not only cleared the front of his
own platoon, but perceiving that his neighbours were held up he started out
alone to their assistance, with such success that he brought back a machine-gun
and 25 more prisoners as the prize of his own unaided effort.</p>
<p>The 3rd Guards Brigade on the extreme left attempting to make good the
Solesmes&mdash;Valenciennes Road, were checked for a time by very heavy fire,
but overcame the difficulty, and soon the Guards had their full objective, and
were in touch with the Nineteenth Division on the flank of the Seventeenth
Corps on their left at Maison Blanche. The Forty-second Division on the right
had got well forward, but was checked at last on the line of the Beart brook,
which caused the Sixty-second on their left to throw out a defensive flank and
put limits to their advance. The Fifth Division on the extreme right had also
been held, and were finally driven off the high ground south of Marou by a
sharp counterstroke of the enemy. By evening the Fifth and Forty-second had
secured almost their full objectives, the Manchester battalions having borne
the brunt of the fighting. The Fourth Corps had taken over 1000 prisoners. The
Sixth Corps had also gone to its full limit, the Guards and Sixty-second having
cleared everything in front of them and sent back 700 prisoners. It had been a
most successful day; but the hardest work had fallen upon the Fourth Corps,
both divisions having been badly knocked about. It was determined to spend a
day therefore in consolidating the gains, and to continue the advance on
October 23.</p>
<p>On that date the Fifth Corps on the right went forward once again, with the
Thirty-third Division on the right and the Twenty-first on the left. If we
attempt to describe the action from the broad point of view of the whole Corps
front, the order of battle from the right was the Thirty-third, Twenty-first,
Fifth, Forty-second, Third, and Second. On the front of the Sixth Corps there
was a sudden outburst of artillery fire during the assembly of the troops,
which unhappily caught the Third Division and caused many casualties. It is a
hard test even for the most veteran troops to be under a hurricane of shells in
the dark and cold of an autumn night, but the men of the Iron Division came
into the battle as blithely as ever. The Harpies River, and a whole screen of
villages and of woods, with the great Forest of Mormal at their back, were the
immediate obstacles which confronted the Army. On the right the village of
Forest was soon secured, though an obstinate pocket held out for some time to
the north-east of it. The enemy in this quarter could be seen retiring in small
parties towards Vendegies and the wood near that village. The Thirty-third
Division on the flank had a greater volume of fire to contend with and was
rather slower than the Twenty-first, which never halted until it was close to
Vendegies, reaching it at 10 A.M. The defence was thickening, however, and both
divisions had very heavy going in the afternoon, though the 19th Brigade of the
Thirty-third Division fought its way along the north of Vendegies Wood, and
reached its allotted line, while the 98th Brigade was held up by the fire from
Bousies. As the farther line was reached the two reserve brigades of each
division&mdash;the 62nd and the 100th Brigades&mdash;were pushed up to take the
burden from those who were wearied out by the long and strenuous day. Nearly
800 prisoners had fallen to the Fifth Corps.</p>
<p>The Fourth Corps had the preliminary task of clearing the south side of the
St. Georges River, and taking the village of Beaurain. This was allotted to the
Fifth and Forty-second Divisions, but the leading brigade of the former was
caught in the artillery attack already alluded to, with the result that it
sustained losses which seriously crippled it. None the less the attack started
up to time and was successfully carried out, save that Beaurain could not be
cleared&mdash;a fact which necessitated a change in barrage, no easy matter
after a great action is launched. The 125th Lancashire Fusilier Brigade of the
Forty-second Division did particularly fine work. The Thirty-seventh Division
and the New Zealanders, Canterbury and Otago in the van, had now passed through
the ranks of their comrades, and as there were signs of German disorganisation
the pressure was strenuously maintained. As a result the New Zealanders
captured the crossings over the Ecaillon River before they could be destroyed,
and reached the edge of Le Quesnoy, while the Thirty-seventh seized Ghissignies
with its bridge. It was a great day's work for Harper's Corps.</p>
<p>On the left the Third and Second Divisions had advanced on single-brigade
fronts, the 76th and 5th being in the lead. The 1st Gordons of the 76th
advancing rapidly, cleared the village of Romeries after a very sharp tussle. A
battalion commander and 600 men were taken. The rest of the brigade then passed
through it and carried the line forward. It was evident this day that the
Germans, though hard in patches, were really becoming demoralised under the
pounding of the British, and that they had lost all stomach for the fray.
Several well-placed machine-guns were abandoned by their crews without a shot
being fired, and serious opposition seemed at places to be at an end. Both the
8th Royal Lancasters and the 2nd Suffolks went through every defence like
paper. The 8th Brigade then took up the running, and the 2nd Royal Scots
carried Vertain with 200 more prisoners, while the 1st Scots Fusiliers took
Escarmain also with 200 Germans. Patrols were sent forward as far as the
Ecaillon River and few of the enemy appeared to be left upon the southern
bank.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the 5th Brigade on the left had passed to the north of Vertain and
swept forward, keeping level with the Nineteenth Division on their left. They
co-operated in the capture of Escarmain, and the rest of the Second Division
made its way through Capelle, and lined the Capelle&mdash;St. Martin Road, the
latter village having been taken by the Nineteenth Division. So demoralised did
the Germans appear on this flank, with their gun-teams all out in the open
ready to limber up, that it appeared as if unlimited progress could be made by
Haldane's Corps, but it was known that the enemy were in a sterner mood to the
south and that the Fourth and Fifth Corps, though victorious, had no assurance
of an easy advance. It was determined therefore to renew the battle next
morning before daylight.</p>
<p>At that hour the Thirty-third and Twenty-first Divisions again went forward
on the right, but the opposition in this quarter was still very stiff. Poix du
Nord was captured by the Twenty-first and some 3000 inhabitants were found
cowering in the cellars. Englefontaine was at the same time attacked by the
100th Brigade of the Thirty-third Division, but the machine-guns were busy and
it was some time before they could get a lodgment. The Twenty-first was at the
same time held up on the road north of the village. About 4 P.M. the line moved
forward again behind a fresh barrage, that refreshing shower which revives the
exhausted infantry. The men of the 100th Brigade got halfway through
Englefontaine and remained there at close grips with their tenacious
adversaries, while the Twenty-first fought their way forward to the south-east
of Ghissignies, where they were again pulled up. The resistance on this
southern section of the Corps front was certainly very different from that
experienced by Haldane's Corps in the left flank. Meanwhile the Fourth and
Sixth Corps were waiting for the Fourth Army and the Fifth Corps to swing into
line, but they made a short forward movement on October 24, the Third Division
passing through Ruesnes, while the New Zealanders on their right kept pace with
them. Both the Fifth Corps on the right and the Seventeenth Corps on the left
were for the time rather behind the general line, so that a long defensive
flank had to be formed by each of the Corps between them. The Sixty-first
Division had come in on the right of the Seventeenth Corps, but it had at once
run into a sharp attack which drove it for the time out of
Vendegiessur-Ecaillon. During this day some attempt was made by the Sixth Corps
to push cavalry through, but every horse of two strong patrols of Oxfordshire
Hussars was shot, so that it was impossible to persevere.</p>
<p>The village of Englefontaine had not yet been cleared, so after a
breathing-space of one day the Thirty-third Division attacked once more, while
its neighbour to the south, the Eighteenth Division, co-operated by advancing
upon Mount Carmel. This attempt was entirely successful, the 100th Brigade
flooding over the village and capturing 450 prisoners. The Twenty-first
Division at the same time advanced its line on the north.</p>
<p>The Army had now outrun its communications and a halt was necessary. It was
Haig's policy, however, to continue raining down hammer blows upon his reeling
antagonist, so that all was ready for a big fresh advance on November 4, which
should be on an immense scale, involving the fronts of the Fourth, Third, and
First Armies.</p>
<p>The immediate objective in front of the right of the Third Army was the
formidable bulk of the Mormal Forest, after which the action may well be named.
The advance on the front of the Fifth Corps was made by the Thirty-eighth Welsh
on the right and the Seventeenth Division on the left, each brigade succeeding
the other, as the various objectives were reached. The edge of the Forest was
strongly held, but when once it had been penetrated the progress along the
sides was rapid and the enemy freely surrendered. So fair were the prospects
that the troops were ordered not to confine themselves to the allotted
objectives but to push on as far as they could. The ultimate aim was to gain a
passage over the Sambre, though this seemed to be more than one day's work
could possibly accomplish.</p>
<p>The Thirty-eighth Division attained its full objectives, but the Seventeenth
met with a lively resistance in Locquignol, and was held up for a time. The
weather had broken and the rain was falling, but in spite of the depressing
surroundings the fighting line pressed on. The 13th Welsh Regiment moving
forward with great dash pushed patrols into Sarbaras, where many rifles
scattered over the ground pointed to the German demoralisation. All night the
Welshmen pushed forward, and Berlaimont was taken in the early morning. At the
same hour the Seventeenth Division, having overcome their difficulties, were
nearly as far forward on their left. The Forest had been expected to form a
greater obstacle than was really the case, for when once it was entered it was
found that the clearings were so extensive that save in patches it was hardly
an obstacle at all.</p>
<p>The Fourth Corps had gone forward on November 4 with the Thirty-seventh
Division on the right and the New Zealanders on the left. The latter were to
advance upon either side of Le Quesnoy, which was to be encircled and taken.
The town, which was an old-fashioned walled fortress, was not shelled on
account of the inhabitants, but smoke- and oil-drums were fired on to the
ramparts.</p>
<p>The attack was a complete success and swept over every obstacle without a
check, save for some short delay caused by a strong point missed by the barrage
in front of the Thirty-seventh Division. Louvignies and Jolimetz were taken by
the Thirty-seventh, which pushed on to establish itself within the Forest. The
New Zealanders left Hart's Brigade to invest Le Quesnoy and also advanced
rapidly into the Forest, capturing many prisoners and guns. Le Quesnoy was now
completely isolated, but the ancient walls and gateways were strongly defended
by all modern devices, and a machine-gun clattered through the slit where a bow
may once have been bent. An officer with a flag of truce got no response. An
aeroplane was then sent over, which dropped the message that our troops were in
the Forest far to the east, and that a surrender would be the wisest course.
The enemy, however, would have none of it. A forlorn hope of New Zealanders
then approached with a scaling-ladder in the good old style, and swarmed up the
walls. There was only one ladder and three successive walls, but in some
miraculous fashion the whole of the 4th New Zealand Battalion reached the top
of the rampart, with the loss of one man. This was accomplished by sweeping the
walls round with such a fire that the defenders could not even peep over. On
seeing that they had reached the rampart the German commander at last hoisted
the white flag. The garrison consisted of about 1000 men.</p>
<p>The Sixth Corps advanced with the Sixty-second on the right and the Guards
on the left, each on a two-brigade front. Both divisions went forward from the
beginning without a hitch, prisoners streaming back. As they advanced, however,
they came into heavy machine-gun fire from the orchards southwest of Frasnoy
and south of Wargnies, where for a time the Guards were held up. The country
here was very enclosed and thickly hedged, which made progress slow. By
evening, however, the objectives had been reached, the orchards cleared, with
Frasnoy, Preux-au-Sart, and 1000 prisoners to show for their day's work.
Altogether this battle of Mormal Forest had been a day of triumph for the Third
Army, and especially for the Fourth Corps in the centre. It was a great
victory, in which on this front alone some 7000 prisoners and about 100 guns
were taken, while the Germans had been beaten, with great loss, out of a
position which, in their old form, they would have held for a month. So
complete was the German break-up that several batteries were taken by the
Fourth Corps, with horses, mounted officers, and all complete, and were then
despatched in full working order to the rear. When one recalls how their papers
and critics had clamoured for open warfare against the untrained British levies
the result must have surprised them. At the end of the fight the British line
was well up to the great forest.</p>
<p>In the evening the old Fifth Division, now at last reaching the end of those
labours which had lasted for more than four terrible years without a break,
came into the field once more. It would be interesting to know whether there
was a single man left in the ranks of those who had skirted Mormal Forest in
August 1914 among the eager battalions which now faced the same obstacle. It is
of course true that even the units had been largely altered in the interval,
and yet some of the grand old battalions still marched in their honoured
formations, changed in all save that eternal spirit which has made and kept
them famous. The Fifth Division was ordered to pass through the ranks of the
Thirty-seventh after dawn at the western edge of Mormal Forest, and to push
onwards to the east. General Oldman of the 15th Brigade on the left advanced on
a one-battalion front, and kept the 1st Bedfords, 1st Norfolks, and 1st
Cheshires leapfrogging through each other as often as possible in order to
minimise the difficulties of the Forest. General Norton of the 95th Brigade on
the right of the line attacked with the 1st East Surreys and 1st Cornwalls in
the van, and the 1st Devons in reserve. All day the Fifth Division clove its
way through the great forest, the British front, like a line of beaters,
putting up the game as it went. For the most part it was but a faint-hearted
quarry, but here and there it stood fiercely at bay, and trench mortars had to
be rushed up and strong points blown down, before the infantry could get
forward. The 3rd Hussars kept pace and connected up with the New Zealanders on
the left. Pelting rain, deep mud, and broken tracks delayed, but could not
stop, the ardent advance, which continued until the leading line was down on
the bank of the Sambre, where they were joined next day by the van of the
Forty-second Division, which had relieved the New Zealanders. One bridge at
Quartes was found intact and was ready for demolition, but Major Cloutman of
the Sappers, commanding the 59th Field Company, with extraordinary gallantry
rolled across the tow-path, swam the river, and cut the leads of the charge,
all under very heavy fire. It was a most daring deed, which was rewarded by a
V.C., but unhappily a small party of the enemy with equal gallantry succeeded
in repairing the leads and destroying the bridge.</p>
<p>The operations on the right and centre of the Third Army front now took the
form of an advance to complete the possession of the Forest of Mormal. On
November 5 the Thirty-third and Twenty-first Divisions were back in line, and,
working in close liaison with the Eighteenth Division on the left of the Fourth
Army, they pushed the advance up to the bank of the Sambre. Here it was found
that all bridges had been destroyed, and there was a check while the
Twenty-first to the north were making good the rest of the Forest and breaking
out in little groups of khaki from the eastern edge. That night they threw
light bridges over the Sambre and got some infantry across, the line running
from north of Leval to east of Berlaimont. The left of the Twenty-first
Division was still west of the river. Next day, November 6, the remorseless
advance still went on. Transport was failing, for the roads through the Forest
were impossibly bad, but nothing could stop the eager infantry, who were in
full cry with their quarry in the open. A number of villages were taken, each
of which was full of machine-guns, and showed some fight. By dusk the line of
the Avesnes&mdash;Bavay Road had been made good. On November 7 the German
retreat still continued, but the British had still to fight their way and their
progress was far from being a walking-tour. Both the Thirty-third and
Twenty-first had a sharp fight before they could dislodge the rearguards from
the Bois du Temple, Ecuelin, and Limont-Fontaine. Campbell's men had a
particularly hard task with the latter, which was strongly garrisoned and
stoutly defended, while the neighbouring village of Eclaises also presented a
bold front. There was a real close infantry battle, with some savage
house-to-house fighting, before these points could be cleared. 130 prisoners
were taken. The war had now left the open arable country and come into the
country of small enclosed orchards with high hedges, which blinded the German
observers, since they had already lost command of the air. This was a very
vital point. On November 8 the Welsh and Seventeenth were in the front line
once more, and the enemy was found to be still very organised and resolute on
this sector, fighting hard and with some success to hold the line of a
watercourse. Finally this opposition weakened, or it might be more fair to say
that the brave rearguard, having done its work, was withdrawn. On November 9
the Fifth Corps got along rapidly, gaining the eastern edge of the Bois du
Temple and the high ground east of Beaufort. For a time all contact was lost
with the enemy, who were rapidly retreating, and they were not located again
until they were on the line of the River Thure. The roads had been blown up,
and pursuit was much retarded. The difficulties of the advance were much
aggravated by the impossibility of getting the supplies forward. Many
delay-action mines had gone up in the railways in the rear, which prevented
rail-heads from being rapidly advanced. It is a fact, which is typical of the
ghoulish humour of German methods, that after several explosions in the Le
Cateau station it occurred to some one to dig up the graves which were marked
in German as covering the remains of some unknown British soldiers and were
placed near the line. In each case a delay-action mine was discovered all set
for different dates. It was determined, therefore, in order to economise
supplies, that a single Corps, the Sixth, should form the whole front of the
Third Army from this time onwards. This change was accomplished, and the
vanguard had just got in touch with the Germans on the River Thure, when the
historic November 11 came to end the hostilities.</p>
<p>The troops of the Fourth Corps had moved forward from November 4 onwards in
close liaison with the advance just recorded. The Fifth Division captured
Pont-sur-Sambre, Boussi&egrave;res, and St. Remy, while the Forty-second
occupied Hautmont, so that on November 9 the Corps line was the
Avesnes&mdash;Maubeuge Road. There they found themselves when the bugles
sounded the final "Cease fire." The record of Harper's Corps since August 21
can be tersely summed up in a few figures. They had lost 30,000 men. They had
captured 22,500 prisoners and 350 guns, fighting for ten weeks without rest or
break, and often in the worst of weather. The record of all the divisions was
splendid, but this is perhaps the place to say a special word about the New
Zealanders, which, in the judgement of many soldiers, was, if it be not
invidious to say so, equal to the very best division in France. When it is
stated that during the war they lost 57,632 men, and that the total number of
prisoners taken from them is reported to have been 45, these extraordinary
figures make all further comment superfluous. But what was particularly
remarkable was their appreciation of a military situation which more than once
altered the whole strategic situation. Thus it was their discovery that the
Crevecoeur bridge was intact, and their rapidity in seizing it and tenacity in
holding it and the village, which threatened the whole Beaurevoir line and
helped to reduce to nullity one of the greatest defences ever created by German
engineers. These men return to their island homes bearing with them the deep
admiration of their comrades and the gratitude of the Empire. They joined
discipline in peace to valour in war, and England was the poorer when the last
red hat-band was seen in the streets of her cities.</p>
<p>The Sixth Corps, after the battle of Mormal Forest, pushed on to the east,
and was rather impeded by the water-logged country than by the German
resistance. On November 6 there was a counter-attack upon the Sixty-second
Division, which made no headway and had heavy losses. Bavisaux, Obies, and many
other villages were taken, the church in the latter place containing thirty
machine-guns. The Guards on the left took Buvignies, while the Twenty-fourth
Division upon their north held the line of the Hongnau River. On November 7 the
resistance was still negligible, but the continuous rain and the wooded nature
of the country made rapid progress almost impossible. That evening General
Haldane received the surprising news that it was probable that the enemy would
send emissaries through the Allied lines with a view to negotiating an
armistice, his instructions being that if they approached his front they should
be detained pending instructions from higher authority. In the evening it was
learned that they had actually reached the French lines. The fighting still
continued, however, and on November 9 the Sixty-second Division had reached the
Sambre. The Guards on the same day pushed forward rapidly and entered the
citadel of Maubeuge in the afternoon. It was difficult to get touch with the
enemy, who were reported to be standing at Boussois. At this period, as already
told, the Sixth Corps took over the whole Army front, and was advancing upon
the Maubeuge&mdash;Charleroi front when the fateful hour struck.</p>
<p>The record of the Sixth Corps during their ten final weeks of work had been
a magnificent one, and was strangely parallel to that of the Fourth Corps on
their right. Their losses had been almost identical, about 30,000 men. Their
prisoners came to over 20,000 and their captured guns were 350. The Fifth
Corps, on the other hand, had endured more than its neighbours, having lost no
less than 34,000 men. It had captured 13,000 prisoners. Altogether the losses
of the Third Army during the final ten weeks had been 100,000 men, while they
had taken about 60,000 prisoners with nearly 1000 guns.</p>
<p>We have considered the advance of the three southern Corps of the Third
Army. In order to complete the record it is necessary to return to October 13,
and to trace the operations of Fergusson's Seventeenth Corps, which were left
on that date in front of the Selle River. On October 14 the 72nd Brigade of the
Twenty-fourth Division, which was in the van, gained a footing at the edge of
Haussy village, which straddles the river. On October 16 this same brigade took
the whole village on either bank. The left of the line was held up, however, by
a particularly heavy gas screen. Later in the day the Germans were into Haussy
once more, but again were pushed out from the western section of it, on which
they gas-shelled it, to the destruction of a number of unfortunate civilians
who had been unable to get away. 400 prisoners were taken during the day.
October 17 saw the British line where it had been on the 15th, as the gas
clouds hanging low over the river valley made the position down there
untenable.</p>
<p>On October 20, a rainy and tempestuous day, the general advance of the whole
Third Army was resumed. The Nineteenth Division having relieved the
Twenty-fourth, carried out the advance on the front of the Seventeenth Corps,
having in touch with it the Fourth Division of the Twenty-second Corps on the
left, and the Guards of the Sixth Corps on the right. The attack of the
Nineteenth Division had for its first objective the bridging of the Selle, the
capture of the railway and high ground beyond, and of the village of East
Haussy. The second stage should be the ridge to the east. Two brigades
advanced&mdash;the 57th on the left and the 58th on the right&mdash;behind a
fine barrage from eleven brigades of artillery.</p>
<p>The attack was started at 2 in the morning, and before 4 A.M. the 57th
Brigade were in the whole of Haussy, the resistance having been slight. At 6
o'clock the 8th Gloucesters, on the extreme right, had reached their final
objective, where they were endeavouring to get touch with the Guards in the
neighbourhood of Maison Blanche. The 10th War-wicks were held up on the left,
but soon cleared out the obnoxious pocket. By 9 o'clock the 58th Brigade was
also on its extreme limit, and an obstinate strong point was surrounded and
destroyed. In this brigade the 2nd Wiltshires had the worst ordeal, but they
won through at last. Patrols on the right had reached the banks of the Harpies.
The blow had, as must be admitted, been delivered in the air, but the river
line had been won, and that was the essential.</p>
<p>On October 23 the part played by the Seventeenth Corps was subsidiary to
that of the Corps to the north and to the south. On this date the Nineteenth
Division was ordered to protect the left flank of the Sixth Corps in its
advance on Romeries and Escarmain. This was duly carried out by the 8th
Gloucesters and 10th Warwicks, and contributed greatly to the victory in the
south. That night the Sixty-first South Midland Division took over from the
Nineteenth Division, with an ambitious programme for next day, October 24. In
the course of this attack the 183rd Brigade advanced on the right and the 182nd
on the left, their objectives including the villages of Bermerain, Vendegies,
and Sommaing. There followed a confused day of hard fighting, the general
movement being always from west to east. All three villages were most hotly
contested. Vendegies proved to be a special centre of resistance, but on the
morning of October 25 it was found to be unoccupied, and the whole resistance
had relaxed to such an extent that the front of the Army flowed slowly forward
with hardly a check, submerging fresh areas and villages until it had reached
the Rhonelle River, where a bridge-head was established on the front of the
Twenty-second Corps.</p>
<p>On November 1 the advance was resumed, when Maresches was attacked by the
Sixty-first Division, the Warwicks and Worcesters of the 182nd Brigade being in
the lead. The village was taken with about three hundred of the garrison.
Preseau on the left had fallen. This was the centre of a violent counter-attack
in the afternoon, which involved the right of the Fourth and the left of the
Sixty-first Divisions. Four German tanks co-operated, two of which were
destroyed by the British guns. This attack pressed back the advance from its
furthest point, but made no material change in the situation, though Preseau
was regained by the Germans, with the effect that their machine-guns from this
point held up the left flank of the 184th Brigade in their further advance.
Nearly 800 prisoners were made during the day.</p>
<p>The advance was renewed next morning, November 2, and again the resistance
seemed to wane, so that by midday the full objectives planned, but not
attained, on the previous day had been reached with little loss, the
Sixty-first moving onwards in close touch with the Fourth on their left and the
Second on their right. The Sixty-first were now drawn out of the line, and the
Nineteenth and Twenty-fourth each sent up a brigade to take their place.</p>
<p>November 3 found the front of the Corps still pushing forward without undue
opposition. In the late afternoon the 9th Cheshires of the 56th Brigade were in
Jenlain in touch with the Eleventh Division upon their left. The whole of the
Jenlain&mdash;Le Quesnoy Road had been reached along the Corps front, and once
again it seemed as if the cavalry might get their long-sought opportunity. Next
morning, however, November 4, found the stubborn German still standing grimly
on the defensive, and the infantry went forward once more to pitch-fork him a
little farther to the east. It was a great general attack in which the three
Armies, First, Third, and Fourth, all moved forward against the
Avesnes&mdash;Maubeuge&mdash;Mons line. On the front of the Seventeenth Corps
there was no very outstanding objective, and yet it was of course essential
that they should keep well up with the line, if only in order to cover the
flanks of their neighbours.</p>
<p>The right of the Corps when the advance began consisted of the 73rd Brigade
of the Twenty-fourth Division. On its left was the 56th Brigade, and to the
left of that the 58th, both of the Nineteenth Division. Both infantry and
artillery had to find their battle stations in pitch darkness, but all were in
their places at zero. At 6 o'clock the line went forward, faced in the first
instance by a small stream, the Petit Aunelle, which was safely crossed, though
its banks were in places 30 feet deep. At 10 o'clock both divisions had gained
the higher ground beyond the stream. By midday the Twenty-fourth Division had
reached the Great Aunelle River, and a party of the 7th Northamptons drove away
with their accurate rifle-fire the German sappers who were endeavouring to
destroy the bridge, but could not themselves cross on account of the heavy
German fire. The 2nd Wilts of the Nineteenth Division had their patrols in Eth.
To the north the Eleventh Division was over the river, and the German position
was rapidly becoming impossible, though they were counter-attacking with great
valour upon the farther bank of the stream. Before evening Wargnies had fallen
to the 9th Cheshires, and the whole British front was up to or over the
Aunelle. The advance was carried on in pouring rain on November 5, a further
area being gained up to the Hongnau River and the position strengthened, though
the amount of ground on the farther side of the river was still limited and
varied with the German counter-attacks which occasionally swept back the
intrusive bridgeheads, but only to have them re-established once more. The
troops were soaked, the ground was sodden, the infantry were over the ankles in
mud, and every one was exhausted.</p>
<p>On the morning of November 7 this line of the Hongnau had been abandoned by
the Germans and the advance was resumed. It must surely have been at this
period of the war one of the most impressive sights in the whole history of the
world, could one with a single sweeping glance have seen that gigantic line
from the left wing of the Belgians on the Dutch frontier to the right wing of
the French within view of the Swiss, moving forward every day, millions of men
advancing together, with the flash of their bayonets before them and the red
glare of their shells in front of them, while along that whole front of four
hundred miles the grey cloud, like some visible thing of evil, rolled slowly
back in front, leaving bare the ground which it had blighted and poisoned. It
was clear to all men that the end was near, and yet few dared to hope how near
it actually proved to be.</p>
<p>On November 7 the Twenty-fourth Division took over Bavay, which had just
been captured by the Guards. The weather conditions were more serious than the
German opposition, and the advance was held back by the dreadful roads. None
the less a long succession of villages were wrenched from the
enemy&mdash;Taisni&egrave;res, Feignies, and others&mdash;while on November 9
the Guards were in Maubeuge on the right. From this time there was practically
no more fighting, and only a slow advance on the one side and a slow retreat on
the other until the fateful November 11. To quote the memorandum of a General
Officer upon the spot: "The moral effect of retirement upon the enemy was very
marked, and it was found that even his machine-gunners, who had fought very
well all through our advance, were beginning to feel the effect, and would not
stand once a field-gun was brought up to deal with them."</p>

<h2><a id="chap10" name="chap10">X. THE ADVANCE OF HORNE'S FIRST ARMY</a><br>
From September 27 to the end</h2>
<p class="chaphead">The Canadians at the Canal du Nord&mdash;Hard fighting at
Bourlon&mdash;Strong counter attack at Abancourt&mdash;Canadian
valour&mdash;Godley's Twenty-Second Corps&mdash;The Ecaillon
valley&mdash;Forcing of the Rhonelle&mdash;General Heneker's
attack&mdash;Capture of Douai.</p>
<p class="first">ON September 27 the Canadian Corps, with the Eleventh British
Division, attacked once more, the advance joining the left flank of that huge
movement in which the First, Third, and Fourth Armies were all engaged. The
Twenty-second and Eighth Corps to the north were not engaged, but made a
vigorous demonstration in support. The Canadian attack, which began at early
dawn, was on a 6000-yard front, from Moeuvres in the south to the
Arras&mdash;Cambrai Road. In this advance the First and Fourth Canadian
Divisions were, in the first instance, to cross the Canal du Nord, and to
capture Bourlon Wood and village, with the high ground about Pilgrim's Rest.
This attack was in conjunction with one upon the right made by the Seventeenth
Corps, where the Fifteenth and Sixty-third Divisions stormed the line of the
Canal du Nord east and south-east of Moeuvres, as already recorded. This
movement was entirely successful, though there was very obstinate resistance at
Graincourt, which held up the advance for a time. The Fifty-seventh Division
passed through, however, to the north of this village and gained Cantaing and
Fontaine, so that the defenders of Graincourt, finding British troops behind
them, were forced to surrender.</p>
<p>The Canal du Nord had been emptied by the blowing up of sluice-gates, and
was quickly passed by the Canadian troops, who scrambled down one side and up
the other, with or without the aid of scaling-ladders. At the other side they
found much less resistance than had been expected, which was greatly the result
of a barrage which has seldom been equalled for accuracy and intensity.
Captured German officers declared that nothing could live under it. The German
guns were slow and feeble in their reply, and the whole work of the enemy
artillery at this period showed how nervous it had become through the recent
heavy captures, and how much they appreciated the necessity of keeping well to
the rear. The Canadian line poured on with little loss and did not halt until
it had seized its whole objective, including the ground about Bourlon, which
had been the scene of such bitter and fruitless fighting ten months before.
Guardsmen and Highlanders, men of Surrey and of Yorkshire, all who had fallen
upon and still lay within the soil of that sinister grove, were finally
justified and avenged that day. The whole manoeuvre, by which a large part of
the German line was taken in the rear, elicited expressions of surprise and
admiration from captured German officers.</p>
<p>In the second stage of the Canadian attack the First Canadian and the
Eleventh British Divisions&mdash;the latter on the extreme left&mdash;took up
the running, and carried the line forward in the direction of Raillencourt and
Haynecourt. In the afternoon the 169th Brigade of the Fifty-sixth Division also
came in upon the left, near the Arras&mdash;Cambrai Road, to clear the area
between the Eleventh Division and the Canal du Nord, the latter division having
taken Oisy-le-Verger. There was constant fighting during the day in this
quarter, the 168th Brigade coming into action to the left of the 169th, and
next morning the 8th Middlesex took Palluel. They also crossed the River
Sens&eacute;e and captured Arleux, but a strong barrage, followed by an
infantry attack, drove them out again at 3.30 on the morning of September 29.
All these attacks, both of the Eleventh and Fifty-sixth Divisions, were made,
after crossing the Canal du Nord, from south to north, so as to extend the left
flank of the Canadians.</p>
<p>One of the predominating factors in these operations was the great flood
caused by the blocking of the Trinquis and Sens&eacute;e rivers by the Germans,
which created wide lakes shown upon no map, across the front of the
Twenty-second Corps. As a matter of fact this development was regarded with
some complacency by General Godley, for there had always been a chance that the
Germans, by driving a really strong counter-attack along the line of the
Scarpe, might checkmate the whole British advance to the south. The effect of
the inundations was to fre&eacute; the British higher command from any fears of
the kind and to enable them to hold that part very lightly, while they
thickened their line elsewhere.</p>
<p>We have left the Canadian line on September 28. On this date the Third
Canadian Division, which had relieved part of the Fourth British on the right
of the Corps front, attacked with the 7th and 9th Brigades in the van. On its
left was the 10th Canadian Brigade, which in turn had the 2nd Canadian Brigade
to the north of it. The Third Canadian Division made good progress and pushed
through as far as Raillencourt, but the First Canadian Division remained
motionless, as it was already rather in front of the general line. The Eleventh
British Division was doing continuous good work in the north, but on the
morning of September 29 its 32nd Brigade was held up by a strong field of wire,
and the advance was checked in that quarter, but later in the day the whole
line pushed on once more, the order of brigades from the north being 32
(British), 2, 12, 7, 9 (all four Canadian). A mist covered the front, and from
the heart of this impenetrable cloud came the constant rattle of the German
fire, while their bullets swept every avenue of approach. The progress was
irregular, but by 9.45 in the morning the 12th Canadian Brigade had taken
Sancourt and had entered Blecourt, where some fierce bludgeon work was going
on. At 10 A.M. the 2nd Brigade had reached Abancourt station, but the Eleventh
Division were again held up in the north, which exposed the left flank of the
Canadians. South of the Bapaume Road the 9th Brigade was making steady
progress, while the 7th had reached Neuville St. Remy. For a moment the 12th
Canadian Brigade was staggered by a heavy counter which broke upon it, but the
ranks soon rallied and the ground was regained. It was desperately hard
fighting, however, and it was to continue day after day until all the northern
grit of General Currie's Corps was needed to sustain it. Early in the morning
of September 30 they were at it again, the immediate objects of the operations
being the capture of the bridge-heads on the Canal de l'Escaut by the Third and
Fourth Canadian Divisions, and secondly, that the high ground over the River
Sens&eacute;e should be secured by the First Canadians and Eleventh
British.</p>
<p>The attack began well, as the Third Canadian Division got Tilloy and the
Fourth got Blecourt. There was some progress also along the Cambrai Road, when
the 3rd Canadians got Petit Fontaine. It was "do or die" with the Germans,
however, who were keenly alive to the fact that at all costs they must hold the
bridge-heads of the Canal. They had put out a great effort, and had brought up
three new fighting divisions, making seven in all between Cambrai and the
Sens&eacute;e River. Counter-attacks rolled one after the other from the east,
but the Canadians showed themselves as stiff in defence as they were ardent in
attack. They might well be in high heart, for since September 27, 200 guns and
5500 prisoners were visible signs of their victory.</p>
<p>On October 1 the Fifty-sixth Division relieved the Eleventh and both
reverted to the Twenty-second Corps. At 5 A.M. on that date the Canadian attack
was renewed, synchronising with that of the Seventeenth Corps in the south and
the Twenty-second in the north. The order of brigades on the Canadian front
was, from the north, 1, 3, 11, and 9. The advance was made under a heavy
barrage, but it met with a most desperate resistance. In this and the following
day the Canadians experienced as heavy fighting as any in their great record.
By 8 o'clock the general line had got as far as Canal bank&mdash;Morenchies
Wood&mdash;Cuvillers&mdash;Bantigny&mdash;Abancourt. Shortly afterwards a very
heavy German attack struck the whole Corps front, rolling chiefly up the
Bantigny valley, the hostile infantry emerging from Paillencourt and thence
pouring forward with great determination in several lines. The 1st Canadian
Brigade in the north was bare upon its left flank and was in sore straits, but
the 3rd Brigade held on fast to the slope which leads down to the Canal. While
swarms of men attacked the British line a number of pockets developed in all
the ground which had been taken that day, so that the troops were shot at from
all sides. The British artillery came to the rescue, however, and caught the
German masses as they advanced with murderous results&mdash;one battery of
heavies firing 1600 rounds. None the less the enemy won back Abancourt, and
gained some ground along the whole front, the battle centring upon
Blecourt.</p>
<p>That night the British line, which was already much weakened by prolonged
fighting, and which was clearly opposed by superior forces, halted for a time
for reorganisation and reinforcement. It has since been proved that no fewer
than thirteen German divisions were thrown in upon this section of the
line.</p>
<p>The work of the Canadian Corps in crossing the Nord Canal, following upon
their splendid work in breaking the Qu&eacute;ant&mdash;Drocourt line,
reasserted the fact, so often demonstrated before, that there are no better
soldiers in the world than those of the Dominion. It has been impossible to
specify the innumerable acts of valour performed by these brave men, but
looking at the highest record of all, as chronicled during these few days of
battle, one finds that the Victoria Cross was awarded to Captain MacGregor and
Lieut. Kerr of the 1st Central Ontario Regiment, the first, after being himself
wounded, having killed four and taken eight of the enemy, while the latter
rushed a strong point single-handed and captured four machine-guns with
thirty-one prisoners. Lieut. Gregg, of the Nova Scotians, killed or wounded
eleven of the enemy and took twenty-five prisoners on September 28. Lieut.
Honey, of the 78th Manitobas, captured a whole nest of guns single-handed, with
ten prisoners, dying of wounds on the last day of the attack, while Sergeant
Merisfield of the 4th Central Ontarios cleared out two posts by his own
initiative, and fought after being wounded until a second wound left him
senseless upon the ground. Such were the iron men who have made the name of.
Canada great in the battlefields of Europe.</p>
<p>For the sake of connected narrative we may carry on the story of the
Canadians from October 2, when their weakened ranks, after their great and
continuous exertions, were held by the strong German array in front of
Abancourt. For the next few days, while gathering for a fresh spring, the
Canadians saw heavy palls of smoke over Cambrai, while at night the dull red
glow from great fires hinted at an approaching retreat. During the week which
followed, the Seventeenth Corps was, as has been told in their own chronicle,
making splendid progress to the south. On October 7 the Second and Third
Canadian Divisions, rested and strengthened, renewed their advance. On that
date they advanced with the old design of securing the bridge-heads over the
Canal, Pont d'Aire and Ramillies being their objectives, the latter a name of
good omen for any British operation. Rapid progress was made, and it was soon
evident that, be the machine-guns ever so numerous and spiteful, it was still
only a rear screen which faced the attack. The light of day had hardly come
before the 5th Brigade, after a short, sharp tussle, had possession of Pont
d'Aire, while the 6th Brigade got Ramillies. The 8th Brigade, to its own
amazement, crossed the Canal without opposition, and pushed its patrols into
Cambrai. It seems that at the moment of the attack the Germans were caught in
the confusion of their changes. On October 8 Cambrai was cleared, huge fires
were extinguished, and wires, by which the destruction of the town might be
completed, were traced and cut. An air reconnaissance at dawn on October 9
showed that the enemy had cleared away from the whole area between the
Sens&eacute;e Canal and the Canal de l'Escaut, having destroyed all the
Sens&eacute;e bridges. The Seventeenth Corps sent the Twenty-fourth Division
into Cambrai to take it over, while there was an immediate pursuit of the
retreating enemy, in which General Currie pushed forward a mobile column,
called Brutinel's Brigade, which contained light guns and the Canadian Light
Horse. Villages fell rapidly all along the line both to the Canadians and to
the British Eleventh Division on their left.</p>
<p>On October 10 a fresh line of resistance was reached, and the Canadian Corps
instantly attacked it, in conjunction with the Eleventh Division. The 4th
Canadian Brigade advanced swiftly and got Naves with little opposition. The 6th
Canadian Brigade took Thun St. Martin. The Eleventh Division got Estrun and
reached the edge of Hem Lenglet.</p>
<p>On October 11 the Second Canadian Division, together with the Forty-ninth
Yorkshire Territorials, who had relieved the Eleventh, continued their advance.
The Canadians met with heavy opposition from Iwuy, and in the forenoon there
came a heavy counter-attack, led by seven tanks, six of which paid the penalty.
On October 12 the First Canadian Division in the north found that their front
was apparently clear, so they swiftly advanced and took Arleux and
Estr&eacute;es, while the Twenty-second Corps attacked on their right and
reached Hordain. On this day was the fine attack, recorded elsewhere, of the
Fifty-sixth British Division, which got across the Canal at Aubigny. On October
17 the whole line of the Canal was clear, and the First Canadian Division
advanced towards Douai, which was occupied by the Eighth British Division from
the north.</p>
<p>No further important services were exacted from the Canadian Corps, which
had done its share, and more than its share, of the work, so that it retired
from the line with the warm admiration and respect of every British soldier who
had had experience of it. From its first dreadful baptism of fire, when it
faced without masks the unknown horrors of the poison gas, down to the campaign
in which it broke the great Qu&eacute;ant switch line, and forced the Canal du
Nord, there was never one single occasion upon which the Canadians did not rise
to the highest point of military virtue in actual battle. Their record will be
fully set out in many a book which will deal fully and in detail with their
great deeds. Such a chronicle as this can only hope to help the reader to fit
that fuller and more worthy record into the general plan.</p>
<p>We shall now follow the work of Godley's Twenty-second Corps from the time
that its right flank crossed the Canal du Nord in the Marquion sector, taking
its operations consecutively, and linking them up with the Canadians on the
south, who were now, as already recorded, advancing upon Cambrai, bursting
through every obstacle as they went. Early in October Hunter-Weston's Eighth
Corps extended down to the Scarpe. There was great preparation for the future,
but no actual fighting, save for some outpost bickerings between the 12th
Brigade of the Fourth Division and the Germans on the north of the Trinquis
brook, in the course of which the British posts were attacked&mdash;one of them
as many as eight times&mdash;but remained untaken. On October 7 the guns of the
Twenty-second Corps co-operated in the attack made on that day by the Eighth
Corps in the north which captured Biache St. Vaast, and a portion of the
Fresnes&mdash;Rouvroy line. On October 9 there was a reconnaissance of the
northern part of the Drocourt&mdash;Qu&eacute;ant line by strong patrols, but
it was found that it was still strongly held. It was at this period that the
Canadian Corps was brought across to the left of the Twenty-second Corps, while
the latter moved south, so that it now lay between the Cambrai&mdash;Saulzoir
Road and the Canal de l'Escaut. Whilst this considerable movement was in
progress, on October 11 the Eighth Corps on the north captured the portion of
the Drocourt line which was opposite to it. The Fifty-sixth Division and First
Canadians, who were on the immediate south, took some part in the fray, the
Londoners capturing Fresnes, and the Canadians the high ground which faced
them. After the change was carried out, the front east of Cambrai was held by
the Forty-ninth Yorkshire Division on the right and by the Fifty-first
Highlanders on the left.</p>
<p>Immediately before these fresh dispositions were carried out in the south,
there was a sharp action in this sector, in which, under the direction of
General Currie, the Second Canadians and the Forty-ninth British attacked Iwuy
and the ground south-west of it. This was on October 11. The attack gained
ground and some hundreds of prisoners, but the losses were in excess of the
gains, especially in the case of the Yorkshire Territorials, who suffered
considerably in a counter-attack which was urged with the help of tanks. On the
morning of October 12 the Fifty-first Highlanders had taken over from the
Canadians and carried on the operation. All day there was sharp fighting in
front of the British divisions. The Forty-ninth made good progress and followed
up the retreating enemy, but the Fifty-first found a stiff opposition on the
left, where the Germans held fast to Lieu St. Amand, powerfully supported by
their guns on the north bank of the Canal de l'Escaut. The right of the
Highland Division captured Avesnes-le-Sec, and so came level with the left of
the Forty-ninth. This latter division had continual fighting at Haspres and
Saulzoir on to the line of the Selle.</p>
<p>On October 13 the action was renewed, both the British divisions striving
hard to push through the German rearguards, which were very strong and were
backed by powerful artillery from north and east. Progress was slow, for the
country was an open plain without a vestige of cover. The enemy were holding
the Canadians to the north of the Escaut Canal, and so were able to keep their
guns well forward on that side, to enfilade the advance to the south, and to
support their position on the Selle. The British had come into the region of
the civil population, so that they had to be chary and discriminating in the
use of their guns, while gas shells could hardly be used at all. The Third Army
had now got so far ahead that it was compelled to pause for supplies, and the
First Army was forced to conform.</p>
<p>Cameron's Forty-ninth Division was much exhausted by its exertions, so the
Fourth British Division came up about October 15 to relieve it. It met with a
sad misfortune immediately after it had taken its place in the line, as its
commanding officer, General Lipsett, was killed while carrying out a
reconnaissance in front of the line. He had recently been transferred from a
Canadian division, and had a great war record, extending back to near the
beginning. It is indeed tragic when one who has played a great part in the
drama leaves before the final curtain falls. General Lucas took over the
division.</p>
<p>There was no change in the situation so far as the Twenty-second Corps was
concerned until October 19, when the enemy began to retire in front of the
Highland Division, in conformity with a movement which had already begun north
of L'Escaut, and which spread down to the front of the Fourth Division. The
Germans had prepared a line of defence upon the Ecaillon River in the rear, and
were now letting go of the Selle in order to reassemble their forces upon this
even stronger front. The withdrawal was irregular, so that some parts of his
array remained hard when others had almost ceased to exist. Thus at Haspres and
the part of the Selle to the north of it, there was still some stiff fighting.
He abandoned Saulzoir, however, and the Fourth Division promptly established a
bridge-head which should be the base for a future advance. On the Fifty-first
Divisional front the pursuit was so rapid, both by the Highlanders and by the
Corps Cavalry, that there was not much time for reorganisation.</p>
<p>During October 20 and 21 the Germans were slowly pressed back from the high
ground east of the Selle into the Ecaillon valley, and artillery was pushed up
to prepare for a further attack upon the new line. The sappers did some great
work in throwing, under fire, many bridges over the Selle. Noyelles and Douchy
were occupied on the morning of October 20. The river was found to be strongly
wired, and there were scattered lines of trenches on the farther side, which
made up a strong, fortified position, called by the Germans the Hermanstellung.
It was clearly a more elaborate position than that of the Selle. None the less
the infantry was not to be denied and the troops crossed the river by wading,
the water in many cases being up to the armpits of the men. The 10th and 11th
Brigades of the Fourth Division fought their way half-way up the north-eastern
slope of the valley, past the villages of Verchain and Moncheaux. The 1st
Somersets and 1st Hants occupied the latter and pushed through it, securing the
high ground east of the villages, but they found that their comrades of the 2nd
West Riding and 1st Warwicks were held up by the German main line upon the
crest of the hill, and that the Sixty-first Division, the nearest unit on their
right, were temporarily checked at Vendegies. The 2nd West Riding got forward,
however, and occupied a position on the crest called "The Pimple," whilst the
Fifty-first Division on the north of the 11th Brigade also got well forward up
to the village of Maing. In the morning of October 25 the 12th Brigade took up
the task in this sector, the 1st King's Own on the right and the 2nd Essex on
the left advancing without any very serious opposition, being in touch with the
left of the Seventeenth Corps. In the late afternoon the Germans reacted
strongly, and there was a counter-attack upon the front of the 2nd Lancashire
Fusiliers and upon the Highlanders to their left, but it had little effect. The
154th Brigade of Highlanders was very heavily engaged during this strenuous
day, and the 6/7th Argyll and Sutherlands, among others, had serious losses.
Among many brave deeds that of Lieut. Bissett is conspicuous, for he won the
V.C. by repeated acts of gallantry, leading his men in a desperate bayonet
charge, after all their ammunition was expended, and so saving the line. Before
evening the village of Querenaing had been occupied and the line of the
Artres&mdash;Famars Road; 1200 more prisoners were in the Corps cage.</p>
<p>The attack upon the Ecaillon position was a difficult military operation,
and one which showed very clearly the marked ascendancy which the British
soldier had gained over his German rival. Every factor was in favour of the
defence, and yet the line was rapidly shattered by the determined advance of
the two divisions concerned. The object of the action was not merely the gain
of ground, though that was considerable, but it was to cover the left of the
Third Army and also to assist in the advance of the Canadian Corps towards
Valenciennes, all of which aims were fully carried out. The action of the
infantry was all the finer because they entirely lost the time-table barrage,
and had to depend upon their own fine courage and the tactical skill of their
leaders. In the actual crossing of the river all ranks showed great gallantry
and determination. The method in which the advance was pressed and the victory
followed up by very weary soldiers was remarkable, and resulted, among other
things, in the capture of the bridge-head of Artres by the Fourth Division,
which proved of great value both to the Seventeenth and to the Twenty-second
Corps.</p>
<p>A railway from Valenciennes to Le Quesnoy ran across the front of the Corps,
and this was made the forming-up point for the renewed attack next morning,
when the Fourth and the tireless Fifty-first went forward again under a heavy
barrage. Having lost the successive lines of the Selle and the Ecaillon, the
Germans were now lining up on the east bank of the Rhonelle, prepared to make a
resolute defence. A party of the 2nd Lancashire Fusiliers got across, however,
on the morning of the 26th, and established a bridge-head, and joined hands
with a party from the Sixty-first Division on their right, who had also forded
the stream. This point held firm, but when the 2nd Essex on the left attempted
also to cross, there was a stubborn resistance. With field-guns in the face of
them and a raking fire from machine-guns at Gaumont Farm on their left flank,
this brave battalion had a bad half-hour. The Germans then counter-attacked,
falling upon both the Highlanders and the Essex men, but both stood firm,
though the gas with which the whole position was drenched made the defence
difficult. In this action the leading battalion of Highlanders at the point
attacked, the 6th Argyll and Sutherlands, dashed forward with the bayonet at
the advancing Germans and drove them pell-mell back; 212 more prisoners were
secured.</p>
<p>The situation on October 26 was that the Corps front was well up to the
River Rhonelle, that the Fourth Division had taken Artres and established a
post across the river, and that the Fifty-first had got as far as Famars, which
it had occupied. Attempts of the Fourth Division to enlarge their holding on
the east of the stream had no good result, but the bridge-head was still held
against all attacks. On the 27th the Germans attacked the Highlanders and
forced their way into Famars, but were again met with the cold steel, this time
by the 4th Gordons, and thrown out of the village. Next morning, October 28,
the Fifty-first advanced its line, making a lodgment upon Mont Houy on its left
flank, and capturing Poirier station. Here they were stopped by a strong German
attack. It must be admitted that, considering the incessant retreats and the
heavy punishments which they had received, the German troops showed a fine
constancy in these numerous but useless efforts to throw back the advance. On
October 30 the Fifty-first Division was drawn into reserve and the Forty-ninth
took their place in the line. Although there had been no eastward movement
during the last few days, the Highlanders had spent them in an incessant
pressure to the north-east, to aid the advance upon Valenciennes. By this means
a good jumping-off place was secured, from which a Canadian brigade was to
attack Valenciennes from the south, in conjunction with the main attack upon
the Rhonelle line. The Highlanders withdrew from the line in great heart but
very exhausted by a long spell of ceaseless work.</p>
<p>On November 1, under a tremendous artillery barrage, the Twenty-second Corps
advanced to the forcing of the Rhonelle, the third river front within a
fortnight. If the operation were successful it would be decisive of the fate of
Valenciennes. The men were very weary, and their ranks had been thinned by the
influenza microbe as much as by bullets, but they were cheered by victory and
the visible signs of progress in the virgin country all around them. The Fourth
Division were still on the right, and the Forty-ninth Yorkshire Territorials on
the left. The 11th Brigade held the all-important bridge-head, and across it
went the 1st Rifle Brigade, while the 1st Hants forded the river on their left.
The crossing was accomplished with no great difficulty, and once across the
advance was rapidly pushed. Preseau village was the first objective on this
wing of the attack. The resistance was unequal and was soon disposed of, and
the village was taken, together with the line of the Preseau&mdash;Marly Road.
About ten o'clock there came a strong German counter-attack, which got round
both flanks of the Rifle Brigade and practically surrounded them, so that the
leading companies were hard put to it to fight their way back into the village
and out to the west of it. The machine-gun fire was very severe. This attack
was purely local, and did not affect the Hampshires or the Forty-ninth
Division. Low-flying aeroplanes aided the German infantry, but were more
alarming than dangerous. Eventually the Rifle Brigade dug in about 400 yards
west of the village; 1700 prisoners were taken during the day.</p>
<p>Following the policy of giving the Germans no rest, both divisions attacked
again next morning. The 2nd Seaforths of the 10th Brigade were on the right and
the 1st King's Own of the 12th Brigade on the left of the Fourth Division's
front. The German resistance, which was expected to be strong after the
counter-attacks of the day before, suddenly collapsed, and Preseau was taken
once more. So was the dangerous high ground 700 yards to the east, which was
bristling with machine-guns. The Yorkshiremen on the left had advanced with
equal bravery, and had taken the steel works south of Marly. Altogether about
1000 more prisoners were taken. That night the Eleventh Division relieved the
Fourth, while the Fifty-sixth took the place of the Forty-ninth. The latter
division was very weak in numbers, so Blacklock's Sixty-third Naval Division
was transferred to the Twenty-second Corps in order to help cover the widening
front.</p>
<p>It is worth recording that in all this recent fighting, with its
approximation to open warfare, the youths who now made up the bulk of the
fighting divisions were found to acquit themselves manfully. Their only
deterioration from the older type was in their power of endurance and of
resistance to weather, so that after two rough days there was a distinct
weakening of their powers. They were trained to use their individual minds in
the assault, advancing in small independent sections in single file. "In open
country the employment of waves in the attack is criminal"&mdash;such was one
of the last military notes of the war.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of November 3 the enemy showed clear signs of having
had enough, and was withdrawing along the whole front, closely pursued by
mounted troops and by infantry. Curgies and Saultain were taken, and the line
rapidly extended. On November 4 the pace accelerated, and the crossings of the
River Aunelle were forced, the Eleventh Division having a sharp fight at
Sebourg. On November 5 the Belgian frontier was crossed and the villages of
Mesaurain, Boisin, and Angre were occupied. There was some fighting on this
day, the 168th Brigade having a sharp skirmish at Angre. Three tanks of British
pattern were captured during the day. On November 6 the Grande Aunelle River
had to be crossed, and the Germans made a resistance which at one time was both
strenuous and successful. There was a great deal of gas, and all troops had to
wear their masks. The Eleventh Division was unable to reach the river on
account of the long open slope down which any advance must be made. The
Fifty-sixth Division got across south of Angre, and reached the high ground to
the east, the 2nd London and London Rifle Brigade in the lead. The former
battalion was heavily counter-attacked in the Bois de Beaufort and was driven
back to the river, while the London Rifle Brigade also suffered heavy
casualties from machine-gun fire from Angre. Forty men of the 2nd Londons were
entirely cut off but held on in a deep ditch in the wood, and were surrounded
by the enemy. None the less they managed to cut their way out and rejoin their
battalion.</p>
<p>On the left of the attack the Kensingtons and London Scottish crossed the
river and got possession of Angre. They found themselves involved in a very
fierce fight, which swayed backwards and forwards all day, each side attacking
and counter-attacking with the utmost determination. Twice the Londoners were
driven back and twice they regained their objectives, ending up with their grip
still firm upon the village, though they could not retain the high ground
beyond. Late at night, however, the 168th Brigade established itself almost
without opposition upon the ridge.</p>
<p>On November 7 the opposition had wilted away and the Twenty-second Corps
advanced with elements of three divisions in front, for the naval men were now
in line on the left, "on the starboard bow of the Second Canadians," to quote
their own words. The river was crossed on the whole front and a string of
villages were occupied on this and the following days. The rain was pouring
down, all bridges had been destroyed, the roads had been blown up, and
everything was against rapidity of movement. None the less the front flowed
ever forward, though the food problem had become so difficult that advanced
troops were supplied by aeroplane. The 16th Lancers had joined the Australian
Light Horse, and the cavalry patrols pushed far ahead. Bavay was taken on
November 10, and the Corps front had reached one mile east of Villers St.
Ghislain when, on November 11, the "cease-fire" was sounded and the white flag
appeared.</p>
<p>The general experience of the Twenty-second Corps during these last weeks of
the war was that the German rearguards consisted mainly of machine-guns, some
of which were fought as bravely as ever. The infantry, on the other hand, were
of low morale and much disorganised. Need for mounted troops who could swiftly
brush aside a thin line and expose a bluff was much felt. The roads were too
muddy and broken for the cyclists, and there was no main road parallel with the
advance. Owing to his machine-guns and artillery the enemy was able always to
withdraw at his own time. 3200 prisoners had been taken by the Twenty-second
Corps in the final ten days.</p>
<p>In dealing with the advance of Horne's First Army we have examined the
splendid work of the Canadian Corps and of the Twenty-second Corps. We must now
turn to the operations of Hunter-Weston's Eighth Corps on the extreme north of
this Army, linking up on the left with the right of Birdwood's Fifth Army in
the neighbourhood of Lens. Up to the end of September, save for local
enterprises, neither the Eighth Division on the right nor the Twentieth on the
left had made any serious movement. The time was not yet ripe. At the close of
September, however, when the line was all aflame both to the south and in
Flanders, it was clear that the movement of the British Armies must be a
general one. At that date the Eighth Division extended its flank down to the
Scarpe, where it was in touch with the Forty-ninth Division, forming the left
of Godley's Twenty-second Corps. Before effecting this change Heneker, on
September 21, carried out a spirited local attack with his own division, by
which he gained important ground in the Oppy and Gavrelle sectors. It was a
hard fight, in which the 2nd Berks had specially severe losses, but a
considerable area of important ground was permanently gained.</p>
<p>Early in October General Heneker proceeded to carry out an ambitious scheme
which he had meditated for some time, and which had now received the
approbation of his Corps Commander. This was an attack by his own division upon
the strong Fresnes&mdash;Rouvroy line, to the north-east of Arras. His plan was
to make a sudden concentrated assault upon the south end of this formidable
deeply-wired line, and then to work upwards to the north, avoiding the perils
and losses of a frontal advance. This enterprise was begun at 5 A.M. on October
7, and was carried through with that mixture of dash and skill which marks the
ideal operation. The 23rd and 25th Brigades supplied the storm-troops, who were
drawn from the 2nd Middlesex, 2nd West Yorks, and 2nd Devons, and attacked on a
front of 3500 yards. The gain of ground was nearly two miles; the line was
broken and Biache was taken. On the next day, October 8, the northward turning
movement was carried through, the 1st Worcesters, 1st Sherwood Foresters, and
2nd Berkshires pushing into the front line, the work being mainly carried out
by bombing. Altogether 37 machine-guns and 250 prisoners were taken, together
with the villages of Fresnes and Neuvireuil, so that the divisional front was
now brought opposite the Drocourt&mdash;Qu&eacute;ant line.</p>
<p>This strong triple system of the Hindenburg type was attacked in the early
morning of October 11 in this sector by Grogan's 23rd Brigade, and by 7 A.M.
both the 2nd Middlesex and 2nd Devons were through it, holding the whole front
before them, with the exception of the town of Vitry on the Scarpe. The Twelfth
Division had taken the place of the Twentieth on the left of the Eighth, and it
had also fought its way forward, but it was still short of striking distance
and could not take part in the attack. The chief danger was from the south, as
the floods in the Trinquis River were holding up the First Canadian Division in
that quarter, so that the German guns could all swing their muzzles to the
north. This was obviated by a free use of smoke and gas, so that the British
infantry were shrouded on their right flank. The barrage, by a very ingenious
device, was not put down in such a fashion as to pin the Germans to their
positions and make it more dangerous to fly than to stand, but it was poured
upon one spot, and then moved slowly up the line at the rate of 100 yards in
eight minutes, giving the garrison plenty of time to see and to avoid it by a
timely flight, which most of them preferred to do. When the new position, which
soon included Vitry, had been occupied, some of the 2nd Middlesex scrambled
across the Scarpe by a broken bridge and took Mont Metier, the strong point on
the left front of the Canadians, in the rear, so as to help their future
advance. The total gain was not less than an average of three miles, with
Cuincy in the centre as the most advanced point. The German line was now
shattered, and though there were sporadic bickerings and resistance, with a
constant resource to the ignoble warfare of land mines and booby traps, there
was no serious battle. In a single day the Tunnelling Companies, which were
always ready for any desperate service, removed 300 mines. On October 14 the
Twelfth Division, after a spirited attack, captured Auby on the left, while the
Canadians on the right had got up to the Douai Canal. On the 17th the German
line was clearly recoiling, and a personal reconnaisance by Colonel Roberts of
the 1st Worcesters showed that there was hope for an advance over the canal. At
2 P.M. accordingly the 2nd Rifle Brigade went forward, and their patrols, with
those of the 2nd Middlesex, entered the historic old city of Douai, taking down
the German flag which was still flying from the town hall. "The town was found
to be fairly intact," says a general officer on the spot, "but the inside of
every house had been stripped of everything of value, and what had not been
removed had been smashed to atoms...The inside and reeds of the beautiful organ
in the Cathedral had been torn out, and lay in a heap on the floor." There is
no doubt that President Wilson's note on this subject had an effect in
preventing the destruction of towns from this time onwards, and that it was the
salvation of Douai. No inhabitants had been left in the town.</p>
<p>From this period the advance on this front was a slow but steady triumphant
progress. By the end of October the Eighth Division had gone forward more than
thirty miles since it started, and had captured thirty-five towns and villages,
including Douai, Marchiennes, and St. Amand. Beyond being greatly plagued by
murderous explosive traps, 1400 of which were discovered, and being much
incommoded by the destruction of roads and bridges and by the constant canals
across its path, there was no very serious resistance. Great floods early in
November made the situation even more difficult. On November 5 the Eighth
Division was relieved by the Fifty-second, and quitted the line for the last
time.</p>
<p>This splendid division has had some injustice done to it, since it was the
one Regular division in France in 1914 which was somewhat invidiously excluded
from the very special and deserved honours which were showered upon "the first
seven divisions." But even in 1914 it had done splendid work, and as to its
performance in the following years, and especially in 1918, when it was
annihilated twice over, it will live for ever, not only in the records of the
British Army, but in that of the French, by whose side it fought in the direst
crisis and darkest moment of the whole campaign. There were no further
movements of importance on the front of the Eighth Corps, and the completion of
their history covers the whole operation of Horne's First Army in this final
phase of the war. It was indeed a strange freak of fate that this general, who
commanded the guns of the right wing at Mons in that momentous opening battle,
should four and a half years later be the commander who brought his victorious
British Army back to that very point.</p>

ARMIES</a><br>
September 28&mdash;November 11</h2>
<p class="chaphead">King Albert in the field&mdash;Great Belgo-Franco-British
advance&mdash;The last act on the old stage&mdash;The prophet of
1915&mdash;Renewed advance&mdash;Germans desert the coast&mdash;Relief of Douai
and Lille&mdash;The final stage of the subsidiary theatres of war.</p>
<p class="first">WE have followed the operations of the three southern British
Armies from the first blow on August 8&mdash;a blow which Ludendorff has stated
made him surrender the last hope of ultimate victory&mdash;through all their
uninterrupted progress of victory until the final armistice. We shall now turn
to the northern end of the British line, where the two remaining Armies, the
Fifth in the Nieppe district and the Second in the area of Ypres, were waiting
impatiently for their share in the advance. Flanders was a convalescent home
for divisions, and there was not a unit there which was not stiff with
half-healed wounds, but these Armies included many of the grand old formations
which had borne the stress of the long fight, and they were filled with the
desire to join in the final phase. Their chance came at last, though it was a
belated one.</p>
<p>There were many indications in the third week of July that the Germans had
planned one of their great attacks upon the front of Birdwood's Fifth Army in
the Nieppe district. The succession of blows which rained upon Hindenburg's
line in the south made it impossible, however, for him to attempt a new
offensive. There was considerable activity along the British line, and a
constant nibbling which won back by successive ventures much of the ground
which had been gained by the Germans in April. Early in July the Fifth
Division, forming the left unit of the Fifth Army, advanced from the edge of
Nieppe Forest, where they had lain since their return from Italy, and gained a
stretch of ground&mdash;the first sign of the coming recoil in the north. To
the left of them lay De Lisle's Fifteenth Corps, which moved forward in turn,
effecting a series of small but important advances which were eclipsed by the
larger events in the south, but reacted upon those events, since they made it
impossible for the Germans to detach reinforcements. On July 19 the Ninth
Division with a sudden spring seized Meteren with 453 prisoners, while on the
same date the First Australian Division occupied Merris to the south of it. On
August 9 the movement spread farther south, and the Thirty-first Division took
Vieux Berquin. There was a slow steady retraction of the German line from this
time onwards, and a corresponding advance of the British. On August 30 the
ruins of Bailleul passed into the hands of the Twenty-ninth Division. On
September 1 Neuve Eglise was submerged by the creeping tide, while on the 3rd
Nieppe also was taken. Finally on September 4 two brigades of the Twenty-ninth
Division, the 88th under Freyberg and the 86th under Cheape, captured
Ploegsteert by a very smart concerted movement in which 250 prisoners were
taken. Up to this date De Lisle's Fifteenth Corps had advanced ten miles with
no check, and had almost restored the original battle line in that
quarter&mdash;a feat for which M. Clemenceau awarded the General special thanks
and the Legion of Honour.</p>
<p>All was ready now for the grand assault which began on September 28 and was
carried out by the Belgians and French in the north and by Plumer's Second
British Army in the south. The left of this great force was formed by nine
Belgian and five French infantry divisions, with three French cavalry divisions
in reserve. The British Army consisted of four corps: Jacob's Second Corps
covering Ypres, Watts' Nineteenth Corps opposite Hollebeke, Stephens' Tenth
Corps facing Messines, and De Lisle's Fifteenth Corps to the south of it. The
divisions which made up each of these Corps will be enumerated as they come
into action. To complete the array of the British forces it should be said that
Birdwood's Fifth Army, which linked up the First Army in the south and the
Second in the north, consisted at that date of Haking's Eleventh and Holland's
First Corps covering the Armentieres&mdash;Lens front, and not yet joining in
the operations. The whole operation was under the command of the chivalrous
King of the Belgians, who had the supreme satisfaction of helping to give the
<i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i> to the ruffianly hordes who had so long ill-used his
unfortunate subjects.</p>
<p>The operations of the Belgians and of the French to the north of the line do
not come within the scope of this narrative save in so far as they affected the
British line. General Plumer's attack was directed from the Ypres front, and
involved on September 28 two Corps, the Second on the north and the Nineteenth
on the south. The order of divisions from the left was the Ninth (Tudor) and
the Twenty-ninth (Cayley), with the Thirty-sixth Ulsters (Coffin) in reserve.
These constituted Jacob's Second Corps, which was attacking down the old Menin
Road. South of this point came the Thirty-fifth (Marindin) and the Fourteenth
Division (Skinner), with Law-ford's Forty-first Division in support. These
units made up Watts' Nineteenth Corps. On the left of Jacob's was the Belgian
Sixth Division, and on the right of Watts' the British Tenth Corps, which was
ordered to undertake a subsidiary operation which will presently be described.
We shall now follow the main advance.</p>
<p>This was made without any bombardment at 5 in the morning of September 28,
behind a heavy barrage which swept eastwards at the rate of 100 yards every
three minutes. The Germans had clearly sent away reinforcements to the south
and were weak in numbers as well as in spirit. The result was a very complete
victory all along the line, and before evening Plumer's men had passed over all
the ground which had been previously contested. For the last time the roar of
battle went down the old Menin Road and rose from historic Gheluvelt. The Ninth
and Twenty-ninth Divisions swept everything before them, and before evening it
was not only Gheluvelt but Zandvoorde, Kruiseik, and Becelaere which had passed
into their possession. The Belgians on the left had cleared the whole of
Houthulst Forest, that lowering menace which had hung so long before their
line. Zonnebeke and Poelcappelle had also passed into the hands of the Allies.
It was a great victory, and it was not marred by heavy losses to the victors.
Those of Jacob's Corps were not more than 1100, while their prisoners were
2100. The total of prisoners came to 10,000, with more than 100 guns.</p>
<p>On September 29 the advance was resumed with ever-increasing success all
along the line. The Scots of the Ninth Division, working in close liaison with
the Belgians, got Waterdamhoek, and detached one brigade to help our Allies in
taking Moorslede, while another took Dadizeele, both of them far beyond our
previous limits. The Twenty-ninth Division still pushed along the line of the
Menin Road, while the Thirty-sixth Ulsters fought their way into Terhand. In
this quarter alone in front of Jacob's Second Corps fifty guns had been taken.
Meanwhile the Nineteenth Corps on the right was gaining the line of the Lys
River, having taken Zandvoorde and Hollebeke; while the Thirty-fourth and
Thirtieth Divisions of the Tenth Corps were into Wytsohaete and up to Messines,
and the Thirty-first Division of the Fifteenth Corps was in St. Yves. In these
southern sectors there was no attempt to force the pace, but in the north the
tide was setting swiftly eastwards. By the evening of September 29 Ploegsteert
Wood was cleared and Messines was occupied once again. The rain had started, as
is usual with. Flemish offensives, and the roads were almost impossible; but by
the evening of October 1 the whole left bank of the Lys from Comines southward
had been cleared. On that date there was a notable hardening of the German
resistance, and the Second Corps had some specially fierce fighting. The
Ulsters found a tough nut to crack in Hill 41, which they gained twioe and lost
twice before it was finally their own. The Ninth Division captured Ledeghem,
but was pushed to the west of it again by a strong counter-attack. Clearly a
temporary equilibrium was about to be established, but already the advance
constituted a great victory, the British alone having 5000 prisoners and 100
guns to their credit.</p>
<p>In the meantime Birdwood's Fifth Army, which had remained stationary between
the advancing lines of the Second Army in Flanders and of the First Army south
of Lens, began also to join in the operations. The most successful military
prophet in a war which has made military prophecy a by-word, was a certain
German regimental officer who was captured in the La Bass&eacute;e district
about 1915, and who, being asked when he thought the war would finish, replied
that he could not say when it would finish, but that he had an opinion as to
where it would finish, and that would be within a mile of where he was
captured. It was a shrewd forecast based clearly upon the idea that each side
would exhaust itself and neither line be forced, so that a compromise peace
would become necessary. For three years after his dictum it still remained as a
possibility, but now at last, within six weeks of the end, La Bass&eacute;e was
forced, and early in October Ritchie's Sixteenth Division, the Fifty-fifth West
Lancashire Territorials, and the Nineteenth Division under Jeffreys, were all
pressing on in this quarter, with no very great resistance. South of Lens the
Twentieth Division (Carey) had been transferred from the left of the First Army
to the right of the Fifth, and this had some sharp fighting on October 2 at
Mericourt and Acheville. Both north and south of the ruined coal capital the
British infantry was steadily pushing on, pinching the place out, since it was
bristling with machine-guns and very formidable if directly attacked. The
Twelfth Division (Higginson), fresh from severe service in the south and
anaemic from many wounds, occupied 11,000 yards between Oppy and Lens from
October 7 onwards. Their orders were to press the enemy at the first sign of
retreat. All three brigades were in the line, each with its own artillery, to
give greater independence. The German withdrawal was gradual but there was some
hard rearguard fighting, especially at the strong line of the Haute Deule
Canal. There was little cover for the troops at this point save where some
ruined hamlets screened their ranks. These flat levels leading up to wire and
water could have been made a Golgotha had the Germans been of the old temper,
but they were oppressed by the general wilting of their line. The 1st Cambridge
captured Auby on October 14 and so got to the edge of the Canal. On the 16th
the 5th Berks got across the broken bridge at Pont-a-Sault, though they could
hardly deploy upon the farther side. After this date the only obstacle to the
advance was the supply question, for the villagers were all clamouring for food
and sharing the scanty rations of the soldiers. On October 23 the Scarpe was
crossed, Lieutenant Egerton of the 87th Field Company RE. gallantly bridging
the stream and losing his life in the effort. The 6th West Kents got across at
Nivelle, but had the misfortune to lose their splendid commander, Colonel
Dawson, who had already been wounded six times in the course of the war. Upon
October 23 the Twelfth was relieved by the Fifty-second Division upon this
front.</p>
<p>The attack in the north had been held partly by the vile weather and partly
by the inoreased German resistance. The Twenty-ninth Division had got into
Gheluvelt but was unable to retain it. The enemy counter-attacks were frequent
and fierce, while the impossible roads made the supplies, especially of
cartridges, a very serious matter. The worn and rutted Menin Road had to
conduct all the traffic of two Army Corps. No heavy artillery could be got up
to support the weary infantry, who were cold and wet, without either rest or
cover. Time was needed, therefore, to prepare a further attack, and it was
October 14 before it was ready. Then, as before, the Belgians, French, and
British attacked in a single line, the advance extending along the whole
Flemish front between the Lys River at Comines and Dixmude in the north, the
British section being about ten miles from Comines to the Menin&mdash;Roulers
Road.</p>
<p>Three British Corps were engaged, the Second (Jacob), the Nineteenth
(Watts), and the Tenth (Stephens), the divisions, counting from the south,
being the Thirtieth, Thirty-fourth, Forty-first, Thirty-fifth, Thirty-sixth,
Twenty-ninth, and Ninth. The three latter divisions, forming the front of
Jacob's Corps, came away with a splendid rush in spite of the heavy mud and
soon attained their immediate objectives. Gulleghem, in front of the Ulsters,
was defended by three belts of wire, garnished thickly with machine-guns, but
it was taken none the less, though it was not completely occupied until next
day. Salines had fallen to the Twenty-ninth Division, and by the early
afternoon of October 15 both divisions were to the east of Heule. Meanwhile
Cuerne and Hulste had been cleared by the Ninth Division, the 1st Yorkshire
Cyclists playing a gallant part in the former operation. The net result was
that in this part of the line all the troops had reached the Lys either on the
evening of September 15 or on the morning of September 16.</p>
<p>The advance in the south had been equally successful, though there were
patches where the resistance was very stiff. The 103rd Brigade on the left of
the Thirty-fourth Division enveloped and captured Gheluwe and were afterwards
held up by field-guns firing over open sights until they were taken by a rapid
advance of the 5th Scottish Borderers and the 8th Scottish Rifles. The 102nd
Brigade made a lodgment in the western outskirts of Menin, which was fully
occupied on the next day, patrols being at once pushed across the Lys. These
were hard put to it to hold on until they were relieved later in the day by the
Thirtieth Division. Wevelghem was cleared on the 15th, and on the 16th both the
Ninth and Thirty-sixth Divisions established bridge-heads across the river, but
in both cases were forced to withdraw them. In the north the Belgians had
reached Iseghem and Cortemarck, while the French were round Roulers. By the
night of October 15 Thourout was surrounded, and the Germans on the coast,
seeing the imminent menace to their communications, began to blow up their guns
and stores preparatory to their retreat. On October 17 the left of the Allied
line was in Ostend, and on the 20th it had extended to the Dutch border. Thus
after four years of occupation the Germans said farewell for ever to those salt
waters of the west which they had fondly imagined to be their permanent
advanced post against Great Britain. The main tentacle of the octopus had been
disengaged, and the whole huge, perilous creature was shrinking back to the
lairs from which it had emerged.</p>
<p>Events were now following each other in very rapid succession as the
pressure upon the flanks increased. On the one side it was Ostend; on the
other, as already recorded, it was Douai, which the Eighth Division had entered
on October 17. Finally, on the morning of October 18, Haking's Eleventh Corps
from Birdwood's Army held Lille in their grasp. The Fifty-seventh and
Fifty-ninth Divisions were north and south of the town, which was occupied
before evening, to the immense joy of the liberated inhabitants. Meanwhile De
Lisle's Fifteenth Corps pushed on in the north and occupied both Roubaix and
Tourcoing. There was little resistance to these operations, for the Flemish
advance on one side and that to Le Cateau on the other had made the position of
the German garrisons impossible. By October 22 the troops were on the line of
the Escaut from Valenciennes to Avelghem.</p>
<p>Though the advance of Birdwood's Army was comparatively bloodless there was
still some obstinate fighting in the north, and the divisions which forced the
Lys had by no means a holiday task. This operation was carried out on October
20 and 21, and owing to some delay on the part of the French Seventh Corps in
getting into position the flank of the Thirty-sixth Ulster Division was exposed
to enfilade fire which caused great loss. As the Ulsters advanced across the
river they had to throw back a defensive flank 6000 yards deep before evening
of the 21st. On the 22nd the Germans were still fighting stoutly, and delivered
at least one dangerous counter-attaok by storm-troops, while on the 25th they
brought a new division, the Twenty-third Reserve, an old opponent of early
Ypres days, into the line, and held their ground well. There were changes in
the British fighting line also, as the Thirty-first relieved the Twenty-ninth,
while the Thirty-fourth, coming from the south, took the place of the
Ulsters.</p>
<p>These two divisions attacked once more on October 31, the Thirty-first
surrounding Caster while the Thirty-fourth captured Anseghem, the 8th Scottish
Rifles forcing their way into the town, and joining up with the French at
Winterkan. That evening the enemy retired across the Escaut, and the line was
definitely made good. The bridges over the river had been destroyed, but the
French were advancing rapidly from the north, and on November 2 had reached
Driesen and Peterghem. They then extended south and took over the whole front
of the Second Corps, joining up with the left of the Nineteenth Corps. The
Second Corps drew out from its last battle, having since the advance began
captured 7500 prisoners and 150 guns, at a loss to itself of 11,000 casualties.
At this period the operations of the north may be said to have reached their
term.</p>
<p>The weight of the campaign never fell fully upon Birdwood's Fifth Army, but
it was comprised of divisions which had been knocked to pieces elsewhere and
which would not have been battle-worthy at all had they not been of splendid
individual material. Some of them were actually called B divisions, but upon
one of them doing thirty-three miles in thirty hours it was decreed by their
General that such an invidious title must cease. The Portuguese troops
accompanied the British in the Fifth Army. There was a good deal of discontent
in the ranks of this contingent, largely due to the fact that it was impossible
to grant the men the same privileges in the way of leave as were given to the
officers. By a great concession they were broken up, however, among the British
brigades, with the result that they did very well during the last phases of the
fighting. The fact that General Birdwood with his depleted and inexperienced
divisions was able to drive the Germans through Merville, Estaires, La
Bass&eacute;e, and on over the Aubers Ridge and out of Lille, forcing the
Scheldt and reaching as far as Ath, will always be a memorable military
exploit. It is on record that the last bag of prisoners by this Army was at
10.57 on the 11th November, three minutes before time.</p>
<p>On November 15 Marshal Foch visited the Headquarters of the Fifth Army, and
his remarks on that occasion were meant, no doubt, to apply to the whole
British line. "Your soldiers," he said, "continued to march when they were
exhausted, and they fought, and fought well, when they were worn out. It is
with such indomitable will that the war has been won. At the moment of ceasing
hostilities the enemy troops were demoralised and disorganised and their lines
of communication were in a state of chaos. Had we continued the war for another
fortnight we might have won a most wonderful and complete military victory. But
it would have been inhuman to risk the lives of one of our soldiers
unnecessarily. The Germans asked for an armistice. We renounced the certainty
of further military glory and gave it to them. I am deeply sensible of the fact
that Lille was delivered without damage to the town, and I am grateful for the
help given so generously to the inhabitants."</p>
<p>So ended the Great War in the northern sector. It need not be said that
while the British had been attacking again and again in the manner described,
taking no heed of their own losses and exhaustion so long as they could bring
the tottering giant to his knees, the French and the Americans were advancing
in unison. The work of the latter in the wooded region of the Argonne was
especially difficult and also especially vital, as its effect was to cut in
upon the German rear and to narrow the pass through which the great multitude
must make their escape from the lands which they had so wantonly invaded. On
September 12 the Americans had shown their quality by their successful attack
upon the St. Mihiel salient. In the advance of the Argonne the American attack
extended over several weeks, was often held up, and furnished more than a
hundred thousand casualties, but General Pershing and his men showed a splendid
tenacity which carried them at last through all their difficulties, so that the
end of the war, which their exertions had undoubtedly helped to hasten, found
them with their line in Sedan and biting deeply into the German flank.</p>
<p>Before entering upon the terms of the Armistice and describing the
subsequent conditions of peace, representing the final fruits of all the
terrible sacrifices of these years of alternate hope and fear, one last glance
must be cast round at the other fields of the great struggle&mdash;Italian,
Salonican, Syrian, and Mesopotamian&mdash;all of which were decided at the same
moment. It could almost be believed that some final spiritual fiat had gone
forth placing an allotted term upon the slaughter, so simultaneous was the
hostile collapse on every front. In Italy General Diaz, who had succeeded
General Cadorna after the disaster of Caporetto, made a grand and victorious
attack on October 25. It was a great military achievement, and justified those
who had always upheld the fine quality of the Italian Army. The Austrian forces
were superior in number, being roughly a million against nine hundred thousand,
but they were inferior in gun power. Diaz cleverly concentrated his forces so
as to have a local superiority in the central sector, but his difficulties were
still very great, since a stream a mile broad lay before him, shallow in parts
but deepening to five feet even at the best fords. A long island, the Grave di
Papadopoli, lay near the hostile shore, and this was seized on the night of the
24th October by the 1st Welsh Fusiliers and the 2/1st Honourable Artillery
Company, who held on in spite of a severe shelling and so established an
advanced base for the Army. Early on October 25 crossings were made at all
points, and though the bridges were frequently shot away by the Austrian guns,
and one corps was unable to get a single man across, none the less those who
had reached the other side, including Babington's Fourteenth Corps, which had
the Seventh and Twenty-third British Divisions in the line, with the
Thirty-seventh Italian Division, made exoellent headway. By the evening of
October 29 this Fourteenth Corps, which had been held up by having its left
flank exposed through the failure of the Eighth Corps to cross the river, found
a brave comrade in the Italian Eighteenth Corps which lined up with it and
crashed its way right through the Kaiserstellung position forming the battle
zone of the Austrian line. It was a very complete victory, and broadened to
such an extent during the next few days that by November 2 the whole Austrian
army had ceased to exist, and 700,000 men with 7000 guns were in the hands of
the victors. Not only had they regained by arms all the ground they had lost a
year before, but Trieste surrendered on November 3 and was occupied from the
sea. Trento had also been taken in the north, so that the two goals of Italian
ambition had both been reached. Every part of the Italian line had been equally
victorious from the Alps to the sea, and great valour was shown by every
formation, as well as by the French and British contingents. The British
Forty-eighth Division was engaged in the northern sector, far from its
comrades, and carried through its complete objective in a manner worthy of so
veteran a unit, which had learned its soldiering in the hard school of the
Somme and of Flanders. On November 3 the final Armistice was signed by the
Austrians, by which they withdrew into their own country and waited there for
the final terms of the victors.</p>
<p>On September 12 began the great Franco-Serbian advance on the Salonican
front&mdash;a front which had been greatly strengthened by the accession of the
Greek forces. Under General Franchet d'Esperey and Marshal Misitch there was an
advance on a front of sixteen miles, penetrating occasionally to a depth of
four miles. By September 17 this had extended to a depth of twelve miles, and
it was clear that a decisive movement was on foot. On September 18 the British
and Greek troops joined in on the Lake Doiran sector, and the Bulgarians were
retreating along their whole front of a hundred miles. General Milne's troops
were the first to cross the Bulgarian border, after a very severe action in
which some units sustained heavy losses. All the Allied nations were advancing
swiftly, and it was clear that the end was near. On September 30 the Bulgarian
nation, misled by its own unscrupulous ambitions and by its unsavoury king,
sent in its surrender, retired from the conflict, and waited to hear what the
final punishment of its misdeeds might be. Thus fell the first of the four
pillars of the Central Alliance.</p>
<p>The fate of Turkey was not long delayed. On September 19 General Allenby,
who had halted long upon the line of Jerusalem while he gathered his forces for
a supreme and final effort, gave the word for a fresh advance. The victory
which followed will perhaps be accounted the most completely scientific and
sweeping of the whole war. With his mixed force of British, Indians,
Australians and smaller Allied contingents, Allenby broke through the enemy's
lines near the coast, and then despatched his splendid cavalry towards Damascus
in a wild pursuit which can hardly be matched for calculated temerity. Some of
the troopers in that wonderful ride are said to have accomplished seventy to
eighty miles in the twenty-four hours. The result was that a strong force was
thrown across the Turkish rear and that their Seventh and Eighth Armies were
practically annihilated. In the final tally no less than 80,000 men and 250
guns were in the hands of the victors. It was a shattering blow. Damascus was
occupied, the Turks were driven pell-mell out of Syria, General Marshall
advanced in Mesopotamia, and Turkey was finally brought to her knees after a
battle on the Tigris in which her last army was destroyed. On October 30 she
signed an armistice by which the Allied fleets might enter the Dardanelles and
occupy Constantinople, while all Allied prisoners should at once be returned.
As in the case of the Germans the feelings with which the Allies, and
especially the British, regarded the Turks were greatly embittered by their
consistent brutality to the unfortunate captives whom the fortune of war had
placed in their hands. There can be no peace and no sense of justice in the
world until these crimes have been absolutely expiated. The last spark of
sympathy which Britain retained for her old Oriental ally was extinguished for
ever by the long-drawn murder of the prisoners of Kut. It should be added that
the small German force in East Africa still continued to dodge the pursuing
columns, and that it was intact in Rhodesia at the time when the general
collapse compelled it to lay down its arms. It was a most remarkable
achievement, this resistance of four years when cut away from a base, and
reflects great credit upon General von Lettow-Vorbeck, whose name should
certainly shine among the future reconstructors of Germany.</p>
<p>As to naval matters there is nothing to be said save that the submarine
trouble had been greatly ameliorated by the splendid work of the Navy, much
assisted by the American destroyers. The blockade was still rigorously
enforced, and had much to do with the general German collapse. There was some
hope that the German fleet would come out and that a more decisive Jutland
might adorn the finish of the war, but the plans of the German officers were
marred by the insubordination of the German men, and there was no heroic
gesture to dignify the end of the great useless fleet, the most fatal and
futile of all Germany's creations, for its possession led her to her ruin.</p>
<hr>
<br>
<h2><a id="chap12" name="chap12">XII. THE END</a></h2>
<p class="first">BEFORE entering into the terms of the Armistice it may be
instructive to give some short outline of the course of events at the German
Headquarters which led to so sudden and dramatic a collapse. No doubt the
political and economic state of Germany was very bad, but the disaster was
primarily a military one, as is clearly shown by the subsequent White Book
published after the declaration of peace. This compilation shows that the
arrogance with which the military leaders spoke during their successful
offensive, and down to the middle of July, had changed in the short space of
ten weeks to such utter despair that on October 1 they were sending urgent
messages to Berlin that the war was to be closed down at any cost, and that
even such questions as the loss of the German colonies and the cession of
Alsace-Lorraine were not to weigh in the balance against the imperative
necessity of staving off a tremendous military disaster. The inclined plane
seems to have taken an abrupt tilt on August 14, after the first successful
British advance, when it was decided to take the opportunity of the next German
success to ask for peace. No success arrived, however, but rather a long
succession of disasters, and Hertling, the dotard Chancellor, was unable to
make up his mind what to do, so that matters were allowed to drift from bad to
worse. Early in October it was announced from General Headquarters that a break
through might occur at any moment. Prince Max of Baden had been made Chancellor
on the understanding that he would at once appeal to President Wilson for a
cessation of hostilities, which was the more urgent as Bulgaria had already
dropped out of the war and Austria was on her last legs. As might have been
foreseen, President Wilson refused to treat without the concurrence of his
Allies, and some improvement in the German defensive line enabled them to hold
on until early November, when their needs once again became overpowering, and
the great twin-brethren Hindenburg and Ludendorff finally admitted defeat. Then
followed in quick succession events which are political and outside the scope
of this record&mdash;the revolution in the Fatherland, the flight of the Kaiser
and of the Crown Prince into Holland, and the advance of the Allied armies,
under the terms of the Armistice, to the left bank of the Rhine.</p>
<p>Some account should, however, be given of the circumstances under which the
Armistice was signed, and the drastic terms which were exacted by the Allies,
the fit preliminaries to a peace founded upon a stern justice. It was at nine
o'clock on the evening of Thursday, November 7, that the German delegates, led
by the ambiguous and scheming Erzberger, travelling along shell-broken roads,
under the glare of searchlights and signal-fires, entered within the French
lines near La Capelle. The roar of the battle in their rear was a constant
reminder of the urgency of their mission. They came no farther than Marshal
Foch's travelling headquarters, where they were met by the Marshal himself,
with Admiral Wemyss to represent that British sea-power which had done so much
to promote this interview. The proceedings were short and strained. A
proposition for a truce was waved aside by the victors, and a list of terms was
presented which made the German delegates realise, if they had failed to do so
before, the abyss into which their country had been precipitated by two
generations of madmen. Disgrace abroad, revolution at home, a fugitive monarch,
a splitting empire, a disbanding army, a mutinous fleet&mdash;these were the
circumstances under which Germany ended her bid for the dictatorship of the
world.</p>
<p>At 5 A.M. on Monday, November 11, the Armistice was signed, and at 11 A.M.,
as already recorded, the last shot of the greatest war that ever has been, or
in all probability ever will be, had been fired. London and Paris were at last
relieved from their terrific strain, and none who witnessed them can forget the
emotions and rejoicings of the day. Those who had not realised the complete
collapse of the Colossus were surprised at the severity of the terms which had
been accepted in such haste. All invaded territory had to be cleared within
fourteen days. All Allied prisoners to be at once returned, while those of
Germany were retained. The left bank of the Rhine, together with ample
bridge-heads, to be handed over, as a temporary measure, to the Allies, the
Belgians holding the north, the British the Cologne area, the Americans the
Coblentz area, and the French, Strasburg, with all Alsace-Lorraine. All danger
of a continuation of the struggle was averted by the immediate surrender of
5000 guns, 30,000 machine-guns, and 2000 aeroplanes, together with great
numbers of locomotives, lorries, waggons, and barges. All Roumanian, Russian,
and other forced treaties were abrogated. East Africa was to be evacuated. All
submarines and a large portion of the German navy were to be handed over to the
care of the Allies until peace terms should decide their ultimate fate. The
blockade was to continue. Such were the main points of the Armistice which
foreshadowed the rigorous peace to come.</p>
<p>It was not until January 11, 1919, that the delegates from the various
interested nations assembled in Paris, and their deliberations, which seemed
long to us, but may appear hasty and ill-considered to our descendants,
terminated on May 7, a most dramatic date, being the anniversary of that
sinking of the Lusitania which will always be recorded as the supreme instance
of German barbarity. So stringent were the terms that the Scheidemann
Government resigned and left the unpleasant task of ratification to a cabinet
of nobodies, with Herr Bauer at their head. So long as the firm signed, it
mattered nothing to the Allies which particular partner was the representative.
There was higgling and wriggling up to the last moment, and some small
concessions were actually gained. The final results were briefly as
follows:</p>
<p>1. Two new countries shall be formed&mdash;Poland in the north and
Czecho-Slovakia in the south, the former largely at the expense of Germany, the
latter of Austria. Germany shall contribute to the building up of Poland the
districts of West Prussia and Posen, both of which are historically Polish. The
important district of Upper Silesia&mdash;the prized conquest of Frederick from
Maria Theresa&mdash;was left indeterminate, its fate to be decided by the
people's will.</p>
<p>2. The northern portion of Schleswig shall revert to Denmark, from which it
was taken.</p>
<p>3. Alsace-Lorraine shall be returned to France, and that country shall
receive for a time the produce of the Saar coal-fields as recompense for the
destruction of her own coal-fields by the Germans.</p>
<p>Thus on each side, Germany was trimmed down to the lands inhabited by
Germans, the Danes, the Poles, and the French borderers being emancipated. When
next they march to war they will not swell their ranks by unwilling conscripts
forced to fight against their own friends and interests.</p>
<p>4. Every effort was made by the treaty to disarm Germany, and to prevent her
in the future from plotting the destruction of her neighbours. Those sudden
irruptions of 1864, 1866, 1870, and 1914 were to be stopped once and for
ever&mdash;if indeed we can place final terms upon a phenomenon which dates
back to the days of the Roman republic.</p>
<p>The German General Staff&mdash;that dangerous <i>imperium in
imperio</i>&mdash;was to be dissolved. The army should be only sufficiently
powerful to keep internal order and to control the frontiers. Compulsory
service was abolished, and the manhood of Germany&mdash;to the probable
detriment of all trade competitors&mdash;was dedicated to the arts of peace.
The import and export of war material were forbidden, and the great war-god,
Krupp, lay prostrate in his shrine at Essen. All submarines were forbidden. The
navy was limited to thirty-six vessels of mediocre strength. Zeppelins were to
be handed over. German cables, fourteen in number, and all German oversea
possessions passed into the hands of the Allies. With such terms, if the Allies
continue to stand together and guarantee their enforcement, the Frenchman may
look eastward without a tremor, and the mists of the North Sea can cloud no
menace for our islands. For many a long year to come the formidable military
history of Germany has reached its close. A clause which dealt with the trial
of all military offenders, including the Kaiser, concluded the more important
items of the Treaty.</p>
<p>So at last the dark cloud of war, which had seemed so endless and so
impenetrable as it covered the whole heavens from the Eastern horizon to the
Western, passed and drifted beyond us, while a dim sun in a cold sky was the
first herald of better times. Laden with debt, heart-heavy for its lost ones,
with every home shaken and every industry dislocated, its hospitals filled with
broken men, its hoarded capital all wasted upon useless engines&mdash;such was
the world which the accursed German Kultur had left behind it. Here was the
crop reaped from those navy bills and army estimates, those frantic professors
and wild journalists, those heavy-necked, sword-trailing generals, those
obsequious, arrogant courtiers, and the vain, swollen creature whom they
courted. Peace had come at last&mdash;if such a name can be given to a state
where international bitterness will long continue, and where within each
frontier the bulk of mankind, shaken by these great events from the ruts of
custom, contend fiercely for some selfish advantage out of the general chaos.
In the East, Russia, like some horrible invertebrate creature, entangles itself
with its own tentacles, and wrestles against itself with such intricate
convulsions that one can hardly say which attacks or which defends, which is
living or which already dead. But the world swings on the divine cycle. He who
made the planet from the fire-mist is still at work moulding with set and
sustained purpose the destinies of a universe which at every stage can only
reach the higher through its combat with the lower.</p>
<p>Here the historian's task is done. It has occupied and alleviated many heavy
days. Whatever its sins of omission it should surely contain some trace of the
spirit of the times, since many a chapter was written to the rumble of the
distant guns, and twice the author was able to leave his desk and then return
with such inspiration as an actual view of the battlefields could afford him.
The whole British line in 1916, the Soissons and Ardennes positions of the
French, the Carnic Alps, the Trentino, and the Isonzo positions of the Italians
were all visited in turn; while in 1918, as recorded, the crowning mercy of
September 29 was actually witnessed by the writer. He lays down his pen at last
with the deep conviction that the final results of this great convulsion are
meant to be spiritual rather, than material, and that upon an enlightened
recognition of this depends the future history of mankind. Not to change rival
frontiers, but to mould the hearts and spirits of men&mdash;there lie the
explanation and the justification of all that we have endured. The system which
left seven million dead upon the fields of Europe must be rotten to the core.
Time will elapse before the true message is mastered, but when that day arrives
the war of 1914 may be regarded as the end of the dark ages and the start of
that upward path which leads away from personal or national selfishness towards
the City Beautiful upon the distant hills.</p>

<h2><a id="app" name="app">APPENDIX</a></h2>
<p class="first">THE following account of some personal experiences on the day
when the Hindenburg Line was finally broken&mdash;the most important day,
perhaps, in the whole war&mdash;may possibly be worthy of the decent obscurity
of an appendix, though it is too slight and too personal for the pages of a
serious chronicle. It is appended for what it is worth, reprinted with a few
additions from the columns of <i>The Times</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord,<br>
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.</p>
<p>The grand, sonorous, mystical lines of Julia Ward Howe rang in my head as I
found myself by most unlooked-for chance an actual eyewitness of this, one of
the historical episodes of the greatest of wars. Yes, with my own eyes I saw
the rent while the men who made it were still pushing forward from the farther
side of it.</p>
<p>Even now I can hardly realise that it was so. A kindly invitation from the
Australian Government explains my presence on their front, while the energy and
goodwill of a helpful soldier on the spot, a captain of Australian Artillery,
brought about the rest. Let me try to transcribe what I saw. It was about 11
o'clock when we reached the edge of the battle-field on Sunday, September 29.
"We" refers to Sir Joseph Cook, Colonial statesman, Commander Latham, the
Australian Naval Attach&eacute;, and myself, with Captain Plunket, a

<p>The programme of the day was already clear in our heads. American Divisions
were to rush the front line. The Australian Divisions were to pass through
them, and carry the battle front forward. Already as we arrived the glad news
came back that the Americans had done their part, and that the Australians had
just been unleashed. Also that the Germans were standing to it like men.</p>
<p>As our car threaded the crowded street between the ruins of Templeux we met
the wounded coming back, covered cars with nothing visible save protruding
boots, and a constant stream of pedestrians, some limping, some with bandaged
arms and faces, some supported by Red Cross men, a few in pain, most of them
smiling grimly behind their cigarettes. Amid them came the first clump of
prisoners, fifty or more, pitiable enough, and yet I could not pity them, the
weary, shuffling, hang-dog creatures, with no touch of nobility in their
features or their bearing.</p>
<p>The village was full of Americans and Australians, extraordinarily like each
other in type. One could well have lingered, for it was all of great interest,
but there were even greater interests ahead, so we turned up a hill, left our
car, which had reached its limit, and proceeded on foot. The road took us
through a farm, where a British anti-aircraft battery stood ready for action.
Then we found open plain, and went forward, amid old trenches and rusty wire,
in the direction of the battle.</p>
<p>We had now passed the heavy gun positions, and were among the field-guns, so
that the noise was deafening. A British howitzer battery was hard at work, and
we stopped to chat with the major. His crews had been at it for six hours, but
were in great good-humour, and chuckled mightily when the blast of one of their
guns nearly drove in our eardrums, we having got rather too far forward. The
effect was that of a ringing box on the exposed ear&mdash;with which
valediction we left our grinning British gunners and pushed on to the east,
under a screaming canopy of our own shells. The wild, empty waste of moor was
broken by a single shallow quarry or gravel-pit, in which we could see some
movement. In it we found an advanced dressing station, with about a hundred.
American and Australian gunners and orderlies. There were dug-outs in the sides
of this flat excavation, and it had been an American battalion H.Q. up to a few
hours before. We were now about a thousand yards from the Hindenburg Line, and
I learned with emotion that this spot was the Egg Redoubt, one of those
advanced outposts of General Gough's Army which suffered so tragic and glorious
a fate in that great military epic of March 21&mdash;one of the grandest in the
whole war. The fact that we were now actually standing in the Egg Redoubt
showed me, as nothing else could have done, bow completely the ground had been
recovered, and how the day of retribution was at hand.</p>
<p>We were standing near the eastward lip of the excavation, and looking over
it, when it was first brought to our attention that it took two to make a
battle. Up to now we had seen only one. Now two shells burst in quick
succession forty yards in front of us, and a spray of earth went into the air.
"Whizz-bangs," remarked our soldier-guide casually. Personally, I felt less
keenly interested in their name than in the fact that they were there at
all.</p>
<p>We thought we had done pretty well to get within 1000 yards of the famous
line, but now came a crowning bit of good fortune, for an Australian gunner
captain, a mere lad, but a soldier from his hawk's eyes to his active feet,
volunteered to rush us forward to some coign of vantage known to himself. So it
was Eastward Ho! once more, still over a dull, barren plain sloping gently
upwards, with little sign of life. Here and there was the quick fluff of a
bursting shell, but at a comforting distance. Suddenly ahead of us a definite
object broke the sky-line. It was a Tank, upon which the crew were working with
spanners and levers, for its comrades were now far ahead, and it would fain
follow. This, it seems, was the grand stand which our young gunner had
selected. On to the top of it we clambered&mdash;and there, at our very feet
and less than 500 yards away, was the rift which had been torn a few hours
before in the Hindenburg line. On the dun slope beyond it, under our very eyes,
was even now being fought a part of that great fight where at last the children
of light were beating down into the earth the forces of darkness. It was there.
We could see it. And yet how little there was to see!</p>
<p>The ridge was passed and the ground sloped down, as dark and heathy as
Hindhead. In front of us lay a village. It was Bellicourt. The Hindenburg
position ran through it. It lay quiet enough, and with the unaided eye one
could see rusty red fields of wire in front of it. But the wire had availed
nothing, nor had the trench that lurked behind it, for beyond it, beside the
village of Nauroy, there was a long white line, clouds of pale steam-like
vapour spouting up against a dark, rain-sodden sky. "The Boche smoke barrage,"
said our guide. "They are going to counter-attack." Only this, the long, white,
swirling cloud upon the dark plain, told of the strife in front of us. With my
glasses I saw what looked like Tanks, but whether wrecked or in action I could
not say. There was the battle&mdash;the greatest of battles&mdash;but nowhere
could I see a moving figure. It is true that all the noises of the Pit seemed
to rise from that lonely landscape, but noise was always with us, go where we
would.</p>
<p>The Australians were ahead where that line of smoke marked their progress.
In the sloping fields, which at that point emerged out of the moor, the
victorious Americans, who had done their part, were crouching. It was an
assured victory upon which we gazed, achieved so rapidly that we were ourselves
standing far forward in ground which had been won that day. The wounded had
been brought in, and I saw no corpses, though some friends who had reached the
line to our left found eighteen American lads lying dead by the roadside. On
that side the fight was very severe, and the Germans, who had been hidden in
their huge dug-outs, were doing their usual trick of emerging and cutting oil
the attack. So much the gathered afterwards, but for the moment it was the
panorama before us which was engrossing all our thoughts.</p>
<p>Suddenly the German guns woke up. I can but pray that it was not our group
which drew their fire upon the half-mended Tank. Shell after shell fell in its
direction, all of them short, but creeping forward with each salvo. It was time
for us to go. If any man says that without a call of duty he likes being under
aimed shell-fire, he is not a man whose word I would trust. Some of the shells
burst with a rusty red outflame, and we were told that they were gas shells. I
may say that before we were admitted on to the battle-field at all, we were
ushered one by one into a room where some devil's pipkin was bubbling in the
corner, and were taught to use our gas-masks by the simple expedient of telling
us that if we failed to acquire the art then and there a very painful
alternative was awaiting us.</p>
<p>We made our way back, with no indecent haste, but certainly without
loitering, across the plain, the shells always getting rather nearer, until we
came to the excavation. Here we had a welcome rest, for our good gunner took us
into his cubby-hole of a dug-out, which would at least stop shrapnel, and we
shared his tea and dried beef, a true Australian soldier's meal.</p>
<p>The German fire was now rather heavy, and our expert host explained that
this meant that he had recovered from the shock of the attack, had reorganised
his guns, and was generally his merry self once more. From where we sat we
could see heavy shells bursting far to our rear, and there was a general
atmosphere of explosion all round us, which might have seemed alarming had it
not been for the general chatty afternoon-tea appearance of all these veteran
soldiers with whom it was our privilege to find ourselves. A group of
sulky-looking German prisoners sat in a corner, while a lank and freckled
Australian soldier, with his knee sticking out of a rent in his trousers was
walking about with four watches dangling from his hand, endeavouring vainly to
sell them. Far be it from me to assert that he did not bring the watches from
Sydney and choose this moment for doing a deal in them, but they were heavy old
Teutonic time-pieces, and the prisoners seemed to take a rather personal
interest in them.</p>
<p>As we started on our homeward track we came, first, upon the British battery
which seemed to be limbering up with some idea of advancing, and so lost its
chance of administering a box on our other ear. Farther still we met our
friends of the air guns, and stopped again to exchange a few impressions. They
had nothing to fire at, and seemed bored to tears, for the red, white, and blue
machines were in full command of the sky. Soon we found our motor waiting in
the lee of a ruined house, and began to thread our way back through the
wonderfully picturesque streams of men, American, Australian, British, and
German, who were strung along the road.</p>
<p>And then occurred a very horrible incident. One knew, of course, that one
could not wander about a battlefield and not find oneself sooner or later
involved in some tragedy, but we were now out of range of any but heavy guns,
and their shots were spasmodic. We had halted the car for an instant to gather
up two German helmets which Commander Latham had seen on the roadside, when
there was a very heavy burst close ahead round a curve in the village street. A
geyser of red brick-dust flew up into the air. An instant later our car rounded
the corner. None of us will forget what we saw. There was a tangle of mutilated
horses, their necks rising and sinking. Beside them a man with his hand blown
off was staggering away, the blood gushing from his upturned sleeve. He was
moving round and holding the arm raised and hanging, as a dog holds an injured
foot. Beside the horses lay a shattered man, drenched crimson from head to
foot, with two great glazed eyes looking upwards through a mask of blood. Two
comrades were at hand to help, and we could only go upon our way with the
ghastly picture stamped for ever upon our memory. The image of that dead driver
might well haunt one in one's dreams.</p>
<p>Once through Templeux and on the main road for Peronne things became less
exciting, and we drew up to see a column of 900 prisoners pass us. Each side of
the causeway was lined by Australians, with their keen, clear-cut, falcon
faces, and between lurched these heavy-jawed, beetle-browed, uncouth louts, new
caught and staring round with bewildered eyes at their debonnaire captors. I
saw none of that relief at getting out of it which I have read of; nor did I
see any signs of fear, but the prevailing impression was an ox-like stolidity
and dulness. It was a herd of beasts, not a procession of men. It was indeed
farcical to think that these uniformed bumpkins represented the great military
nation, while the gallant figures who lined the road belonged to the race which
they had despised as being unwarlike. Time and Fate between them have a pretty
sense of humour. One of them caught my eye as he passed and roared out in
guttural English, "The old Jairman is out!" It was the only word I heard them
speak. French cavalry troopers, stern, dignified, and martial, rode at either
end of the bedraggled procession.</p>
<p>They are great soldiers, these Australians. I think they would admit it
themselves, but a spectator is bound to confirm it. There is a reckless
dare-devilry, combined with a spice of cunning, which gives them a place of
their own in the Imperial ranks. They have a great advantage, too, in having a
permanent organisation, the same five divisions always in the same Corps, under
the same chief. It doubles their military value&mdash;and the same applies
equally, of course, to the Canadians. None the less, they must not undervalue
their British comrades or lose their sense of proportion. I had a chance of
addressing some 1200 of them on our return that evening, and while telling them
all that I thought of their splendid deeds, I ventured to remind them that 72
per cent of the men engaged and 76 per cent of the casualties were Englishmen
of England. But this is a description of a day's adventure on the Hindenburg
line, and my deep appreciation of the Commonwealth soldiers, of their officers,
and of their Commander, must appear elsewhere.</p>
