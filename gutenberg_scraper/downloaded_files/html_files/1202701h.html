<h3>A pamphlet published by Small, Maynard &amp; Co., Boston, 1914</h3>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>NOTE</h2>
<p class="note">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is the historian of the Boer War as well
as the creator of <i>Sherlock Holmes</i>, the skilled student of military
operations as well as the ingenious deviser of plots; he is no less an intense
patriot than a clear and logical thinker.</p>
<p class="note">Writing early in 1913 to call to the attention of his fellow-
countrymen the warning so openly given them by General von Bernhardi in his
<i>Germany And The Next War</i>, Sir Arthur took occasion to analyze the German
general's "case" against England and to answer his contentions in the light of
history and reason. His summing up of German motives and German plans is
particularly valuable to Americans in the light of after events, and
incidentally the gentle raillery with which he punctures some of Bernhardi's
statements is a delight to every one who has been entertained by Brigadier
Gerard. His novel plan for national defence is of peculiar interest to every
American who has ever crossed the English Channel, while his advice to his
Irish fellow-countrymen seems prophetic.</p>
<p class="note">And it is impressive to find a member of the Anglo-German
Society, who has never been a serious believer in the so-called German menace,
feeling so deeply the possibilities of the "philosophy" of Bernhardi as to
write, "Every one of his propositions I dispute. But that is all beside the
question. We have not to do with his argument, but with its results. These
results are that he, a man whose opinion is of weight and a member of the
ruling class in Germany, tells us frankly that Germany will attack us the
moment she sees a favorable opportunity. I repeat that we should be mad if we
did not take very serious notice of the warning."</p>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>GREAT BRITAIN AND THE NEXT WAR</h2>
<p>I am a member of the Anglo-German Society for the improvement of the
relations between the two countries, and I have never seriously believed in the
German menace. Frequently I have found myself alone in a company of educated
Englishmen in my opinion that it was non-existent&mdash;or at worst greatly
exaggerated.</p>
<p>This conclusion was formed upon two grounds. The first was, that I knew it
to be impossible that we could attack Germany save in the face of monstrous
provocation. By the conditions of our government, even if those in high places
desired to do such a thing, it was utterly impracticable, for a foreign war
could not be successfully carried on by Great Britain unless the overwhelming
majority of the people approved of it. Our foreign, like our home, politics are
governed by the vote of the proletariat. It would be impossible to wage an
aggressive war against any Power if the public were not convinced of its
justice and necessity. For this reason we could not attack Germany.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it seemed to be equally unthinkable that Germany should
attack us. One fails to see what she could possibly hope to gain by such a
proceeding. She had enemies already upon her eastern and western frontiers, and
it was surely unlikely that she would go out of her way to pick a quarrel with
the powerful British Empire. If she made war and lost it, her commerce would be
set back and her rising colonial empire would be destroyed. If she won it, it
was difficult to see when she could hope for the spoils. We could not give her
greater facilities for trade than she has already. We could not give her
habitable white colonies, for she would find it impossible to take possession
of them in the face of the opposition of the inhabitants. An indemnity she
could never force from us. Some coaling stations and possibly some tropical
colonies, of which latter she already possesses abundance were the most that
she could hope for. Would such a prize as that be worth the risk attending such
a war? To me it seemed that there could be only one answer to such a
question.</p>
<p>It still seems to me that this reasoning is solid I still think that it
would be an insane action for Germany deliberately to plan an attack upon Great
Britain. But unfortunately an attack delivered from mistaken motives is as
damaging as any other attack, and the mischief is done before the insanity of
it is realized. If I now believe puch an attack to be possible, and it may be
imminent, it is because I have been studying "Germany And The Next War," by
General von Bernhardi.</p>
<p>A book written by such a man cannot be set aside as the mere ravings of a
Pan-Germanic Anglophobe. So far as appears, he is not a Pan-German at all.
There is no allusion to that Germania <i>irredente</i> which is the dream of
the party. He is a man of note, and the first living authority in Germany upon
some matters of military science. Does he carry the same weight when he writes
of international politics and the actual use of those mighty forces which he
has helped to form? We will hope not. But when a man speaks with the highest
authority upon one subject, his voice cannot be entirely disregarded upon a
kindred one. Besides, he continually labors, and with success, to make the
reader understand that he is the direct modern disciple of that main German
line of thought which traces from Frederic through Bismarck to the present day.
He moves in circles which actually control the actions of their country in a
manner to which we have no equivalent For all these reasons, his views cannot
be lightly set aside, and should be most carefully studied by Britons. We know
that we have no wish for war, and desire only to be left alone. Unfortunately,
it takes two to make peace, even as it takes two to make a quarrel. There is a
very clear statement here that the quarrel is imminent, and that we must think
of the means, military, naval, and financial, by which we may meet it Since von
Bernhardi's book may not be accessible to every reader of this article, I will
begin by giving some idea of the situation as it appears to him, and of the
course of action which he foreshadows and recommends.</p>
<p>He begins his argument by the uncompromising statement that war is a good
thing in itself. All advance is founded upon struggle. Each nation has a right,
and indeed a duty, to use violence where its interests are concerned and there
is a tolerable hope of success. As to the obvious objection that such a
doctrine bears no possible relation to Christianity, he is not prepared to
admit the validity of the Christian ethics in international practice. In an
ingenious passage he even attempts to bring the sanction of Christianity to
support his bellicose views. He says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote">"Again, from the Christian standpoint, we arrive at the same
conclusion. Christian morality is based, indeed, on the law of love. 'Love God
above all things, and thy neighbor as thyself.' This law can claim no
significance for the relations of one country to another, since its application
to politics would lead to a conflict of duties. The love which a man showed to
another country as such would imply a want of love for his own countrymen. Such
a system of politics must inevitably lead men astray. Christian morality is
personal and social, and in its nature cannot be political. Its object is to
promote morality of the individual, in order to strengthen him to work
unselfishly in the interests of the community. It tells us to love our
individual enemies, but does not remove the conception of enmity."</p>
<p>Having thus established the general thesis that a nation should not hesitate
to declare war where a material advantage may be the reward, he sets out very
clearly what are some of the causes for war which Germany can see before her.
The following passages throw a light upon them:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote">"Strong, healthy and flourishing nations increase in numbers.
From a given moment they require a continual expansion of their frontiers, they
require new territory for the accommodation of their surplus population. Since
almost every part of the globe is inhabited, new territory must, as a rule, be
obtained at the cost of its possessors &mdash;that is to say, by conquest,
which thus becomes a law of necessity."</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote">"Lastly, in all times the right of conquest by war has been
admitted. It may be that a growing people cannot win colonies from uncivilized
races, and yet the State wishes to retain the surplus population which the
mother country can no longer feed. Then the only course left is to acquire the
necessary territory hy war. Thus the instinct of self-preservation leads
inevitably to war, and the conquest of foreign soil. It is not the possessor,
but the victor, who then has the right"</p>
<p>And he concludes:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote">"Arbitration must be peculiarly detrimental to an aspiring
people, which has not yet reached its political and national zenith, and is
bent on expanding its power in order to play its part nonorably in the
civilized world."</p>
<p>And adds:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote">"It must be borne in mind that a peaceful decision by an
arbitration court can never replace in its effects and consequences a warlike
decision, even as regards the State in whose favor it is pronounced."</p>
<p>To many of us it would seem a legitimate extension of the author's argument
if we said that it would have a virile and bracing effect upon our characters
if, when we had a grievance against our neighbor, we refrained from taking it
into the law courts, but contented ourselves with breaking his head with a
club. However, we are concerned here not so much witii the validity of the
German general's arguments as with their practical application so far as they
affect ourselves.</p>
<p>Brushing aside the peace advocates, the writer continues: "To such views,
the offspring of a false humanity, the clear and definite answer must be made
that, under certain circumstances, it is not only the rights but the moral and
political duty of the statesman to bring about a war. The acts of the State
cannot be judged by the standard of individual morality." He quotes Treitschke:
"The Christian duty of sacrifice for something higher does not exist for the
State, for there is nothing higher than it in the world's
history&mdash;consequently it cannot sacrifice itself to something higher." One
would have hoped that a noble ideal and a moral purpose were something higher
but it would be vain to claim that any country, ourselves included, has ever
yet lived fully up to the doctrine. And yet some conscious striving, however
imperfect, is surely better than such a deliberate negation.</p>
<p>Having laid down these general propositions of the value of war, and of the
non-existence of international moral obligations. General von Bernhardi then
proceeds to consider very fully the general position of Germany and the
practical application of those doctrines. Within the limits of this article I
can only give a general survey of the situation as seen by him. War is
necessary for Germany, It should be waged as soon as is feasible, as certain
factors in the situation tell in favor of her enemies. The chief of these
factors are the reconstruction of the Russian fleet, which will be accomplished
within a few years, and the preparation of a French native colonial force,
which would be available for European hostilities. This also, though already
undertaken, will take some years to perfect Therefore, the immediate future is
Germany's best opportunity.</p>
<p>In this war Germany places small confidence in Italy as an ally, since her
interests are largely divergent, but she assumes complete solidarity with
Austria. Austria and Germany have to reckon with France and Russia. Russia is
slow in her movements, and Germany with her rapid mobilization, should be able
to throw herself upon France without fear of her rear. Should she win a
brilliant victory at the outset, Russia might refuse to compromise herself at
all, especially if the quarrel could be so arranged that it would seem as if
France had been the aggressor. Before the slow Slavonic mind had quite
understood the situation and set her unwieldy strength in motion, her ally
might be struck down, and she face to face with the two Germanic Powers, which
would be more than a match for her.</p>
<p>Of the German army, which is to be the instrument of this world-drama.
General von Bernhardi expresses the highest opinion : "The spirit which
animates the troops, the ardor of attack, the heroism, the loyalty which
prevail among them, justify the highest expectations. I am certain that if they
are soon to be summoned to arms their exploits will astonish the world,
provided only that they are led with skill and determination." How their "ardor
of attack" has been tested it is difficult to see, but the world will probably
agree that the German army is a most formidable force. When he goes on,
however, to express the opinion that they would certainly overcome the French,
the two armies being approximately of the same strength, it is not so easy to
follow his argiunent. It is possible that even so high an authority as General
von Bernhardi has not entirely appreciated how Germany has been the teacher of
the world in military matters and how thoroughly her pupils have responded to
that teaching. That attention to detail, perfection of arrangement for
mobilization and careful preparation which have won German victories in the
past may now be turned against her, and she may find that others can equal her
in herownvirtues.</p>
<p>Poor France, once conquered, is to be very harshly treated. Here is the
passage which describes her fate:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote">"In one way or another we must square our account with France
if we wish for a free hand in our international policy. This is the first and
foremost condition of a sound German policv, and since the hostility of France
once for all cannot be removed by peaceful overtures, the matter must be
settled by force of arms. France must be so completely crushed that she can
never again come across our path."</p>
<p>It is not said how Germany could permanently extinguish France, and it is
difficult to think it out. An indemnity, however large, would eventually be
paid and France recover herself. Germany has found the half-German border
provinces Nvhich she annexed so indigestible that she could hardly incorporate
Champagne or any other purely French district. Italy might absorb some of Savoy
and the French Riviera. If the country were artificially separated the various
parts would fly together again at the first opportunity. Altogether the
permanent sterilization of France would be no easy matter to effect. It would
probably be attempted by imposing the condition that in future no army, save
for police duties, would be allowed. The history of Prussia itself, however,
shows that even so stringent a prohibition as this can be evaded by a conquered
but indomitable people.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to General von Bernhardi's views upon ourselves, and, first
of all, it is of interest to many of us to know what are those historical
episodes which have caused him and many of his fellow-countrymen to take bitter
exception to our national record. From our point of view we have repeatedly
helped Germany in the past, and have asked for and received no other reward
than the consciousness of having co-operated in some common cause. So it was in
Marlborough's days. So in the days of Frederic. So also in those of Napoleon.
To all these ties, which had seemed to us to be of importance, there is not a
single allusion in this volume. On the other hand, there are very bitter
references to some other historical events which must seem to us strangely
inadequate as a cause for international hatred.</p>
<p>We may, indeed, congratulate ourselves as a nation, if no stronger
indictment can be made against us than is contained in the book of the German
general. The first episode upon which he animadverts is the ancient German
grievance of the abandonment of Frederic the Great by England in the year 1761.
One would have thought that there was some statute of limitatiohs in such
matters, but apparently there is none in the German mind. Let us grant that the
premature cessation of a campaign is an injustice to one's associates, and let
us admit also that a British Government under its party system can never be an
absolutely stable ally. Having said so much, one may point out that there were
several mitigating circumstances in this affair. We had fought for five years,
granting considerable subsidies to Frederic during that time, and despatching
British armies into the heart of Germany. The strain was very great, in a
quarrel which did not vitally affect ourselves. The British nation had taken
the view, not wholly unreasonably, that the war was being Waged in the
interests of Hanover, and upon a German rather than a British quarrel. When we
stood out France did the same, so that the balance of power between the
combatants was not greatly affected. Also, it may be pointed out as a curious
historical fact that this treatment which he so much resented was exactly that
which Frederic had himself accorded to his allies some years before at the
close of the Silesian campaign. On that occasion he made an isolated peace with
Maria Theresa, and left his associates, France and Bavaria, to meet the full
force of the Austrian attack.</p>
<p>Finally, the whole episode has to be judged by the words of a modern writer:
"Conditions may arise which are more powerful than the most honorable
intentions. The country's own interests&mdash;considered, of course, in the
highest ethical sense &mdash;must then turn the scale." These sentences are not
from the work of a British apologist, but from this very book of von
Bernhardi's which scolds England for her supposed adherence to such principles.
He also quotes, with approval, Treitschke's words: "Frederic the Great was all
his life long charged with treachery because no treaty or alliance could ever
induce him to renounce the right of free self-determination."</p>
<p>Setting aside this ancient grievance of the Seven Years' War, it is of
interest to endeavor to find out whether there are any other solid grounds in
the past for Germany's reprobation. Two more historical instances are held up
as examples of our perfidy. The first is the bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807,
when the British took forcible possession in time of peace of the Danish fieet.
It must be admitted that the step was an extreme one, and only to be justified
upon the plea of absolute necessity for vital national reasons. The British
Government of the day believed that Napoleon was about to possess himself of
the Danish fleet and would use it against themselves. Fouche has admitted in
his Memoirs that the right was indeed given by a secret clause in the Treaty of
Tilsit. It was a desperate time, when the strongest measures were continually
being used against us, and it may be urged that similar measures were necessary
in self-defence. Having once embarked upon the enterprise, and our demand being
refused, there was no alternative but a bombardment of the city with its
attendant loss of civilian life. It is not an exploit of which we need be
proud, and at the best can only be described as a most painful and unfortunate
necessity, but I should be surprised if the Danes, on looking back to it, judge
it more harshly than some more recent experiences which they have had at the
hands of General von Bernhardi's own fellow-countrymen. That he is himself
prepared to launch upon a similar enterprise in a much larger and more
questionable shape is shown by his declaration that if Holland will not take
sides against England in the next war it should be overrun by the German
troops.</p>
<p>General von Bernhardi's next historical charge is the bombardment of
Alexandria in 1882, which he describes as having been effected upon
hypocritical pretences in a season of peace. To those who have a recollection
of that event and can recall the anti-European movement of Arabia and the
massacre which preceded the bombardment, the charge will appear grotesque. But
it is with a patchwork quilt of this sort that this German publicist endeavors
to cover the unreasoning, but hone the less formidable, jealousy and prejudice
which inflame him against this country. The foolish fiction that the British
Government declared war against the Boers in order to gain possession of their
gold mines is again brought forward, though one would have imagined that even
the gutter-Press who exploited it twelve years ago had abandoned it by now. If
General von Bernhardi can explain how the British Government is the richer for
these mines, or whether a single foreign^ shareholder has been dispossessed of
^t&amp; stock in them, he will be the first who has ever given a solid fact in
favor of this ridiculous charge. In a previous paragraph of his book he
declares that it was President Kruger who made the war, and that he was
praiseworthy for so doing. Both statements cannot be true. If it was President
Kruger who made the war, then it was not forced on by Great Britain in order to
possess herself of the gold fields.</p>
<p>So much for the specific allegations against Great Britain. One can hardly
regard them as being so serious as to wipe out the various claims, racial,
religious and historical, which unite the two countries. However, we are only
concerned with General von Bernhardi's conclusions, since he declares that his
country is prepared to act upon them. There remain two general grounds upon
which he considers that Germany should make war upon the British Empire. The
first is to act as the champion of the human race in winning what he calls the
freedom of the seas. The second is to further German expansion as a world
Power, which is cramped by our opposition.</p>
<p>The first of these reasons is difficult to appreciate. British maritime
power has been used to insure, not to destroy, the freedom of the seas. What
smallest Power has ever been hindered in her legitimate business? It is only
the pirate, the slaver and the gun-runner who can justly utter such a reproach.
If the mere fact of having predominant latent strength upon the water is an
encroachment upon the freedom of the sea, then some nation must always be
guilty of it. After our mild supremacy we may well say to Germany, as Charles
said to James: "No one will assassinate me in order to put you upon the
throne." Her mandate is unendorsed by those whom she claims to represent.</p>
<p>But the second indictment is more formidable. We lie athwart Germany's world
ambitions, even as, geographically, we lie across her outlets. But when closely
looked at, what is it of which we deprive her, and is its attainment really a
matter of such vital importances. Do we hamper her trade? On the contrary, we
exhibit a generosity which meets with no acknowledgment, and which many of us
have long held to be altogether excessive. Her manufactured goods are welcomed
in without a tax, while ours are held out from Germany by a twenty per cent
tariff. In India, Egypt and every colony which does not directly control its
own financial policy, German goods come in upon the same footing as our own. No
successful war can improve her position in this respect. There is, however, the
question of colonial expansion. General von Bernhardi foresees that Germany is
increasing her population at such a pace that emigration will be needed soon in
order to relieve it It is a perfectly natural national ambition that this
emigration should be to some place where the settlers need not lose their flag
or nationality. But if Great Britain were out of the way, where would they find
such a place? Not in Canada, Australia, South Africa, or New Zealand. These
States could not be conquered if the 'Motherland had ceased to exist General
von Bernhardi talks of the high lands of Africa, but already Germany possesses
high lands in Af rica, and their colonization has not been a success. Can
anyone name one single place upon the earth's surface suitable for white
habitation from which Germany is excluded by the existence of Great Britain? It
is true that the huge continent of South America is only sparsely inhabited,
its whole population being aboijt equal to that of Prussia. But that is an
affair in which the United States, and not we, are primarily interested, and
one which it is not our interest either to oppose or to support</p>
<p>But, however inadequate all these reasons for war may seem to a Briton, one
has still to remember that we have to reckon with the conclusions exactly as if
they were drawn from the most logical premises. These conclusions appear in
such sentences as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote">"What we now wish to attain must be fought for and won against
a superior force of hostile interests and Powers."</p>
<p class="quote">"Since the struggle is necessary and inevitable, we must fight
it out, cost what it may."</p>
<p class="quote">"A pacific agreement with England is a will-o'-the-wisp, which
no serious German statesman would trouble to follow. We must always keep the
possibility of war with England before our eyes and arrange our political and
military plans accordingly. We need not concern ourselves with any pacific
protestations of English politicians, publicists and Utopians, which cannot
alter the real basis of affairs."</p>
<p class="quote">"The situation in the world generally shows there can only be
a short respite before we once more face the question whether we will draw the
sword for our position in the world or renounce such position once for all. We
must not in any case wait until our opponents have completed their arming and
decide that the hour of attack has come."</p>
<p class="quote">"Even English attempts at a <i>rapprochement</i> must not
blind us to the real situation. We may at most use them to delay the necessary
and inevitable war until we may fairly imagine we have some prospect of
success."</p>
<p>This last sentence must come home to some of us who have worked in the past
for a better feeling between the two countries.</p>
<p>And this is the man who dares to accuse us of national perfidy.</p>
<p>These extracts are but a few from a long series which show beyond all manner
of doubt that Germany, so far as General von Bernhardi is an exponent of her
intentions, will undoubtedly attack us suddenly should she see an opportunity.
The first intimation of such an attack would, as he indicates, be a torpedo
descent upon our Fleet, and a wireless message to German liners which would
bring up their concealed guns, and turn each of them into a fast cruiser ready
to prey upon our commerce. That is the situation as he depicts it It may be
that he mistakes it. But for what it is worth, that is his opinion and
advice.</p>
<p>He sketches out the general lines of a war between England and Germany. If
France is involved, she is to be annihilated, as already described. But suppose
the two rivals are left face to face. Holland and Denmark are to be bound over
to the German side under pain of conquest. The German Fleet is to be held back
under the protection of the land forts. Meanwhile, torpedoes, submarines and
airships are to be used for the gradual whittling down of the blockading
squadrons. When they have been sufficiently weakened, the Fleet is to sally out
and the day has arrived. As to the chances of success, he is of opinion that in
material and personnel the two fleets may be taken as being equal &mdash;^when
once the numbers have been equalized. In quality of guns, he considers that the
Germans have the advantage. Of gunnery he does not speak, but he believes that
in torpedo work his countrymen are ahead of any others. In airships, which for
reconnaissance, if not for actual fightii^g power, will be of supreme
importance, he considers also that his country will have a considerable
advantage.</p>
<p>Such, in condensed form, is the general thesis and forecast of this famous
German officer. If it be true, there are evil days coming both for his country
and for ours. One may find some consolation in the discovery that wherever he
attempts to fathom our feelings he makes the most lamentable blunders. He lays
it down as an axiom, for example, that if we were hard- pressed the Colonies
would take the opportunity of abandoning us. We know, on the other hand, that
it is just such a situation which would bring about the federation of the
Empire. He is under the delusion also that there is deep commercial and
political jealousy of the United States in this country, and that this might
very well culminate in war. We are aware that there is no such feeling, and
that next to holding the trident ourselves we should wish to see it in the
hands of our American cousins. One thing he says, however, which is supremely
true, which all of us would endorse, and which every German should ponder: it
is that the idea of a war between Germany and ourselves never entered into the
thoughts of anyone in this country until the year 1902. Why this particular
year? Had the feeling risen from commercial jealousy upon the part of Great
Britain it must have shown itself far earlier than that &mdash;as early as the
"Made in Germany" enactment. It appeared in 1902 because that was the close of
the Boer War, and because the bitter hostility shown by the Germans in that war
open- ^ ed our eyes to the fact that they would do us a mischief if they could.
When the German Navy Act of 1900 gave promise that they would soon have the
means of doing so, the first thoughts of danger arose, and German policy drove
us more and more into the ranks of their opponents. Here, then, General von
Bernhardi is right; but in nearly every other reference to our feelings and
views he is wrong; so that it is to be hftped that in those matters in which we
are unable to check him, such as the course of German thought and of German
action in the future, he is equally mistaken. But I repeat that he is a man of
standing and reputation, and that we should be mad if we did not take most
serious notice of the opinions which he has laid down.</p>
<p>I have headed this article "Great Britain and the Next War'' since it looks
at the arguments and problems which General von Bernhardi has raised in his
"Germany and the Next War" from the British point of view. May it prove that
the title is an absurdity and the war an imaginative hypothesis. But I should
wish, before I close, to devote a few pages to my view upon the defensive
measures of our country. I am well aware that I speak with no expert authority,
which makes it the more embarrassing that my opinions do not coincide with
those of anyone whom J have encountered in this controversy. Still, it is
better to be a voice, however small, than an echo.</p>
<p>It would simplify the argument if we began by eliminating certain factors
which, in my opinion, simply darken counsel, as they are continually brought
out into the front of the question to the exclusion of the real issues which
lie behind them. One of them is the supposed possibility of an
invasion&mdash;either on a large scale or in the form of a raid. The former has
been pronounced by our highest naval authorities of the time as being
impossible, and I do not think anyone can read the Wilson Memorandum without
being convinced by its condensed logic Von Bernhardi, in his chapter upon the
possible methods of injuring Great Britain, though he treats the whole subject
with the greatest frankness, dismisses the idea either of raid or invasion in a
few short sentences. The raid seems to me the less tenable hypothesis of the
two. An invasion would, at least, play for a final stake, though at a deadly
risk. A raid would be a certain loss of a body of tijoops, which would
necessarily be the flower of the army; it could hope to bring about no possible
permanent effect upon the war, and it would upset the balance of military power
between Germany and her neighbors. If Germany were an island, like ourselves,
she might risk such a venture. Sandwiched in between two armed nations as
strong as herself , I do not believe that there is the slightest possibility of
it But if, as von Bernhardi says, such plans are visionary, what is the exact
object of a Territorial Army, and, even more, what would be the object of a
National Service Army upon compulsory lines for home defence? Is it not a waste
of money and energy which might be more profitably employed in some other form?
Everyone has such an affection and esteem for Lord Roberts &mdash;especiafly if
one has the honor of his personal acquaintance&mdash;that one shrinks from
expressing a view which might be unwelcome to him. And yet he would be the
first to admit that it is one's duty to add one's opinion to the debate, if
that opinion has been conscientiously formed, and if one honestly believes that
it recommends the best course of action for one's country. So far as his
argument for universal service is based upon national health and physique, I
think he is on ground which no one could attack. But I cannot bring myself to
believe that a case has been made out for the substitution of an enforced
soldier in the place of the volunteer who has always done so splendidly in the
past Great as is Lord Roberts' experience, he is talking here of a thing which
is outside it, for he has never seen an enforced British soldier, and has,
therefore, no data by which he can tell how such a man would compare with the
present article. There were enforced British sailors once, and I have seen
figures quoted to show that of 29,000 who were impressed 27,000 escaped from
the Fleet by desertion. It is not such men as these who win our battles. The
argument for enforced service is based upon the plea that the Territorial Army
is below strength in numbers and deficient in quality. But if invasion is
excluded from our calculations this is of less importance. The force becomes a
nursery for the Army, which has other reserves to draw upon before it reaches
it Experience has shown that under warlike excitement in a virile nation like
ours, the ranks soon fill up, and as the force becomes embodied from the
outbreak of hostilities, it would rapidly improve in quality. It is idle to
assert that because Bulgaria can, in a day, fiood her troops into Turkey,
therefore we should always stand to arms. The Turko- Bulgarian frontier is a
line of poste&mdash;the Anglo-German is a hundred leagues of salt water.</p>
<p>But I am such an optimist as to say that there is no danger of a German war?
On the contrary, I consider that there is a vast danger, that it is one which
we ignore, and against which we could at a small cost effect a complete
insurance. Let me try to define both the danger and the remedy. In order to do
this we must consider the two different forms which such a war might take. It
might be a single duel, or it might be with France as our ally. If Germany
attacked Great Britain alone, it may safely be prophesied that the war would be
long, tedious, and possibly inconclusive, but our role would be a comparatively
passive one. ^ If she attacked France, however, that role would be much more
active, since we could not let France go down, and to give her effective help
we must land an expeditionary force upon the Continent. This force has to be
supplied with munitions of war and kept up to strength, and so the whole
problem becomes a more complex one.</p>
<p>The element of danger, which is serious in either form of war, but more
serious in the latter, is the existence of new forms of naval warfare which
have never been tested in the hands of competent men, and which may completely
revolutionize the conditions. These new factors are the submarine and the
airship. The latter, save as a means of acquiring information, does not seem to
be formidable &mdash;or not sufficiently formidable to alter the whole
conditions of a campaign. But it is different with the submarines. No blockade,
so far as I can see, can hold these vessels in harbor, and no skill or bravery
can counteract their attack when once they are within striking distance. One
could imagine a state of things when it might be found impossible for the
greater ships on either side to keep the seas on account of these poisonous
craft No one can say beyond question that such a contingency is impossible. Let
us see, then, how it would affect us if it should ever come to pass.</p>
<p>In the first place, it would not affect us at all as regards invasion or
raids. If the German submarines can dominate our own large ships, our submarine
can do the same for theirs. We should still hold the seas with our small craft
Therefore, if Great Britain alone be at war with Germany, such a naval
revolution would merely affect our commerce and food supply. What exact effect
a swarm of submarines, lying off the mouth of the Channel and the Irish Sea,
would produce upon the victualling of these islands is a problem which is
beyond my conjecture. Other ships besides the British would be likely to be
destroyed, and international complications would probably follow. I cannot
imagine that such a fleet would entirely, or even to a very large extent, cut
off our supplies. But it is certain that they would have the effect of
considerably raising the price of whatever did reach us. Therefore, we should
suffer privation, though not necessarily such privation as would compel us to
make terms. From the beginning of the war, every home source would naturally be
encouraged, and it is possible that before our external supplies were seriously
decreased, our internal ones might be well on the way to make up the
deficiency. Both of the two great protagonists &mdash;Lord Haldane and Lord
Roberts&mdash; have declared that if we lost the command of the seas we should
have to make peace. Their reference, however, was to complete naval defeat and
not to such a condition of stalemate as seems to be the more possible
alternative. As to complete naval defeat, our estimates, and the grand loyalty
of the Overseas Dominions, seem to be amply adequate to guard against that. It
is useless to try to alarm us by counting in the whole force of the Triple
Alliance as our possible foes, for if they came into the war, the forces of our
own allies would also be available. We need think only of Germany. A
predominance of the submarine would, then, merely involve a period of hard
times in this country, if we were fighting Germany single-handed. But if we
were in alliance with France, it becomes an infinitely more important matter. I
presume that I need not argue the point that it is our vital interest that
France be not dismembered and sterilized. Such a tragedy would turn the western
half of Europe into a gigantic Germany with a few insignificant States
crouching about her feet. The period of her world dominance would then indeed
have arrived. Therefore, if France be wantonly attacked, we must strain every
nerve to prevent her going down, and among the measures to that end will be the
sending of a British expeditionary force to cover the left or Belgian wing of
the French defenses. Such a force would be cbnveyed across the Channel in
perhaps a hundred troopships, and would entail a constant service of transports
afterwards to carry its requirements.</p>
<p>Here lies, as it seems to me, the possible material for a great national
disaster. Such a fleet of transports cannot be rushed suddenly across. Its
preparation and port of departure are known. A single submarine amid such a
fleet would be like a fox in a poultry yard, destroying victim after victim.
The possibilities are appalling, for it might be not one submarine, but a
squadron. The terrified transports would scatter over the ocean to find safety
in any port. Their convoy could do little to help them. It would be a
<i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i>&mdash;an inversion of the Spanish Armada.</p>
<p>If the crossing were direct from the eastern ports to Antwerp, the danger
would become greater. It is less if it should be from Portsmouth to Havre. But
this a transit of seven hours, and the railways from Havre to the Belgian
frontier would be insufficient for such a force. No doubt the Straits of Dover
would be strongly patrolled by our own torpedo craft, and the crossing would,
so far as possible, be made at night, when submarines have their minimum of
efficiency; but, none the less, it seems to me that the risk would be a very
real and pressing one. What possible patrol could make sure of heading off a
squadron of submarines? I should imagine it to be as difficult as to bar the
Straits to a school of whales.</p>
<p>But supposing such a wholesale tragedy were avoided, and that in spite of
the predominance of submarines the army got safely to France or to Belgium, how
are we to ensure the safe passage of the long stream of ships which, for many
months, would be employed in carrying the needful supplies? We could not do it.
The army might very well find itself utterly isolated, with its line of
communications completely broken down, at a time when the demand upon the
resources of all Continental countries was so great that there was no surplus
for our use. Such a state of affairs seems to me to be a perfectly possible
one, and to form, with the chance of a disaster to the transports, the greatest
danger to which we should be exposed in a German war. But these dangers and the
food question, which has already been treated, can all be absolutely provided
against in a manner which is not only effective, but which will be of equal
value in peace and in war. The Channel Tunnel is essential to Great Britain's
safety.</p>
<p>I will not dwell here upon the commercial or financial advantages of such a
tunnel. Where the trade of two great nations concentrates upon one narrow tube,
it is obvious that whatever corporation controls that tube has a valuable
investment if the costs of construction have not been prohibitive. These costs
have been placed as low as five million pounds by Mr. Rose Smith, who
represents a practical company engaged in such work. If it were twice, thrice,
or four times that sum it should be an undertaking which should promise great
profits, and for that reason should be constructed by the nation, or nations,
for their common national advantage. It is too vital a thing for any private
company to control.</p>
<p>But consider its bearings upon a German war. All the dangers which I have
depicted are eliminated. We tap (via Marseilles and the tunnel) the whole food
supply of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Our expeditionary force makes
its transit, and has its supplies independent of weather or naval chances.
Should anything so unlikely as a raid occur, and the forces in the country seem
unable to cope with it, a Franco-British reinforcement can be rushed through
from the Continent. The Germans have made great works like the Kiel Canal in
anticipation of war. Our answer must be the Channel Tunnel, linking us closer
to our ally.</p>
<p>Though this scheme was discarded (under very differest naval and political
conditions) some twenty years ago, no time has, as a matter of fact, been lost
by the delay; as I am informed that machinery for boring purposes has so
enormously improved that what would have taken thirty years to accomplish can
now be done in three. If this estimate be correct, there may still be time to
effect this essential insurance before the war with which General von Bernhardi
threatens us breaks upon us.</p>
<p>Let us, before leaving the subject, glance briefly at the objections which
have formerly been urged against the tunnel. Such as they are, they are as
valid now as ever, although the advantages have increased to such an extent as
to throw the whole weight of the argument upon the side of those who favor its
construction. The main (indeed, the only) objection was the fear that the
tunnel would fall into wrong hands and be used for purposes of invasion. By
this was meant not a direct invasion through the tunnel itself&mdash;to invade
a nation of forty-five million people through a hole in the ground twenty-five
miles long would stagger the boldest mind&mdash;but that the tunnel might be
seized at each end by some foreign nation, which would then use it for
aggressive military purposes.</p>
<p>At the time of the discussion our relations with France were by no means so
friendly as they are now, and it was naturally to France only that we alluded,
since they would already hold one end of the tunnel We need not now discuss any
other nation, since any other would have to seize both ends by surprise, and
afterwards retain them, which is surely inconceivable. We are now bound in
close ties of friendship and mutual interest to France. We have no right to
assume that we shall always remain on as close a footing, but as our common
peril seems likely to be a permanent one, it is improbable that there will be
any speedy or sudden change in our relations. At the same time, in a matter so
vital as our hold upon the Dover end of the tunnel, we could not be too
stringent in our precautions. The tunnel should open out a point where guns
command it, the mouth of it should be within the lines of an entrenched camp,
and a considerable garrison should be kept permanently within call. The latter
condition already exists in Dover, but the numbers ' might well be increased.
As an additional precaution, a passage should be driven alongside the tunnel,
from which it could, if necessary, be destroyed. This passage should have an
independent opening within the circle of a separate fort, so that the capture
of the end of the tunnel would not prevent its destruction. 'With such
precautions as these, the most nervous might feel that our insular position had
not really been interfered with. The strong fortress of Sie Middle Ages had a
passage under the moat as part of the defence. This is our passage.</p>
<p>Could an enemy in any way destroy it in time of war?</p>
<p>It would, as I conceive it, be sunk to a depth of not less than two hundred
feet below the bed of the ocean. This ceiling would be composed of chalk and
clay. No explosive form above could drive it in. If it were designed on a large
scale&mdash;and, personally, I think it should be a four-line tunnel, even if
the cost were doubled thereby&mdash;no internal explosion, such as might be
brought about by secreting explosive packets upon the trains, would be likely
to do more than temporarily obstruct it. If the very worst happened, and it
were actually destroyed, we should be no worse off than we are now. As to the
expense, if we are driven into a war of this magnitude, a few millions one way
or the other will not be worth considering.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it may be noted that General von Bernhardi has a poor opinion
of our troops. This need not trouble us. We are what we are, and words will not
alter it. From very early days our soldiers have left their mark upon
Continental warfare, and we have no reason to think that we have declined from
the manhood of our forefathers. He further calls them "mercenaries," which is a
misuse of terms. A mercenary is a man who is paid to fight in a quarrel which
is not his own. As every British soldier must by law be a British citizen, the
term is absurd What he really means is that they are not conscripts in the
sense of being forced to fight, but that they are sufficiently well paid to
enable the army as a profession to attract a sufficient number of our young men
to the colors.</p>
<p>Our military and naval preparations are, as it seems to me, adequate for the
threatened crisis. With the Channel Tunnel added our position should be secure.
But there are other preparations which should be made for such a contest,
should it unhappily be forced upon us. One is financial. Again, as so often
before in the history of British wars, it may prove that the last guinea wins.
Everything possible should be done to strengthen British credit. This crisis
cannot last indefinitely. The cloud will dissolve or burst. Therefore, for a
time we should husband our resources for the supreme need. At such a time all
national expenditure upon objects which only mature in the future becomes
unjustifiable. Such a tax as the undeveloped land tax, which may bring in a
gain some day, but at present costs ten times what it produces, is the type of
expenditure I mean. I say nothing of its justice or injustice, but only of its
inopportuneness at a moment when we sorely need our present resources.</p>
<p>Another preparation lies in our national understanding of the possibility of
such a danger and the determination to face the facts. Both Unionists and
Liberals have shown their appreciation of the situation, and so have two of the
most famous Socialist leaders. No audible acquiescence has come from the ranks
of the Labor Party. I would venture to say one word here to my Irish fellow-
countrymen of all political persuasions. If they imagine that they can stand
politically or economically while Britain falls, they are woefully mistaken.
The British Fleet is their one shield. If it be broken, Ireland will go down.
They may well throw themselves heartily into the common defence, for no sword
can transfix England without the point reaching Ireland behind her.</p>
<p>Let me say in conclusion, most emphatically, that I do not myself accept any
of those axioms of General von Bernhardi which are the foundation-stones of his
argument I do not think that war is in itself a good thing, though a
dishonorable peace may be a worse one. I do not believe that an Anglo-German
war is necessary. I am convinced that we should never, of our own accord,
attack Germany, nor would we assist France if she made an unprovoked attack
upon that Power. I do not think that as the result of such a war, Germany could
in any way extend her flag so as to cover a larger white population. Every one
of his propositions I dispute. But that is all beside the question. We have not
to do with his argument, but with its results. Those results are that he, a man
whose opinion is of weight and a member of the ruling class in Germany, tells
us frankly that Germany will attack us the moment she sees a favorable
opportunity. I repeat that we should be mad if we did not take very serious
notice of the warning.</p>
