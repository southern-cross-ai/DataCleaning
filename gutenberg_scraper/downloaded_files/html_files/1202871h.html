  <h2>I. INTRODUCING MR. PETER RUFF<br>
  <small>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Oct
  1909</small></h2>

  <p class="first">There was nothing about the supper party on that particular
  Sunday evening in November at Daisy Villa, Green Street, Streatham, which
  seemed to indicate in any way that one of the most interesting careers
  connected with the world history of crime was to owe its very existence to
  the disaster which befell that little gathering. The villa was the residence
  and also&mdash;to his credit&mdash;the unmortgaged property of Mr. David
  Barnes, a struggling but fairly prosperous coal merchant of excellent
  character, some means, and Methodist proclivities. His habit of sitting
  without his coat when carving, although deprecated by his wife and daughter
  on account of the genteel aspirations of the latter, was a not unusual one in
  the neighbourhood; and coupled with the proximity of a cold joint of beef,
  his seat at the head of the table, and a carving knife and fork grasped in
  his hands, established clearly the fact of his position in the household,
  which a somewhat weak physiognomy might otherwise have led the casual
  observer to doubt. Opposite him, at the other end of the table, sat his wife,
  Mrs. Barnes, a somewhat voluminous lady with a high colour, a black satin
  frock, and many ornaments. On her left the son of the house, eighteen years
  old, of moderate stature, somewhat pimply, with the fashion of the moment
  reflected in his pink tie with white spots, drawn through a gold ring, and
  curving outwards to seek obscurity underneath a dazzling waistcoat. A white
  tube-rose in his buttonhole might have been intended as a sort of compliment
  to the occasion, or an indication of his intention to take a walk after
  supper in the fashionable purlieus of the neighbourhood. Facing him sat his
  sister&mdash;a fluffy-haired, blue-eyed young lady, pretty in her way, but
  chiefly noticeable for a peculiar sort of self-consciousness blended with
  self-satisfaction, and possessed only at a certain period in their lives by
  young ladies of her age. It was almost the air of the cat in whose interior
  reposes the missing canary, except that in this instance the canary obviously
  existed in the person of the young man who sat at her side, introduced
  formally to the household for the first time. That young man's name
  was&mdash;at the moment&mdash;Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald.</p>

  <p>It seems idle to attempt any description of a person who, in the past, had
  secured a certain amount of fame under a varying personality; and who, in the
  future, was to become more than ever notorious under a far less aristocratic
  pseudonym than that by which he was at present known to the inhabitants of
  Daisy Villa. There are photographs of him in New York and Paris, St.
  Petersburg and Chicago, Vienna and Cape Town, but there are no two pictures
  which present to the casual observer the slightest likeness to one another.
  To allude to him by the name under which he had won some part, at least, of
  the affections of Miss Maud Barnes, Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald, as he sat there,
  a suitor on probation for her hand, was a young man of modest and genteel
  appearance. He wore a blue serge suit&mdash;a little underdressed for the
  occasion, perhaps; but his tie and collar were neat; his gold-rimmed
  spectacles&mdash;if a little disapproved of by Maud on account of the air of
  steadiness which they imparted&mdash;suggested excellent son-in-lawlike
  qualities to Mr. and Mrs. Barnes. He had the promise of a fair moustache, but
  his complexion generally was colourless. His features, except for a certain
  regularity, were undistinguished. His speech was modest and correct. His
  manner varied with his company. To-night it had been pronounced, by excellent
  judges&mdash;genteel.</p>

  <p>The conversation consisted&mdash;naturally enough, under the
  circumstances&mdash;of a course of subtle and judicious pumping, tactfully
  prompted, for the most part, by Mrs. Barnes. Such, for instance, as the
  following:</p>

  <p>"Talking about Marie Corelli's new book reminds me, Mr.
  Fitzgerald&mdash;your occupation is connected with books, is it not?" his
  prospective mother-in-law enquired, artlessly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fitzgerald bowed assent.</p>

  <p>"I am cashier at Howell &amp; Wilson's in Cheapside," he said. "We sell a
  great many books there&mdash;as many, I should think, as any retail
  establishment in London."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" Mrs. Barnes purred. "Very interesting work, I am sure. So nice
  and intellectual, too; for, of course, you must be looking inside them
  sometimes."</p>

  <p>"I know the place well," Mr. Adolphus Barnes, Junior, announced
  condescendingly,&mdash;"pass it every day on my way to lunch."</p>

  <p>"So much nicer," Mrs. Barnes continued, "than any of the ordinary
  businesses&mdash;grocery or drapery, or anything of that sort."</p>

  <p>Miss Maud elevated her eyebrows slightly. Was it likely that she would
  have looked with eyes of favour upon a young man engaged in any of these
  inferior occupations?</p>

  <p>"There's money in books, too," Mr. Barnes declared with sudden
  inspiration. His prospective son-in-law turned towards him deferentially.</p>

  <p>"You are right, sir," he admitted. "There is money in them. There's money
  for those who write, and there's money for those who sell. My occupation," he
  continued, with a modest little cough, "brings me often into touch with
  publishers, travellers and clerks, so I am, as it were, behind the scenes to
  some extent. I can assure you," he continued, looking from Mr. Barnes to his
  wife, and finally transfixing Mr. Adolphus&mdash;"I can assure you that the
  money paid by some firms of publishers to a few well-known authors&mdash;I
  will mention no names&mdash;as advances against royalties, is something
  stupendous!"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Mr. Barnes murmured, solemnly shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Marie Corelli, I expect, and that Hall Caine," remarked young
  Adolphus.</p>

  <p>"Seems easy enough to write a book, too," Mrs. Barnes said. "Why, I
  declare that some of those we get from the library&mdash;we subscribe to a
  library, Mr. Fitzgerald&mdash;are just as simple and straightforward that a
  child might have written them. No plot whatsoever, no murders or mysteries or
  anything of that sort&mdash;just stories about people like ourselves. I don't
  see how they can pay people for writing stories about people just like those
  one meets every day!"</p>

  <p>"I always say," Maud intervened, "that Spencer means to write a book some
  day. He has quite the literary air, hasn't he, mother?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed he has!" Mrs. Barnes declared, with an appreciative glance at the
  gold-rimmed spectacles.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fitzgerald modestly disclaimed any literary aspirations.</p>

  <p>"The thing is a gift, after all," he declared, generously. "I can keep
  accounts, and earn a fair salary at it, but if I attempted fiction I should
  soon be up a tree."</p>

  <p>Mr. Barnes nodded his approval of such sentiments.</p>

  <p>"Every one to his trade, I say," he remarked. "What sort of salaries do
  they pay now in the book trade?" he asked guilelessly.</p>

  <p>"Very fair," Mr. Fitzgerald admitted candidly,&mdash;"very fair
  indeed."</p>

  <p>"When I was your age," Mr. Barnes said reflectively, "I was
  getting&mdash;let me see&mdash;forty-two shillings a week. Pretty good pay,
  too, for those days."</p>

  <p>Mr. Fitzgerald admitted the fact.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he said apologetically, "salaries are a little higher now all
  round. Mr. Howell has been very kind to me,&mdash;in fact I have had two
  raises this year. I am getting four pounds ten now."</p>

  <p>"Four pounds ten per week?" Mrs. Barnes exclaimed, laying down her knife
  and fork.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Mr. Fitzgerald answered. "After Christmas, I have some reason
  to believe that it may be five pounds."</p>

  <p>Mr. Barnes whistled softly, and looked at the young man with a new
  respect.</p>

  <p>"I told you that&mdash;Mr.&mdash;that Spencer was doing pretty well,
  Mother," Maud simpered, looking down at her plate.</p>

  <p>"Any one to support?" her father asked, transferring a pickle from the
  fork to his mouth.</p>

  <p>"No one," Mr. Fitzgerald answered. "In fact, I may say that I have some
  small expectations. I haven't done badly, either, out of the few investments
  I have made from time to time."</p>

  <p>"Saved a bit of money, eh?" Mr. Barnes enquired genially.</p>

  <p>"I have a matter of four hundred pounds put by," Mr. Fitzgerald admitted
  modestly, "besides a few sticks of furniture. I never cared much about
  lodging-house things, so I furnished a couple of rooms myself some time
  ago."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Barnes rose slowly to her feet.</p>

  <p>"You are quite sure you won't have a small piece more of beef?" she
  enquired anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Just a morsel?" Mr. Barnes asked, tapping the joint insinuatingly with
  his carving knife.</p>

  <p>"No, I thank you!" Mr. Fitzgerald declared firmly. "I have done
  excellently."</p>

  <p>"Then if you will put the joint on the sideboard, Adolphus," Mrs. Barnes
  directed, "Maud and I will change the plates. We always let the girl go out
  on Sundays, Mr. Fitzgerald," she explained, turning to their guest. "It's
  very awkward, of course, but they seem to expect it."</p>

  <p>"Quite natural, I'm sure," Mr. Fitzgerald murmured, watching Maud's light
  movements with admiring eyes. "I like to see ladies interested in domestic
  work."</p>

  <p>"There's one thing I will say for Maud," her proud mother declared,
  plumping down a dish of jelly upon the table, "she does know what's what in
  keeping house, and even if she hasn't to scrape and save as I did when David
  and I were first married, economy is a great thing when you're young. I have
  always said so, and I stick to it."</p>

  <p>"Quite right, Mother," Mr. Barnes declared.</p>

  <p>"If instead of sitting there," Mrs. Barnes continued in high good humour,
  "you were to get a bottle of that port wine out of the cellarette, we might
  drink Mr. Fitzgerald's health, being as it's his first visit."</p>

  <p>Mr. Barnes rose to his feet with alacrity. "For a woman with sound ideas,"
  he declared, "commend me to your mother!"</p>

  <p>Maud, having finished her duties, resumed her place by the side of the
  guest of the evening. Their hands met under the tablecloth for a moment. To
  the girl, the pleasure of such a proceeding was natural enough, but
  Fitzgerald asked himself for the fiftieth time why on earth he, who,
  notwithstanding his present modest exterior, was a young man of some
  experience, should from such primitive love-making derive a rapture which
  nothing else in life afforded him. He was, at that moment, content with his
  future,&mdash;a future which he had absolutely and finally decided upon. He
  was content with his father-in-law and his mother-in-law, with Daisy Villa,
  and the prospect of a Daisy Villa for himself,&mdash;content, even, with
  Adolphus! But for Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald, these things were not to be! The
  awakening was even then at hand.</p>

  <p>The dining room of Daisy Villa fronted the street, and was removed from it
  only a few feet. Consequently, the footsteps of passers-by upon the flagged
  pavement were clearly distinguishable. It was just at the moment when Mrs.
  Barnes was inserting a few fresh almonds into a somewhat precarious tipsy
  cake, and Mr. Barnes was engaged with the decanting of the port, that two
  pairs of footsteps, considerably heavier than those of the ordinary
  promenader, paused outside and finally stopped. The gate creaked. Mr. Barnes
  looked up.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he exclaimed. "What's that? Visitors?"</p>

  <p>They all listened. The front-door bell rang. Adolphus, in response to a
  gesture from his mother, rose sulkily to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Job I hate!" he muttered as he left the room.</p>

  <p>The rest of the family, full of the small curiosity of people of their
  class, were intent upon listening for voices outside. The demeanour of Mr.
  Spencer Fitzgerald, therefore, escaped their notice. It is doubtful, in any
  case, whether their perceptions would have been sufficiently keen to have
  enabled them to trace the workings of emotion in the countenance of a person
  so magnificently endowed by Providence with the art of subterfuge. Mr.
  Spencer Fitzgerald seemed simply to have stiffened in acute and earnest
  attention. It was only for a moment that he hesitated. His unfailing
  inspiration told him the truth!</p>

  <p>His course of action was simple,&mdash;he rose to his feet and strolled to
  the window.</p>

  <p>"Some people who have lost their way in the fog, perhaps," he remarked.
  "What a night!"</p>

  <p>He laid his hand upon the sash&mdash;simultaneously there was a rush of
  cold air into the room, a half-angry, half-frightened exclamation from
  Adolphus in the passage, a scream from Miss Maud&mdash;and no Mr. Spencer
  Fitzgerald! No one had time to be more than blankly astonished. The door was
  opened, and a police inspector, in very nice dark braided uniform and a
  peaked cap, stood in the doorway.</p>

  <p>Mr. Barnes dropped the port, and Mrs. Barnes, emulating her daughter's
  example, screamed. The inspector, as though conscious of the draught, moved
  rapidly toward the window.</p>

  <p>"You had a visitor here, Mr. Barnes," he said quickly&mdash;"a Mr. Spencer
  Fitzgerald. Where is he?"</p>

  <p>There was no one who could answer! Mr. Barnes was speechless between the
  shock of the spilt port and the appearance of a couple of uniformed policemen
  in his dining room. John Dory, the detective, he knew well enough in his
  private capacity, but in his uniform, and attended by policemen, he presented
  a new and startling appearance! Mrs. Barnes was in hysterics, and Maud was
  gazing like a creature turned to stone at the open window, through which
  little puffs of fog were already drifting into the room. Adolphus, with an
  air of bewilderment, was standing with his mouth and eyes wider open than
  they had ever been in his life. And as for the honoured guest of these
  admirable inhabitants of Daisy Villa, there was not the slightest doubt but
  that Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald had disappeared through the window!</p>

  <p>Fitzgerald's expedition was nearly at an end. Soon he paused, crossed the
  road to a block of flats, ascended to the eighth floor by an automatic lift,
  and rang the bell at a door which bore simply the number II. A trim
  parlourmaid opened it after a few minutes' delay.</p>

  <p>"Is Miss Emerson at home?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Miss Emerson is in," the maid admitted, with some hesitation, "but I am
  not sure that she will see any one to-night."</p>

  <p>"I have a message for her," Fitzgerald said.</p>

  <p>"Will you give me your name, sir, please?" the maid asked.</p>

  <p>An inner door was suddenly opened. A slim girl, looking taller than she
  really was by reason of the rug upon which she stood, looked out into the
  hall&mdash;a girl with masses of brown hair loosely coiled on her head, with
  pale face and strange eyes. She opened her lips as though to call to her
  visitor by name, and as suddenly closed them again. There was not much
  expression in her face, but there was enough to show that his visit was not
  unwelcome.</p>

  <p>"You!" she exclaimed. "Come in! Please come in at once!"</p>

  <p>Fitzgerald obeyed the invitation of the girl whom he had come to visit.
  She had retreated a little into the room, but the door was no sooner closed
  than she held out her hands.</p>

  </div>

  <p>"Peter!" she exclaimed. "Peter, you have come to me at last!"</p>

  <p>Her lips were a little parted; her eyes were bright with pleasure; her
  whole expression was one of absolute delight. Fitzgerald frowned, as though
  he found her welcome a little too enthusiastic for his taste.</p>

  <p>"Violet," he said, "please don't look at me as though I were a prodigal
  sheep. If you do, I shall be sorry that I came."</p>

  <p>Her hands fell to her side, the pleasure died out of her face&mdash;only
  her eyes still questioned him. Fitzgerald carefully laid his hat on a vacant
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Something has happened?" she said. "Tell me that all that madness is
  over&mdash;that you are yourself again!"</p>

  <p>"So far as regards my engagement with Messrs. Howell &amp; Wilson," he
  said, despondently, "you are right. As regards&mdash;Miss Barnes, there has
  been no direct misunderstanding between us, but I am afraid, for the present,
  that I must consider that&mdash;well, in abeyance."</p>

  <p>"That is something!" she exclaimed, drawing a little breath of relief.
  "Sit down, Peter. Will you have something to eat? I finished dinner an hour
  ago, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Fitzgerald interrupted, "I supped&mdash;extremely well in
  Streatham!"</p>

  <p>"In Streatham!" she repeated. "Why, how did you get there? The fog is
  awful."</p>

  <p>"Fogs do not trouble me," Fitzgerald answered. "I walked. I could have
  done it as well blindfold. I will take a whisky and soda, if I may."</p>

  <p>She led him to an easy-chair.</p>

  <p>"I will mix it myself," she said.</p>

  <p>Without being remarkably good-looking, she was certainly a pleasant and
  attractive-looking young woman. Her cheeks were a little pale; her
  hair&mdash;perfectly natural&mdash;was a wonderful deep shade of soft brown.
  Her eyes were long and narrow&mdash;almost Oriental in shape&mdash;and they
  seemed in some queer way to match the room; he could have sworn that in the
  firelight they flashed green. Her body and limbs, notwithstanding her extreme
  slightness, were graceful, perhaps, but with the grace of the tigress. She
  wore a green silk dressing jacket, pulled together with a belt of lizard
  skin, and her neck was bare. Her skirt was of some thin black material. She
  was obviously in deshabille, and yet there was something neat and trim about
  the smaller details of her toilette.</p>

  <p>"Go on, please, Peter," she begged. "You are keeping me in suspense."</p>

  <p>"There isn't much to tell," he answered. "It's over&mdash;that's all."</p>

  <p>She drew a sharp breath through her teeth.</p>

  <p>"You are not going to marry that girl&mdash;that bourgeois doll in
  Streatham?"</p>

  <p>Fitzgerald sat up in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, seriously, "don't you call her names. If I'm not
  going to marry her, it isn't my fault. She is the only girl I have ever
  wanted, and probably&mdash;most probably&mdash;she will be the only one I
  ever shall want. That's honest, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>The girl winced.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "it is honest!"</p>

  <p>"I should have married her," the young man continued, "and I should have
  been happy. I had my eye on a villa&mdash;not too near her parents&mdash;and
  I saw my way to a little increase of salary. I should have taken to
  gardening, to walks in the Park, with an occasional theatre, and I should
  have thoroughly enjoyed a fortnight every summer at Skegness or
  Sutton-on-Sea. We should have saved a little money. I should have gone to
  church regularly, and if possible I should have filled some minor public
  offices. You may call this bourgeois&mdash;it was my idea of happiness."</p>

  <p>"Was!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Is still," he declared, sharply, "but I shall never attain to it.
  To-night I had to leave Maud&mdash;to leave the supper table of Daisy
  Villa&mdash;through the window!"</p>

  <p>She looked at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>"The police," he explained. "That brute Dory was at the bottom of it."</p>

  <p>"But surely," she murmured, "you told me that you had a bona-fide
  situation&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So I had," he declared, "and I was a fool not to be content with it. It
  was my habit of taking long country walks, and their rotten auditing, which
  undid me! You understand that this was all before I met Maud? Since the day I
  spoke to her, I turned over a new leaf. I have left the night work alone, and
  I repaid every penny of the firm's money which they could ever have possibly
  found out about. There was only that one little affair of mine down at
  Sudbury."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you are going to do?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"I have no alternative," he answered. "The law has kicked me out from the
  respectable places. The law shall pay!"</p>

  <p>She looked at him with glowing eyes.</p>

  <p>"Have you any plans?" she asked, softly.</p>

  <p>"I have," he answered. "I have considered the subject from a good many
  points of view, and I have decided to start in business for myself as a
  private detective."</p>

  <p>She raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"My dear Peter!" she murmured. "Couldn't you be a little more
  original?"</p>

  <p>"That is only what I am going to call myself," he answered. "I may tell
  you that I am going to strike out on somewhat new lines."</p>

  <p>"Please explain," she begged.</p>

  <p>He recrossed his knees and made himself a little more comfortable.</p>

  <p>"The weak part of every great robbery, however successful," he began, "is
  the great wastage in value which invariably results. For jewels which
  cost&mdash;say five thousand pounds, and to procure which the artist has to
  risk his life as well as his liberty, he has to consider himself lucky if he
  clears eight hundred. For the Hermitage rubies, for instance, where I nearly
  had to shoot a man dead, I realized rather less than four hundred pounds. It
  doesn't pay."</p>

  <p>"Go on," she begged.</p>

  <p>"I am not clear," he continued, "how far this class of business will
  attract me at all, but I do not propose, in any case, to enter into any
  transactions on my own account. I shall work for other people, and for cash
  down. Your experience of life, Violet, has been fairly large. Have you not
  sometimes come into contact with people driven into a situation from which
  they would willingly commit any crime to escape if they dared? It is not with
  them a question of money at all&mdash;it is simply a matter of ignorance.
  They do not know how to commit a crime. They have had no experience, and if
  they attempt it, they know perfectly well that they are likely to blunder. A
  person thoroughly experienced in the ways of criminals&mdash;a person of
  genius like myself&mdash;would have, without a doubt, an immense clientele,
  if only he dared put up his signboard. Literally, I cannot do that. Actually,
  I mean to do so! I shall be willing to accept contracts either to help
  nervous people out of an undesirable crisis; or, on the other hand, to
  measure my wits against the wits of Scotland Yard, and to discover the
  criminals whom they have failed to secure. I shall make my own bargains, and
  I shall be paid in cash. I shall take on nothing that I am not certain
  about."</p>

  <p>"But your clients?" she asked, curiously. "How will you come into contact
  with them?"</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am not afraid of business being slack," he said. "The world is full of
  fools."</p>

  <p>"You cannot live outside the law, Peter," she objected. "You are clever, I
  know, but they are not all fools at Scotland Yard."</p>

  <p>"You forget," he reminded her, "that there will be a perfectly legitimate
  side to my profession. The other sort of case I shall only accept if I can
  see my way clear to make a success of it. Needless to say, I shall have to
  refuse the majority that are offered to me."</p>

  <p>She came a little nearer to him.</p>

  <p>"In any case," she said, with a little sigh, "you have given up that
  foolish, bourgeois life of yours?"</p>

  <p>He looked down into her face, and his eyes were cold.</p>

  <p>"Violet," he said, "this is no time for misunderstandings. I should like
  you to know that apart from one young lady, who possesses my whole
  affection&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All of it?" she pleaded.</p>

  <p>"All!" he declared emphatically. "She will doubtless be faithless to
  me&mdash;under the circumstances, I cannot blame her&mdash;but so far as I am
  concerned, I have no affection whatever for any one else."</p>

  <p>She crept back to her place.</p>

  <p>"I could be so useful to you," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"You could and you shall, if you will be sensible," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Tell me how?" she begged.</p>

  <p>He was silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Are you acting now?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am understudying Molly," she answered, "and I have a very small part at
  the Globe."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"There is no reason to interfere with that," he said, "in fact, I wish you
  to continue your connection with the profession. It brings you into touch
  with the class of people among whom I am likely to find clients."</p>

  <p>"Go on, please," she begged.</p>

  <p>"On two conditions&mdash;or rather one," he said, "you can, if you like,
  become my secretary and partner&mdash;and find the money we shall require to
  make a start."</p>

  <p>"Conditions?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You must understand, once and for all," he said, "that I will not be made
  love to, and that I can treat you only as a working; companion. My name will
  be Peter Ruff, and yours Miss Brown. You will have to dress like a secretary,
  and behave like one. Sometimes there will be plenty of work for you, and
  sometimes there will be none at all. Sometimes you will be bored to death,
  and sometimes there will be excitement. I do not wish to make you vain, but I
  may add, especially as you are aware of my personal feelings toward you, that
  you are the only person in the world to whom I would make this offer."</p>

  <p>She sighed gently.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Peter," she asked, "when do you mean to start this new
  enterprise?"</p>

  <p>"Not for six months&mdash;perhaps a year," he answered. "I must go to
  Paris&mdash;perhaps Vienna. I might even have to go to New York. There are
  certain associations with which I must come into touch&mdash;certain
  information I must become possessed of."</p>

  <p>"Peter," she said, "I like your scheme, but there is just one thing. Such
  men as you should be the brains of great enterprises. Don't you understand
  what I mean? It shouldn't be you who does the actual thing which brings you
  within the power of the law. I am not over-scrupulous, you know. I hate
  wrongdoing, but I have never been able to treat as equal criminals the poor
  man who steals for a living, and the rich financier who robs right and left
  out of sheer greed. I agree with you that crime is not an absolute thing. The
  circumstances connected with every action in life determine its morality or
  immorality. But, Peter, it isn't worth while to go outside the law!"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"You are a sensible girl," he said, "I have always thought that. We'll
  talk over my cases together, if they seem to run a little too close to the
  line."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Peter," she said, "I accept."</p>

  <h2>II. A NEW CAREER<br>
  <small>(No record of magazine publication found)</small></h2>

  <p class="first">About twelve months after the interrupted festivities at
  Daisy Villa, that particular neighbourhood was again the scene of some
  rejoicing. Standing before the residence of Mr. Barnes were three carriages,
  drawn in each case by a pair of grey horses. The coachmen and their steeds
  were similarly adorned with white rosettes. It would have been an insult to
  the intelligence of the most youthful of the loungers-by to have informed
  them that a wedding was projected.</p>

  <p>At the neighbouring church all was ready. The clerk stood at the door, the
  red drugget was down, the usual little crowd were standing all agog upon the
  pavement. There was one unusual feature of the proceedings: Instead of a
  solitary policeman, there were at least a dozen who kept clear the entrance
  to the church. Their presence greatly puzzled a little old gentleman who had
  joined the throng of sightseers. He pushed himself to the front and touched
  one of them upon the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Policeman," he said, "will you tell me why there are so many of you
  to keep such a small crowd in order?"</p>

  <p>"Bridegroom's a member of the force, sir, for one reason," the man
  answered good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>"And the other?" the old gentleman persisted.</p>

  <p>The policeman behaved as though he had not heard&mdash;a proceeding which
  his natural stolidity rendered easy. The little old gentleman, however, was
  not so easily put off. He tapped the man once more upon the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"And the other reason, Mr. Policeman?" he asked insinuatingly.</p>

  <p>"Not allowed to talk about that, sir," was the somewhat gruff reply.</p>

  <p>The little old gentleman moved away, a trifle hurt. He was a very nicely
  dressed old gentleman indeed, and everything about him seemed to savour of
  prosperity. But he was certainly garrulous. An obviously invited guest was
  standing upon the edge of the pavement stroking a pair of lavender kid
  gloves. The little old gentleman sidled up to him.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir," he said, raising his hat. "I am just back from
  Australia&mdash;haven't seen a wedding in England for fifty years. Do you
  think that they would let me into the church?"</p>

  <p>The invited guest looked down at his questioner and approved of him.
  Furthermore, he seemed exceedingly glad to be interrupted in his somewhat
  nervous task of waiting for the wedding party.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir," he replied cheerfully. "Come along in with me, and I'll
  find you a seat."</p>

  <p>Down the scarlet drugget they went&mdash;the big best man with the red
  hands and the lavender kid gloves and the opulent-looking old gentleman with
  the gold-rimmed spectacles and the handsome walking stick.</p>

  <p>"Dear me, this is very interesting!" the latter remarked. "Is it the
  custom, sir, always, may I ask, in this country, to have so many policemen at
  a wedding?"</p>

  <p>The big man looked downward and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Special reason," he said mysteriously. "Fact is, young lady was engaged
  once to a very bad character&mdash;a burglar whom the police have been
  wanting for years. He had to leave the country, but he has written her once
  or twice since in a mysterious sort of way&mdash;wanted her to be true to
  him, and all that sort of thing. Dory&mdash;that's the bridegroom&mdash;has
  got a sort of an idea that he may turn up to-day."</p>

  <p>"This is very exciting&mdash;very!" the little old gentleman remarked.
  "Reminds me of our younger days out in Australia."</p>

  <p>"You sit down here," the best man directed, ushering his companion into an
  empty pew. "I must get back again outside, or I shall have the bridegroom
  arriving."</p>

  <p>"Good-day to you, sir, and many thanks!" the little old gentleman said
  politely.</p>

  <p>Soon the bridegroom arrived&mdash;a smart young officer, well thought of
  at Scotland Yard, well set up, wearing a long tail coat a lilac and white
  tie, and shaking in every limb. He walked up the aisle accompanied by the
  best man, and the little old gentleman from Australia watched him genially
  from behind those gold-rimmed glasses. And, then, scarcely was he at the
  altar rails when through the open church door one heard the sounds of horses'
  feet, one heard a rustle, the murmur of voices, caught a glimpse of a waiting
  group arranging themselves finally in the porch of the church. Maud, on the
  arm of her father, came slowly up the aisle. The little old gentleman turned
  his head as though this was something upon which he feared to look. He saw
  nothing of Mr. Barnes, in a new coat, with tuberose and spray of maidenhair
  in his coat, and exceedingly tight patent leather boots on his feet; he saw
  nothing of Mrs. Barnes, clad in a gown of the lightest magenta, with a bonnet
  smothered with violets.</p>

  <p>It was in the vestry that the only untoward incident of that highly
  successful wedding took place. The ceremony was over! Bride, bridegroom and
  parents trooped in. And when the register was opened, one witness had already
  signed! In the clear, precise writing his name stood out upon the virgin
  page&mdash;</p>

  <p>Spencer Fitzgerald</p>

  <p>The bridegroom swore, the bride nearly collapsed. The clerk pressed into
  the hands of the latter an envelope.</p>

  <p>"From the little old gentleman," he announced, "who was fussing round the
  church this morning."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Dory tore it open and gave a cry of delight. A diamond cross, worth
  all the rest of her presents put together, flashed soft lights from a
  background of dull velvet. Her husband had looked over her shoulder, and with
  a scowl seized the morocco case and threw it far from him.</p>

  <p>It was the only disturbing incident of a highly successful function!</p>

  <p>At precisely the same moment when the wedding guests were seated around
  the hospitable board of Daisy Villa, a celebration of a somewhat different
  nature was taking place in the more aristocratic neighbourhood of Curzon
  Street. Here, however, the little party was a much smaller one, and the
  innocent gaiety of the gathering at Daisy Villa was entirely lacking. The
  luncheon table around which the four men were seated presented all the
  unlovely signs of a meal where self-restraint had been abandoned&mdash;where
  conviviality has passed the bounds of licence. Edibles were represented only
  by a single dish of fruit; the tablecloth, stained with wine and cigar ash,
  seemed crowded with every sort of bottle and every sort of glass. A magnum of
  champagne, empty, another half full, stood in the middle of the table;
  whisky, brandy, liqueurs of various sorts were all represented;
  glasses&mdash;some full, some empty, some filled with cigar ash and cigarette
  stumps&mdash;an ugly sight!</p>

  <p>The guest in chief arose. Short, thick-set, red-faced, with bulbous eyes,
  and veins about his temples which just now were unpleasantly prominent, he
  seemed, indeed, a very fitting person to have been the recipient of such
  hospitality. He stood clutching a little at the tablecloth and swaying upon
  his feet. He spoke as a drunken man, but such words as he pronounced clearly
  showed him to be possessed of a voice naturally thick and raspy. It was
  obvious that he was a person of entirely different class from his three
  companions.</p>

  <p>"G&mdash;gentlemen," he said, "I must be off. I thank you very much for
  this&mdash;hospitality. Honoured, I'm sure, to have sat down in
  such&mdash;such company. Good afternoon, all!"</p>

  <p>He lurched a little toward the door, but his neighbour at the
  table&mdash;who was also his host&mdash;caught hold of his coat tail and
  pulled him back into his chair.</p>

  <p>"No hurry, Masters," he said. "One more liqueur, eh? It's a raw
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>"N&mdash;not another drop, Sir Richard!" the man declared. "Not another
  drop to drink. I am very much obliged to you all, but I must be off. Must be
  off," he repeated, making another effort to rise.</p>

  <p>His host held him by the arm. The man resented it&mdash;he showed signs of
  anger.</p>

  <p>"D&mdash;n it all! I&mdash;I'm not a prisoner, am I?" he exclaimed
  angrily. "Tell you I've got&mdash;appointment&mdash;club. Can't you see it's
  past five o'clock?"</p>

  <p>"That's all right, Masters," the man whom he had addressed as Sir Richard
  declared soothingly. "We want just a word with you on business first, before
  you go&mdash;Colonel Dickinson, Lord Merries and myself."</p>

  <p>Masters shook his head.</p>

  <p>"See you to-morrow," he declared. "No time to talk business now. Let me
  go!"</p>

  <p>He made another attempt to rise, which his host also prevented.</p>

  <p>"Masters, don't be a fool!" the latter said firmly. "You've got to hear
  what we want to say to you. Sit down and listen."</p>

  <p>Masters relapsed sullenly into his chair. His little eyes seemed to creep
  closer to one another. So they wanted to talk business! Perhaps it was for
  that reason that they had bidden him sit at their table&mdash;had entertained
  him so well! The very thought cleared his brain.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he said shortly.</p>

  <p>Sir Richard lit a cigarette and leaned further back in his chair. He was a
  man apparently about fifty years of age&mdash;tall, well dressed, with good
  features, save for his mouth, which resembled more than anything a rat trap.
  He was perfectly bald, and he had the air of a man who was a careful liver.
  His eyes were bright, almost beadlike; his fingers long and a trifle
  over-manicured. One would have judged him to be what he was&mdash;a man of
  fashion and a patron of the turf.</p>

  <p>"Masters," he said, "we are all old friends here. We want to speak to you
  plainly. We three have had a try, as you know&mdash;Merries, Dickinson and
  myself&mdash;to make the coup of our lives. We failed, and we're up against
  it hard."</p>

  <p>"Very hard, indeed," Lord Merries murmured softly.</p>

  <p>"Deuced hard!" Colonel Dickinson echoed.</p>

  <p>Masters was sitting tight, breathing a little hard, looking fixedly at his
  host.</p>

  <p>"Take my own case first," the latter continued. "I am Sir Richard Dyson,
  ninth baronet, with estates in Wiltshire and Scotland, and a town house in
  Cleveland Place. I belong to the proper clubs for a man in my position, and,
  somehow or other&mdash;we won't say how&mdash;I have managed to pay my way.
  There isn't an acre of my property that isn't mortgaged for more than its
  value. My town house&mdash;well, it doesn't belong to me at all! I have
  twenty-six thousand pounds to pay you on Monday. To save my life, I could not
  raise twenty-six thousand farthings! So much for me."</p>

  <p>The man Masters ground his teeth.</p>

  <p>"So much for you!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Take the case next," Sir Richard continued, "of my friend Merries here.
  Merries is an Earl, it is true, but he never had a penny to bless himself
  with. He's tried acting, reporting, marrying&mdash;anything to make an honest
  living. So far, I am afraid we must consider Lord Merries as something of a
  failure, eh?"</p>

  <p>"A rotten failure, I should say," that young nobleman declared
  gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Lord Merries is, to put it briefly, financially unsound," Sir Richard
  declared.</p>

  <p>"What is the amount of your debt to Mr. Masters, Jim?"</p>

  <p>"Eleven thousand two hundred pounds," Lord Merries answered.</p>

  <p>"And we may take it, I presume, for granted that you have not that sum,
  nor anything like it, at your disposal?" Sir Richard asked.</p>

  <p>"Not a fiver!" Lord Merries declared with emphasis.</p>

  <p>"We come now, Mr. Masters, to our friend Colonel Dickinson," Sir Richard
  continued. "Colonel Dickinson is, perhaps, in a more favourable situation
  than any of us. He has a small but regular income, and he has expectations
  which it is not possible to mortgage fully. At the same time, it will be many
  years before they can&mdash;er&mdash;fructify. He is, therefore, with us in
  this somewhat unpleasant predicament in which we find ourselves."</p>

  <p>"Cut it short," Masters growled. "I'm sick of so much talk. What's it all
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"It means simply this, Mr. Masters," Sir Richard said, "we want you to
  take six months' bills for our indebtedness to you."</p>

  <p>Masters rose to his feet. His thick lips were drawn a little apart. He had
  the appearance of a savage and discontented animal.</p>

  <p>"So that's why I've been asked here and fed up with wine and stuff, eh?"
  he exclaimed thickly. "Well, my answer to you is soon given. NO! I'll take
  bills from no man! My terms are cash on settling day&mdash;cash to pay or
  cash to receive. I'll have no other!"</p>

  <p>Sir Richard rose also to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Masters, I beg of you to be reasonable," he said. "You will do
  yourself no good by adopting this attitude. Facts are facts. We haven't got a
  thousand pounds between us."</p>

  <p>"I've heard that sort of a tale before," Masters answered, with a sneer.
  "Job Masters is too old a bird to be caught by such chaff. I'll take my
  risks, gentlemen. I'll take my risks."</p>

  <p>He moved toward the door. No one spoke a word. The silence as he crossed
  the room seemed a little ominous. He looked over his shoulder. They were all
  three standing in their places, looking at him. A vague sense of uneasiness
  disturbed his equanimity.</p>

  <p>"No offence, gents," he said, "and good afternoon!"</p>

  <p>Still no reply. He reached the door and turned the handle. The door was
  fast. He shook it&mdash;gently at first, and then violently. Suddenly he
  realized that it was locked. He turned sharply around.</p>

  <p>"What game's this?" he exclaimed, fiercely. "Let me out!"</p>

  <p>They stood in their places without movement. There was something a little
  ominous in their silence. Masters was fast becoming a sober man.</p>

  <p>"Let me out of here," he exclaimed, "or I'll break the door down!"</p>

  <p>Sir Richard Dyson came slowly towards him. There was something in his
  appearance which terrified Masters. He raised his fist to strike the door. He
  was a fighting man, but he felt a sudden sense of impotence.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Masters," Sir Richard said suavely, "the truth is that we cannot
  afford to let you go&mdash;unless you agree to do what we have asked. You see
  we really have not the money or any way of raising it&mdash;and the
  inconvenience of being posted you have yourself very ably pointed out. Change
  your mind, Mr. Masters. Take those bills. We'll do our best to meet
  them."</p>

  <p>"I'll do nothing of the sort," Masters answered, striking the door
  fiercely with his clenched fist. "I'll have cash&mdash;nothing but the
  cash!"</p>

  <p>There was a dull, sickening thud, and the bookmaker went over like a shot
  rabbit. His legs twitched for a moment&mdash;a little moan that was scarcely
  audible broke from his lips. Then he lay quite still. Sir Richard bent over
  him with the life preserver still in his hand.</p>

  <p>"I've done it!" he muttered, hoarsely. "One blow! Thank Heaven, he didn't
  want another! His skull was as soft as pudding! Ugh!"</p>

  <p>He turned away. The man who lay stretched upon the floor was an ugly
  sight. His two companions, cowering over the table, were not much better.
  Dyson's trembling fingers went out for the brandy decanter. Half of what he
  poured out was spilled upon the tablecloth. The rest he drank from a tumbler,
  neat.</p>

  <p>"It's nervous work, this, you fellows," he said, hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"It's hellish!" Dickinson answered. "Let's have some air in the room. By
  God, it's close!"</p>

  <p>He sank back into his chair, white to the lips. Dyson looked at him
  sharply.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he exclaimed, "I hold you both to our bargain! I was to be
  the one he attacked and who struck the blow&mdash;in self-defence! Remember
  that&mdash;it was in self-defence! I've done it! I've done my share! I hope
  to God I'll forget it some day. Andrew, you know your task. Be a man, and get
  to work!"</p>

  <p>Dickinson rose to his feet unsteadily. "Yes!" he said. "What was it? I
  have forgotten, for the moment, but I am ready."</p>

  <p>"You must get his betting book from his pocket," Sir Richard directed.
  "Then you must help Merries downstairs with him, and into the car. Merries
  is&mdash;to get rid of him."</p>

  <p>Merries shivered. His hand, too, went out for the brandy.</p>

  <p>"To get rid of him," he muttered. "It sounds easy!"</p>

  <p>"It is easy," Sir Richard declared. "You have only to keep your nerve, and
  the thing is done. No one will see him inside the car, in that motoring coat
  and glasses. You can drive somewhere out into the country and leave him."</p>

  <p>"Leave him!" Merries repeated, trembling. "Leave him&mdash;yes!"</p>

  <p>Neither of the two men moved.</p>

  <p>"I must do more than my share, I suppose," Sir Richard declared
  contemptuously. "Come!"</p>

  <p>They dragged the man's body on to a chair, wrapped a huge coat around him,
  tied a motoring cap under his chin, fixed goggles over his eyes. Sir Richard
  strolled into the hall and opened the front door. He stood there for a
  moment, looking up and down the street. When he gave the signal they dragged
  him out, supported between them, across the pavement, into the car. Ugh! His
  attitude was so natural as to be absolutely ghastly. Merries started the car
  and sprang into the driver's seat. There were people in the Square now, but
  the figure reclining in the dark, cushioned interior looked perfectly
  natural.</p>

  <p>"So long, Jimmy," Sir Richard called out. "See you this evening."</p>

  <p>"Right O!" Merries replied, with a brave effort.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff, summoned by telephone from his sitting room, slipped down the
  stairs like a cat&mdash;noiseless, swift. The voice which had summoned him
  had been the voice of his secretary&mdash;a voice almost
  unrecognisable&mdash;a voice shaken with fear. Fear? No, it had been
  terror!</p>

  <p>On the landing below, exactly underneath the room from which he had
  descended, there was a door upon which his name was written upon a small
  brass plate&mdash;Mr. Peter Ruff. He opened and closed it behind him with a
  swift movement which he had practised in his idle moments. He found himself
  looking in upon a curious scene.</p>

  <p>Miss Brown, with the radiance of her hair effectually concealed, in plain
  black skirt and simple blouse&mdash;the ideal secretary&mdash;had risen from
  the seat in front of her typewriter, and was standing facing the door through
  which he had entered, with a small revolver&mdash;which he had given her for
  a birthday present only the day before&mdash;clasped in her outstretched
  hand. The object of her solicitude was, it seemed to Peter Ruff, the most
  pitiful-looking object upon which he had ever looked. The hours had dwelt
  with Merries as the years with some people, and worse. He had lost his cap;
  his hair hung over his forehead in wild confusion; his eyes were red,
  bloodshot, and absolutely aflame with the terrors through which he had
  lived&mdash;underneath them the black marks might have been traced with a
  charcoal pencil. His cheeks were livid save for one burning spot. His
  clothes, too, were in disorder&mdash;the starch had gone from his collar, his
  tie hung loosely outside his waistcoat. He was cowering back against the
  wall. And between him and the girl, stretched upon the floor, was the body of
  a man in a huge motor coat, a limp, inert mass which neither moved nor seemed
  to have any sign of life. No wonder that Peter Ruff looked around his office,
  whose serenity had been so tragically disturbed, with an air of mild
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Dear me," he exclaimed, "something seems to have happened! My dear
  Violet, you can put that revolver away. I have secured the door."</p>

  <p>Her hand fell to her side. She gave a little shiver of relief. Peter Ruff
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is more comfortable," he declared. "Now, perhaps, you will
  explain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That young man," she interrupted, "or lunatic&mdash;whatever he calls
  himself&mdash;burst in here a few minutes ago, dragging&mdash;that!" She
  pointed to the motionless figure upon the floor. "If I had not stopped him,
  he would have bolted off without a word of explanation."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff, with his back against the door, shook his head gravely.</p>

  <p>"My dear Lord Merries," he said, "my office is not a mortuary."</p>

  <p>Merries gasped.</p>

  <p>"You know me, then?" he muttered, hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Of course," Ruff answered. "It is my profession to know everybody. Go and
  sit down upon that easy-chair, and drink the brandy and soda which Miss Brown
  is about to mix for you. That's right."</p>

  <p>Merries staggered across the room and half fell into an easy-chair. He
  leaned over the side with his face buried in his hands, unable still to face
  the horror which lay upon the floor. A few seconds later, the tumbler of
  brandy and soda was in his hands. He drank it like a man who drains fresh
  life into his veins.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps now," Peter Ruff suggested, pointing to the motionless figure,
  "you can give me some explanation as to this!"</p>

  <p>Merries looked away from him all the time he was speaking. His voice was
  thick and nervous.</p>

  <p>"There were three of us lunching together," he began&mdash;"four in all.
  There was a dispute, and this man threatened us. Afterwards there was a
  fight. It fell to my lot to take him away, and I can't get rid of him! I
  can't get rid of him!" he repeated, with something that sounded like a
  sob.</p>

  <p>"I still do not see," Peter Ruff argued, "why you should have brought him
  here and deposited him upon my perfectly new carpet."</p>

  <p>"You are Peter Ruff," Merries declared. "'Crime Investigator and Private
  Detective,' you call yourself. You are used to this sort of thing. You will
  know what to do with it. It is part of your business."</p>

  <p>"I can assure you," Peter Ruff answered, "that you are under a delusion as
  to the details of my profession. I am Peter Ruff," he admitted, "and I call
  myself a crime investigator&mdash;in fact, I am the only one worth speaking
  of in the world. But I certainly deny that I am used to having dead bodies
  deposited upon my carpet, and that I make a habit of disposing of
  them&mdash;especially gratis."</p>

  <p>Merries tore open his coat.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he said, his voice shaking hysterically, "I must get rid of it
  or go mad. For two hours I have been driving about in a motor car
  with&mdash;it for a passenger. I drove to a quiet spot and I tried to lift it
  out&mdash;a policeman rode up! I tried again, a man rushed by on a motor
  cycle, and turned to look at me! I tried a few minutes later&mdash;the
  policeman came back! It was always the same. The night seemed to have eyes. I
  was watched everywhere. The&mdash;the face began to mock me. I'll swear that
  I heard it chuckle once!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff moved a little further away.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I'll have anything to do with it," he declared. "I don't
  like your description at all."</p>

  <p>"It'll be all right with you," Merries declared eagerly. "It's my nerves,
  that's all. You see, I was there&mdash;when the accident happened. See here,"
  he added, tearing a pocketbook from his coat, "I have three hundred and
  seventy pounds saved up in case I had to bolt. I'll keep seventy&mdash;three
  hundred for you&mdash;to dispose of it!"</p>

  <p>Ruff leaned over the motionless body, looked into its face, and
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"Masters, the bookmaker," he remarked. "H'm! I did hear that he had a lot
  of money coming to him over the Cambridgeshire."</p>

  <p>Merries shuddered.</p>

  <p>"May I go?" he pleaded. "There's the three hundred on the table. For God's
  sake, let me go!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd saved a little more," he said. "However&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He turned the lock and Merries rushed out of the room. Ruff looked across
  the room towards his secretary.</p>

  <p>"Ring up 1535 Central," he ordered, sharply.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff had descended from his apartments on the top floor of the
  building, in a new brown suit with which he was violently displeased, to meet
  a caller.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to intrude&mdash;Mr. Ruff, I believe it is?" Sir Richard Dyson
  said, a little irritably&mdash;"but I have not a great deal of time to
  spare&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Most natural!" Peter Ruff declared. "Pray take a chair, Sir Richard. You
  want to know, of course, about Lord Merries and poor Masters."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard stared at his questioner, for a moment, without speech. Once
  more the fear which he had succeeded in banishing for a while, shone in his
  eyes&mdash;revealed itself in his white face.</p>

  <p>"Try the easy-chair, Sir Richard," Ruff continued, pleasantly. "Leave your
  hat and cane on the table there, and make yourself comfortable. I should like
  to understand exactly what you have come to me for."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard moved his head toward Miss Brown.</p>

  <p>"My business with you," he said, "is more than ordinarily private. I have
  the honour of knowing Miss&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Miss Brown," Peter interrupted quickly. "In these offices, this young
  lady's name is Miss Violet Brown."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It is of no importance," he said, "only, as you may understand, my
  business with you scarcely requires the presence of a third party, even one
  with the discretion which I am sure Miss&mdash;Brown possesses."</p>

  <p>"In these matters," Ruff answered, "my secretary does not exist apart from
  myself. Her presence is necessary. She takes down in shorthand notes of our
  conversation. I have a shocking memory, and there are always points which I
  forget. At the conclusion of our business, whatever it may be, these notes
  are destroyed. I could not work without them, however."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard glanced a little doubtfully at the long, slim back of the girl
  who sat with her face turned away from him. "Of course," he began, "if you
  make yourself personally responsible for her discretion&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am willing to do so," Ruff interrupted, brusquely. "I guarantee it. Go
  on, please."</p>

  <p>"I do not know, of course, where you got your information from," Sir
  Richard began, "but it is perfectly true that I have come here to consult you
  upon a matter in which the two people whose names you have mentioned are
  concerned. The disappearance of Job Masters is, of course, common talk; but I
  cannot tell what has led you to associate with it the temporary absence of
  Lord Merries from this country."</p>

  <p>"Let me ask you this question," Ruff said. "How are you affected by the
  disappearance of Masters?"</p>

  <p>"Indirectly, it has caused me a great deal of inconvenience," Sir Richard
  declared.</p>

  <p>"Facts, please," murmured Peter.</p>

  <p>"It has been rumoured," Sir Richard admitted, "that I owed Masters a large
  sum of money which I could not pay."</p>

  <p>"Anything else?"</p>

  <p>"It has also been rumoured," Sir Richard continued, "that he was seen to
  enter my house that day, and that he remained there until late in the
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Did he?" asked Ruff.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," Sir Richard answered.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff yawned for a moment, but covered the indiscretion with his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Respecting this inconvenience," he said, "which you admit that the
  disappearance of Job Masters has caused you, what is its tangible side?"</p>

  <p>Sir Richard drew his chair a little nearer to the table where Ruff was
  sitting. His voice dropped almost to a whisper.</p>

  <p>"It seems absurd," he said, "and yet, what I tell you is the truth. I have
  been followed about&mdash;shadowed, in fact&mdash;for several days. Men, even
  in my own social circle, seem to hold aloof from me. It is as though," he
  continued slowly, "people were beginning to suspect me of being connected in
  some way with the man's disappearance."</p>

  <p>Ruff, who had been making figures with a pencil on the edge of his
  blotting paper, suddenly turned round. His eyes flashed with a new light as
  they became fixed upon his companion's.</p>

  <p>"And are you not?" he asked, calmly. Sir Richard bore himself well. For a
  moment he had shrunk back. Then he half rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ruff!" he said. "I must protest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff used no violent gesture. Only his forefinger tapped the desk in
  front of him. His voice was as smooth as velvet.</p>

  <p>"Tell me as much or as little as you please, Sir Richard," he said, "but
  let that little or that much be the truth! On those terms only I may be able
  to help you. You do not go to your physician and expect him to prescribe to
  you while you conceal your symptoms, or to your lawyer for advice and tell
  him half the truth. I am not asking for your confidence. I simply tell you
  that you are wasting your time and mine if you choose to withhold it."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard was silent. He recognized a new quality in the man&mdash;but
  the truth was an awful thing to tell! He considered&mdash;then told.</p>

  <p>Ruff briskly asked two questions. "In alluding to your heavy settlement
  with Masters, you said just now that you could not have paid
  him&mdash;then."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," Sir Richard admitted. "That is the rotten part of the whole
  affair. Four days later a wonderful double came off&mdash;one in which we
  were all interested, and one which not one of us expected. We've drawn a
  considerable amount already from one or two bookies, and I believe even
  Masters owes us a bit now."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Ruff said. "I think that I know everything now. My fee is
  five hundred guineas."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard looked at him.</p>

  <p>"What?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Five hundred guineas," Ruff repeated.</p>

  <p>"For a consultation?" Sir Richard asked.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"More than that," he said. "You are a brave man in your way, Sir Richard
  Dyson, but you are going about now shivering under a load of fear. It sits
  like a devil incarnate upon your shoulders. It poisons the air wherever you
  go. Write your cheque, Sir Richard, and you can leave that little black devil
  in my wastebasket. You are under my protection. Nothing will happen to
  you."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard sat like a man mesmerised. The little man with the amiable
  expression and the badly fitting suit was leaning back in his chair, his
  finger tips pressed together, waiting.</p>

  <p>"Nothing will happen!" Sir Richard repeated, incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not. I guarantee you against any inconvenience which might
  arise to you from this recent unfortunate affair. Isn't that all you
  want?"</p>

  <p>"It's all I want, certainly," Sir Richard declared, "but I must understand
  a little how you propose to secure my immunity."</p>

  <p>Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I have my own methods," he said. "I can help only those who trust
  me."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard drew a cheque book from his pocket. "I don't know why I should
  believe in you," he said, as he wrote the cheque.</p>

  <p>"But you do," Peter Ruff said, smiling. "Fortunately for you, you do!"</p>

  <p>It was not so easy to impart a similar confidence into the breast of
  Colonel Dickinson, with whom Sir Richard dined that night tete-a-tete.
  Dickinson was inclined to think that Sir Richard ad been "had."</p>

  <p>"You've paid a ridiculous fee," he argued, "and all that you have in
  return is the fellow's promise to see you through. It isn't like you to part
  with money so easily, Richard. Did he hypnotise you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," Sir Richard answered. "I wasn't conscious of it."</p>

  <p>"What sort of a fellow is he?" Dickinson asked.</p>

  <p>Sir Richard looked reflectively into his glass.</p>

  <p>"He's a vulgar sort of little Johnny," he said. "Looks as though he were
  always dressed in new clothes and couldn't get used to them."</p>

  <p>Three men entered the room. Two remained in the background. John Dory came
  forward towards the table.</p>

  <p>"Sir Richard Dyson," he said, gravely, "I have come upon an unpleasant
  errand."</p>

  <p>"Go on," Sir Richard said, fingering something hard inside pocket of his
  coat.</p>

  <p>"I have a warrant for your arrest," Dory continued, "in connection with
  the disappearance of Job Masters on Saturday, the 10th of November last. I
  will read the terms of the warrant, if you choose. It is my duty to warn you
  that anything you may now say can be used in evidence against you. This
  gentleman, I believe, is Colonel Dickinson?"</p>

  <p>"That is my name, sir," Dickinson answered, with unexpected fortitude.</p>

  <p>"I regret to say," the detective continued, "that I have also a warrant
  for your arrest in connection with the same matter."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard had hold of the butt end of his revolver then. Like grisly
  phantoms, the thoughts chased one another through his brain. Should he shoot
  and end it&mdash;pass into black nothingness&mdash;escape disgrace, but die
  like a rat in a corner? His finger was upon the trigger. Then suddenly his
  heart gave a great leap. He raised his head as though listening. Something
  flashed in his eyes&mdash;something that was almost like hope. There was no
  mistaking that voice which he had heard in the hall! He made a great
  rally.</p>

  <p>"I can only conclude," he said, turning to the detective, "that you have
  made some absurd blunder. If you really possess the warrants you speak of,
  however, Colonel Dickinson and I will accompany you wherever you choose."</p>

  <p>Then the door opened and Peter Ruff walked in, followed by Job Masters,
  whose head was still bandaged, and who seemed to have lost a little flesh and
  a lot of colour. Peter Ruff looked round apologetically. He seemed surprised
  not to find Sir Richard Dyson and Colonel Dickinson alone. He seemed more
  than ever surprised to recognize Dory.</p>

  <p>"I trust," he said smoothly, "that our visit is not inopportune. Sir
  Richard Dyson, I believe?" he continued, bowing&mdash;"my friend, Mr. Masters
  here, has consulted me as to the loss of a betting book, and we ventured to
  call to ask you, sir, if by any chance on his recent visit to your
  house&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"God in Heaven, it's Masters!" Dyson exclaimed. "It's Job Masters!"</p>

  <p>"That's me, sir," Masters admitted. "Mr. Ruff thought you might be able to
  help me find that book."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard swayed upon his feet. Then the blood rushed once more through
  his veins.</p>

  <p>"Your book's here in my cabinet, safe enough," he said. "You left it here
  after our luncheon that day. Where on earth have you been to, man?" he
  continued. "We want some money from you over Myopia."</p>

  <p>"I'll pay all right, sir," Masters answered. "Fact is, after our luncheon
  party I'm afraid I got a bit fuddled. I don't seem to remember much."</p>

  <p>He sat down a little heavily. Peter Ruff hastened to the table and took up
  a glass.</p>

  <p>"You will excuse me if I give him a little brandy, won't you, sir?" he
  said. "He's really not quite fit for getting about yet, but he was worrying
  about his book."</p>

  <p>"Give him all the brandy he can drink," Sir Richard answered.</p>

  <p>The detective's face had been a study. He knew Masters well enough by
  sight&mdash;there was no doubt about his identity! His teeth came together
  with an angry little click. He had made a mistake! It was a thing which would
  be remembered against him forever! It was as bad as his failure to arrest
  that young man at Daisy Villa.</p>

  <p>"Your visit, Masters," Sir Richard said, with a curious smile at the
  corners of his lips, "is, in some respects, a little opportune. About that
  little matter we were speaking of," he continued, turning towards the
  detective.</p>

  <p>"We have only to offer you our apologies, Sir Richard," Dory answered.</p>

  <p>Then he crossed the room and confronted Peter Ruff.</p>

  <p>"Do I understand, sir, that your name is Ruff&mdash;Peter Ruff?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"That is my name, sir," Peter Ruff admitted, pleasantly "Yours I believe,
  is Dory. We are likely to come across one another now and then, I suppose.
  Glad to know you."</p>

  <p>The detective stood quite still, and there was no geniality in his
  face.</p>

  <p>"I wonder&mdash;have we ever met before?" he asked, without removing his
  eyes from the other's face. Peter Ruff smiled.</p>

  <p>"Not professionally, at any rate," he answered. "I know that Scotland Yard
  you don't think much of us small fry, but we find out things sometimes!"</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you contradict all those rumours as to his disappearance?" the
  detective asked, pointing to where Job Masters was contentedly sipping his
  brandy and water.</p>

  <p>"I was acting for my client, and in my own interests," replied Peter. "It
  was surely no part of my duty to save you gentlemen at Scotland Yard from
  hunting up mare's nests!"</p>

  <p>John Dory went out, followed by his men. Sir Richard took Peter Ruff by
  the arm, and, leading him to the sideboard, mixed him a drink.</p>

  <p>"Peter Ruff," he said, "you're a clever scoundrel, but you've earned your
  five hundred guineas. Hang it, you're welcome to them! Is there anything else
  I can do for you?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff raised his glass and set it down again. Once more he eyed with
  admiration his client's well-turned out figure.</p>

  <p>"You might give me a letter to your tailors, Sir Richard," he begged.</p>

  <p>Sir Richard laughed outright&mdash;it was some time since he had
  laughed!</p>

  <p>"You shall have it, Peter Ruff," he declared, raising his glass&mdash;"and
  here's to you!"</p>

  <h2>III. VINCENT CAWDOR, COMMISSION AGENT<br>
  <small>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Nov
  1909</small></h2>

  <p class="first">For the second time since their new association, Peter Ruff
  had surprised that look upon his secretary's face. This time he wheeled
  around in his chair and addressed her.</p>

  <p>"My dear Violet," he said, "be frank with me. What is wrong?"</p>

  <p>Miss Brown turned to face her employer. Save for a greater demureness of
  expression and the extreme simplicity of her attire, she had changed very
  little since she had given up her life of comparative luxury to become Peter
  Ruff's secretary. There was a sort of personal elegance which clung to her,
  notwithstanding her strenuous attempts to dress for her part, except for
  which she looked precisely as a private secretary and typist should look. She
  even wore a black bow at the back of her hair.</p>

  <p>"I have not complained, have I?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Do not waste time," Peter Ruff said, coldly. "Proceed."</p>

  <p>"I have not enough to do," she said. "I do not understand why you refuse
  so many cases."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"I did not bring my talents into this business," he said, "to watch
  flirting wives, to ascertain the haunts of gay husbands, or to detect the
  pilferings of servants."</p>

  <p>"Anything is better than sitting still," she protested.</p>

  <p>"I do not agree with you," Peter Ruff said. "I like sitting still very
  much indeed&mdash;one has time to think. Is there anything else?"</p>

  <p>"Shall I really go on?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"By all means," he answered.</p>

  <p>"I have idea," she continued, "that you are subordinating your general
  interests to your secret enmity&mdash;to one man. You are waiting until you
  can find another case in which you are pitted against him."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes," Peter Ruff said, "your intelligence surprises me!"</p>

  <p>"I came to you," she continued, looking at him earnestly, "for two
  reasons. The personal one I will not touch upon. The other was my love of
  excitement. I have tried many things in life, as you know, Peter, but I have
  seemed to carry always with me the heritage of weariness. I thought that my
  position here would help me to fight against it."</p>

  <p>"You have seen me bring a corpse to life," Peter Ruff reminded her, a
  little aggrieved.</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"It was a month ago," she reminded him.</p>

  <p>"I can't do that sort of thing every day," he declared.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," she answered; "but you have refused four cases within the
  last five days."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff whistled softly to himself for several moments.</p>

  <p>"Seen anything of our new neighbour in the flat above?" he asked, with
  apparent irrelevance.</p>

  <p>Miss Brown looked across at him with upraised eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"I have been in the lift with him twice," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Fancy his appearance?" Ruff asked, casually.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least!" Violet answered. "I thought him a vulgar, offensive
  person!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff chuckled. He seemed immensely delighted.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Vincent Cawdor he calls himself, I believe," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I have no idea," Miss Brown declared. The subject did not appeal to
  her.</p>

  <p>"His name is on a small copper plate just over the letter-box," Ruff said.
  "Rather neat idea, by the bye. He calls himself a commission agent, I
  believe."</p>

  <p>Violet was suddenly interested. She realized, after all, that Mr. Vincent
  Cawdor might be a person of some importance.</p>

  <p>"What is a commission agent?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It might mean anything," he declared. "Never trust any one who is not a
  little more explicit as to his profession. I am afraid that this Mr. Vincent
  Cawdor, for instance, is a bad lot."</p>

  <p>"I am sure he is," Miss Brown declared.</p>

  <p>"Looks after a pretty girl, coughs in the lift&mdash;all that sort of
  thing, eh?" Peter Ruff asked.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Disgusting!" she exclaimed, with emphasis.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff sighed, and glanced at the clock. The existence of Mr. Vincent
  Cawdor seemed to pass out of his mind.</p>

  <p>"It is nearly one o'clock," he said. "Where do you usually lunch,
  Violet?"</p>

  <p>"It depends upon my appetite," she answered, carelessly. "Most often at an
  A B C."</p>

  <p>"To-day," Peter Ruff said, "you will be extravagant&mdash;at my
  expense."</p>

  <p>"I had a poor breakfast," Miss Brown remarked, complacently.</p>

  <p>"You will leave at once," Peter Ruff said, "and you will go to the French
  Cafe at the Milan. Get a table facing the courtyard, and towards the hotel
  side of the room. Keep your eyes open and tell me exactly what you see."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with parted lips. Her eyes were full of eager
  questioning.</p>

  <p>"Mere skirmishing," Peter Ruff continued, "but I think&mdash;yes, I think
  that it may lead to something."</p>

  <p>"Whom am I to watch?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Any one who looks interesting," Peter Ruff answered. "For instance, if
  this person Vincent Cawdor should be about."</p>

  <p>"He would recognize me!" she declared.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"One must hold the candle," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I decline to flirt with him," she declared. "Nothing would induce me to
  be pleasant to such an odious creature."</p>

  <p>"He will be too busy to attempt anything of the sort. Of course he may not
  be there. It may be the merest fancy on my part. At any rate, you may rely
  upon it that he will not make any overtures in a public place like the Milan.
  Mr. Vincent Cawdor may be a curious sort of person, but I do not fancy that
  he is a fool!"</p>

  <p>"Very well," Miss Brown said, "I will go."</p>

  <p>"Be back soon after three," Peter Ruff said. "I am going up to my room to
  do my exercises."</p>

  <p>"And afterwards?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I shall have my lunch sent in," he answered. "Don't hurry back, though. I
  shall not expect you till a quarter past three."</p>

  <p>It was a few minutes past that time when Miss Brown returned. Peter Ruff
  was sitting at his desk, looking as though he had never moved. He was
  absorbed by a book of patterns sent in by his new tailor, and he only glanced
  up when she entered the room.</p>

  <p>"Violet," he said, earnestly, "come in and sit down. I want to consult
  you. There is a new material here&mdash;a sort of mouse-coloured cheviot. I
  wonder whether it would suit me?"</p>

  <p>Violet was looking very handsome and a little flushed. She raised her veil
  and came over to his side.</p>

  <p>"Put that stupid book away, Peter," she said. "I want to tell you about
  the Milan."</p>

  <p>He leaned back in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he said. "I had forgotten! Was Mr. Vincent Cawdor there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" she answered, still a little breathless. "There was some one else
  there, too, in whom you are still more interested."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he said.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Vincent Cawdor," she continued, "came in alone. He looked just as
  objectionable as ever, and he stared at me till I nearly threw my wine glass
  at him."</p>

  <p>"He did not speak to you?" Peter Ruff asked.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid that he was going to," Miss Brown said, "but fortunately he
  met a friend who came to his table and lunched with him."</p>

  <p>"A friend," Ruff remarked. "Good! What was he like?"</p>

  <p>"Fair, slight, Teutonic," Miss Brown answered. "He wore thick spectacles,
  and his moustache was positively yellow."</p>

  <p>Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he said.</p>

  <p>"Towards the end of luncheon," she continued, "an American came up to
  them."</p>

  <p>"An American?" Peter Ruff interrupted. "How do you know that?"</p>

  <p>Miss Brown smiled.</p>

  <p>"He was clean-shaven and he wore neat clothes," she said. "He talked with
  an accent you could have cut with a knife and he had a Baedeker sticking out
  of his pocket. After luncheon, they all three went away to the smoking
  room."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"Anything else?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The girl smiled triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" she declared. "There was something else&mdash;something which I
  think you will find interesting. At the next table to me there was a
  man&mdash;alone. Can you guess who he was?"</p>

  <p>"John Dory," Ruff said, calmly.</p>

  <p>The girl was disappointed.</p>

  <p>"You knew!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"My dear Violet," he said, "I did not send you there on a fool's
  errand."</p>

  <p>"There is something doing, then?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"There is likely," he answered, grimly, "to be a great deal doing!"</p>

  <p>The two men who stood upon the hill, and Peter Ruff, who lay upon his
  stomach behind a huge boulder, looked upon a new thing.</p>

  <p>Far down in the valley from out of a black shed&mdash;the only sign of
  man's handiwork for many miles&mdash;it came&mdash;something grey at first,
  moving slowly as though being pushed down a slight incline, then afloat in
  the air, gathering speed&mdash;something between a torpedo with wings and a
  great prehistoric insect. Now and then it described strange circles, but
  mostly it came towards them as swift and as true as an arrow shot from a bow.
  The two men looked at one another&mdash;the shorter, to whose cheeks the
  Cumberland winds had brought no trace of colour, gave vent to a hoarse
  exclamation.</p>

  <p>"He's done it!" he growled.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" the other answered.</p>

  <p>Over their heads the thing wheeled, and seemed to stand still in the air.
  The beating of the engine was so faint that Peter Ruff from behind the
  boulder, could hear all that was said. A man leaned out from his seat&mdash;a
  man with wan cheeks but blazing eyes.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he said. "Take your glasses. There&mdash;due north&mdash;can you
  see a steeple?"</p>

  <p>The men turned their field glasses in the direction toward which the other
  pointed. "Yes!" they answered. "It is sixteen miles, as the crow flies, to
  Barnham Church&mdash;thirty-two miles there and back. Wait!"</p>

  <p>He swung round, dived till he seemed about to touch the hillside, then
  soared upwards and straight away. Peter Ruff took out his watch. The other
  two men gazed with fascinated eyes after the disappearing speck.</p>

  <p>"If he does it&mdash;" the shorter one muttered.</p>

  <p>"He will do it!" the other answered.</p>

  <p>He was back again before their eyes were weary of watching. Peter Ruff,
  from behind the boulder, closed his watch. Thirty-two miles in less than half
  an hour! The youth leaned from his seat.</p>

  <p>"Is it enough?" he asked, hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"It is enough!" the two men answered together. "We will come down."</p>

  <p>The youth touched a lever and the machine glided down towards the valley,
  falling all the while with the effortless grace a parachute. The shed from
  which his machine had issued was midway down a slope, with a short length of
  rails which ran, apparently, through it. The machine seemed to hover for
  several moments above the building, then descended slowly on to the rails and
  disappeared in the shed. The two men were already half-way down the hill.
  Peter Ruff rose from behind the boulder, stretched himself with a sense of
  immense relief, and lit a pipe. As yet he dared not descend. He simply
  changed his hiding place for a spot which enabled him to command a view of
  the handful of cottages at the back of the hill. He had plenty to think
  about. It was a wonderful thing&mdash;this&mdash;which he had seen!</p>

  <p>The youth, meanwhile, was drinking deep of the poisonous cup. He walked
  between the two men&mdash;his cheeks were flushed, his eyes on fire.</p>

  <p>"If all the world to-day had seen what we have seen," the older man was
  saying, "there would be no more talk of Wilbur Wrights or Farmans. Those men
  are babies, playing with their toys."</p>

  <p>"Mine is the ideal principle," the youth declared. "No one else has
  thought of it, no one else has made use of it. Yet all the time I am
  afraid&mdash;it is so simple."</p>

  <p>"Sell quick, then," the fair-headed man advised. "By to-morrow night I can
  promise you fifty thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>The youth stopped. He drew a deep breath.</p>

  <p>"I shall sell," he declared. "I need money. I want to live. Fifty thousand
  pounds is enough. Eleven weary months I have slept and toiled there in the
  shed."</p>

  <p>"It is finished," the older man declared. "To-night you shall come with us
  to London. To-morrow night your pockets shall be full of gold. It will be a
  change for you."</p>

  <p>The youth sobbed.</p>

  <p>"God knows it will," he muttered. "I haven't two shillings in the world,
  and I owe for my last petrol."</p>

  <p>The two men laughed heartily. The elder took a little bundle of notes from
  his pocket and handed them to the boy.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "not for another moment shall you feel as poor as that.
  Money will have no value for you in the future. The fifty thousand pounds
  will only be a start. After that, you will get royalties. If I had it, I
  would give you a quarter of a million now for your plans; I know that I can
  get you more."</p>

  <p>The youth laughed hysterically. They entered the tiny inn and drank
  home-made wine&mdash;the best they could get. Then a great car drew up
  outside, and the older&mdash;the clean-shaven man, who looked like an
  American&mdash;hurried out, and dragging a hamper from beneath the seat
  returned with a gold-foiled bottle in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "a toast! We have one bottle left&mdash;one bottle of the
  best!"</p>

  <p>"Champagne!" the youth cried eagerly, holding out his hand.</p>

  <p>"The only wine for the conquerors," the other declared, pouring it out
  into the thick tumblers. "Drink, all of you, to the Franklin Flying Machine,
  to the millions she will earn&mdash;to to-morrow night!"</p>

  <p>The youth drained his glass, watched it replenished, and drained it again.
  Then they went out to the car.</p>

  <p>"There is one thing yet to be done," he said. "Wait here for me."</p>

  <p>They waited whilst he climbed up toward the shed. The two men watched him.
  A little group of rustics stood open-mouthed around the great car. Then there
  was a little shout. From above their heads came the sound of a great
  explosion&mdash;red flames were leaping up from that black barn to the sky.
  The two men looked at one another. They rushed to the hill and met the youth
  descending.</p>

  <p>"What the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped them.</p>

  <p>"I dared not leave it here," he explained. "It would have been madness. I
  am perfectly certain that I have been watched during the last few days. I can
  build another in a week. I have the plans in my pocket for every part."</p>

  <p>The older man wiped the perspiration from his forehead.</p>

  <p>"You are sure&mdash;that you have the plans?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The youth struck himself on the chest.</p>

  <p>"They are here," he answered, "every one of them!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are right, then," the other man answered. "It gave me a turn,
  though. You are sure that you can make it again in the time you say?"</p>

  <p>"Of course!" the youth answered, impatiently. "Besides, the thing is so
  simple. It speaks for itself."</p>

  <p>They climbed into the car, and in a few minutes were rushing away
  southwards.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow night&mdash;to-morrow night it all begins!" the youth
  continued. "I must start with ready-made clothes. I'll get the best I can,
  eat the best I can, drink wine, go to the music halls. To-morrow night."</p>

  <p>His speech ended in a wail&mdash;a strange, half-stifled cry which rang
  out with a chill, ghostly sound upon the black silence. His face was covered
  with a wet towel, a ghastly odor was in his nostrils, his lips refused to
  utter any further sound. He lay back among the cushions, senseless. The car
  slowed down.</p>

  <p>"Get the papers, quick!" the elder man muttered, opening the youth's coat.
  "Here they are! Catch hold, Dick! My God! What's that?"</p>

  <p>He shook from head to foot. The little fair man looked at him with
  contempt.</p>

  <p>"A sheep bell on the moor," he said. "Are you sure you have
  everything?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" the other muttered.</p>

  <p>They both stood up and raised the prostrate form between them. Below them
  were the black waters of the lake.</p>

  <p>"Over with him!" the younger said. "Quick!"</p>

  <p>Once more his companion shrank away.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" he muttered, hoarsely.</p>

  <p>They both held their breaths. From somewhere along the road behind came a
  faint sound like the beating of an engine.</p>

  <p>"It's a car!" the elder man exclaimed. "Quick! Over with him!"</p>

  <p>They lifted the body of the boy, whose lips were white and speechless now,
  and threw him into the water. With a great splash he disappeared. They
  watched for a moment. Only the ripples flowed away from the place where he
  had sunk. They jumped back to their seats.</p>

  <p>"There's something close behind," the older man muttered. "Get on! Fast!
  Fast!"</p>

  <p>The younger man hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he said slowly, "it would be better to wait and see who it is
  coming up behind. Our young friend there is safe. The current has him, and
  the tarn is bottomless."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's indecision&mdash;a moment which was to count for much
  in the lives of three men. Then the elder one's counsels prevailed. They
  crept away down the hill, smoothly and noiselessly. Behind them, the faint
  throbbing grew less and less distinct. Soon they heard it no more. They drove
  into the dawn and through the long day.</p>

  <p>Side by side on one of the big leather couches in the small smoking room
  of the Milan Hotel, Mr. James P. Rounceby and his friend Mr. Richard Marnstam
  sat whispering together. It was nearly two o clock, and they were alone in
  the room. Some of the lights had been turned out. The roar of life in the
  streets without had ceased. It was an uneasy hour for those whose consciences
  were not wholly at rest!</p>

  <p>The two men were in evening dress&mdash;Rounceby in dinner coat and black
  tie, as befitted his role of travelling American. The glasses in front of
  them were only half-filled, and had remained so for the last hour. Their
  conversation had been nervous and spasmodic. It was obvious that they were
  waiting for some one.</p>

  <p>Three o'clock struck by the little timepiece on the mantel shelf. A little
  exclamation of a profane nature broke from Rounceby's lips. He leaned toward
  his companion.</p>

  <p>"Say," he muttered, in a rather thick undertone, "how about this fellow
  Vincent Cawdor? You haven't any doubts about him, I suppose? He's on the
  square, all right, eh?"</p>

  <p>Marnstam wet his lips nervously.</p>

  <p>"Cawdor's all right," he said. "I had it direct from headquarters at
  Paris. What are you uneasy about, eh?"</p>

  <p>Rounceby pointed towards the clock.</p>

  <p>"Do you see the time?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He said he'd be late," Marnstam answered.</p>

  <p>Rounceby put his hand to his forehead and found it moist.</p>

  <p>"It's been a silly game, all along," he muttered. "We'd better have
  brought the young ass up here and jostled him!"</p>

  <p>"Not so easy," Marnstam answered. "These young fools have a way of turning
  obstinate. He'd have chucked us, sure. Anyhow, he's safer where he is."</p>

  <p>They relapsed once more into silence. A storm of rain beat upon the
  window. Rounceby glanced up. It was as black out there as were the waters of
  that silent tarn! The man shivered as the thought struck him. Marnstam, who
  had no nerves, twirled his moustache and watched his companion with
  wonder.</p>

  <p>"You look as though you saw a ghost," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I do!" Rounceby growled.</p>

  <p>"You had better finish your drink, my dear fellow," Marnstam advised.
  "Afterwards&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he stiffened into attention. He laid his hand upon his
  companion's knee.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" he said. "There is some one coming."</p>

  <p>They leaned a little forward. The swing doors were opened. A girl's
  musical laugh rang out from the corridor. Tall and elegant, with her black
  lace skirt trailing upon the floor, her left hand resting upon the shoulder
  of the man into whose ear she was whispering, and whom she led straight to
  one of the writing tables, Miss Violet Brown swept into the room. On her
  right, and nearest to the two men, was Mr. Vincent Cawdor.</p>

  <p>"Now you can go and talk to your friends!" she exclaimed, lightly. "I am
  going to make Victor listen to me."</p>

  <p>Cawdor left his two companions and sank on to the couch by Rounceby's
  side. The young man, with his opera hat still on his head, and the light
  overcoat which he had been carrying on the floor by his side, was seated
  before the writing table with his back to them. Miss Brown was leaning over
  him, with her hand upon the back of his chair. They were out of hearing of
  the other three men.</p>

  <p>"Well, Rounceby, my friend," Mr. Vincent Cawdor remarked, cheerfully,
  "you're having a late sitting, eh?"</p>

  <p>"We've been waiting for you, you fool!" Rounceby answered. "What on earth
  are you thinking about, bringing a crowd like this about with you, eh?"</p>

  <p>Cawdor smiled, reassuringly.</p>

  <p>"Don't you worry," he said, in a lower tone. "I know my way in and out of
  the ropes here better than you can teach me. A big hotel like this is the
  safest and the most dangerous place in the world&mdash;just how you choose to
  make it. You've got to bluff 'em all the time. That's why I brought the young
  lady&mdash;particular friend of mine&mdash;real nice girl, too!"</p>

  <p>"And the young man?" Rounceby asked, suspiciously.</p>

  <p>Cawdor grew more serious.</p>

  <p>"That's Captain Lowther," he said softly&mdash;"private secretary to
  Colonel Dean, who's the chief of the aeronaut department at Aldershot. He has
  a draft in his pocket for twenty thousand pounds. It is yours if he is
  satisfied with the plans."</p>

  <p>"Twenty thousand pounds!" Marnstam said, thoughtfully. "It is very
  little&mdash;very little indeed for the risks which we have run!"</p>

  <p>Cawdor moved his place and sat between the men. He laid a hand upon
  Marnstam's shoulder&mdash;another on Rounceby's knee.</p>

  <p>"My dear friends," he said, impressively, "if you could have built a
  model, or conducted these negotiations in the usual way, you might have asked
  a million. As it is, I think I am the only man in England who could have
  dealt with this matter&mdash;so satisfactorily."</p>

  <p>Rounceby glanced suspiciously at the young man to whom Miss Brown was
  still devoting the whole of her attention.</p>

  <p>"Why don't he come out and talk like a man?" he asked. "What's the idea of
  his sitting over there with his back to us?"</p>

  <p>"I want him never to see your faces&mdash;to deal only with me," Cawdor
  explained. "Remember that he is in an official position. The money he is
  going to part with is secret service money."</p>

  <p>The two men were beginning to be more reassured. Rounceby slowly produced
  a roll of oilskin from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"He'll look at them as he sits there," he insisted. "There must be no
  copying or making notes, mind."</p>

  <p>Cawdor smiled in a superior fashion.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he said, "you are dealing with the emissary of a
  government&mdash;not one of your own sort."</p>

  <p>Rounceby glanced at his companion, who nodded. Then he handed over the
  plans.</p>

  <p>"Tell him to look sharp," he said. "It's not so late but that there may be
  people in here yet."</p>

  <p>Cawdor crossed the room with the plans, and laid them down before the
  writing table. Rounceby rose to his feet and lit a cigar. Marnstam walked to
  the further window and back again. They stood side by side. Rounceby's whole
  frame seemed to have stiffened with some new emotion.</p>

  <p>"There's something wrong, Jim," Marnstam whispered softly in his ear.
  "You've got the old lady in your pocket?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Rounceby answered thickly, "and, by Heavens, I'm going to use
  it!"</p>

  <p>"Don't shoot unless it's the worst," Marnstam counselled. "I shall go out
  of that window, into the tree, and run for the river. But bluff first,
  Jim&mdash;bluff for your life!"</p>

  <p>There were swinging doors leading into the room from the hotel side, and a
  small door exactly opposite which led to the residential part of the place.
  Both of these doors were opened at precisely the same moment. Through the
  former stepped two strong looking men in long overcoats, and with the
  unmistakable appearance of policemen in plain clothes. Through the latter
  came John Dory! He walked straight up to the two men. It spoke volumes for
  his courage that, knowing their characters and believing them to be in
  desperate straits, he came unarmed.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he said, "I hold warrants for your arrest. I will not trouble
  you with your aliases. You are known to-day, I believe, as James Rounceby and
  Richard Marnstam. Will you come quietly?"</p>

  <p>Marnstam's expression was one of bland and beautiful surprise.</p>

  <p>"My dear sir," he said, edging, however, a little toward the
  window&mdash;"you must be joking! What is the charge?"</p>

  <p>"You are charged with the wilful murder of a young man named Victor
  Franklin," answered Dory. "His body was recovered from Longthorp Tarn this
  afternoon. You had better say nothing. Also with the theft of certain papers
  known to have been in his possession."</p>

  <p>Now it is possible that at this precise moment Marnstam would have made
  his spring for the window and Rounceby his running fight for liberty. The
  hands of both men were upon their revolvers, and John Dory's life was a thing
  of no account. But at this juncture a thing happened. There were in the room
  the two policemen guarding the swing doors, and behind them the pale faces of
  a couple of night porters looking anxiously in. Vincent Cawdor and Miss Brown
  were standing side by side, a little in the background, and the young man who
  had been their companion had risen also to his feet. As though with some
  intention of intervening, he moved a step forward, almost in line with Dory.
  Rounceby saw him, and a new fear gripped him by the heart. He shrank back,
  his fingers relaxed their hold of his weapon, the sweat was hot upon his
  forehead. Marnstam, though he seemed for a moment stupefied, realised the
  miracle which had happened and struck boldly for his own.</p>

  <p>"If this is a joke," he said, "it strikes me as being a particularly bad
  one. I should like to know, sir, how you dare to come into this room and
  charge me and my friend&mdash;Mr. Rounceby&mdash;with being concerned in the
  murder of a young man who is even now actually standing by your side."</p>

  <p>John Dory started back. He looked with something like apprehension at the
  youth to whom Marnstam pointed.</p>

  <p>"My name is Victor Franklin," that young man declared. "What's all this
  about?"</p>

  <p>Dory felt the ground give beneath his feet. Nevertheless, he set his teeth
  and fought for his hand.</p>

  <p>"You say that your name is Victor Franklin?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly!"</p>

  <p>"You are the inventor of a flying machine?"</p>

  <p>"I am."</p>

  <p>"You were in Westmoreland with these two men a few days go?"</p>

  <p>"I was," the young man admitted.</p>

  <p>"You left the village of Scawton in a motor car with them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! We quarrelled on the way, and parted."</p>

  <p>"You were robbed of nothing?"</p>

  <p>Victor Franklin smiled.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," he answered. "I had nothing worth stealing except my
  plans, and they are in my pocket now."</p>

  <p>There was a few moments' intense silence. Dory wheeled suddenly round, and
  looked to where Mr. Vincent Cawdor had been standing.</p>

  <p>"Where is Mr. Cawdor?" he asked, sharply.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman with the grey moustache left a few seconds ago," one of the
  men at the door said. Dory was very pale.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he said, "I have to offer you my apologies. I have apparently
  been deceived by some false information. The charge is withdrawn."</p>

  <p>He turned on his heel and left the room. The two policemen followed
  him.</p>

  <p>"Keep them under observation," Dory ordered shortly, "but I am afraid this
  fellow Cawdor has sold me."</p>

  <p>He found a hansom outside, and sprang into it.</p>

  <p>"Number 27, Southampton Row," he ordered.</p>

  <p>Rounceby and his partner were alone in the little smoking room. The former
  was almost inarticulate. The night porter brought them brandy, and both men
  drank.</p>

  <p>"We've got to get to the bottom of this, Marnstam," Mr. Rounceby
  muttered.</p>

  <p>Mr. Marnstam was thinking.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember that sound through the darkness," he said&mdash;"the
  beating of an engine way back on the road?"</p>

  <p>"What of it?" Rounceby demanded.</p>

  <p>"It was a motor bicycle," Marnstam said quietly. "I thought so at the
  time."</p>

  <p>"Supposing some one followed us and pulled him out," Rounceby said,
  hoarsely, "why are we treated like this? I tell you we've been made fools of!
  We've been treated like children&mdash;not even to be punished! We'll have
  the truth somehow out of that devil Cawdor! Come!"</p>

  <p>They made their way to the courtyard and found a cab.</p>

  <p>"Number 27, Southampton Row!" they ordered.</p>

  <p>They reached their destination some time before Dory, whose horse fell
  down in the Strand, and who had to walk. They ascended to the fourth floor of
  the building and rang the bell of Vincent Cawdor's room&mdash;no answer. They
  plied the knocker&mdash;no result. Rounceby peered through the keyhole.</p>

  <p>"He hasn't come home yet," he remarked. "There is no light anywhere in the
  place."</p>

  <p>The door of a flat across the passage was quietly opened. Mr. Peter Ruff,
  in a neat black smoking suit and slippers, and holding a pipe in his hand,
  looked out.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, gentlemen," he said, "but I do not think that Mr. Cawdor is
  in. He went out early this evening, and I have not heard him return."</p>

  <p>The two men turned away.</p>

  <p>"We are much obliged to you, sir," Mr. Marnstam said.</p>

  <p>"Can I give him any message?" Peter Ruff asked, politely. "We generally
  see something of one another in the morning."</p>

  <p>"You can tell him&mdash;" Rounceby began.</p>

  <p>"No message, thanks!" Marnstam interrupted. "We shall probably run across
  him ourselves to-morrow."</p>

  <p>John Dory was nearly a quarter of an hour late. After his third useless
  summons, Mr. Peter Ruff presented himself again.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, "you will not find my neighbour at home. There
  have been several people enquiring for him to-night, without any result."</p>

  <p>John Dory came slowly across the landing.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Mr. Ruff!" he said.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's Mr. Dory!" Peter Ruff declared. "Come in, do, and have a
  drink."</p>

  <p>John Dory accepted the invitation, and his eyes were busy in that little
  sitting room during the few minutes which it took his host to mix that whisky
  and soda.</p>

  <p>"Nothing wrong with our friend opposite, I hope?" Peter Ruff asked,
  jerking his head across the landing.</p>

  <p>"I hope not, Mr. Ruff," John Dory said. "No doubt in the morning he will
  be able to explain everything. I must say that I should like to see him
  to-night, though."</p>

  <p>"He may turn up yet," Peter Ruff remarked, cheerfully. "He's like
  myself&mdash;a late bird."</p>

  <p>"I fear not," Dory answered, drily. "Nice rooms you have here, sir. Just a
  sitting room and bedroom, eh?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff stood up and threw open the door of the inner apartment.</p>

  <p>"That's so," he answered. "Care to have a look round?"</p>

  <p>The detective did look round, and pretty thoroughly. As soon as he was
  sure that there was no one concealed upon the premises, he drank his whisky
  and soda and went.</p>

  <p>"I'll look in again to see Cawdor," he remarked&mdash;"to-morrow, perhaps,
  or the next day."</p>

  <p>"I'll let him know if I see him about," Peter Ruff declared. "Sorry the
  lift's stopped. Three steps to the left and straight on. Good-night!"</p>

  <p>Miss Brown arrived early the following morning, and was disposed to be
  inquisitive.</p>

  <p>"I should like to know," she said, "exactly what has become of Mr. Vincent
  Cawdor."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff took her upstairs. There was a little mound of ashes in the
  grate.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I imagined that," she said. "But why did you send me out to watch
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Violet," Peter Ruff answered, "there is no man in the world
  to-day who is my equal in the art of disguising himself. At the same time, I
  wanted to know whether I could deceive you. I wanted to be quite sure that my
  study of Mr. Vincent Cawdor was a safe one. I took those rooms in his name
  and in his own person. I do not think that it occurred even to our friend
  John Dory to connect us in his mind."</p>

  <p>"Very well," she went on. "Now tell me, please, what took you up to
  Westmoreland?"</p>

  <p>"I followed Rounceby and Marnstam," he answered, "I knew them when I was
  abroad, studying crime&mdash;I could tell you a good deal about both those
  men if it were worth while&mdash;and I knew, when they hired a big motor car
  and engaged a crook to drive it, that they were worth following. I saw the
  trial of the flying machine, and when they started off with young Franklin, I
  followed on a motor bicycle. I fished him out of the tarn where they left him
  for dead, brought him on to London, and made my own terms with him."</p>

  <p>"What about the body which was found in the Longthorp Tarn?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I had that telegram sent myself," Peter Ruff answered.</p>

  <p>She looked at him severely.</p>

  <p>"You went out of your way to make a fool of John Dory!" she said, frowning
  at him.</p>

  <p>"That I admit," he answered.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," she continued, "that that, after all, has been the chief
  object of the whole affair. I do not see that we&mdash;that is the
  firm&mdash;profit in the least."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff chuckled.</p>

  <p>"We've got a fourth share in the Franklin Flying Machine," he answered,
  "and I'm hanged if I'd sell it for a hundred thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"You've taken advantage of that young man's gratitude," she declared.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I earned the money," he answered.</p>

  <h2>IV. THE INDISCRETION OF LETTY SHAW<br>
  <small>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Dec
  1909</small></h2>

  <p class="first">Amidst a storm of whispered criticisms, the general opinion
  was that Letty Shaw was a silly little fool who ought to have known better.
  When she had entered the restaurant a few minutes before midnight, followed
  by Austen Abbott, every one looked to see a third person following them. No
  third person, however, appeared. Gustav himself conducted them to a small
  table laid for two, covered with pink roses, and handed his fair client the
  menu of a specially ordered supper. There was no gainsaying the fact that
  Letty and her escort proposed supping alone!</p>

  <p>The Cafe at the Milan was, without doubt, the fashionable rendezvous of
  the moment for those ladies connected with the stage who, after their
  performance, had not the time or the inclination to make the conventional
  toilet demanded by the larger restaurants. Letty Shaw, being one of the
  principal ornaments of the musical comedy stage, was well known to every one
  in the room. There was scarcely a person there who within the last fortnight
  had not found an opportunity of congratulating her upon her engagement to
  Captain the Honourable Brian Sotherst. Sotherst was rich, and one of the most
  popular young men about town. Letty Shaw, although she had had one or two
  harmless flirtations, was well known as a self-respecting and hard-working
  young actress who loved her work, and against whom no one had ever had a word
  to say. Consequently, the shock was all the greater when, within a fortnight
  of her engagement, she was thus to be seen openly supping alone with the most
  notorious woman hunter about town&mdash;a man of bad reputation, a man, too,
  towards whom Sotherst was known to have a special aversion. Nothing but a
  break with Sotherst or a fit of temporary insanity seemed to explain, even
  inadequately, the situation.</p>

  <p>Her best friend&mdash;the friend who knew her and believed in
  her&mdash;rose to her feet and came sailing down the room. She nodded gaily
  to Abbott, whom she hated, and whom she had not recognized for years, and
  laid her hand upon Letty's arm.</p>

  <p>"Where's Brian?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Letty shrugged her shoulders&mdash;it was not altogether a natural
  gesture.</p>

  <p>"On duty to-night," she answered.</p>

  <p>Her best friend paused for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Come over and join our party, both of you," she said. "Dicky Pennell's
  here and Gracie Marsh&mdash;just landed. They'd love to meet you."</p>

  <p>Letty shook her head slowly. There was a look in her face which even her
  best friend did not understand.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that we can't do that," she said. "I am Mr. Abbott's
  guest."</p>

  <p>"And to-night," Austen Abbott intervened, looking up at the woman who
  stood between them, "I am not disposed to share Miss Shaw with anybody."</p>

  <p>Her best friend could do no more than shake her head and go away. The two
  were left alone for the rest of the evening. When they departed together,
  people who knew felt that a whiff of tragedy had passed through the room.
  Nobody understood&mdash;or pretended to understand. Even before her
  engagement, Letty had never been known to sup alone with a man. That she
  should do so now, and with this particular man, was preposterous!</p>

  <p>"Something will come of it," her best friend murmured, sadly, as she
  watched Austen Abbott help his companion on with her cloak.</p>

  <p>Something did!</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff rose at his accustomed time the following morning, and attired
  himself, if possible, with more than his usual care. He wore the grey suit
  which he had carefully put out the night before, but he hesitated long
  between the rival appeals of a red tie with white spots and a plain mauve
  one. He finally chose the latter, finding that it harmonised more
  satisfactorily with his socks, and after a final survey of himself in the
  looking-glass, he entered the next room, where his coffee was set out upon a
  small round table near the fire, together with his letters and
  newspapers.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff was, after all, like the rest of us, a creature of habit. He
  made an invariable rule of glancing through the newspapers before he paid any
  regard at all to his letters or his breakfast. In the absence of anything of
  a particularly sensational character, he then opened his letters in leisurely
  fashion, and went back afterwards to the newspaper as he finished his meal.
  This morning, however, both his breakfast and letters remained for some time
  untouched. The first paragraph which caught his eye as he shook open the
  Daily Telegraph was sufficiently absorbing. There it was in great black
  type:</p>
  <pre>
      TERRIBLE TRAGEDY IN THE FLAT OF A WELL-KNOWN ACTRESS!
                   AUSTEN ABBOTT SHOT DEAD!
                  ARREST OF CAPTAIN SOTHERST
</pre>

  <p>Beyond the inevitable shock which is always associated with the taking of
  life, and the unusual position of the people concerned in it, there was
  little in the brief account of the incident to excite the imagination. A
  policeman on the pavement outside the flat in which Miss Shaw and her mother
  lived fancied that he heard, about two o'clock in the morning, the report of
  a revolver shot. As nothing further transpired, and as the sound was very
  indistinct, he did not at once enter the building, but kept it, so far as
  possible, under observation. About twenty minutes later, a young gentleman in
  evening dress came out into the street, and the policeman noticed at once
  that he was carrying a small revolver, which he attempted to conceal. The
  constable thereupon whistled for his sergeant, and accompanied by the young
  gentleman&mdash;who made no effort to escape&mdash;ascended to Miss Shaw's
  rooms, where the body of Austen Abbott was discovered lying upon the
  threshold of the sitting room with a small bullet mark through the forehead.
  The inmates of the house were aroused and a doctor sent for. The deceased man
  was identified as Austen Abbott&mdash;a well-known actor&mdash;and the man
  under arrest gave his name at once as Captain the Honourable Brian Sotherst.
  Peter Ruff sighed as he laid down the paper. The case seemed to him perfectly
  clear, and his sympathies were altogether with the young officer who had
  taken the law into his own hands. He knew nothing of Miss Letty Shaw, and,
  consequently, did her, perhaps, less than justice in his thoughts. Of Austen
  Abbott, on the other hand, he knew a great deal&mdash;and nothing of good. It
  was absurd, after all, that any one should be punished for killing such a
  brute!</p>

  <p>He descended, a few minutes later, to his office, and found Miss Brown
  busy arranging a bowl of violets upon his desk.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it horrible?" she cried, as he entered, carrying a bundle of papers
  under his arm. "I never have had such a shock!"</p>

  <p>"Do you know any of them, then?" Peter Ruff asked, straightening his tie
  in the mirror.</p>

  <p>"Of course!" she answered. "Why, I was in the same company as Letty Shaw
  for a year. I was at the Milan, too, last night. Letty was there having
  supper alone with Austen Abbott. We all said that there'd be trouble, but of
  course we never dreamed of this! Isn't there any chance for him, Peter? Can't
  he get off?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not," he answered. "They may be able to bring evidence of a
  quarrel and reduce it to manslaughter, but what you've just told me about
  this supper party makes it all the worse. It will come out in the evidence,
  of course."</p>

  <p>"Captain Sotherst is such a dear," Miss Brown declared, "and so
  good-looking! And as for that brute Austen Abbott, he ought to have been shot
  long ago!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff seated himself before his desk and hitched up his trousers at
  the knees.</p>

  <p>"No doubt you are right, Violet," he said, "but people go about these
  things so foolishly. To me it is simply exasperating to reflect how little
  use is made of persons such as myself, whose profession in life it is to
  arrange these little matters. Take the present case, for example. Captain
  Sotherst had only to lay these facts before me, and Austen Abbott was a
  ruined man. I could have arranged the affair for him in half-a-dozen
  different ways. Whereas now it must be a life for a life&mdash;the life of an
  honest young English gentleman for that of a creature who should have been
  kicked out of the world as vermin!... I have some letters give you, Violet,
  if you please."</p>

  <p>She swung round in her chair reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"I can't help thinking of that poor young fellow," she said, with a
  sigh.</p>

  <p>"Sentiment after office hours, if you please!" said Peter.</p>

  <p>Then there came a knock at the door.</p>

  <p>His visitor lifted her veil, and Peter Ruff recognized her
  immediately.</p>

  <p>"What can I do for you, Lady Mary?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She saw the recognition in his eyes even before he spoke, and wondered at
  it.</p>

  <p>"You know me?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I know most people," he answered, drily; "it is part of my
  profession."</p>

  <p>"Tell me&mdash;you are Mr. Peter Ruff," she said, "the famous specialist
  in the detection of crime? You know that Brian Sotherst is my brother?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "I know it! I am sorry&mdash;very sorry, indeed."</p>

  <p>He handed her a chair. She seated herself with a little tightening of the
  lips.</p>

  <p>"I want more than sympathy from you, Mr. Ruff," she warned him. "I want
  your help."</p>

  <p>"It is my profession," he admitted, "but your brother's case makes
  intervention difficult, does it not?"</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"Your brother himself does not deny his guilt, I understand."</p>

  <p>"He has not denied it," she answered&mdash;"very likely he will not do so
  before the magistrate&mdash;but neither has he admitted it. Mr. Ruff, you are
  such a clever man. Can't you see the truth?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff looked at her steadily for several moments.</p>

  <p>"Lady Mary," he said, "I can see what you are going to suggest. You are
  going on the assumption that Austen Abbott was shot by Letty Shaw and that
  your brother is taking the thing on his shoulders."</p>

  <p>"I am sure of it!" she declared. "The girl did it herself, beyond a doubt.
  Brian would never have shot any one. He might have horsewhipped him,
  perhaps&mdash;even beaten him to death&mdash;but shot him in cold
  blood&mdash;never!"</p>

  <p>"The provocation&mdash;" Ruff began.</p>

  <p>"There was no provocation," she interrupted. "He was engaged to the girl,
  and of course we hated it, but she was an honest little thing, and devoted to
  him."</p>

  <p>"Doubtless," Ruff admitted. "But all the same, as you will hear before the
  magistrates, or at the inquest, she was having supper alone with Austen
  Abbott that night at the Milan."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it!" she declared.</p>

  <p>"It is nevertheless true," Peter Ruff assured her. "There is no shadow of
  doubt about it."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary was staggered. For a few moment she seemed struggling to
  rearrange her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"You see," Ruff continued, "the fact that Miss Shaw was willing to sup
  with Austen Abbott tete-a-tete renders it more improbable that she should
  shoot him in her sitting room, an hour or so later, and then go calmly up to
  her mother's room as though nothing had happened."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary had lost some of her confidence, but she was not daunted.</p>

  <p>"Even if we have been deceived in the girl," she said,
  thoughtfully&mdash;"even if she were disposed to flirt with other
  men&mdash;even then there might be a stronger motive than ever for her
  wishing to get rid of Abbott. He may have become jealous, and threatened
  her."</p>

  <p>"It is, of course, possible," Ruff assented, politely. "Your theory would,
  at any rate, account for your brother's present attitude."</p>

  <p>She looked at him steadfastly.</p>

  <p>"You believe, then," she said, "that my brother shot Austen Abbott?"</p>

  <p>"I do," he admitted frankly. "So does every man or woman of common sense
  in London. On the facts as they are stated in the newspapers, with the
  addition of which I have told you, no other conclusion is possible."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary rose.</p>

  <p>"Then I may as well go," she said tearfully.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," Peter Ruff declared. "Listen. This is a matter of business
  with me. I say that on the facts as they are known, your brother's guilt
  appears indubitable. I do not say that there may not be other facts in the
  background which alter the state of affairs. If you wish me to search for
  them, engage me, and I will do my best."</p>

  <p>"Isn't that what I am here for?" the girl exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Very well," Peter Ruff said. "My services are at your disposal."</p>

  <p>"You will do your best&mdash;more than your best, won't you?" she begged.
  "Remember that he is my brother&mdash;my favourite brother!"</p>

  <p>"I will do what can be done," Peter Ruff promised. "Please sit down at
  that desk and write me two letters of introduction."</p>

  <p>She drew off her gloves and prepared to obey him.</p>

  <p>"To whom?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"To the solicitors who are defending your brother," he said, "and to Miss
  Letty Shaw."</p>

  <p>"You mean to go and see her?" Lady Mary asked, doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," Peter Ruff answered. "If your supposition is correct, she
  might easily give herself away under a little subtle cross-examination. It is
  my business to know how to ask people questions in such a way that if they do
  not speak the truth their words give some indication of it. If she is
  innocent I shall know that I have to make my effort in another
  direction."</p>

  <p>"What other direction can there be?" Lady Mary asked dismally.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff said nothing. He was too kind-hearted to kindle false
  hopes.</p>

  <p>"It's a hopeless case, of course," Miss Brown remarked, after Lady Mary
  had departed.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid so," Peter Ruff answered. "Still I must earn my money. Please
  get some one to take you to supper to-night at the Milan, and see if you can
  pick up any scandal."</p>

  <p>"About Letty?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"About either of them," he answered. "Particularly I should like to know
  if any explanation has cropped up of her supping alone with Austen
  Abbott."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why you can't take me yourself," she remarked. "You are on
  the side of the law this time, at any rate."</p>

  <p>"I will," he answered, after a moment's hesitation. "I will call for you
  at eleven o'clock to-night."</p>

  <p>He rose and closed his desk emphatically.</p>

  <p>"You are going out?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I am going to see Miss Letty Shaw," he answered.</p>

  <p>He took a taxicab to the flats, and found a handful of curious people
  still gazing up at the third floor. The parlourmaid who answered his summons
  was absolutely certain that Miss Shaw would not see him. He persuaded her,
  after some difficulty, to take in his letter while he waited in the hall.
  When she returned, she showed him into a small sitting room and pulled down
  the blinds.</p>

  <p>"Miss Shaw will see you, sir, for a few minutes," she announced, in a
  subdued tone. "Poor dear young lady," she continued, "she has been crying her
  eyes out all the morning."</p>

  <p>"No wonder," Peter Ruff said, sympathetically. "It's a terrible business,
  this!"</p>

  <p>"One of the nicest young men as ever walked," the girl declared, firmly.
  "As for that brute, he deserved all he's got, and more!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff was left alone for nearly a quarter of an hour. Then the door
  was softly opened and Letty Shaw entered. There was no doubt whatever about
  her suffering. Ruff, who had seen her only lately at the theatre, was
  shocked. Under her eyes were blacker lines than her pencil had ever traced.
  Not only was she ghastly pale, but her face seemed wan and shrunken. She
  spoke to him the moment she entered, leaning with on hand upon the
  sideboard.</p>

  <p>"Lady Mary writes that you want to help us," she said. "How can you? How
  is it possible?"</p>

  <p>Even her voice had gone. She spoke hoarsely, and as though short of
  breath. Her eyes searched his face feverishly. It seemed cruelty not to
  answer her at once, and Peter Ruff was not a cruel man. Nevertheless, he
  remained silent, and it seemed to her that his eyes were like points of fire
  upon her face.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" she cried, with breaking voice. "What have you come
  for? Why don't you speak to me?"</p>

  <p>"Madam," Peter Ruff said, "I should like to help you, and I will do what I
  can. But in order that I may do so, it is necessary that you should answer me
  two questions&mdash;truthfully!"</p>

  <p>Her eyes grew wider. It was the face of a terrified child.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she exclaimed. "What have I to conceal?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff's expression never changed. There was nothing about him, as he
  stood there with his hands behind him, his head thrown a little forward, in
  the least inspiring&mdash;nothing calculated to terrify the most timid
  person. Yet the girl looked at him with the eyes of a frightened bird.</p>

  <p>"Remember, then," he continued, smoothly, "that what you say to me is
  sacred. You and I are alone without witnesses or eavesdroppers. Was it Brian
  Sotherst who shot Abbott&mdash;or was it you?"</p>

  <p>She gave a little cry. Her hands clasped the sides of her head in
  horror.</p>

  <p>"I!" she exclaimed, "I! God help me!"</p>

  <p>He waited. In a moment she looked up.</p>

  <p>"You cannot believe that," she said, with a calmness for which he was
  scarcely prepared. "It is absurd. I left the room by the inner door as he
  took up his hat to step out into the hall."</p>

  <p>"Incidentally," he asked&mdash;"this is not my other question,
  mind&mdash;why did you not let him out yourself?"</p>

  <p>"We had disagreed," she answered, curtly.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff bent his head in assent.</p>

  <p>"I see," he remarked. "You had disagreed. Abbott probably hoped that you
  would relent, so he waited for a few minutes. Brian Sotherst, who had escaped
  from his engagement in time, he thought, to come and wish you good night,
  must have walked in and found him there. By the bye, how would Captain
  Sotherst get in?"</p>

  <p>"He had a key," the girl answered. "My mother lives here with me, and we
  have only one maid. It was more convenient. I gave him one washed in gold for
  a birthday present only a few days ago."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Peter Ruff said. "The revolver, I understand, was your
  property?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"It was a present from Brian," she said. "He gave it to me in a joke, and
  I had it on the table with some other curiosities."</p>

  <p>"The first question," Peter Ruff said, "is disposed of. May I proceed to
  the second?"</p>

  <p>The girl moistened her lips.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" she answered.</p>

  <p>"Why did you sup alone with Austen Abbott last night?"</p>

  <p>She shrank a little away.</p>

  <p>"Why should I not?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You have been on the stage, my dear Miss Shaw," Peter Ruff continued,
  "for between four and five years. During the whole of that time, it has been
  your very wise habit to join supper parties, of course, when the company was
  agreeable to you, but to sup alone with no man! Am I not right?"</p>

  <p>"You seem to know a great deal about me," she faltered.</p>

  <p>"Am I not right?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"You break your rule for the first time," Peter Ruff continued, "in favour
  of a man of notoriously bad character, a few weeks after the announcement of
  your engagement to an honourable young English gentleman. You know very well
  the construction likely to be put upon your behaviour&mdash;you, of all
  people, would be the most likely to appreciate the risk you ran. Why did you
  run it? In other words, I repeat my question. Why did you sup alone with
  Austen Abbott last night?"</p>

  <p>All this time she had been standing. She came a little forward now, and
  threw herself into an easy-chair.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't help!" she exclaimed. "All this doesn't help!"</p>

  <p>"Nor can I help you, then," Peter Ruff said, stretching out his hand for
  his hat.</p>

  <p>She waved to him to put it down.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you," she said. "It has nothing to do with the case, but
  since you ask, you shall know. There is a dear little girl in our
  company&mdash;Fluffy Dean we all call her&mdash;only eighteen years old. We
  all love her, she is so sweet, and just like I was when I first went on the
  stage, only much nicer. She is very pretty, she has no money, and she is such
  an affectionate little dear that although she is as good as gold, we are all
  terrified for her sake whenever she makes acquaintances. Several of us who
  are most interested made a sort of covenant. We all took it in turns to look
  after her, and try to see that she did not meet any one she shouldn't. Yet,
  for all our precautions, Austen Abbott got hold of her and turned her silly
  little head. He was a man of experience, and she was only a child. She
  wouldn't listen to us&mdash;she wouldn't hear a word against him. I took what
  seemed to me to be the only chance. I went to him myself&mdash;I begged for
  mercy, I begged him to spare the child. I swore that if&mdash;anything
  happened to her, I would start a crusade against him, I would pledge my word
  that he should be cut by every decent man and woman on the stage! He listened
  to what I had to say and at first he only smiled. When I had finished, he
  made me an offer. He said that if I would sup with him alone at the Milan,
  and permit him to escort me home afterwards, he would spare the child. One
  further condition he made&mdash;that I was to tell no one why I did it. It
  was the man's brutal vanity! I made the promise, but I break it now. You have
  asked me and I have told you. I went through with the supper, although I
  hated it. I let him come in for a drink as though he had been a friend. Then
  he tried to make love to me. I took the opportunity of telling him exactly
  what I thought of him. Then I showed him the door, and left him.
  Afterwards&mdash;afterwards&mdash;Brian came in! They must have met upon the
  very threshold!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff took up his hat.</p>

  <p>"Thank you!" he said.</p>

  <p>"You see," she continued, drearily, "that it all has very little to do
  with the case. I meant to keep it to myself, because, of course, apart from
  anything else, apart from Brian's meeting him coming out of my rooms, it
  supplies an additional cause for anger on Brian's part."</p>

  <p>"I see," he answered. "I am much obliged to you, Miss Shaw. Believe me
  that you have my sincere sympathy!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff's farewell words were unheard. Letty had fallen forward in her
  chair, her head buried in her hands.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff went to Berkeley Square and found Lady Mary waiting for him.
  Sir William Trencham, the great solicitor, was with her. Lady Mary introduced
  the two men. All the time she was anxiously watching Ruff's face.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ruff has been to see Miss Shaw," she explained to Sir William. "Mr.
  Ruff, tell me quickly," she continued, with her hand upon his shoulder, "did
  she say anything? Did you find anything out?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No!" he said. "I found nothing out!"</p>

  <p>"You don't think, then," Lady Mary gasped, "that there is any
  chance&mdash;of getting her to confess&mdash;that she did it herself?"</p>

  <p>"Why should she have done it herself?" Peter Ruff asked. "She admits that
  the man tried to make love to her. She simply left him. She was in her own
  home, with her mother and servant within call. There was no struggle in the
  room&mdash;we know that. There was no necessity for any."</p>

  <p>"Have you made any other enquiries?" Lady Mary asked.</p>

  <p>"The few which I have made," Peter Ruff answered gravely, "point all in
  the same direction. I ascertained at the Milan that your brother called there
  late last night, and that he heard Miss Shaw had been supping alone with
  Austen Abbott. He followed them home. I have ascertained, too, that he had a
  key to Miss Shaw's flat. He apparently met Austen Abbott upon the
  threshold."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary covered her face with her hands. She seemed to read in Ruff's
  words the verdict of the two men&mdash;the verdict of common sense.
  Nevertheless, he made one more request before leaving.</p>

  <p>"I should like to see Captain Sotherst, if you can get me an order," he
  said to Sir William.</p>

  <p>"You can go with me to-morrow morning," the lawyer answered. "The
  proceedings this morning, of course, were simply formal. Until after the
  inquest it will be easy to arrange an interview."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary looked up quickly.</p>

  <p>"There is still something in your mind, then?" she asked. "You think that
  there is a bare chance?"</p>

  <p>"There is always the hundredth chance!" Peter Ruff replied.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff and Miss Brown supped at the Milan that night as they had
  arranged, but it was not a cheerful evening. Brian Sotherst had been very
  popular among Letty Shaw's little circle of friends, and the general feeling
  was one of horror and consternation at this thing which had befallen him.
  Austen Abbot, too, was known to all of them, and although a good many of the
  men&mdash;and even the women&mdash;were outspoken enough to declare at once
  that it served him right, nevertheless, the shock of death&mdash;death
  without a second's warning&mdash;had a paralysing effect even upon those who
  were his severest critics. Violet Brown spoke to a few of her
  friends&mdash;introduced Peter Ruff here and there&mdash;but nothing was said
  which could throw in any way even the glimmerings of a new light upon the
  tragedy. It all seemed too hopelessly and fatally obvious.</p>

  <p>About twenty minutes before closing time, the habitues of the place were
  provided with something in the nature of a sensation. A little party entered
  who seemed altogether free from the general air of gloom. Foremost among them
  was a very young and exceedingly pretty girl, with light golden hair waved in
  front of her forehead, deep blue eyes, and the slight, airy figure of a
  child. She was accompanied by another young woman, whose appearance was a
  little too obvious to be prepossessing, and three or four young
  men&mdash;dark, clean-shaven, dressed with the irritating exactness of their
  class&mdash;young stockbrokers or boys about town. Miss Brown's eyes grew
  very wide open.</p>

  <p>"What a little beast!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Who?" Peter Ruff asked.</p>

  <p>"That pretty girl there," she answered&mdash;"Fluffy Dean her name is. She
  is Letty Shaw's protege, and she wouldn't have dreamed of allowing her to
  come out with a crowd like that. Tonight, of all nights," she continued,
  indignantly, "when Letty is away!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff was interested.</p>

  <p>"So that is Miss Fluffy Dean," he remarked, looking at her curiously. "She
  seems a little excited."</p>

  <p>"She's a horrid little wretch!" Miss Brown declared. "I hope that some one
  will tell Letty, and that she will drop her now. A girl who would do such a
  thing as that when Letty is in such trouble isn't worth taking care of! Just
  listen to them all!"</p>

  <p>They were certainly becoming a little boisterous. A magnum of champagne
  was being opened. Fluffy Dean's cheeks were already flushed, and her eyes
  glittering. Every one at the table was talking a great deal and drinking
  toasts.</p>

  <p>"This is the end of Fluffy Dean," Violet Brown said, severely. "I hate to
  be uncharitable, but it serves her right."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff paid his bill.</p>

  <p>"Let us go," he said.</p>

  <p>In the taxicab, on their way back to Miss Brown's rooms, Ruff was
  unusually silent, but just before he said good night to her&mdash;on the
  pavement, in fact, outside her front door&mdash;he asked a question.</p>

  <p>"Violet," he said, "would you like to play detective for an hour or
  two?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him in some surprise.</p>

  <p>"You know I always like to help in anything that's going," she said.</p>

  <p>"Letty Shaw was an Australian, wasn't she?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"She was born there, and lived there till she was nearly eighteen&mdash;is
  that true?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>"Quite true," Miss Brown answered.</p>

  <p>"You know the offices of the P.&amp; O. line of steamers in Pall Mall?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Get a sailing list to Australia&mdash;there should be a boat going
  Thursday. Present yourself as a prospective passenger. See how many young
  women alone there are going out, and ask their names. Incidentally put in a
  little spare time watching the office."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with parted lips and wide-open eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do you think&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>He shook her hand warmly and stepped back into the taxicab.</p>

  <p>"Good night!" he said. "No questions, please. I sha'n't expect you at the
  office at the usual time to-morrow, at any rate. Telephone or run around if
  you've anything to tell me."</p>

  <p>The taxicab disappeared round the corner of the street. Miss Brown was
  standing still upon the pavement with the latchkey in her hand.</p>

  <h4>* * * * *</h4>

  <p>It was afternoon before the inquest on the body of Austen Abbott, and
  there was gathered together in Letty Shaw's parlor a curiously assorted
  little group of people. There was Miss Shaw herself&mdash;or rather what
  seemed to be the ghost of herself&mdash;and her mother; Lady Mary and Sir
  William Trencham; Peter Ruff and Violet Brown&mdash;and Mr. John Dory. The
  eyes of all of them were fixed upon Peter Ruff, who was the latest arrival.
  He stood in the middle of the room, calmly taking off his gloves, and
  glancing complacently down at his well-creased trousers.</p>

  <p>"Lady Mary," he said, "and Miss Shaw, I know that you are both anxious for
  me to explain why I ask you to meet me here this afternoon, and why I also
  requested my friend Mr. Dory from Scotland Yard, who has charge of the case
  against Captain Sotherst, to be present. I will tell you."</p>

  <p>Mr. Dory nodded, a little impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Unless you have something very definite to say," he remarked, "I think it
  would be as well to postpone any general discussion of this matter until
  after the inquest. I must warn you that so far as I, personally, am
  concerned, I must absolutely decline to allude to the subject at all. It
  would be most unprofessional."</p>

  <p>"I have something definite to say," Peter Ruff declared, mildly.</p>

  <p>Lady Mary's eyes flashed with hope&mdash;Letty Shaw leaned forward in her
  chair with white, drawn face.</p>

  <p>"Let it be understood," Peter Ruff said, with a slight note of gravity
  creeping into his tone, "that I am here solely as the agent of Lady Mary
  Sotherst. I am paid and employed by her. My sole object is on her behalf,
  therefore, to discover proof of the innocence of Captain Sotherst. I take it,
  however," he added, turning towards the drooping figure in the easy-chair,
  "that Miss Shaw is as anxious to have the truth known."</p>

  <p>"Of course! Of course!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"In France," Peter Ruff continued, "there is a somewhat curious custom,
  which, despite a certain theatricality, yet has its points. The scene of a
  crime is visited, and its events, so far as may be, reconstructed. Let us
  suppose for a moment that we are now engaged upon something of the sort."</p>

  <p>Letty Shaw shrank back in her chair. Her thin white fingers were gripping
  its sides. Her eyes seemed to look upon terrible things.</p>

  <p>"It is too&mdash;awful!" she faltered.</p>

  <p>"Madam," Peter Ruff said, firmly, "we seek the truth. Be so good as to
  humour me in this. Dory, will you go to the front door, stand upon the
  mat&mdash;so? You are Captain Sotherst&mdash;you have just entered. I am
  Austen Abbott. You, Miss Shaw, have just ordered me from the room. You see, I
  move toward the door. I open it&mdash;so. Miss Shaw," he added, turning
  swiftly towards her, "once more will you assure me that every one who was in
  the flat that night, with the exception of your domestic servant, is present
  now?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Good! Then who," he asked, suddenly pointing to a door on the
  left&mdash;"who is in that room?"</p>

  <p>They had all crowded after him to the threshold&mdash;thronging around him
  as he stood face to face with John Dory. His finger never wavered&mdash;it
  was pointing steadily towards that closed door a few feet to the left.
  Suddenly Letty Shaw rushed past them with a loud shriek.</p>

  <p>"You shall not go in!" she cried. "What business is it of his?"</p>

  <p>She stood with her back to the door, her arms outstretched like a cross.
  Her cheeks were livid. Her eyes seemed starting from her head.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff and John Dory laid their hands upon the girl's wrists. She
  clung to her place frantically. She was dragged from it, screaming. Peter
  Ruff, as was his right, entered first. Almost immediately he turned round,
  and his face was very grave.</p>

  <p>"Something has happened in here, I am afraid," he said. "Please come in
  quietly."</p>

  <p>On the bed lay Fluffy Dean, fully dressed&mdash;motionless. One hand hung
  down toward the floor&mdash;from the lifeless fingers a little phial had
  slipped. The room was full of trunks addressed to&mdash;</p>

  <p class="sign">MISS SMITH,<br>
  Passenger to Melborne.<br>
  S.S. Caroline.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff moved over toward the bed and took up a piece of paper, upon
  which were scribbled a few lines in pencil.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "that I must read these aloud. You all have a right to
  hear them."</p>

  <p>No one spoke. He continued:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Forgive me, Letty, but I cannot go to Australia. They
  would only bring me back. When I remember that awful moment, my brain
  burns&mdash;I feel that I am going mad! Some day I should do
  this&mdash;better now. Give my love to the girls.&mdash; FLUFFY.</p>

  <p>They sent for a doctor, and John Dory rang up Scotland Yard. Letty Shaw
  had fainted, and had been carried to her room. While they waited about in
  strange, half-benumbed excitement, Peter Ruff once more spoke to them.</p>

  <p>"The reconstruction is easy enough now," he remarked. "The partition
  between this sitting room and that little bedroom is only an artificial
  one&mdash;something almost as flimsy as a screen. You see," he continued,
  tapping with his knuckles, "you can almost put your hand through it. If you
  look a little lower down, you will see where an opening has been made. Fluffy
  Dean was being taken care of by Miss Shaw&mdash;staying with her here, even.
  Miss Dean hears her lover's voice in this room&mdash;hears him pleading with
  Miss Shaw on he night of the murder. She has been sent home early from the
  theatre, and it is just possible that she saw or had been told that Austen
  Abbott had fetched Miss Shaw after the performance and had taken her to
  supper. She was mad with anger and jealousy. The revolver was there upon the
  table, with a silver box of cartridges. She possessed herself of it and
  waited in her room. What she heard proved, at least, her lover's infidelity.
  She stood there at her door, waiting. When Austen Abbott comes out, she
  shoots, throws the revolver at him, closes her door, and goes off into a
  faint. Perhaps she hears footsteps&mdash;a key in the door. At any rate,
  Captain Sotherst arrives a few minutes later. He finds, half in the hall,
  half on the threshold of the sitting room, Austen Abbott dead, and Miss
  Shaw's revolver by the side of him. If he had been a wise young man, he would
  have aroused the household. Why he did not do so, we can perhaps guess. He
  put two and two together a little too quickly. It is certain that he believed
  that the dead man had been shot by his fiancee. His first thought was to get
  rid of the revolver. At any rate, he walked down to the street with it in his
  hand, and was promptly arrested by the policeman who had heard the shot.
  Naturally he refused to plead, because he believed that Miss Shaw had killed
  the man, probably in self-defence. She, at first, believed her lover guilty,
  and when afterwards Fluffy Dean confessed, she, with feminine lack of common
  sense, was trying to get the girl out of the country before telling the
  truth. A visit of hers to the office of the steamship company gave me the
  clue I required."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary grasped both his hands.</p>

  <p>"And Scotland Yard," she exclaimed, with a withering glance at Dory, "have
  done their best to hang my brother!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Dear Lady Mary," he said, "remember that it is the business of Scotland
  Yard to find a man guilty. It is mine, when I am employed for that purpose,
  to find him innocent. You must not be too hard upon my friend Mr. Dory. He
  and I seem to come up against each other a little too often, as it is."</p>

  <p>"A little too often!" John Dory repeated, softly. "But one cannot tell.
  Don't believe, Lady Mary," he added, "that we ever want to kill an innocent
  man."</p>

  <p>"It is your profession, though," she answered, "to find
  criminals&mdash;and his," she added, touching Peter Ruff on the shoulder, "to
  look for the truth."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff bowed low&mdash;the compliment pleased him.</p>

  <h2>V. DELILAH FROM STREATHAM<br>
  <small>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Jan
  1910</small></h2>

  <p class="first">It was a favourite theory with Peter Ruff that the morning
  papers received very insufficient consideration from the majority of the
  British public. A glance at the headlines and a few of the spiciest
  paragraphs, a vague look at the leading article, and the sheets were thrown
  away to make room for more interesting literature. It was not so with Peter
  Ruff. Novels he very seldom read&mdash;he did not, in fact, appreciate the
  necessity for their existence. The whole epitome of modern life was, he
  argued, to be found among the columns of the daily press. The police news,
  perhaps, was his favourite study, but he did not neglect the advertisements.
  It followed, therefore, as a matter of course, that the appeal of "M" in the
  personal column of the Daily Mail was read by him on the morning of its
  appearance&mdash;read not once only nor twice&mdash;it was a paragraph which
  had its own peculiar interest for him.</p>

  <p>Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald, if still in England, is requested to communicate
  with "M," at Vagali's Library, Cook's Alley, Ledham Street, Soho.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff laid the paper down upon his desk and looked steadily at a box
  of India-rubber bands. Almost his fingers, as he parted with the newspaper,
  had seemed to be shaking. His eyes were certainly set in an unusually
  retrospective stare. Who was this who sought to probe his past, to renew an
  acquaintance with a dead personality? "M" could be but one person! What did
  she want of him? Was it possible that, after all, a little flame of sentiment
  had been kept alight in her bosom, too&mdash;that in the quiet moments her
  thoughts had turned towards him as his had so often done to her? Then a
  sudden idea&mdash;an ugly thought&mdash;drove the tenderness from his face.
  She was no longer Maud Barnes&mdash;she was Mrs. John Dory, and John Dory was
  his enemy! Could there be treachery lurking beneath those simple lines?
  Things had not gone well with John Dory lately. Somehow or other, his cases
  seemed to have crumpled into dust. He was no longer held in the same esteem
  at headquarters. Yet could even John Dory stoop to such means as these?</p>

  <p>He turned in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Miss Brown," he said, "please take your pencil."</p>

  <p>"I am quite ready, sir," she answered.</p>

  <p>He marked the advertisement with a ring and passed it to her.</p>

  <p>"Reply to that as follows," he said:</p>

  <p class="quote">"DEAR SIR:&mdash; I notice in the <i>Daily Mail</i> of this
  morning that you are enquiring through the 'personal' column for the
  whereabouts of Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald. That gentleman has been a client of
  mine, and I have been in occasional communication with him. If you will
  inform me of the nature of your business, I may, perhaps, be able to put you
  in touch with Mr. Fitzgerald. You will understand, however, that, under the
  circumstances, I shall require proofs of your good faith. Truly yours, PETER
  RUFF."</p>

  <p>Miss Brown glanced through the advertisement and closed her notebook with
  a little snap.</p>

  <p>"Did you say&mdash;'Dear Sir'?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly!" Peter Ruff answered.</p>

  <p>"And you really mean," she continued, with obvious disapproval, "that I am
  to send this?"</p>

  <p>"I do not usually waste my time," Peter Ruff reminded her, mildly, "by
  giving you down communications destined for the waste-paper basket."</p>

  <p>She turned unwillingly to her machine.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Fitzgerald is very much better where he is," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"That depends," he answered.</p>

  <p>She adjusted a sheet of paper into her typewriter.</p>

  <p>"Who do you suppose 'M' is?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"With your assistance," Peter Ruff remarked, a little
  sarcastically&mdash;"with your very kind assistance&mdash;I propose to find
  out!"</p>

  <p>Miss Brown sniffed, and banged at the keys of her typewriter.</p>

  <p>"That coal-dealer's girl from Streatham!" she murmured to herself....</p>

  <p>A few politely worded letters were exchanged. "M" declined to reveal her
  identity, but made an appointment to visit Mr. Ruff at his office. The
  morning she was expected, he wore an entirely new suit of clothes and was
  palpably nervous. Miss Brown, who had arrived a little late, sat with her
  back turned upon him, and ignored even his usual morning greeting. The
  atmosphere of the office was decidedly chilly! Fortunately, the expected
  visitor arrived early.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff rose to receive his former sweetheart with an agitation
  perforce concealed, yet to him poignant indeed. For it was indeed Maud who
  entered the room and came towards him with carefully studied embarrassment
  and half doubtfully extended hand. He did not see the cheap millinery, the
  slightly more developed figure, the passing of that insipid prettiness which
  had once charmed him into the bloom of an over-early maturity. His eyes were
  blinded with that sort of masculine chivalry&mdash;the heritage only of fools
  and very clever men&mdash;which takes no note of such things. It was Miss
  Brown who, from her place in a corner of the room, ran over the cheap
  attractions of this unwelcome visitor with an expression of scornful
  wonder&mdash;who understood the tinsel of her jewellery, the cheap shoddiness
  of her ready-made gown; who appreciated, with merciless judgment, her mincing
  speech, her cheap, flirtatious method.</p>

  <p>Maud, with a diffidence not altogether assumed, had accepted the chair
  which Peter Ruff had placed for her, and sat fidgeting, for a moment, with
  the imitation gold purse which she was carrying.</p>

  <p>"I am sure, Mr. Ruff," she said, looking demurely into her lap, "I ought
  not to have come here. I feel terribly guilty. It's such an uncomfortable
  sort of position, too, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry that you find it so," Peter Ruff said. "If there is anything I
  can do&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are very kind," she murmured, half raising her eyes to his and
  dropping them again, "but, you see, we are perfect strangers to one another.
  You don't know me at all, do you? And I have only heard of you through the
  newspapers. You might think all sorts of things about my coming here to make
  enquiries about a gentleman."</p>

  <p>"I can assure you," Peter Ruff said, sincerely, "that you need have no
  fears&mdash;no fears at all. Just speak to me quite frankly. Mr. Fitzgerald
  was a friend of yours, was he not?"</p>

  <p>Maud simpered.</p>

  <p>"He was more than that," she answered, looking down. "We were engaged to
  be married."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff sighed.</p>

  <p>"I knew all about it," he declared. "Fitzgerald used to tell me
  everything."</p>

  <p>"You were his friend?" she asked, looking him in the face.</p>

  <p>"I was," Peter Ruff answered fervently, "his best friend! No one was more
  grieved than I about that&mdash;little mistake."</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"In some ways," she remarked softly, "you remind me of him."</p>

  <p>"You could scarcely say anything," Peter Ruff murmured "which would give
  me more pleasure. I am flattered."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It isn't flattery," she said, "it's the truth. You may be a few years
  older, and Spencer had a very nice moustache, which you haven't, but you are
  really not unlike. Mr. Ruff, do tell me where he is!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff coughed.</p>

  <p>"You must remember," he said, "that Mr. Fitzgerald's absence was caused by
  events of a somewhat unfortunate character."</p>

  <p>"I know all about it," she answered, with a little sigh.</p>

  <p>"You can appreciate the fact, therefore," Peter Ruff continued, "that as
  his friend and well-wisher I can scarcely disclose his whereabouts without
  his permission. Will you tell me exactly why you want to meet him again?"</p>

  <p>She blushed&mdash;looked down and up again&mdash;betrayed, in fact, all
  the signs of confusion which might have been expected from her.</p>

  <p>"Must I tell you that?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You are married, are you not?" Peter Ruff asked, looking down at her
  wedding ring.</p>

  <p>She bit her lip with vexation. What a fool she had been not to take it
  off!</p>

  <p>"Yes! Well, no&mdash;that is to say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind," Peter Ruff interrupted. "Please don't think that I want to
  cross-examine you. I only asked these questions because I have a sincere
  regard for Fitzgerald. I know how fond he was of you, and I cannot see what
  there is to be gained, from his point of view, by reopening old wounds."</p>

  <p>"I suppose, then," she remarked, looking at him in such a manner that Miss
  Brown had to cover her mouth with her hands to prevent her screaming
  out&mdash;"I suppose you are one of those who think it a crime for a woman
  who is married even to want to see, for a few moments, an old
  sweetheart?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," Peter Ruff answered, "as a bachelor, I have no
  convictions of any sort upon the subject."</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"I am glad of that," she said.</p>

  <p>"I am to understand, then," Peter Ruff remarked, "that your reason for
  wishing to meet Mr. Fitzgerald again is purely a sentimental one?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid it is," she murmured; "I have thought of him so often lately.
  He was such a dear!" she declared, with enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"I have never been sufficiently thankful," she continued, "that he got
  away that night. At the time, I was very angry, but often since then I have
  wished that I could have passed out with him into the fog and been
  lost&mdash;but I mustn't talk like this! Please don't misunderstand me, Mr.
  Ruff. I am happily married&mdash;quite happily married!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff sighed.</p>

  <p>"My friend Fitzgerald," he remarked, "will be glad to hear that."</p>

  <p>Maud fidgeted. It was not quite the effect she had intended to
  produce!</p>

  <p>"Of course," she remarked, looking away with a pensive air, "one has
  regrets."</p>

  <p>"Regrets!" Peter Ruff murmured.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Dory is not well off," she continued, "and I am afraid that I am very
  fond of life and going about, and everything is so expensive nowadays. Then I
  don't like his profession. I think it is hateful to be always trying to catch
  people and put them in prison&mdash;don't you, Mr. Ruff?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff smiled.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," he answered. "Your husband and I work from the opposite poles
  of life. He is always seeking to make criminals of the people whom I am
  always trying to prove worthy members of society."</p>

  <p>"How noble!" Maud exclaimed, clasping her hands and looking up at him. "So
  much more remunerative, too, I should think," she added, after a moment's
  pause.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," Peter Ruff admitted. "A private individual will pay more to
  escape from the clutches of the law than the law will to secure its victims.
  Scotland Yard expects them to come into its arms automatically&mdash;regards
  them as a perquisite of its existence."</p>

  <p>"I wish my husband were in your profession, Mr. Ruff," Maud said, with a
  sidelong glance of her blue eyes which she had always found so effective upon
  her various admirers. "I am sure that I should be a great deal fonder of
  him."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff leaned forward in his chair. He, too, had expressive eyes at
  times.</p>

  <p>"Madam," he said&mdash;and stopped. But Maud blushed, all the same.</p>

  <p>She looked down into her lap.</p>

  <p>"We are forgetting Mr. Fitzgerald," she murmured.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff glanced up at the clock.</p>

  <p>"It is a long story," he said. "Are you in a hurry, Mrs. Dory?</p>

  <p>"Not at all," she assured him, "unless you want to close you office, or
  anything. It must be nearly one o'clock."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he asked, "if you would do me the honour of lunching with me?
  We might go to the Prince's or the Carlton&mdash;whichever you prefer. I will
  promise to talk about Mr. Fitzgerald all the time."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I couldn't!" Maud declared, with a little gasp. "At least&mdash;well,
  I'm sure I don't know!"</p>

  <p>"You have no engagement for luncheon?" Peter Ruff asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no!" she answered; "but, you see, we live so quietly. I have never
  been to one of those places. I'd love to go&mdash;but if we were seen!
  Wouldn't people talk?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff smiled. Just the same dear, modest little thing!</p>

  <p>"I can assure you," he said, "that nothing whatever could be said against
  our lunching together. People are not so strict nowadays, you know, and a
  married lady has always a great deal of latitude."</p>

  <p>She looked up at him with a dazzling smile.</p>

  <p>"I'd simply love to go to Prince's!" she declared.</p>

  <p>"Cat!" Miss Brown murmured, as Peter Ruff and his client left the room
  together.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff returned from his luncheon in no very jubilant state of mind.
  For some time he sat in his easy-chair, with his legs crossed and his finger
  tips pressed close together, looking steadily into space. Contrary to his
  usual custom, he did not smoke. Miss Brown watched him from behind her
  machine.</p>

  <p>"Disenchanted?" she asked calmly.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff did not reply for several moments.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he admitted, hesitatingly, "that marriage with John Dory
  has&mdash;well, not had a beneficial effect. She allowed me, for instance, to
  hold her hand in the cab! Maud would never have permitted a stranger to take
  such a liberty in the old days."</p>

  <p>Miss Brown smiled curiously.</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff felt that he was in the confessional.</p>

  <p>"She certainly did seem," he admitted, "to enjoy her champagne a great
  deal, and she talked about her dull life at home a little more, perhaps, than
  was discreet to one who was presumably a stranger. She was curious, too,
  about dining out. Poor little girl, though. Just fancy, John Dory has never
  taken her anywhere but to Lyons' or an A B C, and the pit of a theatre!"</p>

  <p>"Which evening is it to be?" Miss Brown asked.</p>

  <p>"Something was said about Thursday," Peter Ruff admitted.</p>

  <p>"And her husband?" Miss Brown enquired.</p>

  <p>"He happens to be in Glasgow for a few days," Peter Ruff answered.</p>

  <p>Miss Brown looked at her employer steadily. She addressed him by his
  Christian name, which was a thing she very seldom did in office hours.</p>

  <p>"Peter," she said, "are you going to let that woman make a fool of
  you?"</p>

  <p>He raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he said; "say anything you want to&mdash;only, if you please,
  don't speak disrespectfully of Maud."</p>

  <p>"Hasn't it ever occurred to you at all," Miss Brown continued, rising to
  her feet, "that this Maud, or whatever you want to call her, may be playing a
  low-down game of her husband's? He hates you, and he has vague suspicions.
  Can't you see that he is probably making use of your infatuation for his
  common, middle-class little wife, to try and get you to give yourself away?
  Can't you see it, Peter? You are not going to tell me that you are so blind
  as all that!"</p>

  <p>"I must admit," he answered with a sigh, "that, although I think you go
  altogether too far, some suspicion of the sort has interfered with my perfect
  enjoyment of the morning."</p>

  <p>Miss Brown drew a little breath of relief. After all, then, his folly was
  not so consummate as it had seemed!</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do about it, then?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff coughed&mdash;he seemed in an unusually amenable frame of mind,
  and submitted to cross-examination without murmur.</p>

  <p>"The subject of Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald," he remarked, "seemed, somehow or
  other, to drop into the background during our luncheon. I propose, therefore,
  to continue to offer to Mrs. John Dory my most respectful admiration. If she
  accepts my friendship, and is satisfied with it, so much the better. I must
  admit that it would give me a great deal of pleasure to be her occasional
  companion&mdash;at such times when her husband happens to be in Glasgow!"</p>

  <p>"And supposing," Miss Brown asked, "that this is not all she
  wants&mdash;supposing, for instance, that she persists in her desire for
  information concerning Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald?"</p>

  <p>"Then," Peter Ruff admitted, "I'm afraid that I must conclude that her
  unchivalrous clod of a husband has indeed stooped to make a fool of her."</p>

  <p>"And in that case," Miss Brown demanded, "what shall you do?"</p>

  <p>"I was just thinking that out," Peter Ruff said mildly, "when you
  spoke...."</p>

  <p>The friendship of Peter Ruff with the wife of his enemy certainly appeared
  to progress in most satisfactory fashion. The dinner and visit to the theatre
  duly took place. Mr. Ruff was afterwards permitted to offer a slight supper
  and to accompany his fair companion a portion of the way home in a taxicab.
  She made several half-hearted attempts to return to the subject of Spencer
  Fitzgerald, but her companion had been able on each occasion to avoid the
  subject. Whether or not she was the victim of her husband's guile, there was
  no question about the reality of her enjoyment during the evening. Ruff, when
  he remembered the flash of her eyes across the table, the touch of her
  fingers in the taxi, was almost content to believe her false to her truant
  lover. If only she had not been married to John Dory, he realised, with a
  little sigh, that he might have taught her to forget that such a person
  existed as Spencer Fitzgerald, might have induced her to become Mrs. Peter
  Ruff!</p>

  <p>On their next meeting, however, Peter Ruff was forced to realise that his
  secretary's instinct had not misled her. It was, alas, no personal and
  sentimental regrets for her former lover which had brought the fair Maud to
  his office. The pleasures of her evening&mdash;they dined at Romano's and had
  a box at the Empire&mdash;were insufficient this time to keep her from
  recurring continually to the subject of her vanished lover. He tried
  strategy&mdash;jealousy amongst other things.</p>

  <p>"Supposing," he said, as they sat quite close to one another in the box
  during the interval, "supposing I were to induce our friend to come to
  London&mdash;I imagine he would be fairly safe now if he kept out of your
  husband's way&mdash;what would happen to me?"</p>

  <p>"You!" she murmured, glancing at him from behind her fan and then dropping
  her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Certainly&mdash;me!" he continued. "Don't you think that I should be
  doing myself a very ill turn if I brought you two together? I have very few
  friends, and I cannot afford to lose one. I am quite sure that you still care
  for him."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Not a scrap!" she declared.</p>

  <p>"Then why did you put that advertisement in the paper?" Ruff asked, with
  smooth but swift directness.</p>

  <p>She was not quick enough to parry his question. He read the truth in her
  disconcerted face. Knowing it now for a certainty, he hastened to her
  aid.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me," he said, looking away. "I should not have asked that
  question&mdash;it is not my business. I will write to Fitzgerald. I will tell
  him that you want to see him, and that I think it would be safe for him to
  come to London."</p>

  <p>Maud recovered herself quickly. She thanked him with her eyes as well as
  her words.</p>

  <p>"And you needn't be jealous, really," she whispered behind her fan. "I
  only want to see him once for a few minutes&mdash;to ask a question. After
  that, I don't care what becomes of him."</p>

  <p>A poor sort of Delilah, really, with her flushed face, her too elaborately
  coiffured hair with its ugly ornament, her ready-made evening dress with its
  cheap attempts at smartness, her cleaned gloves, indifferent shoes. But Peter
  Ruff thought otherwise.</p>

  <p>"You mean that, after I have found him for you, you will still come out
  with me again sometimes?" he asked wistfully.</p>

  <p>"Of course!" she answered. "Whenever I can without John knowing," she
  added, with an unpleasant little laugh. "If you only knew how I loved the
  music and the theatres, and this sort of life! What a good time your wife
  would have, Mr. Ruff!" she added archly.</p>

  <p>It was no joking matter with him. He had to remember that he was, in
  effect, her tool, that she was making use of him, willing to betray her
  former lover at her husband's bidding. It was enough to make him, on his
  side, burn for revenge! Yet he put the thought away from him with a shiver.
  She was still the woman he had loved&mdash;she was still sacred to him! That
  night he pleaded an engagement, and sent her home in a taxicab alone.</p>

  <p>John Dory, waiting patiently at home for his wife's return, felt a certain
  uneasiness when she swept into their little sitting room in all her cheap
  splendour, with flushed cheeks&mdash;an obvious air of satisfaction with
  herself and disdain for her immediate surroundings. John Dory was a
  commonplace looking man&mdash;the absence of his collar, and his somewhat
  shabby carpet slippers, did not improve his appearance. He had neglected to
  shave, and he was drinking beer. At headquarters he was not considered quite
  the smart young officer which he had once shown signs of becoming. He looked
  at his wife with darkening face, and his wife, on her part, thought of Peter
  Ruff in his immaculate evening clothes.</p>

  <p>"Well," he remarked, grumblingly, "you seem to find a good deal of
  pleasure in this gadding about!"</p>

  <p>She threw her soiled fan on the table.</p>

  <p>"If I do," she answered, "you are not the one to sit there and reproach me
  with it, are you?"</p>

  <p>"It's gone far enough, anyway," John Dory said. "It's gone further than I
  meant it to go. Understand me, Maud&mdash;it's finished! I'll find your old
  sweetheart for myself."</p>

  <p>She laughed heartily.</p>

  <p>"You needn't trouble," she answered, with a little toss of the head. "I am
  not such a fool as you seem to think me. Mr. Ruff has made an appointment
  with him."</p>

  <p>There was a change in John Dory's face. The man's eyes were
  bright&mdash;they almost glittered.</p>

  <p>"You mean that your friend Mr. Ruff is going to produce Spencer
  Fitzgerald?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"He has promised to," she answered. "John," she declared, throwing herself
  into an easy-chair, "I feel horrid about it. I wonder what Mr. Ruff will
  think when he knows!"</p>

  <p>"You can feel how you like," John Dory answered bluntly, "so long as I get
  the handcuffs on Spencer Fitzgerald's wrists!"</p>

  <p>She shuddered. She looked at her husband with distaste.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk about it!" she begged sharply. "It makes me feel the meanest
  creature that ever crawled. I can't help feeling, too, that Mr. Ruff will
  think me a wretch&mdash;quite the gentleman he's been all the time! I never
  knew any one half so nice!"</p>

  <p>John Dory set down his empty glass.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he said, looking at her thoughtfully, "what made him take such
  a fancy to you! Rather sudden, wasn't it, eh?"</p>

  <p>Maud tossed her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't see anything so wonderful about that," she declared.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, Maud," her husband said, rising to his feet. "You aren't a
  fool&mdash;not quite. You've spent some time with Peter Ruff. How
  much&mdash;think carefully&mdash;how much does he remind you of Spencer
  Fitzgerald?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," she answered promptly. "Why, he is years older, and though
  Spencer was quite the gentleman, there's something about Mr. Ruff, and the
  way he dresses and knows his way about&mdash;well, you can tell he's been a
  gentleman all his life."</p>

  <p>John Dory's face fell.</p>

  <p>"Think again," he said.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Can't see any likeness," she declared. "He did remind me a little of him
  just at first, though," she added, reflectively&mdash;"little things he said,
  and sort of mannerisms. I've sort of lost sight of them the last few times,
  though."</p>

  <p>"When is this meeting with Fitzgerald to come off?" John Dory asked
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>She did not answer him at once. A low, triumphant smile had parted her
  lips.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow night," she said; "he is to meet me in Mr. Ruff's office."</p>

  <p>"At what time?" John Dory asked.</p>

  <p>"At eight o'clock," she answered. "Mr. Ruff is keeping his office open
  late on purpose. Spencer thinks that afterwards he is going to take me out to
  dinner."</p>

  <p>"You are sure of this?" John Dory asked eagerly. "You are sure that the
  man Ruff does not suspect you? You believe he means that you shall meet
  Fitzgerald?"</p>

  <p>"I am sure of it," she answered. "He is even a little jealous," she
  continued, with an affected laugh. "He told me&mdash;well, never mind!"</p>

  <p>"He told you what?" John Dory asked.</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"Never you mind," she said. "I have done what you asked me anyway. If Mr.
  Ruff had not found me an agreeable companion he would not have bothered about
  getting Spencer to meet me. And now he's done it," she added, "I do believe
  he's a little jealous."</p>

  <p>John Dory glared, but he said nothing. It seemed to him that his hour of
  revenge was close at hand!</p>

  <p>It was the first occasion upon which words of this sort had passed between
  Peter Ruff and his secretary. There was no denying the fact that Miss Violet
  Brown was in a passion. It was an hour past the time at which she usually
  left the office. For an hour she had pleaded, and Peter Ruff remained
  unmoved.</p>

  <p>"You are a fool!" she cried to him at last. "I am a fool, too, that I have
  ever wasted my thoughts and time upon you. Why can't I make you see? In every
  other way, heaven knows, you are clever enough! And yet there comes this
  vulgar, commonplace, tawdry little woman from heaven knows where, and makes
  such a fool of you that you are willing to fling away your career&mdash;to
  hold your wrists out for John Dory's handcuffs!"</p>

  <p>"My dear Violet," Peter Ruff answered deprecatingly, "you really worry
  me&mdash;you do indeed!"</p>

  <p>"Not half so much as you worry me," she declared. "Look at the time. It's
  already past seven. At eight o'clock Mrs. Dory&mdash;your Maud&mdash;is
  coming in here hoping to find her old sweetheart."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he murmured.</p>

  <p>"Why not, indeed?" Miss Brown answered angrily. "Don't you
  know&mdash;can't you believe&mdash;that close on her heels will come her
  husband&mdash;that Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald, if ever he comes to life in this
  room, will leave it between two policemen?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff sighed.</p>

  <p>"What a pessimist you are, my dear Violet!" he said.</p>

  <p>She came up to him and laid her hands upon his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Peter," she said, "I will tell you something&mdash;I must! I am fond of
  you, Peter. I always have been. Don't make me miserable if there is no need
  for it. Tell me honestly&mdash;do you really believe in this woman?"</p>

  <p>He removed her hands gently, and raised them to his lips.</p>

  <p>"My dear girl," he said, "I believe in every one until I find them out. I
  look upon suspicion as a vice. But, at the same time," he added, "there are
  always certain precautions which one takes."</p>

  <p>"What precautions can you take?" she cried. "Can you sit there and make
  yourself invisible? John Dory is not a fool. The moment he is in this room
  with the door closed behind him, it is the end."</p>

  <p>"We must hope not," Peter Ruff said cheerfully. "There are other things
  which may happen, you know."</p>

  <p>She turned away from him a little drearily.</p>

  <p>"You do not mind if I stay?" she said. "I am not working to-night.
  Perhaps, later on, I may be of use!"</p>

  <p>"As you will," he answered. "You will excuse me for a little time, won't
  you? I have some preparations to make."</p>

  <p>She turned her head away from him. He left the room and ascended the
  stairs to his own apartments.</p>

  <p>Eight o'clock was striking from St. Martin's Church when the door of Peter
  Ruff's office was softly opened and closed again. A man in a slouch hat and
  overcoat entered, and after feeling along the wall for a moment, turned up
  the electric light. Violet Brown rose from her place with a little sob. She
  stretched out her hand to him.</p>

  <p>"Peter!" she cried. "Peter!"</p>

  <p>"My name," the newcomer said calmly, "is Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald."</p>

  <p>"Oh, listen to me!" she begged. "There is still time, if you hurry. Think
  how many clever men before you have been deceived by the woman in whom they
  trusted. Please, please go! Hurry upstairs and put those things away."</p>

  <p>"Madam," the newcomer said, "I am much obliged to you for your interest,
  but I think that you are making a mistake. I have come here to
  meet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped short. There was a soft knocking at the door. A stifled scream
  broke from Violet Brown's lips.</p>

  <p>"It is too late!" she cried. "Peter! Peter!"</p>

  <p>She sank into her chair and covered her face with her hands. The door was
  opened and Maud came in. When she saw who it was who sat in Peter Ruff's
  place, she gave a little cry. Perhaps after all, she had not believed that
  this thing would happen.</p>

  <p>"Spencer!" she cried, "Spencer! Have you really come back?"</p>

  <p>He held out his hands.</p>

  <p>"You are glad to see me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She came slowly forward. The man rose from his place and came towards her
  with outstretched hands. Then through the door came John Dory, and one caught
  a glimpse of others behind him.</p>

  <p>"If my wife is not glad to see you, Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald," he aid, in a
  tone from which he vainly tried to keep the note of triumph, "I can assure
  you that I am. You slipped away from me cleverly at Daisy Villa, but this
  time I think you will not find it so easy."</p>

  <p>Maud shrank back, and her husband took her place. But Mr. Spencer
  Fitzgerald looked upon them both as one who looks upon figures in a dream.
  Miss Brown rose hurriedly from her seat. She came over to him and thrust her
  arm through his.</p>

  <p>"Peter," she said, taking his hand in hers, "don't shoot. It isn't worth
  while. You should have listened to me."</p>

  <p>The little man in the gold-rimmed spectacles looked at her, looked at Mr.
  John Dory, looked at the woman who was shrinking back now against the
  wall.</p>

  <p>"Really," he said, "this is the most extraordinary situation in which I
  ever found myself!"</p>

  <p>"We will help you to realise it," John Dory cried, and the triumph in his
  tone had swelled into a deeper note. "I came here to arrest Mr. Fitzgerald,
  but I hear this young lady call you 'Peter.' Perhaps this may be the
  solution&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The little man struck the table with the flat of his hand.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "this is getting a bit too thick. First of
  all&mdash;you," he said, turning to Miss Brown&mdash;"my name is not Peter,
  and I have no idea of shooting anybody. As for that lady against the wall, I
  don't know her&mdash;never saw her before in my life. As for you," he added,
  turning to John Dory, "you talk about arresting me&mdash;what for?"</p>

  <p>Mr. John Dory smiled.</p>

  <p>"There is an old warrant," he said, "which I have in my pocket, but I
  fancy that there are a few little things since then which we may have to
  enquire into."</p>

  <p>"This beats me!" the little man declared. "Who do you think I am?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald, to start with," John Dory said. "It seems to me
  not impossible that we may find another pseudonym for you."</p>

  <p>"You can find as many as you like," the little man answered testily, "but
  my name is James Fitzgerald, and I am an actor employed at the Shaftesbury
  Theatre, as I can prove with the utmost ease. I never called myself Spencer;
  nor, to my knowledge, was I ever called by such a name. Nor, as I remarked
  before, have I ever seen any one of you three people before with the
  exception of Miss Brown here, whom I have seen on the stage."</p>

  <p>John Dory grunted.</p>

  <p>"It was Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald," he said, "a clerk in Howell &amp;
  Wilson's bookshop, who leapt out of the window of Daisy Villa two years ago.
  It may be Mr. James Fitzgerald now. Gentlemen of your profession have a knack
  of changing their names."</p>

  <p>"My profession's as good as yours, anyway!" the little man exclaimed. "We
  aren't all fools in it! My friend Mr. Peter Ruff said to me that there was a
  young lady whom I used to know who was anxious to meet me again, and would I
  step around here about eight o'clock. Here I am, and all I can say is, if
  that's the young lady, I never saw her before in my life."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's breathless silence. Then the door was softly opened.
  Violet Brown went staggering back like a woman who sees a ghost. She bit her
  lips till the blood came. It was Peter Ruff who stood looking in upon
  them&mdash;Peter Ruff, carefully dressed in evening clothes, his silk hat at
  exactly the correct angle, his coat and white kid gloves upon his arm.</p>

  <p>"Dear me," he said, "you don't seem to be getting on very well! Mr. Dory,"
  he added, with a note of surprise in his tone, "this is indeed an unexpected
  pleasure!"</p>

  <p>The man who stood by the desk turned to him. The others were stricken
  dumb.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "there's some mistake. You told me to come here at
  eight o'clock to meet a young lady whom I used to know. Well, I never saw her
  before in my life," he added, pointing to Maud. "There's a man there who
  wants to arrest me&mdash;Lord knows what for! And here's Miss Brown, whom I
  have seen at the theatre several times but who never condescended to speak to
  me before, telling me not to shoot! What's it all about, Ruff? Is it a
  practical joke?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff laid down his coat and hat, and sat upon the table with his
  hands in his pockets.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible," he said, "that I have made a mistake? Isn't your second
  name Spencer?"</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"My name is James Fitzgerald," he said. "I haven't missed a day at the
  Shaftesbury Theatre for three years, as you can find out by going round the
  corner. I never called myself Spencer, I was never clerk in a bookshop, and I
  never saw that lady before in my life."</p>

  <p>Maud came out from her place against the wall, and leaned eagerly forward.
  John Dory turned his head slowly towards his wife. A sickening fear had
  arisen in his heart&mdash;gripped him by the throat. Fooled once more, and by
  Peter Ruff!</p>

  <p>"It isn't Spencer!" Maud said huskily. "Mr. Ruff," she added, turning to
  him, "you know very well that this is not the Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald whom you
  promised to bring here to-night&mdash;Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald to whom I was
  once engaged."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff pointed to the figure of her husband.</p>

  <p>"Madam," he said, "my invitation did not include your husband."</p>

  <p>John Dory took a step forward, and laid his hands upon the shoulders of
  the man who called himself Mr. James Fitzgerald. He looked into his face long
  and carefully. Then he turned away, and, gripping his wife by the arm, he
  passed out of the room. The door slammed behind him. The sound of heavy
  footsteps was heard descending to the floor below.</p>

  <p>Violet Brown crossed the room to where Peter Ruff was still sitting with a
  queer look upon his face, and, gripping him by the shoulders, shook him.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" she exclaimed. "How dare you! Do you know that I have
  nearly cried my eyes out?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff came back from the world into which, for the moment, his
  thoughts had taken him.</p>

  <p>"Violet," he said, "you have known me for some years. You have been my
  secretary for some months. If you choose still to take me for a fool, I
  cannot help it."</p>

  <p>"But," she exclaimed, pointing to Mr. James Fitzgerald&mdash;</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"I have been practising on him for some time," he said, with an air of
  self-satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"A thin, mobile face, you see, and plenty of experience in the art of
  making up. It is astonishing what one can do if one tries."</p>

  <p>Mr. James Fitzgerald picked up his hat and coat.</p>

  <p>"It was worth more than five quid," he growled; "when I saw the handcuffs
  in that fellow's hand, I felt a cold shiver go down my spine."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff counted out two banknotes and passed them to his
  confederate.</p>

  <p>"You have earned the money," he said. "Go and spend it. Perhaps, Violet,"
  he added, turning towards her, "I have been a little inconsiderate. Come and
  have dinner with me, and forget it."</p>

  <p>She drew a little sigh.</p>

  <p>"You are sure," she murmured, "that you wouldn't rather take Maud?"</p>

  <h2>VI. THE LITTLE LADY FROM SERVIA<br>
  <small>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Feb
  1910</small></h2>

  <p class="first">Westward sped the little electric brougham, driven without
  regard to police regulations or any rule of the road: silent and swift,
  wholly regardless of other vehicles&mdash;as though, indeed, its occupants
  were assuming to themselves the rights of Royalty. Inside, Peter Ruff, a
  little breathless, was leaning forward, tying his white cravat with the aid
  of the little polished mirror set in the middle of the dark green cushions.
  At his right hand was Lady Mary, watching his proceedings with an air of
  agonised impatience.</p>

  <p>"Let me tell you&mdash;" she begged.</p>

  <p>"Kindly wait till I have tied this and put my studs in," Peter Ruff
  interrupted. "It is impossible for me to arrive at a ball in this condition,
  and I cannot give my whole attention to more than one thing at a time."</p>

  <p>"We shall be there in five minutes!" she exclaimed. "What is the good,
  unless you understand, of your coming at all?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff surveyed his tie critically. Fortunately, it pleased him. He
  began to press the studs into their places with firm fingers. Around them
  surged the traffic of Piccadilly; in front, the gleaming arc of lights around
  Hyde Park Corner. They had several narrow escapes. Once the brougham swayed
  dangerously as they cut in on the wrong side of an island lamp-post. A
  policeman shouted after them, another held up his hand&mdash;the driver of
  the brougham took no notice.</p>

  <p>"I am ready," Peter Ruff said, quietly.</p>

  <p>"My younger brother&mdash;Maurice," she began, breathlessly&mdash;"you've
  never met him, I know, but you've heard me speak of him. He is private
  secretary to Sir James Wentley&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Minister for Foreign Affairs?" Ruff asked, swiftly.</p>

  <p>"Yes! Maurice wants to go in for the Diplomatic Service. He is a dear, and
  so clever!"</p>

  <p>"Is it Maurice who is in trouble?" Peter Ruff asked. "Why didn't he come
  himself?"</p>

  <p>"I am trying to explain," Lady Mary protested. "This afternoon he had an
  important paper to turn into cipher and hand over to the Prime Minister at
  the Duchess of Montford's dance to-night. The Prime Minister will arrive in a
  motor car from the country at about two o'clock, and the first thing he will
  ask for will be that paper. It has been stolen!"</p>

  <p>"At what time did your brother finish copying it, and when did he discover
  its loss?" Ruff asked, with a slight air of weariness. These preliminary
  enquiries always bored him.</p>

  <p>"He finished it in his own rooms at half-past seven," Lady Mary answered.
  "He discovered its loss at eleven o'clock&mdash;directly he had arrived at
  the ball."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't he come to me himself?" Peter Ruff asked. "I like to have
  these particulars at first hand."</p>

  <p>"He is in attendance upon Sir James at the ball," Lady Mary answered.
  "There is trouble in the East, as you know, and Sir James is expecting
  dispatches to-night. Maurice is not allowed to leave."</p>

  <p>"Has he told Sir James yet?"</p>

  <p>"He had not when I left," Lady Mary answered. "If he is forced to do so,
  it will be ruin! Mr. Ruff, you must help us Maurice is such a dear, but a
  mistake like this, at the very beginning of his career, would be fatal. Here
  we are. That is my brother waiting just inside the hall."</p>

  <p>A young man came up to them in the vestibule. He was somewhat pale, but
  otherwise perfectly self-possessed. From the shine of his glossy black hair
  to the tips of his patent boots he was, in appearance, everything that a
  young Englishman of birth and athletic tastes could hope to be. Peter Ruff
  liked the look of him. He waited for no introduction, but laid his hand at
  once upon the young man's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Between seven-thirty and arriving here," he said, drawing him on one
  side&mdash;"quick! Tell me, whom did you see? What opportunities were there
  of stealing the paper, and by whom?"</p>

  <p>"I finished it at five and twenty past seven," the young man said, "sealed
  it in an official envelope, and stood it up on my desk by the side of my coat
  and hat and muffler, which my servant had laid there, ready for me to put on.
  My bedroom opens out from my sitting room. While I was dressing, two men
  called for me&mdash;Paul Jermyn and Count von Hern. They walked through to my
  bedroom first, and then sat together in the sitting room until I came out.
  The door was wide open, and we talked all the time."</p>

  <p>"They called accidentally?" Peter Ruff asked.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;by appointment," the young man replied. "We were all coming on
  here to the dance, and we had agreed to dine together first at the
  Savoy."</p>

  <p>"You say that you left the paper on your desk with your coat and hat?"
  Peter Ruff asked. "Was it there when you came out?"</p>

  <p>"Apparently so," the young man answered. "It seemed to be standing in
  exactly the same place as where I had left it. I put it into my breast
  pocket, and it was only when I arrived here that I fancied the envelope
  seemed lighter. I went off by myself and tore it open. There was nothing
  inside but half a newspaper!"</p>

  <p>"What about the envelope?" Peter Ruff asked. "That must have been the same
  sort of one as you had used or you would have noticed it?"</p>

  <p>"It was," the Honorable Maurice answered.</p>

  <p>"It was a sort which you kept in your room?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" the young man admitted.</p>

  <p>"The packet was changed, then, by some one in your room, or some one who
  had access to it," Peter Ruff said. "How about your servant?"</p>

  <p>"It was his evening off. I let him put out my things and go at seven
  o'clock."</p>

  <p>"You must tell me the nature of the contents of the packet," Peter Ruff
  declared. "Don't hesitate. You must do it. Remember the alternative."</p>

  <p>The young man did hesitate for several moments, but a glance into his
  sister's appealing face decided him.</p>

  <p>"It was our official reply to a secret communication from Russia
  respecting&mdash;a certain matter in the Balkans."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"Where is Count von Hern?" he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Inside, dancing."</p>

  <p>"I must use a telephone at once," Peter Ruff said. "Ask one of the
  servants here where I can find one."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff was conducted to a gloomy waiting room, on the table of which
  stood a small telephone instrument. He closed the door, but he was absent for
  only a few minutes. When he rejoined Lady Mary and her brother they were
  talking together in agitated whispers. The latter turned towards him at
  once.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that you suspect Count von Hern?" he asked, doubtfully. "He
  is a friend of the Danish Minister's, and every one says that he's such a
  good chap. He doesn't seem to take the slightest interest in
  politics&mdash;spends nearly all his time hunting or playing polo."</p>

  <p>"I don't suspect any one," Peter Ruff answered. "I only know that Count
  von Hern is an Austrian spy, and that he took your paper! Has he been out of
  your sight at all since you rejoined him in the sitting room? I mean to
  say&mdash;had he any opportunity of leaving you during the time you were
  dining together, or did he make any calls en route, either on the way to the
  Savoy or from the Savoy here?"</p>

  <p>The young man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"He has not been out of my sight for a second."</p>

  <p>"Who is the other man&mdash;Jermyn?" Peter Ruff asked. "I never heard of
  him."</p>

  <p>"An American&mdash;cousin of the Duchess. He could not have had the
  slightest interest in the affair."</p>

  <p>"Please take me into the ballroom," Peter Ruff said to Lady Mary. "Your
  brother had better not come with us. I want to be as near the Count von Hern
  as possible."</p>

  <p>They passed into the crowded rooms, unnoticed, purposely avoiding the
  little space where the Duchess was still receiving the late comers among her
  guests. They found progress difficult, and Lady Mary felt her heart sink as
  she glanced at the little jewelled watch which hung from her wrist. Suddenly
  Peter Ruff came to a standstill.</p>

  <p>"Don't look for a moment," he said, "but tell me as soon as you
  can&mdash;who is that tall young man, like a Goliath, talking to the little
  dark woman? You see whom I mean?"</p>

  <p>Lady Mary nodded, and they passed on. In a moment or two she answered
  him.</p>

  <p>"How strange that you should ask!" she whispered in his ear. "That is Mr.
  Jermyn."</p>

  <p>They were on the outskirts now of the ballroom itself. One of Lady Mary's
  partners came up with an open programme and a face full of reproach.</p>

  <p>"Do please forgive me, Captain Henderson," Lady Mary begged. "I have hurt
  my foot, and I am not dancing any more."</p>

  <p>"But surely I was to take you in to supper?" the young officer protested,
  good-humouredly. "Don't tell me that you are going to cut that?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to cut everything to-night with everybody," Lady Mary said.
  "Please forgive me. Come to tea to-morrow and I'll explain."</p>

  <p>The young man bowed, and, with a curious glance at Ruff, accepted his
  dismissal. Another partner was simply waved away.</p>

  <p>"Please turn round and come back," Peter Ruff said. "I want to see those
  two again."</p>

  <p>"But we haven't found Count von Hern yet," she protested. "Surely that is
  more important, is it not? I believe that I saw him dancing just
  now&mdash;there, with the tall girl in yellow."</p>

  <p>"Never mind about him, for the moment," Ruff answered. "Walk down this
  corridor with me. Do you mind talking all the time, please? It will sound
  more natural, and I want to listen."</p>

  <p>The young American and his partner had found a more retired seat now,
  about three quarters of the way down the pillared vestibule which bordered
  the ballroom. He was bending over his companion with an air of unmistakable
  devotion, but it was she who talked. She seemed, indeed, to have a good deal
  to say to him. The slim white fingers of one hand played all the time with a
  string of magnificent pearls. Her dark, soft eyes&mdash;black as aloes and
  absolutely un-English&mdash;flashed into his. A delightful smile hovered at
  the corners of her lips. All the time she was talking and he was listening.
  Lady Mary and her partner passed by unnoticed. At the end of the vestibule
  they turned and retraced their steps. Peter Ruff was very quiet&mdash;he had
  caught a few of those rapid words. But the woman's foreign accent had
  troubled him.</p>

  <p>"If only she would speak in her own language!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>Lady Mary's hand suddenly tightened upon his arm.</p>

  <p>"Look!" she exclaimed. "That is Count von Hern!"</p>

  <p>A tall, fair young man, very exact in his dress, very stiff in his
  carriage, with a not unpleasant face, was standing talking to Jermyn and his
  companion. Jermyn, who apparently found the intrusion an annoyance, was
  listening to the conversation between the two, with a frown upon his face and
  a general attitude of irritation. As Lady Mary and her escort drew near, the
  reason for the young American's annoyance became clearer&mdash;his two
  companions were talking softly, but with great animation, in a foreign
  language, which it was obvious that he did not understand. Peter Ruff's elbow
  pressed against his partner's arm, and their pace slackened. He ventured,
  even, to pause for a moment, looking into the ballroom as though in search of
  some one, and he had by no means the appearance of a man likely to understand
  Hungarian. Then, to Lady Mary's surprise, he touched the Count von Hern on
  the shoulder and addressed him.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir," he said, "but I fancy that we accidentally
  exchanged programmes, a few minutes ago, at the buffet. I have lost mine and
  picked up one which does not belong to me. As we were standing side by side,
  it is possibly yours."</p>

  <p>"I believe not, sir," he answered, with that pleasant smile which had gone
  such a long way toward winning him the reputation of being "a good fellow"
  amongst a fairly large circle of friends. "I believe at any rate," he added,
  glancing at his programme, "that this is my own. You mistake me, probably,
  for some one else."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff, without saying a word, was actor enough to suggest that he was
  unconvinced. The Count good-humouredly held out his programme.</p>

  <p>"You shall see for yourself," he remarked. "That is not yours, is it?
  Besides, I have not been to the buffet at all this evening."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff cast a swift glance down the programme which the Count had
  handed him. Then he apologised profusely.</p>

  <p>"I was mistaken," he admitted. "I am very sorry."</p>

  </div>

  <p>The Count bowed.</p>

  <p>"It is of no consequence, sir," he said, and resumed his conversation.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff passed on with Lady Mary. At a safe distance, she glanced at
  him enquiringly.</p>

  <p>"It was his programme I wanted to see," Peter Ruff explained. "It is as I
  thought. He has had four dances with the Countess&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who is she?" Lady Mary asked, quickly.</p>

  <p>"The little dark lady with whom he is talking now," Peter Ruff continued.
  "He seems, too, to be going early. He has no dances reserved after the
  twelfth. We will go downstairs at once, if you please. I must speak to your
  brother."</p>

  <p>"Have you been able to think of anything?" she asked, anxiously. "Is there
  any chance at all, do you think?"</p>

  <p>"I believe so," Peter Ruff answered. "It is most interesting. Don't be too
  sanguine, though. The odds are against us, and the time is very short. Is the
  driver of your electric brougham to be trusted?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," she assured him. "He is an old servant."</p>

  <p>"Will you lend him to me?" Peter Ruff asked, "and tell him that he is to
  obey my instructions absolutely?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," she answered. "You are going away, then?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded. He was a little sparing of words just then. The
  thoughts were chasing one another through his brain. He was listening, too,
  for the sweep of a dress behind.</p>

  <p>"Is there nothing I can do?" Lady Mary begged, eagerly.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head. In the distance he saw the Honourable Maurice
  come quickly toward them. With a firm but imperceptible gesture he waved him
  away.</p>

  <p>"Don't let your brother speak to me," he said. "We can't tell who is
  behind. What time did you say the Prime Minister was expected?"</p>

  <p>"At two o'clock," Lady Mary said, anxiously.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff glanced at his watch. It was already half an hour past
  midnight.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said, "I will do what I can. If my theory is wrong, it
  will be nothing. If I am right&mdash;well, there is a chance, anyhow. In the
  meantime&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In the meantime?" she repeated, breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Take your brother back to the ballroom," Peter Ruff directed. "Make him
  dance&mdash;dance yourself. Don't give yourselves away by looking anxious.
  When the time is short&mdash;say at a quarter to two&mdash;he can come down
  here and wait for me."</p>

  <p>"If you don't come!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Then we shall have lost," Peter Ruff said, calmly. "If you don't see me
  again to-night, you had better read the newspapers carefully for the next few
  days."</p>

  <p>"You are going to do something dangerous!" she protested.</p>

  <p>"There is danger in interfering at all in such a matter as this," he
  answered, "but you must remember that it is not only my profession&mdash;it
  is my hobby. Remember, too," he added, with a smile, "that I do not often
  lose!"</p>

  <p>For twenty minutes Peter Ruff sat in the remote corner of Lady Mary's
  electric brougham, drawn up at the other side of the Square, and waited. At
  last he pressed a button. They glided off. Before them was a large, closed
  motor car. They started in discreet chase.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, however, the chase was not a long one. The car which Peter
  Ruff had been following was drawn up before a plain, solid-looking house,
  unlit and of gloomy appearance. The little lady with the wonderful eyes was
  already halfway up the flagged steps. Hastily lifting the flap and looking
  behind as they passed, her pursuer saw her open the door with a latchkey, and
  disappear. Peter Ruff pulled the check-string and descended. For several
  moments he stood and observed the house into which the lady whom he had been
  following had disappeared. Then he turned to the driver.</p>

  <p>"I want you to watch that house," he said, "never to take your eyes off
  it. When I reappear from it, if I do at all, I shall probably be in a hurry.
  Directly you see me be on your box ready to start. A good deal may depend
  upon our getting away quickly."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir," the man answered. "How long am I to wait here for
  you?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff's lips twisted into a curious little smile.</p>

  <p>"Until two o'clock," he answered. "If I am not out by then, you needn't
  bother any more about me. You can return and tell your mistress exactly what
  has happened."</p>

  <p>"Hadn't I better come and try and get you out, sir?" the man asked.
  "Begging your pardon, but her Ladyship told me that there might be queer
  doings. I'm a bit useful in a scrap, sir," he added. "I do a bit of sparring
  regularly."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"If there's any scrap at all," he said, "you had better be out of it. Do
  as I have said."</p>

  <p>The motor car had turned round and disappeared now, and in a few moments
  Peter Ruff stood before the door of the house into which the little lady had
  disappeared. The problem of entrance was already solved for him. The door had
  been left unlatched; only a footstool had been placed against it inside.
  Peter Ruff, without hesitation, pushed the door softly open and entered,
  replaced the footstool in its former position, and stood with his back to the
  wall, in the darkest corner of the hall, looking around him&mdash;listening
  intently. Nearly opposite the door of a room stood ajar. It was apparently
  lit up, but there was no sound of any one moving inside. Upstairs, in one of
  the rooms on the first floor, he could hear light footsteps&mdash;a woman's
  voice humming a song. He listened to the first few bars, and understanding
  became easier. Those first few bars were the opening ones of the Servian
  national anthem!</p>

  <p>With an effort, Peter Ruff concentrated his thoughts upon the immediate
  present. The little lady was upstairs. The servants had apparently retired
  for the night. He crept up to the half-open door and peered in. The room, as
  he had hoped to find it, was empty, but Madame's easy-chair was drawn up to
  the fire, and some coffee stood upon the hob. Stealthily Peter Ruff crept in
  and glanced around, seeking for a hiding place. A movement upstairs hastened
  his decision. He pushed aside the massive curtains which separated this from
  a connecting room. He had scarcely done so when light footsteps were heard
  descending the stairs.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff found his hiding place all that could have been desired. This
  secondary room itself was almost in darkness, but he was just able to
  appreciate the comforting fact that it possessed a separate exit into the
  hall. Through the folds of the curtain he had a complete view of the further
  apartment. The little lady had changed her gown of stiff white satin for one
  of flimsier material, and, seated in the easy-chair, she was busy pouring
  herself out some coffee. She took a cigarette from a silver box, and lighting
  it, curled herself up in the chair and composed herself as though to listen.
  To her as well as to Peter Ruff, as he crouched in his hiding place, the
  moments seemed to pass slowly enough. Yet, as he realised afterward, it could
  not have been ten minutes before she sat upright in a listening attitude.
  There was some one coming! Peter Ruff, too, heard a man's firm footsteps come
  up the flagged stones.</p>

  <p>The little lady sprang to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Paul!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Paul Jermyn came slowly to meet her. He seemed a little out of breath. His
  tie was all disarranged and his collar unfastened.</p>

  <p>The little lady, however, noticed none of these things. She looked only
  into his face.</p>

  <p>"Have you got it?" she asked, eagerly.</p>

  <p>He thrust his hand into his breast-coat pocket, and held an envelope out
  toward her.</p>

  <p>"Sure!" he answered. "I promised!"</p>

  <p>She gave a little sob, and with the packet in her hand came running
  straight toward the spot where Peter Ruff was hiding.</p>

  <p>He shrank back as far as possible. She stopped just short of the curtain,
  opened the drawer of a table which stood there, and slipped the packet in.
  Then she came back once more to where Paul Jermyn was standing.</p>

  <p>"My friend!" she cried, holding out her hands&mdash;"my dear, dear friend!
  Shall I ever be able to thank you enough?"</p>

  <p>"Why, if you try," he answered, smiling, "I think that you could!"</p>

  <p>She laid her hand upon his arm&mdash;a little caressing, foreign
  gesture.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she said, "how did you manage it?"</p>

  <p>"We left the dance together," Jermyn said. "I could see that he wanted to
  get rid of me, but I offered to take him in my motor car. I told the man to
  choose some back streets, and while we were passing through one of them, I
  took Von Hern by the throat. We had a struggle, of course, but I got the
  paper."</p>

  <p>"What did you do with Von Hern?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I left him on his doorstep," the young American answered. "He wasn't
  really hurt, but he was only half conscious. I don't think he'll bother any
  one to-night."</p>

  <p>"You dear, brave man!" she murmured. "Paul, what am I to say to you?"</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"That's what I'm here to ask," he declared. "You wouldn't give me my
  answer at the ball. Perhaps you'll give it me now?"</p>

  <p>They sprang apart. Ruff felt his nerves stiffen&mdash;felt himself
  constrained to hold even his breath as he widened a little the crack in the
  curtains. This was no stealthy entrance. The door had been flung open. Von
  Hern, his dress in wild disorder, pale as a ghost, and with a great
  bloodstain upon his cheek, stood confronting them.</p>

  <p>"When you have done with your love-making," he called out, "I'll trouble
  you to restore my property!"</p>

  <p>The electric light gleamed upon a small revolver which flashed out toward
  the young American. Paul Jermyn never hesitated for a moment. He seized the
  chair by his side and flung it at Von Hern. There was a shot, the crash of
  the falling chair, a cry from Jermyn, who never hesitated, however, in his
  rush. The two men closed. A second shot went harmlessly to the ceiling. The
  little lady stole away&mdash;stole softly across the room toward the table.
  She opened the drawer. Suddenly the blood in her veins was frozen into fear.
  From nowhere, it seemed to her, came a hand which held her wrists like
  iron!</p>

  <p>"Madam," Peter Ruff whispered from behind the curtain, "I am sorry to
  deprive you of it, but this is stolen property."</p>

  <p>Her screams rang through the room. Even the two men released one
  another.</p>

  <p>"It is gone! It is gone!" she cried. "Some one was hiding in the room!
  Quick!"</p>

  <p>She sprang into the hall. The two men followed her. The front door was
  slammed. They heard flying footsteps outside. Von Hern was out first,
  clearing the little flight of steps in one bound. Across the road he saw a
  flying figure. A level stream of fire poured from his hand&mdash;twice, three
  times. But Peter Ruff never faltered. Round the corner he tore. The man had
  kept his word&mdash;the brougham was already moving slowly.</p>

  <p>"Jump in, sir," the man cried. "Throw yourself in. Never mind about the
  door."</p>

  <p>They heard the shouts behind. Peter Ruff did as he was bid, and sat upon
  the floor, raising himself gradually to the seat when they had turned another
  corner. Then he put his head out of the window.</p>

  <p>"Back to the Duchess of Montford's!" he ordered.</p>

  <p>The latest of the guests had ceased to arrive&mdash;a few were already
  departing. It was an idle time, however, with the servants who loitered in
  the vestibules of Montford House, and they looked with curiosity upon this
  strange guest who arrived at five minutes to two, limping a little, and
  holding his left arm in his right hand. One footman on the threshold nearly
  addressed him, but the words were taken out of his mouth when he saw Lady
  Mary and her brother&mdash;the Honorable Maurice Sotherst&mdash;hasten
  forward to greet him.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff smiled upon them benignly.</p>

  <p>"You can take the paper out of my breast-coat pocket," he said.</p>

  <p>The young man's fingers gripped it. Through Lady Mary's great
  thankfulness, however, the sudden fear came shivering.</p>

  <p>"You are hurt!" she whispered. "There is blood on your sleeve."</p>

  <p>"Just a graze," Peter Ruff answered. "Von Hern wasn't much good at a
  running target. Back to the ballroom, young man," he added. "Don't you see
  who's coming?"</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister came up the tented way into Montford House. He, too,
  wondered a little at the man whom he met on his way out, holding his left
  arm, and looking more as though he had emerged from a street fight than from
  the Duchess of Montford's ball. Peter Ruff went home smiling.</p>

  <h2>VII. THE DEMAND OF THE DOUBLE-FOUR<br>
  <small>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Mar
  1910</small></h2>

  <p class="first">It was about this time that Peter Ruff found among his
  letters one morning a highly-scented little missive, addressed to him in a
  handwriting with which he had once been familiar. He looked at it for several
  moments before opening it. Even as the paper cutter slid through the top of
  the envelope, he felt that he had already divined the nature of its
  contents.</p>

  <p class="letter">FRIVOLITY THEATRE<br>
  March 10th</p>

  <p class="letter">MY DEAR Mr. RUFF:&mdash; I expect that you will be
  surprised to hear from me again, but I do hope that you will not be annoyed.
  I know that I behaved very horridly a little time ago, but it was not
  altogether my fault, and I have been more sorry for it than I can tell
  you&mdash;in fact, John and I have never been the same since, and for the
  present, at any rate, I have left him and gone on the stage. A lady whom I
  knew got me a place in the chorus here, and so far I like it immensely.<br>
  <br>
  Won't you come and meet me after the show to-morrow night, and I will tell
  you all about it? I should like so much to see you again.<br>
  <br>
  MAUD.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff placed this letter in his breast-coat pocket, and withheld it
  from his secretary's notice. He felt, however, very little pleasure at the
  invitation it conveyed. He hesitated for some time, in fact, whether to
  accept it or not. Finally, after his modest dinner that evening, he bought a
  stall for the Frivolity and watched the piece. The girl he had come to see
  was there in the second row of the chorus, but she certainly did not look her
  best in the somewhat scant costume required by the part. She showed no signs
  whatever of any special ability&mdash;neither her dancing nor her singing
  seemed to entitle her to any consideration. She carried herself with a
  certain amount of self-consciousness, and her eyes seemed perpetually fixed
  upon the occupants of the stalls. Peter Ruff laid down his glasses with
  something between a sigh and a groan. There was something to him
  inexpressibly sad in the sight of his old sweetheart so transformed, so
  utterly changed from the prim, somewhat genteel young person who had accepted
  his modest advances with such ladylike diffidence. She seemed, indeed, to
  have lost those very gifts which had first attracted him. Nevertheless, he
  kept his appointment at the stage-door.</p>

  <p>She was among the first to come out, and she greeted him
  warmly&mdash;almost noisily. With her new profession, she seemed to have
  adopted a different and certainly more flamboyant deportment.</p>

  <p>"I thought you'd come to-night," she declared, with an arch look. "I felt
  certain I saw you in the stalls. You are going to take me to supper, aren't
  you? Shall we go to the Milan?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff assented without enthusiasm, handed her into a hansom, and took
  his place beside her. She wore a very large hat, untidily put on; some of the
  paint seemed still to be upon her face; her voice, too, seemed to have become
  louder, and her manner more assertive. There were obvious indications that
  she no longer considered brandy and soda an unladylike beverage. Peter Ruff
  was not pleased with himself or proud of his companion.</p>

  <p>"You'll take some wine?" he suggested, after he had ordered, with a few
  hints from her, a somewhat extensive supper.</p>

  <p>"Champagne," she answered, decidedly. "I've got quite used to it,
  nowadays," she went on. "I could laugh to think how strange it tasted when
  you first took me out."</p>

  <p>"Tell me," Peter Ruff said, "why you have left your husband?"</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"Because he was dull and because he was cross," she answered, "and because
  the life down at Streatham was simply intolerable. I think it was a little
  your fault, too," she said, making eyes; at him across the table. "You gave
  me a taste of what life was like outside Streatham, and I never forgot
  it."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff did not respond&mdash;he led the conversation, indeed, into
  other channels. On the whole, the supper was scarcely a success. Maud, who
  was growing to consider herself something of a Bohemian, and who certainly
  looked for some touch of sentiment on the part of her old admirer, was
  annoyed by the quiet deference with which he treated her. She reproached him
  with it once, bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Say," she exclaimed, "you don't seem to want to be so friendly as you
  did! You haven't forgiven me yet, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is not that," he said, "but I think that you have scarcely done a wise
  thing in leaving your husband. I cannot think that this life on the stage is
  good for you."</p>

  <p>She laughed, scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, "I never thought to have you preaching at me!"</p>

  <p>They finished their supper. Maud accepted a cigarette and did her best to
  change her companion's mood. She only alluded once more to her husband.</p>

  <p>"I don't see how I could have stayed with him, anyhow," she said. "You
  know, he's been put back&mdash;he only gets two pounds fifteen a week now. He
  couldn't expect me to live upon that."</p>

  <p>"Put back?" Peter Ruff repeated.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"He seemed to have a lot of bad luck this last year," she said. "All his
  cases went wrong, and they don't think so much of him at Scotland Yard as
  they did. I am not sure that he hasn't begun to drink a little."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to hear it," Peter Ruff said, gravely.</p>

  <p>"I don't see why you should be," she answered, bluntly. "He was no friend
  of yours, nor isn't now. He may not be so dangerous as he was, but if ever
  you come across him, you take my tip and be careful. He means to do you a
  mischief some day, if he can. I am not sure," she added, "that he doesn't
  believe that it was partly your fault about my leaving home."</p>

  <p>"I should be sorry for him to think that," Peter Ruff answered. "While we
  are upon the subject, can't you tell me exactly why your husband dislikes me
  so?"</p>

  <p>"For one thing, because you have been up against him in several of his
  cases, and have always won."</p>

  <p>"And for the other?"</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, doubtfully, "he seems to connect you in his mind,
  somehow, with a boy who was in love with me once&mdash;Mr. Spencer
  Fitzgerald&mdash;you know who I mean."</p>

  <p>Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"He still has that in his mind, has he?" he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's mad!" she declared. "However, don't let us talk about him any
  more."</p>

  <p>The lights were being put out. Peter Ruff paid his bill and they rose
  together.</p>

  <p>"Come down to the fiat for an hour or so," she begged, taking his arm. "I
  have a dear little place with another girl&mdash;Carrie Pearce. I'll sing to
  you, if you like. Come down and have one drink, anyhow."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head firmly.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said, "but you must excuse me. In some ways, I am very
  old-fashioned," he added. "I never sit up late, and I hate music."</p>

  <p>"Just drive as far as the door with me, then," she begged.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You must excuse me," he said, handing her into the hansom. "And, Maud,"
  he added&mdash;"if I may call you so&mdash;take my advice: give it
  up&mdash;go back to your husband and stick to him&mdash;you'll be better off
  in the long run."</p>

  <p>She would have answered him scornfully, but there was something impressive
  in the crisp, clear words&mdash;in his expression, too, as he looked into her
  eyes. She threw herself back in a corner of the cab with an affected little
  laugh, and turned her head away from him.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff walked back into the cloak-room for his coat and hat, and
  sighed softly to himself. It was the end of the one sentimental episode of
  his life!</p>

  <p>It had been the study of Peter Ruff's life, so far as possible, to
  maintain under all circumstances an equable temperament, to refuse to
  recognize the meaning of the word "nerves," and to be guided in all his
  actions by that profound common sense which was one of his natural gifts. Yet
  there were times when, like any other ordinary person, he suffered acutely
  from presentiments. He left his rooms, for instance, at five o'clock on the
  afternoon of the day following his supper with Maud, suffering from a sense
  of depression for which he found it altogether impossible to account. It was
  true that the letter which he had in his pocket, the appointment which he was
  on his way to keep, were both of them probable sources of embarrassment and
  annoyance, if not of danger. He was being invited, without the option of
  refusal, to enter upon some risky undertaking which would yield him neither
  fee nor reward. Yet his common sense told him that it was part of the game.
  In Paris, he had looked upon his admittance into the order of the
  "Double-Four" as one of the stepping-stones to success in his career. Through
  them he had gained knowledge which he could have acquired in no other way.
  Through them, for instance, he had acquired the information that Madame la
  Comtesse de Pilitz was a Servian patriot and a friend of the Crown Prince;
  and that the Count von Hern, posing in England as a sportsman and an idler,
  was a highly paid and dangerous Austrian spy. There had been other occasions,
  too, upon which they had come to his aid. Now they had made an appeal to
  him&mdash;an appeal which must be obeyed. His time&mdash;perhaps, even, his
  safety&mdash;must be placed entirely at their disposal. It was only an
  ordinary return a thing expected of him&mdash;a thing which he dared not
  refuse. Yet he knew very well what he could not explain to them&mdash;that
  the whole success of his life depended so absolutely upon his remaining free
  from any suspicion of wrong-doing, that he had received his summons with
  something like dismay, and proceeded to obey it with unaccustomed
  reluctance.</p>

  <p>He drove to Cirey's cafe in Regent Street, where he dismissed the driver
  of his hansom and strolled in with the air of an habitue. He selected a
  corner table, ordered some refreshment, and asked for a box of dominoes. The
  place was fairly well filled. A few women were sitting about; a sprinkling of
  Frenchmen were taking their aperitif; here and there a man of affairs, on his
  way from the city, had called in for a glass of vermouth. Peter Ruff looked
  them over, recognizing the type&mdash;recognizing, even, some of their faces.
  Apparently, the person whom he was to meet had not yet arrived.</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette and smoked slowly. Presently the door opened and a
  woman entered in a long fur coat, a large hat, and a thick veil. She raised
  it to glance around, disclosing the unnaturally pale face and dark, swollen
  eyes of a certain type of Frenchwoman. She seemed to notice no one in
  particular. Her eyes traveled over Peter Ruff without any sign of interest.
  Nevertheless, she took a seat somewhere near his and ordered some vermouth
  from the waiter, whom she addressed by name. When she had been served and the
  waiter had departed, she looked curiously at the dominoes which stood before
  her neighbor.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur plays dominoes, perhaps?" she remarked, taking one of them into
  her fingers and examining it. "A very interesting game!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff showed her a domino which he had been covering with his
  hand&mdash;it was a double four. She nodded, and moved from her seat to one
  immediately next him.</p>

  <p>"I had not imagined," Peter Ruff said, "that it was a lady whom I was to
  meet."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur is not disappointed, I trust?" she said, smiling. "If I talk
  banalities, Monsieur must pardon it. Both the waiters here are spies, and
  there are always people who watch. Monsieur is ready to do us a service?"</p>

  <p>"To the limits of my ability," Peter Ruff answered. "Madame will remember
  that we are not in Paris; that our police system, if not so wonderful as
  yours, is still a closer and a more present thing. They have not the brains
  at Scotland Yard, but they are persistent&mdash;hard to escape."</p>

  <p>"Do I not know it?" the woman said. "It is through them that we send for
  you. One of us is in danger."</p>

  <p>"Do I know him?" Peter Ruff asked.</p>

  <p>"It is doubtful," she answered. "Monsieur's stay in Paris was so brief. If
  Monsieur will recognize his name&mdash;it is Jean Lemaitre himself."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff started slightly.</p>

  <p>"I thought," he said, with some hesitation, "that Lemaitre did not visit
  this country."</p>

  <p>"He came well disguised," the woman answered. "It was thought to be safe.
  Nevertheless, it was a foolish thing. They have tracked him down from hotel
  to apartments, till he lives now in the back room of a wretched little cafe
  in Soho. Even from there we cannot get him away&mdash;the whole district is
  watched by spies. We need help."</p>

  <p>"For a genius like Lemaitre," Peter Ruff said, thoughtfully, "to have even
  thought of Soho, was foolish. He should have gone to Hampstead or Balham. It
  is easy to fool our police if you know how. On the other hand, they hang on
  to the scent like leeches when once they are on the trail. How many warrants
  are there out against Jean in this country?"</p>

  <p>"Better not ask that," the woman said, grimly. "You remember the raid on a
  private house in the Holloway Road, two years ago, when two policemen were
  shot and a spy was stabbed? Jean was in that&mdash;it is sufficient!"</p>

  <p>"Are any plans made at all?" Peter Ruff asked.</p>

  <p>"But naturally," the woman answered. "There is a motor car, even now, of
  sixty-horse-power, stands ready at a garage in Putney. If Jean can once reach
  it, he can reach the coast. At a certain spot near Southampton there is a
  small steamer waiting. After that, everything is easy."</p>

  <p>"My task, then," Peter Ruff said, thoughtfully, "is to take Jean Lemaitre
  from this cafe in Soho, as far as Putney, and get him a fair start?"</p>

  <p>"It is enough," she answered. "There is a cordon of spies around the
  district. Every day they seem to chose in upon us. They search the houses,
  one by one. Only last night, the Hotel de Netherlands&mdash;a miserable
  little place on the other side of the street&mdash;was suddenly surrounded by
  policemen and every room ransacked. It may be our turn to-night."</p>

  <p>"In one hour's time," Peter Ruff said, glancing at his watch, "I shall
  present myself as a doctor at the cafe. Tell me the address. Tell me what to
  say which will insure my admission to Jean Lemaitre!"</p>

  <p>"The cafe," she answered, "is called the Hotel de Flandres. You enter the
  restaurant and you walk to the desk. There you find always Monsieur Antoine.
  You say to him simply&mdash;'The Double-Four!' He will answer that he
  understands, and he will conduct you at once to Lemaitre."</p>

  <p>Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"In the meantime," he said, "let it be understood in the cafe&mdash;if
  there is any one who is not in the secret&mdash;that one of the waiters is
  sick. I shall come to attend him."</p>

  <p>She nodded thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"As well that way as any other," she answered. "Monsieur is very kind. A
  bientot!"</p>

  <p>She shook hands and they parted. Peter Ruff drove back to his rooms, rang
  up an adjoining garage for a small covered car such as are usually let out to
  medical men, and commenced to pack a small black bag with the outfit
  necessary for his purpose. Now that he was actually immersed in his work, the
  sense of depression had passed away. The keen stimulus of danger had
  quickened his blood. He knew very well that the woman had not exaggerated.
  There was no man more wanted by the French or the English police than the man
  who had sought his aid, and the district in which he had taken shelter was,
  in some respects, the very worst for his purpose. Nevertheless, Peter Ruff,
  who believed, at the bottom of his heart, in his star, went on with his
  preparations feeling morally certain that Jean Lemaitre would sleep on the
  following night in his native land.</p>

  <p>At precisely the hour agreed upon, a small motor brougham pulled up
  outside the door of the Hotel de Flandres and its occupant&mdash;whom
  ninety-nine men out of a hundred would at once, unhesitatingly, have declared
  to be a doctor in moderate practice&mdash;pushed open the swing doors of the
  restaurant and made his way to the desk. He was of medium height; he wore a
  frock-coat&mdash;a little frayed; gray trousers which had not been recently
  pressed; and thick boots.</p>

  <p>"I understand that one of your waiters requires my attendance," he said,
  in a tone not unduly raised but still fairly audible. "I am Dr. Gilette."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Gilette," Antoine repeated, slowly.</p>

  <p>"And number Double-Four," the doctor murmured.</p>

  <p>Antoine descended from his desk.</p>

  <p>"But certainly, Monsieur!" he said. "The poor fellow declares that he
  suffers. If he is really ill, he must go. It sounds brutal, but what can one
  do? We have so few rooms here, and so much business. Monsieur will come this
  way?"</p>

  <p>Antoine led the way from the cafe into a very smelly region of narrow
  passages and steep stairs.</p>

  <p>"It is to be arranged?" Antoine whispered, as they ascended.</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt," the doctor answered. "Were there spies in the
  cafe?"</p>

  <p>"Two," Antoine answered.</p>

  <p>The doctor nodded, and said no more. He mounted to the third story.
  Antoine led him through a small sitting-room and knocked four times upon the
  door of an inner room. It suddenly was opened. A man&mdash;unshaven,
  terrified, with that nameless fear in his face which one sees reflected in
  the expression of some trapped animal&mdash;stood there looking out at
  them.</p>

  <p>"'Double-Four'!" the doctor said, softly. "Go back into the room, please.
  Antoine will kindly leave us."</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" the man gasped.</p>

  <p>"'Double-Four'!" the doctor answered. "Obey me, and be quick for your
  life! Strip!"</p>

  <p>The man obeyed.</p>

  <p>Barely twenty minutes later, the doctor&mdash;still carrying his
  bag&mdash;descended the stairs. He entered the cafe from a somewhat remote
  door. Antoine hurried to meet him, and walked by his side through the place.
  He asked many questions, but the doctor contented himself with shaking his
  head. Almost in silence he left Antoine, who conducted him even to the door
  of his motor. The proprietor of the cafe watched the brougham disappear, and
  then returned to his desk, sighing heavily.</p>

  <p>A man who had been sipping a liqueur dose at hand, laid down his
  paper.</p>

  <p>"One of your waiters ill, did I understand?" he asked. Monsieur Antoine
  was at once eloquent. It was the ill-fortune which had dogged him for the
  last four months! The man had been taken ill there in the restaurant. He was
  a Gascon&mdash;spoke no English&mdash;and had just arrived. It was not
  possible for him to be removed at the moment, so he had been carried to an
  empty bedroom. Then had come the doctor and forbidden his removal. Now for a
  week he had lain there and several of his other voyageurs had departed. One
  did not know how these things got about, but they spoke of infection. The
  doctor, who had just left&mdash;Dr. Gilette of Russell Square, a most famous
  physician&mdash;had assured him that there was no infection&mdash;no fear of
  any. But what did it matter&mdash;that? People were so hard to convince.
  Monsieur would like a cigar? But certainly! There were here some of the
  best.</p>

  <p>Antoine undid the cabinet and opened a box of Havanas. John Dory selected
  one and called for another liqueur.</p>

  <p>"You have trouble often with your waiters, I dare say," he remarked. "They
  tell me that all Frenchmen who break the law in their own country, find their
  way, sooner or later, to these parts. You have to take them without
  characters, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>Antoine lifted his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"But what could one do?" he exclaimed. "Characters, they were easy enough
  to write&mdash;but were they worth the paper they were written on? Indeed
  no!"</p>

  <p>"Not only your waiters," Dory continued, "but those who stay in the hotels
  round here have sometimes an evil name."</p>

  <p>Antoine shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"For myself," he said, "I am particular. We have but a few rooms, but we
  are careful to whom we let them."</p>

  <p>"Do you keep a visitors' book?"</p>

  <p>"But no, Monsieur!" Antoine protested. "For why the necessity? There are
  so few who come to stay for more than the night&mdash;just now scarcely any
  one at all."</p>

  <p>There entered, at that moment, a tall, thin man dressed in dark clothes,
  who walked with his hands in his overcoat pockets, as though it were a habit.
  He came straight to Dory and handed him a piece of paper.</p>

  <p>John Dory glanced it through and rose to his feet. A gleam of satisfaction
  lit his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Antoine," he said, "I am sorry to cause you any inconvenience,
  but here is my card. I am a detective officer from Scotland Yard, and I have
  received information which compels me with your permission, to examine at
  once the sleeping apartments in your hotel."</p>

  <p>Antoine was fiercely indignant.</p>

  <p>"But, Monsieur!" he exclaimed. "I do not understand! Examine my rooms? But
  it is impossible! Who dares to say that I harbor criminals?"</p>

  <p>"I have information upon which I can rely," John Dory answered, firmly.
  "This comes from a man who is no friend of mine, but he is well-known. You
  can read for yourself what he says."</p>

  <p>Monsieur Antoine, with trembling fingers, took the piece of paper from
  John Dory's hands. It was addressed to&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">Mr. JOHN DORY, DETECTIVE:<br>
  If you wish to find Jean Lemaitre, search in the upper rooms of the Hotel de
  Flandres. I have certain information that he is to be found there.<br>
  PETER RUFF.</p>

  <p>"Never," Antoine declared, "will I suffer such an indignity!"</p>

  <p>Dory raised a police whistle to his lips.</p>

  <p>"You are foolish," he said. "Already there is a cordon of men about the
  place. If you refuse to conduct me upstairs I shall at once place you under
  arrest."</p>

  <p>Antoine, white with fear, poured himself out a liqueur of brandy.</p>

  <p>"Well, well," he said, "what must be done, then! Come!"</p>

  <p>He led the way out into that smelly network of passages, up the stairs to
  the first floor. Room after room he threw open and begged Dory to examine.
  Some of them were garishly furnished with gilt mirrors, cheap lace curtains
  tied back with blue ribbons. Others were dark, miserable holes, into which
  the fresh air seemed never to have penetrated. On the third floor they
  reached the little sitting-room, which bore more traces of occupation than
  some of the rooms below. Antoine would have passed on, but Dory stopped
  him.</p>

  <p>"There is a door there," he said. "We will try that."</p>

  <p>"It is the sick waiter who lies within," Antoine protested. "Monsieur can
  hear him groan."</p>

  <p>There was, indeed, something which sounded like a groan to be heard, but
  Dory was obstinate.</p>

  <p>"If he is so ill," he demanded, "how is he able to lock the door on the
  inside? Monsieur Antoine, that door must be opened."</p>

  <p>Antoine knocked at it softly.</p>

  <p>"Francois," he said, "there is another doctor here who would see you. Let
  us in."</p>

  <p>There was no answer, Antoine turned to his companion with a little shrug
  of the shoulders, as one who would say&mdash;"I have done my best. What would
  you have?"</p>

  <p>Dory put his shoulder to the door.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he shouted through the keyhole, "Mr. Sick Waiter, or whoever you
  are, if you do not unlock this door, I am coming in!"</p>

  <p>"I have no key," said a faint voice. "I am locked in. Please break open
  the door."</p>

  <p>"But that is not the Voice of Francois!" Antoine exclaimed, in
  amazement.</p>

  <p>"We'll soon see who it is," Dory answered.</p>

  <p>He charged at the door fiercely. At the third assault it gave way. They
  found themselves in a small back bedroom, and stretched on the floor, very
  pale, and apparently only half-conscious, lay Peter Ruff. There was a strong
  smell of chloroform about. John Dory threw open the window. His fingers
  trembled a little. It was like Fate&mdash;this! At the end of every
  unsuccessful effort there was this man&mdash;Peter Ruff!</p>

  <p>"What the devil are you doing here?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff groaned.</p>

  <p>"Help me up," he begged, "and give me a little brandy."</p>

  <p>Antoine set him in an easy-chair and rang the bell furiously.</p>

  <p>"It will come directly!" he exclaimed. "But who are you?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff waited for the brandy. When he had sipped it, he drew a little
  breath as though of relief.</p>

  <p>"I heard," he said, speaking still with an evident effort, "that Lemaitre
  was here. I had secret information. I thought at first that I would let you
  know&mdash;I sent you a note early this morning. Afterwards, I discovered
  that there was a reward, and I determined to track him down myself. He was in
  here hiding as a sick waiter. I do not think," Peter Ruff added, "that
  Monsieur Antoine had any idea. I presented myself as representing a
  charitable society, and I was shown here to visit him. He was too clever,
  though, was Jean Lemaitre&mdash;too quick for me."</p>

  <p>"You were a fool to come alone!" John Dory said. "Don't you know the man's
  record? How long ago did he leave?"</p>

  <p>"About ten minutes," Peter Ruff answered. "You must have missed him
  somewhere as you came up. I crawled to the window and I watched him go. He
  left the restaurant by the side entrance, and took a taxicab at the corner
  there. It went northward toward New Oxford Street."</p>

  <p>Dory turned on his heel&mdash;they heard him descending the stairs. Peter
  Ruff rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, as he plunged his head into a basin of water, and
  came into the middle of the room rubbing it vigorously with a small towel, "I
  am afraid that our friend John Dory will get to dislike me soon! He passed
  out unnoticed, eh, Antoine?"</p>

  <p>Antoine's face wore a look of great relief.</p>

  <p>"There was not a soul who looked," he said. "We passed under the nose of
  the gentleman from Scotland Yard. He sat there reading his paper; and he had
  no idea. I watched Jean step into the motor. Even by now he is well on his
  way southwards. Twice he changes from motor to train, and back. They will
  never trace him."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff, who was looking amazingly better, sipped a further glass of
  liqueur. Together he and Antoine descended to the street.</p>

  <p>"Mind," Peter Ruff whispered, "I consider that accounts are squared
  between me and 'Double-Four' now. Let them know that. This sort of thing
  isn't in my line."</p>

  <p>"For an amateur," Antoine said, bowing low, "Monsieur commands my
  heartfelt congratulations!"</p>

  <h2>VIII. Mrs. BOGNOR'S STAR BOARDER<br>
  <small>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Apr
  1910</small></h2>

  <p class="first">In these days, the duties of Miss Brown as Peter Ruff's
  secretary had become multifarious. Together with the transcribing of a vast
  number of notes concerning cases, some of which he undertook and some of
  which he refused, she had also to keep his cash book, a note of his
  investments and a record of his social engagements. Notwithstanding all these
  demands upon her time, however, there were occasions when she found herself,
  of necessity, idle. In one of these she broached the subject which had often
  been in her mind. They were alone, and not expecting callers. Consequently,
  she sat upon the hearthrug and addressed her employer by his Christian
  name.</p>

  <p>"Peter," she said softly, "do you remember the night when you came through
  the fog and burst into my little flat?"</p>

  <p>"Quite well," he answered, "but it is a subject to which I prefer that you
  do not allude."</p>

  <p>"I will be careful," she answered. "I only spoke of it for this reason.
  Before you left, when we were sitting together, you sketched out the career
  which you proposed for yourself. In many respects, I suppose, you have been
  highly successful, but I wonder if it has ever occurred to you that your work
  has not proceeded upon the lines which you first indicated?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I think I know what you mean," he said. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"That night," she murmured softly, "you spoke as a hunted man; you spoke
  as one at war with Society; you spoke as one who proposes almost a campaign
  against it. When you took your rooms here and called yourself Peter Ruff, it
  was rather in your mind to aid the criminal than to detect the crime. Fate
  seems to have decreed otherwise. Why, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>"Things have gone that way," Peter Ruff remarked.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you why," she continued. "It is because, at the bottom of
  your heart, there lurks a strong and unconquerable desire for respectability.
  In your heart you are on the side of the law and established things. You do
  not like crime; you do not like criminals. You do not like the idea of
  associating with them. You prefer the company of law-abiding people, even
  though their ways be narrow. It was part of that sentiment, Peter, which led
  you to fall in love with a coal-merchant's daughter. I can see that you will
  end your days in the halo of respectability."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff was a little thoughtful. He scratched his chin and contemplated
  the tip of his faultless patent boot. Self-analysis interested him, and he
  recognized the truth of the girl's words.</p>

  <p>"You know, I am rather like that," he admitted. "When I see a family
  party, I envy them. When I hear of a man who has brothers and sisters and
  aunts and cousins, and gives family dinner-parties to family friends, I envy
  him. I do not care about the loose ends of life. I do not care about
  restaurant life, and ladies who transfer their regards with the same facility
  that they change their toilettes. You have very admirable powers of
  observation, Violet. You see me, I believe, as I really am."</p>

  <p>"That being so," she remarked, "what are you going to say to Sir Richard
  Dyson?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff was frank.</p>

  <p>"Upon my soul," he answered, "I don't know!"</p>

  <p>"You'll have to make up your mind very soon," she reminded him. "He is
  coming here at twelve o'clock."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"I shall wait until I hear what he has to say," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"His letter gave you a pretty clear hint," Violet said, "that it was
  something outside the law."</p>

  <p>"The law has many outposts," Peter Ruff said. "One can thread one's way in
  and out, if one knows the ropes. I don't like the man, but he introduced me
  to his tailor. I have never had any clothes like those he has made me."</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"You are a vain little person," she said.</p>

  <p>"You are an impertinent young woman!" he answered. "Get back to your work.
  Don't you hear the lift stop?"</p>

  <p>She rose reluctantly, and resumed her place in front of her desk.</p>

  <p>"If it's risky," she whispered, leaning round towards him, "don't you take
  it on. I've heard one or two things about Sir Richard lately."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded. He, too, quitted his easy-chair, and took up a bundle
  of papers which lay upon his desk. There was a sharp tap at the door.</p>

  <p>"Come in!" he said.</p>

  <p>Sir Richard Dyson entered. He was dressed quietly, but with the perfect
  taste which was obviously an instinct with him, and he wore a big bunch of
  violets in his buttonhole. Nevertheless, the spring sunshine seemed to find
  out the lines in his face. His eyes were baggy&mdash;he had aged even within
  the last few months.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Ruff," he said, shaking hands, "how goes it?"</p>

  <p>"I am very well, Sir Richard," Peter Ruff answered. "Please take a
  chair."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard took the easy-chair, and discovering a box of cigarettes upon
  the table, helped himself. Then his eyes fell upon Miss Brown.</p>

  <p>"Can't do without your secretary?" he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" Peter Ruff answered. "As I told you before, I am her
  guarantee that what you say to me, or before her, is spoken as though to the
  dead."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard nodded.</p>

  <p>"Just as well," he remarked, "for I am going to talk about a man who I
  wish were dead!"</p>

  <p>"There are few of us," Peter Ruff said, "who have not our enemies."</p>

  <p>"Have you any experience of blackmailers?" Sir Richard asked.</p>

  <p>"In my profession," Peter Ruff answered, "I have come across such
  persons."</p>

  <p>"I have come to see you about one," Sir Richard proceeded. "Many years
  ago, there was a fellow in my regiment who went to the bad&mdash;never mind
  his name. He passes to-day as Ted Jones&mdash;that name will do as well as
  another. I am not," Sir Richard continued, "a good-natured man, but some
  devilish impulse prompted me to help that fellow. I gave him money three or
  four times. Somehow, I don't think it's a very good thing to give a man
  money. He doesn't value it&mdash;it comes too easily. He spends it and wants
  more."</p>

  <p>"There's a good deal of truth in what you say, Sir Richard," Peter Ruff
  admitted.</p>

  <p>"Our friend, for instance, wanted more," Sir Richard continued. "He came
  to me for it almost as a matter of course. I refused. He came again; I lost
  my temper and punched his head. Then his little game began."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"He had something to work upon, I suppose?" he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Most certainly he had," Sir Richard admitted. "If ever I achieved
  sufficient distinction in any branch of life to make it necessary that my
  biography should be written, I promise you that you would find it in many
  places a little highly colored. In other words, Mr. Ruff, I have not always
  adhered to the paths of righteousness."</p>

  <p>A faint smile flickered across Peter Ruff's face.</p>

  <p>"Sir Richard," he said, "your candor is admirable."</p>

  <p>"There was one time," Sir Richard continued, "when I was really on my last
  legs. It was just before I came into the baronetcy. I had borrowed every
  penny I could borrow. I was even hard put to it for a meal. I went to Paris,
  and I called myself by another man's name. I got introduced to a somewhat
  exclusive club there. My assumed name was a good one&mdash;it was the name,
  in fact, of a relative whom I somewhat resembled. I was accepted without
  question. I played cards, and I lost somewhere about eighteen thousand
  francs."</p>

  <p>"A sum," Peter Ruff remarked, "which you probably found it inconvenient to
  pay."</p>

  <p>"There was only one course," Sir Richard continued, "and I took it. I went
  back the next night and gave checks for the amount of my
  indebtedness&mdash;checks which had no more chance of being met than if I
  were to draw to-night upon the Bank of England for a million pounds. I went
  back, however, with another resolve. I was considered to have discharged my
  liabilities, and we played again. I rose a winner of something like sixty
  thousand francs. But I played to win, Mr. Ruff! Do you know what that
  means?"</p>

  <p>"You cheated!" Peter Ruff said, in an undertone.</p>

  <p>"Quite true," Sir Richard admitted. "I cheated! There was a scandal, and I
  disappeared. I had the money, and though my checks for the eighteen thousand
  francs were met, there was a considerable balance in my pocket when I escaped
  out of France. There was enough to take me out to America&mdash;big game
  shooting in the far West. No one ever associated me with the impostor who had
  robbed these young French noblemen&mdash;no one, that is to say, except the
  person who passes by the name of Teddy Jones."</p>

  <p>"How did he get to know?" Peter Ruff asked.</p>

  <p>"The story wouldn't interest you," Sir Richard answered. "He was in Paris
  at the time&mdash;we came across one another twice. He heard the scandal, and
  put two and two together. I shipped him off to Australia when I came into the
  title. He has come back. Lately, I can tell you, he has pretty well drained
  me dry. He has become a regular parasite a cold-blooded leech. He doesn't get
  drunk now. He looks after his health. I believe he even saves his, money.
  There's scarcely a week I don't hear from him. He keeps me a pauper. He has
  brought me at last to that state when I feel that there must be an
  ending!"</p>

  <p>"You have come to seek my help," Peter Ruff said, slowly. "From what you
  say about this man, I presume that he is not to be frightened?"</p>

  <p>"Not for a single moment," Sir Richard answered. "The law has no terrors
  for him. He is as slippery as an eel. He has his story pat. He even has his
  witnesses ready. I can assure you that Mr. Teddy Jones isn't by any means an
  ordinary sort of person."</p>

  <p>"He is not to be bluffed," Peter Ruff said, slowly; "he is not to be
  bribed. What remains?"</p>

  <p>"I have come here," Sir Richard said, "for your advice, Mr. Ruff."</p>

  <p>"The blackmailer," Peter Ruff said, "is a criminal."</p>

  <p>"He is a scoundrel!" Sir Richard assented.</p>

  <p>"He is not fit to live," Peter Ruff repeated.</p>

  <p>"He contaminates the world with every breath he draws!" Sir Richard
  assented.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," Peter Ruff said, "you had better give me his address, and the
  name he goes under."</p>

  <p>"He lives at a boarding-house in Russell Street, Bloomsbury," Sir Richard
  said. "It is Mrs. Bognor's boarding-house. She calls it, I believe, the
  'American Home from Home.' The number is 17."</p>

  <p>"A boarding-house," Peter Ruff repeated, thoughtfully. "Makes it a little
  hard to get at him privately, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Fling him a bait and he will come to you," Sir Richard answered. "He is
  an adventurer pure and simple, though perhaps you wouldn't believe it to look
  at him now. He has grown fat on the money he has wrung from me."</p>

  <p>"You had better leave the matter in my hands for a few days," Peter Ruff
  said. "I will have a talk with this gentleman and see whether he is really so
  unmanageable. If he is, there is, of course, only one way, and for that way,
  Sir Richard, you would have to pay a little high."</p>

  <p>"If I were to hear to-morrow," Sir Richard said quietly, "that Teddy Jones
  was dead, I would give five thousand pounds to the man who brought me the
  information!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"It would be worth that," he said&mdash;"quite! I will drop you a line in
  the course of the next few days."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard took up his hat, lit another of Peter Ruff's cigarettes, and
  departed. They heard the rattle of the lift as it descended. Then Miss Brown
  turned round in her chair.</p>

  <p>"Don't you do it, Peter!" she said solemnly. "The time has gone by for
  that sort of thing. The man may be unfit to live, but you don't need to risk
  as much as that for a matter of five thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"Quite right," he said; "quite right, Violet. At the same time, five
  thousand pounds is an excellent sum. We must see what can be done."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff's method of seeing what could be done was at first the very
  obvious one of seeking to discover any incidents in the past of the person
  known as Teddy Jones likely to reflect present discredit upon him if brought
  to light. From the first, it was quite clear that the career of this
  gentleman had been far from immaculate. His researches proved, beyond a
  doubt, that the gentleman in question had resorted, during the last ten or
  fifteen years, to many and very questionable methods of obtaining a living.
  At the same time, there was nothing which Peter Ruff felt that the man might
  not brazen out. His present mode of life seemed&mdash;on the surface, at any
  rate&mdash;to be beyond reproach. There was only one association which was
  distinctly questionable, and it was in this one direction, therefore, that
  Peter Ruff concentrated himself. The case, for some reason, interested him so
  much that he took a close and personal interest in it, and he was rewarded
  one day by discovering this enemy of Sir Richard's sitting, toward five
  o'clock in the afternoon, in a cafe in Regent Street, engrossed in
  conversation with a person whom Peter Ruff knew to be a very black sheep
  indeed&mdash;a man who had been tried for murder, and concerning whom there
  were still many unpleasant rumors. From behind his paper in a corner of the
  cafe, Peter Ruff watched these two men. Teddy Jones&mdash;or Major Edward
  Jones, as it seemed he was now called&mdash;was a person whose appearance no
  longer suggested the poverty against which he had been struggling most of his
  life. He was well dressed and tolerably well turned out. His face was a
  little puffy, and he had put on flesh during these days of his ease. His
  eyes, too, had a somewhat furtive expression, although his general deportment
  was one of braggadocio. Peter Ruff, quick always in his likes or dislikes,
  found the man repulsive from the start. He felt that he would have a genuine
  pleasure, apart from the matter of the five thousand pounds, in accelerating
  Major Jones's departure from a world which he certainly did not adorn.</p>

  <p>The two men conducted their conversation in a subdued tone, which made it
  quite impossible for Peter Ruff, in his somewhat distant corner, to overhear
  a single word of it. It was obvious, however, that they were not on the best
  of terms. Major Jones's companion was protesting, and apparently without
  success, against some course of action or speech of his companions. The
  conversation, on the other hand, never reached a quarrel, and the two men
  left the place together apparently on ordinary terms of friendliness. Peter
  Ruff at once quitted his seat and crossed the room toward the spot where they
  had been sitting. He dived under the table and picked up a newspaper&mdash;it
  was the only clue left to him as to the nature of their conversation. More
  than once, Major Jones who had, soon after their arrival, sent a waiter for
  it, had pointed to a certain paragraph as though to give weight to his
  statements. Peter Ruff had noticed the exact position of that paragraph. He
  smoothed out the paper and found it at once. It was an account of the murder
  of a wealthy old woman, living on the outskirts of a country village not far
  from London. Peter Ruff's face did not change as he called for another
  vermouth and read the description, slowly. Yet he was aware that he had
  possibly stumbled across the very thing for which he had searched so
  urgently! The particulars of the murder he already knew well, as at one time
  he had felt inclined to aid the police in their so far fruitless
  investigations. He therefore skipped the description of the tragedy, and
  devoted his attention to the last paragraph, toward which he fancied that the
  finger of Major Jones had been chiefly directed. It was a list of the stolen
  property, which consisted of jewelry, gold and notes to a very considerable
  amount. With the waiter's permission, he annexed the paper, cut out the list
  of articles with a sharp penknife, and placed it in his pocketbook before he
  left the cafe.</p>

  <p>In the course of some of the smaller cases with which Peter Ruff had been
  from time to time connected, he had more than once come into contact with the
  authorities at Scotland Yard, and he had several acquaintances
  there&mdash;not including Mr. John Dory&mdash;to whom, at times, he had given
  valuable information. For the first time, he now sought some return for his
  many courtesies. He drove straight from the cafe to the office of the Chief
  of the Criminal Investigation Department. The questions he asked there were
  only two, but they were promptly and courteously answered. Peter Ruff left
  the building and drove back to his rooms in a somewhat congratulatory frame
  of mind. After all, it was chance which was the chief factor in the solution
  of so many of these cases! Often he had won less success after months of
  untiring effort than he had gained during that few minutes in the cafe in
  Regent Street.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff became an inmate of that very select boarding-house carried on
  by Mrs. Bognor at number 17 Russell Street, Bloomsbury. He arrived with a
  steamer trunk, an elaborate traveling-bag and a dressing-case; took the best
  vacant room in the house, and dressed for dinner. Mrs. Bognor looked upon him
  as a valuable addition to her clientele, and introduced him freely to her
  other guests. Among these was Major Edward Jones. Major Jones sat at Mrs.
  Bognor's right hand, and was evidently the show guest of the boarding-house.
  Peter Ruff, without the least desire to attack his position, sat upon her
  left and monopolized the conversation. On the third night it turned, by
  chance, upon precious stones. Peter Ruff drew a little chamois leather bag
  from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, "that my tastes are peculiar. I have been in the
  East, and I have seen very many precious stones in their uncut state. To my
  mind, there is nothing to be compared with opals. These are a few I brought
  home from India. Perhaps you would like to look at them, Mrs. Bognor."</p>

  <p>They were passed round, amidst a little chorus of admiration.</p>

  <p>"The large one with the blue fire," Peter Ruff remarked, "is, I think,
  remarkably beautiful. I have never seen a stone quite like it."</p>

  <p>"It is wonderful!" murmured the young lady who was sitting at Major
  Jones's right hand. "What a fortunate man you are, Mr. Ruff, to have such a
  collection of treasures!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff bowed across the table. Major Jones, who was beginning to feel
  that his position as show guest was in danger, thrust his hand into his
  waistcoat pocket and produced a lady's ring, in which was set a single
  opal.</p>

  <p>"Very pretty stones," he remarked carelessly, "but I can't say I am very
  fond of them. Here's one that belonged to my sister, and my grandmother
  before her. I have it in my pocket because I was thinking of having the stone
  reset and making a present of it to a friend of mine."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff's popularity waned&mdash;he had said nothing about making a
  present to any one of even the most insignificant of his opals! And the one
  which Major Jones now handed round was certainly a magnificent stone. Peter
  Ruff examined it with the rest, and under the pretext of studying the
  setting, gazed steadfastly at the inside through his eyeglass. Major Jones,
  from the other side of the table, frowned, and held out his hand for the
  ring.</p>

  <p>"A very beautiful stone indeed!" Peter Ruff declared, passing it across
  the tablecloth. "Really, I do not think that there is one in my little
  collection to be compared with it. Have you many treasures like this, Major
  Jones?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, a few!" the Major answered carelessly, "family heirlooms, most of
  them."</p>

  <p>"You will have to give me the ring, Major Jones," the young lady on his
  right remarked archly. "It's bad luck, you know, to give it to any one who is
  not born in October, and my birthday is on the twelfth."</p>

  <p>"My dear Miss Levey," Major Jones answered, whispering in her ear, "more
  unlikely things have happened than that I should beg your acceptance of this
  little trifle."</p>

  <p>"Sooner or later," Peter Ruff said genially, "I should like to have a
  little conversation with you, Major. I fancy that we ought to be able to find
  plenty of subjects of common interest."</p>

  <p>"Delighted, I'm sure!" the latter answered, utterly unsuspicious. "Shall
  we go into the smoking-room now, or would you rather play a rubber
  first?"</p>

  <p>"If it is all the same to you," Peter Ruff said, "I think we will have a
  cigar first. There will be plenty of time for bridge afterwards."</p>

  <p>"May I offer you a cigar, sir?" Major Jones inquired, passing across a
  well-filled case.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff sighed.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, Major," he said, "that there is scarcely time. You see, I
  have a warrant in my pocket for your arrest, and I am afraid that by the time
  we got to the station&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Major Jones leaned forward in his chair. He gripped the sides tightly with
  both hands. His eyes seemed to be protruding from his head.</p>

  <p>"For my what?" he exclaimed, in a tone of horror.</p>

  <p>"For your arrest," Peter Ruff explained calmly. "Surely you must have been
  expecting it! During all these years you must have grown used to expecting it
  at every moment!"</p>

  <p>Major Jones collapsed. He looked at Ruff as one might look at a man who
  has taken leave of his senses. Yet underneath it all was the coward's
  fear!</p>

  <p>"What are you talking about, man?" he exclaimed. "What do you mean? Lower
  your voice, for heaven's sake! Consider my position here! Some one might
  overhear! If this is a joke, let me tell you that it's a d&mdash;&mdash;d
  foolish one!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"I do not wish," he said, "to create a disturbance&mdash;my manner of
  coming here should have assured you of that. At the same time, business is
  business. I hold a warrant for your arrest, and I am forced to execute
  it."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that you are a detective, then?" Major Jones demanded.</p>

  <p>He was a big man, but his voice seemed to have grown very small
  indeed.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," Peter Ruff answered. "I should not come here without
  authority."</p>

  <p>"What is the charge?" the other man faltered.</p>

  <p>"Blackmail," Peter Ruff said slowly. "The information against you is
  lodged by Sir Richard Dyson."</p>

  <p>It seemed to Peter Ruff, who was watching his companion closely, that a
  wave of relief passed over the face of the man who sat cowering in his chair.
  He certainly drew a little gasp&mdash;stretched out his hands, as though to
  thrust the shadow of some fear from him. His voice, when he spoke, was
  stronger. Some faint show of courage was returning to him.</p>

  <p>"There is some ridiculous mistake," he declared. "Let us talk this over
  like sensible men, Mr. Ruff. If you will wait until I have spoken to Sir
  Richard, I can promise you that the warrant shall be withdrawn, and that you
  shall not be the loser."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid it is too late for anything of that sort," Peter Ruff said.
  "Sir Richard's patience has been completely exhausted by your repeated
  demands."</p>

  <p>"He never told me so," Major Jones whined. "I quite thought that he was
  always glad to help an old friend. As a matter of fact, I had not meant to
  ask him for anything else. The last few hundreds I had from him was to have
  closed the thing up. It was the end."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "it was not the end! It never would have been the end! Sir
  Richard sought my advice, and I gave it him without hesitation. Sooner or
  later, I told him, he would have to adopt different measures. I convinced
  him. I represent those measures!"</p>

  <p>"But the matter can be arranged," Major Jones insisted, with a little
  shudder, "I am perfectly certain it can be arranged. Mr. Ruff, you are not an
  ordinary police officer&mdash;I am sure of that. Give me a chance of having
  an interview with Sir Richard before anything more is done. I will satisfy
  him, I promise you that. Why, if we leave the place together like this, every
  one here will get to know about it!"</p>

  <p>"Be reasonable," Peter Ruff answered. "Of course everyone will get to know
  about it! Blackmailing cases always excite a considerable amount of interest.
  Your photograph will probably be in the Daily Mirror tomorrow or the next
  day. In the meantime, I must trouble you to pay your respects to Mrs. Bognor
  and to come with me."</p>

  <p>"To Sir Richard's house?" Major Jones asked, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"To the police-stations," Peter Ruff answered.</p>

  <p>Major Jones did not rise. He sat for a few moments with his head buried in
  his hands.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ruff," he said hoarsely, "listen to me. I have been fortunate lately
  in some investments. I am not so poor as I was. I have my check-book in my
  pocket, and a larger balance in the bank now than I have ever had before. If
  I write you a check for, say, a hundred&mdash;no, two!&mdash;five!" he cried,
  desperately, watching Peter Ruff's unchanging face&mdash;"five hundred
  pounds, will you come round with me to Sir Richard's house in a hansom at
  once?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Five thousand pounds would not buy your liberty from me, Major Jones," he
  said.</p>

  <p>The man became abject.</p>

  <p>"Have pity, then," he pleaded. "My health is not good&mdash;I couldn't
  stand imprisonment. Think of what it means to a man of my age suddenly to
  leave everything worth having in life just because he may have imposed a
  little on the generosity of a friend! Think how you would feel, and be
  merciful!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head slowly. His face was immovable, but there was a
  look in his eyes from which the other man shrank.</p>

  <p>"Major Jones," he said, "you ask me be merciful. You appeal to my pity.
  For such as you I have no pity, nor have I ever shown any mercy. You know
  very well, and I know, that when once the hand of the law touches your
  shoulder, it will not be only a charge o' blackmail which the police will
  bring against you!"</p>

  <p>"There is nothing else&mdash;nothing else!" he cried. "Take half my
  fortune, Mr. Ruff. Let me get away. Give me a chance&mdash;just a sporting
  chance!"</p>

  <p>"I wonder," Peter Ruff said, "what chance that poor old lady in Weston
  had? No, I am not saying you murdered her. You never had the pluck. Your
  confederate did that, and you handled the booty. What were the initials
  inside that ring you showed us to-night, Major Jones?"</p>

  <p>"Let me go to my bedroom," he said, in a strange, far-away tone. "You can
  come with me and stand outside."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff assented.</p>

  <p>"To save scandal," he said, "yes!"</p>

  <p>Three flights of stairs they climbed. When at last they reached the door,
  the trembling man made one last appeal.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ruff," he said, "have a little mercy. Give me an hour's
  start&mdash;just a chance for my life!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff pushed him in the door.</p>

  <p>"I am not a hard man," he said, "but I keep my mercy for men!"</p>

  <p>He took the key from the inside of the door, locked it, and with the key
  in his pocket descended to the drawing-room. The young lady who had sat on
  Major Jones's right was singing a ballad. Suddenly she paused in the middle
  of her song. The four people who were playing bridge looked up. Mrs. Bognor
  screamed.</p>

  <p>"What was that?" she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"It sounded," Peter Ruff said, "very much like revolver shot."</p>

  <p>"I see," Sir Richard remarked, with a queer look in his eyes, as he handed
  over a roll of notes to Peter Ruff, "the jury brought it in 'Suicide'! What I
  can't understand is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't try," Peter Ruff interrupted briskly. "It isn't in the bond that
  you should understand."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard helped himself to a drink. A great burden had passed from his
  shoulders, but he was not feeling at his best that morning. He could scarcely
  keep his eyes from Peter Ruff.</p>

  <p>"Ruff," he said, "I have known you some time, and I have known you to be a
  square man. I have known you to do good-natured actions. I came to you in
  desperation but I scarcely expected this!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff emptied his own tumbler and took up his hat.</p>

  <p>"Sir Richard," he said, "you are like a good many other people. Now that
  the thing is done, you shrink from the thought of it. You even wonder how I
  could have planned to bring about the death of this man. Listen, Sir Richard.
  Pity for the deserving, or for those who have in them one single quality, one
  single grain, of good, is a sentiment which deserves respect. Pity for
  vermin, who crawl about the world leaving a poisonous trail upon everything
  they touch, is a false and unnatural sentiment. For every hopelessly corrupt
  man who is induced to quit this life there is a more deserving one, somewhere
  or other, for whom the world is a better place."</p>

  <p>"So that, after all, you are a philanthropist, Mr. Ruff," Sir Richard
  said, with a forced smile.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"A philosopher," he answered, buttoning up his notes.</p>

  <h2>IX. THE PERFIDY OF MISS BROWN<br>
  <small>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), May
  1910</small></h2>

  <p class="first">Peter Ruff came down to his office with a single letter in
  his hand, bearing a French postmark. He returned his secretary's morning
  greeting a little absently, and seated himself at his desk.</p>

  <p>"Violet," he asked, "have you ever been to Paris?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him compassionately.</p>

  <p>"More times than you, I think, Peter," she answered.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"That," he exclaimed, "is very possible! Could you get ready to leave by
  the two-twenty this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"What, alone?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;with me," he answered.</p>

  <p>She shut down her desk with a bang.</p>

  <p>"Of course I can!" she exclaimed. "What a spree!"</p>

  <p>Then she caught sight of a certain expression on Peter Ruff's face, and
  she looked at him wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"Is anything wrong, Peter?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered, "I cannot say that anything is wrong. I have had an
  invitation to present myself before a certain society in Paris of which you
  have some indirect knowledge. What the summons means I cannot say."</p>

  <p>"Yet you go?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I go," he answered. "I have no choice. If I waited here twenty-four
  hours, I should hear of it."</p>

  <p>"They can have nothing against you," she said. "On the contrary, the only
  time they have appealed for your aid, you gave it&mdash;very valuable aid it
  must have been, too."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"I cannot see," he admitted, "what they can have against me. And yet,
  somehow, the wording of my invitation seemed to me a little ominous.
  Perhaps," he added, walking to the window and standing looking out for a
  moment, "I have a liver this morning. I am depressed. Violet, what does it
  mean when you are depressed?"</p>

  <p>"Shall you wear your gray clothes for traveling?" she asked, a little
  irrelevantly.</p>

  <p>"I have not made up my mind," Peter Ruff answered. "I thought of wearing
  my brown, with a brown overcoat. What do you suggest?"</p>

  <p>"I like you in brown," she answered, simply. "I should change, if I were
  you."</p>

  <p>He smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"I believe," he said, "that you have a sort of superstition that as I
  change my clothes I change my humors."</p>

  <p>"Should I be so very far wrong?" she asked. "Don't think that I am
  laughing at you, Peter. The greatest men in the world have had their
  foibles."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff frowned.</p>

  <p>"We shall be away for several days," he said. "Be sure that you take some
  wraps. It will be cold, crossing."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to close the office altogether?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"Put up a notice," he said&mdash;"'Back on Friday.' Pack up your books and
  take them round to the Bank before you leave. The lift man will call you a
  taxi-cab."</p>

  <p>He watched her preparations with a sort of gloomy calm.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd tell me what is the matter with you?" she asked, as she
  turned to follow her belongings.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," Peter Ruff said. "I, suppose I am suffering from what you
  would call presentiments. Be at Charing-Cross punctually."</p>

  <p>"Why do you go at all?" she asked. "These people are of no further use to
  you. Only the other day, you were saying that you should not accept any more
  outside cases."</p>

  <p>"I must go," Peter Ruff answered. "I am not afraid of many things, but I
  should be afraid of disobeying this letter."</p>

  <p>They had a comfortable journey down, a cool, bright crossing, and found
  their places duly reserved for them in the French train. Miss Brown, in her
  neat traveling clothes and furs, was conscious of looking her best, and she
  did all that was possible to entertain her traveling companion. But Peter
  Ruff seemed like a man who labors under some sense of apprehension. He had
  faced death more than once during the last few years&mdash;faced it without
  flinching, and with a certain cool disregard which can only come from the
  highest sort of courage. Yet he knew, when he read over again in the train
  that brief summons which he was on his way to obey, that he had passed under
  the shadow of some new and indefinable fear. He was perfectly well aware,
  too, that both on the steamer and on the French train he was carefully
  shadowed. This fact, however, did not surprise him. He even went out of his
  way to enter into conversation with one of the two men whose furtive glances
  into their compartment and whose constant proximity had first attracted his
  attention. The man was civil but vague. Nevertheless, when they took their
  places in the dining-car, they found the two men at the next table. Peter
  Ruff pointed them out to his companion.</p>

  <p>"'Double-Fours'!" he whispered. "Don't you feel like a criminal?"</p>

  <p>She laughed, and they took no more notice of the men. But as the train
  drew near Paris, he felt some return of the depression which had troubled him
  during the earlier part of the day. He felt a sense of comfort in his
  companion's presence which was a thing utterly strange to him. On the other
  hand, he was conscious of a certain regret that he had brought her with him
  into an adventure of which he could not foresee the end.</p>

  <p>The lights of Paris flashed around them&mdash;the train was gradually
  slackening speed. Peter Ruff, with a sigh, began to collect their
  belongings.</p>

  <p>"Violet," he said, "I ought not to have brought you." Something in his
  voice puzzled her. There had been every few times, during all the years she
  had known him, when she had been able to detect anything approaching
  sentiment in his tone&mdash;and those few times had been when he had spoken
  of another woman.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she asked, eagerly.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff looked out into the blackness, through the glittering arc of
  lights, and perhaps for once he suffered his fancy to build for him visions
  of things that were not of earth. If so, however, it was a moment which
  swiftly passed. His reply was in a tone as matter of fact as his usual
  speech.</p>

  <p>"Because," he said, "I do not exactly see the end of my present
  expedition&mdash;I do not understand its object."</p>

  <p>"You have some apprehension?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"None at all," he answered. "Why should I? There is an unwritten bargain,"
  he added, a little more slowly, "to which I subscribed with our friends here,
  and I have certainly kept it. In fact, the balance is on my side. There is
  nothing for me to fear."</p>

  <p>The train crept into the Gare du Nord, and they passed through the usual
  routine of the Customs House. Then, in an omnibus, they rumbled slowly over
  the cobblestones, through the region of barely lit streets and untidy cafes,
  down the Rue Lafayette, across the famous Square and into the Rue de
  Rivoli.</p>

  <p>"Our movements," Peter Ruff remarked dryly, "are too well known for us to
  attempt to conceal them. We may as well stop at one of the large hotels. It
  will be more cheerful for you while I am away."</p>

  <p>They engaged rooms at the Continental. Miss Brown, whose apartments were
  in the wing of the hotel overlooking the gardens, ascended at once to her
  room. Peter Ruff, who had chosen a small suite on the other side, went into
  the bar for a whiskey and soda. A man touched him on the elbow.</p>

  <p>"For Monsieur," he murmured, and vanished.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff turned and opened the note. It bore a faint perfume, it had a
  coronet upon the flap of the envelope, and it was written in a delicate
  feminine handwriting.</p>

  <p class="letter">DEAR Mr. RUFF:&mdash; If you are not too tired with your
  journey, will you call soon after one o'clock to meet some old
  friends?&mdash; BLANCHE DE MAUPASSIM.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff drank his whiskey and soda, went up to his rooms, and made a
  careful toilet. Then he sent a page up for Violet, who came down within a few
  minutes. She was dressed with apparent simplicity in a high-necked gown, a
  large hat, and a single rope of pearls. In place of the usual gold purse, she
  carried a small white satin bag, exquisitely hand-painted. Everything about
  her bespoke that elegant restraint so much a feature of the Parisian woman of
  fashion herself. Peter Ruff, who had told her to prepare for supping out, was
  at first struck by the simplicity of her attire. Afterwards, he came to
  appreciate its perfection.</p>

  <p>They went to the Cafe de Paris, where they were the first arrivals.
  People, however, began to stream in before they had finished their meal, and
  Peter Ruff, comparing his companion's appearance with the more flamboyant
  charms of these ladies from the Opera and the theatres, began to understand
  the numerous glances of admiration which the impressionable Frenchmen so
  often turned in their direction. There was between them, toward the end of
  the meal, something which amounted almost to nervousness.</p>

  <p>"You are going to keep your appointment to-night, Peter?" his companion
  asked.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"As soon as I have taken you home," he said. "I shall probably return
  late, so we will breakfast here to-morrow morning, if you like, at half-past
  twelve. I will send a note to your room when I am ready."</p>

  <p>She looked him in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"Peter," she said, "supposing that note doesn't come!"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"My dear Violet," he said, "you and I&mdash;or rather I, for you are not
  concerned in this&mdash;live a life which is a little different from the
  lives of most of the people around us. The million pay their taxes, and they
  expect police protection in times of danger. For me there is no such
  resource. My life has its own splendid compensations. I have weapons with
  which to fight any ordinary danger. What I want to explain to you is
  this&mdash;that if you hear no more of me, you can do nothing. If that note
  does not come to you in the morning, you can do nothing. Wait here for three
  days, and after that go back to England. You will find a letter on your desk,
  telling you there exactly what to do."</p>

  <p>"You have something in your mind," she said, "of which you have not told
  me."</p>

  <p>"I have nothing," he answered, firmly. "Upon my honor, I know of no
  possible cause of offense which our friends could have against me. Their
  summons is, I will admit, somewhat extraordinary, but I go to obey it
  absolutely without fear. You can sleep well, Violet. We lunch here to-morrow,
  without a doubt."</p>

  <p>They drove back to the hotel almost in silence. Violet was looking fixedly
  out of the window of the taxicab, as though interested in watching the crowds
  upon the street. Peter Ruff appeared to be absorbed in his own thoughts. Yet
  perhaps they were both of them nearer to one another than either surmised.
  Their parting in the hall of the Continental Hotel was unemotional enough.
  For a moment Peter Ruff had hesitated while her hand had lain in his. He had
  opened his lips as though he had something to say. Her eyes grew suddenly
  softer&mdash;seemed to seek his as though begging for those unspoken words.
  But Peter Ruff did not say them then.</p>

  <p>"I shall be back all right," he said. "Good night, Violet! Sleep
  well!"</p>

  <p>He turned back towards the waiting taxicab.</p>

  <p>"Number 16, Rue de St. Quintaine," he told the man. It was not a long
  ride. In less than a quarter of an hour, Peter Ruff presented himself before
  a handsome white house in a quiet, aristocratic-looking street. At his
  summons, the postern door flew open, and a man-servant in plain livery stood
  at the second entrance.</p>

  <p>"Madame la Marquise?" Peter Ruff asked.</p>

  <p>The man bowed in silence, and took the visitor's hat and overcoat. He
  passed along a spacious hall and into a delightfully furnished reception
  room, where an old lady with gray hair sat in the midst of a little circle of
  men. Peter Ruff stood, for a moment, upon the threshold, looking around him.
  She held out her hands.</p>

  <p>"It is Monsieur Peter Ruff, is it not? At last, then, I am gratified. I
  have wished for so long to see one who has become so famous."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff took her hands in his and raised them gallantly to his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Madame," he said, "this is a pleasure indeed. At my last visit here, you
  were in Italy."</p>

  <p>"I grow old," she answered. "I leave Paris but little now. Where one has
  lived, one should at least be content to die."</p>

  <p>"Madame speaks a philosophy," Peter Ruff answered, "which as yet she has
  no need to learn."</p>

  <p>The old lady turned to a man who stood upon her right:</p>

  <p>"And this from an Englishman!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>There were others who took Peter Ruff by the hand then. The servants were
  handing round coffee in little Sevres cups. On the sideboard was a choice of
  liqueurs and bottles of wine. Peter Ruff found himself hospitably entertained
  with both small talk and refreshments. But every now and then his eyes
  wandered back to where Madame sat in her chair, her hair as white as
  snow&mdash;beautiful still, in spite of the cruel mouth and the narrow
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"She is wonderful!" he murmured to a man who stood by his side.</p>

  <p>"She is eighty-six," was the answer in a whisper, "and she knows
  everything."</p>

  <p>As the clock struck two, a tall footman entered the room and wheeled
  Madame's chair away. Several of the guests left at the same time. Ruff, when
  the door was closed, counted those who remained. As he had imagined would be
  the case, he found that there were eight.</p>

  <p>A tall, gray-bearded man, who from the first had attached himself to Ruff,
  and who seemed to act as a sort of master of ceremonies, now approached him
  once more and laid his hand upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Mon ami," he said, "we will now discuss, if it pleases you, the little
  matter concerning which we took the liberty of asking you to favor us with a
  visit."</p>

  <p>"What, here?" Peter Ruff asked, in some surprise.</p>

  <p>His friend, who had introduced himself as Monsieur de Founcelles,
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"But why not?" he asked. "Ah, but I think I understand!" he added, almost
  immediately. "You are English, Monsieur Peter Ruff, and in some respects you
  have not moved with the times. Confess, now, that your idea of a secret
  society is a collection of strangely attired men who meet in a cellar, and
  build subterranean passages in case of surprise. In Paris, I think, we have
  gone beyond that sort of thing. We of the 'Double-Four' have no headquarters
  save the drawing-room of Madame; no hiding-places whatsoever; no
  meeting-places save the fashionable cafes or our own reception rooms. The
  police follow us&mdash;what can they discover?&mdash;nothing! What is there
  to discover?&mdash;nothing! Our lives are lived before the eyes of all Paris.
  There is never any suspicion of mystery about any of our movements. We have
  our hobbies, and we indulge in them. Monsieur the Marquis de Sogrange here is
  a great sportsman. Monsieur le Comte owns many racehorses. I myself am an
  authority on pictures, and own a collection which I have bequeathed to the
  State. Paris knows us well as men of fashion and mark&mdash;Paris does not
  guess that we have perfected an organization so wonderful that the whole
  criminal world pays toll to us."</p>

  <p>"Dear me," Peter Ruff said, "this is very interesting!"</p>

  <p>"We have a trained army at our disposal," Monsieur de Founcelles
  continued, "who numerically, as well as in intelligence, outnumber the whole
  force of gendarmes in Paris. No criminal from any other country can settle
  down here and hope for success, unless he joins us. An exploit which is
  inspired by us cannot fail. Our agents may count on our protection, and
  receive it without question."</p>

  <p>"I am bewildered," Peter Ruff said, frankly. "I do not understand how you
  gentlemen&mdash;whom one knows by name so well as patrons of sport and
  society, can spare the time for affairs of such importance."</p>

  <p>Monsieur de Founcelles nodded.</p>

  <p>"We have very valuable aid," he said. "There is below us&mdash;the
  'Double-Four'&mdash;the eight gentlemen now present, an executive council
  composed of five of the shrewdest men in France. They take their orders from
  us. We plan, and they obey. We have imagination, and special sources of
  knowledge. They have the most perfect machinery for carrying out our schemes
  that it is possible to imagine. I do not wish to boast, Mr. Ruff, but if I
  take a directory of Paris and place after any man's name, whatever his
  standing or estate, a black cross, that man dies before seven days have
  passed. You buy your evening paper&mdash;a man has committed suicide! You
  read of a letter found by his side: an unfortunate love affair&mdash;a tale
  of jealousy or reckless speculation. Mr. Ruff, the majority of these
  explanations are false. They are invented and arranged for by us. This year
  alone, five men in Paris, of position, have been found dead, and accounted,
  for excellent reasons, suicides. In each one of these cases, Monsieur Ruff,
  although not a soul has a suspicion of it, the removal of these men was
  arranged for by the' Double-Four.'"</p>

  <p>"I trust," Peter Ruff said, "that it may never be my ill-fortune to incur
  the displeasure of so marvelous an association."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, Monsieur Ruff," the other answered, "the attention of
  the association has been directed towards certain incidents of your career in
  a most favorable manner. We have spoken of you often lately, Mr. Ruff,
  between ourselves. We arrive now at the object for which we begged the honor
  of your visit. It is to offer you the Presidency of our Executive
  Council."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff had thought of many things, but he had not thought of this! He
  gasped, recovered himself, and realized at once the dangers of the position
  in which he stood.</p>

  <p>"The Council of Five!" he said thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Monsieur de Founcelles replied. "The salary&mdash;forgive me
  for giving such prominence to a matter which you doubtless consider of
  secondary importance&mdash;is ten thousand pounds a year, with a residence
  here and in London&mdash;also servants."</p>

  <p>"It is princely!" Peter Ruff declared. "I cannot imagine, Monsieur, how
  you could have believed me capable of filling such a position."</p>

  <p>"There is not much about you, Mr. Ruff, which we do not know," Monsieur de
  Founcelles answered. "There are points about your career which we have marked
  with admiration. Your work over here was rapid and comprehensive. We know all
  about your checkmating the Count von Hern and the Comtesse de Pilitz. We have
  appealed to you for aid once only&mdash;your response was prompt and
  brilliant. You have all the qualifications we desire. You are still young,
  physically you are sound, you speak all languages, and you are
  unmarried."</p>

  <p>"I am what?" Peter Ruff asked, with a start.</p>

  <p>"A bachelor," Monsieur de Founcelles answered. "We who have made crime and
  its detection a life-long study, have reduced many matters concerning it to
  almost mathematical exactitude. Of one thing we have become absolutely
  convinced&mdash;it is that the great majority of cases in which the police
  triumph are due to the treachery of women. The criminal who steers clear of
  the other sex escapes a greater danger than the detectives who dog his heels.
  It is for that reason that we choose only unmarried men for our executive
  council."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff made a gesture of despair. "And I am to be married in a month!"
  he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>There was a murmur of dismay. If those other seven men had not once
  intervened, it was because the conduct of the affair had been voted into the
  hands of Monsieur de Founcelles, and there was little which he had left
  unsaid. Nevertheless, they had formed a little circle around the two men.
  Every word passing between them had been listened to eagerly. Gestures and
  murmured exclamations had been frequent enough. There arose now a chorus of
  voices which their leader had some difficulty in silencing.</p>

  <p>"It must be arranged!"</p>

  <p>"But it is impossible&mdash;this!"</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Ruff amuses himself with us!"</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," Peter Ruff said, "I can assure you that I do nothing of the
  sort. The affair was arranged some months ago, and the young lady is even now
  in Paris, purchasing her trousseau."</p>

  <p>Monsieur de Founcelles, with a wave of the hand, commanded silence. There
  was probably a way out. In any case, one must be found.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Ruff," he said, "putting aside, for one moment, your sense of
  honor, which of course forbids you even to consider the possibility of
  breaking your word&mdash;supposing that the young lady herself should
  withdraw&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You don't know Miss Brown!" Peter Ruff interrupted. "It is a pleasure to
  which I hope to attain," Monsieur de Founcelles declared, smoothly. "Let us
  consider once more my proposition. I take it for granted that, apart from
  this threatened complication, you find it agreeable?"</p>

  <p>"I am deeply honored by it," Peter Ruff declared.</p>

  <p>"Well, that being so," Monsieur de Founcelles said, more cheerfully, "we
  must see whether we cannot help you. Tell me, who is this fortunate young
  lady&mdash;this Miss Brown?"</p>

  <p>"She is a young person of good birth and some means," Peter Ruff declared.
  "She is, in a small way, an actress; she has also been my secretary from the
  first." Monsieur de Founcelles nodded his head thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he said. "She knows your secrets, then, I presume?"</p>

  <p>"She does," Peter Ruff assented. "She knows a great deal!"</p>

  <p>"A young person to be conciliated by all means," Monsieur de Founcelles
  declared. "Well, we must see. When, Monsieur Ruff, may I have the opportunity
  of making the acquaintance of this young lady?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow morning, or rather this morning, if you will," Peter Ruff
  answered. "We are taking breakfast together at the cafe de Paris. It will
  give me great pleasure if you will join us."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," Monsieur de Founcelles declared, "I must beg of you
  slightly to alter your plans. I will ask you and Mademoiselle to do me the
  honor of breakfasting at the Ritz with the Marquis de Sogrange and myself, at
  the same hour. We shall find there more opportunity for a short
  discussion."</p>

  <p>"I am entirely at your service," Peter Ruff answered. There were signs now
  of a breaking-up of the little party.</p>

  <p>"We must all regret, dear Monsieur Ruff," Monsieur de Founcelles said, as
  he made his adieux, "this temporary obstruction to the consummation of our
  hopes. Let us pray that Mademoiselle will not be unreasonable."</p>

  <p>"You are very kind," Peter Ruff murmured.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff drove through the gray dawn to his hotel, in the splendid
  automobile of Monsieur de Founcelles, whose homeward route lay in that
  direction. It was four o'clock when he accepted his key from a sleepy-looking
  clerk, and turned towards the staircase. The hotel was wrapped in semi-gloom.
  Sweepers and cleaners were at work. The palms had been turned out into the
  courtyard. Dust sheets lay over the furniture. One person only, save himself
  and the untidy-looking servants, was astir. From a distant corner which
  commanded the entrance, he saw Violet stealing away to the corridor which led
  to her part of the hotel. She had sat there all through the night to see him
  come in&mdash;to be assured of his safety! Peter Ruff stared after her
  disappearing figure as one might have watched a ghost.</p>

  <p>The luncheon-party was a great success. Peter Ruff was human enough to be
  proud of his companion&mdash;proud of her smartness, which was indubitable
  even here, surrounded as they were by Frenchwomen of the best class; proud of
  her accent, of the admiration which she obviously excited in the two
  Frenchmen. His earlier enjoyment of the meal was a little clouded from the
  fact that he felt himself utterly outshone in the matter of general
  appearance. No tailor had ever suggested to him a coat so daring and yet so
  perfect as that which adorned the person of the Marquis de Sogrange. The deep
  violet of his tie was a shade unknown in Bond Street&mdash;inimitable&mdash;a
  true education in color. They had the bearing, too, these Frenchmen! He
  watched Monsieur de Founcelles bending over Violet, and he was suddenly
  conscious of a wholly new sensation. He did not recognize&mdash;could not
  even classify it. He only knew that it was not altogether pleasant, and that
  it set the warm blood tingling through his veins.</p>

  <p>It was not until they were sitting out in the winter garden, taking their
  coffee and liqueurs, that the object of their meeting was referred to. Then
  Monsieur de Founcelles drew Violet a little away from the others, and the
  Marquis, with a meaning smile, took Peter Ruff's arm and led him on one side.
  Monsieur de Founcelles wasted no words at all.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle," he said, "Monsieur Ruff has doubtless told you that last
  night I made him the offer of a great position among us."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with twinkling eyes.</p>

  <p>"Go on, please," she said.</p>

  <p>"I offered him a position of great dignity&mdash;of great responsibility,"
  Monsieur de Founcelles continued. "I cannot explain to you its exact nature,
  but it is in connection with the most wonderful organization of its sort
  which the world has ever known."</p>

  <p>"The 'Double-Four,'" she murmured.</p>

  </div>

  <p>"Attached to the post is a princely salary and but one condition,"
  Monsieur de Founcelles said, watching the girl's face. "The condition is that
  Mr. Ruff remains a bachelor."</p>

  <p>Violet nodded.</p>

  <p>"Peter's told me all this," she remarked. "He wants me to give him
  up."</p>

  <p>Monsieur de Founcelles drew a little closer to his companion. There was a
  peculiar smile upon his lips.</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady," he said softly, "forgive me if I point out to you
  that with your appearance and gifts a marriage with our excellent friend is
  surely not the summit of your ambitions! Here in Paris, I promise you,
  here&mdash;we can do much better than that for you. You have not, perhaps, a
  dot? Good! That is our affair. Give up our friend here, and we deposit in any
  bank you like to name the sum of two hundred and fifty thousand francs."</p>

  <p>"Two hundred and fifty thousand francs!" Violet repeated, slowly.</p>

  <p>Monsieur de Founcelles nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is enough?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It is not enough," she answered.</p>

  <p>Monsieur de Founcelles raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"We do not bargain," he said coldly, "and money is not the chief thing in
  the world. It is for you, then, to name a sum."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur de Founcelles," she said, "can you tell me the amount of the
  national debt of France?"</p>

  <p>"Somewhere about nine hundred million francs, I believe," he answered.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is exactly my price," she declared.</p>

  <p>"For giving up Peter Ruff?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>She looked at her employer thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't look worth it, does he?" she said, with a queer little smile.
  "I happen to care for him, though&mdash;that's all."</p>

  <p>Monsieur de Founcelles shrugged his shoulders. He knew men and women, and
  for the present he accepted defeat. He sighed heavily.</p>

  <p>"I congratulate our friend, and I envy him," he said. "If ever you should
  change your mind, Mademoiselle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is our privilege, isn't it?" she remarked, with a brilliant smile. "If
  I do, I shall certainly let you know."</p>

  <p>On the way home, Peter Ruff was genial&mdash;Miss Brown silent. He had
  escaped from a difficult position, and his sense of gratitude toward his
  companion was strong. He showed her many little attentions on the voyage
  which sometimes escaped him. From Dover, they had a carriage to
  themselves.</p>

  <p>"Peter," Miss Brown said, after he had made her comfortable, "when is it
  to be?"</p>

  <p>"When is what to be?" he asked, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Our marriage," she answered, looking at him for a moment in most
  bewildering fashion and then suddenly dropping her eyes.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff returned her gaze in blank amazement.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, Violet?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Just what I say," she answered, composedly. "When are we going to be
  married?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff frowned.</p>

  <p>"What nonsense!" he said. "We are not going to be married. You know that
  quite well."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, I don't!" she declared, smiling at him in a heavenly fashion. "At
  your request I have told Monsieur de Founcelles that we were engaged.
  Incidentally, I have refused two hundred and fifty thousand francs and, I
  believe, an admirer, for your sake. I declared that I was going to marry you,
  and I must keep my word."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff began to feel giddy.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Violet," he said, "you know very well that we arranged all
  that between ourselves."</p>

  <p>"Arranged all that?" she repeated, with a little laugh. "Perhaps we did.
  You asked me to marry you, and you posed as my fiancee. You kept it up just
  as long as you&mdash;it suits me to keep it up a little longer."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say&mdash;do you seriously mean that you expect me to
  marry you?" he asked, aghast.</p>

  <p>"I do," she admitted. "I have meant you to for some time, Peter!"</p>

  <p>She was very alluring, and Peter Ruff hesitated. She held out her hands
  and leaned towards him. Her muff fell to the floor. She had raised her veil,
  and a faint perfume of violets stole into the carriage. Her lips were a
  little parted, her eyes were saying unutterable things.</p>

  <p>"You don't want me to sue you, do you, Peter?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff sighed&mdash;and yielded.</p>

  <h2>X. WONDERFUL JOHN DORY<br>
  <small>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Jun
  1910</small></h2>

  <p class="first">The woman who had been Peter Ruff's first love had fallen
  upon evil days. Her prettiness was on the wane&mdash;powder and rouge, late
  hours, and excesses of many kinds, had played havoc with it, even in these
  few months. Her clothes were showy but cheap. Her boots themselves, unclean
  and down at heel, told the story. She stood upon the threshold of Peter
  Ruff's office, and looked half defiantly, half doubtfully at Violet, who was
  its sole occupant.</p>

  <p>"Can I do anything for you?" the latter asked, noticing the woman's
  hesitation.</p>

  <p>"I want to see Mr. Ruff," the visitor said.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ruff is out at present," Violet answered.</p>

  <p>"When will he be in?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you," Violet said. "Perhaps you had better leave a message.
  Or will you call again? Mr. Ruff is very uncertain in his movements."</p>

  <p>Maud sank into a chair.</p>

  <p>"I'll wait," she declared.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," Violet remarked, raising her eyebrows, "whether that will
  be convenient. There may be other clients in. Mr. Ruff himself may not be
  back for several hours."</p>

  <p>"Are you his secretary?" Maud asked, without moving.</p>

  <p>"I am his secretary and also his wife," Violet declared. The woman raised
  herself a little in her chair.</p>

  <p>"Some people have all the luck," she muttered. "It's only a few months ago
  that Mr. Ruff was glad enough to take me out. You remember when I used to
  come here?"</p>

  <p>"I remember," Violet assented.</p>

  <p>"I was all right then," the woman continued, "and now&mdash;now I'm down
  and out," she added, with a little sob. "You see what I am like. You look as
  though you didn't care to have me in the office, and I don't wonder at it.
  You look as though you were afraid I'd come to beg, and you are right&mdash;I
  have come to beg."</p>

  <p>"I am sure Mr. Ruff will do what he can for you," Violet said,
  "although&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I see you know all about it," Maud interrupted, with a hard little laugh.
  "I came once to wheedle information out of him. I came to try and betray the
  only man who ever really cared for me. Mr. Ruff was too clever, and I am
  thankful for it. I have been as big a fool as a woman can be, but I am
  paying&mdash;oh, I am paying for it right enough!"</p>

  <p>She swayed in her chair, and Violet was only just in time to catch her.
  She led the fainting woman to an inner room, made her comfortable upon a
  sofa, and sent out for some food and a bottle of wine. Down in the street
  below, John Dory, who had tracked his wife to the building, was walking away
  with face as black as night. He knew that Maud had lost her position, that
  she was in need of money&mdash;almost penniless. He had waited to see to whom
  she would turn, hoping&mdash;poor fool as he called himself&mdash;that she
  would come back to him. And it was his enemy to whom she had gone! He had
  seen her enter the building; he knew that she had not left it. In the morning
  they brought him another report&mdash;she was still within. It was the end,
  this, he told himself! There must be a settlement between him and Peter
  Ruff!</p>

  <p>Mr. John Dory, who had arrived at Clenarvon Court in a four-wheel cab from
  the nearest railway station, was ushered by the butler to the door of one of
  the rooms on the ground floor, overlooking the Park. A policeman was there on
  guard&mdash;a policeman by his attitude and salute, although he was in plain
  clothes. John Dory nodded, and turned to the butler.</p>

  <p>"You see, the man knows me," he said. "Here is my card. I am John Dory
  from Scotland Yard. I want to have a few words with the sergeant."</p>

  <p>The butler hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Our orders are very strict, sir," he said. "I am afraid that I cannot
  allow you to enter the room without a special permit from his lordship. You
  see, we have had no advice of your coming."</p>

  <p>John Dory nodded.</p>

  <p>"Quite right," he answered. "If every one were to obey his orders as
  literally, there would be fewer robberies. However, you see that this man
  recognizes me."</p>

  <p>The butler turned toward an elderly gentleman in a pink coat and
  riding-breeches, who had just descended into the hall.</p>

  <p>"His lordship is here," he said. "He will give you permission, without a
  doubt. There is a gentleman from Scotland Yard, your lordship," he explained,
  "who wishes to enter the morning-room to speak with the sergeant."</p>

  <p>"Inspector John Dory, at your lordship's service," saluting. "I have been
  sent down from town to help in this little business."</p>

  <p>Lord Clenarvon smiled.</p>

  <p>"I should have thought that, under the circumstances," he said, "two of
  you would have been enough. Still, it is not for me to complain. Pray go in
  and speak to the sergeant. You will find him inside. Rather dull work for
  him, I'm afraid, and quite unnecessary."</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure, your lordship," Dory answered. "The Clenarvon diamonds
  are known all over the world, and I suppose there isn't a thieves' den in
  Europe that does not know that they will remain here exposed with your
  daughter's other wedding presents."</p>

  <p>Lord Clenarvon smiled once more and shrugged his shoulders. He was a man
  who had unbounded faith in his fellow-creatures.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he said, "it is the penalty one has to pay for historical
  possessions. Go in and talk to the sergeant, by all means, Mr. Dory. I hope
  that Graves will succeed in making you comfortable during your stay
  here."</p>

  <p>John Dory was accordingly admitted into the room which was so jealously
  guarded. At first sight, it possessed a somewhat singular appearance. The
  windows had every one of them been boarded up, and the electric lights
  consequently fully turned on. A long table stood in the middle of the
  apartment, serving as support for a long glass showcase, open at the top.
  Within this, from end to end, stretched the presents which a large circle of
  acquaintances were presenting to one of the most popular young women in
  society, on the occasion of her approaching marriage to the Duke of
  Rochester. In the middle, the wonderful Clenarvon diamonds, set in the form
  of a tiara, flashed strange lights into the somberly lit apartment. At the
  end of the table a police sergeant was sitting, with a little pile of
  newspapers and illustrated journals before him. He rose to his feet with
  alacrity at his superior's entrance.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Saunders," John Dory said. "I see you've got it pretty snug
  in here."</p>

  <p>"Pretty well, thank you, sir," Saunders answered. "Is there anything
  stirring?"</p>

  <p>John Dory looked behind to be sure that the door was closed. Then he
  stopped for a moment to gaze at the wonderful diamonds, and finally sat on
  the table by his subordinate's side.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly that, Saunders," he said. "To tell you the truth, I came down
  here because of that list of guests you sent me up."</p>

  <p>Saunders smiled.</p>

  <p>"I think I can guess the name you singled out, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>"It was Peter Ruff, of course," Dory said. "What is he doing here in the
  house, under his own name, and as a guest?"</p>

  <p>"I have asked no questions, sir," Saunders answered. "I underlined the
  name in case it might seem worth your while to make inquiries."</p>

  <p>John Dory nodded.</p>

  <p>"Nothing has happened, of course?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," Saunders answered. "You see, with the windows all boarded up,
  there is practically only the ordinary door to guard, so we feel fairly
  secure."</p>

  <p>"No one hanging about?" the detective asked. "Mr. Ruff himself, for
  instance, hasn't been trying to make your acquaintance?"</p>

  <p>"No sign of it, sir," the man answered. "I saw him pass through the hall
  yesterday afternoon, as I went off duty, and he was in riding clothes all
  splashed with mud. I think he has been hunting every day."</p>

  <p>John Dory muttered something between his lips, and turned on his heel.</p>

  <p>"How many men have you here, Saunders?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Only two, sir, beside myself," the man replied.</p>

  <p>The detective went round the boarded windows, examining the work carefully
  until he reached the door.</p>

  <p>"I am going to see if I can have a word with his lordship," he said.</p>

  <p>He caught Lord Clenarvon in the act of mounting his horse in the great
  courtyard.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Mr. Dory?" the Earl asked, stooping down.</p>

  <p>"There is one name, your lordship, among your list of guests, concerning
  which I wish to have a word with you," the detective said&mdash;"the name of
  Mr. Peter Ruff."</p>

  <p>"Don't know anything about him," Lord Clenarvon answered, cheerfully. "You
  must see my daughter, Lady Mary. It was she who sent him his invitation.
  Seems a decent little fellow, and rides as well as the best. You'll find Lady
  Mary about somewhere, if you'd like to ask her."</p>

  <p>Lord Clenarvon hurried off, with a little farewell wave of his crop, and
  John Dory returned into the house to make inquiries respecting Lady Mary. In
  a very few minutes he was shown into her presence. She smiled at him
  cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"Another detective!" she exclaimed. "I am sure I ought to feel quite safe
  now. What can I do for you, Mr. Dory?"</p>

  <p>"I have had a list of the guests sent to me," Dory answered, "in which I
  notice the name of Mr. Peter Ruff."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I have just spoken to his lordship," the detective continued, "and he
  referred me to you."</p>

  <p>"Do you want to know all about Mr. Ruff?" Lady Mary asked, smiling.</p>

  <p>"If your ladyship will pardon my saying so, I think that neither you nor
  any one else could tell me that. What I wished to say was that I understood
  that we at Scotland Yard were placed in charge of your jewels until after the
  wedding. Mr. Peter Ruff is, as you may be aware, a private detective
  himself."</p>

  <p>"I understand perfectly," Lady Mary said. "I can assure you, Mr. Dory,
  that Mr. Ruff is here entirely as a personal and very valued friend of my
  own. On two occasions he has rendered very signal service to my
  family&mdash;services which I am quite unable to requite."</p>

  <p>"In that case, your ladyship, there is nothing more to be said. I conceive
  it, however, to be my duty to tell you that in our opinion&mdash;the opinion
  of Scotland Yard&mdash;there are things about the career of Mr. Peter Ruff
  which need explanation. He is a person whom we seldom let altogether out of
  our sight."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary laughed frankly.</p>

  <p>"My dear Mr. Dory," she said, "this is one of the cases, then, in which I
  can assure you that I know more than Scotland Yard. There is no person in the
  world in whom I have more confidence, and with more reason, than Mr. Peter
  Ruff."</p>

  <p>John Dory bowed.</p>

  <p>"I thank your ladyship," he said. "I trust that your confidence will never
  be misplaced. May I ask one more question?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Lady Mary replied, "so long as you make no insinuations
  whatever against my friend."</p>

  <p>"I should be very sorry to do so," John Dory declared. "I simply wish to
  know whether Mr. Ruff has any instructions from you with reference to the
  care of your jewels?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," Lady Mary replied, decidedly. "Mr. Ruff is here entirely
  as my guest. He has been in the room with the rest of us, to look at them,
  and it was he, by the bye, who discovered a much more satisfactory way of
  boarding the windows. Anything else, Mr. Dory?"</p>

  <p>"I thank your ladyship, nothing!" the detective answered. "With your
  permission, I propose to remain here until after the ceremony."</p>

  <p>"Just as you like, of course," Lady Mary said. "I hope you will be
  comfortable."</p>

  <p>John Dory bowed, and returned to confer with his sergeant. Afterwards,
  finding the morning still fine, he took his hat and went for a walk in the
  park.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, this, in some respects the most remarkable of the
  adventures which had ever befallen Mr. Peter Ruff, came to him by accident.
  Lady Mary had read the announcement of his marriage in the paper, had driven
  at once to his office with a magnificent present, and insisted upon his
  coming with his wife to the party which was assembling at Clenarvon Court in
  honor of her own approaching wedding. Peter Ruff had taken few holidays of
  late years, and for several days had thoroughly enjoyed himself. The matter
  of the Clenarvon jewels he considered, perhaps, with a slight professional
  interest; but so far as he could see, the precautions for guarding them were
  so adequate that the subject did not remain in his memory. He had, however, a
  very distinct and disagreeable shock when, on the night of John Dory's
  appearance, he recognized among a few newly-arrived guests the Marquis de
  Sogrange. He took the opportunity, as soon as possible, of withdrawing his
  wife from a little circle among whom they had been talking, to a more retired
  corner of the room. She saw at once that something had happened to disturb
  him.</p>

  <p>"Violet," he said, "don't look behind now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I recognized him at once," she interrupted. "It is the Marquis de
  Sogrange."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"It will be best for you," he said, "not to notice him. Of course, his
  presence here may be accidental. He has a perfect right to enter any society
  he chooses. At the same time, I am uneasy."'</p>

  <p>She understood in a moment.</p>

  <p>"The Clenarvon diamonds!" she whispered. He nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is just the sort of affair which would appeal to the 'Double-Four,'"
  he said. "They are worth anything up to a quarter of a million, and it is an
  enterprise which could scarcely be attempted except by some one in a peculiar
  position. Violet, if I were not sure that he had seen me, I should leave the
  house this minute."</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked, wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"Don't you understand," Peter Ruff continued, softly, "that I myself am
  still what they call a corresponding member of the 'Double-Four,' and they
  have a right to appeal to me for help in this country, as I have a right to
  appeal to them for help or information in France? We have both made use of
  one another, to some extent. No doubt, if the Marquis has any scheme in his
  mind, he would look upon me as a valuable ally."</p>

  <p>She turned slowly pale.</p>

  <p>"Peter," she said, "you wouldn't dream&mdash;you wouldn't dare to be so
  foolish?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head firmly.</p>

  <p>"My dear girl," he said, "we talked that all out long ago. A few years
  since, I felt that I had been treated badly, that I was an alien, and that
  the hand of the law was against me. I talked wildly then, perhaps. When I put
  up my sign and sat down for clients, I meant to cheat the law, if I could.
  Things have changed, Violet. I want nothing of that sort. I have kept my
  hands clean and I mean to do so. Why, years ago," he continued, "when I was
  feeling at my wildest, these very jewels were within my grasp one foggy
  night, and I never touched them."</p>

  <p>"What would happen if you refused to help?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know," Peter Ruff answered. "The conditions are a little severe.
  But, after all, there are no hard and fast rules. It rests with the Marquis
  himself to shrug his shoulders and appreciate my position. Perhaps he may not
  even exchange a word with me. Here is Lord Sotherst coming to talk to you,
  and Captain Hamilton is waiting for me to tell him an address. Remember,
  don't recognize Sogrange."</p>

  <p>Dinner that night was an unusually cheerful meal. Peter Ruff, who was an
  excellent raconteur, told many stories. The Marquis de Sogrange was perhaps
  the next successful in his efforts to entertain his neighbors. Violet found
  him upon her left hand, and although he showed not the slightest signs of
  having ever seen her before, they were very soon excellent friends. After
  dinner, Sogrange and Peter Ruff drifted together on their way to the
  billiard-room. Sogrange, however, continued to talk courteously of trifles
  until, having decided to watch the first game, they found themselves alone on
  the leather divan surrounding the room.</p>

  <p>"This is an unexpected pleasure, my friend," Sogrange said, watching the
  ash of his cigar. "Professional?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head. "Not in the least," he answered. "I have had
  the good fortune to render Lady Mary and her brother, at different times,
  services which they are pleased to value highly. We are here as ordinary
  guests&mdash;my wife and I." The Marquis sighed.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that wife of yours, Ruff," he said. "She is charming, I admit, and
  you are a lucky man; but it was a price&mdash;a very great price to pay."</p>

  <p>"You, perhaps, are ambitious, Marquis," Peter Ruff answered. "I have not
  done so badly. A little contents me."</p>

  <p>Sogrange looked at him as though he were some strange creature.</p>

  <p>"I see!" he murmured. "I see! With you, of course, the commercial side
  comes uppermost. Mr. Ruff, what do you suppose the income from my estate
  amounts to?" Peter Ruff shook his head. He did not even know that the Marquis
  was possessed of estates!</p>

  <p>"Somewhere about seven millions of francs," Sogrange declared. "There are
  few men in Paris more extravagant than I, and I think that we Frenchmen know
  what extravagance means. But I cannot spend my income. Do you think that it
  is for the sake of gain that I have come across the Channel to add the
  Clenarvon diamonds to our coffers?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff sat very still.</p>

  <p>"You mean that?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Of course!" Sogrange answered. "Didn't you realize it directly you saw
  me? What is there, do you think, in a dull English house-party to attract a
  man like myself? Don't you understand that it is the gambler's
  instinct&mdash;the restless desire to be playing pitch-and-toss with fate,
  with honor, with life and death, if you will&mdash;that brings such as myself
  into the ranks of the 'Double-Four'? It is the weariness which kills, Peter
  Ruff. One must needs keep it from one's bones."</p>

  <p>"Marquis," Peter Ruff answered, "I do not profess to understand you. I am
  not weary of life, in fact I love it. I am looking forward to the years when
  I have enough money&mdash;and it seems as though that time is not far
  off&mdash;when I can buy a little place in the country, and hunt a little and
  shoot a little, and live a simple out-of-door life. You see, Marquis, we are
  as far removed as the poles."</p>

  <p>"Obviously!" Sogrange answered.</p>

  <p>"Your confidence," Peter Ruff continued, "the confidence with which you
  have honored me, inspires me to make you one request. I am here, indeed, as a
  friend of the family. You will not ask me to help in any designs you may have
  against the Clenarvon jewels?"</p>

  <p>Sogrange leaned back in his chair and laughed softly. His lips, when they
  parted from his white teeth, resolved themselves into lines which at that
  moment seemed to Peter Ruff more menacing than mirthful. Sogrange was, in
  many ways, a man of remarkable appearance.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Peter Ruff," he said, "you are a bourgeois little person! You should
  have been the burgomaster in a little German town, or a French mayor with a
  chain about your neck. We will see. I make no promises. All that I insist
  upon, for the present, is that you do not leave this house-party without
  advising me&mdash;that is to say, if you are really looking forward to that
  pleasant life in the country, where you will hunt a little and shoot a
  little, and grow into the likeness of a vegetable. You, with your charming
  wife! Peter Ruff, you should be ashamed to talk like that! Come, I must play
  bridge with the Countess. I am engaged for a table."</p>

  <p>The two men parted. Peter Ruff was uneasy. On his way from the room, Lord
  Sotherst insisted upon his joining a pool.</p>

  <p>"Charming fellow, Sogrange," the latter remarked, as he chalked his cue.
  "He has been a great friend of the governor's&mdash;he and his father before
  him. Our families have intermarried once or twice."</p>

  <p>"He seems very agreeable," Peter Ruff answered, devoting himself to the
  game.</p>

  <p>The following night, being the last but one before the wedding itself, a
  large dinner-party had been arranged for, and the resources of even so
  princely a mansion as Clenarvon Court were strained to their utmost by the
  entertainment of something like one hundred guests in the great
  banqueting-hall. The meal was about half-way through when those who were not
  too entirely engrossed in conversation were startled by hearing a dull,
  rumbling sound, like the moving of a number of pieces of heavy furniture.
  People looked doubtfully at one another. Peter Ruff and the Marquis de
  Sogrange were among the first to spring to their feet.</p>

  <p>"It's an explosion somewhere," the latter cried. "Sounds close at hand,
  too."</p>

  <p>They made their way out into the hall. Exactly opposite now was the room
  in which the wedding presents had been placed, and where for days nothing had
  been seen but a closed door and a man on duty outside. The door now stood
  wide open, and in place of the single electric light which was left burning
  through the evening, the place seemed almost aflame.</p>

  <p>Ruff, Sogrange and Lord Sotherst were the first three to cross the
  threshold. They were met by a rush of cold wind. Opposite to them, two of the
  windows, with their boardings, had been blown away. Sergeant Saunders was
  still sitting in his usual place at the end of the table, his head bent upon
  his folded arms. The man who had been on duty outside was standing over him,
  white with horror. Far away in the distance, down the park, one could faintly
  hear the throbbing of an engine, and Peter Ruff, through the chasm, saw the
  lights of a great motor-car flashing in and out amongst the trees. The room
  itself&mdash;the whole glittering array of presents&mdash;seemed untouched.
  Only the great center-piece&mdash;the Clenarvon diamonds&mdash;had gone. Even
  as they stood there, the rest of the guests crowding into the open door, John
  Dory tore through, his face white with excitement. Peter Ruff's calm voice
  penetrated the din of tongues.</p>

  <p>"Lord Sotherst," he said, "you have telephones in the keepers' lodges.
  There is a motor-car being driven southwards at full speed. Telephone down,
  and have your gates secured. Dory, I should keep every one out of the room.
  Some one must telephone for a doctor. I suppose your man has been hurt."</p>

  <p>The guests were wild with curiosity, but Lord Clenarvon, with an insistent
  gesture, led the way back to the diningroom.</p>

  <p>"Whatever has happened," he said, "the people who are in charge there know
  best how to deal with the situation. There is a detective from Scotland Yard
  and his subordinates, and a gentleman in whom I also have most implicit
  confidence. We will resume our dinner, if you please, ladies and
  gentlemen."</p>

  <p>Unwillingly, the people were led away. John Dory was already in his
  great-coat, ready to spring into the powerful motor-car which had been
  ordered out from the garage. A doctor, who had been among the guests, was
  examining the man Saunders, who sat in that still, unnatural position at the
  head of the table.</p>

  <p>"The poor fellow has been shot in the back of the head with some peculiar
  implement," he said. "The bullet is very long&mdash;almost like a
  needle&mdash;and it seems to have penetrated very nearly to the base of the
  brain."</p>

  <p>"Is he dead?" Peter Ruff asked.</p>

  <p>The doctor shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No!" he answered. "An inch higher up and he must have died at once. I
  want some of the men-servants to help me carry him to a bedroom, and plenty
  of hot water. Some one else must go for my instrument case."</p>

  <p>Lord Sotherst took these things in charge, and John Dory turned to the man
  whom they had found standing over him.</p>

  <p>"Tell us exactly what happened," he said, briefly.</p>

  <p>"I was standing outside the door," the man answered. "I heard no sound
  inside&mdash;there was nothing to excite suspicion in any way. Suddenly there
  was this explosion. It took me, perhaps, thirty or forty seconds to get the
  key out of my pocket and unlock the door. When I entered, the side of the
  room was blown in like that, the diamonds were gone, Saunders was leaning
  forward just in the position he is in now, and there wasn't another soul in
  sight. Then you and the others came."</p>

  <p>John Dory rushed from the room; they had brought him word that the car was
  waiting. At such a moment, he was ready even to forget his ancient enmity. He
  turned towards Peter Ruff, whose calm bearing somehow or other impressed even
  the detective with a sense of power.</p>

  <p>"Will you come along?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Dory, no!" he said. "I am glad you have asked me, but I think
  you had better go alone."</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, the pursuit was started. Saunders was carried out of
  the room, followed by the doctor. There remained only Peter Ruff and the man
  who had been on duty outside. Peter Ruff seated himself where Saunders had
  been sitting, and seemed to be closely examining the table all round for some
  moments. Once he took up something from between the pages of the book which
  the Sergeant had apparently been reading, and put it carefully into his own
  pocketbook. Then he leaned back in the chair, with his hands clasped behind
  his head and his eyes fixed upon the ceiling, as though thinking
  intently.</p>

  <p>"Hastings," he said to the policeman, who all the time was pursuing a
  stream of garrulous, inconsequent remarks, "I wonder whether you'd step
  outside and see Mr. Richards, the butler. Ask him if he would be so good as
  to spare me a moment."</p>

  <p>"I'll do it, sir," the man answered, with one more glance through the open
  space. "Lord!" he added, "they must have been in through there and out again
  like cats!"</p>

  <p>"It was quick work, certainly," Peter Ruff answered, genially, "but then,
  an enterprise like this would, of course, only be attempted by experts."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff was not left alone long. Mr. Richards came hurrying in.</p>

  <p>"This is a terrible business, sir!" he said. "His lordship has excused me
  from superintending the service of the dinner. Anything that I can do for you
  I am to give my whole attention to. These were my orders."</p>

  <p>"Very good of you, Richards," Peter Ruff answered, "very thoughtful of his
  lordship. In the first place, then, I think, we will have the rest of this
  jewelry packed in cases at once. Not that anything further is likely to
  happen," he continued, "but still, it would be just as well out of the way. I
  will remain here and superintend this, if you will send a couple of careful
  servants. In the meantime, I want you to do something else for me."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir," the man answered.</p>

  <p>"I want a plan of the house," Peter Ruff said, "with the names of the
  guests who occupy this wing."</p>

  <p>The butler nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"I can supply you with it very shortly, sir," he said. "There is no
  difficulty at all about the plan, as I have several in my room; but it will
  take me some minutes to pencil in the names."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"I will superintend things here until you return," he said.</p>

  <p>"It is to be hoped, sir," the man said, as he retreated, "that the
  gentleman from Scotland Yard will catch the thieves. After all, they hadn't
  more than ten minutes' start, and our Daimler is a flyer."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I hope so," Peter Ruff answered, heartily.</p>

  <p>But, alas! no such fortune was in store for Mr. John Dory. At daybreak he
  returned in a borrowed trap from a neighboring railway station.</p>

  <p>"Our tires had been cut," he said, in reply to a storm of questions. "They
  began to go, one after the other, as soon as we had any speed on. We traced
  the car to Salisbury, and there isn't a village within forty miles that isn't
  looking out for it."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff, who had just returned from an early morning walk, nodded
  sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"Shall you be here all day, Mr. Dory?" he asked. "There's just a word or
  two I should like to have with you."</p>

  <p>Dory turned away. He had forced himself, in the excitement of the moment,
  to speak to his ancient enemy, but in this hour of his humility the man's
  presence was distasteful to him.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," he said, shortly. "It depends on how things may turn
  out."</p>

  <p>The daily life at Clenarvon Court proceeded exactly as usual. Breakfast
  was served early, as there was to be big day's shoot. The Marquis de Sogrange
  and Peter Ruff smoked their cigarettes together afterwards in the great hall.
  Then it was that Peter Ruff took the plunge.</p>

  <p>"Marquis," he said, "I should like to know exactly how I stand with
  you&mdash;the 'Double-Four,' that is to say&mdash;supposing I range myself
  for an hour or so on the side of the law?"</p>

  <p>Sogrange smiled.</p>

  <p>"You amuse yourself, Mr. Ruff," he remarked genially.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," Peter Ruff answered. "I am serious."</p>

  <p>Sogrange watched the blue cigarette smoke come down his nose.</p>

  <p>"My dear friend," he said, "I am no amateur at this game. When I choose to
  play it, I am not afraid of Scotland Yard. I am not afraid," he concluded,
  with a little bow, "even of you!"</p>

  <p>"Do you ever bet, Marquis?" Peter Ruff asked.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-five thousand francs," Sogrange said, smiling, "that your efforts
  to aid Mr. John Dory are unavailing."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff entered the amount in his pocketbook. "It is a bargain," he
  declared. "Our bet, I presume, carries immunity for me?"</p>

  <p>"By all means," Sogrange answered, with a little bow.</p>

  <p>The Marquis beckoned to Lord Sotherst, who was crossing the hall.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he said, "do tell me the name of your hatter in London.
  Delions failed me at the last moment, and I have not a hat fit for the
  ceremony to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"I'll lend you half-a-dozen, if you can wear them," Lord Sotherst
  answered, smiling. "The governor's sure to have plenty, too."</p>

  <p>Sogrange touched his head with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Alas!" he said. "My head is small, even for a Frenchman's. Imagine
  me&mdash;otherwise, I trust, suitably attired&mdash;walking to the church
  to-morrow in a hat which came to my ears!"</p>

  <p>Lord Sotherst laughed.</p>

  <p>"Scotts will do you all right," he said. "You can telephone."</p>

  <p>"I shall send my man up," Sogrange determined. "He can bring me back a
  selection. Tell me, at what hour is the first drive this morning, and are the
  places drawn yet?"</p>

  <p>"Come into the gun-room and we'll see," Lord Sotherst answered.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff made his way to the back quarters of the house. In a little
  sitting-room he found the man he sought, sitting alone. Peter Ruff closed the
  door behind him.</p>

  <p>"John Dory," he said, "I have come to have a few words with you."</p>

  <p>The detective rose to his feet. He was in no pleasant mood. Though the
  telephone wires had been flashing their news every few minutes, it seemed,
  indeed, as though the car which they had chased had vanished into space.</p>

  <p>"What do you want to say to me?" he asked gruffly.</p>

  <p>"I want, if I can," Peter Ruff said earnestly, "to do you a service."</p>

  <p>Dory's eyes glittered.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "that I can do without your services."</p>

  <p>"Don't be foolish," Peter Ruff said. "You are harboring a grievance
  against me which is purely an imaginary one. Now listen to the facts. You
  employ your wife&mdash;which after all, Dory, I think, was not quite the
  straight thing&mdash;to try and track down a young man named Spencer
  Fitzgerald, who was formerly, in a small way, a client of mine. I find your
  wife an agreeable companion&mdash;we become friends. Then I discover her
  object, and know that I am being fooled. The end of that little episode you
  remember. But tell me why should you bear me ill-will for defending my friend
  and myself?"</p>

  <p>The detective came slowly up to Peter Ruff. He took hold of the lapel of
  the other's coat with his left hand, and his right hand was clenched. But
  Peter Ruff did not falter.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me," said Dory. "I will tell you what grudge I bear against
  you. It was your entertainment of my wife which gave her the taste for luxury
  and for gadding about. Mind, I don't blame you for that altogether, but there
  the fact remains. She left me. She went on the stage."</p>

  <p>"Stop!" Peter Ruff said. "You must still hold me blameless. She wrote to
  me. I went out with her once. The only advice I gave her was to return to
  you. So far as I am concerned, I have treated her with the respect that I
  would have shown my own sister."</p>

  <p>"You lie!" Dory cried, fiercely. "A month ago, I saw her come to your
  fiat. I watched for hours. She did not leave it&mdash;she did not leave it
  all that night!"</p>

  <p>"If you object to her visit," Peter Ruff said quietly, "it is my wife whom
  you must blame."</p>

  <p>John Dory relaxed his hand and took a quick step backwards.</p>

  <p>"Your wife?" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Exactly!" Peter Ruff answered. "Maud&mdash;Mrs. Dory&mdash;called to see
  me; she was ill&mdash;she had lost her situation&mdash;she was even, I
  believe, faint and hungry. I was not present. My wife talked to her and was
  sorry for her. While the two women were there together, your wife fainted.
  She was put to bed in our one spare room, and she has been shown every
  attention and care. Tell me, how long is it since you were at home?"</p>

  <p>"Not for ten days," Dory answered, bitterly. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because when you go back, you will find your wife there," Peter Ruff
  answered. "She has given up the stage. Her one desire is to settle down and
  repay you for the trouble she has caused you. You needn't believe me unless
  you like. Ask my wife. She is here. She will tell you."</p>

  <p>Dory was overcome. He went back to his seat by the window, and he buried
  his face for a moment in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Ruff," he said, "I don't deserve this. I've had bad times lately, though.
  Everything has gone against me. I think I have been a bit careless, with the
  troubles at home and that."</p>

  <p>"Stop!" Peter Ruff insisted. "Now I come to the immediate object of my
  visit to you. You have had some bad luck at headquarters. I know of it. I am
  going to help you to reinstate yourself brilliantly. With that, let us shake
  hands and bury all the soreness that there may be between us."</p>

  <p>John Dory stared at his visitor.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I do," answered Peter. "Please do not think that I mean to make any
  reflection upon your skill. It is just a chance that I was able to see what
  you were not able to see. In an hour's time, you shall restore the Clenarvon
  diamonds to Lord Clenarvon. You shall take the reward which he has just
  offered, of a thousand pounds. And I promise you that the manner in which you
  shall recover the jewels shall be such that you will be famous for a long
  time to come."</p>

  <p>"You are a wonderful man!" said Dory, hoarsely. "Do you mean, then, that
  the jewels were not with those men in the motor-car?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not!" Peter Ruff answered. "But come along. The story will
  develop."</p>

  <p>At half-past ten that morning, a motor-car turned out from the garage at
  Clenarvon Court, and made its way down the avenue. In it was a single
  passenger&mdash;the dark-faced Parisian valet of the Marquis de Sogrange. As
  the car left the avenue and struck into the main road, it was hailed by Peter
  Ruff and John Dory, who were walking together along the lane.</p>

  <p>"Say, my man," Peter Ruff said, addressing the chauffeur, "are you going
  to the station?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir!" the man answered. "I am taking down the Marquis de Sogrange's
  servant to catch the eleven o'clock train to town."</p>

  <p>"You don't mind giving us a lift?" Peter Ruff asked, already opening the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not, sir," the man answered, touching his hat.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff and John Dory stepped into the tonneau of the car. The man
  civilly lifted the hatbox from the seat, and made room for his enforced
  companions. Nevertheless, it was easy to see that he was not pleased.</p>

  <p>"There's plenty of room here for three," Peter Ruff said, cheerfully, as
  they sat on either side of him. "Drive slowly, please, chauffeur. Now, Mr.
  Lemprise," Peter Ruff added, "we will trouble you to change places."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" the man called out, suddenly pale as death.</p>

  <p>He was held as though in a vice. John Dory's arm was through his on one
  side, and Peter Ruff's on the other. Apart from that, the muzzle of a
  revolver was pressed to his forehead.</p>

  <p>"On second thoughts," Peter Ruff said, "I think we will keep you like
  this. Driver," he called out, "please return to the Court at once."</p>

  <p>The man hesitated.</p>

  <p>"You recognize the gentleman who is with me?" Peter Ruff said. "He is the
  detective from Scotland Yard. I have full authority from Lord Clenarvon over
  all his servants. Please do as I say."</p>

  <p>The man hesitated no more. The car was backed and turned, the Frenchman
  struggling all the way like a wild cat. Once he tried to kick the hatbox into
  the road, but John Dory was too quick for him. So they drove up to the front
  door of the Court, to be welcomed with cries of astonishment from the whole
  of the shooting party, who were just starting. Foremost among them was
  Sogrange. They crowded around the car. Peter Ruff touched the hatbox with his
  foot.</p>

  <p>"If we could trouble your Lordship," he said, "to open that hatbox, you
  will find something that will interest you. Mr. Dory has planned a little
  surprise for you, in which I have been permitted to help."</p>

  <p>The women, who gathered that something was happening, came hastening out
  from the hall. They all crowded round Lord Clenarvon, who was cutting through
  the leather strap of the hatbox. Inside the silk hat which reposed there,
  were the Clenarvon diamonds. Monsieur le Marquis de Sogrange was one of the
  foremost to give vent to an exclamation of delight.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur le Marquis," Peter Ruff said, "this should be a lesson to you, I
  hope, to have the characters of your servants more rigidly verified. Mr. Dory
  tells me that this man came into your employ at the last moment with a forged
  recommendation. He is, in effect, a dangerous thief."</p>

  <p>"You amaze me!" Sogrange exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"We are all interested in this affair," Peter Ruff said, "and my friend
  John Dory here is, perhaps, too modest properly to explain the matter. If you
  care to come with me, we can reconstruct, in a minute, the theft."</p>

  <p>John Dory and Peter Ruff first of all handed over their captive, who was
  now calm and apparently resigned, to the two policemen who were still on duty
  in the Court. Afterwards, Peter Ruff led the way up one flight of stairs, and
  turned the handle of the door of an apartment exactly over the morning-room.
  It was the bedroom of the Marquis de Sogrange.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Dory's chase in the motor-car," he said, "was, as you have doubtless
  gathered now, merely a blind. It was obvious to his intelligence that the
  blowing away of the window was merely a ruse to cover the real method of the
  theft. If you will allow me, I will show you how it was done."</p>

  <p>The floor was of hardwood, covered with rugs. One of these, near the
  fireplace, Peter Ruff brushed aside. The seventh square of hardwood from the
  mantelpiece had evidently been tampered with. With very little difficulty, he
  removed it.</p>

  <p>"You see," he explained, "the ceiling of the room below is also of paneled
  wood. Having removed this, it is easy to lift the second one, especially as
  light screws have been driven in and string threaded about them. There is now
  a hole through which you can see into the room below. Has Dory returned? Ah,
  here he is!"</p>

  <p>The detective came hurrying into the room, bearing in his hand a
  peculiar-shaped weapon, a handful of little darts like those which had been
  found in the wounded man's head, and an ordinary fishing-rod in a linen
  case.</p>

  <p>"There is the weapon," Peter Ruff said, "which it was easy enough to fire
  from here upon the man who was leaning forward exactly below. Then here, you
  will see, is a somewhat peculiar instrument, which shows a great deal of
  ingenuity in its details."</p>

  <p>He opened the linen case, which was, by the bye, secured by a padlock, and
  drew out what was, to all appearance, an ordinary fishing-rod, fitted at the
  end with something that looked like an iron hand. Peter Ruff dropped it
  through the hole until it reached the table, moved it backwards and forwards,
  and turned round with a smile.</p>

  <p>"You see," he said, "the theft, after all, was very simple. Personally, I
  must admit that it took me a great deal by surprise, but my friend Mr. Dory
  has been on the right track from the first. I congratulate him most
  heartily."</p>

  <p>Dory was a little overcome. Lady Mary shook him heartily by the hand, but
  as they trooped downstairs she stooped and whispered in Peter Ruff's ear.</p>

  <p>"I wonder how much of this was John Dory," she said, smiling.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff said nothing. The detective was already on the telephone,
  wiring his report to London. Every one was standing about in little knots,
  discussing this wonderful event. Sogrange sought Lord Clenarvon, and walked
  with him, arm in arm, down the stairs.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you, Clenarvon," he said, "how sorry I am that I should
  have been the means of introducing a person like this to the house. I had the
  most excellent references from the Prince of Strelitz. No doubt they were
  forged. My own man was taken ill just before I left, and I had to bring some
  one."</p>

  <p>"My dear Sogrange," Lord Clenarvon said, "don't think of it. What we must
  be thankful for is that we had so brilliant a detective in the house."</p>

  <p>"As John Dory?" Sogrange remarked, with a smile. Lord Clenarvon
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "I don't see why we should lose a day's sport because the
  diamonds have been recovered. I always felt that they would turn up again
  some day or other. You are keen, I know, Sogrange."</p>

  <p>"Rather!" the Marquis answered. "But excuse me for one moment. There is
  Mrs. Ruff looking charming there in the corner. I must have just a word with
  her."</p>

  <p>He crossed the room and bowed before Violet.</p>

  <p>"My dear lady," he said, "I have come to congratulate you. You have a
  clever husband&mdash;a little cleverer, even, than I thought. I have just had
  the misfortune to lose to him a bet of twenty-five thousand francs."</p>

  <p>Violet smiled, a little uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Peter doesn't gamble as a rule," she remarked.</p>

  <p>Sogrange sighed.</p>

  <p>"This, alas, was no gamble!" he said. "He was betting upon certainties,
  but he won. Will you tell him from me, when you see him, that although I have
  not the money in my pocket at the moment, I shall pay my debts. Tell him that
  we are as careful to do that in France as we are to keep our word!"</p>

  <p>He bowed, and passed out with the shooting-party on to the terrace. Peter
  Ruff came up, a few minutes later, and his wife gave him the message.</p>

  <p>"I did that man an injustice," Peter Ruff said with a sigh of relief. "I
  can't explain now, dear. I'll tell you all about it later in the day."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing wrong, is there?" she asked him, pleadingly.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," Peter Ruff declared, "everything is right. I have made
  friends with Dory, and I have won a thousand pounds. When we leave here, I am
  going to look out for that little estate in the country. If you come out with
  the lunch, dear, I want you to watch that man Hamilton's coat. It's exactly
  what I should like to wear myself at my own shooting parties. See if you can
  make a sketch of it when he isn't looking."</p>

  <p>Violet laughed.</p>
