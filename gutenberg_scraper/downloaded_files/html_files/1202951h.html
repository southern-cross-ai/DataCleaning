  <h3>EDITOR'S NOTE FROM <i>THE COSMOPOLITAN</i></h3>

  <p class="note">"The Long Arm of Mannister" stories are connected through a
  main idea which may be briefly explained to the reader. Mannister is the
  victim of a band of conspirators, who have sought to bring about his ruin.
  Undaunted by the great odds against him, Mannister sets out to overcome his
  enemies. Circumstances are such that he is obliged to map out an entirely
  different plan of procedure against each of the conspirators, whom, one by
  one, he brings to grief.</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Cosmopolitan</i>, Oct 1907</h3>

  <p class="first">"LOOK behind&mdash;once more," the woman gasped, stooping a
  little from the saddle.</p>

  <p>Even with that slight movement she swayed and almost fell. The man's hand
  supported her&mdash;he only knew with what an effort.</p>

  <p>"There is no one in sight," he muttered, but he did not look. His heart
  was sick with the accumulated fear of these awful months.</p>

  <p>They stumbled on again&mdash;a weary, heart-sickening procession. The
  woman's eyes were half closed, her cheeks were as pale as death, her black
  hair was powdered with dust, her clothing soiled and worn. She rode a small
  Mexican pony, itself in the last stage of exhaustion. By her side, on foot,
  with his left hand locked in the reins, the man staggered along. In her face
  was the white numbness of despair, the despair which takes no count of living
  terrors. In his the shadow of an awful fear remained. His eyes were glazed
  and framed in deep black rims. His mouth was open like a dog's, his knees
  trembled as he ran. Once the woman had turned her head, and seeing him had
  shivered. He reminded her of one of those prairie wolves, into whose carcass
  the bullet from the last cartridge in his revolver had found its way. If her
  lips could have borne the effort, she would have smiled at the idea that it
  was for love of such a man that she had thrown away her life. The terror of
  this unending chase had eaten the manhood out of him. He had no longer any
  hope, any courage. He followed only the blind impulse of the hunted
  animal&mdash;to flee. He wore shirt and trousers only, his socks had gone,
  his feet were bleeding through the gaps in his rent shoes. Yet he had held
  himself bravely enough once in the great world, before the cup of Iseult had
  touched his lips.</p>

  <p>A speck in front&mdash;a sombre blur upon the landscape. He saw it and
  pointed. The effort of stretching out his hand overbalanced him. He fell in a
  heap upon the rough roadway, and for a moment lay still. Her pony also
  halted, trembling in every limb, his fore-legs planted outwards, his nose
  close to the ground.</p>

  <p>She leaned down towards him.</p>

  <p>"Gaston," she cried feebly, "are you hurt?"</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet, and as he did so she noticed that he kept his head
  studiously turned away from the direction whence they had come. He shook the
  dust from his rags of clothing, and he gathered the reins once more into his
  hands. Of his hurts, if he had received 'any, he took no more notice than a
  dumb animal.</p>

  <p>"Come on," he gasped. "There is wooded country ahead. We may find shelters
  Come!"</p>

  <p>"Look behind," she directed.</p>

  <p>"No!" he answered, shivering.</p>

  <p>"Look behind&mdash;I wish it," she insisted. "It is better to know."</p>

  <p>Slowly he turned his head. There was little room for expression left in
  his face, but she saw the slow dilation of his eyes, the animal drop of his
  jaw. He stood as one turned to stone, gazing back along the way by which they
  had come. As the woman understood, she drew one long sigh and slipped from
  the saddle, mercifully unconscious. The man did not heed her. His eyes were
  still fixed upon that speck in the distance, a cloud of dust, a man on
  horseback. Curiously enough, his most poignant feeling was one of relief. It
  was the end at last then, the end of a chase surely more terrible than any
  since the days when sin itself was born.</p>

  <p>She opened her eyes for a moment.</p>

  <p>"It is he?" she questioned.</p>

  <p>"It is he," the man repeated, as one might tell the time to a
  stranger.</p>

  <p>She pointed to the revolver in his belt, but he shook his head. She
  remembered that his cartridges were all gone.</p>

  <p>"Kill me some other way," she pleaded.</p>

  <p>"I could not," he answered. "I am not strong enough. I have no strength
  left. We have been very foolish, Christine. We should have waited in the
  city. There it would have been man to man at least. Now I am broken. I cannot
  strike a blow. I cannot even kill myself. I cannot kill you. I have no
  strength left. This flight by night and by day has robbed me of it. It was
  foolish!"</p>

  <p>She turned her face to the ground with a little sob.</p>

  <p>"I will hold my breath and die," she declared. "He shall not see me like
  this."</p>

  <p>The man stared at her dully. What did it matter, the rents in her
  garments, such trifles in the presence of death. He was a stupid fellow, and
  he had never gauged the measure of a woman's vanity.</p>

  <p>The speck in the distance grew more distinct, the cloud of dust larger.
  Then there came to the man a last access of strength, a strength wholly
  artificial, begotten of the terror which lay like ice upon his heart. He
  plucked at the woman and half helped, half pushed her upon the waiting
  pony.</p>

  <p>"He will catch us! He is here at last, Christine," he jabbered. "We must
  get to the wood. Perhaps we can hide, and strike him down when he is looking
  for us. I have a stone in my pocket I picked up. It is sharp&mdash;sharp as a
  knife! If I could get behind him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The woman shivered, but she suffered herself to be led. The pony staggered
  on as though every step might be its last. The man ran, breathing like a
  crazy machine, and with face almost black. And in their hearts they both knew
  that it was useless. Their pursuer was only cantering his horse, and he was
  gaining at every stride. Down the wind came the sound of his voice, the voice
  of the untired man who triumphs.</p>

  <p>"Gently, my friends, gently! Do you not see that it is I, Mannister, who
  calls? Why do you hurry so?"</p>

  <p>Over on his face went the hunted man, nerveless, and stricken with a new
  fear at the sound of that mocking voice. The pony stopped and
  swayed&mdash;collapsing rather than falling in the rough way. The woman lay
  there with her face to the earth and her arms stretched out. The man
  commenced to groan like a stricken animal, or else he too might have been
  taken for dead. So they lay when their pursuer, on a great bay mare as yet
  untired, rode up to them.</p>

  <p>He sat on his horse looking from one to the other. He was a man of
  something apparently less than middle age, with smooth fair hair and face,
  which the hand of time seemed to have treated kindly. Only a sudden and very
  terrible light flashed in his eyes as he looked downward at the woman, a
  light which lingered, however, but for that single second, and passed away
  leaving his whole expression nonchalant, almost undisturbed.</p>

  <p>"Upon my word," he observed, resting his left hand lightly upon his
  horse's flank, "I am distressed to have been the cause of so much suffering.
  You have been unreasonable, my dear Gaston, to force a lady into undertaking
  a journey such as this. A few words with you&mdash;that was all I asked.
  Surely it was not worth while to have given me all this trouble, and to have
  put yourselves to such inconvenience! My dear Christine, I must confess that
  the state of your wardrobe distresses me!"</p>

  <p>Her shoulders shook, but she did not look up.</p>

  <p>"And you too, my dear Gaston," he continued, sitting still easily upon his
  horse and lighting a cigarette. "I must confess that it pains me to see you
  in such guise. We met last&mdash;I think that it was at the Cavalry Club, the
  day young Pennant tried to wear a roll collar with a dress coat. I remember
  your remarks upon the occasion, scathing but well deserved. You were always
  our recognized authority upon matters of the person. It grieves me to see you
  like this, Gaston. Is that indeed a shirt, the remnants of which you are
  still wearing! And, my dear fellow, pardon me, but your feet and
  hands&mdash;every finger-nail gone, I declare. I am ashamed to ask you, but
  upon my word&mdash;when did you take a bath last?"</p>

  <p>The man called Gaston staggered to his feet. With the poor remnants of his
  strength, he threw himself against his persecutor, his nervous, bony fingers
  locked around the stone which was his only weapon. It was after all but a
  pitiful effort. The newcomer touched his horse with the spur, and his
  assailant rolled in the dust.</p>

  <p>"Get up, my friend," the former remarked pleasantly, looking downwards.
  "You and I must have our little conversation together, I suppose. Let us go
  as far as the wood there. We shall be better alone."</p>

  <p>Slowly and painfully the fallen man staggered to his feet. The newcomer
  withdrew one foot from its stirrup.</p>

  <p>"Hold on to this," he directed. "I will ride carefully."</p>

  <p>It was barely a hundred yards to the border of the wood, but more than
  once the man faltered and almost collapsed. When at last they reached their
  destination, the sudden change from the dazzling sunlight to the cool
  darkness of the thick trees was too much for him. He groped for a moment like
  a drunken man, then staggered forward and fell. Mannister stooped down and
  dragged him to his feet. For a moment he held him at arm's length, studying
  him with all the immeasurable contempt of the brave man for a proven coward.
  Then he placed him on a fallen log with his back to a tree trunk.</p>

  <p>"Don't shake so, man," he said, feeling in his pocket and producing a
  flask. "Drink some of this. It will give you the sort of courage you
  need."</p>

  <p>Gaston Sinclair grabbed at the flask, a sudden gleam of desire flashing in
  his glazed eyes. His nerveless fingers failed utterly to loosen the stopper.
  Mannister leaned over and took the flask from the hand which still clung
  almost passionately to it.</p>

  <p>"You shall have your drink," he said. "Don't be afraid. Here!"</p>

  <p>A turn of his strong sinewy fingers, and the stopper was out. He poured
  some of the brandy into a silver cup and held it out to the other man.</p>

  <p>"Drink," he said. "Take it all! Don't be afraid. There is no poison
  there!"</p>

  <p>The man drank and gasped and drank again. Mannister turned from him with
  the air of one who seeks to avoid an ugly sight. He looked through a gap in
  the trees out on to the plain, his eyes travelled backwards along that rough
  road to where the woman still lay. As he watched she moved her position,
  sitting up on the roadside, her head buried in her hands, her attitude,
  notwithstanding her soiled and dishevelled clothes, reminiscent of a former
  subtle and notable elegance. The man's face remained unchanged, but his
  fingers dug into the bark of the fallen tree on which they sat. This woman
  had been his wife. She had lain in his arms, her lips against his, her
  passionate whispering like wonderful music in his ears. She had been
  his&mdash;she had loved him for it while at any rate&mdash;perhaps even now!
  And she had brought him into the shadow of the greatest tragedy which men and
  women have woven out of the loom of life. She had left him for this creature
  by his side; left him, and he had become that most pitiable object on the
  face of the earth&mdash;a forsaken husband. Yet he felt no anger for
  her&mdash;little even for the poor companion of her flight. Understanding had
  come to him during the long nights and weary days of his wonderful chase. Up
  and down the world, across continents and seas, through great cities and
  across the desert places he had followed them, his hand ever stretched out,
  until the fear which never left them had become a living thing, and their
  journeying a nerveless hysterical flight. He had left them no peace, no
  respite. When in some out of the way corner of the world they had fancied
  themselves secure for a time, a telegram had been handed to them&mdash;"I am
  coming"&mdash;and the chase began anew. And this was the end. They were
  broken&mdash;absolutely at his mercy&mdash;broken body and soul. He lit
  another cigarette, and turned away from the contemplation of that bent
  figure. Life, after all, was an unsatisfying thing.</p>

  <p>He turned round suddenly. Sinclair had armed himself with a short stick,
  and his hand was lifted to strike. Mannister laughed as he struck down his
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool," he said scornfully. "Can't you see that if I meant to
  kill you I could have twisted your neck at any moment? Sit down and listen to
  me."</p>

  <p>Sinclair gasped.</p>

  <p>"Give me another drink," he begged. Mannister measured him out a small
  quantity.</p>

  <p>"No more," he said firmly. "Sit down now. I want to talk to you."</p>

  <p>The man grovelled before him. His brain, giddy with the fumes of the
  spirit, held but one thought. He was to live! Mannister did not mean to kill
  him! It was unnatural&mdash;impossible!</p>

  <p>"You are going to kill us, to kill us both!" he cried, in a frenzied
  whisper. "We heard of the oath you took. A year ago I could have met you like
  a man. Today we are broken, both of us. We have lived and slept with fear so
  long."</p>

  <p>"Your lives," Mannister answered calmly, "are not worth a stray pin to me.
  Live or die, I am indifferent. You will come to no harm from me. If I have
  desired vengeance," he added, with a faint smile, "don't you think that I
  have it? You are not the Gaston Sinclair that you were, my friend. The lady,
  your companion, too, has apparently suffered."</p>

  <p>Sinclair's body was shaken with groans.</p>

  <p>"If only we could have stopped," he moaned. "Oh, it is terrible to be
  hunted! You begin to run&mdash;and you can't stop. You want to turn round and
  face the thing behind&mdash;and you can't. And your nerves snap one by one,
  and your courage dies; you forget that you are a human being. You rush
  blindly on, always terrified. Every time you look behind your heart sinks; in
  every crowd you search frantically for one face; every resting place you
  enter with a sob of fear. Locked doors are useless. There is a knock! You
  must open! A waiter perhaps, but the sweat is on your forehead, you are
  shaking like a leaf. The man thinks you are mad. Everywhere you are
  suspected&mdash;shunned. Every pair of eyes that meets yours seems to carry
  behind them the knowledge that you are running away. Oh, Hell! It is Hell,
  Hell!"</p>

  <p>"This," Mannister declared, with a pleasant smile, "is most interesting.
  You have had quite an experience, my dear Sinclair, and you speak of it most
  eloquently. Now you will kindly abandon this somewhat melodramatic attitude
  of yours, and&mdash;listen to me."</p>

  <p>The last three words were spoken with a sudden tense note of command.
  Sinclair, whose head had sunk between his hands, looked slowly up.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he said.</p>

  <p>"When I first left England and followed you to Genoa," Mannister said, "my
  intentions were perfectly simple, and I may add absolutely primitive. I meant
  to kill you both on sight. I lost time just at first, and the chase became a
  long one. Lately I have had advises from England&mdash;and I begin to
  understand the game. It was a little more complex than I thought at first. It
  was a little more complex, I think, than you fully understood."</p>

  <p>"I was a fool!" Sinclair groaned, "a hopeless, miserable fool!"</p>

  <p>"You were the tool of clever men," Mannister continued. "So was I. It was
  part of a conspiracy. I can see that now. And while I have been away our
  friends over there have proceeded to strip me bare and divide the plunder.
  What was your share, my dear friend?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you anything about it," Sinclair groaned. "You know very
  well that I cannot. You know the penalty."</p>

  <p>Mannister smiled.</p>

  <p>"You will never," he remarked suavely, "be nearer death than you are just
  now."</p>

  <p>There was silence for several moments between the two men. The little wood
  was singularly free from all animal noises, not even a breath of wind was
  stirring in the trees. Mannister spoke again.</p>

  <p>"You will probably," he said, "never come back to England. In that case
  you are safe from our friends. You have at least a chance of escape. From me,
  unless you obey, you have none."</p>

  <p>"I thought you said that you were not going to kill me," Sinclair declared
  sullenly.</p>

  <p>"Under reasonable conditions, no!" Mannister said. "Such desire as I had
  for vengeance is&mdash;well, shall we say gratified. You will never be the
  man you were again, Sinclair."</p>

  <p>"Curse you!" Sinclair answered bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Curse those others&mdash;and your own vanity&mdash;not me," Mannister
  replied. "I wish you no further harm now than has already come to you. But
  the truth I mean to know, and as surely as you refuse to tell me, so surely
  do you die!"</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. Sinclair was thinking of all the things from
  which he must cut himself off for ever, the clubs, the restaurants, the city
  haunts and friends&mdash;all these things must go. And yet it was something
  to live! Only an hour ago, life itself would have seemed a priceless and
  wonderful gift. It was no time to bargain.</p>

  <p>"It was Colin Stevens who planned it," he said slowly. "There were seven
  of the others who were in it."</p>

  <p>"The names of the other seven?" Mannister demanded.</p>

  <p>"Colin Stevens was the leader," Sinclair repeated, unwillingly.</p>

  <p>"The names of the other seven," Mannister said calmly, "or I shall wring
  your neck. It is not a pleasant death."</p>

  <p>"Phil Rundermere."</p>

  <p>"The blackguard! I saved him from ruin once!" Mannister whispered softly.
  "Go on!"</p>

  <p>"John Dykes."</p>

  <p>"Of course! Well?"</p>

  <p>"Sophy de la Mere."</p>

  <p>"Ladies, too!" Mannister murmured. "Well, she had no cause to love me. Go
  on."</p>

  <p>"Fred Hambledon."</p>

  <p>"Good! Who else?"</p>

  <p>"Benjamin Traske."</p>

  <p>"Poor boy! He went where he was led, of course. That makes five."</p>

  <p>"Ernest Jacobs."</p>

  <p>"False little brute!" Mannister murmured. "I judged he must have been in
  it. One more, Sinclair."</p>

  <p>"You know enough," Sinclair muttered. "Let the other one go. He was led
  into it, as I was. He never did you any real injury."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not, Sinclair," Mannister answered smoothly, "but nevertheless a
  bargain is a bargain, if you please. I must know his name. Or shall I guess
  it? Dick Polsover, eh? Ah, I thought so! Your own particular friend,
  Sinclair. Well, it's hard to have to give him away, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"You know their names now," Sinclair said, with a sudden gleam of
  curiosity. "What are you going to do? You cannot go back to England! You
  would never face it!"</p>

  <p>"I am not quite so sure about that, my over sanguine friend," Mannister
  answered. "If ever I do, you may go down on your knees and pray for those
  eight men&mdash;if you think it will do them any good. By-the-bye, you, I
  suppose, were the decoy to get me out of England. It was for that purpose
  that you made love to my wife. What did you get out of it?"</p>

  <p>"Five thousand pounds!" Sinclair answered. "I was to have had more, but it
  has never come."</p>

  <p>"A bad bargain," Mannister declared.</p>

  <p>"Why, you must have spent nearly that running away from me."</p>

  <p>"We have spent it all," Sinclair answered. "We have not enough to live on
  for a month."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," Mannister declared, swinging his riding boot against the
  trunk of the tree, "that in making you a present of the gift of life, I am
  not doing you a very great service&mdash;you or the woman who is now
  dependent upon you. You will have to work, Sinclair, I am afraid. You never
  liked work, did you?"</p>

  <p>"Haven't you nearly finished with me?" Sinclair answered. "I must look
  after&mdash;her. We need food."</p>

  <p>"You will find plenty in the wagon outside," Mannister answered. "The lady
  whom you tactfully allude to as 'her,' is already being attended to. I have a
  fancy for travelling comfortably, and notwithstanding this attack upon my
  fortunes, I am not quite a pauper. Do you know, Sinclair, I fancy that our
  eight friends may have been just a little disappointed. I never believed in
  keeping all my eggs in one basket. They looked upon me as a sort of Monte
  Cristo, but there were more treasure caves than one. Come, Sinclair, we will
  go. I have learned from you all that I required to know. Come to the edge of
  the wood. There is one thing more which I have to say to you. Come to the
  entrance of the wood there, and stand by my side."</p>

  <p>Sinclair staggered up, a weak, broken-spirited creature of a man; he was
  bent almost double, and he reached scarcely to the other's shoulder.
  Mannister showed no signs of fatigue. His white linen riding suit was
  unsoiled, his tie and collar immaculate. His hands, though brown, were
  unblistered, and his nails well cared for. He might very well have been
  riding through the hills on a Simla picnic. If he had suffered through that
  tireless chase, his hard bronzed face showed little signs of it. Compared
  with him, the creature by his side was negligible.</p>

  <p>His left hand he laid upon Sinclair's drooping shoulder, with his right
  forefinger he pointed to where they had left the woman. A covered wagon was
  there now, and a fire smoking. The woman herself was just visible, reclining
  in a camp chair. Mannister's voice was slower and more deliberate.</p>

  <p>"Sinclair," he said, "you see there your life. You have done me, as a man,
  the greatest injury which one man has learnt in nineteen hundred years to
  inflict upon another. In leaving you alive upon the earth, I make no pretence
  at forgiving you. To kick you into eternity would be, however, only the
  caprice of a child. The vengeance of God and man strikes deeper. The woman is
  yours by right of theft. I leave you together, and I leave you the care of
  her a charge upon your life. Only remember that my arm is long, and as you
  deal with her, so shall you be dealt with by me."</p>

  <p>"She loves me no more! She is weary already!" the man muttered. "There is
  no path in life which we could tread together."</p>

  <p>"Too late," Mannister answered. "You must hew one axe in hand, even if it
  be through the wilderness. And for the rest, the love of a woman is to be won
  by the man on whom she leans. You must win hers, Sinclair. You played the
  lover well enough, no doubt, when you took her from my home. See that you
  play it again, and to good purpose."</p>

  <p>"I lied to her! I worked upon her jealousy!" Sinclair muttered.</p>

  <p>"My common sense has already assured me of that," Mannister answered,
  "else she would never have left me for you. Never mind. You must do your
  best. There is but one royal road through life for you&mdash;and along that
  road you must go hand in hand or alone to your grave. For the smaller
  matters, you will find that there is money enough in her name to keep you
  from starvation, and I shall require to hear of your marriage within two
  months. My divorce decree is before the courts."</p>

  <p>"She will not marry me," Sinclair said sullenly. "We do not speak. All day
  and night she weeps because of what she has done."</p>

  <p>"What you won once," Mannister said, "when surely everything was against
  you, you can win again now when she is alone in the world, and the poor
  remnants of her honour are in your keeping. At any rate you must try.
  Remember that it is for your life that you plead. Come."</p>

  <p>The two men approached the camp side by side, Mannister leading his horse
  by the bridle, tall, slim, debonair; Sinclair hobbling by his side, bent and
  broken, with dulled eyes and wandering footsteps. The woman leaned forward to
  watch them coming. Her lips were parted, a tinge of colour had come back to
  her cheeks. Her beautiful eyes were fastened upon Mannister&mdash;it seemed
  as though she were fighting with all there was of life left in her, to draw
  from his stony face one single sign of recognition. He came and went amongst
  his servants, giving brief orders; once he almost brushed her skirts, and
  passed by with blank, unseeing eyes. She did not exist for him! He did not
  speak to her! He could ignore her so completely&mdash;he could act as though
  she were already dead! Faster and faster came her breath, and whiter grew her
  lips. She loved him! She had known it in the long nights, she had felt it
  like a mortal pain piercing her burden of intolerable shame. Now he was
  coming nearer&mdash;he had passed. He was upon his horse&mdash;how well he
  always looked upon horseback, and her fingers were gripping the shoulder of
  the poor creature whom she loathed.</p>

  <p>"Remember," he said, looking downwards with a flash from his steely blue
  eyes. "Remember, Sinclair!"</p>

  <p>His horse plunged, and he was galloping away. She sprang to her
  feet&mdash;a cry of anguish broke at last from her dry lips.</p>

  <p>"He is coming back!" she shrieked. "Tell me that he is coming back!"</p>

  <p>"He is never coming back!" Sinclair said sullenly.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>She looked at him for one moment, and her heart sickened with loathing.
  Away along the level road the figure of the retreating horseman grew smaller
  and smaller. She tottered, and fell forward upon her face. Sinclair sat still
  and understood why he was alive.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-02"
     id="ch-02"></a>II. TRASKE AND THE BRACELET</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Cosmopolitan</i>, Nov 1907</h3>

  <p class="first">GLITTER of glass and perfume of flowers, the music of
  women's laughter, the sparkle of jewels upon white bosoms, all the nameless
  air of content and wellbeing which pervades such a restaurant as Luigi's
  during the holy hour of all Englishmen&mdash;the hour when he dines. The
  little orchestra, whose soft restrained playing was one of the charms of the
  place, had just finished the "Salut D'Amour." Smoothly shining heads were
  bent towards more elaborate coiffures; whispers and smiles and glances, lit
  with meaning, flashed backwards and forwards between the occupants of the
  small tables. Dark visaged <i>ma&icirc;tres d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, deft and eager, watched
  the scene with interest. At one table only, a large round one near the door,
  were there any signs of dissatisfaction.</p>

  <p>The table was laid for four, and there were but three men present. They
  represented the obvious attitude of waiting for the tardy guest. The eldest
  of the party, bald-headed, with gold-rimmed spectacles, pink cheeks, and
  smooth-shaven face, looked continually at his watch and bent forward to see
  every new arrival. The other two men were talking to one another in earnest
  whispers.</p>

  <p>Luigi himself came up to the table, and bowed to his customers with all
  the ease of a long acquaintance.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Polsover is later this evening, gentlemen," he remarked. "You think
  that he will come, eh? You see it is half-past eight, and the dinner was
  ordered for eight o'clock punctual."</p>

  <p>"I'm hanged if we'll wait any longer, Luigi," declared the man with the
  gold-rimmed glasses. "Tell them to serve up dinner. By-the-bye, have either
  of you fellows seen Polsover to-day?"</p>

  <p>"I saw him only an hour or so ago," Traske declared&mdash;Traske, the
  junior of the party, in white waistcoat and tie of the latest pattern, sleek,
  well groomed, immaculate, after the amazing fashion of the struggling
  stockbroker. "He was in at Poole's trying a coat on, and we walked down the
  arcade."</p>

  <p>"Say anything about to-night?" the other asked.</p>

  <p>"Only that we should meet again later. By Jove, here he is! Polsover, you
  blackguard! Do you know the time?"</p>

  <p>They all turn towards him with a little chorus of protests and questions.
  And then as suddenly there was silence. The new arrival, tall, slim, and
  darker than the average Englishman, was slowly unwinding his scarf and
  passing his hat to the attendant.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the three men were fastened upon his face. Traske passed a
  cocktail across the table.</p>

  <p>"Have a drink, old chap," he said.</p>

  <p>Polsover took the glass, and held it with difficulty to lips almost as
  pale as the white kid gloves which as yet he had not removed. He drained it,
  and set it down empty. Then he took his place at the table. The silence was
  strained and unnatural.</p>

  <p>Waiters and <i>ma&icirc;tres d'h&ocirc;tel</i> melted away for a moment. Traske leaned
  across the table. His voice was lowered almost to a whisper&mdash;a whisper
  which, notwithstanding all his efforts, was hoarse and shaky. The words came
  out with a jerk&mdash;harsh, staccato.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong, Polsover?"</p>

  <p>Polsover glanced around half fearfully. His face was still the colour of
  chalk. He leaned across the table, and the heads of the four men were close
  together.</p>

  <p>"Mannister is in London," he whispered. "I have seen him. I believe that
  he is coming here."</p>

  <p>Something unique in the way of oaths broke from the lips of the man in the
  gold-rimmed spectacles, who presided over the little gathering. The other two
  simply stared. It was incredible, astounding! They neglected for the first
  few moments even to ask him the obvious questions. Then the coming of a
  waiter imposed upon them the ghastly necessity of concealing their terror.
  Conversation of some sort was necessary. Polsover spoke of wine, and ordered
  the magnum which stood in the ice pail by their side to be immediately
  opened. Never were glasses raised to the lips and drained more eagerly.
  Polsover, who had had time to realize this thing, was now the most
  self-possessed of the party.</p>

  <p>"I went into the bar at the <i>Savoy</i>," he explained, "to have a
  Dubonnet before coming across. He was there, in travelling clothes, just
  arrived I should think. I nearly went through the floor."</p>

  <p>"What did he say? Did he speak to you?" Traske asked.</p>

  <p>"Just as though we had parted yesterday," Polsover declared. "I&mdash;I
  had a drink with him."</p>

  <p>The thing was driven home to them now beyond a doubt. Polsover had stood
  before the bar and drank with him. No one could do that with a ghost.</p>

  <p>"He asked&mdash;after everybody," Polsover continued, "just as though he
  had been away for a week-end. He said&mdash;when he had changed&mdash;that he
  was coming here."</p>

  <p>Hambledon drank his third glass of champagne, and made a brave attempt to
  break through the stupefaction which seemed to have clouded the intellects of
  all of them. Hambledon was the man in the gold-rimmed spectacles, who seemed
  to play the host.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "we're not a pack of babies, to be scared to death
  just because one man's come back from the dead. Mannister can't eat us. We've
  played it low down against him, but we're inside the law. He can't know much.
  If Sinclair and he have ever come face to face, there would be more shooting
  than talking done. I doubt if he knows anything. Remember&mdash;if he comes
  he is welcome. Not too much surprise, mind&mdash;and no explanations
  tonight."</p>

  <p>"About the time?" Traske asked hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Silence!" Hambledon declared.</p>

  <p>Then they heard Luigi's little cry of surprise merged into one of welcome,
  and the thunderbolt fell. Tall and lean, with bronzed face and clear,
  sunburnt skin, Mannister, in his trim evening clothes, and unchanging air of
  complete self-composure, seemed, as he slowly advanced towards them, a
  perfectly natural part of the place and its surroundings. Only these four men
  who had known him intimately could detect some slight but significant change
  in the expression of the man who came so calmly forward to greet them.</p>

  <p>"Mannister, by all that's wonderful!" Hambledon exclaimed, rising and
  holding out both his hands.</p>

  <p>"Mannister!" the others echoed, and rose to their feet.</p>

  <p>There was a moment's pause of breathless expectancy. They felt that the
  next few seconds would decide the momentous question as to whether this man
  had come as friend or enemy. He himself seemed for some reason inclined to
  prolong the period of uncertainty. He stood quite still for an appreciable
  space of time, looking at the four men who had risen to their feet prepared
  to receive him with every appearance of good fellowship, and yet,
  notwithstanding all their efforts, showing something of the nervousness which
  they all felt, in their faces and manners. With a little laugh, Mannister
  threw his coat to the cloak-room attendant who had followed him in, and
  leisurely drawing off his gloves, extended his hand to Hambledon.</p>

  <p>"Can you make room for an unexpected visitor?" he asked. "It's like old
  times to see a magnum of Pomeroy. Hambledon, you haven't changed a bit.
  Traske, you are looking fit as ever. Jacobs, how are you? Where are you all
  with your dinner? I'll chip in if I may."</p>

  <p>The key-note of their conversation was struck. Their welcome was more than
  effusive, it was almost uproarious. His glass was filled, and a place was
  hastily laid for him. There was no lack of conversation. He had been away for
  more than a year. There were a hundred people to ask after, endless little
  pieces of news and gossip to retail to him. But the greater things they left
  alone. No mention was made of the reason of his sudden disappearance from the
  country, or of the man in search of whom he had gone. Nor did they speak of
  certain transactions which had taken place during his absence, but for which
  they knew very well that a day of reckoning must come. There were certain
  names, too, which Mannister left alone until dinner was almost over. Then he
  asked after them, one by one, and it seemed to the four men who answered,
  that there was something sinister in these inquiries, apparently so casual,
  and yet embracing just those men and no others.</p>

  <p>"Colin Stevens is not here to-night, I see," Mannister began.</p>

  <p>"He is over in Paris for a few days," Hambledon answered.</p>

  <p>Mannister nodded.</p>

  <p>"And Rundermere, Phil Rundermere?"</p>

  <p>"Phil's about as usual," Hambledon answered, "but a little down on his
  luck. He's had a very bad season's racing."</p>

  <p>"John Dykes?"</p>

  <p>"He may be in any moment," Traske declared, a little uneasily. "He doesn't
  often dine with us. He's had gout badly, and he's trying a diet cure."</p>

  <p>Hambledon drank a glass of wine during the momentary silence which
  followed. He felt the perspiration breaking out upon his forehead. These
  names and no others! There must be a purpose in it. Seven of the eight,
  including those who were present, had already been inquired for. There was
  only one left. If he should ask for her and no one else, they would know that
  it was war. They would know that their danger was no fancied one.</p>

  <p>"And last, but not least," Mannister asked, looking intently into the
  contents of his glass, "la belle Sophy, Mrs. De la Mere, unless she has
  changed her name?"</p>

  <p>"She is dining here to-night," Hambledon answered. "She is sitting
  immediately behind you."</p>

  <p>Mannister smiled.</p>

  <p>"Presently," he said, "I must pay my respects to her. It is very
  interesting to hear about so many old friends."</p>

  <p>Then he was silent for several moments, still apparently watching the
  bubbles rise in his champagne glass, and the four men stole glances one at
  the other. He had asked after them all, all the eight! They could not doubt
  any longer but that it was war!</p>

  <p>Coffee and liqueurs were set before them. Already half the diners in the
  place had left. Mannister glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"Half-past nine," he said. "Remember that I have been away from London a
  year. What does one do now? Have we any?"</p>

  <p>He glanced meaningly at Hambledon, who shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, no!" he said. "There is nothing of that sort on just now. We might go
  to a music-hall for an hour, and round to Cumberland Mansions afterwards, all
  of us except Ben, that is. Ben is a reformed character. In fact this is
  something in the way of a farewell dinner. Ben is going to be married next
  month to somebody very young and very rich."</p>

  <p>Traske was obviously annoyed.</p>

  <p>"Don't listen to Hambledon's rot," he said, "but that reminds me. I must
  be off."</p>

  <p>Mannister stretched out a detaining hand.</p>

  <p>"Don't hurry," he said. "Remember that your old friends too have claims.
  By-the-bye, what about Sophy de la Mere?"</p>

  <p>Traske was uncomfortable, and showed it. Such questioning from any one
  else he would have resented at once.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Sophy's all right," he declared. "Not likely to round upon an old
  pal." Sophy herself appeared, radiant in white lace, a picture hat, and a
  feather boa. She, perhaps, more than any of them, had suffered from nerves
  when first she had seen Mannister enter the restaurant, but she had had time
  to get over it, and she was a woman. So she came up to him with outstretched
  hands and a brilliant smile. It was simpler to treat his absence as something
  quite ordinary, to ignore those things concerning which speech was
  difficult.</p>

  <p>"Back again to Babylon, my friend," she said, lightly. "Welcome home! I am
  delighted to see you."</p>

  <p>Mannister stood and smiled down upon her, his hand resting on the back of
  his chair.</p>

  <p>"I see that your friends," he remarked, "have dispersed. Won't you sit
  down and have some coffee with us? It will be quite like old times."</p>

  <p>"On one condition," she answered, "and that is that you all come round to
  my rooms afterwards. Dicky is going to South Africa to-morrow, and we are
  going to give him a send-off, music and bridge and a riotous time generally.
  You'll all come, won't you? If you say yes I'll sit down, and we can all go
  back together."</p>

  <p>"I shall be charmed," Mannister answered. "I do not think that any of us
  could refuse such an invitation."</p>

  <p>His glance rested as though by accident upon Traske, who was suddenly
  conscious of a feeling of apprehension for which he could not account.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, rising, "that I shall have to be excused. I was
  just explaining to Mannister here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You will not be excused," Mrs. De la Mere said quietly. "You are coming,
  Ben. I insist upon it."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. No one else intervened. They recognized that
  the disposal of Traske's evening had suddenly become a matter of some
  import.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," Traske began, but without any conviction in his tone, "but I
  really have an important engagement this evening. If to-morrow evening
  or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No other evening will do," Mrs. De la Mere said. "I am thinking of
  leaving town myself almost directly, so this may very well be a farewell
  party in more senses than one. You must come, Ben."</p>

  <p>Traske resumed his seat, but his face was troubled. Hambledon whispered in
  Mannister's ear.</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary thing about Ben. He made up to a little girl somewhere in
  the suburbs just because she had a lot of money, and upon my word I believe
  it's coming off. Talks of chucking the city and town life, and going to live
  in the country."</p>

  <p>"Is he honest, do you suppose?" Mannister asked.</p>

  <p>Hambledon smiled&mdash;an unpleasant smile his.</p>

  <p>"Until he gets hold of the money. He's got round the girl somehow or
  other, I suppose. She's very pretty and very pious, and that's all we know
  about her. He's taken good care to keep her away from all of us?"</p>

  <p>Mannister leaned back in his chair and smiled to himself thoughtfully. He
  glanced across at Traske, and the smile deepened, although there was little
  of mirth in it.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>In the vestibule of the restaurant, Sophy de la Mere drew Mannister on one
  side.</p>

  <p>"I want you to drive home with me," she said. "The others can follow in
  hansoms."</p>

  <p>Mannister bowed.</p>

  <p>"I shall be charmed, of course," he said, and followed her across the
  pavement into the little electric coup&eacute;. She raised her 'veil as they swung
  off, and he looked at her critically. She had certainly aged, and there was
  more powder upon her cheeks than she had used a year ago.</p>

  <p>"Look here," she said, "I know very well that your coming back means no
  good to any of us. I watched you come and I watched the others' faces. They
  are scared out of their lives, but I don't suppose they have had the pluck to
  talk to you as I mean to. We served you a low-down miserable trick, a trick
  that no man is likely to forgive. We gambled upon your never being able to
  show yourself in England again, and you see we lost. Don't think I am going
  to cry off for my share. I know very well you're not the forgiving sort."</p>

  <p>Mannister looked at her curiously.</p>

  <p>"If one might venture to inquire&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Don't interrupt me," she continued. "We have only a few minutes, and I
  want to make the most of them. You're back here to get level with all of us,
  and I have a sort of an idea that you'll do it. You can't collect our heads
  or reputations, or whatever you mean to strike at, into one, and destroy them
  at one blow. You'll have to take us separately. Have you any choice as to the
  order?"</p>

  <p>Mannister began to understand. He thrust his hand into his breast coat
  pocket, and drew from a small pocket-book a folded strip of paper. He spread
  it open upon his knee, and moved a little so that the electric light at the
  back of the coup&eacute; fell upon it.</p>

  <p>"You see here," he remarked, "a list of eight names. They are in order,
  not alphabetically, as you will observe. You see who heads the list."</p>

  <p>"She peered forward.</p>

  <p>"Benjamin Traske!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>He nodded, and replaced the paper in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Are you not curious," he asked, "to see where yours comes?"</p>

  <p>"Not I," she answered quickly. "When my turn comes I shall be ready.
  Listen. I am not offering to make a bargain with you. I want no mercy for
  what I did. If my name stands second upon that list, I am ready even now to
  tell you to do your worst. But of my own free will I offer you this." She
  touched with her slim forefinger the place where that paper had been. "I will
  help you with that first name."</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"So you do not like the idea," he remarked, "of our friend Benjamin's
  marriage?"</p>

  <p>"I do not," she answered. "To tell you the truth I do not mean that
  marriage to take place."</p>

  <p>"You would prefer," he suggested softly, "that our young friend should
  find himself involved, perhaps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind that," she interrupted. "I have a scheme. I only ask you when
  the time comes to play up to me. The girl he is engaged to is a little
  Puritan and a fool. I do not wish to see her miserable for life. When she
  understands what sort of a man Benjamin Traske really is, she will never look
  at him again."</p>

  <p>Mannister nodded.</p>

  <p>"I will be ready," he answered. "When do you suppose this opportunity will
  come?"</p>

  <p>"To-night!" she whispered in his ear. "You will understand presently."</p>

  <p>The coup&eacute; had drawn up before the block of flats in which she lived.
  Mannister helped his companion to alight, and as they passed into the
  building, the other hansoms turned into the Square. Traske, who was the last
  to descend, stood for a moment upon the pavement, looking across the Square
  to where the wind was moving softly in the tops of the blossoming lime trees.
  A faint breath of their perfume reached him where he stood, and brought with
  it sudden swift thoughts of a garden not so very far away, a quaint,
  old-fashioned, walled garden, full of sweet smelling flowers, shadowy
  corners, and seats in unexpected places. Even now she would be walking there
  waiting for him. A sudden passionate distaste for the sort of evening which
  lay before him checked his footsteps even as he turned away. He could see it
  all through those dark curtained windows; the little rooms, over-scented,
  over-hot; the soft, sense-stirring music; the dancing, not quite such as one
  would see in a ballroom; the champagne, the flushed faces, the sense of
  subtle excitement, unwholesome, ignoble. It was the first time he had felt
  any such revulsion, and he knew very well that it was only a temporary one.
  These had been his pleasures, this the manner of his life. He had looked for
  nothing better, desired nothing better. He had lived all his days as one of
  the herd, and he knew it. To-night he was suddenly conscious of a hopeless,
  passionate desire to get away. Almost he fancied that he could hear the
  girl's voice calling to him softly, calling him away for ever from all the
  things that lay across the threshold of Mrs. De la Mere's flat. He turned
  abruptly round. In a moment he would have crossed the Square. Suddenly a hand
  fell upon his shoulder. He turned round to find Mannister there.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," Mannister said, "they're all in the lift waiting for
  you. What are you doing moon-gazing out here?"</p>

  <p>"I have a headache," Traske answered. "I am going home."</p>

  <p>Mannister's hand tightened on his shoulder like a vise.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "I think not! You are coming with me."<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Inside, the evening passed very much as many an evening before had passed.
  A little orchestra was tucked away in the corner of the larger of Mrs. De la
  Mere's sitting-rooms. Furniture was pushed back. They danced when they felt
  inclined, they sat about and talked. On the sideboard in the smaller room
  were many bottles of champagne, which, however, grew steadily less. Several
  young ladies connected with the theatrical profession had been summoned from
  their rooms, and other friends whom Mrs. De la Mere had invited kept coming
  and going. Traske, after an hour or so of weariness, gave in. Mrs. De la Mere
  herself took him into the smaller room, and made him open champagne for her.
  When he came back to dance his face was flushed, and his whole manner
  changed. He had forgotten all about the garden in the suburbs, and those
  other things which had troubled him for a moment. At thirty-five it is hard
  to reform. So the music went faster. A young lady, amidst uproarious
  applause, danced a "Pas Seul," and it was Traske who took her out afterwards
  and opened champagne for her. The air was blue with cigarette smoke, faces
  were flushed and hot, voices not altogether steady. Only two people remained
  unchanged, and they were Mannister and Mrs. De la Mere. Dicky, in whose
  honour the feast was given, sat upon the table which had been pushed into a
  corner of the room, with a bottle of champagne in one hand and a glass in the
  other.</p>

  <p>"We'll lock the doors," he declared. "We won't let a soul out till eight
  o'clock, and then we'll all go round to breakfast at my place."</p>

  <p>"You can stay as late as you like," Mrs. De la Mere answered, "but the
  band must go at three. They don's allow music afterwards."</p>

  <p>"We will dance in the street," Dicky declared. "Remember it's my last
  night in England."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, presently a few people began to slip away. Traske, who had
  been left alone for a minute, moved suddenly to the window of the smaller
  room, which chanced to be empty, and throwing it open, leaned out. A rush of
  night air upon his face, cool, delicious, brought to his uncertain brain some
  glimmering apprehension of those other things, the memory of which had
  troubled him once before. He moved resolutely to a corner, took up his
  overcoat and hat, and had reached the door before a shout assailed him. It
  was Hambledon who had suddenly called attention to his going, and the others
  all streamed through the door way.</p>

  <p>"You sneak, Ben!" Mrs. De la Mere cried, "trying to steal away without
  even saying good night to your hostess! I'm ashamed of you. Come back at
  once, sir, and take off that coat."</p>

  <p>Traske looked as though he had been surprised in something worse than a
  mere attempt to make his escape from a scene of which he had suddenly tired.
  His face was flushed, and he looked confused. He muttered something about the
  rooms being hot and having a headache, and he still tried to go. Mannister
  laid his hand upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"We can't spare you, Traske," he said; "positively we can't spare you yet.
  Do you mean to say that you were going without even wishing your hostess good
  night?"</p>

  <p>There was no opportunity for Traske to reply, there was no opportunity
  just then for any one else in the room to say a word. From the other room
  came Miss Bella Delmain, a burning spot of colour in her cheeks, her eyes lit
  with anger, her voice shrill with passion.</p>

  <p>"My bracelet!" she cried. "I took it off only ten minutes ago, and it has
  gone. Don't let any one leave the room. Lock the doors, please, until my
  bracelet is found."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De la Mere turned quickly round.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean your diamond bracelet, Bella!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I do!" was the excited response. "It cost five hundred pounds. It was
  given me by&mdash;never mind. It was my diamond bracelet, I tell you. Some
  one has taken it, some one who is in the room now. If this is a joke, for
  Heaven's sake drop it. I want my bracelet back. Do you hear, all of you? Who
  has it?"</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence. The musicians had left off playing. Every one
  was drawing toward the little group of which Bella Delmain was the centre.
  Mannister intervened.</p>

  <p>"Where did you leave the bracelet?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"On the piano, not ten minutes ago," was the quick reply.</p>

  <p>"It may have slipped down," some one suggested, and a search was made.
  They moved the piano, they shook the music books, they went on hands and
  knees upon the carpet, but there was no bracelet anywhere near the spot where
  it had been left. Mannister spoke again, and this time his voice was
  graver.</p>

  <p>"This is a very unpleasant thing," he said. "With your permission, Mrs. De
  la Mere, we will lock the doors."</p>

  <p>Traske objected vigorously.</p>

  <p>"Such rot!" he exclaimed. "The girl will find the bracelet in a moment or
  two, probably upon her arm. I want to go. Do you hear, Mannister?"</p>

  <p>Mannister eyed him coldly.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, "that you will have to curb your impatience.
  Ladies and gentlemen," he added, turning back into the room, "this is a most
  unpleasant affair, and there is only one way out of it. First of all we must
  search the room, and then we must search one another."</p>

  <p>Traske, who was more than half drunk, shook the handle of the door with
  his hand.</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" he exclaimed. "I won't be searched, and I won't stop here while
  you go through such an absurd performance. Do you hear, I want to go
  home."</p>

  <p>Mannister turned towards him, smiling, and at that moment Traske felt the
  blood run cold in his veins. There was something in Mannister's face which he
  did not understand, something which seemed ominous in the faint, complacent
  smile with which he was regarded. Vaguely he felt that he was in some sort of
  danger, that he was trapped, and that Mannister knew all about it, and he
  lost for a moment control of himself.</p>

  <p>"Give me the key, d&mdash;n you, Mannister!" he cried. "I am not going to
  stay for this buffoonery."</p>

  <p>Mannister caught him by the shoulders and addressed him with mock
  gravity.</p>

  <p>"My young friend," he said, "you will excuse me, but you will certainly
  not leave here until you have undergone the same search as we others are
  willing to submit to. As you are in so great a hurry, however, and as you
  were on the point of bidding us a somewhat unceremonious farewell, we will
  consult your convenience by searching you first."</p>

  <p>Then Traske knew what was coming, and his knees shook and his cheeks were
  ashen pale. He was not even surprised when the bracelet was drawn from his
  breast pocket. He looked wildly around and saw the same thing in every
  face.</p>

  <p>"I never took it!" he cried. "My overcoat was on the floor, and some one
  must have put the bracelet there. Sophy, Mannister, Hambledon, you don't
  really believe that I stole it!"</p>

  <p>But there was no reply from any one of the three. Only Mrs. De la Mere
  crossed the room swiftly, and stooping down pressed the electric bell.</p>

  <p><a id="pic3"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>"What is that for?" Traske cried. "What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. De la Mere faced him coldly.</p>

  <p>"I can stand a great deal," she said, "from those who have been my
  friends, but such a theft as this, in my own rooms, passes even my
  forgiveness. John," she added, turning to the night porter who had answered
  the bell, "I want you to call up a policeman, please."</p>

  <p>Traske raved, and struggled to escape, but Mannister's hand was like a
  vise upon his shoulder. The musicians and the few remaining guests hurried
  away by the other door. When the policeman arrived, only Bella Delmain, Mrs.
  De la Mere, Mannister, and Traske himself, were left. Traske fell on his
  knees.</p>

  <p>"You are not going to charge me with this," he cried. "You know very well
  that it will ruin me."</p>

  <p>Mannister smiled. Already they could hear the heavy footsteps ascending
  the stairs.</p>

  <p>"It may ruin you," he said, "but it will at least save that unfortunate
  young woman whom you were talking of marrying, from making a fatal
  mistake."</p>

  <p>Traske understood then, and his face was white with despair.</p>

  <p>"You are going through with this?" he gasped. "You are going to have me
  convicted?"</p>

  <p>Mannister shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily," he said. "The evidence will probably be insufficient.
  But before the magistrates you certainly will go, and every one who pays a
  penny for a newspaper to-morrow will know how you spent the evening."<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Curiously enough, Mannister's words were prophetic. Traske was somewhat
  reluctantly discharged in the morning by a magistrate who obviously believed
  in his guilt. The young lady in the garden was hurried off to Switzerland by
  her aunt, and Mannister, taking a sheet of paper from his pocket,
  deliberately ruled a firm thick line through the first name.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-03"
     id="ch-03"></a>III. THE ATRUSCAN SILVER MINE</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Cosmopolitan</i>, Dec 1907</h3>

  <p class="first">HAMBLEDON and Polsover were walking arm in arm down the
  Strand.</p>

  <p>Their propinquity was not so much a matter of affection as of a mutual
  desire that their conversation should be unheard by passers-by.</p>

  <p>"I tell you, Hambledon," Polsover was saying, "I don't like the idea of
  having Mannister in this at all. In fact I don't like being in anything with
  Mannister."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Hambledon asked. Polsover looked round as though even then he
  were afraid of being overheard.</p>

  <p>"I don't trust him, Freddy," he said, under his breath.</p>

  <p>"That's all very well," Hambledon objected, "but he's putting up his own
  money, and if he upsets the apple-cart, he stands to lose as much as any of
  us."</p>

  <p>Polsover nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's reasonable enough," he said, "but, Freddy, I've always wanted to
  ask you. What did you think about that Traske affair?"</p>

  <p>Hambledon took the cigar from his mouth for a moment and looked at it
  reflectively.</p>

  <p>"Pol," he said, "I'll tell you something. Ben was on his last legs, hadn't
  money enough to buy a wedding ring, much more pay for a honeymoon. He was
  simply mad to get hold of the girl. He'd been to me twice that day, but I
  hadn't a tenner to spare. As a matter of fact you know what low water we've
  all been in. There was not a fifty pound note amongst us."</p>

  <p>"You think, then," Polsover asked, "that he took the bracelet?"</p>

  <p>"I do," Hambledon answered, "and if it hadn't been for Sophy De la Mere
  throttling the evidence, he'd have gone to prison for it. Didn't you think
  so?"</p>

  <p>"I was not sure," Polsover answered thoughtfully. "Somehow or other I
  found myself wondering whether Mannister had anything to do with it."</p>

  <p>"What, with stealing the bracelet do you mean?" Hambledon asked.</p>

  <p>"No, but with playing a little trick upon Traske! Mannister seems to have
  forgiven us in a way, but I tell you, Freddy, I can't trust him. I wish to
  Heaven he'd never come back, or that having come back, he'd have gone for us
  like a bull in a china shop. I don't understand the quiet way he took things.
  We robbed him, Freddy."</p>

  <p>Hambledon shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"True enough," he answered, "but Mannister's no fool. He'd have done the
  same in our place, and he doesn't know that we worked it with Sinclair to
  bolt with a certain lady. I grant you he'd never forgive that, and if I
  thought he knew it I'd go in fear and trembling. But he don't. It's simply
  the money, and I don't believe he's the sort to be vindictive about
  that."</p>

  <p>"You may be right," Polsover said. "I hope you are. I can't help wishing,
  though, that Mannister had never come back. I have an idea that we shall
  suffer for it. We've lost Traske already, gone to Canada. If any more
  misfortunes come, I tell you I shall step outside while he's round."</p>

  <p>They turned into a side street, and pushing open a swing door a little way
  down, entered the private bar of a small hotel. Jacobs was sitting there,
  awaiting them.</p>

  <p>"Jolly late, you chaps!" he grumbled. "I've been hanging about for half an
  hour."</p>

  <p>They ordered something to drink, and Jacobs leaned forward
  confidentially.</p>

  <p>"I tell you," he said, "Mannister has got the part to perfection. When you
  chaps hear him you'll want to put every copper you've got yourselves into the
  great Atruscan mine."</p>

  <p>"The question is," Polsover remarked, "whether our friend, Mr. Harold
  Cuthbertson, will be similarly impressed."</p>

  <p>"You leave that to me," Jacobs replied. "What I want to know is, have you
  fellows had any luck?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit!" Hambledon declared. "None at all," Polsover said.</p>

  <p>Jacobs set down his glass disconsolately.</p>

  <p>"Then I do not see," he declared, "what we can do. Mannister will put up
  his lot, but only if we put up a similar amount. That's fair enough, for it
  takes a bit of pluck to put thousands of pounds into shares that aren't worth
  a snap of the fingers. Do you mean to say you fellows can do nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely nothing!" Polsover declared, disconsolately.</p>

  <p>Jacobs opened his mouth, as though he had a suggestion to make. Then
  apparently he changed his mind, and glanced toward the clock.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "we may be able to think of something. At any rate,
  Cuthbertson has asked us all to luncheon at the <i>Savoy</i> to-day at 1-30,
  and Mannister's going to tell him about the mine. It's worth coming to,
  whether we can work the thing or not. Let's go round there."</p>

  <p>"I suppose we may as well," Hambledon said slowly, finishing his drink,
  and arranging his tie in front of the mirror. "If we can't work this little
  affair, our friend Cuthbertson should turn out to be a profitable
  acquaintance in some way or another. A young man with a hundred thousand
  pounds coming to him in about three weeks time, should be worth
  cultivating."</p>

  <p>"Or in other words, plucking," Polsover remarked drily, as they left the
  place.</p>

  <p>The luncheon party at the <i>Savoy</i> was certainly, so far as its
  immediate object went, a great success. Cuthbertson, a dissolute young boy
  within a few weeks of his majority, whose only guardians were a firm of
  lawyers, was the host, and Mannister sat at his right hand. On his left was
  Jacobs, who had found him in Paris. Polsover and Hambledon completed the
  little party. They were all men, with the exception of Cuthbertson himself,
  of a certain amount of presence, assisted perhaps a little too liberally by
  judicious tailoring. Mannister, however, with his bronzed face and
  unostentatious blue serge clothes, seemed somehow of a different order. The
  boy at the head of the table listened to every word he said eagerly. For the
  first part of luncheon no mention was made of business, but with the arrival
  of the champagne, Hambledon lifted his glass.</p>

  <p>"We must drink Mannister's health," he said, "and may he often come back
  from expeditions as satisfactory as this one. I only wish," he continued,
  "that it was as easy to make hundreds every day as he has made it possible
  for us to make thousands."</p>

  <p>Mannister bowed ironically. The eyes of the boy by his side were fixed
  upon him eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I say, Mr. Mannister," he began, in an undertone, "about this mine."</p>

  <p>"What about it?" Mannister asked.</p>

  <p>"When are you going to take your report in to the office?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow afternoon," Mannister answered. "No one paid me for going out,
  so I feel at liberty to do exactly as I please. That is why I am giving a few
  of my friends time to book up some of the shares before I disclose the
  truth."</p>

  <p>"I suppose they'll go up a lot," Cuthbertson remarked.</p>

  <p>Jacobs leaned across the table.</p>

  <p>"To-day," he said, "the five pound shares can be bought for three pounds
  ten. The day after to-morrow they will stand at anything between fifteen and
  twenty pounds."</p>

  <p>The boy's eyes glistened. They were not pleasant eyes, for young though he
  was, they were already dull and heavy looking. The light that shone in them
  was more the light of greed.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't I," he demanded, "buy some?"</p>

  <p>Jacobs shook his head. Hambledon began to talk to Polsover about something
  else, as though the subject scarcely interested him.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Jacobs said thoughtfully. "Between us we've scooped up
  nearly half of them. There are some more, of course, to be had, but it would
  mean cash down, and you might find that a little difficult, perhaps."</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it," Cuthbertson answered eagerly. "I know a money-lender
  who'd let me have twenty or thirty thousand tomorrow. You see I'm of age in
  three weeks, and he knows the money's waiting for me."</p>

  <p>"It seems scarcely worth while," Mannister said with a yawn, "for you to
  come into the money-making market. You'll have plenty in a few weeks."</p>

  <p>"One can't have too much," Cuthbertson answered, with a smile. "Of course,
  I'm coming in for a nice little pile, but nowadays it's pretty easy to get
  rid of it. I want to have a yacht if I can afford it, and I'll take all you
  fellows down the Mediterranean. About these shares, Jacobs. How many do you
  think you could get for me?"</p>

  <p>"I have no idea whether I could get any," Jacobs answered. "How much money
  could you raise?"</p>

  <p>"About thirty thousand," Cuthbertson answered.</p>

  <p>"About's no good," Jacobs answered. "You'd better see your friend this
  afternoon, get to know exactly what you can raise, and how many of the shares
  you would like, and come down to my office and let me know. Meantime I'll go
  round the city and see what can be done. But&mdash;you'll forgive me,
  Cuthbertson, I know," he added, leaning across the table, "it's a lot of
  money for you to make without any risk, and my time is worth something. I'd
  like to do this for you as a pal, but as you will be making something like a
  hundred thousand pounds out of it, I shall have to charge you my usual
  broker's commission. You won't mind that?"</p>

  <p>The boy laughed carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Not likely," he answered. "I don't want you to do it for nothing. I'll go
  and see old Lewis directly after luncheon. A hundred thousand pounds! Jove!
  I'll have the yacht after all! Waiter, pass the wine round, and get another
  magnum. Mannister, you are taking nothing."</p>

  <p>Mannister smiled.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," he said, "I never drink champagne in the middle of the day.
  I'm only taking one glass out of compliment to you and a somewhat important
  occasion."</p>

  <p>Luncheon after that was not unduly protracted. Before half past three
  Cuthbertson had hurried off to see his friend. The four men walked together
  into the bar smoking-room. They stood by the window looking down on the
  Embankment, out of earshot of any one else in the place.</p>

  <p>"He'll get the money for certain," Jacobs said. "All that we need is to
  raise five thousand pounds for a few hours to buy these rotten shares. How
  are we going to do it? I have not five pounds in the bank."</p>

  <p>Hambledon and Polsover shook their heads. Mannister shrugged his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible," he said quietly, "for me to raise a sixpence beyond
  what I have promised."</p>

  <p>It was Mannister upon whom they had been relying. Their faces fell.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," Mannister remarked, "that Polsover is the man to arrange
  this. You have plenty of money in the hands of your firm, I suppose," he
  continued, "for the purposes of investment. Why can't you draw a cheque on
  your client's account? You can cover it to-morrow, and the investment is
  surely good enough."</p>

  <p>Polsover shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I daren't," he said. "If my partners found out they'd chuck me to-morrow.
  Besides, it's fraud."</p>

  <p>Mannister laughed long and softly. He was leaning with his back against
  the wall and his arms folded, and there was something sinister about his
  mirth.</p>

  <p>"Really," he said, "you fellows sometimes are funny. However, if the money
  can't be raised, the scheme is off, that's all. If I'd known there was going
  to be this difficulty, I might have spared my posing. To think that I've
  played the mining engineer for nothing!"</p>

  <p>"The money must be found," Hambledon declared firmly. "This is too good a
  chance to send begging."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll leave you fellows to discuss it," Mannister said, picking up
  his hat.</p>

  <p>Polsover laid his hand upon his arm.</p>

  <p>"Don't go for a few minutes," he said. "I must think this over. I suppose,
  after all, it is a justifiable investment, provided, of course, he can raise
  the money."</p>

  <p>Mannister shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You can place it beyond the limits of risk," he remarked. "First of all,
  wait till the boy comes back and shows you that he can raise the money. Then
  make him sign an agreement to buy the shares and pay for them to-morrow. And
  what on earth does it matter whose money you use to buy them with!"</p>

  <p>"That's common sense," Hambledon declared.</p>

  <p>"It sounds like it," Polsover admitted.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>At about eight o'clock that evening, Cuthbertson had just completed a very
  careful toilette. In other words, he had succeeded in transforming himself
  into as close an imitation as possible of the young men whom he had seen
  about at the restaurants and theatres. His servant announced a visitor, and
  Mannister was shown into his rooms.</p>

  <p>"I shan't detain you five minutes," the newcomer remarked, closing the
  door after him, "but I want you to spare me that if you will. It's rather an
  important matter."</p>

  <p>"No difficulty about the shares, I hope?" Cuthbertson asked anxiously. "I
  have just seen Polsover. He told me he had secured twelve thousand, and I
  have arranged to give him the money for them to-morrow morning.</p>

  <p>"It is about that," Mannister said, seating himself, "that I came to see
  you. You don't mind my smoking, do you?" he he added, producing a cigarette
  case. "Thanks! Nice rooms you've got here."</p>

  <p>"Aren't bad, are they," Cuthbertson said, "though I mean to do a good deal
  better when I come into my tin. I say, why won't you come and dine with me?"
  he added, a little eagerly. "We will go to Luigi's or wherever you like. I am
  all alone this evening."</p>

  <p>Mannister shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," he said, "I can't, and perhaps you would not care to ask me when
  I have finished what I am going to say to you."</p>

  <p>The boy looked at him anxiously.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Only this," Mannister answered. "You've been got hold of by a gang of
  sharks. Polsover is one, Jacobs is one, Hambledon is one, and I am another.
  The Atruscan shares which Polsover is proposing to sell you to-morrow at
  three pounds fifteen, he gave about ten shillings for, and if you try to sell
  them any time within the next few months, you probably won't be able to
  realize more than half-a-crown. See?"</p>

  <p>Cuthbertson dropped into the chair.</p>

  <p>"Why," he exclaimed, "I've signed a promise to take them over to-morrow at
  three pounds fifteen, thirty thousand pounds worth."</p>

  <p>"That is why I came to see you to-night," Mannister remarked. "You see, I
  am going back upon my pals. Never mind why. I have my own reasons. It may be
  out of consideration for you, or it may be for my private ends, but I give
  you my word of honour that the facts are as I tell them to you. Do you
  believe me?"</p>

  <p>Cuthbertson looked at him and groaned.</p>

  <p>"I do," he said, "but I've signed the paper."</p>

  <p>"You are a minor," Mannister said coolly, "and they can't make you take
  the shares over. Take my advice. Catch the nine o'clock Continental train to
  Paris and stay there for a week or so. The thing will have blown over then.
  Leave a note for Polsover, and tell him you have changed your mind. That is
  all that is necessary."</p>

  <p>"I'll do it," Cuthbertson declared, ringing the bell. "My fellow shall
  pack me some clothes at once. I say it's awfully good of you, Mr. Mannister,
  to help me out like this."</p>

  <p>"You forget," Mannister reminded him coldly, "that I was one of the gang,
  only you see it didn't suit me to carry the thing right through. I am not
  going to tell you even now that Atruscan shares are worthless. They may be a
  great deal higher next week, or even the week after, but I do tell you that
  Polsover believes them to be absolutely worthless, and the five pound shares
  which he is selling you at three pounds fifteen, he bought, as I told you, at
  an average price of ten shillings, and if he had had a little more time, he
  could probably have bought them at five. Of course, if you care to
  speculate&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't!" the boy interrupted sharply. "I am going to write a note to
  Polsover at once, and catch that train."</p>

  <p>Mannister nodded and strolled towards the door.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "that you will do well to take this as a warning. The
  world isn't full of casual acquaintances who are anxious to stuff money into
  the pockets of strangers. Good night!"<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Mannister was sitting at breakfast the next morning in his rooms at
  Germain Street. He had finished his coffee and was preparing to light a
  cigarette, when his servant knocked at the door and announced a visitor.</p>

  <p>"There is a gentleman of the name of Polsover here, sir," he announced.
  "He wishes to see you for a moment on urgent business. I told him that you
  did not care to be disturbed so early, but he seems very much upset."</p>

  <p>Mannister nodded, and looked back toward the paper which he was
  reading.</p>

  <p>"You can show him in, Morton," he said.</p>

  <p>Polsover, white and scared, appeared almost at once. He scarcely waited
  until the door was closed before he flung an open letter before
  Mannister.</p>

  <p>"Read that!" he exclaimed. "For God's sake read that!"</p>

  <p>Mannister laid down his paper with a little frown.</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"
     name="pic4"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

    <img src="1202951h-images/Mannister4.png"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>"I wish you would learn to cultivate a little more self-restraint, my
  young friend," he said. "Even the appearance of hurry at this hour of the
  morning disturbs my digestion."</p>

  <p>"D&mdash;n your digestion!" Polsover cried, holding down the letter with
  trembling forefinger. "Read it! See what a mess we are in!"</p>

  <p>Mannister adjusted his eyeglass and read the letter carefully. It
  consisted only of a few hasty lines, written in Cuthbertson's almost
  illegible scrawl.</p>

  <blockquote>
    "Dear Sir," it began, "I met a friend this evening who gave me a very bad
    account of the Atruscan mine, and it seems to me that you may have been
    mistaken in your estimate of the value of those shares. In any case, I have
    decided not to have anything to do with them, which kindly note. I am going
    away for a few days to-night, and hope you will not be put to any
    inconvenience in the matter. Yours faithfully, Harold Cuthbertson."
  </blockquote>

  <p>Mannister folded the letter up and handed it back to Polsover.</p>

  <p>"That's awkward," he remarked nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>"Awkward!" Polsover gasped. "Do you know that I have used six thousand
  pounds of the office money to buy those shares! That young blackguard swore
  that I should have the money by ten o'clock this morning."</p>

  <p>"You ought not to have lost sight of him," Mannister said calmly. "No
  doubt he's met some one who has given him an idea of the truth. The only
  thing you can do is to put them back upon the market this morning, and stand
  the loss."</p>

  <p>Polsover was shaking from head to foot. "Put them on the market!" he
  faltered. "Why, it would take days to sell them to realize any price at all,
  and even then the margin of loss would be far and away greater than any I
  could afford. I gave shillings a share more for some of the lots, because I
  wanted them quick, and I know very well there isn't a lot I bought I could
  get rid of again at anything like the price. If I can't replace the money I
  borrowed by eleven o'clock this morning, I'm done. Can you do anything,
  Mannister?"</p>

  <p>Mannister shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not I," he answered. "You ought to have some money between you. You've
  had some lucky hauls within the last few years."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. A swift suspicion flashed into Polsover's
  mind. He bent forward, looking into Mannister's face. Was this a trap into
  which he had fallen? But Mannister's expression told him nothing. Calm and as
  imperturbable as ever, his whole attention seemed to be absorbed in the
  selection of a fresh cigarette.</p>

  <p>"We had some good hauls," Polsover groaned, "but we had some thundering
  bad luck too. You can't help me, Mannister?"</p>

  <p>"I can't," Mannister answered. "The only thing I can do is this. If you
  see that you absolutely can't pull through, I'll give you a thousand pounds
  for the shares, and take my chance of getting rid of them some way or other.
  It will be enough to give you a fresh start abroad. You know very well that
  if you throw these shares on the market this morning, they won't fetch a
  shilling a piece."</p>

  <p>"How long shall you be here?" Polsover asked.</p>

  <p>"I'll stay in until eleven," Mannister answered, "and I'll send to the
  bank for the money."</p>

  <p>"If I can't pull through without, I'll be back," Polsover answered, taking
  up his hat.</p>

  <p>Mannister nodded, and returned to his newspaper.</p>

  <p>At twenty minutes to eleven Polsover was back again. He was wearing a long
  travelling coat and a pair of motor spectacles.</p>

  <p>"I'll take your thousand, Mannister," he said. "You were right. I can't
  realize a shilling on the shares, and I can't come anywhere near finding the
  money I borrowed. It will be all out in less than an hour. I am going to
  motor down to Southampton. You've got the money? Here are the shares."</p>

  <p>He threw some scrip on the table, and Mannister counted out Bank of
  England notes and gold, a thousand pounds.</p>

  <p>"Give me a drink," Polsover gasped. "I haven't had a mouthful to-day, and
  I'm nearly done."</p>

  <p>Mannister mixed him a brandy and soda and filled his pocket with biscuits.
  Polsover held out his hand as he turned away, but Mannister affected not to
  see it.</p>

  <p>"Better luck to you," he said drily, "and good-bye!"</p>

  <p>Polsover hurried away, and Mannister watched him from the window jump into
  the motor-car which was waiting below. Then he turned back into the room and
  drew a little folded paper from his breast coat pocket. With steady fingers
  he drew a firm straight line through the second name upon the list.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-04"
     id="ch-04"></a>IV. THE DEFEAT OF RUNDERMERE</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Cosmopolitan</i>, Jan 1908</h3>

  <p class="first">MANNISTER became aware, some few weeks after the
  disappearance of Polsover, of a certain restraint in the demeanour of both
  Hambledon and Jacobs towards himself. They came less often to Luigi's, and
  though they welcomed him when they did meet there or elsewhere, he had a very
  shrewd suspicion that so far as they were able they were avoiding him. One
  day he taxed them with it, and Hambledon, with somewhat rare candour,
  admitted the fact.</p>

  <p>"It isn't that I'm particularly superstitious, Mannister," he declared,
  "but ever since your return things have gone wrong with us. Poor Ben has been
  obliged to go to Canada over that affair of the bracelet, and they say that
  he's drinking like a fish there, and Polsover we've lost altogether. Both
  these things happened since you came back to us, and within a few weeks of
  one another."</p>

  <p>"You don't suspect&mdash;" Mannister began calmly.</p>

  <p>"Suspect! My dear fellow, how can you even hint at such a thing!"
  Hambledon declared, looking away. "Of course it is a pure coincidence, but
  you must admit that you have not proved altogether a mascot to us. In any
  case we are going quiet just now. No one seems to have any money, and there
  is nothing doing in the city. I dare say something will turn up a little
  later on that we can have a little plunge at. See you soon again, I hope,"
  and Hambledon hurried off.</p>

  <p>Mannister turned away with a smile, and going to his rooms, ordered his
  servant to pack his clothes.</p>

  <p>"We are going down into the country, Morton," he said. "We may be away for
  two or three months. Very likely I shall hunt, so you had better go through
  my things and see what I want."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir," the man answered. "About when shall we be leaving?"</p>

  <p>"The day after to-morrow," Mannister answered. "If I need fresh riding
  things, I can come up later and have them tried on. I am going round now to
  look at some horses."<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>"Who was the new man out on the big bay, Jack?" one of his intimates asked
  the master of the North Westshire hounds, as they rode home one evening.</p>

  <p>"No idea," the Honourable Jack Dunster answered, "but he looks like a
  thundering good sort. I never saw a man sit a horse better, and he took his
  fences like a professional steeplechase rider. Sent us a thumping good
  cheque, too, and a very civil note. I shall look him up to-morrow or the next
  day."</p>

  <p>"What was his name?" the other man asked.</p>

  <p>"Mannister, I think. Something like that, anyhow," the Honourable Jack
  replied.</p>

  <p>"Good name," his friend remarked. "I like the look of the fellow too. If
  you get on with him I shall look him up myself. He looks as though he could
  shoot, and we're awfully short of guns this year."</p>

  <p>They turned round at the sound of a horse's hoofs on the bridle path
  behind.</p>

  <p>"Talk of the devil!" the Honourable Jack remarked. "We'll wait for him if
  you don't mind."</p>

  <p>Mannister rode up to them and raised his hat in answer to the master's
  greeting.</p>

  <p>"I was going to look you up, Mr. Mannister," the Honourable Jack said
  pleasantly, "I hope you'll have a good time down here with us. You had a
  fairly good start to-day, I think."</p>

  <p>"I have had a capital day," Mannister answered, "and I am quite sure one
  can get all the sport one wants down here."</p>

  <p>"You have not hunted with us before, I believe?" the master asked.</p>

  <p>"I have scarcely ever been in the county before," Mannister answered. "I
  am a colonial, although I have relatives in England."</p>

  <p>"This is my friend Lashmore, Mr. Mannister," the Honourable Jack said,
  introducing his companion. "Lord Lashmore is one of our oldest
  supporters."</p>

  <p>"I knew some people of your name up in the north," his Lordship remarked,
  nodding to Mannister.</p>

  <p>"My uncle, I expect," Mannister answered, "Sir George Mannister. His place
  is in Yorkshire, near Skipton."</p>

  <p>"I have dined there once or twice," Lashmore answered. "Jolly good
  sportsman he is. Hope to have the pleasure of looking you up in a day or two,
  Mr. Mannister."</p>

  <p>"I shall be very pleased," Mannister answered civilly. "I expect to be
  here for at least six weeks."</p>

  <p>They reached some cross-roads where their ways parted.</p>

  <p>"You won't come along and have a drink?" the Honourable Jack asked. "It's
  barely half a mile out of your way."</p>

  <p>"Not to-night, thanks," Mannister answered. "I'm afraid my mare's had
  about enough."</p>

  <p>They parted with civil good nights, but Mannister did not at once pursue
  his way to the village. Instead he turned back and rode slowly along the way
  by which he had come. When at last he was sure that the man and the girl whom
  he had passed some time before were coming along, he paused, and dismounting,
  took out a cigarette case and began striking matches. As they passed him he
  looked up, and a little smile parted his lips. He had not been mistaken then.
  He mounted his horse and rode slowly after them.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," he said, as he caught them up, "surely this is Mr. Philip
  Rundermere?"</p>

  <p>The man addressed turned quickly round. He was tall and dark, of almost
  olive complexion in fact, with deep-set black eyes, and somewhat worn face.
  It was obvious that he recognized Mannister, and it was also obvious that the
  recognition was a shock to him.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" he muttered, under his breath. "Why, is that you, Mannister?"
  he added, with a determined attempt to regain his self-possession.</p>

  <p>"Have I changed so much?" Mannister answered, smiling. "I hope you will
  excuse me for making myself known so unceremoniously," he added, raising his
  hat and bowing to the girl who rode by Rundermere's side, "but it is several
  years since I saw my friend here."</p>

  <p>Rundermere was forced to introduce Miss Dunster, but it was obvious that
  he did so under compulsion. Mannister, however, whose manners when he chose
  were as near perfection as possible, affected not to notice his friend's
  coldness.</p>

  <p>"I have just had the pleasure of meeting your father, Miss Dunster," he
  said. "In fact, I only left him a few minutes ago. Are you staying in these
  parts, Rundermere?"</p>

  <p>"I am staying at the <i>White Hart</i> for a week or so," Rundermere
  answered.</p>

  <p>"In that case," Mannister answered, "we shall meet again, for I am at the
  <i>George</i>, exactly opposite. If you will allow me, Miss Dunster, I will
  wish you good-evening. My mare is still fresh enough to manage a canter home,
  I think."</p>

  <p>He raised his hat and passed on ahead. The girl looked after him
  admiringly.</p>

  <p>"What a very handsome man your friend is, Mr. Rundermere," she said, "and
  how beautifully he rides! You did not seem particularly pleased to see
  him."</p>

  <p>Rundermere stooped down and looked into her face.</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose," he said softly, "that I should welcome any one under the
  circumstances?"<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Mannister had the knack of making his bachelor quarters seem always
  attractive. He dined alone and simply, but the silver and the table linen he
  had brought with him from London, and he was the best customer the little
  florist in the village had had for some time. The book-shelves of the
  quaintly furnished sitting-room, too, were filled with his own books, and the
  masculine trifles by which he was surrounded were all the best of their sort.
  Rundermere, who was announced just as he was finishing dinner, looked around
  him and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You always had the knack of making yourself comfortable, Mannister," he
  remarked. "My quarters seem bare enough after yours. May I sit down for a few
  moments?"</p>

  <p>"By all means," Mannister answered calmly. "Will you drink port or whiskey
  and soda?"</p>

  <p>"Neither, thanks, just now," Rundermere answered. "I want to know what the
  devil you are doing down here?"</p>

  <p>Mannister smiled gently.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "I like candour. Since you ask me I will tell you. I am
  down here to hunt. Our friends in London did not seem particularly well
  disposed towards me, and I was bored. I looked up a place where I thought
  that I could be quiet, and where I should not be likely to meet any one I
  knew. After all, though, ours is a very small country."</p>

  <p>Rundermere drew a little breath of relief. "You mean this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Mannister raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he said, "what other reason upon the earth would bring
  me to a benighted region like this?"</p>

  <p>Rundermere hesitated for a moment and then shrugged his shoulders. After
  all, that had been a wild suspicion of his. There was not one chance in
  twenty that Mannister had even an idea how falsely he had been dealt with by
  those men whom he had called his friends. He helped himself to a glass of
  port, and they talked for a few minutes of the day's run.</p>

  <p>"Sit down and make yourself comfortable," Mannister invited him. "I go to
  bed early, but there is time for a pipe at any rate."</p>

  <p>Rundermere excused himself.</p>

  <p>"I am going up to the Hall for some bridge," he said. "I only looked in to
  see you on the way. Do you play, by-the-bye?"</p>

  <p>Mannister shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Bridge came to the front," he remarked, "whilst I was playing another
  sort of game. I have never cared to learn it. Cards don't interest me much,
  except an occasional gamble. We hunt to-morrow, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Quite close here," Rundermere answered. "Very good country, too. I should
  think we ought to have a good day."</p>

  <p>"By-the-bye," Mannister asked, "is that young lady you were riding with
  Mr. Dunster's only daughter?"</p>

  <p>Rundermere looked him in the face steadily.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" he answered. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," Mannister answered calmly, "only I have seen you with her once
  or twice, yesterday and to-day. She's very pretty, but very young, isn't
  she?"</p>

  <p>"She's nineteen," Rundermere answered, and there was a shade of challenge
  in his tone.</p>

  <p>"So old?" Mannister remarked, turning away. "She doesn't look it. Well,
  don't let me keep you from your bridge, Rundermere. Good luck to you!"</p>

  <p>"Good night!" Rundermere answered. "I need to have good luck. They play
  bridge high round here."</p>

  <p>Mannister turned his easy chair to the fire, and sat for nearly half an
  hour with his coffee untasted and his pipe unlit. Somehow he could not get
  the child's face out of his mind, and he was uncomfortably conscious of a
  feeling of strong repulsion when he found himself associating her in any way
  with the man who had just left the room. The frown on his face grew deeper as
  he sat there.</p>

  <p>"What the devil business is it of mine?" he muttered at last, turning and
  striking a match with unnecessary vigour. "Rundermere is a blackguard through
  and through, but if the child believes in him it's her misfortune, not mine.
  I wonder how far he means to go."<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Mannister became in his way a distinctly popular member of the North
  Westshire Hunt. He rode straight, and took a line of his own. He was a fine
  horseman, and though he showed little inclination to make friends, he was
  still always civil, and the women declared his manners were perfection. The
  only person whose society he in any way seemed to seek was May Dunster, the
  girl whom he had met riding home with Rundermere on his first day out. Twice
  he had given her a lead across country, and on each occasion he had ridden
  home with her afterwards. On the second occasion Rundermere, whose horses
  were not of the first class, and who was riding home alone, met him on his
  way back from the Hall, and rode moodily up to his side.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Mannister," he said, "I do not see what the devil you want to
  try and spoil my game for!"</p>

  <p>Mannister turned in his saddle and regarded his companion with gently
  upraised eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Are you in earnest, Rundermere?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course I am," Rundermere answered. "She's a dear little girl, got lots
  of money, and was getting quite fond of me before you came."</p>

  <p>Mannister continued to regard his companion with an air of mild
  wonder.</p>

  <p>"Have you taken leave of your senses, Rundermere?" he asked. "Do you
  realize that you are forty-four or forty-five years old, that your record is
  about as black as a decently born Englishman's can be, that you have never
  gone straight at any time in your life, even with women? You realize these
  things, and yet you talk of being in earnest with a poor little child like
  this!"</p>

  <p>Rundermere's dark face was black with passion.</p>

  <p>"D&mdash;n you, Mannister!" he said. "You go too far. A man has to settle
  down some time, and many worse than I have done it. Your own record isn't
  altogether spotless, is it? I should like to know what has become of
  Sinclair!"</p>

  <p>Mannister looked steadily between his horse's ears.</p>

  <p>"Rundermere," he said, "there are two names which I do not permit any man
  to mention in my presence. One is Sinclair's, the other a lady's. I only wish
  to warn you that if you should forget this little whim of mine, your lips
  will not be in a condition for use for a considerable time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Rundermere rode on in savage silence, which remained unbroken until they
  reached the outskirts of the village. Then he turned once more to his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Mannister," he said, "why can't you go your way and let me go
  mine. I don't wish to interfere with you, and I can't see that I'm doing you
  any harm."</p>

  <p>Mannister laughed enigmatically as he turned away into the covered yard of
  his inn.</p>

  <p>"I make no bargains with you, Rundermere," he said. "I act as it pleases
  me."</p>

  <p>On his table Mannister found a note from the Hall, asking him to dine that
  night. He stood for several minutes holding it in his hand, apparently
  undecided. Then, with a little shrug of the shoulders, he dashed off a hasty
  affirmative. This was the fourth invitation he had received, only one of
  which he had accepted. This one he would have declined but for some little
  gossip of the hunting field which had come to his ears during the day's run.
  There had been some very high play at the Hall during the last few nights,
  and Rundermere had been in luck. Rundermere and a friend of his had been
  partners, and won a record rubber. Mannister wondered, as he tied his white
  tie, who that friend might be. He had caught a glimpse of him in the hunting
  field and recognized his calibre instinctively. He felt himself curious as he
  climbed into his dogcart and drove off to Dunster Hall, to know whether
  Rundermere and his friend would be there that night.</p>

  <p>The dinner-party at the Hall that evening was quite a small one. Besides
  himself and a sister of Mr. Dunster's, there were only Lord Lashmore,
  Rundermere, and his friend Captain Harrison, as guests. Captain Harrison was
  a colourless-looking man, with faint sandy moustache, and an exceedingly
  quiet manner. He spoke to scarcely any one during dinner-time, and took
  little, if any wine.</p>

  <p>"One of the finest bridge players I ever saw," his host said in an
  undertone to Mannister, as they drew closer together after the women had
  left. "His finesses are positive inspirations. Rundermere isn't bad himself,
  but his friend knocks spots off him. They had the devil's own luck last night
  too, drew together almost every rubber."</p>

  <p>Mannister was interested, and would like to have prolonged the
  conversation, but Rundermere intervened with an inquiry about some
  two-year-olds, which brought their host on to one of his favourite subjects.
  Mannister, hearing music in the hall, excused himself presently, and strolled
  out to where May Dunster was playing a small organ. She jumped up directly
  she saw him.</p>

  <p>"Do come and look at our new fountain, Mr. Mannister," she said. "We have
  set it going to-day for the first time."</p>

  <p>He followed her into the conservatory and duly admired the fountain.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she said, laying her hand upon his arm, "I did not bring you
  here to look at it. You can guess that, can't you?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I had an idea," he remarked, "that you had something to say to me."</p>

  <p>She looked at him, standing up against the background of palm trees, tall,
  distinguished, with hard bronzed face, a little lined, but showing as yet no
  sign of middle age. Was it indeed a cruel face, she wondered, remembering
  what some one had remarked a few days before. She sighed as she looked away.
  At any rate there was very little sentiment there. Even the not infrequent
  smile was a thing which had little to do with mirth.</p>

  <p>"I want to ask you something about Mr. Rundermere," she said. "He is a
  friend of yours, is he not?"</p>

  <p>A very slight frown appeared on Mannister's face as he looked down into
  her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I could not go so far as to admit that," he said. "I have very few
  friends. Rundermere was an acquaintance of mine some years ago."</p>

  <p>"You do not like him!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I do not," he answered. "Do you?"</p>

  <p>"I wish I could tell you that!" she exclaimed, looking up at him,
  perplexed&mdash;a little distressed. "Sometimes I think I like him very much,
  sometimes I do not trust him at all, sometimes I hate him, sometimes I feel
  that it would be very easy to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To what?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"To do what he wants me to do," she said softly, "to care for him."</p>

  <p>"Am I right," Mannister said, leaning a little toward her, "in assuming
  that you want my advice?"</p>

  <p>"Please," she asked.</p>

  <p>"Look at me, child," he said.</p>

  <p>She looked, and it seemed to her that it was a different man whose face
  was bent towards hers. There was something softer and kinder in the eyes,
  some lightening of the cold firm lines of his mouth. He seemed suddenly so
  much nearer to her.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Do I look like a truthful person?" he asked. "Stop a minute, let me tell
  you this. I have committed most crimes which are possible to a selfish man
  who loves his liberty, but I have never lied to a woman. Do you believe
  me?"</p>

  <p>Her hands rested upon his very softly. It needed only a movement on his
  part to turn their touch into a caress.</p>

  <p>"You know that I do," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Then believe me when I tell you that there is no man upon this earth less
  fit to be your husband than Philip Rundermere. He has committed a sin in
  daring to ask you such a thing, a sin for which he will have to answer.
  Promise me that you will not think of him in that way any more."</p>

  <p>Her head dropped almost to her hands. Her whisper was so faint it scarcely
  reached his ear.</p>

  <p>"I promise," she murmured.</p>

  <p>He drew his hands gently away.</p><br>

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Little girl," he said softly, "you are very young, and you have seen very
  little indeed of the world, but after you have lived a few years longer you
  will know that it is not middle-aged men whose lives lie behind them, like
  Rundermere and myself, who should dare to ask these things of you. Keep that
  tender little heart of yours safe until the right time comes. Very soon you
  will understand what I mean."</p>

  <p>Almost without her knowing it he slipped away.</p>

  <p>Mannister strolled into the library, where the other four men were already
  seated at the bridge table. His host looked up as he entered.</p>

  <p>"Come and cut in, Mannister," he said. "We have not started yet."</p>

  <p>Mannister shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," he said, "it's an ignoble confession to make, but I do not play
  bridge. I will smoke if I may, and look at the <i>Field</i>."</p>

  <p>The Honourable Jack, having done his duty towards his guest, was much too
  interested in the game to think further about him for the present. He and
  Lord Lashmore were once more partners against Rundermere and Harrison, and
  the fortunes of the game seemed still inclined toward the visitors. Mannister
  read an article in the <i>Field</i> carefully through, word by word, before
  he raised his eyes. During that time Rundermere had three times turned round
  in his chair to watch him, and noted the fact that he was apparently absorbed
  in his paper. When he had finished the article, however, Mannister raised his
  head, and from behind the cover of the journal which he held, he devoted his
  entire attention upon the game which the four men were playing. After a while
  he changed his position, and throwing down the <i>Field</i>, crossed the room
  with a yawn, and stood before a picture at the other side of the card table.
  His host glanced towards him with a momentary impulse of neglected
  hospitality.</p>

  <p>"Sure you would not like to come in, Mannister?" he asked. "I'm afraid it
  is awfully slow for you."</p>

  <p>"I would not come in for worlds," Mannister answered. "Don't bother about
  entertaining me. I'm going round the room looking at your prints now. Rather
  a hobby of mine, prints."</p>

  <p>Another quarter of an hour passed. Then Mannister went to a writing-table
  and wrote a few sentences upon a sheet of notepaper. He thrust it into his
  waistcoat pocket, and lighting another cigarette, leaned his elbow upon the
  mantelpiece, and seemed to be watching the game with languid interest. When
  it was Dunster's turn to be dummy, he called him softly over.</p>

  <p>"I wish," he said, "you'd explain the meaning of this print to me."</p>

  <p>Dunster followed him over to the further corner of the room. Mannister
  took the paper from his waistcoat pocket and smoothed it out.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Dunster," he said, "I am sorry to say that you and Lord Lashmore are
  being robbed by a pair of card sharpers. Don't!" he added sharply, as Dunster
  was about to betray his astonishment by an angry exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Are you in earnest, Mr. Mannister?" his host asked.</p>

  <p>"Absolute and sober earnest," Mannister replied, "and you can prove it for
  yourself if you will. Am I not right in supposing that Captain Harrison and
  Rundermere have drawn together as partners nearly every rubber that has been
  played?"</p>

  <p>"That is so," Mr. Dunster admitted stiffly, "but we have always cut."</p>

  <p>"Cutting," Mannister said, "is a ridiculously easy matter for an expert
  like Rundermere's friend. Of course, I have not had time to make out the
  complete code, but there are signals which pass between them to determine the
  declarations, and also asking for a lead. You see there are two codes for the
  declarations. In the first Harrison's foot is pressed against his partner's,
  once for spades, twice for clubs, three times for diamonds, four times for
  hearts, and a quick tap for no trumps. That in itself is absolutely easy in
  the case of unsuspicious opponents. But in case that fails, watch their way
  of holding their cards. The five fingers are on the last five cards, or some
  are pushed together to make the code. It is as simple as ABC. Now watch. Your
  partner is playing a losing trick. It will be Rundermere's lead directly. Now
  watch Harrison's fingers."</p>

  <p>Rundermere took the trick and hesitated. Harrison glanced through his
  cards, and one of his fingers moved slightly. His first finger was against
  the third card from the end in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Rundermere will lead a diamond," Mannister whispered, and almost as he
  spoke Rundermere led a small card from that suit.</p>

  <p>Dunster had the look of a man who had seen a ghost.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of this sort," he said, "has ever taken place in my house.
  Mannister, don't you think there is a chance that you are mistaken?"</p>

  <p>Mannister shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Excuse yourself for a moment," he said, "and read that code through in
  the next room. It is not complete, of course. There are variations as to a
  high or low card which I cannot quite follow. But if you watch for the next
  half-hour, you will see enough to convince you or any one."</p>

  <p>Dunster excused himself for a moment, and when he came back he went
  straight to the sideboard and poured himself out a brandy and soda.</p>

  <p>"Lost two tricks did we, partner?" he said. "I thought my hand was a fair
  one, too."</p>

  <p>"Every finesse went against us," Lashmore said gloomily, "and every card
  in their hands seemed to make."</p>

  <p>Dunster resumed his seat and the game progressed. Mannister reclined in an
  easy-chair, the <i>Field</i> still before him, but his eyes half closed. Then
  suddenly Dunster rose to his feet, and laid his cards face downwards on the
  table.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he said calmly, "I regret that this game cannot go on."</p>

  <p>Lashmore looked at him in blank amazement. Rundermere was suddenly as pale
  as death, and his eyes had the wild stare of a man who is stricken by a
  sudden terror.</p>

  <p>"What the devil do you mean, Dunster?" Lashmore asked.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Rundermere and Captain Harrison," Dunster said calmly, "know very
  well what I mean. No money, I believe, has changed hands to-night. The
  records of this game will be destroyed. Mr. Rundermere, I am ringing for your
  dog-cart. You will find it convenient, I trust, to finish your season's
  hunting elsewhere."</p>

  <p>Rundermere rose to his feet a little unsteadily. For a moment he seemed
  about to fight, but he looked past Dunster's determined face to where
  Mannister lolled in his easy-chair with a mocking smile upon his lips. He
  left the room, and Harrison followed his cue. Dunster turned towards
  Mannister and wiped the perspiration from his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Mannister," he said, "I suppose I ought to thank you. You had to tell me,
  of course, but I would not have had this happen for a thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>Mannister laughed softly as he made his way to the writing-table.</p>

  <p>"I see," he said, "that you have some ink here. Allow me!"</p>

  <p>He took a pen from the rack and a paper from his pocket. Then with a
  little sigh of satisfaction he drew a straight firm line through the third
  name on the list.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-05"
     id="ch-05"></a>V. THE END OF JOHN DYKES&mdash;BURGLAR</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Cosmopolitan</i>, Mar 1908</h3>

  <p class="first">MANNISTER brought his brief stay amongst the North
  Westshire's to a close within the next few days. Harrison and Rundermere had
  disappeared as though from the face of the earth, but Dunster, although he
  was still civil and tried to show his gratitude, was obviously not at his
  ease with the man who had exposed the character of his guests, and May's
  white face and pathetic eyes seemed to haunt him wherever he went. He became
  conscious very soon that she was taking every opportunity to throw herself in
  his way, and with a little shrug of the shoulders one night he ordered his
  man to pack his dressing-case, and was driven away to catch the last train to
  London, leaving his horses to be sold, and the remainder of his effects
  brought up to him later on. He saw little of his old associates during his
  first few days in town, but he met Jacobs one afternoon, and talked to him
  idly for a few minutes. The conversation, which was somewhat one-sided,
  amused Mannister. Jacobs was unable to stand still or look him in the face.
  He was overcome with the nervousness which is akin to fear.</p>

  <p>"By-the-bye," the latter said, "I heard yesterday that Sophy De la Mere
  was about to be married."</p>

  <p>Mannister was quietly interested.</p>

  <p>"To whom?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I have forgotten the name," Jacobs said, "but it's some boy or other,
  about half her age. They are down at Brighton together now."</p>

  <p>Mannister smiled, and that night he dined at the <i>Metropole</i> at
  Brighton. After a glance through the visitors' register he removed his
  portmanteau to a more select and smaller place, further down the sea-front.
  The first person he saw after he had engaged his room was the lady whose name
  had been mentioned to him that morning. She was crossing the hall alone, and
  he watched her for a few moments critically. She was still a handsome woman,
  with a figure which seemed well enough, however much it may have owed to the
  <i>corseti&egrave;re</i>. Her features had always been good, and her long eyes,
  almond shaped, and of a peculiar shade of brown, were as attractive as ever.
  Yes, she was a dangerous woman still, especially to a boy. She did not
  pretend to show any pleasure at seeing him there. She stopped short for a
  moment with a little start of surprise. Then she came slowly on towards
  him.</p>

  <p>"My dear Mrs. De la Mere," he said, bowing over her hand, "I fear that for
  once in my life, at any rate, you are not glad to see me. Tell me what I have
  done that you should look at me as though I were an unwelcome ghost."</p>

  <p>She laughed naturally enough. She had the pluck of a regiment of men, and
  it was not often that her nerve failed her.</p>

  <p>"There are times, you know," she said, "when one does not want to see even
  one's best friends, and I am not sure," she added, more slowly, "whether I
  should ever dare to reckon you amongst my best friends."</p>

  <p>"Dear lady," he said, looking at her with a peculiar light in his eyes,
  "exactly how much of friendship have you deserved of me?"</p>

  <p>"Men do not pay women according to their deserts," she answered. "It is
  your province to forgive, to make the least of injuries, to remember that we
  scarcely meet as equal foes."</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"Your tongue," he remarked, "is as subtle as ever. If you were an
  advocate, you would steal justice from the jury as you steal the hearts of
  men to-day. Tell me, by-the-bye, why you are not pleased to see me at
  Brighton."</p>

  <p>"A few months ago," she murmured, "it became necessary, in our joint
  interests, that you should confide in me a very little. It was that little
  affair of Traske and the bracelet, you remember. I gathered then that there
  were several others beside Traske upon your black list."</p>

  <p>"You yourself, my dear lady, I am sorry to say," he said, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Ah, well!" she declared, "I like this better. It is open war, then. Let
  it be so. I prefer it. Remember, then, that I do not know you, that if you
  speak to me again I shall treat you as any other impertinent person who is
  guilty of presumption."</p>

  <p>She left him with her head in the air, and a little flutter of laces and
  perfume, her own peculiar perfume, familiar to him for many years. He
  shrugged his shoulders and turned into the smoking-room, not altogether too
  pleased. Open war made the game more difficult.</p>

  <p>The smoke-room he discovered was in its way somewhat unique. It was
  Oriental in design and architecture, and a number of small partitions ran
  round the room, in which were lounges and small three-legged tables.
  Mannister entered one, and calling a waiter, ordered a whiskey and soda and
  the evening paper. He had scarcely begun to read, however, when he was
  interrupted by a distinct snore from the next partition. He leaned round the
  corner and looked to see from whom the sound came. Then he picked up his
  paper and whiskey and soda, and quietly changed his place into the next
  recess. On the lounge immediately in front of him, a man was stretched. He
  was half asleep and half drunk. His collar had given way, his tie and
  waistcoat were stained with wine. In front of him was an empty champagne
  bottle and a partially smoked cigar. Mannister studied him for several
  moments and then called for a waiter.</p>

  <p>"Do you allow people in this condition to lie about the smoke-room of the
  hotel?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The waiter was apologetic.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman is very well known here, sir," he said, "or we should have
  had him turned out. I thought as there was no one else in the room we might
  let him stay and sleep it off. I have not often seen him as bad as this, sir,
  but he is never quarrelsome. He will be all right when he wakes up!"</p>

  <p>"You say that he is well known down here," Mannister remarked. "Do you
  mean that he lives in Brighton?"</p>

  <p>"He lives at this hotel most of his time," the waiter answered, "although
  he goes up to London most days."</p>

  <p>"I think," Mannister said, regarding the sleeping man, "that I know him by
  sight. Is his name John Dykes?"</p>

  <p>"That is it, sir," the waiter assented, "Mr. John Dykes. I have heard that
  he is a partner in a book-making firm."</p>

  <p>Mannister nodded.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said, "don't disturb him If he wakes up while I am here, I
  will see that he does not make himself objectionable."</p>

  <p>The waiter hurried away to serve some newcomers, and Mannister divided his
  attention between the paper which he held and the features of the man who lay
  on the couch before him. Certainly there was nothing in the appearance of Mr.
  John Dykes to appeal to the lover of the beautiful. He was short and
  thick-set. His round face was innocent of beard or moustache, but his
  complexion was of a grey, unhealthy colour, and his teeth were far from
  perfect. His clothes were expensive, but they hung about him badly. In sleep,
  at any rate, his appearance was almost repulsive.</p>

  <p>"Mr. John Dykes," Mannister said slowly to himself, "I wonder what you are
  doing in Brighton. You have not improved, Johnnie," he added, looking him
  over with quiet disgust. "You were never much to look at, but you've gone
  backwards if anything a little. I think I'd like to have a chat with
  you."</p>

  <p>He leaned over and struck the sleeping man upon the shoulder. Dykes sat up
  suddenly and stared at Mannister, his mouth open in bewildered surprise.</p>

  <p>"Eh! Eh what?" he exclaimed. "By Heavens it's Mannister! Where have I got
  to?"</p>

  <p>He looked round the place, and apparently remembered.</p>

  <p>"I must have been asleep," he muttered, looking at the empty bottle. "What
  a throat I've got! Do you mind touching the bell?"</p>

  <p>Then he apparently seemed to suddenly remember who his neighbour was, and
  he looked at him with astonishment mingled with fear.</p>

  <p>"Mannister!" he muttered. "Why, man, I thought&mdash;we
  thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You thought I was never likely to return to England again," Mannister
  continued calmly. "It was just a little miscalculation, that's all. I am
  here, as you see. I have seen something of most of the others, but I was
  wondering what had become of you. I think it was Polsover who told me that
  you'd been doing pretty well, or was it Hambledon? No, it must have been
  Hambledon."</p>

  <p>The man was sitting up now. He called for a waiter and ordered a brandy
  and soda.</p>

  <p>"So you're back again," he said, "and in with the old crowd, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Mannister assented. "I am in with the old crowd. My welcome
  back, I must confess, was not exactly boisterous, still I think that I am
  making my presence felt."</p>

  <p>Dykes nodded heavily.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he said, "that you've come down instead of that young
  blackguard Jacobs."</p>

  <p>Mannister did not hesitate for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," he replied. "They thought it was better that I should come.
  Jacobs is rather well known in Brighton."</p>

  <p>"If you'd come punctually," John Dykes grumbled, "you'd have saved my
  making a bit of a fool of myself. I began to think that I must have made a
  mistake, and that it was to-morrow, not to-day."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," Mannister said. "The appointment was for to-day, but I went
  in error to the wrong hotel. Suppose you go in and have a wash, and then
  drink that brandy and soda. We might get on with our business then."</p>

  <p>John Dykes rose, and lumbered heavily across the room. Mannister called
  him back.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "go and put a clean collar on, and brush yourself
  up. You're not fit to be about the place like that."</p>

  <p>"All right," Dykes grumbled, and stumbled toward the door. Mannister
  returned to his seat with a smile. He still had some of his old power over
  these men, the power which seems to belong to some as a natural gift. He sat
  down, and lighting a cigarette, looked thoughtfully up toward the ceiling.
  Dykes was down here on business of some sort, and was waiting for Jacobs. His
  sudden idea of taking Jacobs' place had been accepted. Was it possible that
  remaining in absolute ignorance of whatever this particular piece of business
  might be, he could play Jacobs' part until he had learnt whether it was of
  sufficient importance to make his interference worth while? At any rate he
  was running no risk, and as regards his first mission to Brighton, he had
  already arrived at a cul-de-sac. It was scarcely likely that he would be able
  to bluff Dykes into telling him anything, if the matter was one of
  importance. On the other hand, the man was still in a stupid state, and the
  experiment would at any rate cost nothing.</p>

  <p>Dykes returned, heavy-eyed and leaden cheeked, but looking a little
  tidier, and inclined to be as amiable as he knew how. He drank the second
  brandy and soda which Mannister considerately ordered for him, at a gulp.</p>

  <p>"I say," he remarked, "there is no need to mention this." He pointed to
  the empty bottle. "Eh?"</p>

  <p>Mannister assented with a little nod of the head.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said, "I don't want to make mischief. By-the-bye,
  Hambledon thought you'd better just go over this matter again to me. There
  was not time for him to explain much, and as you know I've only just come
  back."</p>

  <p>Dykes looked for a moment a trifle surprised.</p>

  <p>"I supposed you knew all about it," he said, looking at Mannister
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Of course I do," Mannister answered, "but I didn't find Hambledon very
  clear upon some of the points. I should like to hear it from you in your own
  words. You have a knack of putting these things clearly."</p>

  <p>Dykes called the waiter.</p>

  <p>"I can't talk unless I drink," he said. "I've got a throat like a brick
  kiln. Thank Heavens you aren't Hambledon! He'd shut me off liquor for a week,
  and at the end of that time I should not have the nerve of a kitten."</p>

  <p>"Moderation," Mannister said, "is best for you, I am sure. We will say one
  more brandy and soda."</p>

  <p>"It's in this way," Dykes said, leaning across the table after a careful
  glance around. "You know very well that although all of us run a bit close to
  the edge now and then, we're not a gang of thieves, and we do not care about
  getting on the wrong side of the law. This little affair comes perilously
  near it, which is why Hambledon and the others have kept me waiting here
  before they decided whether to go on or not. I take it from your wanting to
  hear the whole thing from me, that they've left it with you to decide. Well,
  here goes. It was Rundermere," John Dykes continued, leaning over the table,
  and speaking in a hoarse, indistinct whisper, "who first tumbled to the
  thing. He was hunting up in Westshire, and got to know the girl and her
  father. Her father was the master of a small pack of hounds there, and Phil
  got on visiting terms with them. What his game was I don't know, and it don't
  particularly concern us, but the girl and he were evidently pretty thick.
  What's wrong, eh?" he broke off a little abruptly. "You look as though you
  were seeing things."</p>

  <p>"Nothing is wrong," Mannister said calmly, "I can assure you I was
  listening intently. Of course you are speaking now of the Honourable Jack
  Dunster and his daughter."</p>

  <p>John Dykes nodded.</p>

  <p>"I see," he remarked, "that you have a good memory for names. Phil and the
  young woman must have got pretty thick, for she told him all about her going
  to Court this first drawing-room, and her coming to Brighton first to stay
  with her aunt. Every one in the neighbourhood knew about her jewels, but
  again it was she who told him that she was going to bring them up with her to
  have them reset, so that she could wear some of them when she went to Court.
  I saw Rundermere in town a day or so ago, looking pretty sick he was too, and
  he told me, half in joke, that if I could find a man to do a little polite
  burgling, there were fifty thousand pounds worth of diamonds coming down to
  Brighton which would be worth looking after. Well, I couldn't help
  remembering the name, although I thought no more about it, so you can guess
  how I felt when the Johnnie who looks after my clothes here told me that
  every other room in this corridor on my side, had been taken by a Lady Mary
  Dunster and her niece and servants."</p>

  <p>"They are here now?" Mannister asked calmly.</p>

  <p>"They are in the hotel at this identical moment," Dykes answered. "There
  is the girl, and she's a peach. There is the old aunt, a bit of a tough 'un,
  but blazing with diamonds herself. Then there is a companion of the aunt,
  another bony old young lady, who don't seem to count for much, and two maids.
  The rummest part of the whole thing is that the young woman's room is next to
  mine, and the jewels are in an ordinary black despatch box with an
  eighteen-penny padlock, underneath her bed."</p>

  <p>"How do you know this?" Mannister asked.</p>

  <p>"Why, she had visitors the other day, and I heard her fetch one out of her
  aunt's room to come and see her jewels. I slipped into the room opposite,
  which was empty, and I heard her drag the box out from under the bed. They
  left the door open and I passed along the corridor a moment or two later, and
  there they all were upon the bed. Never in my whole life have I ever known
  such a soft thing. I heard one of the young women scold her for having the
  jewels up in her bed-room, and she only laughed, and said something about it
  being much safer to take no particular pains about them, because then no one
  would think they were valuable. I tell you it's just the easiest job I've
  ever known."</p>

  <p>"What do you propose, then?" Mannister asked calmly.</p>

  <p>"Well, I've got a key to the padlock," Dykes answered. "I could have
  walked off with the box the afternoon that I looked in to see the lock, but I
  hadn't any plans for getting rid of it. I can get the jewels any night after
  she's gone to sleep, without fear of waking her. The only trouble will be to
  pass them on to some one who can leave the hotel without suspicion. That's
  where you come in."</p>

  <p>Mannister nodded thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," he remarked. "I quite see that."</p>

  <p>"Where are you staying?" Dykes asked.</p>

  <p>"At the <i>Metropole</i>," Mannister declared.</p>

  <p>"That's all right," Dykes went on. "All we've got to do is to fix upon a
  time. Then you pay the bill at your hotel, you bring your luggage, you stop
  your cab outside this place, you come up to my room to say goodbye to me. You
  tell them in the hall you will be down in a second, and you come down in five
  minutes or so with the diamonds in your pocket. You light a cigarette in the
  hall, give a small tip to the commissionaire who opens your cab door, and off
  you go to London. Hambledon is going to make some inquiries in the city, and
  if he thinks it best for you to go straight to Antwerp, he will meet you, but
  I should doubt whether it would be necessary. You see the joke of the whole
  thing is that I've been practically living in this hotel for five years, and
  there is not a soul would suspect me or any visitor of mine. I've always paid
  my way and tipped the servants well, and they think I am a bit of a
  millionaire."</p>

  <p>"The whole thing," Mannister remarked, "seems absurdly easy, but why
  choose the night at all? Why not slip in when the girl's out during the
  afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"Well," Dykes answered, sipping a fresh brandy and soda, "the girl has
  just enough sense to lock up her room when she goes out, and being on the
  first floor, there are servants passing the whole of the time. I could get a
  key to her room easy enough, but there'd always be a big chance of being seen
  going in or coming out. You see there's a service room almost opposite. She
  goes to bed absurdly early every night, supposed to be delicate or something
  of the sort, and everything's quiet in her room long before eleven. I thought
  if I slipped in there about twenty minutes to twelve, and you came into my
  room at exactly that time, you would just catch the twelve o'clock to
  London."</p>

  <p>"Supposing you wake her?" Mannister asked. "She might not even be
  asleep."</p>

  <p>"I shall be prepared for that," Dykes answered, a little grimly, "not that
  I mean to do the child any mischief, of course, but she'll be easy enough to
  keep quiet for a few minutes. The servants go down from my floor at eleven
  o'clock, and the night porter does not come on duty till midnight, so
  naturally the quietest time is between eleven and twelve. Now that's my idea.
  Do you think it good enough?"</p>

  <p>"What do you say is the value of the diamonds?" Mannister asked,
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"The girl told Rundermere," he answered, "that they were worth at least
  fifty thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"We both of us," Mannister remarked, "run a fair amount of risk. How many
  of us are there to stand in?"</p>

  <p>"Five," Dykes answered. "Besides ourselves there are Rundermere, Jacobs
  and Hambledon. The idea was to divide two-thirds between us two, and a third
  between the other three."</p>

  <p>Mannister nodded.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said, "I should like to go up into your room, and I should
  like you to show me the door of the young lady's room. If everything is
  really as you say, I think it seems good enough, but there is one thing which
  I have to tell you."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Dykes asked.</p>

  <p>"Rundermere sent word round this morning that some one from Streeter's was
  going down to-morrow for the jewels, so if you really mean business it would
  have to be tonight. I am afraid you are not exactly in condition for this
  sort of work."</p>

  <p>Dykes straightened himself and frowned.</p>

  <p>"I can pull myself together," he said quickly. "I'd rather have had a day
  or so to get straight in, but it can't be helped. I was afraid somehow that
  some meddling relative or other would suggest having the jeweller come down
  here, instead of waiting until they were in London. To tell you the truth,
  Mannister," he continued, leaning confidentially across the little table,
  "things have gone a bit queer with me lately, and I am relying upon this to
  pull me round. Safe though it seems, I would not touch it if I was not
  d&mdash;d hard up. It's a drop lower than anything we've touched before, but
  it's a big business, and it's safe. I am glad you don't mind going for it.
  Come up and see the rooms now. It's easy enough to take you up. I often have
  some pals there."</p>

  <p>Mannister rose and paid for the brandies and sodas. He glanced at the
  clock. It was already twenty minutes past seven...</p>

  <p>Mannister met Mrs. De la Mere in the hall as he came down to dinner. She
  would have passed him by, but he stopped her quietly.</p>

  <p>"My dear Sophy," he said, "go in peace for the present. Good luck to your
  little matrimonial schemes. A little later on I may have something to say to
  you."</p>

  <p>She raised her eyebrows, but her assumed indifference was ill-done for so
  clever an actress.</p>

  <p>"I am immensely relieved," she assured him. "We are once more friends,
  then."</p>

  <p>Mannister bowed, and went on to the manager's office. The manager, who had
  seen Mannister's luggage, and noted the excellent hang of his dinner-coat,
  was exceedingly civil.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," Mannister said, "that I am going to waste your time, but if
  you have two minutes to spare&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The manager sprang up, and wheeled an armchair to the fire.</p>

  <p>"Anything we can do for you, Mr. Mannister," he said politely. "Can I
  quote you reduced terms for a lengthened stay, or do you wish your room
  changed?"</p>

  <p>"Neither, thank you," Mannister answered. "The fact is I am afraid you
  will think that I have come on a fool's errand, but in the smoke-room this
  afternoon I was accosted by a man who was evidently in a half drunken state,
  and he insisted upon taking me for some one whom he knew, and telling me the
  details of a robbery which he declared that he was about to attempt in your
  hotel this evening."</p>

  <p>The manager was serious enough now, but a little dubious.</p>

  <p>"Has the man gone, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," Mannister answered, "I believe that he is staying here.
  That is why I preferred to see you privately, rather than run the risk of our
  all making idiots of ourselves. His name is Mr. John Dykes, and I believe he
  is a book-maker, or something of the sort."</p>

  <p>"Mr. John Dykes!" the manager repeated, incredulously. "Why, he has lived
  in this hotel for years."</p>

  <p>"He is none the less, I should think," Mannister remarked, "something of
  an adventurer. From what I could understand, there is a young lady in the
  room next to him, who has about fifty thousand pounds worth of diamonds lying
  about loose. It sounds like a drunken man's story, but you know for yourself
  whether that part of it is true or not."</p>

  <p>"There is a young lady in the room next to him," the manager admitted
  slowly, "and she certainly has some valuable jewellery, which she will not
  permit me, by-the-bye, to take care of."</p>

  <p>"Then if so much of the man's story is true," Mannister said, "let me
  suggest that you set a watch on the corridor outside her room to-night. He
  told me that he meant to make the attempt between half-past eleven or twelve,
  and to get away, or to send the jewels away by a confederate, by the twelve
  o'clock train to London. My own room is on that corridor, and I shall be
  awake and ready to join in if necessary."</p>

  <p>"I am very much obliged to you, sir," the manager said. "This is a very
  serious matter, and I shall certainly have the corridor protected. In fact I
  shall watch myself. At the same time, Mr. Dykes has been a very good customer
  here, although he is not quite the class of visitor whom we desire to
  encourage. Still, he has always paid his way, and he is here in season and
  out of season."</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about the fellow," Mannister remarked, rising to take his
  leave, "except that he was three-quarters drunk this afternoon, and evidently
  took me for one of his friends. Of course, what I have told you I have told
  you in confidence. I do not care about being drawn into the matter beyond the
  fact that I shall certainly appear if my aid is necessary."</p>

  <p>The manager bowed out his visitor. Mannister crossed the hall and entered
  the dining-room. His first intention had been to dine and then walk back to
  the <i>Metropole</i>, stay there until eleven o'clock, then return to his
  room here. About half way through the meal, however, he was conscious that
  Dykes was watching him covertly through the glass partition at the other end
  of the room. Something in the man's face and attitude inspired Mannister with
  a new suggestion.</p>

  <p>Dykes, as he knew very well, was no fool. It seemed very probable that as
  his drunken fit wore off, and his usual cunning reasserted itself, he would
  regard Mannister's presence and co-operation in his scheme with a certain
  amount of suspicion. His present demeanour was almost a confirmation of this.
  He desired evidently to remain himself unseen, but he was watching Mannister
  covertly, and obviously intended to see whether or no he left the hotel.
  Mannister, affecting not to notice him, paid his bill for dinner, regardless
  of the fact that he was staying in the hotel, and leaving the room in a
  leisurely manner to allow Dykes time to watch him, put on his hat and coat
  and started round for the <i>Metropole</i>. He stayed there only long enough
  to buy a handful of cigarettes, and leaving the hotel by the back way,
  returned to the <i>Bedford</i>, and reached his own room without seeing
  anything of Dykes. He turned out the electric light, and leaving his door
  ajar, sat on the bed and prepared to listen. In less than five minutes he
  heard exactly what he had expected. Dykes' door was softly opened, and Dykes
  himself came out into the corridor. For a moment or two he stood there,
  looking rapidly up and down. Then he fitted a key into the door exactly
  opposite Mannister's, opened it, and disappeared. Mannister opened his door a
  little wider, and stood there waiting to accost him when he might come out.
  The events of the next few seconds happened so quickly that Mannister,
  although he always blamed himself for allowing the girl to run such a risk,
  knew upon reflection that he could not possibly have prevented it. The door
  of Miss Dunster's aunt's room was suddenly opened. May Dunster herself came
  softly out, pushed open her own door, which was ajar, and closing it after
  her, disappeared. The shriek which almost immediately broke from her lips was
  half stifled by the simultaneous slamming of the door. Mannister heard enough
  to terrify him. He sprang across the corridor, and found to his joy the key
  still in the lock. He was inside in a second. The girl was in Dykes' arms,
  and his right hand was drawn back as though he meant to strike her and throw
  her away from him at the same time. The empty box was upon the bed, and his
  pockets were bulging. He half turned his head as Mannister entered, and
  relaxed his hold of the girl. For the moment he seemed uncertain as to
  whether Mannister had come as friend or foe. Then something in the newcomer's
  face told him, and with a savage cry he rushed at him, butting upwards with
  his left arm, and holding his right in reserve. Mannister, however, was
  prepared, and Dykes went down like a log, felled by one lightning-like blow.
  Mannister stood quite still, breathing hard. The fallen man's fist had just
  touched his jaw&mdash;there were not many tricks in the prize-fighting ring
  which Dykes did not know. For a moment the room seemed to spin round. Then he
  regained his self-control to find the girl standing before him, her eyes like
  stars, and her hands uplifted.</p>

  <p>"You!" she exclaimed. "It is you always who come when I need help."</p>

  <p>She was almost in his arms. He was conscious of a sudden wild beating of
  the pulses, a sense of excitement such as he had not known for many years. He
  held her hands, but he kept her from coming nearer. He might do that, but he
  could not help the things which flashed from her eyes into his and found,
  perhaps, some answer.</p>

  <p>"Don't you hear them all coming?" he said. "I heard you call out just in
  time. My room was opposite."</p>

  <p>The room was full of people, an excited waiter, a valet, some one from the
  office below. Dykes, whom they had forgotten, staggered suddenly to his feet,
  and for a moment was master of the situation. He stood with his back to the
  wall, and something small and shining flashed in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Which shall it be, Mannister, you or the girl?" he cried out. "You
  hound!"</p>

  <p>Mannister swung the girl behind him, and a valet whose wages were a pound
  a week, earned for himself a public house near London, and a good deal of
  prospective prosperity. With a presence of mind rather remarkable, he leaned
  over and snapped down the electric light switch. The room was plunged into
  sudden darkness. Mannister stole toward the door with his arms round the
  girl. They could hear nothing but Dykes' hoarse breathing. Then suddenly the
  sound for which they waited with nerves strung almost to breaking point,
  came. In the small room the sound of the revolver shot, echoing backwards and
  forwards, sounded almost like a cannonade. Mannister, who had found the door,
  swung the girl out into the corridor. The other three men were already there.
  They turned on the lights and peered into the room. Dykes lay there a
  crumpled up mass, the revolver still locked in his hand.</p>

  <p>"The man has shot himself," Mannister said calmly. "Quite the best thing
  he could do. This is your aunt here, is it not, Miss Dunster? You had better
  go to her."</p>

  <p>"You must come too," she begged. "I want her to know."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," he interrupted, a little sadly. "You must let me go now. I
  must talk to all these people."<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>For the next hour or so Mannister was busy answering innumerable
  questions, and receiving congratulations on his escape. It was one o'clock
  before he was able to go to his room. Before he undressed he took once more
  that sheet of writing paper from his pocket-book, and ruled a line through
  the name of John Dykes!</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-06"
     id="ch-06"></a>VI. A WOMAN INTERVENES</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Cosmopolitan</i>, Apr 1908</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was a little after two o'clock in the morning when
  Mannister stepped out of the caf&eacute;, where the air was stifling, into the cool
  sweetness of the spring twilight. Behind him was the gay music of the little
  red-coated orchestra, the dulcet cries of the mesdemoiselles whom he had
  passed on his way down the stairs, the shouting of a coon dancer, the clatter
  and tinkle of glasses and crockery. It was the night world of Paris who
  supped! And before him, the cool dark streets, the sense of cleanliness that
  one feels who escapes from such a miasma into the open air. Mannister stood
  for a moment bare-headed upon the pavement, and the commissionnaire hastened
  to his side.</p>

  <p>"<i>Voiture pour monsieur</i>?" he commanded with a bow.</p>

  <p>Mannister held up his hand.</p>

  <p>"<i>Voiture ordinaire</i>," he corrected, and very nearly paid with his
  life for the five francs he saved.</p>

  <p>The crazy old taximeter lumbered down the hill. Mannister took off his
  hat, laid it on the seat by his side, and leaning back amongst the cushions,
  lit a cigarette. The road from the <i>Montmartre</i> to the
  <i>Continental</i> was one which he had taken many a time. He was somewhat
  surprised when the <i>cocher</i> left the main thoroughfare and took one of
  the turns to the right. He leaned forward in his seat a little curiously, and
  again fortune was with him. From behind the carriage a dark form had sprung
  up and made a vicious blow with some shortly held swinging weapon at the
  place where Mannister's head had been. The coachman, who was in the grasp of
  another assailant, was yelling that he was murdered, and Mannister, whose
  brain moved swiftly, realized that this was probably one of those attacks by
  <i>apaches</i>, whose doings had been keeping the French Press busy during
  the last few weeks. He had no weapon, nor did he require any. The man who was
  scrambling over the back of the carriage with a knife now gleaming in his
  hand, went down into the roadway with a sickening thud, as Mannister's fist
  crashed into his face. His companion, who had sprung into the carriage, aimed
  one blow at Mannister with his knife, and then ducking his head, ran. The
  third man, who was wrestling with the coachman, finding himself deserted,
  leaped to the ground and also tore off. Mannister, whose blood was up, leaped
  out on to the pavement and would have followed his flying assailants, but the
  <i>cocher</i>, also descending, grabbed him by the arm.</p>

  <p>"They will only lead you into their haunts, monsieur!" he exclaimed. "They
  will murder you there! Get in, get in! We will drive fast."</p>

  <p>"I should like to know," Mannister said, "what the devil you mean by
  making this turn."</p>

  <p>"It is the nearest way, monsieur, and the stones are slippery along the
  Rue Pigalle," the <i>cocher</i> declared. "Jump in, monsieur, quickly. They
  will return, these assassins."</p>

  <p>Mannister reluctantly obeyed, the <i>cocher</i> whipped up his horse into
  a gallop, and they completed the journey to the <i>Hotel Continental</i>
  without further misadventure. But Mannister had found something to think
  about. This was the second time a night attack had been made upon him during
  his three days' stay in Paris!...</p>

  <p>He reported the affair next morning at police head-quarters, and had the
  satisfaction of receiving a great many polite assurances from a very
  regretful and very much uniformed personage. Afterwards, as the morning was
  brilliantly fine, he walked down the Boulevard and sat for a few moments
  outside the <i>Caf&eacute; de la Paix</i>. He had been there perhaps for five
  minutes when he felt a touch on his arm. He looked quickly up and saw
  Polsover standing by his chair.</p>

  <p>"I thought," Polsover said, "that I would give you the satisfaction of
  seeing me. Look! It is your work! D&mdash;n you!"</p>

  <p>Polsover was in rags. He was the sort of person whom a gendarme would have
  arrested on sight for speaking to a well-dressed stranger. He was unshaven,
  and he had lost at least a couple of stones in weight. His cheeks were white,
  and in his eyes was the gleam of the hunted animal.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," Mannister said shortly.</p>

  <p>"I am not allowed to," Polsover answered bitterly. "The gendarmes in this
  neighbourhood are down on me."</p>

  <p>Mannister rose languidly to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Follow me," he said shortly.</p>

  <p>At the corner of the Rue Scribe he paused at a large clothing store, and
  beckoned Polsover to follow him in.</p>

  <p>"You will supply this person," he said to the man who came forward to wait
  upon him, "with a complete outfit of clothes. Here are two hundred francs.
  The change I shall call for in a couple of hours."</p>

  <p>Then he turned to Polsover.</p>

  <p>"They will make you respectable here," he said. "When they have done with
  you come to the American bar of the <i>Hotel Chatham</i>. I shall wait there
  for you."</p>

  <p>Polsover stood like a man in a dream, and Mannister walked out of the shop
  and crossed the street. An hour afterwards, as he sat before one of the small
  tables in the bar of the Chatham, Polsover entered, metamorphosed, with
  something restored of his original carriage and bearing as he felt himself
  again in the garb of civilized men. Nevertheless he was curiously changed,
  thinner, and aged, grey about the temples, and with the spring gone from his
  walk. Mannister watched him approach, noticing all these things with
  unchanged face.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," he said. "You will take something to drink?"</p>

  <p>"Scotch whiskey and soda," Polsover answered. "I have been nearly poisoned
  with cheap drinks for the last few months. Be thankful that you do not know
  what it is to drink their brandy at the caf&eacute;s where I have been dining."</p>

  <p>Mannister gave an order to the barman and turned to his companion.</p>

  <p>"What the devil have you done this for, Mannister?" Polsover asked
  abruptly. "Are there some further refinements of torture you have it in your
  mind to use against me, or do you think that I have come down low enough even
  for you?"</p>

  <p>Mannister yawned slightly.</p>

  <p>"Don't be melodramatic," he said. "I detest it. I was quite content to let
  you go to the devil. When I saw you this afternoon at the <i>Caf&eacute; de la
  Paix</i>, however, the whim seized me to pull you back for a day or so at any
  rate. You might be useful to me."</p>

  <p>Polsover leaned a little across the table.</p>

  <p>"You never spoke a truer word," he said. "I might be useful to you. In
  fact I might save your life."</p>

  <p>"Is it in any particular danger?" Mannister asked.</p>

  <p>"Well," Polsover answered, helping himself with trembling fingers to a
  cigarette, "I should say that it was."</p>

  <p>Mannister appeared pleasantly interested.</p>

  <p>"I was right, then," he declared. "There was something in these two
  attacks. My friend," he continued, "you are interesting me. You talk about
  saving my life. I have had to do that twice for myself within the last two
  days, I might almost say hours."</p>

  <p>"Apaches?" Polsover asked.</p>

  <p>Mannister nodded.</p>

  <p>"Two night attacks," he said. "I put them down, of course, to the usual
  thing, but since your last remark I have begun to doubt it, especially as
  they seem to go for my person rather more than for my belongings."</p>

  <p>"The attacks were inspired," Polsover answered. "I can tell you that, and
  I can tell you by whom."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," Mannister remarked, "that it might be worth your while
  to do so."</p>

  <p>Polsover leaned across the table still further, and his voice dropped till
  it was almost a whisper.</p>

  <p>"You came back to England, Mannister," he said, "a deeply wronged man, and
  I do not know who can blame you that you set yourself deliberately out to
  revenge yourself upon those who had treated you disgracefully. Four, or is it
  five of us, you have pretty well broken upon the wheel, and yet the man in
  whose brain was hatched that scheme against you, goes so far untouched.
  Why?"</p>

  <p>"You mean Colin Stevens?" Mannister asked calmly.</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"His turn may come," Mannister said. "It may come before long."</p>

  <p>"You are in Paris," Polsover said, "because you know that he is here. You
  have come in search of him."</p>

  <p>"Possibly," Mannister admitted.</p>

  <p>"He guesses it," Polsover continued. "You see he has met you more than
  half way."</p>

  <p>"You mean," Mannister remarked, "that these attacks&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He is hand in hand," Polsover interrupted, "with several of the greatest
  criminals in Paris. He can do what he likes with some of these night gangs,
  who rob whom they please and defy the police."</p>

  <p>"Where is Stevens now?" Mannister asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"He was at Chantilly yesterday," Polsover said slowly. "He will be in
  Paris tonight."</p>

  <p>"Are you one of his creatures?" Mannister asked.</p>

  <p>"Not I," Polsover answered. "I went to him for alms, and he tossed me a
  ten franc piece and told me to go to the devil. I am not his man, or I should
  not have told you what I have told you."</p>

  <p>Mannister nodded.</p>

  <p>"I shall see Colin Stevens to-night," he said, "and he may find that the
  time has come for our accounts to be squared. As for you, you had better go
  back to England."</p>

  <p>"How can I?" Polsover exclaimed bitterly. "My partners paid the six
  thousand pounds and said that I had gone abroad for a holiday. It was the
  only way they could save the firm's reputation."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," Mannister interrupted. "You can return from your holiday and
  pay back the six thousand pounds. You may remember that my profit on that
  little deal with you amounted to something like sixty thousand, so I can
  spare you the odd six."</p>

  <p>He took a cheque-book from his pocket and wrote out a cheque rapidly,
  passing it across the table to Polsover.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean this, Mannister?" Polsover stammered.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool," Mannister replied. "I am not giving you the money. I am
  not afflicted by a sudden spasm of generosity. You've sold me information,
  and I've bought it cheap. I knew all about Atruscans. I knew very well that I
  was giving you a thousand pounds for something that was nearer worth one
  hundred thousand. If you think I'm generous, tear the cheque up if you like.
  If you are not a fool you'll take it back to London and make friends with
  your partners. There's only one thing, mind. If you try to thank me I'll stop
  payment of it. I hate humbug. Now," he continued, rising, "I think that I
  will go to Henri's bar and look for Colin Stevens."</p>

  <p>Polsover, too, rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"He goes in fear of you," he said, "and he goes armed."</p>

  <p>Mannister smiled as he rose and took up his hat and stick.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, "that our friend is getting a little
  old-fashioned. When I am prepared to talk, it will not be arms that will save
  him."</p>

  <p>Mannister turned into the Rue Danau, but he did not at once make his way
  to Henri's bar. He entered, instead, a suite of offices, and held a brief
  interview with the small grey-haired man who sat at a bare desk in a bare
  room at the top of the building, and whose plate announced that he was a
  private agent unrivalled in the detection of criminals, erring wives, and
  runaway children. Afterwards he took a <i>fiacre</i> to the <i>Caf&eacute; des
  Ambassadeurs</i>, and asked for the chief <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>.</p>

  <p>"I want," he explained, "to see your plan of the tables for dinner
  to-night."</p>

  <p>The <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> handed a chair to Mannister and brought the
  plan, together with the menu and a wine card.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur would doubtless desire to order some dinner," he suggested
  blandly.</p>

  <p>Mannister pointed to a table for two in the front row.</p>

  <p>"I want this table," he said.</p>

  <p>The <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> was in despair, but it was impossible. That
  table was already engaged, also the one next to it. An excellent place on the
  second row, or a corner table in the front row, if Monsieur desired! But
  Monsieur checked him.</p>

  <p>"Look here," Mannister said, slipping a twenty franc piece into his hand,
  "I want that table for a special reason, to please madame, you understand?
  Give it me, and serve me my dinner yourself, and there shall be two more of
  these at the close of the evening."</p>

  <p>The <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> was only human. He disappeared into the bureau,
  and returned, with his face wreathed in smiles.</p>

  <p>"It shall be as Monsieur desires," he announced. "The table was engaged
  for an excellent client, but he does not know its exact location. And for the
  dinner?"</p>

  <p>Mannister took out a heavy gold pencil, and wrote with the care of a man
  who is proposing for himself a dinner <i>de luxe</i>, a list of dishes which
  commanded the respect even of the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> himself. Then he
  added the wine and a few further particulars and departed, walking up the
  Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es until he came to a turn to the right.</p>

  <p>Here he walked for a few yards down the street, rang the bell at a
  handsome suite of apartments, and was instantly admitted.</p>

  <p>"Will you take my card," he asked, "to Madame de Modina?"</p>

  <p>"Madame does not receive this afternoon," the servant remarked
  hesitatingly.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell Madame that I am an old friend," Mannister said, "and that
  I have come from England to see her. It will be an affair of five minutes
  only, but she will always be grateful to me for coming. I have news for
  her."</p>

  <p>The maid tripped away, and returned after a few minutes' absence.</p>

  <p>"Madame will receive Monsieur," she announced, with a smile. "Will you be
  pleased to come this way."</p>

  <p>Mannister laid down his hat and stick, and followed her into a small
  reception-room. A woman, typically French&mdash;or was there, perhaps, some
  dash of Spanish blood in her veins which accounted for the pale cheeks and
  blue-black hair&mdash;half rose from a couch and looked towards him
  inquiringly. Mannister bowed, and waited till the servant who had admitted
  him had left the room.</p>

  <p>"Madame de Modina," he said, "my name is Mannister. It is doubtless
  unknown to you."</p>

  <p>The lady, somewhat impressed by Mannister's appearance, murmured her
  regrets and pointed to a chair.</p>

  <p>"I fear," Mannister continued, "that I shall not greatly recommend myself
  to you when I say that I was once a friend of Monsieur Colin Stevens."</p>

  <p>She leaned a little towards him. The change in her expression was
  unmistakable.</p>

  <p>"Once a friend?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>Mannister bowed.</p>

  <p>"It is because I can say that," he answered, "that I am here."</p>

  <p>The woman's face was distorted with a sudden fit of passion. She sat
  upright upon the couch and stamped upon the floor with her high heeled shoes.
  She leaned forward toward Mannister, and there was something almost tragic in
  her expression.</p>

  <p>"How do you dare, sir," she exclaimed, "to come here and to mention to me
  that man's name!"</p>

  <p>"Because," Mannister answered, "I thought that it would interest you to
  know that to-night he is dining at the <i>Caf&eacute; des Ambassadeurs</i> with
  Mademoiselle de Fleurier."</p>

  <p>She sprang to her feet and dashed to the ground the book which she had
  been reading.</p>

  <p>"It has come to that, then!" she exclaimed fiercely. "He will dine in
  public with her!"</p>

  <p>"It has come to that," Mannister answered.</p>

  <p>"And you?" she asked, turning suddenly upon him, "what business is it of
  yours?"</p>

  <p>"I do not understand why you, a stranger, come here to tell me this."</p>

  <p>"Madame," Mannister answered, "I come out of no kindness to you. I come
  because the man Stevens is my enemy, and because I know that it will give him
  no pleasure to find you dining at the next table to-night when he parades his
  new conquest."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she asked sullenly.</p>

  <p>"That if you will give me the honour of being my guest at dinner
  to-night," Mannister said, "the table which I have engaged at the <i>Caf&eacute; des
  Ambassadeurs</i> is curiously enough next to the one where Colin Stevens and
  Mademoiselle de Fleurier will sit."</p>

  <p>The woman walked the length of the room and back. One saw now that it was
  not time but grief which had written lines into her face and stolen the
  colour from her cheeks. She was a young woman, but she was suffering.</p>

  <p>"At what hour, Monsieur," she asked, "will you call for me?"</p>

  <p>"At eight o'clock," Mannister answered. "We shall do well to be there
  first."<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Mannister, although his back was toward the entrance, knew very well the
  exact moment when Colin Stevens and the lady who was his guest entered the
  restaurant. Two courses had passed untouched by the woman who sat opposite to
  him, with her eyes fixed upon the doorway. The dash of carmine upon her lips
  seemed to make even more startling the dead whiteness of her cheeks. Her
  black eyes seemed unnaturally large and bright. People looked at her and
  admired. Of her type she was surely wonderful. But when Mademoiselle de
  Fleurier rustled in, there was a little murmur of half stifled admiration. In
  her wonderful lace gown and picture hat, a rope of pearls about her neck, her
  blonde hair faultlessly arranged, the blush of youth upon her cheeks, she was
  certainly a companion to be proud of. Colin Stevens, dark and tall, with
  streaks of grey in his hair, and lines about his worn face, nevertheless held
  himself like a young man, as preceded by the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> they took
  their seats at the little table, which by his foresight was almost smothered
  with pink roses. Her back was towards Mannister, whom Stevens had not
  recognized. It was not until several minutes after their entrance that
  Stevens, glancing around him for the first time, was aware of his neighbours.
  Mademoiselle de Fleurier leaned across the table and touched his hand
  affectionately.</p>

  <p>"You are ill, <i>mon ami</i>," she asked, "or is it a ghost that you
  see?"</p>

  <p>A ghost! It was worse than that, Stevens thought, as he raised his glass
  to his lips and drank. Down the long avenues of his ill-spent life they came
  pell-mell in headlong procession, the ghosts of wronged women, of mis-spent
  hours, of friends deceived. It was an epitome of all these which seemed to
  look at him from the dark, sombre eyes of the woman a few feet away. For a
  moment his courage faltered.</p>

  <p>"The place is hot," he muttered, half rising.</p>

  <p>She laughed softly and pulled him down.</p>

  <p>"Foolish!" she murmured. "Why, we are out of doors here. Look across at
  the trees. See how cool and green they are in the lamplight. There is no
  place so cool as this in Paris. Drink some more wine. You are over-tired
  perhaps."</p>

  <p>She laughed into his eyes, and Stevens sat down in his chair prepared to
  face he knew not what. All this time Mannister had not looked at him, and yet
  in the face of his companion he judged something of what was passing.</p>

  <p>"Our friend, I fear," he murmured, "will enjoy his dinner none the better
  for finding us so near."</p>

  <p>She smiled at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"One cannot tell," she murmured. "He calls himself an epicure in
  sensations. Even this one may appeal to him&mdash;to make love to the woman
  he adores, a few yards away from the one he has discarded. We shall see."</p>

  <p>She ate little, always watching her companion's plate anxiously. Mannister
  judged that she was in a hurry to depart, and humoured her. She declined
  coffee, and sent early for the vestiaire. Mannister himself arranged about
  her shoulders a wonderful black lace cloak. Her right hand he noticed she
  kept free. Was there something clutched between the fingers? He would not
  look. It was not his business. They passed out, Mannister, with a word of
  apology, leading the way and waiting for her at the turn. He passed Stevens
  without the flicker of an eyelid. Then he heard the rustling of her skirts
  cease, and turned round. Almost simultaneously the man's shriek rang through
  the place. The little scene was in its way dramatic enough. Stevens was still
  standing upon his feet, his face covered with a napkin which barely stifled
  his inhuman cries. Before him the woman stood, immovable, her scarlet lips
  pressed close together, her eyes still blazing with anger. From her
  outstretched hand the light fumes were still curling. A great brown hole was
  burnt in the tablecloth just below. Mademoiselle de Fleurier had fallen
  backwards, and lay fainting, with her head resting upon the next table. Every
  one in the restaurant was standing up. One who was a doctor came hurrying
  from the rear. Mannister went up to the woman who had been his companion and
  touched her arm.</p>

  <p>"You had better come away," he said. "They have sent for the police."</p>

  <p>She flung his arm away.</p>

  <p>"What do I care for the police!" she answered. "I want to see him
  suffer."</p>

  <p>Mannister turned on his heel with a little shiver.</p>

  <p>"If I had known that the woman was such a fiend!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, on his way back to the hotel he drew from his pocket-book a
  sheet of paper, and with firm fingers drew a line through the name of Colin
  Stevens.</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Cosmopolitan</i>, May 1908</h3>

  <p class="first">EVEN Luigi paused before their table on his way down the
  room, and looked from one to the other in some surprise.</p>

  <p>"You are not very well this evening, Mr. Hambledon," he said. "I am very
  sorry. And Mr. Jacobs, too. He is very thin. You must come here to dine more
  often. It is the grippe, yes! All my customers have the grippe. Soon there
  will be no one at all who comes to eat."</p>

  <p>The <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> passed on to greet some newly arriving guests,
  and Hambledon and Jacobs exchanged quick glances.</p>

  <p>"Do I really look bad, Hambledon?" Jacobs asked.</p>

  <p>"Rotten!" Hambledon declared. "You look scared to death."</p>

  <p>"And I back you've lost a stone the last few months," Jacobs declared, a
  little viciously. "I never saw a man gone off so."</p>

  <p>Hambledon's white fingers trembled a little as he clutched his
  wine-glass.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it enough to shatter a man's nerves?" he asked hoarsely, "this
  cursed waiting for something, and all the time we don't know what! Here's
  Sophy coming. Darned if she hasn't got more pluck than any of us!"</p>

  <p>Sophy de la Mere swept into the room, followed by a couple of her youthful
  adorers. She was carrying a tiny little dog and she was wearing a new and
  wonderful hat. She stopped to shake hands with the two men, looking from one
  to the other scornfully.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" she asked. "Nerves gone wrong?"</p>

  <p>Hambledon shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"We all haven't your pluck," he confessed. "You've heard about Colin?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, and her face for a moment was grave.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" she answered. "It's a hideous thing to think of, and I am not going
  to spoil my dinner by talking about it. I always said that Colin would come
  to grief with some of these foreign women. He was altogether too fond of
  intrigue."</p>

  <p>The two men exchanged glances. Perhaps she had not heard.</p>

  <p>"You know whose hand was at the back of it?" Hambledon whispered. "You
  know who was this Madame de Modina's companion on the night she did it, who
  it was who reserved the table next to Stevens', and who took her there?"</p>

  <p>Sophy de la Mere shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You do not mean&mdash;?" she gasped, with sudden apprehension.</p>

  <p>"It was Mannister," Hambledon declared. "It was he who stood in the
  background and pulled the strings."</p>

  <p>For a moment she was paler. Then she laughed a little unnaturally.</p>

  <p>"That leaves only us three, then," she declared. "Upon my word it is
  getting a little uncanny."</p>

  <p>She spoke bravely enough, but even she shivered when Mannister bowed
  before her.</p>

  <p>"Is this a conspiracy of three?" he asked, smiling genially at them. "You
  seem to be discussing some awful deed."</p>

  <p>Hambledon sat down heavily in his seat, and little Jacobs clutched at the
  tablecloth, but Sophy de la Mere, after her first start, faced him bravely
  enough.</p>

  <p>"I have just been told about poor Colin," she said. "It was rather a shock
  to me."</p>

  <p>Mannister shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It was a most unfortunate occurrence," he said, "but better men than he
  have suffered for making love to two women at the same time. One must pay for
  one's luxuries, you know. Don't you agree with me, Hambledon?"</p>

  <p>"One has always to pay, of course," Hambledon muttered, "but it was a
  great price. They say that he is blind for life, and that he has sworn never
  to be seen upon the streets."</p>

  <p>"The streets will be the purer then," Mannister answered calmly. "I am
  afraid that I am not a sentimentalist. I have yet to find the man or the
  woman who knew Colin Stevens and was not the worse for it."</p>

  <p>Sophy de la Mere patted her dog's head for a moment, and looked absently
  up the room to where her two admirers were sitting.</p>

  <p>"Justice," she said, "is sometimes cruel, and justice seems to have been
  rather busy amongst us lately, Mr. Mannister. Let me see. There is Colin
  Stevens, blind and disfigured for life. Polsover, disgraced and exiled.
  Traske, robbed of an heiress and a chance of reformation, cleaning boots at a
  Toronto railway station. Then there is John Dykes, degenerated into a burglar
  and dead&mdash;temporary insanity, the jury said, but it was very nearly
  <i>felo de se</i>. Sinclair, gone God knows where. Rundermere, starving at a
  gambling hell in Cairo. Justice indeed seems to have been rather busy amongst
  our friends just lately&mdash;or should you call it retribution!"</p>

  <p>Mannister smiled thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he remarked, "we have been unfortunate. Still, you and our
  friends Hambledon and Jacobs here, remain."</p>

  <p>Sophy de la Mere looked him squarely in the face.</p>

  <p>"For how long?" she answered. "Whose turn is it next?"</p>

  <p>Mannister sighed.</p>

  <p>"My difficulties," he murmured, "are enough, without adding to them by
  putting you on your guard."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, "I am ready to take my chance. Luck has gone your way so
  far, but it may change. I am not going to spoil my dinner by wondering what
  is going to happen to me before to-morrow evening."</p>

  <p>She nodded, and swept up the room. Mannister looked after her
  admiringly.</p>

  <p>"A wonderful woman that," he murmured. "By-the-bye, what became of that
  little affair of hers with some young man?"</p>

  <p>"His guardian warned him off," Hambledon answered. "Are you going to dine
  with us, Mannister? We've only just begun."</p>

  <p>"I shall be delighted," Mannister answered. "To tell you the truth, I am
  glad to have the opportunity of a chat. You see," he added, studying the
  menu, "the well of my imagination is running dry. As you remarked a short
  time ago, there are you two left and Sophy. Take your case, Hambledon. Upon
  my word, I cannot imagine what unexpected avalanche of trouble would crush
  you most gracefully. Or you, Jacobs," he continued. "You have not much money,
  no character, and little position. I know of no one of whom you are fond
  except yourself, and nothing which you care for except the acquisition of
  money, in which, by-the-bye, you have not been over fortunate. You two
  present difficulties."</p>

  <p>"Then for Heaven's sake let us alone!" Jacobs exclaimed. "You've scared us
  nearly out of our wits. Be satisfied with that. As for my share of your
  beastly trust money, I lost it long ago. The whole thing did me no good."</p>

  <p>"The money," Mannister declared, having composed the menu to his liking,
  and scribbling it out with a heavy gold pencil, "is after all of no great
  account; but there were the other things, you see, my friends, there were the
  other things to be taken into account. By-the-bye, this is excellent caviare.
  Did you try it, you fellows?"</p>

  <p>"No!" Hambledon answered, gruffly. "We're not taking caviare at five
  shillings a time, Ernest and I. Things are none too good in the city."</p>

  <p>"They will be worse to-morrow," Mannister remarked equably. "There is a
  great slump on the American Stock Exchange. I met a man outside who had just
  received a cable."</p>

  <p>Jacobs sighed a little wearily.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "we can't stand many more of them, that's a fact. I heard
  'Grand Trunks' were going to fall. We don't touch them on our market,
  though."</p>

  <p>"The Stock Exchange," Mannister remarked, sipping his wine with the air of
  a satisfied connoisseur, "is an extraordinary institution. You two are always
  grumbling, yet I understand that both of you make a fair living at it. You,
  my young friend," he added, turning to Jacobs, "have had, I understand, only
  four years at it. For such a short time I should say that you had been
  moderately successful."</p>

  <p>"It depends upon what you call success," Jacobs answered. "What satisfies
  some men would not satisfy me. To get on quickly, one must save money every
  week, every month."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," Mannister assented, "yet think how much better your position
  is than say a clerk in a warehouse or drapery establishment. They have
  neither the chance to save money nor to make it. You, on the other hand, have
  both, and if you chance to lose it, it is other people's money and not your
  own."</p>

  <p>"There is something in that," Jacobs admitted, with a grin, "but you don't
  get many chances with other people's money. Once bit, twice shy, you
  know."</p>

  <p>Mannister nodded.</p>

  <p>"Were you thinking," he asked, as their dinner drew toward a close, "of
  going anywhere this evening?"</p>

  <p>"I am off home," Hambledon answered. "My train leaves in half an
  hour."</p>

  <p>"I thought of turning in at a Music Hall," Jacobs declared, "the only
  thing to do at this hour of the evening."</p>

  <p>"I am glad," Mannister said, "that you have no serious engagements. I
  should like to take you for a short drive."</p>

  <p>Jacobs shrank a little back in his chair, and looked at Mannister in
  alarm. Somehow or other his words seemed prophetic. Hambledon leaned a little
  forward.</p>

  <p>"My train," he remarked, "goes at nine-forty."</p>

  <p>"You will have to leave very soon, then," Mannister remarked, "or you will
  lose it."</p>

  <p>Hambledon drew a little sigh of relief. At any rate this was a respite for
  him. Then he looked curiously at Jacobs, who seemed somehow to have grown
  smaller in his chair.</p>

  <p>"A drive?" he faltered, "but it is a wet night, quite wet out, I
  believe."</p>

  <p>"My carriage is a closed one," Mannister remarked pleasantly. "If you must
  go, Hambledon, good night! Don't bother about the bill. It's my turn
  to-night."</p>

  <p>Hambledon, with a moment's regret for the caviare, got up to go. Jacobs
  watched him with eyes that were full of dumb appeal.</p>

  <p>"Stay till the next train, Hambledon," he said. "Let's have another bottle
  here before we go out."</p>

  <p>Mannister shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No!" he said. "Hambledon is a family man, and must keep his engagements.
  You and I will just take a liqueur, Jacobs, and then we will go for our
  little drive."</p>

  <p>Jacobs made an effort to assert himself, but he spoke feebly and without
  conviction.</p>

  <p>"I am not your slave, Mr. Mannister," he said. "I do not want to go for a
  drive. I have an engagement for this evening."</p>

  <p>Mannister, who was sipping his liqueur, ignored his words absolutely. He
  called for the bill and paid it.</p>

  <p>"If you are quite ready," he said to Jacobs politely.</p>

  <p>"I am ready to leave," Jacobs answered, rising, "but I am going to the
  Alhambra. I promised to meet a client of mine in the promenade."</p>

  <p>"As you like," Mannister answered carelessly, "but I will drive you there.
  Won't you light another cigar before we go?"</p>

  <p>They made their way outside, and the commissionnaire called up Mannister's
  electric brougham. Even then Jacobs hesitated upon the pavement. He was more
  than half inclined to make a bolt for it.</p>

  <p>"I think if you don't mind I'll walk," he said. "I have had no exercise
  to-day and it is a fine evening."</p>

  <p>Mannister's hand grew a little heavier upon his shoulder, and Jacobs found
  himself without alternative save to enter the carriage. Mannister spoke a few
  words to the driver before entering. The carriage glided off citywards.</p>

  <p>"This is not the way to the Alhambra," Jacobs protested.</p>

  <p>"It is not," Mannister admitted. "The fact is we are going to pay a little
  call first."</p>

  <p>Jacobs made a sudden spring toward the door, but Mannister was too quick
  for him.</p>

  <p>"Sit still," he commanded, in an altered tone. "If you try to escape it
  will only be the worse for you."</p>

  <p>"I want to know at any rate where we are going," Jacobs protested
  doggedly.</p>

  <p>"You will find out very soon," Mannister answered. "You are going to call
  upon an old friend. You need not be alarmed. I will undertake that you
  receive a hearty welcome."</p>

  <p>"An old friend?" Jacobs repeated, incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Mannister answered. "I can assure you that he is looking
  forward very much to renewing his acquaintance with you."</p>

  <p>Jacobs for the time asked no more questions. He looked longingly out of
  the windows of the carriage, but he made no movement to escape. In his heart
  he knew very well that it was useless. They passed through the broader
  thoroughfares of the city, now almost deserted, and continued until they
  reached the Bethnal Green Road. Suddenly the carriage slowed up and came to a
  smooth stop. Mannister opened the door, and putting his arm through his
  companion's, invited him to descend.</p>

  <p>"Where on earth are we going to here?" Jacobs asked, as they stepped on to
  the pavement.</p>

  <p>In front of them was a shop with plate glass windows, filled with dummies
  in boy's clothing, and all the other paraphernalia of a ready-made tailoring
  establishment. The premises were closed, and shutters had been drawn over the
  entrance, but Mannister led the way to a side entrance, and knocked softly at
  the door. Jacobs looked about him in bewilderment. Suddenly his eyes caught
  the name stretched across the front of the shop in great gilt letters, and
  his knees seemed to give way beneath him. But for Mannister's arm he would
  have fallen.</p>

  <p>"No!" he cried, trying to draw back, "I will not go in here. Let me
  alone."</p>

  <p>The door was suddenly opened, and before he realized it Jacobs found
  himself inside, with the door fast closed behind them. They were in almost
  complete darkness until the man who had admitted them struck a light. His
  features were indiscernible. They could see only his broad back as he led the
  way.</p>

  <p>"Come into the office," he said, and once more the knees of the young man
  whom Mannister was half dragging along, seemed to give way beneath him. They
  passed along a small passage, where the atmosphere was heavy with the odour
  of piled-up cloth, and into a smaller room, where there was a sudden glare of
  light. Then the man who had been their guide wheeled round. Jacobs, whom
  Mannister's arm no longer supported, staggered back against the wall, and
  stood there with ashen face and distended eyes.</p>

  <p>"So it is you!" he began. "You scamp! You&mdash;hound!"</p>

  <p>No one answered. Mannister, lounging easily against the mahogany counter
  on one side of the room, glanced from one to the other of the two remaining
  figures in the little tableau. The man who had admitted them, tall and
  powerful, with curly black hair and hooked nose, was glaring at Jacobs as
  though only waiting to recover his breath before he rushed upon him. Jacobs,
  speechless and terrified, was gazing towards him with fascinated eyes, a
  hopeless, nerveless being. It was Mannister who spoke first.</p>

  <p>"I think, my dear Jacobs," he said, "I mentioned that we were going to
  call upon an old friend of yours. I can see that you recognize Mr. Goldberg,
  and I am sure that Mr. Goldberg has not forgotten you. I fear that there are
  several little matters which should have been adjusted before between you
  two. Perhaps you may find this opportunity a convenient one for discussing
  them."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to discuss," Jacobs faltered, with white lips. "I do not
  know this man. It is a mistake."</p>

  <p>Goldberg stepped forward with an oath. Mannister held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Permit me," he said, "to remind our young friend here of the
  circumstances, which certainly do require a little explanation from him. Nine
  years ago I think it was that our young friend here entered Mr. Goldberg's
  employ as errand boy, or in some similar capacity. Our young friend was
  industrious, and his position improved. Five years ago you were, I believe,"
  he remarked, turning to Jacobs, "appointed cashier of the firm, and also your
  proposals of marriage to Mr. Goldberg's daughter were accepted. A very
  excellent position, I am sure. It is a pity that those city friends of yours
  should have turned your head and made you dissatisfied with such suitable,
  and I am sure pleasant surroundings."</p>

  <p>"We have had enough talking," Goldberg interrupted. "It is my turn, and I
  have some things to say."</p>

  <p>Mannister stretched out his hand.</p>

  <p>"The evening is young, my dear Mr. Goldberg," he said, "and our young
  friend's memory is bad. Let me remind him of the rest. Let me remind him of
  that morning when he disappeared, taking with him two hundred and
  eighty-seven pounds, fifteen shillings, and leaving behind a small but rising
  ready-made clothing business without a cashier, and, I fear, a very
  disconsolate young lady. It was an ungallant thing to do, Mr. Jacobs, very
  ungallant. Did you think that a simple change of name and a clean-shaven face
  was sufficient to keep this past buried for ever?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, but he has been cunning!" Goldberg declared, keeping his black eyes
  still fixed upon his victim. "He has kept very far away from all the places
  where he could meet me or any of my friends. Once he was a devout Jew, he
  went always to Synagogue. When he was engaged to my daughter he was pious all
  the time. And now he makes moneys at the Stock Exchange, and my daughter is
  not good enough for him. What about that two hundred and eighty-seven pounds,
  fifteen shillings, eh?"</p>

  <p>"You shall have your money," Jacobs said, falteringly. "I meant to pay you
  back. It was only a loan."</p>

  <p>"You meant to pay me back!" Goldberg repeated, with a gleam of his white
  teeth. "When, I wonder? Not till you were caught! I think that if this
  gentleman had not come and asked me a few questions about a cashier named
  Aaron Levinstein, I think that I should never have seen you again, Aaron, you
  or that money."</p>

  <p>Mannister lit another cigarette and took up his hat.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "that I will leave you two to settle your differences.
  I have no doubt but that you will be able to arrive at a reasonable
  solution."</p>

  <p>Goldberg, with an ugly smile, stretched out his hand, and took from the
  mantelpiece by his side a short whip. Jacobs clung to Mannister's arm.</p>

  <p>"I will not be left here alone with him," he called out. "He will murder
  me. Mr. Mannister, do you hear? I will pay him the money, but I will not be
  left alone with him."</p>

  <p>Mannister thrust him back, and paused with his hand upon the door.</p>

  <p><a id="pic7"

  </div>

  <p>"My young friend," he said, "you will pay him the money back, but you will
  also receive from the hands of Mr. Goldberg the thrashing you deserve, and
  you will marry his daughter, or else you will go to prison! Good night!"</p>

  <p>Mannister closed the door behind him and walked down the passage. As he
  struck a match to let himself out, he heard a shrill cry of pain from the
  room which he had left. Outside on the pavement he drew a paper and a pencil
  from his pocket, and deliberately drew a thick black line through one of the
  last of the names on the list.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-08"
     id="ch-08"></a>VIII. THE MAKING OF HAMBLEDON</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Cosmopolitan</i>, Jun 1908</h3>

  <p class="first">THE round table at Luigi's was laid for four, but Mannister
  sat there alone.</p>

  <p>He studied the menu without interest, and ordered his dinner mechanically.
  Then he leaned back in his seat, and his eyes for the moment travelled
  through the opposite walls into a distant corner of the world, and the ghosts
  leapt up like puppets, to bend over and deride. Mannister was very bored and
  very weary. As he sat there he realized that he was a man to whom fortune in
  all material ways had latterly been most kind, but whose life was slipping
  away in a somewhat dreary procession of empty days and empty weeks. His lips
  curled a little bitterly as he realized how little indeed he valued the life
  which flowed in his veins and beat in his pulses. The money in his bank lay
  idle, the world's many pleasures remained untasted. He lived because he was
  alive. There was no purpose nor any happiness in the slowly passing days. The
  task which he had set himself when the iron of suffering had entered his soul
  and made of his life a wreck, was already almost achieved. He thought of them
  one by one, these men who had wrought this evil thing against him, and he
  knew that the misfortunes which had befallen them were just and well
  deserved. And now even this interest in his life was passing away. Two only
  were left. Already he was weary to death of the executioner's knife. In all
  his life there remained no other purpose, he could think of no pleasure which
  would cause his pulses to thrill, no task which might make his heart beat the
  lighter.</p>

  <p>And he was lonely! Somehow the sight of the empty table at which he sat
  struck a chill in his heart. It was his own hand which had thrust to their
  doom these quondam companions of his, and there was not one of them whom for
  a moment he regretted. And yet he found his solitude distasteful, typical of
  his life itself. He was impatient with the weakness which made even the
  faintest sense of loneliness possible. And yet the empty chairs round this
  table spoke to him of the days when he had been like other men, with the cup
  of life pressed hard to his lips, and joy in his heart. Had he indeed passed
  outside all alone? Was his to be for all time a life of lonely days, of
  weariness, of solitude?</p>

  <p>Sophy de la Mere saw him on her way up the room, and stopped and turned
  back. She pointed to the empty places, and she laughed at him softly, and
  without fear.</p>

  <p>"You remind me," she said, "of a child who has thrown his toys out of the
  window, and who sits on the nursery floor bewailing his loneliness."</p>

  <p>He smiled, and patted the head of her little dog.</p>

  <p>"The toys," he answered, "are not all destroyed."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You must really tell me," she said, "what it is that you have done to
  Ernest Jacobs. I am beginning to suspect that you may have a sense of humour.
  I saw him two nights ago in the pit at the Adelphi Theatre, sitting between a
  big, dark, Jewish-looking man and a girl, who must have been his
  daughter&mdash;sharp featured, with a terrible fringe. He looked as though he
  were wearing ready-made clothes and were trying to grow a moustache. If this
  is your doing it is the justice of Heaven. I never saw any one who looked so
  miserable and yet so thoroughly in touch with his surroundings."</p>

  <p>A rare gleam of humour flashed in Mannister's eyes.</p>

  <p>"I am a philanthropist," he declared. "I start out with terribly evil
  intentions, and in the end I simply induce people to revert to their normal
  state. Jacobs as a stockbroker and a man about town was a wretched poseur. As
  a partner in a retail clothing establishment, and husband to Miss Goldberg,
  he is in the position for which Providence intended him."</p>

  <p>"You are not only convincing," she declared, "but reassuring."</p>

  <p>"Do me the honour," he said, "to dine with me, and we will pursue the
  subject."</p>

  <p>She smiled, and seated herself at the table. Mannister was scornfully
  aware that her coming was a pleasure to him. He called a <i>ma&icirc;tre
  d'h&ocirc;tel</i> and supplemented his order. She drew off her gloves and leaned a
  little across the table towards him, her chin resting upon her clasped white
  hands.</p>

  <p>"Your latest statement," she remarked, "interests me. Of course you know
  that there are only Fred Hambledon and myself left. Now if I am going to be
  dealt with after the manner of Jacobs, that is to say put in my proper place
  in the world, let me hear your idea as to what that may be."</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"Forewarned is forearmed," he said. "Why should I give myself away?"</p>

  <p>She pushed up her veil so that her face was exposed.</p>

  <p>"Look at me," she said, and he obeyed. "What do you see?" she asked. "Be
  truthful!"</p>

  <p>"I see," he said, "the face of a woman who has known many things and
  suffered many things, and who is a little tired of them all."</p>

  <p>"Look again," she said.</p>

  <p>"How much shall I tell you?" he continued. "You have been beautiful, but
  you remain only charming. There are lines about your eyes and at the corners
  of your mouth. Life does not mean to you what it meant five or ten or fifteen
  years ago."</p>

  <p>"Life," she said, "will never mean anything to me again. Now you know why
  I sit here and talk lightly with you. It is not because I am not afraid.
  Nothing that you can say can wound me, nothing that you can do can harm me.
  Nothing, that is to say, unless you countermand your invitation to dinner,
  for I could not possibly afford myself all these good things which you have
  ordered."</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"The dinner," he said, "is a certainty. To tell you the truth I am
  indebted to you for coming. Have you ever known what it is to be lonely?"</p>

  <p>"I have been lonely for so many years," she said, "that I shall never be
  lonely any more. It is past."</p>

  <p>Mannister thought over her words as he sipped his wine.</p>

  <p>"You are a young woman still," he said.</p>

  <p>"I am forty-two," she answered, "and there is not a person in the world
  who cares two pins whether I live or die. The woman of forty-two who is loved
  has life before her, and all the happiness that life can hold. The woman who
  has reached my age without winning the love of any one, can never win
  anything. Her life is over."</p>

  <p>Mannister sipped his wine thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I am almost tempted," he said, "to play the part of consoler, to remind
  you that the spinning of time brings us always back again, some day or other,
  to those who have cared, but from whom we may have drifted away. New fires
  may not be lighted, but the old ones may leap again into flame."</p>

  <p>She laughed at him softly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know which is the more consoling," she said, "your Pommery or
  your philosophy. Between the two I am certainly getting curious. What
  terrible scheme have you been hatching in your brain against me?"</p>

  <p>"In your case," he answered, "one must reverse the ancient saying&mdash;'
  <i>Place aux dames</i>.' There still remains our friend Hambledon."</p>

  <p>Her lips curled scornfully.</p>

  <p>"There is just a question," she said, "whether he does exist. I think that
  he is very nearly frightened into his grave. They say that he never comes
  west of St. Paul's, never enters a restaurant, and has eschewed the music
  halls."</p>

  <p>"On my account?" Mannister asked.</p>

  <p>"Entirely," she answered. "He goes in terror of his life."</p>

  <p>Mannister smiled superciliously.</p>

  <p>"He never had the nerves of a rabbit," he said. "I shall be curious to see
  him. Isn't this&mdash;? Why, here he is!"</p>

  <p>It was not wonderful that Mannister failed to recognize the man who a
  little timidly had entered the room, and stood hesitating now a few feet away
  from their table. Hambledon was still in morning dress, and he was certainly
  in evil condition. He had grown thinner, so that his clothes hung about him
  loosely. He had ceased to be particular about his linen and the folding of
  his tie. Behind his gold spectacles his eyes were bloodshot, and he carried
  with him the faint nauseating odour of the man who is an habitual drinker.
  Mannister beckoned to him, and he came up to the table at once.</p>

  <p>"What the devil have you been doing to yourself?" Mannister demanded.</p>

  <p>"I have been ill&mdash;upset&mdash;a nervous break-down," Hambledon
  stammered. "I have been&mdash;d&mdash;n it all! you know what it is,
  Mannister!" he wound up abruptly. "Let me sit down and talk. My knees shake
  if I stand. Excuse me, Mrs. De la Mere. I did not recognize you at
  first."</p>

  <p>"Sit down," Mannister said shortly. "Will you have some wine?"</p>

  <p>Hambledon drank a glass off greedily.</p>

  <p>"You know what is the matter with me, Mannister," he said. "Haven't I seen
  them all go, one by one? There's Traske, somewhere down in Hell. Polsover, a
  fugitive and ruined. They told me he was back, but it can't be true. Stevens,
  Colin Stevens, in a hospital with a bandage on his face, and God help him
  when the time comes for him to take it off! Rundermere, starving in some
  dirty foreign place. Jacobs, little Ernie, you walked him off from this very
  spot, and never a soul has seen him since. Dykes, dead and buried with a
  bullet in his forehead. I have seen them all go, and I am the last. God help
  me, I am the last!"</p>

  <p>"You forget me," Sophy de la Mere said calmly.</p>

  <p>"You and I, then," Hambledon said. "There's no one else left. They're all
  gone. I wish to Heaven I'd lost every farthing I possessed in the world
  before I'd robbed you, Mannister."</p>

  <p>Mannister leaned back in his seat, and surveyed the other man
  contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"It was not the money, Hambledon," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>Hambledon clasped his hands and the tears stood in his eyes as he
  swore&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It was not I who schemed to get you out of the country. I had nothing to
  do with Sinclair and that part of it, I swear. It was Stevens who thought
  that out."</p>

  <p>"You were a party to it," Mannister said coldly.</p>

  <p>"I did not approve&mdash;I did not agree," Hambledon declared. "I swear
  that I did not. Ask Mrs. De la Mere. There's no one else left to ask."</p>

  <p>Mannister shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Let that go," he said. "Tell me why you have come here to-night like
  this."</p>

  <p>"I had not the heart to change," Hambledon said. "I have lost my pluck.
  Hang it all," he continued, "can't you see that I'm broken? What more do you
  want of me? You remember the man I was. Look at me now. I am fit for nothing
  but the scrap-heap. If you have anything planned in your mind against me,
  Mannister, go on with it, go on with it quickly. You may try your hardest,
  but I doubt whether you can do me any further evil."</p>

  <p>Mannister sipped his wine thoughtfully. His eyes lingered upon the man who
  sat on the other side of the table; there was no sympathy in his face, only a
  great contempt.</p>

  <p>"Your temperament is too elastic, Hambledon," he said drily. "If the fear
  of me were removed from you to-night, you would blossom out to-morrow a new
  man. I am not disposed to let you off so cheaply."</p>

  <p>Hambledon rose from his chair a little abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Was it to tell me this," he asked, "that you sent for me?"</p>

  <p>"Not entirely," Mannister answered. "I was curious to see you. You can go
  now if you like. You will hear from me again in a day or two."</p>

  <p>Hambledon spoke one last word before he turned away.</p>

  <p>"So far, Mannister," he said, leaning a little across the table, "the luck
  has been on your side, but it may change. Remember that it may change at any
  moment."</p>

  <p>He turned and left the restaurant. Mannister looked towards his companion
  with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe in luck, dear lady?" he asked.</p>

  </div>

  <p>"I do," she answered, "but I believe also in you. I have had a delightful
  dinner, but I am afraid that I must tear myself away now. I am going round to
  Peggy Lancaster's to play bridge."</p>

  <p>Mannister rose and bowed his adieux.</p>

  <p>"I imagine," he said, "that we shall meet again before long."</p>

  <p>She smiled at him gaily.</p>

  <p>"Whenever you please," she answered. "I at least am not afraid of you, and
  I have enjoyed my dinner immensely."</p>

  <p>Once more Mannister was alone. He ordered a liqueur, and lighting a
  cigarette, he sat for some time at the table. Then calling a waiter, he paid
  his bill and left the restaurant. From his pocket-book he took a small piece
  of paper and handed it up to the driver of his electric brougham.</p>

  <p>"Find out where this is," he said, "and drive me there. It is somewhere in
  Balham."</p>

  <p>Balham is a large neighbourhood, and the house which Mannister sought was
  in a very small street. Nevertheless they found it at last, after stopping
  several times for inquiries, and the carriage pulled up with a jerk in front
  of one of a tiny row of poor-looking houses. Mannister descended, and after
  looking up and down the street, rang the bell of the house opposite to him.
  There was some delay before it was answered, then the door was cautiously
  opened by a woman, whose face was invisible in the passage.</p>

  <p>"Is Mrs. Hambledon in?" Mannister asked.</p>

  <p>"I am Mrs. Hambledon," the woman answered.</p>

  <p>"I should be glad," Mannister said, "to have a few minutes' conversation
  with you."</p>

  <p>The woman looked at him in amazement, and then at the carriage which
  waited outside. Suddenly an idea occurred to her.</p>

  <p>"Has anything happened to&mdash;to my husband?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Mannister shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Nothing that I know of," he answered.</p>

  <p>"I have some business with you, however. Will you allow me to come in and
  talk to you for a few minutes?"</p>

  <p>She led the way into a small, poorly furnished sitting-room, and turned up
  the light. Mannister for the first time was able to see her distinctly. The
  unshaded gaslight was no kinder to her than the hand of time had been. She
  was thin and faded. Her face bore the impress of a constant anxiety. Her eyes
  were deep-set. Her dress was untidy, her appearance in no way prepossessing.
  Nevertheless Mannister felt that she was only the wreck of some other woman
  whose identity might well be lost.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Hambledon," Mannister said, "I have known your husband for a great
  many years. Lately I have made some inquiries concerning his habits and the
  manner of his life. It is because I am convinced that he is not behaving
  fairly to you and to his family that I have determined to intervene. I have
  some influence over your husband&mdash;we will call it influence, at any
  rate. May I ask if you know what his income is?"</p>

  <p>The woman's eyes were big with astonishment. She scarcely understood what
  all this might mean.</p>

  <p>"Between two and three hundred a year, he tells me," she answered. "He
  allows me three pounds a week to keep house on and look after the children.
  Sometimes," she added, after a moment's pause, "it is rather hard work."</p>

  <p>Mannister nodded.</p>

  <p>"He allows you," he repeated, "three pounds a week, and he pays, I
  imagine, for this house something like twenty-five pounds a year. And for
  your dress?"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes," she said, "he gives me a little extra, but as a rule I have
  to buy what I want out of the three pounds a week."</p>

  <p>"Your husband," Mannister said, "is not treating you well, Mrs. Hambledon.
  His income is nearer a thousand a year than three hundred pounds a year. I
  have some time ago been one of his associates, and I know something of the
  manner of his life, and I repeat that he is not treating you well."</p>

  <p>"If," she said, looking at Mannister fixedly, "you know what you are
  talking about, if there is any truth at all in what you say, then he has
  treated me like a devil. I was better off by far before I was married. I had
  a comfortable home then, and no anxieties. Now it is nothing but work and
  trouble from Monday morning to Saturday night. I would not mind that so
  much," she continued, "if there was any one to share it with me, but the
  children are too young to understand, and his business keeps him out always
  till ten or eleven o'clock, sometimes all night. That is," she added, after a
  moment's breathless pause, and with a sudden new light in her eyes, "if he
  tells me the truth!"</p>

  <p>Mannister looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Put on your hat, Mrs. Hambledon," he said, "and come with me."</p>

  <p>"Come with you! Where?" she repeated. "What for?"</p>

  <p>"I am going," Mannister said, "to make things quite clear to you, and then
  I am going to show you how to act so that you may have a different husband
  and a different home."</p>

  <p>The woman did not hesitate. She disappeared for a few moments, and
  returned dressed quietly enough, but with some remnants of gentility, for the
  street. Mannister placed her in the carriage and sat by her side. They drove
  almost in silence to a small block of flats near the Museum. Here Mannister
  assisted her to alight and whispered a question to the janitor, who shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"We have an appointment for ten o'clock," Mannister said. "Take us up into
  his rooms and let us wait."</p>

  <p>He slipped a half sovereign into the man's hand, who showed them at once
  into the lift. On the fourth floor he stepped out and opened the door of one
  of the flats. The man retreated, closing the door after him.</p>

  <p>"Why have you brought me here?" Mrs. Hambledon asked, looking around. "I
  do not understand."</p>

  <p>"You will see," Mannister remarked, "that this is a cosy little suite,
  small but comfortable. There is a bedroom in there, and a bathroom. The
  sitting-room is not perhaps, elaborate, but still it is well enough for a
  bachelor. Go into the bedroom for a minute and tell me whether you recognize
  any of the things you see there."</p>

  <p>She disappeared, and came back in a moment with white, scared face.</p>

  <p>"There are some of my husband's clothes there, and his shaving things,"
  she said. Mannister nodded.</p>

  <p>"Anything else?" he asked quietly.</p>

  <p>The woman covered her face with her handkerchief and sobbed. Mannister
  laid his hand gently upon her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"We are going to have all this changed," he said. "You must not worry.
  Life is made up of disappointments, you know. I dare say there are many worse
  in the world than your husband."</p>

  <p>She looked up at him again in a moment. "Tell me," she asked quietly,
  "what concern all this is of yours?"</p>

  <p>Mannister smiled.</p>

  <p>"In a few minutes," he said, "your husband will be here, and you may
  understand a little; you will never understand altogether. It is sufficient
  if I tell you that I think I can make your husband promise that there shall
  be no more of this sort of thing," he added, after a moment's pause.</p>

  <p>The woman sat down, and with her chin resting upon her hands, looked
  fixedly into the fireplace.</p>

  <p>"We have been married," she said, in dull, even tones, "eleven years. For
  the first year I was fairly happy, the second year things were a little
  different, and since then every year they have been worse. God knows what a
  struggle it has been lately. Fred has been home scarcely at all. We have
  never been away. I have not seen the inside of a theatre for five years. And
  all the time, all the time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She did not finish her sentence. Mannister said nothing. There was nothing
  which he could say.</p>

  <p>"I think," she began again in a moment, "that I would rather not have
  known. It was bad enough before, but now it is worse. If it were not for the
  children&mdash;" she added softly.</p>

  <p>Then of a sudden a key turned in the door and Hambledon entered. When he
  saw who it was that waited for him, he stood stock still, rooted to the
  ground with surprise. His wife rose slowly to her feet. Somehow or other she
  was no longer the poor faded creature whom Mannister had found. There was
  dignity as well as character in her attitude, and the calm level gaze which
  she turned upon him.</p>

  <p>"Shut the door, Hambledon," Mannister ordered.</p>

  <p>Hambledon obeyed like a man in a dream.</p>

  <p>"Now give me the key," Mannister continued.</p>

  <p>Again Hambledon obeyed. All the time he kept glancing furtively towards
  his wife.</p>

  <p>"I do not think," Mannister said quietly, "that this is a situation which
  calls for many explanations. With a view to adjusting the little difference
  that remains between us, Hambledon, I made certain inquiries with regard to
  you and the manner of your life. The result was that I discovered you to be
  one of those selfish brutes who deceives his wife as to his means, and lives
  in luxury himself, while he forces his family to subsist on a beggarly
  pittance. Your wife knows everything, Hambledon. She will forgive you on
  certain conditions. Three parts of your income is to be spent in maintaining
  a proper establishment for her and your children. This flat you do not enter
  again. Your spare time, whatever it is, with reasonable exceptions, is to be
  given to fulfilling your duties as a husband and a father. Your acceptance of
  these conditions settles the difference between us. If you refuse them, or
  your wife refuses to forgive you, that difference must be settled in another
  way."</p>

  <p>The man and the woman stood looking at one another. Dimly she seemed to
  understand that there was some danger with which her husband was threatened,
  and that it came from Mannister. She looked at him almost threateningly, and
  half held out her arms to her husband. Mannister turned away with a faint
  smile.</p>

  <p>"My terms, I see," he began.</p>

  <p>"Are accepted!" both the man and the woman declared.</p>

  <p>Mannister pointed to the door.</p>

  <p>"Let me suggest, then," he said, "that you take your wife round to a
  restaurant and have some supper. I will see to the shutting up of this place.
  And, Hambledon, remember I am not to be deceived."</p>

  <p>Mr. and Mrs. Hambledon left the place arm in arm. Mannister locked up, and
  descended a few minutes later with the key in his pocket. On his way back to
  his rooms, he drew out the list which he still carried, and drew a line
  through Hambledon's name. Then he looked reflectively at the sheet of paper,
  now worn with much folding. One by one those straight black lines seemed to
  tell their own story. Only one name remained, the name of Sophy de la
  Mere!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-09"
     id="ch-09"></a>IX. AT THE END OF THE JOURNEY</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Cosmopolitan</i>, Jul 1908</h3>

  <p class="first">"SINCE when," Mrs. De la Mere asked, "have you been your own
  chauffeur?"</p>

  <p>"Since I bought a car of my own," Mannister answered. "One must do
  something. I hate golf, I am too old for cricket. The sports I know anything
  of come later. This is interesting, at any rate, and one gets into the
  country easily."</p>

  <p>"Interesting?" she repeated. "I call it delightful! And you drive as
  though you knew all about it. I declare that I am not in the least
  nervous."</p>

  <p>Mannister did not reply, for they were still in the suburbs of London, and
  the great car which he was driving needed all his attention. But soon the
  tramway lines came to an end, the road broadened, they were passing from
  suburbanism to the country proper. Mrs. De la Mere leaned back amongst the
  cushions and half closed her eyes.</p>

  <p>"After all," she murmured, "I am sure that there is nothing more beautiful
  than the simple pleasures of life. What is it in the hedges that smells so
  sweet?"</p>

  <p>The west wind blew in their faces Mannister took off his cap and threw it
  behind to the chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"Why do we waste our time at Ranelagh and Richmond?" he remarked. "The
  Londoner's love of the country, after all, has something artificial about it.
  One likes groves and trees and flower-beds, but one loves the flavour of
  civilization with them all."</p>

  <p>"A basket chair on the lawn, and cucumber sandwiches with one's tea," Mrs.
  De la Mere murmured. "But this, at any rate, is the real thing."</p>

  <p>They rushed on through the fragrant air. It was a late warm day in spring.
  The violets were still in the hedges, and the early cowslips were showing in
  the meadows. Above their heads the birds were singing. Here and there an
  early butterfly fluttered across the honeysuckle-wreathed hedge.</p>

  <p>"It is years," Mrs. De la Mere murmured, "since I really felt that I was
  in the country. Do you know, I wonder, that I once lived in a village?"</p>

  <p>Mannister looked straight ahead down the white dusty road.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said. "I know that you did. I seem to have one of those
  wearisome memories that forget nothing. I remember the name of the village
  where you lived."</p>

  <p>They passed a hay-field, caught for a moment the delicious perfume of the
  falling grass, and heard the musical whirr of the mowing machines Then on
  again across a common, where the yellow gorse was budding, and far below a
  faint blue mist rose from the lower lands.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De la Mere raised her veil, and forgot that there was powder upon her
  face. There was something familiar about the swiftly rushing air, the song of
  the birds, and the sunshine. She turned a little doubtfully toward
  Mannister.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell me why," she demanded, "you have asked me to come with you
  today?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," he answered. "Call it a whim if you like."</p>

  <p>"You are not a person of whims," she said thoughtfully. "You do not do
  things without an object. Why did you ask me to come with you?"</p>

  <p>"If I had any reason at all," Mannister said, "beyond the obvious one of
  securing for myself a delightful companion, you will know very soon. In the
  meantime, be patient. Surely there are worse ways of spending a spring day
  than this!"</p>

  <p>"I am content," she murmured. "Even though you are my enemy, I am at least
  going to meet my fate pleasantly. How far are we going, my host? What shall
  we find at the end of the journey?"</p>

  <p>"We are going a long way," he answered, "and what we find at the end of
  the journey depends a little upon ourselves."</p>

  <p>The villages grew fewer and the road more deserted. Mannister increased
  the pace of the car, and with the gathering speed, the possibility for
  conversation, so far as he was concerned, seemed to pass away. He sat a
  little forward in his seat, his eyes fixed upon the road ahead, his whole
  attention rivetted upon his task. The woman at his side, who had all the
  courage of the fatalist, sat there calm and without misgivings. If the time
  had come for the payment of her debt to this man, she knew him well enough to
  be sure that no protests of hers would be of any avail. Her chief sensation
  was curiosity. Of late she had had some curious thoughts concerning
  Mannister. She had begun to wonder whether he were indeed the man of steel he
  seemed.</p>

  <p>They stayed for lunch at a wayside inn. Mannister ate little, and seemed
  restlessly anxious to depart. She had taken it for granted when they started
  off again that he would turn back toward London. Instead he kept the car
  going steadily westwards.</p>

  <p>"I am not unduly curious," she remarked, settling down once more by his
  side, "but we seem to have come about a hundred miles, and you are still
  rushing away from London. Is this a day excursion? Do you intend to be back
  in London in time for dinner? I did not prepare for a tour."</p>

  <p>"When we return," Mannister said, "depends on many things. At present we
  are going straight ahead. If it becomes necessary there is always the
  railway."</p>

  <p>"For me," she murmured, "no railway. I am content. Drive like this through
  such a country, and I do not care whether it be night or day. In an hour or
  two I shall forget that I am an old woman, and that my home is under the
  limelight."</p>

  <p>"No one's home is there," Mannister answered. "We flutter around those
  lights like moths around a candle. We imagine ourselves prisoners, but in our
  hearts we know that we lack only the will to be free. Once we have made up
  our minds to break away, then the rest is not so difficult."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De la Mere smiled bitterly.</p>

  <p>"My friend," she said; "I beg your pardon, my enemy&mdash;you speak now of
  things you know little about. The chains that bind us to our every-day life,
  the chains of custom and habit, are not easily broken. Sometimes they are
  lengthened, and we stray a little further away, but one always goes back,
  that is to say we ordinary people do. There may be men who are strong enough
  to file away the rivets&mdash;men, not often women!"</p>

  <p>Mannister bent over the handles and the car slackened speed. He brought it
  to a standstill close to the left-hand side of the road, beneath a grove of
  chestnut trees. Across the low hedge they could see an old-fashioned
  ivy-covered house, with lawns coming down almost to the road. A little
  pathway from the house, bordered by a ring fence, passed close to the side of
  the hedge and ended at the drive a few yards further on. Beyond was a small
  paddock, and several rhododendron beds in the zenith of their splendour.
  Mannister took out his case and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"A peaceful little place that," he remarked.</p>

  <p>She withdrew her eyes from the pink-budded chestnut blossom overhead, and
  looked across the lawns towards the house.</p>

  <p>"It is charming," she said.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he continued, "what sort of people are content to live there.
  Are they young or are they old? Do they live here for rest, or because they
  have not yet felt the call of the lights?"</p>

  <p>"Who can tell?" she answered, idly. "Why do you stay here so near to the
  gates? They could see you from the windows of the house."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he answered. "At least one is free to admire their chestnut
  blossoms. They do not know that we have presumed to wonder as to what sort of
  people they may be. Besides, I am not at all sure that they can see us from
  here."</p>

  <p>A girl came suddenly through the open door of the house, and stood upon
  the further lawn. Her hands were behind her, and she was looking steadily
  back in the direction whence they had come. She was tall and graceful, her
  fair hair was brushed simply back from her forehead, her gown was white,
  simply made, and a little short. Whilst they watched her she raised her hand
  and shaded her eyes. Mannister looked from the girl to his companion.</p>

  <p>"You see," he murmured, "she is typical of all the world. She is looking
  to where, beyond the horizon, those lights are calling. She has probably just
  left school, a convent in Belgium or Paris perhaps, and she is longing for
  the things which come with freedom."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De la Mere had watched the girl with fascinated eyes. Suddenly she
  looked away.</p>

  <p>"Do drive on!" she said, in a low tone. "I dislike looking at children of
  that age."</p>

  <p>"We cannot go for a moment," Mannister answered. "The engine needs
  cooling. This rest is doing it good. Tell me what you think she is looking
  for, that child."</p>

  <p>Once more Sophy de la Mere's eyes were fixed upon the slim girlish figure.
  She stared as one who is fascinated against her will. At that moment the door
  of the house opened, and an elderly man, leaning a little upon his stick,
  came out. He passed his arm through the girl's and they began to walk slowly
  towards the little path. Mrs. De la Mere stirred in her place uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Can't you start the car Mr. Mannister?" she asked. "If they come all the
  way round the path they will pass along by the side of the hedge, and they
  will think that we stopped here to watch them."</p>

  <p>Mannister shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Five minutes or so we must have," he said. "This is a new car, and I dare
  not risk having her over-heated. Open the bonnet, George," he added, turning
  round to the chaffeur. "She is hot, isn't she?"</p>

  <p>"A little, sir," the man admitted.</p>

  <p>"Change the sparking plug in No. 2 cylinder," Mannister ordered. "I like
  this place and I do not want to hurry," he added, turning to his companion.
  "If they walk round here now they will think we are merely doing a little
  repairing."</p>

  <p>Mrs. De la Mere was leaning a trifle forward in her seat. Her eyes never
  left the two approaching figures. Mannister heard her breathing softly.
  Suddenly she drew down her veil and leaned back in the seat. He caught a
  glimpse of her face, and he was a little alarmed.</p>

  <p>"Are you faint?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No!" she answered. "Let me alone!"</p>

  <p>He felt her hands clutch at the cushions. The man and the girl came along
  the path close to where their car was standing. As they passed the man raised
  his hat and turned to Mannister.</p>

  <p>"I hope you are not in any trouble, sir?" he asked civilly. "Can we be of
  any assistance?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much," Mannister answered. "We are only doing a very
  slight repair. It will barely take five minutes, but we could not resist
  choosing such a delightful spot for our brief rest."</p>

  <p>The two passed on. Mrs. De la Mere turned slowly round in her seat and her
  eyes followed them. Her breath was coming fast. She made no apologies to
  Mannister, for she knew very well that he understood. When at last she spoke
  to him her tone was almost hysterical.</p>

  <p>"You are getting more subtle in your tortures," she said. "Is it over now?
  May we go on?"</p>

  <p>"No!" he answered. "It is not over!"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she asked hoarsely.</p>

  <p>Mannister called to the chauffeur, who was on the point of completing his
  task.</p>

  <p>"Take my flask to the lodge gates there," he directed, "and have it half
  filled with water. You need not hurry. We shall be here for another quarter
  of an hour."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir," the man answered, and a few seconds later disappeared.
  Mannister turned once more to the woman by his side.</p>

  <p>"Sophy de la Mere," he said, "you are the last upon that list which I have
  carried in my pocket since my return to England. One by one those names have
  been crossed off. Yours alone is left there. This morning I am going to draw
  a line through your name too, and scatter the fragments of that little
  document for the west wind to play with. But before I draw that line you must
  pay."</p>

  <p>"Haven't I paid?" she moaned. "Do you think that I am so callous? Do you
  think that the passing of those two was not agony as great to me as anything
  those others may have suffered?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he answered, "and yet you have not paid!"</p>

  <p>"Then for Heaven's sake tell me quickly what it is that I must do," she
  demanded. "Shall I tear off my veil and go and confront them? Shall I throw
  my arms around the man who was my husband, and embrace the child who was my
  daughter? I am not asking for your mercy. I only beg you to tell me quickly
  and let me get it over."</p>

  <p>"You have," he said quietly, "divined your task. You are going into the
  garden, and you are going to speak to those two."</p>

  <p>She looked at him in something like horror.</p>

  <p>"You are brute enough for that?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Remember," he answered, "that your suffering, if suffering it be, is a
  matter of a quarter of an hour. There are others on my list who will not
  forget so long as they live that I have been their enemy."</p>

  <p>She laughed fiercely.</p>

  <p>"One can suffer enough in five minutes," she answered, "to carry the brand
  of one's suffering to the doors of death."</p>

  <p>"It will be your hard fortune if you find it so," he answered. "Allow
  me!"</p>

  <p>He had descended from the car and stood with outstretched hands. She
  shrank away from him.</p>

  <p>"I will not come," she said.</p>

  <p>Mannister remained unmoved His hand was still extended. He said nothing.
  He simply waited.</p>

  <p>"You cannot ask this thing of me," she moaned. "It is impossible. There is
  nothing for me to say. I could not bear to look her in the face."</p>

  <p>Still Mannister did not move. Still his hands were stretched out and his
  eyes fixed upon hers. With a little sob she descended and stood by his side.
  Without a word he led her through the gate. The girl had gone into the house.
  The man, who was on the upper lawn, saw them coming and advanced courteously
  to meet them. When he was still a few yards off, something perhaps in the
  woman's figure or her walk impressed him. He stopped short. The woman swayed,
  but Mannister held her arm firmly.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Heronswell," Mannister said quietly, "I should be glad if you could
  spare me five minutes. I have something to say to you."</p>

  <p>The man stood motionless, but he was looking at the woman by Mannister's
  side. Mannister took his acquiescence for granted.</p>

  <p>"It would be better," he said, "if you would come a little further from
  the house, say to that seat under the cedar tree."</p>

  <p>The man had not the will to go. Mrs. De la Mere was trembling so that
  movement seemed impossible. Yet they went where they were bidden, and the
  woman sank upon the seat.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Heronswell," Mannister said, "I am neither philanthropist nor
  meddler. I am one of those who by force of circumstances live outside the
  world, and realize the truth of the most trite of all sayings, that
  'Outsiders see most of the game.' You knew me years ago. My name is
  Mannister. I knew this lady when she was your wife. You disagreed, she
  treated you badly, and there was a scandal. She left you, and through some
  quixotism you declined to divorce her. That is to say you left her upon the
  world a woman with no clearly defined position. You never gave her the chance
  to marry again or to start a new life. In other words, your whim, for it was
  nothing more, is responsible for anything that may have happened to her
  since."</p>

  <p>"I am a Catholic," the man said slowly, "and I do not recognize
  divorce."</p>

  <p>"And I," Mannister answered quickly, "recognize no creed whatever save
  that one which teaches men and women to be the keepers of their own
  conscience. I should like you to understand that Mrs. De la Mere had no
  notion this morning of where she was coming, or of whom she was going to see.
  She had no notion of making any sort of appeal to you, she did not even know
  where you lived. It is I who planned this visit, and the first part of it has
  been a penance to her sufficient to cover many sins. For the rest, I want you
  at least to hear from an outsider a little summary of the present situation
  so far as it concerns you, your conscience, and the woman who was your
  wife."</p>

  <p>"Who was my wife!" the man repeated, looking fixedly at the figure upon
  the seat. Mrs. De la Mere's head had dropped between her hands. Mannister was
  executioner indeed.</p>

  <p>"Briefly," Mannister said, "the outsider's view is this. You declined to
  give your wife her freedom, therefore I say that her subsequent life,
  whatever it may have been, is of your making. Her sins and her weaknesses can
  be written down to your account, and I think that the account is nearly full.
  It is time for you to intervene, for your own sake, for hers, and for your
  daughter's."</p>

  <p>"You mean," Heronswell said, and his voice seemed to them all to come from
  a long way off, "you mean that I should apply now, after all these years, for
  a divorce?"</p>

  <p>Mannister did not answer for a moment. A breath of wind brought them a
  waft of faint sweet perfume from the rose bushes. The momentary silence was
  broken only by the humming of bees and the soft sighing of the wind in the
  little grove. All the time Heronswell's eyes were fixed upon Mannister.</p>

  <p>"You mean that," he repeated, "after all these years?"</p>

  <p>"No," Mannister answered, "I do not mean that. I mean that her place is
  here with you."</p>

  <p>The woman rose suddenly up. For the first time she spoke.</p>

  <p>"Bernard," she said, "don't listen to him I did not know. I would not have
  come if I had known what he was going to say to you. Shake hands with me once
  if you will, and let me go. I am afraid to stay here. I am afraid that she
  will come back."</p>

  <p>The woman looked anxiously up toward the house. Heronswell turned his head
  and followed the direction of her gaze.</p>

  <p>"She is very like you were, Sophy," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Take care of her," the woman sobbed, "and don't be too stern."</p>

  <p>"No!" the man answered, thoughtfully. "I have learnt my lesson."</p>

  <p>The woman stepped back with a little gasp. She would have hastened away
  toward the lodge gates, but Mannister caught her by the wrist. The girl, with
  a rose basket upon her arm, was coming round the side of the house, and
  seeing them had hesitated for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Heronswell," Mannister said, "in the old days you were a little to blame.
  You have a chance now to prove yourself a man. Take her back. Give the girl
  her mother. You will never repent it."</p>

  <p>The woman struggled to get away, and Mannister pointed towards the house.
  The girl was coming slowly towards them.</p>

  <p>"Look," he said, "there is something there which should call to you loudly
  and sweetly enough to break your heart in the days to come if you should
  close your ears. Heronswell!"</p>

  <p>He passed her hand on to Heronswell, who grasped it in his own and drew it
  towards him. Mannister, with a faint smile, raised his hat and swung round.
  The chauffeur was in his place, and with a touch of the handle the engine was
  started.</p>

  <p>"We are not waiting for the lady, sir?"</p>

  <p>Mannister shook his head, and the car swept on...</p>

  <p>Mannister dined alone in his rooms that night, for though he drove with a
  recklessness somewhat unusual to him, it was eight o'clock before he reached
  London. Behind him lay the fragments of an eventful day; the fragments, too,
  of that torn paper, which seemed to him somehow to have become associated
  with all the changing passions of his later life. It was not until past ten
  o'clock that he noticed the little pile of letters by his side. One by one he
  glanced them through carelessly enough. He came at last to a black-bordered
  envelope, which he tore open. The announcement it contained was brief enough.
  Sir George Mannister, of Sherwell Court, was dead, and his lawyers would be
  glad to receive instructions from the new baronet. Mannister threw it aside,
  and leaning back in his chair laughed long and loudly.</p>

  <p>"So the game goes on," he muttered to himself. "It is only necessary to
  hate the days that come and the things they bring, to achieve complete
  success in life. I was robbed of a fortune and I made a larger one. One by
  one the people who robbed me have paid the price. Premier baronet! I think
  that I must end it very soon, or I shall begin to think that I am a
  descendant of Monte Cristo."</p>

  <p>He tore open the other letters recklessly. Almost the last one was from
  Dunster, with whom he had exchanged now and then small civilities. He was
  staying at Nice with his daughter, and begged Mannister to come out.</p>

  <p>"By-the-bye," the letter wound up, "there is a man here who mentioned your
  name once. Perhaps you used to know him. He calls himself Gaston Sinclair. I
  hope you will decide to run out, if it is only for a few days. The journey is
  easy, and the weather out here is delightful. I know that England doesn't
  mean much for you in the spring. Do make up your mind, and send me a telegram
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Mannister did not wait until the morrow. He kept his finger pressed to the
  bell button until his servant hastily appeared.</p>

  <p>"A Continental ABC at once, Morton," his master ordered.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-10"
     id="ch-10"></a>X. HIS LAST QUEST</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Cosmopolitan</i>, Aug 1908</h3>

  <p class="first">WITHIN twenty-four hours of his arrival in Nice, Mannister
  came face to face upon the Promenade with the man he sought. Yet it is
  certain that if Dunster, with whom he was walking, had not called attention
  to him, Mannister would have passed him by without recognition. Sinclair was
  old and bent. His face was haggard, and he walked with tottering footsteps,
  leaning upon the arm of a servant. He recognized Mannister quickly enough,
  and there was a flash in his eyes which bespoke other things than the mere
  meeting again of two men who had once been friends. Dunster, who saw that the
  meeting of these two was no ordinary encounter, passed on.</p>

  <p>Mannister and Sinclair stood face to face. The latter turned to his
  servant.</p>

  <p>"I will go to that seat," he said, pointing. "I want to talk for a few
  minutes with this gentleman."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," Mannister said politely, as they walked thither, "to see you
  in such indifferent health."</p>

  <p>Sinclair answered him with a look of hatred, but he did not speak a word
  until the servant had gone.</p>

  <p>"Don't tell lies, Mannister," he said then. "I am what you made me. I have
  never been myself for a single day since you chased me half over the world.
  Don't tell lies about being sorry for me. You are sorry for no one who stands
  in your way, or who does you ill. Oh, I've heard things!" he went on. "I've
  heard&mdash;never mind! There is nothing you could do to me. I'm past it. You
  couldn't even strike a helpless brute like I am. I at least can defy
  you."</p>

  <p>"Where is your wife?" Mannister asked.</p>

  <p>"I have no wife," the other answered. "I have never been married."</p>

  <p>Mannister was very quiet, but there was something in his still voice which
  made the other, notwithstanding his assurance, crouch back in his seat.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember, Gaston Sinclair, what I told you would happen if you
  failed to take up the charge I laid upon you?"</p>

  <p>"I was willing to do it," Sinclair answered. "Upon my soul I was willing
  to do it. Look here, I knew I should meet you some day, and I made her write
  this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>With trembling fingers he drew from his breast pocket a sheet of paper and
  handed it to Mannister. Upon it was written a few sentences in delicate
  feminine handwriting.</p>

  <p>"Gaston Sinclair has offered to marry me and I have refused. Nothing would
  induce me to become his wife. I write this at his request. Christine."</p>

  <p>Mannister held the paper in his hand much longer than was necessary to
  decipher those few sentences. He read it over and over again. He fancied even
  that there came from its folds a faint suggestion of the perfume which always
  hung about her clothes and her belongings. Then he folded it up, but he did
  not pass it back to the other man.</p>

  <p>"Why did she refuse to marry you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Sinclair laughed, a hard unpleasant sound it was.</p>

  <p>"Because from the day you left us on the Oomanda Plain, she hated me.
  Because from that day to this she never even suffered her fingers to rest in
  my hand."</p>

  <p>"Where is she?" Mannister asked coldly.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," Sinclair answered. "I have neither seen nor heard from
  her since the day she left the hospital at Buenos Ayres."</p>

  <p>"She was ill, then?" Mannister asked.</p>

  <p>"She was taken ill with a fever the day you left," Sinclair answered.
  "They got her back to the city and into the hospital. I stayed there,
  although she refused always to see me. When she was well enough to leave I
  saw her for five minutes only. I made her write down her refusal of what I
  offered. Apart from that she declined to have anything to say to me. She
  would not tell me her plans, where she was going or what she meant to do. She
  had finished with me, and she told me so as plainly as a woman could speak. I
  came back to England, and I have been as you see me ever since."</p>

  <p>"You left her in Buenos Ayres?" Mannister said.</p>

  <p>"I know only that she came to London," Sinclair answered.</p>

  <p>Mannister's teeth were hard set. He was looking out through the network of
  luxurious shrubs to where the blue sea was dotted everywhere with white
  sails. Sinclair leaned a little forward in his seat watching him. His long
  lean fingers were shaking, his eyes were bright with malicious
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Mannister," he said, "if one comes near to death one sees things clearly.
  It was a hellish trick those men sought to play upon you. They made only one
  mistake. They did not think that you would leave me alive. I had some of the
  money they robbed you of. Do you want it back?"</p>

  <p>"No!" Mannister answered. "I am a rich man. It was never the money,
  Sinclair."</p>

  <p>"I came back to England," Sinclair continued, "and I watched them go,
  broken men, one by one. I am the last of them, Mannister. Are you sure that
  there is nothing you would like to do to me? Can't you think of something in
  the shape of suffering you could bring down upon my shoulders?"</p>

  <p>Mannister rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"No!" he said. "As you are I am content to leave you."</p>

  <p>The other plucked at his sleeve.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Mannister," he said. "Listen calmly if you can. Do not strike
  me. Look at what I am, and restrain yourself. I did not win your wife away
  from you fairly. She did not go because she loved me and hated you. I forged
  letters and showed them to her. I invented lies and filled her ears with
  them. She charged me with it that day after you had caught us, and I told her
  the truth."</p>

  <p>Mannister looked at him as one might regard some noxious insect.</p>

  <p>"I shall not strike you, Gaston Sinclair," he said. "To be what you are,
  and to know yourself for what you are, is punishment enough for any one on
  earth."</p>

  <p>Mannister turned on his heel and walked back to the villa where he was
  staying. A travelling carriage, piled with luggage, was standing there at the
  door. May Dunster, who had just arrived from Rome, came out to meet him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Mannister," she said, a little shyly, "this is delightful. I had no
  idea that I should find you here."</p>

  <p>"I had no idea of coming," he answered, "but your father in his invitation
  happened to mention the name of a man whom I was very anxious to see. I came
  and I have seen him, and now I am afraid that I must go away."</p>

  <p>"Not just yet," she pleaded. "You must stay for a few days. And I forgot,
  I must call you Sir George, mustn't I?"</p>

  <p>"You can call me anything you like," he answered. "Have you seen your
  father? I left him upon the promenade."</p>

  <p>"Never mind about my father yet," she answered. "I want to talk to you for
  a few minutes. There was no one else in the world whom I wanted so much to
  see. Come down into the garden."</p>

  <p>He followed her a little unwillingly to a spot where the shrubs had been
  cleared away, and where one looked down upon the whitewashed villas and
  gardens of Nice, and beyond the sea. She turned and motioned him to lean by
  her side against the railing.</p>

  <p>"I wanted," she said, "so much to see you. I wanted to ask your
  advice."</p>

  <p>He smiled a little bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, "that one who has done so ill with his own life,
  is a poor person to show others the way to happiness. However, tell me what
  it is that troubles you, and I will do my best."</p>

  <p>"I have been in Rome," she said, "for two months with my aunt, and on the
  whole&mdash;yes, I am sure that I have enjoyed it very much indeed. From the
  first there was some one there who was very nice and kind to me. He took us,
  my aunt and myself, to all the places I wanted to see. He always danced with
  me and rode. No one could have been so kind or so delightful as he was. And
  then, a few days before I came away, he asked me to marry him."</p>

  <p>Mannister nodded.</p>

  <p>"What was his name?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Phillimore," she answered. "He is a son of Lord Ernest Phillimore, the
  ambassador at Rome."</p>

  <p>"I know him," Mannister remarked. "At least, that is I have met him once
  or twice. If he is only half such a decent fellow as I thought he was, and as
  I know his father is, you ought to be very happy."</p>

  <p>She turned and looked into his face, looked with such earnestness that he
  felt obliged to turn toward her. There was nothing in his eyes which answered
  in the least the somewhat wistful gleam which shone in hers. She looked at
  him steadily, and when she turned away she sighed a little.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, "when he asked me I could not answer him. It seemed to
  me that I liked him very much, but there was something away back in my
  thoughts which kept me from saying yes to him, as it would have kept me from
  saying yes to any one. Perhaps it was a little girlish sentiment, perhaps it
  was something more. But I do not know, I could not feel sure of myself,
  because, you see, it was something which, however foolish it may seem, has
  somehow grown almost dear to me. I did not feel that I could part with it
  very easily. I did not feel that I could marry any one unless I found out
  really whether it was just a fancy founded upon a dream, or whether there was
  anything real beneath it all. I thought," she added wistfully, "that I should
  know the truth when I met you again. I told him that I could not answer him
  for a little time. When I said a little time, what I really meant was that I
  could not answer him until I had seen you."</p>

  <p>Mannister smiled down upon her with the grave seriousness of a person
  belonging to some elder generation.</p>

  <p>"My dear child," he said, "I do not quite understand. If it is my advice
  you are asking, I give it to you frankly and honestly. I should like to hear
  that you were engaged to marry Arthur Phillimore."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that?" she asked, and he fancied that there was a shade of
  disappointment in her tone.</p>

  <p>"I mean it," he answered.</p>

  <p>And then for a moment he let his hand rest upon hers.</p>

  <p>"Little girl," he said, "I think I know what it is that you have had in
  your mind. You have been a little sorry for me because you have known that I
  have not been altogether happy, and your kind little heart was touched. It
  was very sweet of you, and I shall never forget it, but that sort of thing
  has nothing to do with the love which you must have for your husband. I am
  old enough to be your father, and although I do not speak of these things
  because there is trouble connected with them, I have a wife who lives still
  somewhere. Write and tell him your answer. I should like so much to see him
  before I leave Nice."</p>

  <p>He raised the hand upon which his fingers were resting to his lips, and
  turned away toward the house. Those few tears he knew very well would soon
  have passed. Already he was only anxious to leave the place.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Then Mannister became a wanderer upon the face of the earth. He sought no
  new lands, nor did he betray the traveller's interest in unexplored places.
  He passed from country to country of Europe, he was heard of even in the
  great cities of America. To all appearance his journeying was the journeying
  of a restless man. For two years he neither shot nor hunted, sport of no kind
  seemed able to attract him The few people who met him spoke of him as aged.
  With the scattering to the winds of those fragments of paper, it seemed as
  though the purpose had gone out of his life. There was no one who suspected
  that his restless travelling hither and thither was in reality nothing more
  nor less than a search. It was in Paris that he received the first gleam of
  encouragement in all those weary two years. He was driving down from the Bois
  one afternoon, and when in the Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es he passed a carriage in which
  were seated two ladies, one old and one young. He himself was in a hired
  voiture, looking down with only faintly simulated interest upon the constant
  stream of automobiles and carriages. Nevertheless their eyes met, although it
  was only for a second, and Mannister, galvanized into sudden and complete
  life, springing to his feet, stopped the <i>cocher</i> and upset the whole
  traffic for several moments, as in obedience to his peremptory orders they
  turned round and endeavoured to overtake the retreating carriage. Their
  effort was in vain. The tired hack had no chance against the pair of
  thoroughbreds, who were already almost out of sight. But Mannister was too
  much in earnest to be easily turned aside from his purpose. The liveries of
  the carriage, dark green, and the small coronet upon the panels, served him
  as a basis for a restless fire of inquiries directed to the gendarmes, the
  commissionaire at the famous restaurant in the Bois, wherever there seemed a
  chance of obtaining information. Late that night Mannister obtained the
  information he sought, and at mid-day the next morning he was ushered into
  the presence of Madame la Comtesse de Lanier, in whom he recognized at once
  the elder of those two women. Mannister's apologies were brief.</p>

  <p>"I trust, Madame," he said, "that you will pardon my intrusion, but for
  two years I have been searching for the lady whom I saw in your carriage
  yesterday afternoon. She is perhaps your guest in Paris."</p>

  <p>Madame la Comtesse touched the bell even as she answered him.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," she said, "the history of that lady is very well known to me.
  Be assured that you will never hear of her or from her under this roof. She
  was my guest. I was hoping that she would remain so for some time to come.
  But at the sight of you she packed her trunks. By this time she is far from
  Paris."</p>

  <p>"Her address?" Mannister demanded. "She does not understand. I do not wish
  her any harm."</p>

  <p>Madame la Comtesse turned to the servant who had answered her summons.</p>

  <p>"The door to Monsieur," she ordered, and Mannister had no option but to
  go.</p>

  <p>He returned to London, accepted an invitation to visit some friends in
  Scotland, and left again at the end of two days absolutely incapable of
  devoting himself to the purpose of his visit, the shooting of his host's
  grouse. He spent a few days in London, and was on the point of leaving it
  when he received a letter from May Dunster, written from a small town in the
  north of Italy.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <blockquote>
    "I am writing," she said, "not only to remind you of your promise to come
    to my wedding in Rome next month, but to ask you to do something which you
    will probably think strange, but which I will explain when I see you. I
    want you to take the first train you can catch and come here. You must come
    direct to Florence, and at the <i>Hotel Splendide</i> you will find a
    letter from me telling you how to reach this place. My father is with me,
    and also Mr. Phillimore. When you come I will explain."
  </blockquote>

  <p>Two nights afterwards he dined on the balcony of a long, low white villa
  overlooking the Adriatic, with the perfume of the orange groves floating from
  the land, and the soft sea-breeze, travelling across a sea almost as still as
  glass, rustling gently amongst the shrubs and lemon trees which encircled the
  house. After dinner she drew him on one side and pointed across the water,
  faintly agleam now with the light of the rising moon, to a tiny island barely
  a mile away.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," she said, "whether you can see amongst the trees there a
  little villa, the villa D'Ajuta they call it. It has been empty for three
  years. A fortnight ago it was taken by a countrywoman of ours."</p>

  <p>He looked at it without interest.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Do you know," she said, hesitatingly, "I am not sure even now whether I
  have, been justified in sending you that letter. You see in Rome every one
  knows every one else's business. I have heard new things of my oldest
  friends, and amongst others I have heard things about Sir George
  Mannister."</p>

  <p>He smiled a little wearily.</p>

  <p>"People have had many things to say about me," he answered, "and I fear
  that it could have been nothing good that you heard from the tongues of
  gossips."</p>

  <p>"I heard this, at any rate," she answered, "that for two years you had
  travelled about in the fashion of a man who seeks something which he can
  never find. I heard other things, and I heard other people's construction of
  these things and of your journeyings, and then I put them together and I came
  to a different conclusion from any of them, and I may have been right, and I
  may have been wrong, but I sent for you to tell you that I believe that the
  woman who has taken the villa that you can see amongst the trees there, is
  the woman for whom you have been searching these last two years."</p>

  <p>Mannister would take no boatman, or heed the warnings of those who spoke
  to him of the sudden squalls. It seemed to him that the suppressed energy of
  years throbbed in his muscles as he drove the long sharp-prowed boat through
  the still waters. He felt no fatigue. He looked neither to the right nor to
  the left, but only to that faintly burning light towards which he held his
  way. The phosphorus which gleamed in the water, which dropped even amongst
  the spray which fell from his oars, he took no heed of. The brown-sailed
  fishing smack which crossed his bows, with a quaint horn lantern hanging from
  the mast, passed him unnoticed. He returned no answer to the musical
  greetings of the men who lounged there smoking their long cigarettes. To him
  there was but one object in life, and he attained it when he drove with one
  last powerful stroke his little boat on to the sandy beach of the island
  toward which May Dunster had pointed. He scarcely waited to ship his oars and
  make the boat secure. Up through a little avenue of trees, whose perfume
  seemed to make fragrant the cool night, he hastened toward the villa. One by
  one the lights had been extinguished, until at last when he reached the front
  he found the place in utter darkness. He stumbled round until he found a
  door, and hammered at it until an elderly man-servant drew back the chains
  and showed himself. It struck Mannister from the first that he was not so
  much surprised as one living on an island might be at a midnight visitor.
  Mannister inquired impatiently for his mistress. The man stretched out his
  hands. Only this afternoon, he explained, the Signora had departed. She had
  had news. It might have been bad, it might have been good. He could not say.
  But he only knew that she had gone. For a month, perhaps, or two&mdash;who
  could tell? She had promised to write, but certain it was that she had gone,
  and gone for some time.</p>

  <p>Mannister was at first incredulous. He produced gold, but the old man,
  though his eyes were lit with desire, kept to his story.</p>

  <p>"I will show the Signor," he declared, "every room in the villa, and he
  will see that the Signora has indeed gone."</p>

  <p>Mannister accepted his challenge. The villa was a small one, the
  apartments in the front of the house were certainly all empty, and showed
  signs of a hasty departure. There were traces of packing, several trunks were
  already there ready for forwarding, and the rooms themselves were devoid of
  any signs of present occupation. Mannister asked for pen and ink, and wrote a
  letter.</p>

  <p>"You have trunks there," he said, "to forward to the Signora. You will
  forward with them this letter."</p>

  <p>He placed gold upon the table, and the old man promised. Then Mannister
  rowed back to the mainland, but he rowed as a man weary and tired, and
  daylight was breaking eastward before his journey was over. Then he went
  wearily up to his room and slept.</p>

  <p>On the morrow he turned homeward again. For three weeks he stayed in his
  rooms. Then one night he received a telegram from Rome.</p>

  <p>"I am breaking a promise," it said, "but I do it for your sake. Meet the
  Continental train at Victoria, due 6.45."</p>

  <p>Mannister was there half an hour before the train was due, only to find
  that it was an hour late. Restlessly he walked up and down the platform. Was
  this, then, to be the end of his search, a meeting in a railway station? What
  could he say to her there, or she to him? What was there to be said? What
  could be the possible outcome? His heart sank, and rose again as he thought
  over the possibilities of the next few minutes. At one time it seemed to him
  that he was following a will-o'-the-wisp. At another he felt that the new
  life which he knew so well was possible to him, might start within the next
  few hours. The train came, and with a fever of impatience he peered into the
  carriages as they glided by. And then, exactly opposite to him as the train
  stopped, a tall, heavily veiled woman stepped out on to the platform almost
  into his arms.</p>

  <p>"Christine!" he said, and held out his hands.</p>

  <p>The woman clutched at the shoulder of her maid, who was close behind. She
  looked at Mannister as one might look at a ghost. Mannister calmly took the
  cloak from her arm and held her hand in his.</p>

  <p>"Christine," he said, "I have been looking for you for more than two
  years. It has seemed a very long time that you have been coming. Won't you
  give your maid that luggage ticket? She can take your things wherever you
  will. The carriage is waiting for you and for me at the entrance here."</p>

  <p>She looked long and steadily into his face, and the longer she looked the
  more the terror which at first had seized her seemed to pass away.</p>

  <p>"George," she whispered, "is it possible that you have forgiven?"</p>

  <p>"It is possible," he answered, "it is true. I am here to welcome you
  home."</p>

  <p>She passed her arm through his, and a little sob broke from her
  throat.</p>

  <p>"And you have been looking for me," she murmured, "for two years, and all
  the time I have been flying from you, terrified. And I have been lonely all
  the time."</p>

  <p>Mannister laughed softly as he handed her into his brougham.</p>

  <p>"I, too," he answered, "but that is over."</p>
