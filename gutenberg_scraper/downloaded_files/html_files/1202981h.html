<h2>THE COURIER-MAIL'S NEW SERIAL</h2>

<h3>ANOTHER LAROSE ROMANCE</h3>

<p class="first">Gilbert Larose, the Australian-born detective
who is known as "The Man who Never Fails," is now listed among
the great detectives of fiction. His creator, Mr. Arthur Cecil
Gask, is a Londoner by birth, and education,  lives in Adelaide.
He is a dental surgeon who writes detective fiction as a hobby.
Nine of his books (including "The Shadow of Larose," "The
Judgment of Larose," and "The Poisoned Goblet" all of which have
appeared as serials in <i>The Courier-Mail</i>) have been
published in England, and three have been published separately in
the United States. His latest novel is entitled "The Hangman's
Knot," but the subtle meaning of the title actually does not
present itself until the last paragraph of the story.</p>

<p>A terror was stalking through London, Six murders were recorded in seven weeks. There were no clues to pick up; no trails to follow; just the whine of a bullet, the stab of a knife, and the murderer was lost in the blackness of night. That was the position when Gilbert Larose, now happily married to a wealthy titled woman, was induced to return to Scotland Yard. He came; and in the end he triumphed, but it was a miracle that he lived.</p>

<p>The story represents Larose's greatest triumph, and it is Mr. Gask's most finished novel.</p>

Somewhere, night after night, in some foul den, inhuman
monsters gather, and murder is done." That remark by a Cabinet Minister is what brought Gilbert Larose back to Scotland Yard to face a ruthless gang of murderers. Mr. Gask has written a thrilling story about it. The first instalment will appear in to-morrow's issue of "The Courier-Mail."</i></p>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I.<br>

SOWING THE WIND.</h2>

<p class="first">MAN is always an animal, and civilisation,
culture, and the conventions of society are but the mask that
covers over the face of the beast. Sometimes the mask is lifted
and then we gaze upon expressions more terrible than those of any
creature of the wild, because of the resentment of the beast at
the restraints that have been imposed upon him.</p>

<p><br>
AH CHUNG was a marine store dealer on Limehouse
Causeway, and from the outward appearance of his shop it was no
different from any others of its kind by the river side. In the
big shed, however, at the far end of the backyard, happenings
occurred that were unknown except to a very few, and which would
have been of great interest to the police, if by any chance they
had come to their knowledge.</p>

<p>The shed was roomy and most substantially built. It had double
doors, double windows, and was completely sound-proof.</p>

<p>The marine store, notwithstanding its rather small size, did a
good trade, and there were always customers passing in and out.
Ah Chung had, however, several other sources of income, and
indeed was quite well-to-do. Although people were not aware of
the fact, he owned the houses on either side of the one he lived
in, and also the barber's shop that abutted on to his yard at the
back, and opened into Rent Street. There were hidden means of
communication between all the four houses.</p>

<p>The houses adjoining Ah Chung's shop were managed by relations
of Ah Chung. One was a lodging-house, and the other a bird and
live-stock shop. In this latter, in addition to parrots,
canaries, ducks, and even the humble fowl, you could purchase
animals drawn from all parts of the world. Monkeys were always
obtainable and sometimes wallabies, and occasionally, even a
mongoose. There were cats of all varieties in cages, and a number
of dogs, the latter, however, were usually of large size, and
evidently intended for watch-dogs, rather than for pets.</p>

<p>The tenant of the barber's shop was a Swiss, named Voisin, and
like the majority of his country-men he was taciturn and short of
speech. He said little as he cut hair and shaved, but
nevertheless took good stock of all his customers as they came
in, as if instead of being a barber, he were a medical man and
studying all their cases. He had served a term of imprisonment in
his own country and in this, the country of his adoption, he had
also reason for fearing the police. Occasionally he used to visit
Ah Chung late at night, and in the intervals of discussing
business, endeavour to make himself agreeable to the latter's two
young and pretty wives. The girls, however, spoke no French or
German and little English, being both recent importations, and
they only giggled at his clumsy advances.</p>

<p>In a friendly way, Ah Chung was well-known to the police, and,
indeed, was held by them in some esteem. He was marked as
straight at headquarters, for he had many times been of service
to the authorities in putting them upon the tracks of dealers in
illicit drugs. He was never, however, seen to approach any police
station, but from time to time a neatly typed letter would arrive
at the station in Limehouse, with a dot and two dashes instead of
a signature, and it would be known from whom it came. It would
give certain information, and that information would invariably
prove to be correct. Ah Chung was paid for these services, and he
expected to be, too, for it was at all times, he averred, a risk
to be having dealings with the police. He was most businesslike
in all his transactions, and quick in his decisions always knew
his own mind.</p>

<p>One day an enterprising and energetic plain-clothes man,
McCarthy by name, came into the shop, and with the pretence of
inspecting a coil of rope, put some questions to Ah Chung about
the barber, Voisin.</p>

<p>"I'm getting suspicious," he whispered, "for I've noticed that
some nights he gets a lot of callers after his place is shut. Do
you know anything about him?"</p>

<p>Ah Chung's face was as expressionless as that of the Sphinx.
"I have never seen him," he lied softly. He spoke perfect
English. "I know nothing."</p>

<p>The plain-clothes man laughed. "Well, you be careful," he
said, "and don't start sticking a knife into me, if you catch me
one night in your back-yard. I may climb up on to his roof that
way and take a peep through the sky-light."</p>

<p>Two nights later McCarthy did not return home, and later it
was believed he had fallen into the river and got drowned,
although his body was never recovered. Ah Chung heard of his
disappearance, but made no comment. He had just been examining a
police whistle under a powerful magnifying-glass to see if there
were any distinguishing marks upon it, and finding there were
none, had polished it up and put it into stock. He never believed
in wasting anything.</p>

<p>Upon certain nights gatherings were held in the big shed and
then for an unknown person to enter, it was many times more
difficult than to obtain an invitation for the Royal Enclosure at
Ascot. The visitors arrived through any of the four houses, and
they nearly always came alone, as single units. Their hats, too,
were generally pressed low down upon their foreheads and the
collars of their coats turned up. They seldom spoke to one
another, and when they left they were escorted out, one by
one.</p>

<p>Ah Chung catered for one of the by products of civilisation
that can be found in any of the big cities of the world, the
educated and cultured depraved, who with all outward appearance
of refinement, yet so gloat upon the infliction of suffering that
no forms of cruelty fail to be appreciated, or are too strong for
their palates.</p>

<p><br>
AH CHUNG was not aware that there was a scientific name for
this cult, and that it was one, well recognised, among the
classes of degenerates. All he knew was that he supplied a want
and was well paid for doing so. It had taken him many years to
build up the connection, and he had made the circle most
exclusive, a guinea being the invariable charge for
admission.</p>

<p>The interior of the shed was arranged in the form of a
miniature theatre, the stage, however, being in the middle. Well-cushioned seats, in three tiers, surrounded a large rat pit at
the bottom. The pit was 12ft. square, and either inside, or upon
a platform that could be speedily placed in position upon it,
were staged the dramas that were so gratifying to Ah Chung's
patrons. Save for the faint and diffused rays that escaped from a
closely hooded arc-light that was swung directly over the pit,
the whole place was always in darkness.</p>

<p>The events of the evening generally commenced with a score or
so of large rats being introduced into the pit, to be followed by
one or more excited and yelping fox-terriers, but in order that
the enjoyment of the audience might be prolonged and the full
flavour of everything obtained, the dogs were always muzzled. The
muzzles, however, were provided at their ends with a short spike
of a needle-like sharpness.</p>

<p>Then would follow an interesting ten minutes or quarter of an
hour, until finally the unhappy rodents had been either bruised
or spiked to death, not however, without having inflicted visible
injuries upon the victorious terriers. Red shows up well upon a
background of white.</p>

<p>Sometimes, instead of terriers, a cat would be introduced to
deal with three or four rats, and then great enjoyment would be
experienced by the playfulness with which she would pass from one
rat to another, before giving them the final despatch.</p>

<p>Again, a muzzled cat, with her claws closely trimmed, would be
put into the pit and two or three monkeys would provide
entertainment by jumping upon her and plucking out handfuls of
her fur.</p>

<p>Later, a platform would be thrown over the pit, and a huge
cage placed in position, a fight between two large and savage
dogs would be shown, or a series of cock-fights, or upon rare
occasions an encounter between an ape and a dog.</p>

<p>Then the seats upon one side of the shed would be vacated and
with Ah Chung's cinematograph coming into play, pictures smuggled
into the country from all parts of the world would be thrown upon
the screen. It but faintly suggests their nature to state that no
censor upon earth would have passed them, either for public or
private view, for apart from those of a wholly unmentionable
kind, they always depicted incidents of horror or brutality.</p>

<p>And when everything was all over, Ah Chung, placid and
respectful as a well-trained gentleman's servant, would stand by
the door, and as he collected payment, whisper the date of the
next meeting, and often add that he was expecting then to have
something yet more interesting to show.</p>

<p><br>
ONE night after one of these gatherings, when the chimes of
midnight were just sounding, a well-dressed man alighted from a
taxi-cab in Cavendish Square, and proceeded to walk briskly along
until he came to a house at the junction of Wimpole and Queen
Anne Streets. Taking a latch-key from his pocket, he was about to
insert it in the door when he was accosted by another man, who
came gliding up like a shadow from the area railings, where he
had evidently been waiting, of set purpose.</p>

<p>"Professor Batcher, I believe," said this second man, and
receiving a cold nod in answer, he asked. "Can I speak to you for
a few minutes?"</p>

<p>"Speak," was the curt rejoinder, and the professor immediately
slipped the hand that had been holding the latch-key into one of
the side pockets of his overcoat.</p>

<p>"But I should like to have the few words with you inside your
house," said the other. He lowered his voice, and added, "I, too,
was at Ah Chung's to-night."</p>

<p>The professor gave an almost imperceptible start, but he
replied quite steadily, "I don't understand. I don't know what
you mean."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes you do," came the quick response, "and although I
always wear dark glasses at Ah Chung's, you will recognise me at
once. See," the speaker snapped a little electric torch full on
to his own face for a few seconds. "It was I," he went on, "who
asked you for a match to-night, just when that bulldog had got
the Alsatian by the throat."</p>

<p>A moment's silence followed upon the torch being extinguished,
and then the professor asked sharply, "Well, what do you
want?"</p>

<p>"I have a proposition to put before you," replied the man with
the torch. He shook his head quickly. "No, you needn't be afraid.
It's not money I'm after, for I've plenty of that, and I'm not
connected with the police. It's a comrade I am looking for, and I
should never have dared to approach you, if I had not been
certain that you were a suitable one."</p>

<p>"How did you learn my name?" asked the professor, and there
was nothing in the sternness of his tone to suggest that the
explanation had in any way tended to inspire confidence in
him.</p>

<p>"In the same way that I have learned everything else about
you," laughed the man softly, "by extended and patient
inquiries." He spoke quickly. "I have been interested in you for
many months. Your name is not Batcher. It is Libbeus, Joseph
Libbeus, and you are a doctor of medicine, a graduate of London
University. You are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," broke in the professor angrily, "you are quite
mistaken. You have been wrongly informed."</p>

<p>"You are 39 years of age," went on the stranger, as if he had
not heard the interruption, "and ten years ago came under the
notice of the police, when a woman patient of yours died. You
were sentenced to five years' penal servitude, and your name was
removed from the Medical Register. Upon your release from prison
you went to Shanghai, but three years ago you returned to this
country, and set up here as an expert upon diet and slimming.
Nearly all of your patients are women, and you are doing well,
but without being aware of your real identity, the police have
recently become suspicious that you are engaged upon the same
work that got you into trouble before. They have set two traps
for you within the past five weeks, but you escaped them both
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The professor made a gesture of impatience. "That'll do," he
exclaimed sharply. He took out his latch-key again and thrust it
in the door. "Come in and we'll have that talk you want." He
paused a moment and then added menacingly. "But you be careful to
play no tricks, for I warn you I am armed."</p>

<p>"Yes," remarked the stranger quietly, "you have a knuckle-duster in your pocket. I felt it when I was sitting next to you
at Ah Chung's."</p>

<p><br>
THE father of Miss Cynthia Cramm kept the Gibbet Inn, situated
midway between the pretty little Sussex villages of Hartfield and
Maresfield, upon the beautiful stretch of road running on the
uplands through Ashdown Forest.</p>

<p>Miss Cramm had turned sixteen years of age, but she did not
look fourteen. She was small and skinny, with an alert, quick,
little face, and eyes as bright as a bird's, and what she did not
know of life was of no interest or she would have learnt it.</p>

<p>Essentially a product of these modern times, she knew more
than her grandmother did, and could have told that old lady
things that would have caused her to uplift her hands in horror,
and dim her horn-rimmed spectacles with tears.</p>

<p>She read every line of the two daily newspapers that were
taken at the inn, including the advertisements, and was
particularly interested in the divorce news. She held strong
views upon certain burning social questions, and did not hesitate
to express her disapproval that she had been followed into the
world by five more little Cramms.</p>

<p>"We could not afford it," she snapped decisively, "and in
consequence father is not now able to give us the education that
he should."</p>

<p>She smoked when she could do so without her father seeing her,
used powder and a lip-stick when she went out with her boy
friends, and also she already boasted of preferences in the
matter of cocktails. Her great ambition was to go on the
films.</p>

<p>Romantically situated with beautiful views on all sides, the
Gibbet Inn did a good trade, and Mrs. Cramm's Sunday luncheons
were known far and wide. The house had become a favourite place
of call for the motoring world, and quite apart from the food
being always well-cooked and daintily served, the nomenclature
itself of the inn was attractive, for people liked to tell their
friends that they had 'lunched at the Gibbet.' The inn had
prospered, and a commodious dining room had been built on. This
room contained a long table running down the centre of the room
and a much smaller one, placed just under the widow at the far
end. On Sundays three smartly-attired maids attended to the wants
of the visitors.</p>

<p><br>
ONE certain Sunday morning then, in the last week of June,
towards half-past twelve, when all was bustle and preparation for
the midday meal, and Thomas Cramm was busy in the bar, Miss Cramm
was ordered by her mother to iron the aprons for two of her
little sisters, and she flatly refused to do anything of the
kind. Not that the young lady had any objection to the ironing on
Sabbatarian grounds. She had no scruples there, but she had been
up late the night before at a party, and was feeling tired, and
it happened, too, that at that moment when her services were
required by her mother, she was busy watching from an upper
window a handsome young couple who had just driven a very smart
little two-seater into the yard and were now going lovingly over
the bodywork with a duster. From the luggage strapped on the back
Miss Cramm was of opinion that they were a honeymoon couple, and
always romantically inclined, she was considering as to whether
they had been married the previous day, and did not want to be
disturbed in attempting to deduce from the glances they kept on
giving to one another, whether she were right or not, in her
conjecture.</p>

<p>So, when the order from her mother arrived by one of the maids
she sent back a curt message that she should not comply with the
request. Her mother was furious, for already twice that morning
Cynthia had been impertinent, or in the vernacular, had given her
parent 'lip,' so now the latter, very red in the face, left the
pressing duties in the kitchen and came running upstairs to
administer suitable chastisement.</p>

<p>But Cynthia heard her coming, and reluctantly tearing herself
away from the window, escaped through another door, banging it to
behind her in her mother's face.</p>

<p>"All right, you dreadful child," shouted Mrs. Cramm
stertorously. "I'll fetch your father at once."</p>

<p>Now her father was the only person whom Cynthia really feared,
for he was of quick temper and had a heavy hand. It was fresh in
her memory, too, that not a week before, when following upon a
very one-sided encounter with him, she had later sat down at the
piano to play her favourite piece, 'The Lost Chord,' she had had
to put an extra cushion upon the piano-stool to escape actual
physical discomfort.</p>

<p>So when a couple of minutes or so later, Mr. Cramm came
tearing upstairs to 'have a few words,' it is not surprising that
Miss Cramm was nowhere to be found. Not only was she not visible
in any of the upper rooms, but a hasty search of the ground floor
revealed no sign of her presence there either, and so the
landlord of the Gibbet Inn, with an ugly look upon his face, that
undoubtedly presaged more physical discomfort for his daughter
when he could lay hands upon her, returned fuming, into the
bar.</p>

<p>There were twenty-seven luncheons served that day&mdash;the
police were afterwards able to verify that. One party of six, two
of four, five of two, and three parties who came alone. At least
that was how the bills were paid, according to the very accurate
bookkeeping of Mrs. Cramm, but the head-waitress who collected
the money at the tables, later told a rather peculiar tale. She
said that where one bill was seemingly paid for a party of four
people lunching there together, it was actually discharged for
the meals of four separate individuals, who came in singly, sat
apart from one another at the long table, and had no conversation
together until all the other lunchers had left the room. Then
suddenly, in her momentary absence, they had all moved to the
small table under the window, and a call being made for liqueurs
and a bottle of the best port, they had at once started to talk
amiably together, as if they were old friends.</p>

<p>She remembered the incident distinctly, because the one who
had ordered the port asked that they should be left undisturbed
for a little while, and the time extending for longer than an
hour, it had hindered the clearing away and the setting of the
table for the expected afternoon teas. It had been most
inconvenient.</p>

<p>And the story of the waitress was quite correct, except in one
particular, for after the four lunchers had moved over to the
small table they had not started at once to talk amiably together
as old friends. On the contrary, three of them had appeared to be
very distrustful of one another, and if the waitress had been of
a more observant nature she would have noted that it was only the
fourth man who was smiling, and that the others looked very
angry.</p>

<p>What really happened was this. The four men partook of their
meal, quietly and unobtrusively and as if they had no interest
except in the fare provided. The meal consisted of boiled cod and
oyster sauce, roast chicken and roast duck, cherry tart, and a
beautiful ripe Stilton cheese.</p>

<p>They had kept pace with the other lunchers until the sweet had
been served, and then, all at once, they had begun to dawdle and
eat very slowly, at the same time assuming thoughtful and
lethargic airs. It seemed as if none of them were in any hurry
and almost, as if of set purpose, they each one wanted to outstay
everybody else.</p>

<p>But a stout couple were most unduly interested in the Stilton
cheese, and returning many times to the attack, it was nearly
half past two before these latter rose from their seats and the
four men were the only occupants of the room.</p>

<p>Then the appearance of casual indifference upon the face of
one of them passed instantly away, and his knife falling with a
sharp click on to his plate, he made a motion with his arm
embracing the other three, and remarked quietly, but very
distinctly, "Gentlemen, the password is 'the rat-pit of Ah
Chung,' and you are all three my guests." His face expanded into
a broad smile. "We are old friends."</p>

<p>But there was certainly no appearance of friendliness upon the
faces of the others, indeed annoyance almost to the point of
positive anger seemed to possess them. They looked most
suspiciously at one another, and then turned back to glare
balefully at the man who had spoken.</p>

<p>The latter raised a big fat hand in protest. "No, no, don't be
upset," he said, reassuringly, and in a pleasant, cultured voice,
"for at any rate no harm is done, and if you do not wish it, you
can continue to remain unknown to one another, and part as
perfect strangers in a few minutes." He glanced in the direction
of the door, and spoke very quickly. "I thought it best to bring
you all together in this way, for I have made exactly the same
proposition to each one of you, and if any of you so decide, you
can withdraw in perfect safety from any association with me, and
it can be then as if we had never met."</p>

<p>He rose up from his chair. "But now, let us move over to that
small table and we'll just talk things over for a little while.
You can at least hear what I have to say." He smiled. "For the
moment you can call me 'Mr. X,' and you gentlemen"&mdash;he
pointed at them, each in turn, "can be Messrs. A, B, and C."</p>

<p>After a moment's hesitation, but without speaking a single
word, the three men rose up, too, and followed him over to the
table by the window. They were just seated when one of the maids
returned into the room, and, as we have heard the order was then
given for a bottle of port and liqueurs.</p>

<p>Once more by themselves, and the door closed again, the man
who had taken charge of the proceedings leant forward over the
table and regarded his companions with an amused smile. He was
not by any means an unpleasant man to look upon, and the first
impression he would have given anyone was of amiable and carefree
good nature, of medium height and decidedly upon the stout side,
he was of a dark and well-tanned complexion. His eyebrows were
big and busy, and he sported a neatly trimmed black beard. His
eyes were large and fearless, and it was only his lips that would
have been displeasing to a reader of character, for they were
full and sensual. However, in repose, he had the habit of keeping
them pressed lightly together and in that way their defects were
not so apparent to the casual observer. He was very short-necked,
and he had fat hands, upon the finger of one of which he sported
a diamond ring, with a stone of exquisite quality.</p>

<p>He started to renew the conversation at once. "I regret,
gentlemen," he said melodiously, and with the glib tongue of the
practised speaker, "if any of you should regard it as a breach of
confidence my having thus gathered you here together, when each
one of you expected you would be the only one to be meeting me,
but when you have heard my explanation and all I have to tell
you, I am sure you will acquit me of any charge of trickery, and
will as readily admit that I am exposing none of you to any risk
by this meeting."</p>

<p>He laughed slyly. "It may surprise you to learn that I have
been occupied for the best part of two years in finding out all I
could about you three, and it is only after long and patient
inquiries, and the expenditure of considerable sums of money that
I feel at last justified in risking my safety in your hands." He
sighed. "There should, indeed, have been a fourth guest with us
to-day, but, unhappily, last week he passed away with great
suddenness, in fact, to make no mystery of it,"&mdash;&mdash;his
eyes twinkled&mdash;"he was hanged at the Old Bailey."</p>

<p>One of his audience, the one he had pointed to as Mr. B., a
square-jawed man with heavy features and small, suspicious-looking eyes, here ejaculated hoarsely and as if involuntarily
"Clive Belgian! You had approached him?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Mr. X., smilingly, "but I was upon the point of
doing so, when three months ago he was unfortunate enough to get
apprehended after he had shot that caretaker in Hume Buildings. I
had had my eye upon him for some time, for I was sure he would
prove a most valuable addition to our party. He was very capable,
absolutely unscrupulous, and without a grain of pity in him." He
laughed again. "You have had considerable dealings with him, have
you not, Mr. B.?" Then as the man addressed apparently showed no
intention of making any reply, he went on quickly. "But to return
to the purpose for which we are assembled here." He spoke most
impressively. "Now, straightaway, you can take it for granted,
you are all three quite secured against the treachery of one
another, for you are all engaged in unlawful undertakings, and it
would be dangerous to the last degree for any one of you
to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What about yourself?" broke in a third man sharply, an
uncommon-looking man with a high forehead and good facial angle,
but most unprepossessing appearance, because the bony
construction of his face was so pronounced, it seemed to be
stretching the livid skin that covered it, almost to breaking
point. "What about yourself? We know nothing about you?"</p>

<p>Mr. X. smiled. "But you soon shall do, my friend," he replied,
"for when I proceed to chapter and verse about the law-breaking
proclivities of you three, I shall be equally open regarding my
own." He went on. "Now within the last few weeks I have
approached each of you in turn recalling to you, firstly, that
you have each suffered at the hands of this so-called society,
under whose laws we live&mdash;as a matter of fact only one of us
here has not served a term of imprisonment, and that individual
is not I&mdash;and, secondly, that you all should have vengeances
to exact. Accordingly, I have suggested that you should join with
me to mete out&mdash;not only to the particular people concerned,
but to the community generally&mdash;the punishments that are
undoubtedly deserved." He looked from one to the other. "Now that
is the sole line I have taken, is it not, vengeance upon our
particular enemies, and, in a broad way, making the community
suffer as we have suffered?"</p>

<p>A short silence followed, and he received a nod of decisive,
if sullen, agreement from each one before he resumed. "Well,
before I approached any of you, I made sure that your
temperaments were such that you would be willing to exact your
vengeances if you could, and also, would be wholly callous to any
suffering that you inflicted." He laughed softly again. "Ah
Chung's entertainments were a good school in which to try you
out."</p>

<p>"Come to the point," growled the man with the face of tightly-drawn skin. "We are not going to stop here for ever."</p>

<p>"Patience, my friend," retorted the stout man. "I am coming to
it now." He spoke most impressively. "The exact position then is
this. We are none of us, by any means, poor men and
I&mdash;&mdash;am a very rich one. If all of you were paupers, I
have yet ample means to finance the whole project." He struck the
table lightly with his hand. "So, all I want is comrades. Men of
sufficient strength of character to help me carry out my
vengeance, along with their own. Then we shall enjoy together the
punishments we inflict." He threw out his hands. "What pleasure
is there in drinking alone, and how much greater enjoyment then
will be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But how are we to know you have the means you say you have?"
asked the fourth man brusquely. "It may be that this is only a
trap you are setting for us, and you may be only out for common
blackmail. That diamond in your ring, even, may be spurious
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The stout man instantly plucked the ring from his finger and
handed it across the table to Mr. B. "He'll tell you," he laughed
in great good humour, "for he is the biggest buyer of stolen gems
in London, and the police have been looking for him for
years."</p>

<p>Mr. B. with no expression upon his face took the ring and
examined it. "Worth &pound;200," he remarked laconically. He half
smiled. "I should give you &pound;30 cash if it came to me on the
way of business."</p>

<p>"And how could I have found out all about you that I have,"
asked the stout man, "unless I had been able to spend, and spend
freely." He shook his fat forefinger playfully at the man who had
questioned his financial stability. "Why, to find out what I have
found out about you alone, has cost me more than &pound;1000, for
I had to send a private inquiry agent expressly over to Shanghai,
and all the time I was having you watched, day by day, by other
agents over here." He looked round upon them all. "But I'll soon
convince you on the score of what means I possess. Listen, I'll
tell you a story&mdash;a story with a sequel to it."</p>

<p>No one made any comment, and after a few moments he went on.
"Now cast your minds back to 15 years ago when the Cosmopolitan
Investment Company came into the boom. A new star in finance had
appeared, Oscar Bascoigne, a man in the early thirties, and I am
sure you will all remember him. Good! Well, he floated that
company with a capital of &pound;2,000,000 and attracted the
investments of people all over the English-speaking world. He was
a dear personal friend of mine, and when he crashed and was sent
down for seven years for fraudulent company promoting, I was
perhaps the only person who grieved for him. He served more than
five years of his sentence and then was released upon ticket of
leave. He&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ought to have been a lifer," broke in the man with the
tightly drawn skin. "He deserved nothing less."</p>

<p>The stout man ignored the interruption. "&mdash;&mdash;he went
over to Santiago and there, with some thousands of pounds that he
had secreted before the crash came, made a huge fortune out of
nitrates, more than &pound;1,000,000. Then he died, leaving
everything to me, with the injunction, however, that in return I
should avenge the wrong that had been done him, for he had been
convicted under the direction of a servile and unjust Judge,
urged on by the lies and calumnies of the prosecution for the
Crown. This last fellow handed out the usual flap-doodle that
every one who had rushed in for the gamble were innocent and
confiding creatures, and that Bascoigne had robbed the widows and
the fatherless and brought ruin upon countless homes." He thumped
again upon the table. "Now do you understand my motives and
believe that I have ample means?"</p>

<p>The man with the death-mask face smiled coldly. "Yes, I
believe you," he said, "for you are Bascoigne himself, I should
not have recognised you, but I have heard you at the company's
meetings and remember now that oily voice." He spoke quite
passionlessly. "Curse you! I lost &pound;2000 that I could ill
spare at the time, and you ruined my poor old mother when your
company failed. You are a great scoundrel."</p>

<p>The stout man was by no means abashed, instead, he laughed as
if he were very amused. "And when you add to that," he said, "the
fact that in leaving England I broke my ticket-of-leave, and in
consequence there is still a warrant out for my apprehension, you
will appreciate how thoroughly I am one of you&mdash;an outcast
from society, and the prey of the Law if it can lay its hands
upon me."</p>

<p>"But you are not being open with us, as you made out you
were," said the square-jawed man angrily. "This confession that
you are Bascoigne has been forced upon you."</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Bascoigne warmly. "I could have denied
it, and our friend here had no proof. Besides, did I not commence
my little story by telling you that it had a sequel? And if you
had waited for that sequel you would have learnt at the end that
if Bascoigne, the financier, had died"&mdash;he looked very
grim&mdash;"yet as Mr. X. he has now risen from the dead to wreak
vengeance upon his enemies."</p>

<p>Then with a quick movement he thrust his hand into the pocket
of his jacket and drew out a long packet, wrapped in brown paper.
"And now for this last proof," he said sharply, as he proceeded
to draw off the wrapping. "Ten one-thousand pounds Government
bonds-to-bearer. Exactly 49 numbers between each one of them, and
I possess the lot, locked securely in my safe." His smile was
proud and arrogant. "Half a million pounds, gentlemen, and that
by no means represents the whole of my possessions. So now will
you throw in your fortunes with mine and obtain the revenges for
which I know you crave?"</p>

<p>A long silence followed, and then the man with the bony face
nodded. "Yes, I will," he said. "My liver is cirrhosed, and I
know I have not long to live. I should like to settle a few
accounts before I go."</p>

<p>"I'm willing, too," said the square-jawed man savagely. "I'd
swing happily if I could obtain all the revenge I want,
first."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said the third man, quietly. "Life is humdrum, and
it will be an adventure to punish the man who ruined me."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, as you say, life is humdrum," exclaimed Bascoigne,
excitedly, and speaking with intense passion, "and we will not
stop only at the gratification of our private vengeances, but
will wage relentless war upon the society that has hounded us
down. We will bring a chilling fear into its smug and
hypocritical heart, and from a hundred bloody deeds it shall
learn that an avenger stalks the land. We will&mdash;&mdash;" but
overcome by the vehemence of his emotion, he paused to get his
breath, and then before he could resume the boney-faced man broke
in.</p>

<p>"A drug-taker, eh? No! well you look like one to me, anyhow!"
He shrugged his shoulders. "I take chloral myself." He laughed
grimly. "Really, we shall be dangerous maniacs let loose among
the community, if we are going to act as you suggest."</p>

<p>Bascoigne pulled himself together, and his voice dropped into
crisp and business-like tones. "But now," he announced, "I'll
make all the necessary introductions."</p>

<p>Uneasy looks came at once into the faces of the other men, but
he went on emphatically. "Yes, it is absolutely necessary that we
should know all about one another, so that there may be perfect
confidence between us all, and the full realisation that any
treachery among us&mdash;and we all fall together."</p>

<p>"Well, go on," said the man who had just admitted he took
chloral, testily, "and get it over, quick. You are not addressing
the Cosmopolitan Investment Company now. You have been too
verbose all along."</p>

<p>Bascoigne bowed ironically. "Myself first, then gentlemen," he
said. "Once Convict Bascoigne, and now Sheldon Brown, Esq., of
The Pines, Crowborough, and 25 Charles Street, Mayfair. A Justice
of the Peace for the county of Sussex, and the well-known
philanthropist who gave &pound;50,000 to the London Hospital last
year. Next,"&mdash;and he turned to the last speaker&mdash;"Sir
Charles Carrion, Baronet, of 47 Harley Street, the one-time
eminent surgeon with all England at his feet. Three years
incarceration in a private lunatic asylum, however, has somewhat
detracted from his professional popularity, and his practice may
now be considered small."</p>

<p>A look of rage came into the face of Sir Charles. "I was only
certified by my rivals," he snarled savagely, "and whatever I am
now, I was perfectly sane then. It was a vile conspiracy hatched
to get me out of the way. Hell! I'd join hands with the devil
himself to get my revenge."</p>

<p>Bascoigne smiled and went on. "But Sir Charles's activities
are by no means confined to his practice in Harley Street, for he
runs an unregistered vivisection laboratory in his commodious
residence at Hampstead. He has been refused any sort of licence
by the authorities, but nevertheless operates, and without
anaesthetics, too. He has a private burial ground in the large
garden surrounding his house, and if I am not very much
mistaken," here he pretended to cough apologetically, "bodies
have been buried there that are not only those of dumb animals.
Three months ago, he had some sort of disagreement with his
butler, who was threatening to report the vivisections to the
authorities, and the next day the butler disappeared. The man was
supposed to have left the district, but I am of opinion that he
never went far away and if a certain spot behind a big elm tree
were dug over&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing would be found," broke in Sir Charles with a
contemptuous smile. "The precautions I took
were&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But the purchase of such a large quantity of chemicals would
have to be explained," interrupted Bascoigne sharply, "and you
seem not to be aware that your butler had four gold crowns, and
was wearing artificial teeth set upon a platinum plate." He
looked amused. "Now, none should know better than you that both
gold and platinum are unaffected by nitric acid."</p>

<p>Sir Charles Carrion scowled but made no comment, and Bascoigne
continued. "Well, that finishes with Sir Charles for the moment,
and from what I have just outlined, I think we others need have
no fear that tales will ever be carried to quarters where they
are not wanted. We are quite safe, I am sure."</p>

<p>He pointed now to a small dark man, with a sallow oval face
and a beard, trimmed and pointed, that suggested the artist. "And
here is another medical man, a one-time Dr. Joseph Libbeus, a
Hebrew of course, and an M.D., London." He broke off as if an
idea had struck him, and asked quickly. "Then you didn't
recognise Sir Charles, Doctor. I was half expecting you
would."</p>

<p>"No," was the quiet reply. "I have heard of him, of course,
and Humanity will always be indebted to him for his 'Surgery of
the Abdomen,' but I have never seen him before." He inclined his
head politely in the direction of Sir Charles. "He is a great
man."</p>

<p>The surgeon smiled coldly and Bascoigne continued. "Well,
fifteen years ago, Dr. Libbeus was one of the most brilliant
students who had ever qualified from St. Bartholomew's Hospital,
and before he was nine and twenty he had become a recognised
authority upon 'toxicology.'" He rubbed his hands as if very
pleased. "His knowledge of poisons will be most useful to us." He
went on. "But a great calamity overtook him, for, in financial
difficulties and tempted by the big fee of two hundred guineas,
he performed a certain operation and the woman died. He might,
however, have escaped all consequences of his action but for the
hostility of a brother practitioner, and tried at the Old Bailey,
he was sentenced to five years penal servitude, from which he
emerged six years ago. He went to Shanghai, and obtained
employment in a factory for the production of high
explosives&mdash;here, again, he is the very man we
want&mdash;but unhappily, strong suspicion arose in that city
that he had administered poison to the husband of a lady with
whom he was on friendly terms, and he was fortunate to be able to
escape from the country before matters came to a head. As much
altered in appearance as I am, because bearded, and an habitual
opium addict, he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's neither here nor there," broke in Dr. Libbeus angrily.
"I take my opium pill just as you take your alcohol or your
tobacco." He made a sharp motion with his hand. "Keep off
unnecessary personalities, please."</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;he returned to England," continued Bascoigne,
as if he had not heard the interruption, "and, as Professor
Batcher, now carries on a highly unlawful practice at 275 Queen
Ann's Street. Two of his patients have died recently, but forging
the name of a Dr. Anthony Harden of Kew, whom he has ascertained
is at the present moment travelling abroad, he has had no
difficulty in getting them interred in the customary manner."</p>

<p>Dr. Libbeus was moistening his dry lips with his tongue and
his face had gone an ashen grey, but Sir Charles Carrion looked
highly amused.</p>

<p>"A most excellent joke!" he chuckled. "Most excellent! It
happens I know Harden quite well, and his eyes would pop out in
horror if he knew what had been certified over his name. He is a
smug, sanctimonious man, and the acme of unctuous
respectability." He turned and patted Dr. Libbeus in a most
friendly fashion upon the shoulder. "But see here, sir&mdash;next
time you want a certificate of death, come straight to me and
I'll give it you. Then you won't be running any risks. I'm not
fussy and shall be quite prepared to certify to anything you
want."</p>

<p>Dr. Libbeus at once recovered his composure and the blood
returned to his face. "Thank you very much indeed, Sir Charles,"
he said warmly, "I shall be most grateful to you."</p>

<p>Bascoigne rubbed his hands together again. "That's right," he
said gleefully. "I was certain we should all become good
friends." He turned to the fourth man, the one with the
determined jaw. "Now for Mr. Edward Mason, a prosperous estate-agent of Mile End Road. His real name is Sabine Guildford, and he
is, or was, a member of the legal profession, but in 1915 he
speculated with funds entrusted to his care and an unsympathetic
judge ordered him free board and lodging for five years at the
expense of his Majesty. Of course, too, he was struck off the
Rolls."</p>

<p>"If they had given me three weeks' grace," interrupted
Guildford fiercely, "they would have got back every penny I took,
for the investment righted itself. But the Law Society would have
its pound of flesh."</p>

<p>"Exactly," agreed Bascoigne, "it was the Law Society that
drove you into the paths you subsequently took." He turned back
to the others. "Well, at the expiration of his sentence, our
friend proceeded to make his home in Mile End Road, and, with his
profound knowledge of law, his enterprise, and his undoubted
business ability, soon became a person of importance in the
circle in which he now moves."</p>

<p>Guildford began to stir uneasily in his chair here and
Bascoigne went on. "He is a blackmailer, he finances the elite of
the criminal classes, and his house is a hiding place for them
when they are pursued. He is a receiver of stolen goods, he is
engaged in the dope traffic, and he forges passports for entry
into every country in the world. Also, when the occasion is
propitious, he does not hesitate to embark upon criminal
adventures of his own." He laughed merrily. "That is so, Mr.
Guildford, is it not?"</p>

<p>Guildford's face had assumed an ugly look and his beady eyes
were blinking viciously. "Go on," he growled, "you seem to know
more about me than I know myself."</p>

<p>Bascoigne beamed good humour and good nature. "But I have told
you I have made it my business to find out everything about you
all, and there is no exaggeration in anything I say." He spoke
banteringly. "At any rate you must admit that for 10 days prior
to the burglary at Lord Farleigh's at Stoke d'Aberon last month,
and the very violent death of his gardener in the
grounds&mdash;you were occupying that little cottage you rent in
Oxshott Woods, close by, and you cannot deny that you had been
making mysterious excursions from there in the dead of night,
upon three or four occasions just before the burglary occurred."
He pretended to look very grave. "So, the authorities if they are
aware of it, might perhaps be inclined to think that you have
been spying out the ground."</p>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.<br>

THE DRUMS OF WAR.</h2>

<p class="first">ONE Sunday afternoon towards the end of
September, about three months after the events recorded in the
last chapter, two men were seated in the crowded winter-garden of
the Hotel Metropole at Brighton. One of them was a journalist,
attached to the London 'Daily Cry,' and the other, a rubber
planter, home on holiday from the Federated Malay States. The
latter was reading a Sunday newspaper, and presently he threw it
down.</p>

<p>"Well, really," he remarked carelessly, "this dear old England
of ours does not seem the law-abiding place it used to be, and
certainly its police are not nearly as efficient as in days gone
by." His voice rose a little. "Why, here have I been home not a
couple of months until next week, and yet I can recall at least
four unsolved murders, and also a mysterious disappearance that
looks darned like foul-play, too." He held out the newspaper to
his companion. "And here's another outrage, I see, reported this
morning, some one shooting at Lord Cornwall's car yesterday at
Barnstead, and a bullet going through the window. What the devil
was that done for, I wonder?"</p>

<p>The journalist declined the proferred paper. "I've already
seen it, old man," he said. "It's interesting, but was possibly
only an accident. Some one rabbiting, perhaps, on the common as
the car went by, and maybe he didn't know what he had done."</p>

<p>"And when that clergyman was shot at Surbiton," remarked the
planter sarcastically, "I suppose that was an accident, too! And
when the old judge was killed at Eastbourne, and Lord Burkington
at Harrogate&mdash;both accidents again!"</p>

<p>The journalist shook his head. "No, cold-blooded murders
there," he said instantly, "and very mysterious, too." He
shrugged his shoulders. "Still, among 50 million persons
mysterious things are always happening, although, naturally, we
don't always hear about them."</p>

<p>"But has it struck you, Travers," went on the planter, "that
most of these johnnies who have struck trouble lately were at one
time or other prominent in the particular circles in which they
moved."</p>

<p>The journalist laughed. "Of course it has," he replied, "and
that is why we remember about them. If Bill Bloggs had been
killed in Whitechapel or Sam Stuckey at Mile End, matters might
have been dismissed in two paragraphs and forgotten in two days,
but the more prominent the person, naturally the more interested
the public are when anything happens to him,"&mdash;he made a
grimace&mdash;"and we newspaper men have to provide what they
want. We cater for those interests."</p>

<p>"Well, your police must be pretty rotten, anyhow," said the
planter, "to have made no discoveries at all."</p>

<p>The journalist laughed again. "And how do you know they
haven't made any discoveries?" he asked. He nodded. "You be here
another month, my friend, and then note how many of those
mysteries are in the way of being cleared up."</p>

<p><br>
A SHORT silence followed, and the two friends interested
themselves in regarding the company around them. It was the usual
Sunday afternoon crowd of well-dressed men and beautifully-gowned
women. People well known in society, business and professional
men, people known in the art and literary worlds, owners of
racehorses and sporting men, and a sprinkling of politicians.</p>

<p>"Well, and what do you think of them?" asked the journalist
presently, turning back to his companion. "Notice any difference
in the ten years you've been away?"</p>

<p>"No-o," replied the rubber planter hesitatingly, "except that
there are more women smoking now, and the sweet creatures are
more made-up than ever." He nodded appreciatively. "There are
some lovely women here."</p>

<p>"Yes, lovely," agreed the journalist readily. He lowered his
voice quickly. "Now, that girl opposite you is a perfect poem
isn't she? Did you ever see more glorious eyes or a more
beautiful profile? She's Lady Beeming, and that's her husband,
not her grandfather sitting next to her. She's 20 and he's 65,
and you'd swear from her appearance that the blood of a long line
of noble ancestors ran through her veins." He smiled drily. "But
you'd be quite mistaken, for her parents were little green-grocers in Hoxton, and three years ago, before she went into the
chorus at Sadler's Wells she was assisting in the shop
and&mdash;&mdash;" he broke off suddenly and nodded in the
direction of a tall, gaunt man, who had just passed their table,
"But look! There's a party who is just as hideous as she is
lovely!"</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked the planter. "He looks a near relation of
Satan to me."</p>

<p>"Sir Charles Carrion," whispered the journalist, "and once one
of the world's greatest surgeons. Crowned heads were among his
patients, and in abdominal surgery he was the mightiest wielder
of the knife. But his success was a cup of poison to him and some
years ago, he had a nervous breakdown, and dropped out of things
altogether. He looks a corpse now, but, funnily enough, he's
returned into society lately, and I'm always running up against
him in my work. Ascot, Goodwood, Cowes&mdash;you see him
everywhere."</p>

<p>"Go on," said his friend. "Tell me about some of the other
people here. I don't mind a few lies as long as they are
interesting."</p>

<p>The journalist pretended to look very angry. "Now, I've a
darned good mind not to say another word, but as you shall now
pay for this show, and I'm going to have another brandy, I'll
overlook it this time." He looked round the spacious winter-garden. "Now, let me see. Whom else do I know? Ah! there's
somebody interesting, if you like, that rather pretty looking
man, sitting at that table alone, and appearing so bored. Now
what would you make of him?"</p>

<p>His friend looked in the direction indicated. "An artist," he
replied after a moment. "Good-looking himself, and certainly a
lover of the beautiful."</p>

<p>"Exactly," nodded the journalist, "and a purloiner of it,
too." He spoke impressively. "That man, my friend, hails from
Paris, and until recently was supposed to be one of the most
active and expert thieves in France&mdash;Raphael Croupin.
Haven't you heard of him?"</p>

<p>The planter shook his head. "A gaol bird!" he frowned. "Well,
he doesn't look like one. What's he doing here?"</p>

<p>"Oh! he's quite respectable and a rich man now," the other
laughed. "One of his admirers, a wealthy old countess, died at
the beginning of this year and left him a huge fortune, but
before that, as I say, it was believed everywhere that he was a
burglar&mdash;if a burglar of a very uncommon kind. He only took
paintings of the old masters, old tapestries, historic jewels,
and art treasures of great value. It was believed to be well-known to the authorities what he was doing, but they were never
able to bring the robberies home to him. He has been up for trial
three times and acquitted upon each occasion, because of water-tight alibies that could not be broken down. It was the joke of
all France, and he was really a most popular character, for he
only stole from the very rich and disbursed large sums in charity
to the hospitals and among the very poor."</p>

<p>The planter looked very amused. "Continue, my dear Travers,"
he said smilingly. "You are most entertaining. Any more
celebrities here?"</p>

<p>His friend looked round. "Yes," he said, "there's a Cabinet
Minister over there, Lord Ransome, that rather stout man,
threading his way through the tables. He's the Home Secretary,
and that's his daughter with him. Oh! oh!"&mdash;he exclaimed,
becoming all at once quite animated&mdash;"now, there's some
romance for you. See the people he's sitting down with? Well,
they are Gilbert Larose, and his wife, who was once the wealthy
widow, Lady Ardane." He gripped his companion by the arm. "Two
years ago, Travers, that man was just an ordinary policeman, a
detective who used to be sent anywhere and everywhere by Scotland
Yard, and now, to-day, he's married to one of the richest women
in the kingdom, and lives almost in royal state at Carmel Abbey
in Norfolk."</p>

<p>"I've heard of him," said the planter, very interested. "He
was the star detective of Australia." He drew in a deep breath.
"Gad! his wife's beautiful! I always did admire red hair. What a
lovely creature!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and there were scores of people who wanted her," added
the journalist, "and would have taken her without a penny piece,
because of the beauty of that red head. She might have married
into the peerage any day." He sighed. "Larose is a lucky
fellow."</p>

<p>"But how did he manage it?" asked his friend.</p>

<p>"Merit, my boy, just merit," was the instant reply, "and he
deserves everything he's got, for he won her in the old-fashioned
way, by saving her from her enemies. She was kidnapped and he
rescued her at the risk of his own life, which, however, was
nothing to him, for in his career he's been in more dangers than
anyone can conceive." He sighed again. "Yes, it was a real love-match and they worship each other and the red-haired little
daughter that's come."</p>

<p>"And good luck to him!" said the planter. "He looks a
gentleman and a man of fine character." He screwed up his eyes.
"But how did people take it? What did society say?"</p>

<p>"Society!" laughed the journalist. "Well, Society was aghast!"
His voice hardened. "But if anyone thought they were going to put
one over Gilbert Larose, they were very much mistaken, for he
just dropped into his place as if he'd been born to it. A strong
character, nice manners, and a charming personality, he won over
everybody at once, and to-day, at any public function in Norfolk,
he's the biggest 'draw' you can get. Next to Royalty, he's the
most popular attraction at any show, and his wife's immensely
proud of him."</p>

<p>"A policeman once," commented the planter after a moment's
silence, "and now that old aristocrat is smiling at him, almost
as if he had a boon to crave."</p>

<p>And had he only known it, the planter from Malay was quite
right then, for although Lord Ransome had entered the winter-garden with no idea of meeting Gilbert Larose, the instant he had
caught sight of him and his wife, he had immediately stopped, of
set purpose, and with a gallant bow to Mrs. Larose, had held out
his hand to her.</p>

<p>"And may we join you?" he asked, and at once receiving
permission, he went on smilingly. "I see you are just as charming
as ever, Mrs. Larose, and you don't look a day older than when I
fell in love with your portrait in the academy&mdash;let me see,
it must be six or seven years ago."</p>

<p>Mrs. Larose shook her head reprovingly. "Now, that's not nice
of you, Lord Ransome," she laughed, "to remind me all that time
has passed. You don't seem to realise that I am now fighting the
years."</p>

<p>"No, I certainly do not," laughed back his lordship, "for
there are no signs of warfare about you." He bowed again. "I am
sure I can congratulate your distinguished husband upon the care
he is taking of you." He turned to Larose. "Ah! that reminds me,
sir, I've heard you're a most outstanding success upon the Bench.
My friend, the Chief Constable of Norfolk, informs me that
offenders are delighted to be brought up before you,"&mdash;he
made a grimace&mdash;"for you either pay their fines yourself or
let them off altogether."</p>

<p>"Oh! no," laughed Larose, "it's not quite as bad as that, Lord
Ransome. Certainly, I always&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he's not complaining," broke in his lordship quickly. "On
the contrary, for he says you are exerting a most splendid
influence, and it has become almost a point of honour with the
offenders not to be brought up again. For instance, I understand
that there is no poaching at all now within many miles of Carmel
Abbey."</p>

<p>"But my husband bribes them," smiled Mrs. Larose. "He gives
them all a day's shooting every now and then, and makes me send
out lunch, too," she shook her head. "He's breaking all
traditions and I can't do anything with him."</p>

<p>They chatted animatedly together for a few minutes, Mrs.
Larose telling of the delightful holiday she and her husband had
been having for nearly three months in Switzerland, and how they
had arrived only the previous day at Newhaven and were proceeding
home on the morrow to Carmel Abbey. Then Lord Ransome turned to
Larose and remarked carelessly, "Well, it's rather fortunate I
met you here this afternoon, for I've been wanting for some time
to have a little talk with you about your greyhounds. I have
thought of entering one of mine for the Waterloo Cup, and should
be most grateful to you for some advice." He made an almost
imperceptible movement with his eyebrows. "Now, what about coming
up to my room for a few minutes? I am sure the ladies will excuse
us."</p>

<p>Larose regarded the great man curiously. He had only met him
once before, and was sure, upon such a slight acquaintanceship,
the Home Secretary would not now be inviting him to a private
talk unless for some particular purpose quite unconnected with
dogs. He had noted the expressive movement of the eyebrows,
however, and so at once, falling in with the suggestion, rose
from his chair and proceeded to accompany his lordship from the
winter garden.</p>

<p><br>
THEY ascended a few floors in the lift, and then, in a cosy
little private sitting room, Lord Ransome motioned him to an
armchair. His lordship had become all at once a very different
man to the genial and bowing courtier of the winter garden. His
bearing now was one of authority, and his features set in stern
and uncompromising lines he looked the outstanding personality in
politics that he was. He opened the conversation at once.</p>

<p>"Mr. Larose," he said solemnly, "it was Fate or Providence
that took me into the winter garden just now, for you have been a
lot in my mind during the last twenty-four hours, and, indeed, I
was intending, in any case, to get in touch with you tomorrow."
He eyed him intently. "Now, did your ears burn last night? No!
Well, they ought to have done, for quite a number of people were
talking about you,"&mdash;he spoke impressively&mdash;"and in not
unexalted circles either." He waited a moment to let the
information soak in, and then rapped out&mdash;</p>

<p>"You're wanted back in Scotland Yard, my friend. That's the
trouble. You've got to get back into harness again."</p>

<p>Larose looked very astonished and sat bolt upright in his
chair. He had certainly been expecting some confidence, but not a
request of that nature and, for the moment, it quite took his
breath away.</p>

<p>Lord Ransome glanced quickly at his watch and went on. "Now,
we can only stay here about twenty minutes, for it'll be unwise
to absent ourselves longer. Heaven only knows who's in that
winter garden, and I don't want to see any tittle-tattle in the
newspapers to-morrow, that the Secretary of State for Home
Affairs and Mr. Gilbert Larose were closetted together for two
hours. No, there must be none of that, for happenings are
occurring that must be dealt with in the utmost secrecy." He
hooded his eyes under his shaggy brows. "Then you don't guess why
you are wanted back?"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "I am out of touch altogether with
things over here," he replied. "We have been tucked away for
nearly three months in the heart of the Bernese Oberland and have
heard very little news."</p>

<p>"But haven't you read in the Swiss newspapers," asked Lord
Ransome incredulously, "what's been happening over here?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Larose quickly. "You see, sir, we
didn't often get newspapers where we were, and when they did come
they gave very little English news. What is it, you say, has
happened?"</p>

<p>"Then you didn't hear," asked his lordship, "that Sir John
Lorraine had been murdered?"</p>

<p>"The judge!" exclaimed Larose. "Oh! yes, I heard of that and
also that Lord Burkington had been shot."</p>

<p>Lord Ransome looked scornful. "Those are only two of our
problems," he said sharply. "We heard many others." He rose
abruptly from his chair and going over to a suitcase, unlocked
it, and after a few moments' search abstracted a sheet of paper
from among others in a bulky packet. "See, here, Mr. Larose," he
said, shaking his head angrily. "To put it bluntly&mdash;six
persons have been murdered in the last ten weeks, and in not one
single instance have the local police or Scotland Yard been able
to lay hands upon the murderers, also&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Six!" broke in Larose. "All in the same neighbourhood!"</p>

<p>"No," was the testy reply, "all over the country, also, as I
was about to add when you interrupted, it is by chance, only,
that wholesale destruction has not followed upon further outrages
of a most terrible nature." He lowered his voice very solemnly.
"But the sinister aspect of the whole thing is&mdash;we know now
we are facing what is undoubtedly the unfinished series of these
dreadful crimes, for within the last few days it has come to our
knowledge in a most strange and startling manner that these
widely-scattered outrages may not be considered as isolated
happenings, but are the work of a gang of individuals who for
some mad reason are declaring war upon the community."</p>

<p>The heart of Larose gave a great bound. He was like an old
war-horse who hears the rumbling of the guns.</p>

<p>Lord Ransome nodded angrily. "Yes, and it is childish for some
very superior persons to insist that the idea is far-fetched that
such a gang can exist." His eyes glared. "Why, in every country
of the world there are people who think they have been badly
treated and who would inflict any injury they could upon their
fellow men if they got the chance. So it has only to happen that
a number of such wretches become acquainted and learn the bent of
one another's minds for them to pool their common hatreds to
obtain revenge."</p>

<p>He laid the paper upon the table and, beckoning to Larose to
come nearer, pointed with one long and white forefinger.</p>

<p>"Here is the complete list," he said, "up to Thursday last, as
tabulated for me by the Chief Commissioner of Police. Look,
number one&mdash;the Honourable Sir John Lorraine, of Merton
Court, Eastbourne. Age 74. Murdered on July 25th last. Bludgeoned
in broad daylight in a lane, close near his home. Number
two&mdash;Archdeacon Lendon, of Canterbury. Age 63. Shot, when
sitting on the lawn of Mrs. Fox-Drummond's house at Surbiton.
Number three&mdash;Lord Burkington, of The Hall, Harrogate. Age
65. Shot through the broken window of his own dining-room on
August 25th. Number four&mdash;Dr. Bellew of Great Leighs, Essex.
Age 65. Stabbed to death in his garden with a knife wound through
his heart!"</p>

<p>He went on. "Number five&mdash;Anthony Clutterbuck, of York
Terrace, Regents Park and Chancery Lane. The well-known
solicitor. Age 62. Last seen upon the seawall of Canvey Island on
the afternoon of September 12th, but his broken and bloodied
spectacles and a bloodied glove, picked up later in one of the
adjoining fields, point most unmistakably to foul play and that
his body was thrown into the sea. Number six&mdash;Mr. Samuel
Wiggins, of Leigh-on-Sea. Age 62. A retired tea-broker. Stabbed
to death on the Esplanade there on the night of September
13th."</p>

<p>He tapped the paper with his finger. "Those are their
successes, Mr. Larose," he said grimly, "and their
failures&mdash;an attack upon Lord Cornwall yesterday, when two
bullets, not one, as reported, struck his car&mdash;a large bomb
that did not go off in St. Paul's Cathedral, and an abortive
attempt to throw some twenty-odd pounds of arsenic into the
Kingston Reservoir." He nodded. "But I am giving you inside
information now, and neither of these two last happenings has
been reported in the Press."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" exclaimed Larose, his eyes glued to the paper,
"what a dreadful list!" He looked up quickly and asked, "but what
happened to the bomb?"</p>

<p>"The clockwork arrangement stopped," replied Lord Ransome.
"The bomb was brought into the cathedral on the Saturday
afternoon, three weeks ago, and left under one of the seats. It
was flat in shape, with its covering of canvas painted to exactly
harmonise with the stone floor. The hand of the clock was set to
go off at half-past eleven on the Sunday morning." He drew in a
deep breath. "Oh! it was damnable! It would have exploded in the
middle of Divine Service."</p>

<p>"And that attempt to poison the reservoir?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Was foiled by the merest chance," was the reply, "and it came
about like this. An old clergyman living close near the reservoir
had lost his parrot, and as he had offered a reward for its
recovery all the boys in the neighbourhood were on the look out
for it, and two of them about nine o'clock at night on the
Saturday of the week before last climbed over the high fence
surrounding the reservoir on the chance of finding the bird
inside. Imagine then their surprise when, upon flashing a torch,
they saw a man there at the edge of the water, just in the act of
untying a small sack. The man dropped the sack and bolted
instantly upon seeing their light, and if he had not done so the
boys would undoubtedly have bolted themselves, for they took him
to be the watchman of the reservoir. Hearing him, however,
scrambling over the fence, they realised that he was only a
trespasser like themselves, and, of course, ran up to see what
the sack contained."</p>

<p>Larose listened to the story of the attempt to poison the
reservoir and how the man had fled. "But," he asked, "didn't the
man see that his interrupters were only boys?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Lord Ransome. "It was pitch dark and all the man
knew was that a light was being flashed upon him." He went on.
"Well, the boys could make nothing of the white powder in the
sack, and leaving it where it was they climbed back"&mdash;he
smiled here&mdash;"to jump almost into the arms of a policeman
who happened to be passing at the moment. Then, frightened as to
what might be the consequences of their trespassing, they told
the policeman exactly what they had seen. The latter was an alert
and intelligent officer, and, taking the boys with him he aroused
the watchman, and their story being investigated, it was speedily
realised what an awful calamity had been so narrowly
averted."</p>

<p>"Nothing more heard of the man, of course?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied his lordship, "he had just disappeared,
and, as in all the other cases, not the faintest clue as to his
identity had been left behind." He raised his hand solemnly. "Now
comes a most extraordinary disclosure, and my story harks back to
a certain Sunday morning, June 29th to be exact at the Gibbett
Inn, a little hostelry on the Ashbourne Forest Road, midway
between Hartfield and Maresfield, in Sussex."</p>

<p>He leant back in his chair and now from the expression upon
his face it seemed that for the moment the anxieties of the
statesman were forgotten in the pleasure of the raconteur who had
a good story to tell.</p>

<p>He went on. "Well, it appears that this Gibbett Inn caters for
quite a number of lunching parties on Sundays, and on that
particular morning, just prior to the time when the customers
were due to arrive, the eldest child of the inn-keeper, a young
girl, was impertinent to her mother, and in consequence her
father was summoned to administer chastisement. The girl,
however, to escape the promised punishment, hid herself away, and
chose for her hiding place an old fashioned ottoman in the large
dining-room, where all the meals of the visitors are served."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment to enjoy the frowning and puzzled
expression upon the face of Larose. For the life of him the
latter could not surmise what he was going to be told next. Lord
Ransome continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"The girl says she must have at once then fallen asleep. Next
her story runs that she woke up and overheard parts of the
conversation of four men, and this conversation, she avers, was
all about certain people who were going to be punished. They were
to be shot, or violence of some other kind was to be done to
them." He nodded. "Mind you, she explains she couldn't hear
everything that was said, and only scraps of the conversation
reached her. Also, she couldn't see who was speaking, either,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How then does she know there were four men?" asked Larose
sharply.</p>

<p>"Because of the voices," replied Lord Ransome, "and also,
because through a crack in the side of the ottoman, she had a
view of the greater part of the room and could only see four
pairs of legs. The men, too, were close near her, but the sound
of their voices was muffled, because, of course, the lid of the
ottoman was shut down."</p>

<p>"How did she breathe?" asked Larose, as if determined to
verify the story as it went along.</p>

<p>"There was no side to the ottoman, where it touched the wall,"
replied Lord Ransome. He nodded. "You can rest assured the girl's
tale has been tested in every way. Well, as she heard the men
talking, she distinctly caught the names of two persons they were
speaking about, Lord Burkington's and Anthony Clutterbuck's, also
she heard them mention various public buildings, including St.
Paul's' Cathedral and the British Museum, and she says one of the
men had a low laugh, like that of a madman on the talkies."</p>

<p>"And when did you learn all this?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Only last week," replied Lord Ransome, "in a communication
from the police constable at Maresfield, which communication,
indeed, he could have given us nearly two months ago." He
shrugged his shoulders. "Of course, it is easy to blame the man
now, but I really don't see that there was any neglect of duty,
for he heard the girl's story weeks after the event had happened,
and then only in such a casual sort of way that he attached no
importance to it. You see, she ran away from her home that Sunday
afternoon without saying anything, and it was ten days before her
parents discovered she was staying with an old school friend at
Eastbourne. Then, when she was brought back, she sulked for
several days, and in consequence, it was quite three weeks after
she had heard the conversation before she told her father about
it, and later, he came to mention it casually across the bar-counter to the village policeman.</p>

<p>"And what did the policeman do then?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Lord Ransome. "The girl was out upon her
bicycle at the time he came into the bar, and he didn't think it
worth while to wait until she came in and question her. In fact,
he says frankly, he didn't believe the story, and thought it all
an invention upon her part, but"&mdash;his lordship nodded
impressively&mdash;"he happened to remember the two names and
when first Lord Burkington was murdered, and later this man,
Clutterbuck, the story came back to him in a flash, and he went
post-haste up to the inn to interview the girl and make
inquiries."</p>

<p>"And of course," commented Larose quickly, "after all that
lapse of time, no description was forthcoming of any of the four
men?"</p>

<p>"None whatever," replied Lord Ransome, "for the officers who
were of course, immediately sent down to The Gibbett Inn,
reported that the waitresses were women of no memory or
intelligence, although the little girl was as sharp as a needle."
He shrugged his shoulders. "But she could add nothing to what she
had already told her father and the police constable. She had
heard the voices and seen the four pairs of legs&mdash;and that
was all."</p>

<p>"Hum!" remarked Larose thoughtfully. "A funny place to choose
for hatching a conspiracy, the public dining-room of a way-side
inn!" He nodded. "Still, if the girl's story can be depended
upon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And it can be depended upon," broke in Lord Ransome
emphatically. He threw out his hands. "How else could she have
picked up the two names&mdash;weeks before anything happened to
their owners."</p>

<p>A long silence followed, and then Larose nodded grimly, "All
right sir," he said. "I'll take it on." His eyes gleamed. "But I
want a free hand, and to be allowed to go about it in my own
way!"</p>

<p>Lord Ransome looked very pleased, and nodded emphatically.
"Certainly," he replied, "and whatsoever eventuates we shall be
very much beholden to you." He shook his head. "Of course, I
realise that the question of remuneration will not enter into the
matter at all, and your sole reward will be that of the hunter in
the chase." He rose up from his chair. "But, really, it's a
pleasure to do business with a gentleman who makes up his mind so
quickly. Well, you'll report to Scotland Yard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"On Thursday," said Larose. "You must give me until then."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Lord Ransome, "and now we'll go back to that
winter garden." He moved to the door, and then paused, with his
hand upon the handle. "But, think," he went on impressively, "of
the service you will be rendering to the country if you uncover
this gang of madmen, for started now upon their course of revenge
we never know from hour to hour what new outrage is not going to
be reported." He shook his head. "But I'm afraid the Yard won't
have much information to give you, for there were no clues that
they could find to pick up, and no trails that they could see to
follow. The murders were all committed with dreadful suddenness,
and there were no eye-witnesses about to relate what happened.
Just the whine of the bullet, the stab with the knife, or the
crash with the bludgeon, and the miscreants disappeared as
mysteriously and silently as they had come." He bowed smilingly,
"Surely an ideal task for the incomparable Gilbert Larose!"</p>

<p>Some three minutes later Lord Ransome returned to where his
daughter and Mrs. Larose were sitting in the winter garden. "But
where is my husband?" asked the latter at once. "What have you
done with him?"</p>

<p>"Oh! he's just stopped to speak to a gentleman in the lounge,"
replied Lord Ransome, "and from the warmth of their greeting they
must be old friends."</p>

<p>And certainly the greeting between Larose and Raphael Croupin
had been a warm one, for notwithstanding the very differing
natures of their former activities there was a mutual liking
between them. If Croupin were a rogue, he was always a humorous
one, and, apart from his rogueries, a very likeable fellow.</p>

<p>"And what are you doing over here, Monsieur Croupin?" asked
Larose, his face becoming serious, and with just a trace of
suspicion in his tones.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Croupin with a tremendous sigh, "and I am
very bored." He shot a quick glance at Larose, and added slyly,
"I'm quite rich now, Monsieur. I have come into money."</p>

<p>"Whose?" asked Larose drily.</p>

<p>Croupin opened his eyes widely as if he were very surprised.
"Oh! it is my own," he replied instantly. "All my very own." He
looked rather hurt. "No, no, Meester Larose, there is none of
that now, for I am of a character quite reformed." He spoke with
great earnestness. "Why! I have even given compensation when
people have proved that they are poor, because&mdash;" he coughed
diffidently, "of the loss of possessions I am credited with as
having illegally acquired." He drew himself up proudly. "Yes, I
am rich now, for I have a large estate, the gift of a dear friend
who died."</p>

<p>"And what are you going to do, then?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"I don't know," was the sad reply. He shook his head. "Life
has no spice in it now, there is no adventure, no danger,
and&mdash;&mdash;" he shrugged his shoulders, "but it is the same
with you, is it not? You are certain each to-day that nothing is
going to happen each to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know whether I am," replied Larose quickly. "I'm
not so sure then." A thought seemed suddenly to strike him and he
asked sharply, "Where are you staying, here in Brighton?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Croupin, "in London, at the Savoy. I have a
suite of rooms there."</p>

<p>"A suite of rooms at the Savoy!" exclaimed Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur," replied Croupin modestly. "I told you I was
very rich."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Larose. "Then I'll take lunch with you there at 1
o'clock on Thursday,"&mdash;he lowered his voice to a
whisper&mdash;"and you may be able to be of service to me.
Adventure, perhaps, Monsieur, for I am back in harness again." He
nodded solemnly. "A bullet in your head, or a dagger in your
heart&mdash;if only we can pick up a certain trail."</p>

<p>Croupin beamed with delight. "Bien!" he exclaimed, "but it
will be a pleasure whatever happens, Meester Larose, if I am
working with you." He snapped his fingers together. "I am weary
of no one thirsting for my blood."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.<br>

LAROSE UPON THE TRAIL.</h2>

<p class="first">"OF course," said the Chief Commissioner of
Police when the following Thursday morning Larose was discussing
things with him in Scotland Yard, "we are not dealing with
ordinary criminals here, and, from the very first, we suspected
the motives behind these killings to be ones of revenge. Then, as
they went on, long before we heard the story of Cynthia Cramm, we
were certain of it. All the parties concerned, except that Samuel
Wiggins of Leigh-on-Sea were, or had been public men, and in
positions to excite enmity in unbalanced minds, particularly so
Sir John Lorraine, as an ex-judge of the Criminal Courts. Apart
from that, too, where opportunity had occurred, there had been no
robbery from the person after any of the murders had been
done."</p>

<p>"The series of crimes may have began with acts of private
vengeance," commented Larose, "but now its manifestations seem to
be merging into a general expression of hatred against the
community." He spoke very thoughtfully. "That means, surely, that
the assassins at one time or other have suffered public
humiliation, that they have been socially ostracised, or maybe,
even undergone terms of imprisonment with the entire approval of
every one."</p>

<p>"Exactly," agreed the commissioner, "we are dealing therefore
with the most dangerous type of criminal&mdash;fanatics who will
strike here, there, and everywhere, and who are hampered very
little by the risks they are running."</p>

<p>"And assuming," went on Larose, "that the men they have killed
were instrumental in bringing them to justice, or were in some
way connected with the punishments they received, then it is
probable those punishments were inflicted some time ago, for we
notice they have been taking their revenge upon people getting up
in years, all over sixty in fact."</p>

<p>"We considered that point," said the commissioner, "for three
of the victims have retired from their professions, upwards of
five years ago." He nodded. "Yes, that past is being raked up
here."</p>

<p>"Then it all amounts to this," said Larose. "We have to
uncover four men," he paused for a moment "&mdash;of the better
nourished class, because they have a preference for the best
quality of port wine and a choice in liqueurs&mdash;in command of
ample means, because they are able to travel about the country to
accomplish their ends&mdash;and of outward appearance of
respectability, because the girl says their footwear was of an
expensive kind, and their trousers were well creased." He laughed
softly. "Not much to go upon, is it?"</p>

<p>"But you have seen in the reports that have been furnished
you," replied the Commissioner a little testily, "that in not one
single instance have we been able to light upon the ghost of any
clue." He shrugged his shoulders. "Why these poor men have been
killed we are equally in the dark, although the life-history of
each one of them has been minutely gone into, to ascertain, of
course, what probable enemy he may have had. In the case of Sir
John Lorraine, for instance, all the prisoners he has sentenced
and whose terms of imprisonment have expired recently have been
accounted for, but with no profit to us in any way."</p>

<p>"But the elderly clergyman," asked Larose, looking very
puzzled, "how possibly could he have offended to the extent of
any one wanting to take his life?"</p>

<p>"Or the two medical men either, for the matter of that," said
the Commissioner, shaking his head. "Lord Burkington was a very
honoured member of his profession, and Dr. Bellew, a benevolent
old gentleman, who in his day had been a most reputable leading
women's physician."</p>

<p>"And there were no eye-witnesses," went on Larose musingly,
"of the actual committing of any of these murders?"</p>

<p>The Commissioner shook his head. "No, no one has been near any
of these people when they have died," he replied impressively.
"No one either, has seen any suspicious strangers about, either
before or after the crimes; no one has heard a cry, or the report
of the rifle, even, when a rifle has been used. Just the dead
bodies of five of them have been found, as silent and
uncommunicative as if there were no tale that could be told." He
smiled pathetically. "It is most heart-breaking, for the public
will soon be clamouring for our blood, and I almost jump out of
my shoes every time the telephone rings, thinking that another
killing is coming through. Thank heaven, Parliament is not
sitting now, or there would be a lot of questions asked."</p>

<p>A long silence followed, and then Larose got up from his
chair. "Well, I think I'll be going now," he said, "to have my
little talk with that girl at the Gibbett Inn, for it seems that
there is the only hope of picking up any trail."</p>

<p>"And I wish you luck," said the Commissioner heartily,
"although our best men have been to the inn and pumped everybody
dry. But I'll have to give you a note of introduction to the
landlord," he added, "for they have all been sworn to silence.
Luckily Cramm himself is a taciturn man by nature, and so far
nothing has leaked out to the public of the girl's story." He
spoke sharply. "Now, which of our men would you like to take with
you?"</p>

<p>"None of them," replied Larose promptly, "and I'll get you,
please, to make out the introduction for a plain Mr. Smith, for I
don't want it to become known that I'm on the job." He smiled.
"I'm a married man now, and as these four gentlemen appear to be
so very enterprising, it's quite possible if they learn that I'm
about they may be paying a visit to Carmel Abbey and taking a pot
shot at some one there."</p>

<p>Larose found Croupin eagerly awaiting him in the lounge of the
Savoy, and over a good lunch explained to him upon what mission
he was going, and suggested that the Frenchman should drive them
both in his new car and give what help he could.</p>

<p>Croupin was delighted, and indeed he could not have appeared
more happy if another dear friend of his had died and bequeathed
him another large inheritance.</p>

<p>"And it is from this young girl," he exclaimed, excitedly,
"that you expect to learn everything." His voice thrilled.
"Perhaps she is beautiful, and from Beauty's lips will then fall
the words that summon these monsters to the scaffold."</p>

<p>"But you mustn't speak to her," said Larose, with a smile.
"You must wait outside, or talk to her parents about the
weather."'</p>

<p>For the moment Croupin looked very disappointed, but then his
face brightened. "Ah! well," he exclaimed cheerfully, "then I
will talk to her mother. Perhaps she will be beautiful also, and
I have always eyes for your rosebud country beauty"&mdash;he
shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"if it is of course, not too full
blown."</p>

<p>Larose eyed the exquisitely dressed Frenchman up and down.
"And you'll please change those clothes of yours," he said
sternly, "or else cover them over with a dust-coat, and you're to
wear a proper chauffeur's cap. Also, please take off that emerald
ring. You are not coming out with me, as a rich milord of
France." He grinned. "You are going to be my chauffeur, and I
shall call you Sam."</p>

<p>Croupin made a grimace, but replied meekly enough. "All right,
Meester Larose, I will take any orders from you, because you have
promised me some danger and some fun."</p>

<p>He coughed slightly. "One thing however, I should like to
mention. Although I shall of course always be Raphael Croupin to
you, still I might inform you that upon coming into my
inheritance I adopted my mother's maiden name, and am now known
is Raphael de Croisy-Hautville." He laughed softly. "By that
means, perhaps, I thought the reputation of one Raphael Croupin,
might the sooner be forgotten."</p>

<p>"Good gracious, Monsieur!" exclaimed Larose in some surprise.
"An aristocrat, are you?"</p>

<p>"My mother's father," assented Croupin modestly, "was the
Count Robert de Croisy-Hautville and a member of the old
nobility."</p>

<p>Towards four o'clock in the afternoon the two then drove up to
the Gibbett Inn, and Larose, alighting quickly, made his way into
the bar. It was unoccupied except for a surly looking man who was
seated behind the counter, reading a newspaper. The man rose
leisurely when Larose appeared.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cramm, I believe," said Larose, and upon the man nodding
a rather suspicious acquiescence, he presented the letter of
introduction.</p>

<p>"Ah! I thought so," exclaimed the landlord frowningly after a
glance down at the letter. "Another of them, are you?" He
regarded Larose with not very friendly eyes. "Well, we're sick of
it," he went on, "and if it were not for the drinks your people
buy when they come down, I'd not answer another question. Here,
walk this way."</p>

<p>He led Larose round into a passage at the back of the door and
shouted "Cyn, where are you?" whereupon, a shrill voice came from
upstairs. "Here, Dad, do you want me?"</p>

<p>The landlord jerked with his thumb. "Up those stairs," he said
to Larose, "and you'll find her in the sitting-room. You won't
want me," and then, as if detectives of all kinds had become of
no interest to him, he returned unceremoniously into the bar.</p>

<p>Ascending the stairs, Larose found himself in the elf-like
presence of Miss Cynthia Cramm, with the girl for the moment
regarding him as her father had done, with no appearance of
pleasure. But then taking in that her visitor was fashionably
dressed, quite young, and decidedly good-looking, her expression
changed quickly, and she gave him a quiet and reserved smile.</p>

<p>"Another detective, of course!" she exclaimed. "And what do
you want?"</p>

<p>Larose took her measure at once, and made a most respectful
bow. "So sorry to worry you, Miss Cramm," he said with great
deference, "and I won't keep you long." He beamed at her. "No,
I'm not a detective, but my friend, Lord Ransome, expressly asked
me to come and see you."</p>

<p>A most pleasurable feeling thrilled through the angular little
frame of Miss Cynthia Cramm as Larose mentioned the name of the
Cabinet Minister. So Lord Ransome had asked him to see her, and
he was quite different to the others, too! They had treated her
as a child, and called her by her Christian name, but he was now
addressing her as Miss Cramm.</p>

<p>She thawed all at once. "Come in here," she said sweetly, and
she led the way into a small sitting-room containing a piano.
"We'll sit on this sofa," she went on, as cool and collected as
if she were addressing a person of her own age, "and then we can
speak quite quietly, in case any of the maids should try to
'listen-in' at the door."</p>

<p>The smile of Larose was now a perfectly genuine one, and he
had difficulty in not letting it pass into a grin. The girl was
as self-possessed as if she were three or four and twenty,
instead of sixteen, which was the age he now knew her to be.</p>

<p>"Now ask me anything you like," she said graciously when the
door was shut and they had seated themselves upon the sofa. "I am
sure I should like to help Lord Ransome, if I can. I have read
about him, of course. He is the Home Secretary."</p>

<p>Larose was delighted, for with all the airs she was giving
herself, here he perceived was an intelligence that should prove
most useful to him. He came to the point at once.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Cramm," he said, "it seems as if everything is
going to depend upon you, for apart from what you can tell us, we
can learn nothing whatsoever about these men"&mdash;he spoke very
slowly&mdash;"these monsters who are taking life after life and
escaping without being caught."</p>

<p>"Well, I've helped all I can," protested the girl, "and I tell
you I've not had a too pleasant time." She bridled with
indignation. "First, I was treated as a liar, and after that
they've shouted at me as if by their shouting they could make me
remember things that I hadn't seen or heard."</p>

<p>"I know, I know," Larose said soothingly. "Detectives are very
annoying men, but I'm going to be quite different. I don't want
to go over the whole thing again, because I've got a copy here of
everything you told them on a sheet of paper in my pocket," and
he took out and unfolded some closely-written typescript.</p>

<p>He glanced down at the paper and went on, speaking very
slowly. "You say you suddenly woke up and heard the horrible mad
laugh of one of them. Then a lot of names were mentioned but you
remember only two of them, Burkington, because you have a girl
friend of that name, and Clutterbuck, because it has such a funny
sound." He laughed. "And I quite agree with you. Clutterbuck does
sound funny." He went on. "Then it at once came to you that
whoever was in the room, they were not eating, because there were
no familial sounds of the clicking of knives and forks.
Then&mdash;what happened?"</p>

<p>"Then I knew I must have been asleep a long time," replied the
girl, "for I saw that lunch was finished with and over. So I
squirmed my body round until my eyes were opposite a crack in the
ottoman and I saw four pairs of feet and the lower part of four
legs. The crack in the ottoman is not wide and quite low down,
but I could see right across the room and that all the chairs at
the long table were unoccupied." She nodded reminiscently. "I
tell you I was very frightened, for Dad is quick-tempered and I
knew he would thrash me hard for having been away so long."</p>

<p>"But how did you know the meal was over?" asked Larose. "It
mightn't have yet begun."</p>

<p>The girl looked scornful. "If you had ever helped clear up,"
she replied, "after a lot of piggish men and women had been
filling their insides, you'd know right enough from the state of
the floor whether the meal was over or not yet begun." She tilted
up her chin contemptuously. "Serviettes thrown under the table,
crumbs and crusts of bread all scattered about, and even lumps of
half-chewed meat, if they've come upon anything tough." She
smiled. "Besides, I could smell the Stilton cheese and the port
wine those men were drinking."</p>

<p>Larose was highly amused, for this chit of a girl was talking,
as if for all the world her father were giving the meals
away.</p>

<p>"But about the shoes these men were wearing," he said, "that's
what I want to learn." He smiled challengingly. "Now do you know
anything about shoes?"</p>

<p>Again, the girl looked scornful. "If you'd cleaned as many
pairs as I have," she replied, "you'd be able to boast of
something." She looked injured. "Why, before we got on and mum's
cooking brought such a lot of people to the place&mdash;before we
could afford to keep any maids&mdash;I, if you please, cleaned
all the boots and shoes of everyone who was staying here. What
were their shoes like?" She rattled off quickly. "A six, two
nines, and a 10. All of good quality and one of the nines had a
very broad welt. The broad welt belonged to the man who talked
most, and who afterwards paid the bill for them all, the ten was
the man with a horrible laugh, the six spoke very quietly, and
the other nine was gruff and rather rude." She smiled at the look
of surprise upon Larose's face. "They all spoke as if they were
educated men besides being well dressed."</p>

<p>Larose was not only surprised but delighted also. Here, he was
already learning something that had not been put down in the
police reports&mdash;the shoes with the broad welt. A small
thing, certainly, but in the tracking down of crime the smallest
things at times become important and often their cumulative value
is priceless.</p>

<p>"But tell me," he asked quickly, "did you see the soles of any
of these shoes?"</p>

<p>"Of two of them," she replied, "and you could tell they had
been driving their cars, for, when they leant back in their
chairs and rested their feet upon their heels, I saw the polished
spot where they press down the accelerator. Those shoes belonged
to the ten and one of the nines, not the nine with the broad
welt."</p>

<p>"And his shoes," asked Larose quickly, "the broad-welted shoes
of the man who you say talked the most. Did they look like shoes
you would go motoring in?"</p>

<p>"Our customers are practically all motorists," she replied
grandly. "We don't cater for hikers. Our prices are much too
high. We charge 3/6 for lunch."</p>

<p>"Never mind that," said Larose, "for he may have been an
exception. Think"&mdash;he smiled&mdash;"would you be likely to
be driving a car in those shoes, for if they had broad welts they
would be likely, also, to have thick soles and be walking
shoes."</p>

<p>For the first time Miss Cynthia did not seem to be quite so
ready with her reply, and she sat frowning and biting her
underlip very thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"No-o," she said slowly, after a long pause, "I don't think I
should, for they would be rather heavy." Then she added suddenly
and in a very different tone. "No, he might not perhaps have come
in a car, for I remember now there was mud upon his shoes." She
nodded brightly. "Yes, his were the only dirty pair. All the
others looked spick and span as if they had just been put
on."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" exclaimed Larose, "then he may have walked here!
But how do you know," he went on quickly, "if you could only see
the legs of these men, that it was the one with these heavy shoes
who did most of the talking?"</p>

<p>She smiled as if she were amused. "After a few minutes," she
replied, "I could tell instantly which of the four was speaking
by the movements of his feet or the shifting about of the legs of
his chair. They were all talking earnestly, and there was some
movement in their bodies when they spoke. The man with the thick
shoes had a lovely voice, like an educated clergyman or some one
speaking over the air, and when he was talking the front legs of
his chair kept tilting up and down, and you could tell his body
was moving backwards and forwards, or from side to side. You
understand," she explained, "I could see much better than I could
hear, for their voices were always muffled to me except when I
was just raising the lid of the ottoman, and I couldn't keep that
up for long at a time. It made my arm ache so."</p>

<p>"You are very intelligent, Miss Cramm," said Larose warmly,
"and it is a pleasure to talk to you." He laughed. "You would
make a good detective."</p>

<p>The girl laughed too. "But if you only knew the time I've had
during the last few days," she said, "ever since the detectives
began coming up, you would be sorry for me." She looked very
sorry for herself. "I lie awake at night for hours and hours,
trying to recall something else they said." She sighed. "But I
think I've told everything I can remember."</p>

<p>Larose was looking down at a paper in his hand. "Well, there
are one of two questions," he said, "that I want to ask you
about. You told the detectives that one of the men mentioned they
had tools all ready to hand."</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded the girl, "the man with the nice voice said
that."</p>

<p>"And then he went on to say," said Larose still looking at the
paper, "that some one they knew would cut any one's throat with
his razor if only they paid him well enough for it."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the girl, "he said he was sure the man would be
willing to do it, or at any rate, he looked as if he would be
willing to do it. He then said that he had seen this same man
buying filthy black cigarettes one night in a shop in Soho, and
he wouldn't wonder if he hadn't fought against us in the
war."</p>

<p>Larose looked up sharply. "But you didn't mention about those
cigarettes to the detectives," he said with a frown. "It's not
down here on this paper."</p>

<p>"No," she replied calmly. "I didn't think of it until just
now, when those nicotine stains on your fingers reminded me of
it."</p>

<p>Larose repressed a smile. "Black cigarettes, he said he saw
him buy?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Filthy black ones," was the reply. "Those were his exact
words."</p>

<p>"And then one or them said," went on Larose turning back to
his paper, "that the smell of some place they used to go into
made him feel sick every time for a few minutes until he got used
to it."</p>

<p>"Yes, the man with the gruff voice said that," replied the
girl, "the man with the other shoes of size nine."</p>

<p>"And did he say that immediately after the remark had been
made about the man cutting throats with his razor," asked Larose,
"as if there were some connection between the razor man and the
smell?"</p>

<p>"Almost immediately it must have been," said the girl,
"because I remember I was pushing up the top of the ottoman then,
and had to let it down very soon after to give myself a
rest."</p>

<p>"And did any one else say anything about this smell?" was the
next question.</p>

<p>The girl hesitated. "I think it was the man with the horrible
laugh," she replied slowly, "who said something like, 'Oh! that's
nothing to them, for they live on smells where they come from.'"
She nodded emphatically. "Yes, and he said, too, it was a better
smell than that of men and women who never washed or changed
their clothes."</p>

<p>"And then they talked about Hankow!" said Larose.</p>

<p>"They only said that someone they knew about came from there.
I just caught the name of the place."</p>

<p>Larose looked down again upon the paper and remarked
meditatively: "And you saw a diamond ring upon the finger of the
man who paid the bill when he bent down to arrange one of his
socks, and the hand was big and plump and white." He thought for
a moment. "And should you know that man's voice again?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"If I live to be a hundred," exclaimed Cynthia fervently, "for
it was a beautiful voice, and kept going up and down."</p>

<p>"Now, one last question," said Larose, "and think over it
before you reply, because it is very important." He eyed her
solemnly. "Now, did it strike you, from the way they spoke to one
another, that they were old friends&mdash;or that they were
comparative strangers to one another?"</p>

<p>"I can't say," replied the girl slowly. She nodded. "All I can
tell you is that they talked about that throat cutting man and
other people they had been with as if they knew all about
them."</p>

<p>"That's not what I mean," said Larose quickly. "I want to find
out if it seemed to you that that they had had chats together
before. If they had had meals and drinks together and knew each
other's little ways."</p>

<p>The girl thought for a long time. "Perhaps not," she replied,
after a while, "for I remember when the man with the nice voice
asked the one with the small shoes once if he was sure he
wouldn't have one of his cigarettes, the answer was, 'No, thank
you. I tell you I never smoke.'"</p>

<p>"That's it!" nodded Larose. "That's what I wanted to know." He
rose to his feet. "Well, thank you very much, Miss Cramm. I'm
sure you've been most helpful. Now, a last favour. Could I see
this head waitress of yours, although I've been told she can
recollect nothing, and the other two girls are just as
useless?"</p>

<p>"Of course you can," replied Cynthia. "I'll go and fetch her
at once." She rose up from the sofa and walked over towards the
door, but then, in passing the window, she stopped suddenly and
ejaculated, "My!"</p>

<p>Larose followed the direction of her eyes and saw that it was
Croupin, who had now attracted her attention. The Frenchman was
standing by the car below, and with a very disconsolate look upon
his face, smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p>"But isn't he handsome," went on Cynthia ecstatically. "He
looks like a film star." She turned sharply to Larose. "Is he a
friend of yours? Did he come with you?"</p>

<p>"He's my chauffeur," smiled Larose, "and when you've sent that
waitress to me, you can go and talk to him."</p>

<p>"Sure, I will," replied Cynthia archly. "I like talking to
good-looking men."</p>

<p>Larose questioned the waitress, but could get nothing out of
her. She was wooden and unintelligent and could add nothing to
that she had already told the detective, indeed she declared she
would not have recollected the incident of the four men at all,
if it had not been that it had happened upon the afternoon when
the landlord's daughter could not be found anywhere, and was not
at hand to help them tidy up the room.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Larose and Croupin drove off from the
inn, the former in good spirits, but the latter, seemingly rather
depressed.</p>

<p>"Well, Croupin my boy," asked Larose presently, as they were
speeding along towards the south coast, "did you admire the
beauties you saw."</p>

<p>"I saw no beauties," replied Croupin in disconsolate tones.
"Only a very red-faced woman who waddled like a duck, and a child
who came and asked me silly questions."</p>

<p>"She was not a child!" exclaimed Larose, as if very surprised.
"She is getting on for seventeen and is the daughter I came to
see!"</p>

<p>"Bon nuit!" exclaimed Croupin disgustedly, "and I told her to
go back to her dolls." Then he asked abruptly, "And did you get
anything out of her?"</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Larose emphatically, "most certainly I did. I
have several things to talk over with you to-night after I've
seen the judge's widow. We're off to Eastbourne now to catch her
before dinner time."</p>

<p>Lady Lorraine was a frail old lady, well over seventy, and she
received Larose with a gentle old-world courtesy. She did not
mind discussing her husband's dreadful end and was anxious to
give all the help she could. Larose had been up the lane and with
the aid of a photograph he had brought with him, had picked out
the exact spot where the judge had been killed. Now he pressed
her hard as to any trivial happenings in the weeks just prior to
when her husband died.</p>

<p>"We have got as far as this," he said. "We are sure that if
this terrible happening were not the unpremeditated act of a
madman, then it was carefully prepared for and someone waited to
seize the opportunity when your husband would be alone. You have
told us the lane is little used, but that he passed along it
every day, as a matter of routine, for his short morning walk.
You almost invariably accompanied him, but did not do so the
morning upon which he died, because you were in bed with a bad
cold."</p>

<p>The old lady nodded. "Yes, that is so," she replied sadly,
"and it was the first morning for a long time that I had not gone
with him."</p>

<p>"Then you told the inspector," went on Larose, "that you had
never noticed any suspicious strangers hanging about and had no
recollection of meeting the same party twice, but you also said
that the day before everything happened, you both came upon a man
at the bottom of the lane, standing on the tree-trunk there,
looking over your garden wall."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lady Lorraine, "he said he had been admiring our
roses."</p>

<p>"And you only happened to speak to him," continued Larose,
"because your little fox-terrier ran up and began barking at him
and Sir John then called the dog back and apologised."</p>

<p>"That is so," said the old lady, "and the gentleman was most
polite. My husband asked him if he would like to come in and go
through the garden, but he excused himself that he had only just
time to get back to his hotel for lunch."</p>

<p>"And you can't describe him!" said Larose.</p>

<p>"No, I am very short-sighted without my glasses," she replied,
"which I never wear when out-doors, and except that I think he
was of medium height and rather stout, I can tell you nothing
about him." She shook her head most emphatically. "But he would
never have harmed my poor husband. He was a gentleman, whatever
he was."</p>

<p>"And, of course, you realised that from the way he spoke,"
said Larose quietly, "from his voice. Now, tell me what was his
voice like?"</p>

<p>"Very cultured and pleasant," replied Lady Lorraine, "and my
dear husband remarked upon it, too, later on."</p>

<p>"Oh! and what did he say?" asked Larose quickly.</p>

<p>"That it was the voice of an orator," was the answer, "and
recalled to him the days when the great King's Counsels used to
plead before him in the Courts." She smiled wistfully. "You see,
Mr. Smith, living the quiet and uneventful lives that we did, all
by ourselves, most trifling things interested us and that is why
I happen to remember this gentleman speaking to us."</p>

<p>"And perhaps," said Larose very gently and endeavouring to
keep her thoughts in the same channel, "this chance encounter
made Sir John reminiscent, and he spoke about some of the cases
that had been tried before him."</p>

<p>Lady Lorraine smiled. "You are quite a wizard," she said.
"Yes, he did, and we sat over lunch for quite a long time that
day." Tears welled up into her eyes. "I remember that meal so
well, because it was the last one we had together. I went to bed
that afternoon and was there"&mdash;her voice choked&mdash;"when
his body was brought home."</p>

<p>Larose waited until she had entirely recovered from her
emotion and then asked carelessly&mdash;</p>

<p>"And can you recall any of the trials, in particular, that he
mentioned?"</p>

<p>She thought for a moment. "One," she replied, "when some
doctor was being tried for murder and Mortimer Fairfax was
prosecuting. He said it was a battle royal between Mr. Fairfax
and the counsel for the defence, Sir Arnold Trevane, and they
both were so wonderful that he himself could never be quite
certain as to whether the doctor were guilty or not." She nodded.
"However, he was hanged."</p>

<p>That was all Larose could learn from her, and when he left the
house a few minutes later, he carried away with him the
remembrance of a very dear old lady, who was brave enough to be
living out the remainder of her life within a few yards of the
spot where her husband had met with such a dreadful end.</p>

<p>They put up at the Queen's Hotel in Eastbourne, and when after
dinner they retired to their common bedroom, Larose at once began
to talk business.</p>

<p>"Now, Monsieur," he said with a smile, "you may be a great
rogue but at the same time you are a very wise one, and in that
nicely shaped head of yours there is plenty of imagination, and
good reasoning power, or you would not have been wanted so much
by the authorities of your very charming country."</p>

<p>"I am a rogue no longer, Meester Larose," said Croupin with
great dignity, "for I am now your friend, and I know you would
not be consorting with an evil-doer."</p>

<p>"I'm not so certain of that," replied Larose, with a grin,
"for it seems to me I've been consorting with evil-doers all my
life." He took some papers out of his pocket. "Never mind, here
goes. I'm going to ask you for your suggestions and advice."</p>

<p>Then in minute detail he proceeded to go through the
conversations he had had with Cynthia Cramm, and the widowed Lady
Lorraine. "Now, Monsieur Croupin, what do you make of it?" he
asked, when he had finished. "Have I learnt anything to-day that
will be of use to us or not?" He looked doubtful. "You see, I can
imagine so many things that hang upon such slender threads that I
am afraid to let my imagination go."</p>

<p>"But some things are so clear, Meester Larose," said Croupin
earnestly, "that there is no need for imagination. One
thing&mdash;that man who paid for the meal and the wine was, of
course, the host, therefore it was he who had asked those others
to meet him there."</p>

<p>"It looks as if the host of that dinner lives close to the
inn," commented Larose, "and that he walked, for there was mud on
both his shoes, not a chance splash, but mud on the broad welt
between the soles and the uppers." He nodded. "Yes; this man, the
host, the leader of the four, should live within a few miles of
the inn, and he chose it as a place of rendezvous, because it
suited his convenience."</p>

<p>"But if he lives near," argued Croupin, "why didn't he ask
those men to come to his own house? They must have thought it
strange!"</p>

<p>"I take it they didn't know where he lived," replied Larose
quickly, "indeed, probably they were none of them aware where one
another lived. Also, I am of opinion that the man who called them
together was the only one there who knew there was going to be a
party." He scoffed. "If they had all known it, why should they
have gone through the farce of sitting apart from one another at
the meal, knowing that the waitresses were going to see them all
hobnobbing together afterwards?" He added convincingly. "This was
their first meeting, too."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Croupin, "how do you make that out?"</p>

<p>"They met to plot murder and outrage, we know," replied
Larose. "None of the series we are now called upon to deal with
had commenced up to then, but they commenced immediately
afterwards. Also, over that port wine and liqueurs, they were not
too well acquainted with one another." He shook his finger at
Croupin. "Remember, the man who gave the party asked one of them
if he was sure he would not have one of his cigarettes, and the
reply was 'I tell you I don't smoke.'" He nodded. "That 'I tell
you' means the stout man had asked him once before, and therefore
had not fully taken in his tastes and habits."</p>

<p>"Bien, Monsieur," said Croupin with a smile, "they are little
things, but the little things count"&mdash;he drew himself up
proudly&mdash;"with men who are tracking murderers down."</p>

<p>"Well, now," went on Larose, "he spoke about 'tools ready to
hand,' and then went on immediately to talk about some man who
looked as if he would cut any one's throat with his razor." He
looked sharply at Croupin. "Now, when you talk about a man and
his razor, obviously, who are they thinking of?"</p>

<p>"A barber," replied Croupin, "and as he went on to say he had
met the fellow one night in Soho buying black cigarettes, the
barber is probably not an Englishman. Also as he said that
perhaps the man had fought against England in the war, then this
barber should be a Swiss and not either a Frenchman or a German,
for in either of those cases the stout man would have been
certain whom the barber had been fighting against, and would not
have used the word 'perhaps.'" He laughed gaily. "Perhaps I am
stealing your thunder, Meester Larose, but I am of opinion we
must look for a Swiss barber here."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" laughed back Larose, "we are now giving our
imagination full play, but for all that we may be quite
right."</p>

<p>"And there is, of course, a Chinaman mixed up in it as well,"
went on Croupin. "The gentleman from Hankow."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Larose, "and now we come to the smell." He spoke
very thoughtfully. "What did it mean, when immediately after
talking about the barber the gruff man said that the smell of
somewhere they used to go into always made him feel sick for a
few minutes, until he had got accustomed to it?"</p>

<p>"They had been accustomed to meet in some place where there
were chemicals," replied Croupin promptly, "or tallow, or
hides"&mdash;his eyes sparkled&mdash;"in some warehouse perhaps,
down by the docks in the East End."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Larose, "and that's where most of the
Chinamen are. Didn't the man with the unpleasant voice say 'they
live on smells where they come from.'" He smiled. "Yes, our
imaginations are not failing us."</p>

<p>A short silence followed and then he went on. "And now we come
to something that may eventually prove to be the strongest link
in the chain we are going to forge about these men." He spoke
impressively. "I have been to two houses to-day, and in both of
them mention has been made of a voice, and taking all the
circumstances together there is no doubt in my mind that I have
been hearing about one and the same voice, the voice of the stout
man in the Gibbett Inn and the voice of the stroller in the lane,
who one morning spoke so charmingly to Sir John Lorraine, and the
next day bludgeoned him to death almost at the same spot."</p>

<p>He leant back in his chair. "You see, Monsieur," he went on,
"that voice made a great impression upon little Cynthia Cramm,
and in a lesser degree interested Lady Lorraine. The girl
described it as the voice of a fine preacher, or some one chosen
to broadcast over the air, and the judge's widow referred to it
as stamping its possessor as a gentleman. Also, it had a singular
effect upon Sir John himself, for it made him reminiscent and
stirred in him memories of great legal battles of long ago." He
nodded very solemnly. "Now, my opinion is that the old judge
subconsciously recognised the voice, that he had heard it before,
and that is why it carried him back in memory to the environment
where he had once encountered it."</p>

<p>"It may be," admitted Croupin slowly, "for memory can play us
strange tricks. What we remember and why we remember depends upon
such trifles some times." He sighed, "A violet, for instance,
always recalls to me a girl in Picardy I once plighted my troth
to. I can recall her face vividly, whenever I smell one, and yet,
for the life of me, I can never remember her name. She was
exquisite and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You see," broke in Larose, cutting him short, "the voice
roused in two people the same parallel lines of thought: in
Cynthia Cramm a melodious preacher in the pulpit, and in the
judge, a great pleader arguing before him in the court.
Therefore&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But how can the voice help you?" interrupted Croupin in his
turn, annoyed perhaps that the recital of his romance in Picardy
had been shut down. "You can't pick out a voice from among the
fifty millions of others in England, and even if you could you
can't use a voice as evidence in a court of law."</p>

<p>Larose began unloosening his tie. "Well, you see if I can't,
my friend," he smiled. "I've got a good idea there." He took off
his collar. "But it's shut-eye time for us both now, and you can
start straight away to dream of that girl in Picardy you were
speaking about. To-morrow we're off to Surbiton to guess why that
old clergyman died," and he started taking off his clothes,
humming to Croupin's amused annoyance, "Somewhere a voice is
calling!"</p>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br>

GHOSTS OF THE DEAD.</h2>

<p class="first">MRS. FOX-DRUMMOND was a well-known society
woman, and resided in Surbiton in a spacious mansion standing in
its own grounds. A widow about 50 years of age and well-to-do,
she entertained a good deal, and, with no children of her own,
acted as fairy-godmother to a large number of nephews and nieces
whose parents were not so liberally endowed with this world's
goods as she was.</p>

<p>A strong character and of literary tastes, she had written
several novels which, if they had not had a large circulation,
had nevertheless been favourably received by the Press. She was
also interested in art and possessed a number of paintings of
considerable value, a very fine collection of old china, and a
harpsichord of the beginning of the 18th century. She came of a
very old family, and, immensely proud of her own aristocratic
connections, had a profound reverence for the upper classes.</p>

<p>She had known Lady Helen Ardane before the latter's marriage
to Gilbert Larose, and, as a matter of principle, had heartily
disapproved of the match, so when upon that Saturday morning the
ex-detective's card was brought in upon a silver salver by a very
obsequious butler she elevated her eyebrows rather disdainfully,
and when a few moments later Larose himself was ushered in her
manner was distinctly cold and distant.</p>

<p>But the respectful and almost deferential attitude of her
visitor speedily disarmed her, and noticing with approval that he
looked in every way a gentleman and was, moreover, dressed in
perfectly good taste, she became friendly, and was soon disposed
to talk to him without reserve.</p>

<p>"So you've returned to Scotland Yard!" she said. "I thought
you had naturally given all that work up for good."</p>

<p>"No, I haven't returned to the Yard," replied Larose, "but as
all these dreadful crimes are so baffling to every one and now
appear to be a sequence, I was asked by the Home Office to see if
I could help in any way." He smiled apologetically. "I am so very
sorry to bother you, but it is just possible coming fresh into
the inquiry I may pick up something that the others missed."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it you want me to tell you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I want you to just go over for me exactly what happened that
afternoon," he replied, "immediately before it was discovered the
poor archdeacon had met with such a terrible death. He was your
cousin, I understand, and you were giving a little party to
celebrate the 21st birthday of his daughter, Miss Angela Lendon.
You had lunched together and then the young people had played
tennis until about half-past five. Then all of you except the
archdeacon had come indoors to have a cocktail. You left him
seated in a garden chair over upon the other side of the lawn,
but in full view of all the windows of the house. He was
reading."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "and we could see him from the room where we
were. He was leaning back with his feet upon another chair, and
his legs were wrapped in a rug." She shuddered. "He might have
been shot any moment after we left him, for except that the book
had dropped from his hands and one arm was hanging down, his
position when we found him was almost exactly as it had been
before." She steadied her voice with an effort. "It was only his
head that had moved, and that was leaning sideways as if he had
fallen asleep."</p>

<p>She rose abruptly to her feet, and beckoned Larose to follow
her to the window. "Look, that's where he was sitting," she went
on, "just under that tree and that"&mdash;she pointed to a high
backed and well-cushioned cane chair&mdash;"is the facsimile of
the chair he was sitting in." She drew in a deep breath. "The
other one has been burnt."</p>

<p>"And none of you has any recollection," asked Larose gently,
"of hearing any noise like a rifle being fired?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "None of us. We were laughing and talking,
and with the wireless on there was small chance of hearing a
little .22 being fired." She looked quickly at him. "You know of
course, that it was a .22 rifle that was used?" She sighed. "I
fired with one for many years, when a girl in Devonshire, and
remember well what a little noise it makes. Just a snap, or like
the crack of a whip." Her face looked furious. "The murderer
couldn't have been a dozen yards away when he fired"&mdash;she
pointed with her finger&mdash;"and there isn't a shadow of doubt
he fired over that wall."</p>

<p>"And, of course, you all thought it was an accident at first!"
said Larose.</p>

<p>"I didn't," she replied sharply. "I knew it was murder at
once, because I saw the two bullet holes, the instant I looked at
him." She nodded. "The murderer was taking no chances, and
deliberately fired twice."</p>

<p>Larose was silent for a few moments to allow Mrs. Fox-Drummond
to calm down, and then he asked quietly. "And none of you can
form any idea as to why anybody should have wished to take your
cousin's life?"</p>

<p>"If it were not for these other murders," she replied, "I
should say at once it was because of his book, 'Facing Facts.' He
was a very broad churchman and his views had made him a lot of
enemies. He was always receiving letters demanding that he should
unfrock himself and leave the Church." She scoffed
contemptuously. "He threw them all into the fire."</p>

<p>They talked on for quite a long time, and then Larose, getting
up to take his leave, she rose up, too, and moved towards the
door with the evident intention of herself showing him out.</p>

<p>"Your wife is a very sweet woman, Mr. Larose," she said,
smilingly and evidently relieved now to change the conversation.
"I met her as Lady Ardane several times, and from that photograph
in 'The Sphere' a little while back, she hasn't altered at all.
Just as beautiful and stately as ever!" Her face clouded
suddenly, and she bit her lip. "Ah! that reminds me. I'll show
you a photograph that was taken of us all that afternoon, not
half an hour before my poor cousin died. I had a photographer
down from town, expressly, to make a good picture. Come with me
and I'll show it you."</p>

<p>She led the way into a small room off the lounge hall, and
pointed out a large photograph, about two feet by one, hanging
upon the wall. It was a fine piece of work, and the faces and
figures of every one of the score and more individuals stood out
most clearly and distinctly.</p>

<p>"That is my cousin, of course," she said quietly, "and you can
see what a fine, strong face he had." Her voice trembled. "He was
quite a young man, although he was 63."</p>

<p>A deep hush came over them, for they were both thinking of the
mystery and uncertainty of life. Here was a group of happy
smiling people, dainty girls, stately matrons, and distinguished-looking men, all seemingly in the full participation of the good
things of life, and yet&mdash;had they only known it&mdash;they
were all standing in the very shadow of death, and within a few
short moments one of their number was to come to a foul and
bloody end.</p>

<p>But suddenly Larose drew in a sharp inspiration and with
difficulty suppressed an exclamation of surprise. He said
nothing, however, for a few moments, and then pointing to one of
the figures in the group asked carelessly, "And who is that
gentleman holding the racquet?"</p>

<p>"Another cousin of mine," replied Mrs. Fox-Drummond, "Mr.
Mortimer Fairfax, the King's Counsel. He and Archdeacon Lendon
were half-brothers."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" exclaimed Larose, now unable to repress his
surprise, "why, what a coincidence, for I was only talking about
him yesterday, and he is a gentleman I very much want to see!
Where does he live, please?"</p>

<p>"At Ingatestone," she replied, "the other side of London, in
Essex."</p>

<p>Larose looked quickly at his watch. "Then do you think I
should catch him at home this afternoon?" he asked. "It's very
important. I suppose he's on the 'phone."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fox-Drummond shook her head. "No, he won't be at home
this afternoon," she replied. She laughed, "He's coming here for
some tennis after lunch."</p>

<p>Larose looked the picture of astonishment. "Well!" he
exclaimed, "what another coincidence! It's almost unbelievable!"
He spoke very regretfully. "Now, I wonder if I might call back
here this afternoon, for just a few minutes, and have a little
chat with him. Yes, the matter's really very urgent, or I
wouldn't bother you. May I come back?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Fox-Drummond hesitated just a moment, "No, you mustn't
come back, Mr. Larose," she said, inclining her head graciously.
"You must stay to lunch with us. I shall be so pleased, and you
can tell me about some of your adventures. There will be only
Miss Lendon with me. She is my goddaughter."</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you, I'm sure," said Larose warmly, "but I
have a friend with me, who brought me down in his car"&mdash;he
rolled out the name in secret amusement&mdash;"Monsieur de
Choisy-Hautville."</p>

<p>"Then, of course, he'll stay, too," said Mrs. Fox-Drummond
instantly. "I'll ring for the butler to ask him to come in."</p>

<p>"No, no," exclaimed Larose, pointing to the open French
window, and anxious that at all costs no one should see Croupin
in his chauffeur's cap. "I'll go and fetch him if I may. He's
only just outside."</p>

<p>He found Croupin sitting in the car, and the Frenchman at once
discarded his cap and dust-coat when he heard what was going to
happen, and almost in a movement like that of a conjuror,
produced and put on his big emerald ring.</p>

<p>"Now don't be too friendly," admonished Larose, "for she's
inclined to be high-and-mighty, and a bit stand-offish with it as
well."</p>

<p>But he was quite wrong there, for Mrs. Fox-Drummond received
the Frenchman in a mostly friendly fashion, and at once held out
her hand. "I've heard of your family, Monsieur," she said. "The
de Choisy-Hautvilles come from Brittany, do they not?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," replied Croupin very delighted. "My estate is near
Rennes."</p>

<p>Angela Lendon came in presently, and the moment he set eyes
upon her Croupin's heart beat so violently that he was sure he
would be unable to taste a single morsel of the lunch.</p>

<p>The girl was dainty and aristocratic-looking, with golden
hair, nice complexion, and eyes of beautiful forget-me-not
colour. She carried herself proudly, but if her expression were a
little cold, it was redeemed by the hint of passion in the lips
of her very pretty mouth. She was of medium height, with a
graceful and well-proportioned figure.</p>

<p>The luncheon party certainly proved a great success, but it
was undoubtedly Croupin who carried off all the honours. His
manners were so charming, he was so deferential towards the
ladies and yet with all he carried himself with such due pride,
as became a descendant of the French nobility. His knowledge too,
of the subjects that most interested his hostess and Miss Lendon
were so profound that they could not help being thrilled.</p>

<p>He could name all the private owners of the most valuable
paintings in France, all the great ladies there who possessed the
most priceless jewels, and the precautions they took to prevent
them being stolen, and all the castles and great chateaux where
the historic tapestries were housed.</p>

<p>Then when they spoke of music his dark eyes flashed as he told
them how he had played upon some of the great master-works of the
old Cremona school, and how he had himself once possessed a
genuine Antonio Stradivaris. Altogether, he was so interesting
that it was easy to perceive from the heightened colour of the
young girl what pleasure she was deriving from his conversation.
Indeed after the meal was over she commandeered him openly to go
with her and try his skill upon the old historic harpsichord.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Larose," said Mrs. Fox-Drummond, when they were
together by themselves, "there are six or seven people coming for
the tennis this afternoon, and some of them may be here any
moment, now. So, I suggest, as you say you do not wish it to be
broadcast that you are speaking privately to Mr. Fairfax, that
you wait here for him and I'll send him into you directly he
comes."</p>

<p>"That's very thoughtful of you," agreed Larose, "and I shall
be most grateful." He thought for a moment. "But if you don't
mind I should like to wait in the little room where the
photograph was. I want to study it again."</p>

<p>And so it happened that about half an hour later a big burly
man, with a large face of ruddy complexion, bustled into the room
where Larose was, and eyed the ex-detective very keenly from
under his shaggy brows.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon," he said gruffly as he came forward to shake
hands, "I know all about you, of course, and heard you give
evidence once in the Texworthy murder case,"&mdash;he frowned as
if he were not too pleased&mdash;"but what the deuce you want
with me now, I don't understand. To my thinking, they've found
out all they will find out about the trouble here, and I'm quite
sure I can't help you in any way."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," replied Larose, "I expect you to help me
quite a lot." He lowered his voice impressively. "Do you know,
Mr. Fairfax, in my opinion you are in very great danger, and
indeed, are under sentence of death."</p>

<p>"Under sentence of death!" gasped the King's Counsel, as if he
could not believe his ears. He looked furious. "What the devil do
you mean?"</p>

<p>"When they killed the archdeacon on the lawn here," replied
Larose solemnly, "they thought they were killing you. You are not
unlike him in appearance, and see"&mdash;he pointed to the
photograph&mdash;"the shapes of your two heads are exactly
similar." He went on quickly. "The archdeacon was sitting in that
high-backed chair, only his head was visible, and as he was fired
upon from behind, whoever killed him only saw the back of it." He
nodded. "Remember, you, in your calling, are far more likely to
have excited hatred in the heart of someone than an elderly
clergyman, however broad his views." He nodded again. "Yes, in my
opinion, they thought they had got you that afternoon, and it
came into my mind, the very moment I saw that photograph."</p>

<p>The ruddy face of the King's Counsel had paled under its tan.
"Good God!" he exclaimed, "and last Sunday at my place in
Ingatestone, my Pomeranian was growling all night, and in the
morning we found footprints of someone in the bed of phlox, just
under my bedroom window!"</p>

<p>"Do you go home then to Ingatestone every night?" asked
Larose.</p>

<p>"No," replied Fairfax, with his breath still coming unevenly,
"I stay in apartments in the Empire Residential Hotel during the
week, and go home only at week-ends. I am a bachelor."</p>

<p>"Have you been at home every weekend then, since the
archdeacon died?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"No, last Sunday was the first night, for two months. I've
been away on holiday in the Engadine since July." His colour
began to come back, and he spoke angrily. "But, damn it all, man,
whose enmity have I incurred that they should want to murder
me?"</p>

<p>"That's what we've got to find out," replied Larose, "and with
your help, I think we shall do it. See here, Mr. Fairfax, I have
what is quite a simple problem to put to you, and to recall some
one who may be your deadly enemy is not nearly so difficult as it
may appear, for"&mdash;he spoke now very slowly&mdash;"the
individual was the enemy also of Sir John Lorraine."</p>

<p>"Ah! I understand," exclaimed the K.C. with a scowl, "you mean
some one I obtained a conviction against, and whom Sir John
sentenced upon the verdict of guilty being brought in?"</p>

<p>"That's it," replied Larose. "Now you've often pleaded before
him, haven't you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Fairfax nodded. "In the last twenty years, I must have led
for the Crown a hundred times when he was presiding over the
Court. I took silk more than five and twenty years ago." He shook
his head frowningly. "But damnation, sir, how can we trail every
man who's got his deserts between us?"</p>

<p>Then Larose, omitting all reference to the Gibbett Inn, told
of his interview with Lady Lorraine the previous night. How, the
day previous to her husband's murder, she and Sir John had met a
pleasant-tongued stranger in the lane just outside the garden
wall; how the judge had remarked later upon the strangers voice,
and how it had stirred in him a whole train of memories of his
days in the Criminal Courts.</p>

<p>"And he particularly brought up your name," concluded Larose,
"so I insist the man's voice made him think of you, and
subconsciously he was remembering some occasion&mdash;not the
exact one he mentioned, because the man found guilty there was
hanged&mdash;where you and he had been principals in some great
drama staged in his court."</p>

<p>"That doesn't help us much," growled the K.C. "My life's been
a very crowded one, and even if I go through every page of my
case-book, I couldn't hope to pick out the man you want."</p>

<p>Then Larose played his trump card. "But think," he said
sternly, "I want a man, probably not too old, who was well,
perhaps even foppishly dressed; who was educated and, no doubt,
plausible; who was certainly of an energetic nature, and prepared
to take risks; who was an organiser; who was a leader of men; a
man of imagination who painted upon a big canvas and did things
in a big way;"&mdash;he spoke very solemnly&mdash;"and, above
all, a man who was an orator and whose voice, may be, thrilled
the Court every time he spoke."</p>

<p>The burly K.C. stood as if hypnotised, with his mouth wide
open and his eyes fixed. In great distress of mind he was
stirring the wells of memory, and he found their waters very
dark.</p>

<p>"Think, think," insisted Larose. "An educated, well-spoken
man, a man of great energy and an orator, with an organ
voice."</p>

<p>The K.C. sprang suddenly into life. "Gad! gad! I know him," he
almost shouted. "I can pick him up. It was Oscar Bascoigne and I
can hear him now. He was in the dock for fraudulent company
promoting, and he had ruined thousands of people. He conducted
his own defence, and although his fraud was absolutely patent,
yet he so swung the jury by his eloquence that it was touch and
go to the last minute whether he got off or not. But they brought
in 'guilty,' and Sir John sent him down for seven years. When the
sentence was pronounced he raved that Sir John's summing-up was
the most scandalous piece of special pleading that had ever been
heard." He drew in a deep breath. "Yes, it's Oscar Bascoigne, you
mean, for sure."</p>

<p>Larose wiped the perspiration from his forehead. "What was he
like?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Everything you say he was," replied Fairfax promptly. "A
clever, plausible rogue. A silver-tongued scoundrel who was
afraid of nothing." He laughed through his teeth. "Ay! he painted
upon a broad canvas right enough. He'd been living like a nabob,
and spending hundreds of thousands of the savings of the little
rich and the thrifty poor."</p>

<p>They talked on for a long while, with Larose now taking him
into his confidence as to all that he had learnt at the Gibbett
Inn. Then the great King's Counsel shook Larose warmly by the
hand.</p>

<p>"You are a real artist, sir," he said smilingly, "and if it
turns out that you are right you will indeed have reaped your
harvest from the desert sands. It's perfectly wonderful to me how
you have deduced so much with so little to go upon."</p>

<p>"Well, don't you go for any more week-ends at Ingatestone,"
warned Larose&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"at any rate, until I am
free to go with you. Then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Damn it all!" laughed the K.C. "I see what's in your mind.
You want to use me as ground bait, don't you."</p>

<p>Larose laughed back. "Something like that, sir," he replied,
"but I promise you they shan't get you if I'm there."</p>

<p>Dragging Croupin away, who came, however, with the greatest of
reluctance, the car was soon turned towards London, for Larose
was now of opinion that he had gathered quite sufficient
information to make a good start, and had best continue his
investigations on the morrow in the vicinity of the Gibbett
Inn.</p>

<p>Croupin was strangely silent as they drove along, and not a
word was spoken for several miles. Then Larose asked with a
smile. "Had a good time, Monsieur? Did you enjoy yourself?"</p>

<p>The Frenchman sighed heavily. "Not too much, Meester Larose,"
he replied, "for there was a ghost behind me all the time."</p>

<p>"A ghost!" exclaimed Larose, very surprised. "But I should
have thought you would have been supremely happy, for you took
that girl's heart by storm, I could see," and as Croupin made no
comment, he asked. "Wouldn't she talk to you when you went off
together?"</p>

<p>Croupin's face brightened at once. "Oh! yes, and she didn't go
out for any tennis," he replied, "until Mrs. Fox-Drummond came in
with some of the others, and we had to go." He smiled sadly. "I
had been playing on that harpsichord for her 'Love's Old Sweet
Song' and other pieces like it"&mdash;he sighed again&mdash;"and
she just sat and watched me."</p>

<p>"Well, why are you unhappy," asked Larose, "and what about the
ghost?"</p>

<p>Croupin sighed for the third time. "It is my past," he
replied. "I can never be a good man, Monsieur, for I have been
once a thief."</p>

<p>"Oh! that's nothing," replied Larose with a grin. "Don't you
come from the old nobility and didn't they bludgeon and thieve
their way into all they got." He laughed banteringly. "You read
history, my boy, and see how the old robber barons carried
on&mdash;the jokers who made the greatness of both your country
and this one." He dug Croupin in the ribs. "It's in your blood,
Monsieur, and you couldn't help it until you'd worked it out."
Then feeling quite sorry for the woe-begone expression upon the
Frenchman's face he added, "it was only adventure you wanted.
Why, I remember I used to steal once, myself."</p>

<p>"You, Meester Larose!" exclaimed Croupin incredulously. "You
were a thief, too?"</p>

<p>Larose looked very solemn. "Apples!" he mouthed in a whisper.
"Apples, grapes, and plums!" He laughed again. "Yes, you'll
settle down one day all right, and if you marry a girl like
Angela Lendon and there are soon six or seven little de Croisy-Hautvilles knocking about, you'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't please, Monsieur," broke in Croupin quickly. "Such
things are too sacred to talk about. It hurts me. I must forget
about her."</p>

<p>But Croupin would have been very interested if he could have
been the fly upon the wall when Mrs. Fox-Drummond and Angela were
discussing him after all the tennis-party had gone, at least it
was the elder lady who discussed him, for the girl herself made
no comment.</p>

<p>"Blood always tells, darling," she said, "and you could see at
once from what stock he has sprung. I admit I was charmed with
him." She nodded impressively. "And he must mix with the very
best in France, to be able to tell us of all those jewels they've
got, and the precautions they take to prevent them being stolen.
Yes, I think him a charming man."</p>

<p>But the girl was still silent, contenting herself with
meditatively opening and shutting her small, white hands. She had
noticed Croupin looking at them when she had handed him her
cigarette case, and she was wondering if he had thought they were
pretty.</p>

<p>Dropping Croupin at his hotel, Larose walked round to Scotland
Yard, and was soon in possession of all the facts concerning one,
Oscar Bascoigne, who fifteen and a half years previously had been
sentenced to seven years' penal servitude, and who, when about
five years later had been released upon ticket-of-leave, had
failed to report himself, even upon one single occasion, to the
authorities.</p>

<p>Bascoigne was 33 years of age at the time of his conviction,
and the son of a medical missionary, and born at Yokohama, had
been sent to England to be educated. From Winchester College he
had gone on to Cambridge, and there had taken a degree with
first-class honours. Then for a short time he had been tutor to
the sons of a wealthy planter in Ceylon, but the climate not
suiting him he had returned to England and entered a stock-broker's office in London. He had speedily shown a genius for
finance, and before he was thirty had started company
promoting.</p>

<p>At first he had met with success after success, but with no
bounds to his ambition his last venture had been the formation of
the Cosmopolitan Investment Company with a capital of
&pound;2,000,000. There, however, everything had gone against
him, and he had soon resorted to devious ways to support the
undertaking, which, indeed, had been a failure from the very
first.</p>

<p>He had been arrested upon a charge of fraud, and, arraigned
before Sir John Lorraine, after a trial lasting eleven days, had
been found guilty and sentenced to seven years' penal servitude.
He had been sent to the convict prison on Dartmoor, and there his
conduct had been of a most exemplary character, and earning full
marks he had been released upon ticket-of-leave a little before
two years the expiration of the sentence.</p>

<p>That was all there was to learn, but for a long while Larose
intently studied the photographs of the ex-convict, trying hard
to weigh up what would now be the exact appearance of the man he
must look for.</p>

<p>Bascoigne was quite prepossessing and good-looking at the time
of his conviction, and of medium height and build he had a face
suggesting great determination and force of character. His eyes
were large and fearless, and there had been a scornful and
contemptuous expression in them as he had stood before the
camera.</p>

<p>"But that mouth is sensual," thought Larose, "and unless he's
had plenty of hard work he'll have run to fat in all these years.
I don't forget that girl said he had a plump white hand."</p>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.<br>

LAROSE HEARS THE VOICE.</h2>

<p class="first">THE ex-detective had offered no explanation at
the Yard as to why he was so interested in Bascoigne, but he
obtained the loan of one of the photographs, and the next
morning, provided with a letter of introduction from the Home
Office, enjoining all and sundry of His Majesty's subjects to
provide one, Thomas Smith, with all the assistance they could
furnish, and accompanied by Croupin in the latter's beautiful
single-seater Bentley, he took the road for Sussex once
again.</p>

<p>Croupin was in a pensive mood, and seemed disinclined to take
much interest in the object of their journey.</p>

<p>"Thinking of Angela, eh?" asked Larose as the car swung
through Croydon and they narrowly escaped colliding with a tram.
"Well, you pay more attention to your driving, please, for I
don't want to be measured for my wooden overcoat before I've had
my patents of nobility." He spoke more sternly. "Buck up, my
friend, and make your atonement by catching these wretches we are
after." He laughed slily. "Do you know, Monsieur, that in a
couple of days or so, I've got a very dangerous job for you."</p>

<p>"Dangerous!" exclaimed Croupin, his face brightening at once.
"Bien, it's love or war always with me, and if there's
danger"&mdash;he sighed heavily&mdash;"I may perhaps be able to
forget my other troubles."</p>

<p>"Oh! There'll be danger, right enough," said Larose, "and
discomfort, too, for you're going to strip off all those fine
clothes and go into the East End to help rout out that throat-cutting barber for me. You'll go as a stoney-broke, my
friend."</p>

<p>"I'm quite willing," smiled Croupin, "for I expected a rough
house when I joined with you." He speeded up the car. "But what's
the business to day?"</p>

<p>"I'm after the voice," replied Larose, "and our first call
will be at the post office in East Grinstead. I've mapped it all
out and I'm thinking we'll get that voice somehow through some
telephone exchange. Listening to voices is the life's work of the
girls there, and I reckon some intelligent young woman will soon
be putting me upon the trail. I'm not banking too much upon the
photo, because in fifteen years he may have altered a lot."</p>

<p>"I'm more convinced than ever that the man must live somewhere
in the neighbourhood of the Gibbett Inn, for otherwise he would
never have picked upon such an outlandish spot to meet his co-conspirators in. So taking the inn as the centre of the triangle,
we're going to try East Grinstead first, then Crowborough, and if
we meet with no success, Tunbridge Wells."</p>

<p>They pulled up at the post office in East Grinstead, and
Larose was soon in earnest conversation with the postmaster.</p>

<p>"Of course, I'm on a very secret mission," he warned that
individual, "and not a word must get out that I am making
inquiries. I have approached you first, because naturally every
one who lives about here will have come to the post office sooner
or later, and you must, in consequence, have some knowledge of
everybody. Now, I want a man, 49 years of age, a gentleman in
appearance and the way in which he lives, well-to-do, of medium
height, may be rather stout in build, of a biggish face and big
eyes, and with white, plump hands. He will be very pleasant to
talk with, very polite, and, above all, he will have a very nice
voice. A voice that will make you think at once of an actor or a
public speaker. Oh! one thing more, he most certainly lives on
the Ashdown Forest side of here." He regarded the postmaster very
intently. "Now, can you pick him out?"</p>

<p>The postmaster looked very doubtful. "You've set me a hard
task," he said slowly, "for we've got a lot of good-class people
about here." He thought for a long time. "He must be 49?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Larose, "that's his age, but of course he may
look older or younger. This is his photo, taken a little over
fifteen years ago. Can you recognise it?"</p>

<p>The postmaster shook his head. "No, I know no one like that
here," he replied, "and I know no one either who answers to your
description."</p>

<p>"Well," said Larose, "we want to take as few people as
possible into our confidence. Now please let me have a word with
the supervisor over the telephone girls."</p>

<p>But the supervisor yielded no better result. She knew plenty
of people with nice voices, but none of whom exactly fitted in
with what the detective wanted. She knew no one like the
photo.</p>

<p>"Try Forest Row," said the postmaster; "that's nearer the
forest, and the postmistress there is very discreet."</p>

<p>But Larose drew blank at Forest Row, and midday found him at
Crowborough. There, to his disappointment, he learnt that the
official in charge had but recently taken up his duties, and
could not help in any way, but upon being introduced to the chief
supervisor, his hopes at once went soaring high, for that young
lady, upon heaving what he wanted, and being shown the
photograph, instead of shaking her head as everybody else had
done, nodded smilingly.</p>

<p>"I know some one," she said, "a very little bit like that, but
the gentleman I mean is not nearly as old as fifty." She nodded
again. "Yes, he's got a beautiful voice, and is a very nice
gentleman. He is always most kind to us telephone girls. He often
sends cases of fruit to the exchange, and every Christmas we get
lovely boxes of chocolates." She looked guardedly at Larose. "But
what do you want to know about him for?"</p>

<p>Larose laughed good-naturedly. "Just to check him up, young
lady," he replied. He shrugged his shoulders. "It's the usual
red-tape Government business, I expect, and may mean nothing at
all." His eyes glinted and his voice became very stern. "But
it'll be as much as my place and yours are worth, if he gets the
very slightest inkling that any one is inquiring about him." He
nodded. "And we shall know at once, for he'll instantly
complain." His pleasant smile came back. "Well, who is the
gentleman?"</p>

<p>"He's Mr. Sheldon-Brown," replied the girl, quite reassured by
Larose's smile, "and he lives at The Pines, by Jervis Brook,
about a mile from the town."</p>

<p>"But what is he?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Oh! he does nothing," she replied. "He's one of the country
gentry and a Justice of the Peace here. He has a lovely garden
and several of us girls have been up to see his flowers." She
became enthusiastic. "He's such a kind man, and does a lot for
the town."</p>

<p>"What sort of house has he got," asked Larose, "a big
one?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Not a very big one," she replied, "but
just nice-sized for a bachelor. He keeps a butler and his wife,
who is the cook, a house parlour-maid and a gardener, who also
attends to his car. He must be very well off." She looked amused.
"But you can see him yourself this afternoon, if you want to, for
he's sure to be at the Chrysanthemum Show here. His great hobby
is flowers."</p>

<p>And so it came about that that afternoon, the very delighted
Cynthia Cramm was being escorted by Larose and Croupin to the
Chrysanthemum Show at the Crowborough Town Hall. She was attired
in her best frock, and knowing exactly what was wanted of her,
was thrilled with the thought of the part she was to play. She
was going to be tried out, she had been told, to see if she could
recognise any of the voices she had heard that Sunday at the inn,
and if she did so, she was on no account to start, or show any
surprise, but was to just touch Larose upon the arm.</p>

<p>They were at the show before many other people had arrived,
and made the round of the exhibits in comfort. Larose asked no
questions of any one, but noting some very beautiful blooms with
the ticket above them, 'Open class. First Prize. Sheldon-Brown
Esq. (gardener, William Harper),' he presently took his station
not far away and with the radiant little Cynthia nestling close
up to him, waited for events to happen.</p>

<p>The hall was by now well crowded, but he had not been waiting
very long, before he heard a rich, deep voice behind him. "Good
afternoon, Vicar. Some very fine chrysanthemums here," and he
felt Cynthia tremble suddenly, and then she convulsively clutched
him by the arm.</p>

<p>He made no movement to turn his head, but returning the
squeeze of his small companion, after a few moments, sidled back
so that the speaker with the rich voice was in full view, and his
heart beat very quickly as he regarded him with apparent idle
carelessness.</p>

<p>Then his first feeling was one of keen disappointment, for the
man looked very different from the photograph of Oscar Bascoigne,
taken fifteen and a half years ago. He was of very much heavier
build, squarer in the shoulders, and his face was jovial and
hearty-looking, with nothing of the appearance of a furtive and
half-crazy conspirator about him.</p>

<p>But then the object of his regard turned his head sideways,
and for one fleeting second his eyes rested upon Larose and for
perhaps a little longer upon the girl at his side, and in those
fleeting seconds all the ex-detective's doubts were
unhesitatingly swept away.</p>

<p>The eyes were quite unmistakably the same big, fearless eyes
with which Oscar Bascoigne had faced the camera with such
unbroken spirit, when his feet had first been set upon the way of
seven years of penal servitude with hard labour.</p>

<p>A thrill of exultation surged through Larose, and it was with
a great effort only that he managed to appear unconcerned. Then,
fearful that Cynthia Cramm should become possessed of too much of
the secret, by learning who the silver-tongued stranger was, he
pulled her gently away and led her quickly out of the hall.</p>

<p>"That was the man!" she exclaimed excitedly. "I'm sure it
was."</p>

<p>"But it can't be," said Larose carelessly and as if he were
not much interested, "for we know all about the gentleman and
he's quite all right." He looked very solemn. "So you mustn't say
even to your parents that you are sure you recognised his voice,
for if you do, it'll be getting us all into trouble."</p>

<p>The girl looked very crestfallen. "Then I haven't been of any
use to you," she said ruefully.</p>

<p>"But, indeed, you have," replied Larose quickly, "and through
you we shall certainly get them in the end." He smiled brightly
at her. "Now I've got a little surprise for you, and I'm sure you
will be delighted. Lord Ransome wants to make you a present, and
so my nice-looking friend here is going to take you to the best
jeweller in Crowborough and buy you a pretty wrist-watch before
he drives you back home."</p>

<p>He bustled the excited girl into the car and then pulling
Croupin aside, whispered quickly. "Don't spend more than three or
four pounds on the watch or it will make the girl look
conspicuous. Then drive her home quickly and come back here and
wait for me at the Crown Hotel." He lowered one eye-lid
stealthily. "Yes, we've made a bulls-eye all right. It was the
man," and then, waiting until Croupin had driven off with the
girl, he returned into the hall.</p>

<p>The silver-voiced man was now the centre of a little group of
fashionably dressed ladies, and a matronly-looking one, with two
pretty girls, who were obviously her daughters, was pressing him
gushingly to go back with her for a cocktail.</p>

<p>"I would with pleasure, Mrs. Melton," he replied with an
admiring smile at the girls, "if it were not that I am going away
for two nights and am due in town by five o'clock. I'm not even
going back home, but am now going to rush off as quickly as I
can."</p>

<p>A few minutes later then, having seen him drive off in his
beautifully appointed car, in the direction of London, Larose
thought it a splendid opportunity to pay a visit to 'The
Pines.'</p>

<p>"It's just possible I may want to look inside that place," he
nodded, "and now that I know he'll be away, I'll walk up and just
see what it's like. I'll make an excuse that I want to see
Sheldon-Brown about a new carpet-sweeper."</p>

<p>The Pines was an old-world house of two stories, covered with
ivy and surrounded on all sides by flowerbeds and stretches of
immaculately kept lawn. A short drive of about a hundred yards
led up to the front door.</p>

<p>Entering the drive Larose saw a motor bicycle upon its stand,
just near the front door, and approaching close he noticed a
large coil of copper wire tied upon the pillion seat of the
machine. Then he saw that the hall door was ajar.</p>

<p>He pumped upon the electric bell, and although he distinctly
heard it ring in a far part of the house, after a full two
minutes no one had appeared in answer to his call. He tried it
again, but with the same result. Then he gently pushed the door
wider open and looking inside, saw the hall was untenanted. A
large pair of steps, however, stood just beneath a central
electric light, and at the foot of the steps was a gaping bag of
workman's tools.</p>

<p>"Ah! that's it!" he exclaimed. "The electrician's here and
probably doing a line with the maids in the back-kitchen, instead
of attending to his work."</p>

<p>Then suddenly he became aware of the sounds of talking and
laughter in the garden, and, stepping quickly to one of the
corners of the building, he looked round cautiously to see what
was happening.</p>

<p>Then he felt inclined to laugh, too, for about a hundred and
fifty yards away two men and two maids in print dresses were
gathered round the foot of a tall tree, and all of them craning
their heads up and looking among the branches. A good way up the
tree was a third man, and he, with, a long piece of stick, was
vainly endeavouring to dislodge a big red parrot, ensconced
higher up, and with a short length of broken chain hanging from
one of its legs.</p>

<p>The fun was fast and furious, and the girls shrieked with
laughter at the ineffectual efforts of the man with the
stick.</p>

<p>Larose was a quick thinker. "One&mdash;two&mdash;five," he
counted, "the two maids, the butler, the gardener, and the
electrician. Yes, they are all there, and they look as if they
would be engaged for the next few minutes."</p>

<p>Then in a trice he was inside the house and getting the lie of
the land. He ran the length of the hall, looking into every room
as he passed. "Breakfast-room, dining-room, drawing-room," he
muttered. "Ah! and the master's study!"</p>

<p>He entered the last room and ran to the window. It faced the
tree where the parrot had taken refuge and he could see that it
was still uncaptured and the laughter and the shouting still
going on. Then he took a quick look all round the study and he
frowned as his eyes fell upon a safe that was let into the
wall.</p>

<p>"A good one," was his lightning comment, "and it'd be deuced
hard to open! Still, still, Croupin,"&mdash;he nodded&mdash;"I
expect Croupin's pretty smart."</p>

<p>Dismissing the safe from his mind, he next turned his
attention to the drawers of the desk and pulled at them to find
them, however, as he had expected, all locked. Then he glided to
the long French window. There was no alarm attached, but the
bolts were big and strong, and would be very difficult, he saw,
to tamper with from outside. He stood still, in deep thought, for
a few moments, and then seeing that the parrot-party were still
by the tree, a smile overspread his face, and forming a sudden
resolution, he darted into the hall, to return in a few seconds
with a screwdriver and a file that he had taken from the
electrician's bag.</p>

<p>Then for ten minutes, and with his eyes every other moment
upon the domestics outside, he worked like a demon-possessed. He
took out every screw attaching to the big bolts to the window,
pulling up a small occasional table to get at those in the upper
one. Then he well filed all their threads, so that they would
have a poor hold in the wood, and screwed them back.</p>

<p>"Now," he grinned, "one good pull at this window from outside
and the bolts will drop off, and we can get in without any noise.
Croupin and I will come here to-morrow night when we've got a few
things together to tackle those drawers and that safe."</p>

<p>He replaced the tools where he had found them, and then
finding that he was still not likely to be interrupted, made a
leisurely survey of the whole house, noting with satisfaction,
that the servants' quarters were a long way distant from the
front door and that there were no burglar alarms anywhere in the
house. The whole place was beautifully furnished, and replete
with comforts and conveniences of every conceivable kind.</p>

<p>But then suddenly he heard the sound of footsteps upon the
gravel outside and he had just time to fly back and let the
butler find him standing patiently before the hall door. No, Mr.
Brown wasn't in, he was told, and they didn't want another carpet
sweeper, for the one they already had was a very good one. Of
course he could call again if he wished, but he, the butler, did
not think it would be much good.</p>

<p>Returning to Crowborough he had another talk with the
supervisor. "Well, I've seen your Mr. Sheldon-Brown," he smiled,
"and he's all you said, a very charming gentleman." He shrugged
his shoulders. "Still I've got to find out all about him, you
see, and I just want to know who are his best friends here."</p>

<p>The girl smiled archly. "Men or women?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Men," laughed Larose, "for from what I saw at the flower show
just now all the ladies are his best friends."</p>

<p>But then he could get nothing out of the girl, for after
suggesting humorously that if telephone calls counted for
anything the town fish-monger must be Mr. Sheldon-Brown's best
friend, in as much as the fish shop was rung up almost every day,
she could tell him nothing more. Mr. Brown rang up plenty of
people in the neighbourhood, but no particular person often, and
he very seldom made a trunk call, and then always apparently on
business.</p>

<p>That night in Croupin's private sitting-room at the Savoy
Larose went over all he had learnt that day. "But you see," he
concluded, "although we are morally certain ourselves, we shall
have no legal evidence that this Sheldon-Brown is the convict
Bascoigne until we get his finger-prints, and then we mustn't
touch him until we can bring it home convincingly that he's been
mixed up in these crimes. Also, we've got to find who the other
three are." He nodded. "Yes, and until we've got his finger-prints we'll keep quiet, then"&mdash;he looked very pleased with
himself&mdash;"we'll drop a bombshell into the Yard."</p>

<p>"Bien!" exclaimed Croupin gleefully, "and to-morrow night we
are to break into his house and open that safe." He looked rather
doubtful. "But I'm not too sure after what you've told me." He
smiled sadly. "I always called in an expert."</p>

<p>The following morning Larose was early about, and while
Croupin was busy collecting tools for the night's adventure made
an excursion into the city and interviewed his wife's
stockbroker. The latter remembered Bascoigne well, but could add
little to the information Larose already possessed. Then suddenly
the stockbroker's face brightened. "Ah!" he exclaimed, "but I can
put you on to one of Oscar Bascoigne's old servants and he'll
tell you all about him. The commissionaire in these very
buildings was in his employ when the crash came. He was his
valet."</p>

<p>Delighted with this stroke of good fortune, Larose was soon in
conversation with the commissionaire and found the latter nothing
loth to tell all he remembered about his old master. For half an
hour and more they talked together, and Larose, with skilful
questioning, drew out all the salient features of Bascoigne's
private life, his habits, his likings, and how he spent his time
when away from the city.</p>

<p>The interview over, and with plenty of time upon his hands
before he was due to meet Croupin, Larose decided he would go and
see what were the surroundings of the house in Mayfair where
Bascoigne lived, and, to his amazement at the coincidence,
perceived Bascoigne himself step out of the front door, just when
he, Larose was only about 20 yards away.</p>

<p>Much to Larose's relief Bascoigne at once proceeded to make
his way in the opposite direction, walking briskly along with the
gait and stride of a man who was always very sure of himself and
knew his own mind.</p>

<p>"I'll follow him," though Larose delightedly, "for Fortune is
dealing me such good cards now it is quite possible our friend
may be going to meet one of those very nice associates of his.
Anyhow, I'll trail him."</p>

<p>But Fortune was certainly not going to be generous there, for
reaching the Athenis restaurant in Piccadilly, Bascoigne turned
in quickly, and looking neither to the right nor to the left, as
if he were not expecting to meet any one, took his seat at a
small table and picked up the menu.</p>

<p>Larose followed suit, but mindful of the fact that he had
stood close to the man at the flower show and that for a few
seconds those big eyes had rested thoughtfully upon him and
Cynthia Cramm, he seated himself where he was partly hidden from
his quarry by a large palm.</p>

<p>Bascoigne ordered a dozen oysters, a portion of turbot, and a
small bottle of claret that was served in the cradle. He partook
of his meal leisurely and as if he thoroughly enjoyed it. Then
when he called for his bill, Larose saw him put down a pound note
and receive back only two shillings in change.</p>

<p>"Gosh!" thought Larose, "but he must have plenty of money!
That wine then cost him about twelve shillings!"</p>

<p>Bascoigne sat on for a few minutes and then rose up with an
abrupt movement, and proceeded to walk quickly out of the room,
as before, taking no notice of any one in his passing.</p>

<p>But he had not gone 20 paces before Larose was upon his feet
also, and stepping quickly over to the table he had just vacated,
to the amazement of the waiter who had started to clear things
away, snapped up the wineglass from which Bascoigne had just been
drinking.</p>

<p>"Fetch the manager at once, please," he ordered sternly. "I
want to speak to him," and returning to his own table, he put
down the wineglass which he had been holding by the stem.</p>

<p>The manager soon put in his appearance and Larose motioned him
to a chair.</p>

<p>"I'm from Scotland Yard," he said quickly. "Sit down, will
you, and then we shan't attract attention." He showed him his
badge and went on. "What's happened is this. A man whose finger-prints we want badly has just been lunching at that table there.
I've got the prints on this wine-glass and it must be put
somewhere where it won't be touched until our men come down to
deal with it. They'll be here in less than half an hour. You
understand?"</p>

<p>The manager nodded and then Larose said sharply, "Now, call
that waiter here and ask him if he knows who the customer
was?"</p>

<p>"But I'm sure, he won't," smiled the manager, "for he's only
been employed here a couple of days."</p>

<p>"Then make him hold his tongue," said Larose, "for if the man
should happen to come again he must get no inkling that we've
been inquiring about him. Here, I'll speak to the waiter,
please."</p>

<p>A few minutes later then, Larose was again with the Chief
Commissioner and relating to him all he had found out; how he had
succeeded in linking up one of the men of the Gibbett Inn with
both Sir John Lorraine and Mortimer Fairfax, the K.C., and how
through the latter he had determined the man's identity; how he
had scoured the country round the inn for him, and with what
result and how finally, without any shadow of doubt, Cynthia
Cramm had recognised the voice. Then he told of the fingerprints
upon the wine-glass, and how he was sure they would prove to be
those of the convict, Bascoigne.</p>

<p>The Commissioner listened thoughtfully, with no expression of
surprise, and made no remark until Larose had finished.</p>

<p>Then with a nod in which great satisfaction, and yet a slight
annoyance were blended, he remarked:</p>

<p>"Splendid! We did well to ask for your services. Great
imagination was wanted here, and we didn't seem to have it." He
sat up sharply in his chair. "Now what are your suggestions for
our next moves?"</p>

<p>"Tap his telephone, of course," replied Larose, "and note
every call he makes and receives. We ought to get at his
associates that way. Then trail him, but rather lose him than
press him too closely at this stage, for if any of them get the
slightest suspicion, they'll bolt to their holes and be as mum as
dead men. You've only got to-day to shadow Bascoigne from Charles
Street, for unless he alters his mind, he returns to Crowborough
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Well, give me the best description you can of him," said the
commissioner, "as you say he's altered so much from the photo we
have."</p>

<p>They talked on for a few minutes and then Larose said, "Now,
to go off on another tack. Will you send out a call to every
east-end station for the names and locations of every barber of
foreign extraction, with a shop in their districts? Any kind of
foreigner, but I rather think the man I want will be a Swiss, and
also he will live in a commercial centre, and not too far from
the river, perhaps."</p>

<p>"What do you want with him?" asked the Commissioner
curiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a very long shot," laughed Larose, "and I won't
bother you with imaginative details now." He added quickly, "but
on no account must it be known any one is making inquiries. Yes,
and another thing. To-morrow I'd like to borrow a man who knows
the east-end well. However, I'll be here first thing in the
morning and may be have a bit more news for you then. I'm going
back to Crowborough this afternoon."</p>

<p>Some two hours later the Commissioner with an official from
the fingerprint department standing at his side, was comparing
two photographs under a powerful magnifying glass. The
Commissioner had a very frowning expression upon his face.</p>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br>

THE SECRETS OF THE RIVER.</h2>

<p class="first">THAT same night, a few minutes before nine
o'clock, a man alighted from a first-class carriage at Limehouse
Station, and turning up his coat collar and pressing down his hat
well upon his forehead, proceeded to make his way briskly through
the squalid streets. The air was chilly and the river mist hung
everywhere.</p>

<p>At all times, to most people, the mean side-streets of the
East End of London are depressing, but they are particularly so
at night, for then with the houses badly lit they suggest
poverty, as surely as do the gaunt faces of the passers-by. The
dark, and often blindless windows, make one think of want and
hunger, and of ill-clothed human beings, lacking so much of the
happiness of life.</p>

<p>However, the man with the turned-up collar was evidently
troubled with none of these thoughts, for his face was cheerful
and he carried himself jauntily, as if he were upon some mission
of pleasure.</p>

<p>Arriving at the shop of Voisin, the barber, in Rent Street and
finding the door, as he had apparently expected, unlatched, he
pushed it open very quietly, and entered the shop without
ceremony. Then he pushed the door to behind him, but did not
close it.</p>

<p>The shop was in darkness, but there was a light in the room
behind it, and the barber himself was seated there, reading a
newspaper before a small gas-fire. Making no sound, he rose
instantly and advanced a few paces when he heard the footsteps in
the shop, but then immediately the tension of his face relaxed
when he saw who the visitor was.</p>

<p>"Good evening," said the latter with a friendly smile. "Am I
the first one here?"</p>

<p>The barber nodded. "Yes, sir," he replied, "but nine has not
struck yet," and then, without another word, the visitor passed
through the room into the yard beyond.</p>

<p>Almost exactly at the same time another man entered Ah Chung's
dimly lighted shop in the same stealthy manner, and was received
by a bowing figure, which glided like a shadow from somewhere
among the many bales and packing cases that were crowded
there.</p>

<p>The man nodded good-humouredly. "Anyone here, Ah Chung?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Brown," replied the Chinaman, as he now softly shot
the bolts of the shop door, "Mr. Mason came some minutes ago,
and"&mdash;he stood for two seconds in a listening
attitude&mdash;"Sir Charles is now walking up the stairs."</p>

<p>"Well, I want to speak to you before I go up," said Bascoigne.
"I have a commission for you, for which you will be very well
paid." He lowered his voice impressively. "In about half an hour,
a man will call next door, and ask for some canary seed. He is
short and very dark. Take the usual precautions and bring him up
to us at once. Then, when later I knock for you to take him away,
if you see me offer him a cigarette"&mdash;he hesitated a
moment&mdash;"can you arrange that he doesn't go very far?"</p>

<p>Ah Chung's face was quite expressionless. "Why?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We are not certain of him," was the low reply, "and then we
shall have judged if he is dangerous&mdash;to you, as well as to
us, for he has been drinking heavily lately, and we believe him
to have taken some one into his confidence."</p>

<p>"Why arrange for him to come here, if you doubt him?" asked Ah
Chung. "You promised you would bring no danger to me."</p>

<p>"It was a mistake," replied Bascoigne quickly, "and I only
heard of it after it had been done. He went to Mr. Mason's office
this morning, but Mr. Mason could not deal with him as he would
have liked to, because he had brought a friend who was waiting
outside. Mr. Mason saw this other man through the window."</p>

<p>"Then the friend will be waiting here to-night?" said Ah Chung
softly. "There will be two of them."</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Bascoigne, "and Mr. Mason recognised the other
man as a Dick Funnell. He has just come out of prison. He is
stout like this Tod Blitzer. They are cousins, I understand."</p>

<p>"I know him," said Ah Chung. "I know them both, and they are
dangerous men to have you in their power. You should have asked
me before you employed Blitzer. I know many people round
here."</p>

<p>"Well, you see, Ah Chung," went on Bascoigne in an apparent
burst of confidence, "we are taking great risks in supplying
insurgents in friendly countries with ammunition, and if we are
caught it means heavy punishment. But there is big money in it,
and as I have told you, you are going to share."</p>

<p>Ah Chung made no comment, but he was under no delusions, very
much doubting if the business of this Mr. Brown and his friends
had anything to do with ammunition. He certainly did not know
what the business was, but that very morning he had completed the
insertion of a secret panel near the fireplace of the room in
which they always met, and before midnight he was confident he
would have learnt all he wanted to.</p>

<p>"Well, can you manage it for us, if we think it necessary?"
asked Bascoigne anxiously. "It will mean a hundred pounds to you
if you do."</p>

<p>"Two hundred!" said Ah Chung, "for there will be great risk
for three hours. The river is not high until nearly one, and the
flow is not strong then, for half an hour."</p>

<p>"All right," nodded Bascoigne. "&pound;200 and you shall have
the money before we leave." He thought for a moment. "Shall we
give him something to drink before you come for him?"</p>

<p>"It will not be necessary," said Ah Chung.</p>

<p>"But how will you get hold of the second man?" asked
Bascoigne. "He will probably be on the look out for any
trick."</p>

<p>"I will manage it," replied the Chinaman quietly. "My family
will help me."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Bascoigne, and with no more parley he
proceeded to mount the narrow stairs at the back of the shop.</p>

<p>Bascoigne found Guildford and Sir Charles Carrion awaiting him
in a large room on the first floor, with the window overlooking
the river. The ex-solicitor looked worried and morose, but the
surgeon, from the cheerful expression upon his face, was in one
of his brightest moods.</p>

<p>"Killed any one to-day, Sir Charles?" laughed Bascoigne. "You
look so happy."</p>

<p>"I am," laughed back the surgeon. He rubbed his hands
together. "I have but little now of the gold of life to spend,
but what I have, I am spending lavishly." He patted Bascoigne
upon the shoulder. "If it were not that I am slowly dying from
this cirrhosed liver of mine, you would have gone a long way to
making me a young man again, my friend, for I am enjoying
everything immensely." He nodded solemnly. "Yes, I have killed a
man to-day, although he's not dead yet. I operated this morning.
A simple hernia, but I intended complications should ensue, for
he is a bad man and so he'll die to-morrow, or the day
after."</p>

<p>"What's he done then, and how will you benefit by it?" asked
Guildford, his beady eyes blinking curiously.</p>

<p>The great surgeon smiled. "I shall not benefit in any way, Mr.
Guildford," he replied, "if indeed it is in your nature to
understand that, but I am doing a work of humanity by putting
this man away. He is a bad character, and I know him well. He has
a young wife, but he is cruel to her. They have not been married
two years and he strikes her, also he is gambling his money away
and keeps an expensive mistress. He is of no use to any one and
so I feel I am justified in returning him to his Maker. Then his
wife will marry again&mdash;I've heard she has a lover&mdash;and
she will know some of the happiness she deserves. She is a
charming young woman."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't care to be one of your patients," growled
Guildford. "I shouldn't feel safe."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," laughed Sir Charles, "for during all my career
I have occasionally exercised my prerogative in cases like the
one I just mentioned." He frowned. "But I think I should like to
attend you, for you've got a high blood-pressure, I'm quite sure
and also the whites of your eyes, I notice are often yellow,
and"&mdash;but the door opened quickly and Dr. Libbeus stepped
into the room.</p>

<p>"Take your seats, gentlemen," interrupted Bascoigne. "We've
some important business to-night. Switch on that light, please,
Professor, and we'll sit as usual in the middle of the room. The
Chinaman seems all right"&mdash;he laughed&mdash;"but never
forget the old maxim that walls have ears, and I feel safer away
from them."</p>

<p>But for some reason the light he pointed to, a large one in
the ceiling in the centre of the room, was out of order, and the
switch brought no response.</p>

<p>"Call Ah Chung," ordered Bascoigne, "He'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rot!" exclaimed Sir Charles irritably. "Don't be such a
suspicious brute, Bascoigne." He pulled a chair up before the
fire. "I, for one, am going to sit here." He sighed. "Physically,
I feel pretty bad to-day, and I want warmth on a night like
this."</p>

<p>Dr. Libbeus and Guildford at once pulled their chairs up too,
and after a moment's hesitation, Bascoigne followed suit. "But
it's again all my principles," he grumbled, "for I only trust
those whom I've got absolutely under my thumb."</p>

<p>Sir Charles smiled disdainfully, but the other two took no
notice and then Bascoigne went on quickly.</p>

<p>"Now, I went down to Mr. Guildford's office this afternoon and
learnt that an unfortunate happening occurred to-day. Blitzer was
there this morning and demanding an extravagant sum for what he
called holding his tongue about that Kingston Reservoir business.
He seems to think somehow that he's struck a gold-mine in us, and
although he is quite aware that Guildford here could tip him off
to the police for killing that woman in the sweet-shop at Hoxton,
still, he believes that the information he could give about that
bag of arsenic he was paid to drop in the reservoir would not
only obtain a free pardon for him, but also a substantial reward
as well. That is the position, is it not, Mr. Guildford?"</p>

<p>"It's worse than that," nodded Guildford gloomily, "for he's
had two bad bouts of drinking lately, and became very dangerous,
because he's evidently been talking. When he called at my place
this morning he wouldn't go into the back room, and said he'd got
a friend waiting for him outside who knew what to do if he didn't
soon come out again." He nodded again. "I saw that friend, too,
on the other side of the road, watching my house. I knew him by
sight, and he's another drinker, even more dangerous than
Blitzer." He looked rather sheepish. "So, on the spur of the
moment, the only thing I could think of, was to tell him to come
here and meet us all to-night. He'll come at half past nine and
he wants &pound;1000."</p>

<p>"Well, what are we going to do?" asked Sir Charles quickly.
"Can't we get rid of them both?"</p>

<p>"That's what's in my mind," said Bascoigne, "and I've just had
a little talk with Ah Chung about it. He's going to show the man
up here, and then if I give him a signal, well&mdash;he's going
to see that the fellow never goes out again. I'm certain we must
put him away, but we'll try to find out first to whom he's been
talking."</p>

<p>"But what about his friend," asked Sir Charles, "supposing
he's watching outside?"</p>

<p>"Ah Chung will deal with him, too," replied Bascoigne. "He
knows all about it."</p>

<p>They talked on for a few minutes, and then there was a knock
upon the door and the barber entered. "Ah Chung has a man
downstairs who wants to speak to you," he said in a deep,
guttural voice, and speaking with a strong accent. "Is he to
bring him up?"</p>

<p>"Yes, at once," replied Bascoigne, and so, not a couple of
minutes later, a blind-folded man was being led into the room by
Ah Chung.</p>

<p>"Take off his bandage," said Bascoigne to the Chinaman, "and
then leave us until I knock for you. Sit down, Blitzer, will you.
There's a chair."</p>

<p>The man from whose eyes the bandage had been removed for a few
moments blinked owlishly at the light, and then, almost before
the soft-footed Ah Chung had had time to leave the room, blurted
out hoarsely, "See here, you gents. I'm all ready for any tricks,
and you'd better know it&mdash;straight. I've got a pal watching
outside, and if I'm not back to him in half an hour, he's got a
paper to give to the police."</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Mr. Blitzer," smiled Bascoigne suavely, "for no
one's going to play you any tricks. You shall have that
&pound;1000, or at any rate, part of it, if you can convince us
you've not been talking to any one about that little job we
employed you to do."</p>

<p>"I haven't been talking anywhere," protested the man hotly.
"I've not told anything, even to my mate who's looking after me.
I've just promised him a quid to hold a letter for me until I
come out. That's all."</p>

<p>"Well, why are you now demanding an exorbitant sum for work
you didn't even do?" asked Bascoigne sternly. "We paid you
&pound;50 for taking that lime to the reservoir,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lime, be damned!" sneered the man contemptuously. "It was
white arsenic, every bit of it, for my dog licked my hand when I
got home, and was sick for a week. The vet said it was poisoning
by arsenic, he'd got."</p>

<p>"Well, that's nothing to do with the money," smiled Bascoigne,
appearing in no wise disconcerted. "You agreed for &pound;50, and
now&mdash;you come bullying for a thousand."</p>

<p>"I'm not bullying," said the man doggedly, "but him and
you"&mdash;he pointed to Sir Charles and Bascoigne&mdash;"are
swells, and can afford to pay. I've followed you both. He eats at
swell restaurants, and the door-keeper of one of them told me he
was Sir Charles Carrion, and you drive a posh limousine and take
fine ladies out to supper. You must have plenty of money, and I
see I wasn't paid enough."</p>

<p>Sir Charles Carrion burst into a hearty laugh. "We must give
him something," he said. "He's a shrewd fellow, and we can employ
him again." He shook his head. "But not &pound;1000, my friend,
that's too much, much too much."</p>

<p>"Don't pay him any lump sum," said Dr. Libbeus emphatically,
and speaking now for the first time. "Let him have &pound;5 every
week as long as he holds his tongue, and then if he knows that
money's coming, we can be sure of him."</p>

<p>"No. I want &pound;1000," said the man firmly, "and I won't
take a quid less."</p>

<p>"But how do we know you haven't been talking about us?" asked
Bascoigne grimly. "You may have put the police on to us
already."</p>

<p>"Upon my oath, no," swore the man vehemently. "I shouldn't be
such a damned fool to blow upon you until I knew for certain you
were no good to me."</p>

<p>A short silence followed, and then Bascoigne said slowly.
"Well, I'll tell you what I will do. I'll give you &pound;200 to-night, that's all we've got here, another &pound;200 to-morrow if
you call at the bird shop at eleven in the morning, and &pound;50
a month as long as you keep straight. Now, will that do?"</p>

<p>The man's eyes gleamed, but he pretended to hesitate. "All
right," he said after a moment. "I suppose I'll have to take
it."</p>

<p>Bascoigne at once took out his pocket book and counted out
twenty &pound;10 notes.</p>

<p>"Now," he said sternly, "you go straight with us in future and
you'll find it will pay you better. We'll have another job for
you soon, and will pay you well. Now, off you go, and don't you
breathe a word about us to your pal." He held up his hand, as the
man was making for the door. "No, no, you wait, please, until
that Chink comes up to blindfold you. It won't do for you to know
too much about this place."</p>

<p>The man smiled contemptuously. He guessed pretty well he was
in the house next door, for he had counted his footsteps and
also, had felt the night air as he had passed through the back
yard and realised, too, that the smell of the live-stock shop had
gone.</p>

<p>Ah Chung appeared quickly, as quickly, indeed, as he could
make his way from the spy-hole he had made in the wall, and
solemnly, with great care, began folding a length of black cloth
to bandage the man's eyes again.</p>

<p>"Here, have one of my cigarettes," said Bascoigne with a
smile, holding out his cigarette case to Blitzer, "if only to
convince you that we bear you no ill-will." He turned to Ah
Chung. "Now you see him safely out of the street," he commended,
"for we've entrusted him with &pound;200 of our money for a
special purpose, and we don't want it taken from him." Ah Chung
smiled deep down in his inscrutable heart, guessing that it was
the &pound;200 he himself was going to receive.</p>

<p>A few minutes after Blitzer had left the room, a wizened
little old Chinaman shuffled up to a man who was leaning idly
against the river wall about a hundred yards distant from Ah
Chung's shop.</p>

<p>"You Dickee Funnell?" he asked in broken English, and taking
no care to lower his voice.</p>

<p>The man started. "No, that's not my name," he replied sharply,
and a dead silence followed.</p>

<p>The Chinaman looked up and down the deserted street. "I want
Dickee Funnell," he said slowly. "His friend, Toddee Blitzer tell
me to go and fetch him. He drinking in the bird shop."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not this Funnell, I tell you," grunted the man. He
regarded the old Chinaman warily. "Who's this chap, Blitzer?"</p>

<p>"Not know," replied the Chinaman. "He come buy birdseed, and
after talkee with boss, buy rum and drink. He say he have friend
just come out of prison, and he like drink, too. I know nothing
more," and he started to shuffle off along the street.</p>

<p>"Here, you wait a minute," called out the man. He lowered his
voice suddenly. "What did you say about someone having just come
out of prison?"</p>

<p>"Just that he come out," replied the Chinaman. "He drinking, I
say, and talk much about how he going to spend his money."</p>

<p>"Damn!" swore the man softly to himself, "and if the fool is
drinking he'll blab everything." His thoughts ran quickly on. "He
must have told them I've come out of quod. They couldn't have
known it, if he'd said nothing." He hesitated a moment. "I don't
like it, but it seems O.K."</p>

<p>He touched the Chinaman upon the arm. "All right, Chink," he
said. "I'll come. My name's not Funnell, but the bloke may mean
me."</p>

<p>The Chinaman nodded. "All right, then. You follow me. I take
you where Toddee drinking rum."</p>

<p>But the old man was in no hurry and he stopped many times to
peer over the river wall, on to the dark waters beyond.</p>

<p>"What's up?" asked the man at length. "What do you see?"</p>

<p>The old Chinaman pointed with his arm. "That black spot," he
said, "Him police boat." He smiled a toothless smile. "We always
look out police boat here."</p>

<p>They arrived at the livestock shop at last. The door was ajar
and there was a light shining inside. Some one was playing softly
upon a mouth organ in the room behind and there was the cheerful
clink of glasses, and then a girl laughed. The man stepped over
the threshold&mdash;there was the sound of a dull thud, and all
the lights disappeared as suddenly as if they had been blown
out.</p>

<p>A few moments later, the old Chinaman emerged again and,
crossing over the street, leant over the river wall and for a
long while regarded the black smudge he had just been pointing
out, upon the water. He had now got an expensive pair of
binoculars with him, that he had produced from somewhere under
the folds of his greasy clothes.</p>

<p>In the meantime the four men in the room above Ah Chung's shop
had been continuing their deliberations.</p>

<p>"But, of course, ours is not by any means the only
organisation of its kind," remarked Sir Charles thoughtfully,
"and I confess I am rather disappointed. I have been reading up
criminology lately and note that many such societies have existed
before. In Prague in 1885, in Marseilles in 1897, and in Vienna
in 1904, here in Sydney Street in 1911, and&mdash;&mdash;"'</p>

<p>"Never mind about that," broke in Guildford rudely. "We have
other things to talk about now, for I heard a bit of bad news
this afternoon." He paused a moment to look round frowningly and
then rapped out, "Gilbert Larose went to Scotland Yard yesterday,
and was there for more than two hours."</p>

<p>A puzzled silence followed and then Bascoigne asked curiously.
"Well, what's that to do with us?"</p>

<p>Guildford pursed up his lips. "That's what I should like to
know," he replied, "for it certainly means something. Larose
married a rich wife two years ago, and left the Force then, and
if he spent all that time at the Yard yesterday, depend upon it
he didn't go there on a purely friendly visit to any one."</p>

<p>Another silence followed and then it was Bascoigne who spoke
again. "How do you know he was there?" he asked.</p>

<p>"One of my clients saw him," replied Guildford. "He had to go
there to answer a lot of silly questions about where he was when
that jeweller's shop was broken into in Wardour Street last week,
and he saw him going in. Then, just for curiosity he waited to
see him come out." He raised his voice. "Two hours, mark you, and
that Larose is a regular devil!" He nodded solemnly. "I believe
they've got him back to come after us."</p>

<p>Sir Charles Carrion looked very pleased. "Excellent!" he
exclaimed, "for I'm tired of this one-sided business. We've had
everything our own way up to now, but with Larose after us it
will double our danger and our sport." He rubbed his hands
together exultingly. "I know all about the fellow. He's the chap
who makes two murderers grow, where only one grew before, and
disguised as a baby in arms, he handcuffs the pretty housemaid
just as she is handing over the family jewels to the greengrocer
next door."</p>

<p>Guildford looked furious but made no comment, and after a
minute Bascoigne asked him thoughtfully. "What's Larose like?
Describe him to me."</p>

<p>Guildford hesitated. "He's devilish difficult to describe," he
said slowly, "for there's nothing very particular about him. He's
of medium height and build. He's not bad looking and he's fair
with blue eyes."</p>

<p>"Does he dress well?" asked Bascoigne sharply.</p>

<p>"Well, he didn't too well, when a detective," replied
Guildford, "at least when I saw him down our way. Still, of
course, he never wanted to make himself conspicuous then, and I
suppose he suited his clothes to the job he was on." He looked
interestedly at Bascoigne. "But why do you ask?"</p>

<p>Again Bascoigne hesitated and then he spoke very slowly. "I've
been thinking a lot to-day of a man I saw at the Crowborough
Flower Show yesterday afternoon. He was a well-dressed man who
was with one of the Cramm children from the Gibbett Inn, a girl
about fourteen and I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you said you did not know any one at the Gibbett Inn,"
broke in Guildford quickly. "You told us you had never been there
before that day when you got us down to lunch."</p>

<p>"Neither I had," explained Bascoigne, "and, up to then, I had
never set eyes on anybody who lived there. But last month, when
they were tarring the main road that leads to Eastbourne, I went
by several times, and, in passing, noticed this young girl, more
than once, sitting on that form outside the inn door. I could
tell who she was for she's very like Cramm himself, who serves in
the bar."</p>

<p>He went on meditatively, "Well, I saw the man who was with her
at the show twice within the space of a few minutes, and,
thinking things over afterwards, something has somehow made me
feel rather suspicious. The first time, he was standing with the
girl just behind me, and I thought at once that she was staring
hard at me. Then she and the man went out of the hall, but not
five minutes later I found the man close near me again, when I
was talking to some ladies." He frowned. "That's all, but now you
bring up this Larose it sort of makes me wonder about this man
and why, in all that crowded hall, he should have come and stood
by me for the second time."</p>

<p>"Did the man stare hard at you, too?" asked Sir Charles, now
very interested.</p>

<p>Bascoigne shook his head. "No, he never took any notice of me
at all."</p>

<p>"Ah!" came from Guildford in an explosive exclamation, "and
that would be just like Larose if the man were he." He nodded
excitedly. "You take it from me, from what men whom Larose has
shadowed have told me, when he's upon your trail you appear to be
the last person in the world he's interested in. I've heard it
over and over again."</p>

<p>Dr. Libbeus laughed derisively. "And because you meet a man
who doesn't look at you," he said to Bascoigne, "you imagine at
once he must be a detective! It's very amusing."</p>

<p>"There's nothing amusing about it," snapped Bascoigne, "I
don't like to think that girl stared at me, and then that the man
who was with her sent her away, and then came and planted himself
again at my side."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll soon know if he were Larose," nodded Guildford
with a grim smile, "for if he's on your trail, you'll very
quickly be meeting that same man again." He looked round
impressively. "It's part of Larose's method, to get close up to
any one he suspects, even if he's not got a scrap of evidence
against him, for his idea is that he can read the chap's thoughts
and tell if he's got anything to hide." He slapped the fist of
one hand into the palm of the other. "I tell you he drops on
things by instinct, without any thinking out whatsoever."</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" exclaimed Sir Charles rudely. "Instinct is the
servant only of the body, and never that of the mind. With any
problem before them people are often too lazy to think, or
deduce, and so they start guessing instead&mdash;especially
women. Then, if they happen to have guessed correctly, they shout
it was instinct that told them to do this or that, but if they
have guessed wrong you don't hear them, for they hold their
tongues."</p>

<p>"But how could any one have become suspicious about you,
Bascoigne?" asked Dr. Libbeus.</p>

<p>Bascoigne shrugged his shoulders. "I don't really believe any
one has," he smiled. "I think it's just 'nerves.'"</p>

<p>"Of course it is," said Sir Charles reassuringly. "You come
back with me to-night, and I'll give you a draught that will soon
put you right."</p>

<p>"No! no!" exclaimed Bascoigne hurriedly, and he smiled again.
"After what you've been telling us to-night about how you conduct
your practice, your dose might prove too strong."</p>

<p>"But is it likely this Gilbert Larose would be taking to
detective work again," asked Dr. Libbeus scornfully, "now he's
married a rich widow and got plenty of money?"</p>

<p>"Most likely," retorted Guildford instantly. "In fact, that's
just what he would do, for the whole business is just sport and
excitement to him. When he was at the Yard he'd take any risks
and put no value on his life to get his man." He nodded
viciously. "At any rate, I'll soon find out if the gentleman is
now away from his home in Norfolk and if he is"&mdash;he nodded
more viciously still&mdash;"we'll make things hot for him." He
looked round upon the others. "But now, I vote we all lie low and
do nothing more for a little while."</p>

<p>"Oh! no," said Sir Charles instantly. "I don't agree there.
The professor and I have several projects in view and they can't
be put off, either."</p>

<p>"But I've got the wind up about that Larose," said Guildford
irritably, "and I don't mind admitting it. Why not take a spell?
We've done all we set out to do, and got our revenge everywhere
where we wanted to."</p>

<p>"We haven't got all yet, Mr. Guildford," said Bascoigne, his
hand clenching, and his eyes hardening instantly. "Remember, I
haven't touched that scoundrel Mortimer Fairfax yet, and I shall
never have a dreamless slumber until he's dead." He controlled
himself and spoke very quietly. "Come, come, sir, don't let us
disagree now when, all along, we have got on so well.
Think&mdash;we have been good comrades, and helped one another
loyally, and we have none of us shrunk from anything. You put out
that tea-broker at Leigh-on-Sea, who first stirred up the
prosecution against you, and you also finished the solicitor,
Clutterbuck, who was most active in getting your name struck off
the rolls. Then Dr. Libbeus put paid to that one time colleague
of his at Great Leighs, who had denounced him to the police, and
Sir Charles shot Lord Burkington who was the main offender in
getting him certified for an asylum. Lastly, I killed that unjust
judge, and, by mistake, that old clergyman." He made a gesture
with his hands. "So you see by what bonds of law-breaking we are
united, and how each one of us could give the other away."</p>

<p>"But you may be suspect now," said Guildford doggedly, "and
from what you have told us, I think you are. You may be dangerous
to us all."</p>

<p>Bascoigne looked uneasy. "Well, keep away from me for a time,"
he said, forcing a smile, "and only 'phone to me from a call-office, and then be careful what you say, until we have made sure
that no one is inquiring about me." He turned to Sir Charles
Carrion, "Shall you want me in what you are now proposing to
do?"</p>

<p>"No, you will be better out of it," replied Sir Charles at
once&mdash;he nodded towards Guildford&mdash;"but I shall want
him, and I may want"&mdash;he hesitated, a moment&mdash;"to
enlist the services of that Swiss barber as well. Ah Chung
assures me he is a very trustworthy man and has been in prison in
his own country."</p>

<p>"But I'm quitting, I tell you," scowled Guildford. "There is
no profit in cutting throats."</p>

<p>Sir Charles held up one hand protestingly. "But there will be
no shedding of blood in this adventure I am proposing to you.
It's just a little matter of picking up some jewels, of great
value and worth of mint of money." He bent forward in the most
confiding manner. "The proposal is this. One of my esteemed
aunts, Lady Rostrellor, of Rostrellor Court, is giving a grand
ball next week at Addington, and it will be preceded the night
before by a big dinner party. The Rostrellor diamonds and sundry
other knickshaws will be brought up from the bank to figure in
both functions, and with me as a guest at the Court, I thought it
would be an easy matter to arrange for you to step in and
appropriate the lot."</p>

<p>Guildford eyed him with great intentness, but made no remark,
and he went on with his eyes twinkling. "It will be a welcome
diversion from our usual line of business, and put a wholesome
fear into folks of those circles where a vulgar and ostentatious
display of riches is made." He shrugged his shoulders. "Of
course, if you happen to kill a footman or two, it will frighten
them all the more."</p>

<p>"But your aunt, Sir Charles!" exclaimed Bascoigne, looking
very shocked. "A blood relation of yours!"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" replied Sir Charles carelessly. "My father's
sister, and very foolish old woman at that. I have told her many
times that these baubles only accentuate the dreadful yellowness
of her skin, but she pays no attention to me, for she is obsessed
that she looks different from the common people in them." He
chuckled. "So she does&mdash;like an old corpse trying to ape the
freshness of a beautiful young girl."</p>

<p>Guildford was still silent and he went on quickly. "Oh! I may
add, as a relation of the Rostrellor family, that you will be
quite welcome to retain all the proceeds of the jewels for
yourself." He bowed. "I shall make you a present of them."</p>

<p>"But I don't like these isolated country houses," growled
Guildford. "The slightest warning, and you can't get away in your
car."</p>

<p>"But there will be no need for any car," said Sir Charles
instantly, "and that makes the whole business so easy. I have a
little bungalow by the Keston lakes, that has been lent me by a
friend who has gone abroad, not a couple of miles away, and, as a
friend of mine, you can stay there as long as you like and be
quite above suspicion until you are able to get to town with the
plunder."</p>

<p>"But how could we get in?" asked Guildford doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Through the front door that I'll leave open," replied Sir
Charles, "or, failing that, by means of a ladder straight into
the Rostrellor nuptial chamber. I'll drug the old woman and his
lordship, so that you can work on the safe in peace&mdash;it's a
very old one, by-the-bye, and you'll have no difficulty there."
He snapped his fingers together. "Then off you'll creep to my
bungalow and lie low for a couple of days."</p>

<p>"And what are the other projects you contemplate?" asked
Bascoigne.</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing. Mere trifles," replied Sir Charles airily, "and
Dr. Libbeus and I will manage them by ourselves. The doctor
thinks he has now got his type of bomb perfected, and so to begin
with I'm taking a small finger&mdash;one into Burlington House
to-morrow night." He nodded. "I'm a Fellow of the Royal Society,
you see, and shall be attending the conversazione there in our
official capacity. The bomb he's giving me is a chemical one, and
explodes in three minutes upon being turned upside down. I shall
put it in one of the settees." He sighed. "It won't do much harm,
I fear, but it may wing one or two of the other guests and cause
something of a sensation."</p>

<p>"Is that all you are going to do?" asked Bascoigne.</p>

<p>"Oh! no," replied Sir Charles, as if very surprised. "We have
several other places on our list, the British Museum, the Albert
Memorial, the College of Surgeons in Lincoln's Inn Fields,
and&mdash;" he nodded as if he were very pleased with
himself&mdash;"well, we'll see how we get on."</p>

<p>They talked on for some time arranging, to mollify Guildford,
that Bascoigne should keep away from them all until further
notice, and then rising from their chairs to terminate the
meeting, a knock was heard upon the door, and Ah Chung
entered.</p>

<p>"It is all right," he said speaking to Bascoigne.</p>

<p>"Both of them?" asked Bascoigne in an awed whisper.</p>

<p>Ah Chung inclined his head. "And there was no letter upon the
other man," he added. He looked round upon the four of them.
"Will you, please, all go out through Rent Street. There is a
police boat upon the river, and they are watching through night
glasses." His face was as solemn and inscrutable as that of the
Sphinx. "It is better my shop door does not open, for I do not
want a search here, tonight."</p>

<p>"But where have you put Blitzer and the other fellow?" asked
Sir Charles curiously.</p>

<p>"In two sacks, under the counter," was the soft reply. "The
moon will go out in an hour, and then the bodies will go out with
the tide. By morning they will be far away." He spoke, almost
between closed lips. "No one will grieve for them. They were bad
men."</p>

<p>It was Guildford who was the first one to leave through the
barber's shop. He said he was not feeling well and wanted to get
to bed. Then five minutes later Bascoigne crept down the
stairs.</p>

<p>"Cocaine!" nodded Sir Charles, as the sound of the retreating
footsteps died away. "I always thought he did and, to-night, I
noticed his pupils. He's evidently got a bit of nerves and was
actually dosing himself in here. Oh! by-the-bye," he went on, "I
may want you to give an anaesthetic for me in a day or two. I
hope to have a most interesting operation coming on." He laughed.
"Take plenty of opium that morning, for you'll want it to steady
your nerves."</p>

<p>"What's the operation?" asked Dr. Libbeus.</p>

<p>"Rejuvenation!" he whispered mysteriously. "The chance of a
life-time, if I can fit things in." His eyes blazed. "I want a
suitable old man and I'll graft the organs of a youth on to
him."</p>

<p>"Great Scot!" ejaculated Dr. Libbeus, "but where will you get
the youth from?"</p>

<p>"I've got him," nodded Sir Charles triumphantly. "He's in my
private hospital, getting over a simple appendisectomy. Quite
healthy and all that, and I'll use him if I can." He lowered his
voice again to a whisper. "Do you happen to know of any man, say
from 60 to 70, who'd be willing to risk it?" He half closed his
eyes. "Got any relation, you'd like to experiment upon? No! well
I'm looking hard for such a man." He nodded again. "I've thought
several times of Bascoigne, but he's a little bit too young, and
now I've got my eye upon Ah Chung."</p>

<p>"Have you suggested it to either of them?" asked Dr. Libbeus
suppressing a laugh, and thankful that he was on good terms with
the speaker.</p>

<p>"No, and I should never do so," replied Sir Charles, with a
cunning smile. "I should just get them up to my place and put
them under. There's a hefty fellow I know, and he'd help me." He
screwed up his face. "The worst of it is about these Chinamen,
you can never tell how old they are and whether rejuvenation is
necessary. I've asked Ah Chung casually about his age, and he
didn't reply, and the other night I ran into two pretty young
women that the fellow's got there, but for the life of me I
couldn't guess whether they were his granddaughters or his
wives."</p>

<p>"But what about the youth?" asked Dr. Libbeus dryly. "What
does he say to it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!" replied Sir Charles blandly, "for of course he's
not been told." He shook his head. "But he's no good to anybody.
He's well-to-do and a waster. He just golfs and plays tennis and
is no use in the world."</p>

<p>Dr. Libbeus took out his watch. "Well, five minutes has gone
now," he said, "and I'll be off. I'll be seeing you to-morrow.
Good-night," and he in turn, proceeded to make his way down the
stairs.</p>

<p>"We're a strange lot," he muttered when he was out in the
street. "Sir Charles and Bascoigne are both mental, Guildford's
the very worst of bad eggs, and I,"&mdash;he sighed&mdash;"live
only for my opium now."</p>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br>

THE WORKERS IN THE NIGHT.</h2>

<p class="first">GUILDFORD had spoken the exact truth when he had
told the others that he was in a hurry to get home, but he had
lied when he had said he was anxious to get to his bed, for bed
was the last thing he was thinking of then. Between midnight and
the early hours of the morning he was intending to make an
excursion to Bascoigne's Crowborough residence, and effecting an
entry somehow, open the safe that the latter had once mentioned
contained half a million of Treasury Bonds, payable-to-bearer.</p>

<p>Upon Bascoigne's invitation he had paid one visit to The Pines
and had then noted with silent appreciation that it contained not
a few valuable articles of an easily negotiable nature. But it
was the bonds he was after, and with the eyes of an expert who
knew a good deal about safes, he had weighed up the chances of
opening that one, and had considered that they were
excellent.</p>

<p>He had taken good note, too, of the general plan of the house,
and had speedily dismissed any idea of difficulty there. There
were no burglar alarms that he could see, the fastenings of the
windows were nothing out of the ordinary, and even the front
door, he thought, would yield quickly to manipulation with a good
skeleton key.</p>

<p>As he strode quickly along from Ah Chung's, his mind was
running a lot upon Bascoigne, and he made no secret of it to
himself that he was tired of all association with him, indeed, he
knew quite well he would never have joined in with him at the
beginning if he had not been impelled to do so through absolute
fear.</p>

<p>Certainly, with all the fury of a smarting beast of prey, he
had gloated over the thought of revenging himself upon the two
men who, all those years ago, had been mainly instrumental in
bringing about his downfall, but it had been really fear alone
that, in the first instance, had made him join up with the
conspirators. Bascoigne had found out too much about him to be a
safe man to offend, but he, Guildford, had made a mental
reservation at the time. That he would be quit of the whole crazy
lot as soon as he could.</p>

<p>He was terribly, even superstitiously, afraid of Gilbert
Larose, regarding him almost as the Invisible Eve, and the very
thought of the ex-detective always put him in a sweat. So
learning now that Larose had been visiting Scotland Yard, he had
determined to shake off his associates without more ado.</p>

<p>That very night, he had intended, should be the last time he
would go to Ah Chung's, and if he could obtain those bonds-to-bearer, as he was so confidently hoping was going to happen, then
he would clear straight away to the Continent, and by devious
ways get later to South America. He would just disappear, and
leave every one, the three other conspirators included, to
imagine what had become of him.</p>

<p>If he did not get the bonds, well, he would join in with them
in one more throw, and with the Rostrellor jewels in his
possession, clear off in just the same way. He had already a tidy
bit of money put away, and, in any case, could live comfortably
wherever he went.</p>

<p>He let himself quietly into the private house, adjoining his
office, in Mile End Road. The place was in darkness, and he knew
the housekeeper and the other servant would long since have gone
off to bed. He looked at his watch, and then, after a muttered
imprecation at the lateness of the hour his movements were like
lightning.</p>

<p>He changed into a much-worn suit of workman's clothes, put on
a pair of old rubber shoes, snatched at some gloves, and an
automatic pistol from a drawer, and then closely buttoned up in a
shabby overcoat, made his way stealthily into the backyard. Then
for a long minute he stood in the shadow of the fence, darting
his eyes round in every direction.</p>

<p>At length, apparently assured that there was no one watching
from the windows of the adjoining houses, he disappeared into a
small shed at the end of the yard.</p>

<p>Then, if any one had been noting his movements they would have
been very surprised to see him emerge, not two minutes later,
from the front door of the house in quite a different street. It
was one of the small houses there, whose back-yards abutted on to
the yard of the one in which he lived, for like Ah Chung, he
deemed it advisable to possess more means of exit than one.</p>

<p>Then for half a mile or so he strode quickly along, until
reaching some archways under a railway line, in a narrow street
behind Mile End Road, he came upon a man who had just finished
lifting some sacks on to a small lorry. He spoke a few words to
the man, they both climbed on to the seat, the engine was
started, and the lorry went off in the direction of the city.</p>

<p>The lorry looked dilapidated and old, and to a casual observer
it would have seemed that its long life was almost done. The
casual observer would have been quite wrong however for beneath
its shabby exterior everything about the lorry was in good
condition, and the man who was now driving it, known as 'Short
Alf' to his associates, and one of the most expert safe-openers
in the kingdom, was quite aware that if necessary he could get an
easy forty-five miles an hour out of it.</p>

<p>In the meantime Larose and the highly intrigued Raphael
Croupin were parking their car in a small quarry about half a
mile from Crowborough and some three-quarters of an hour after
Guildford and his assistant had left the city, were creeping over
the lawn up to the big French windows of the study in Bascoigne's
house. There was a faint moon showing through some misty clouds.
The whole house was in complete darkness, and the entry, as
Larose had anticipated, was effected without any difficulty.</p>

<p>"But we'll screw back the bolts straightaway," he whispered
directly they were inside the room, "and then if we have to leave
hurriedly there will be no traces of us left behind, and it may
be just thought that some one had forgotten to bolt the windows
before they went to bed."</p>

<p>He saw the door of the study was not closed and crept into the
hall to make certain there was no one moving about.</p>

<p>"All O.K.," he whispered. "The place is quiet as a grave."</p>

<p>Croupin approached the safe and flashed his light over it.
Then at once his face fell. "But this will be very difficult," he
said, "for really an explosive is wanted, or a man who has spent
all his life upon safes."</p>

<p>"Well, quick, monsieur, and see what you can do," said Larose.
"We mustn't be longer than we can help," and taking some pieces
of stiff wire from his pocket he began manipulating one of them
in the key-hole of the first drawer.</p>

<p>He soon had it open and made a whispering comment to himself
of its contents as he went along. "A four-ounce bottle of
quinine! Ah, that commissionaire said Bascoigne was liable to bad
bouts of malaria, contracted in Ceylon! Egyptian cigarettes and a
very long cigarette holder! Some of his habits, I see, are just
the same as they were 15 years ago. A lot of patent medicines,
aspirin, phenobarbital, and by bosh! a half-ounce bottle of
cocaine!" He nodded. "Much of that stuff would drive any one
mad."</p>

<p>Then, one by one, he opened and went through the contents of
all the other drawers, hoping to light upon something that would
help put him upon the track of Bascoigne's associates.</p>

<p>But to his intense disappointment he found nothing at all of
that nature, just bills and receipts and papers of no importance.
However, in the last drawer he came suddenly upon a folded sheet
of newspaper, and, opening it curiously, he started, and then
instantly his face expanded into a broad smile. The paper he had
picked up was a half sheet from one of the magazine pages of a
Sunday newspaper, dated a little over a year previously, and
under a big leaded line, running all across the top of the page,
"Famous Trials Recalled," he read the sub-title, "The Arch-Swindler, Bascoigne Gets Seven Years."</p>

<p>"That clinches it," he whispered triumphantly, "without any
need for finger prints. Now, I wonder if I dare take it?" He
hesitated a few moments. "Yes, I'll risk it. The chances are
he'll never notice it's gone," and so, refolding the paper
carefully, he placed it in his pocket, and, still smiling, tip-toed over to see how Croupin was getting on.</p>

<p>But Croupin, from the very worried expression upon his face,
had apparently been making no progress at all. With infinite
patience, and with ear pressed close to the safe, he had, times
without number, been turning the figures upon the dial, trying to
catch the slightest variation in the sounds as the dial fell back
into its place. He straightened himself up, however, as Larose
approached, and shook his head. "It is quite hopeless, Monsieur,"
he said with a sigh. "It is beyond me, and needs the man who can
hear a fly upon the wall to be able to pick up the correct
figures as they pass when I turn the dial." He looked very
disappointed. "They sound all alike to me."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind," said Larose, in no wise downhearted, "I've
found out something, and we'd better scoot now. Get your things
together, quick," and then almost before the words were out of
his mouth, he raised his finger warningly and placed it upon his
lips.</p>

<p>The faint, but unmistakable click of a key being turned in a
lock came from somewhere close near and was followed immediately
by a rush of cold air.</p>

<p>"Quick, quick," he breathed, "some one's opened the front
door. They may hear us if we go by the window, so down behind
that settee there," and followed by a shadow that was Croupin's
he darted to a heavy settee that stood at the other end of the
study away from the safe.</p>

<p>A full minute of deep silence ensued, and then they heard
whispering, and the trail of a light swept under the study
door.</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu!" groaned Croupin, "but they're coming in here," and
he crouched in the corner, as immovable as the wall itself.</p>

<p>The door was pushed open and a light swept quickly round. Then
a sturdily-built man, followed by one much shorter and of
considerably lighter physique, entered the study, and after
softly pushing to the door behind them, without a moment's
hesitation walked over to the safe.</p>

<p>They were, of course, Guildford and Short Alf.</p>

<p>Another torch was switched on, and then for a couple of
minutes or so, in perfect silence, the two lights played up and
down the big steel door. Then the short man bent down and sharply
swung round the revolving dial several times.</p>

<p>"Can you manage it, do you think?" asked Guildford
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Sure," replied the other, confidently, spitting upon the
carpet, "but it'll take a little time," and, opening a small bag
that he had brought in with him, he took out several articles,
and in a most precise and business-like manner, proceeded to
prepare for his task.</p>

<p>He picked up a little head-light, which he switched on and
fastened to his forehead, with a broad elastic band, a doctor's
stethoscope of the latest type, and a small instrument, like a
tuning fork, but rather longer, and with its two points mounted
on very delicate spiral springs. Then he adjusted the stethoscope
until its ear pieces were pressed firmly into his ears, and next
put the solid part of the tuning-fork instrument between his
teeth, resting the quivering points ever so lightly upon the
safe-door, just above the dial. Then, with the bell-mouth of the
stethoscope pressed firmly against the safe, he began to revolve
the dial very slowly, stopping every time for a few seconds,
after it had passed a figure.</p>

<p>About two minutes passed, and then he winked up at Guildford,
who was standing over him.</p>

<p>"Easy as pie," he whispered. "The first number is nine." He
grinned. "I expect that is the number of wives he's got! Trust
these rich bachelors for doing themselves well!"</p>

<p>Then for about half an hour he worked in intense
concentration, never taking his eyes for one second from the
dial, except when he looked up and nodded to Guildford to let him
know when he had caught another number.</p>

<p>At last, with a quick movement, he rose to his feet and took
the stethoscope from his ears and the tuning fork from beneath
his teeth. Then he cleared his mouth of saliva and spat twice
upon the floor.</p>

<p>"Double nine, a nought, a seven, an eight, a six, and another
nine," he answered. "They add up to 48, and I expect you'd find
that the bloke's age. It's the usual trick, and nearly everyone
puts in a nought." He made a casual movement with his arm. "Hop
in, Boss, and open it."</p>

<p>"Oh! what an artist!" murmured Croupin behind the settee.
"Never have I watched such a great master before!"</p>

<p>With a dreadful beating at his heart Guildford seized hold of
the handle of the safe door and turned it round, but to his
consternation it did not move a hair's-breadth.</p>

<p>"Here, let me do it," grinned the safe-breaker, noting with
amusement his ashen face. "This isn't a kitchen cupboard,
remember. That door's airtight, and wants a hard pull to overcome
the suction," and, accompanying his words, he grabbed sharply at
the door, and it came open at once.</p>

<p>In an instant, then, Guildford was upon his knees and starting
to go through the contents of the safe. There was not very much
in it, but he feverishly picked up packet after packet. Share
certificates, leases, fire insurance policies, legal documents, a
little tray of sovereigns, and a small sheaf of &pound;5 bank
notes! But no sign of any bonds-to-bearer anywhere!</p>

<p>"Damn him!" swore Guildford furiously. "He told us there were
half a million pounds' worth of bonds-to-bearer in here." He
gritted his teeth savagely. "He showed us some of them, too."</p>

<p>"Half a million!" ejaculated Short Alf. He looked very
reproachful. "And you're paying me a miserable 50 quid!"</p>

<p>"Oh! but the bonds might be almost useless," exclaimed
Guildford hurriedly. "I mightn't have been able to get rid of any
of them."</p>

<p>"Well, there are some flimsies, anyhow," said Short Alf, and
he made a grab for the packet of notes.</p>

<p>"No, you don't," said Guildford firmly, pulling him back. "He
mustn't know any one's been here, for we may go to his London
house, and it won't do to make him suspicious." He drew out a
couple of the notes from the sheath. "Here, you can take these,
for if he misses them he'll only think he's made a mistake."</p>

<p>"But what about his desk, boss?" asked Alf looking round. "He
may have put them in there."</p>

<p>"No," said Guildford emphatically, "he's not likely to have
done, and it'll only be waste of time. We'll&mdash;&mdash;" but
he started suddenly. "Hark! What was that?" and in the fraction
of a second both their lights went out. "I thought I heard a
click. Did you?"</p>

<p>"I heard something," whispered back Short Alf, "but I think it
was only the door moving to. Stand still."</p>

<p>Then for minute after minute, they stood like statues in the
darkness, with heads bent forward and with ears strained for a
repetition of the sound. It was Croupin who had made it. His legs
had become cramped, and in shifting his position his finger nails
had struck the wainscoting behind him.</p>

<p>A long time passed, hours almost it seemed to the crouching
two by the big settee, and then an audible sigh of relief came
from Guildford, and he flashed his light again. "No, it could
only have been the door," he whispered, "so come on now,
quickly," and, followed by his companion, he tiptoed out of the
room.</p>

<p>A few minutes later then, Larose heard the catch of the front
door being let very softly into its place, and once again
complete silence reigned.</p>

<p>"And that's how we'll go in a couple of minutes," he
whispered, rising stiffly to his feet and rubbing his chafed
limbs to bring the circulation back. "It's a pity though we
couldn't have trailed them straightaway. The big fellow evidently
knows Bascoigne and he is probably one of the other three. He was
double-crossing Bascoigne by coming here to have a go at that
safe. Still, it's hopeless to dream of following him, for they'll
have come in a car, of course, and theirs may be parked in the
opposite direction to ours."</p>

<p>"But why didn't you bail them up with your gun when you'd got
them here?" asked Croupin very disappointedly. "Then we should
have been certain who they are."</p>

<p>"No good," replied Larose sharply. "We don't want to give any
of them any warning until we can connect them with the murders
and lay hands upon the lot. As for these two men, just now, we'll
get them in another way, for it isn't likely a chap who can open
a safe like we saw this one do is unknown up at the Yard."</p>

<p>But then came the second interruption of that night, a sound
which sent their hearts beating furiously and caused them to hold
their breaths in consternation, for suddenly the telephone bell
in the hall tinkled loudly, and they heard an extension bell
ringing in a far part of the house.</p>

<p>"By the window?" whispered Croupin hoarsely, as they instantly
switched off their lights.</p>

<p>Larose gripped him by the arm. "No, no," he whispered back,
"stay where you are, for we don't know what's happening yet. The
house may be surrounded outside. Those men may have been
followed. Wait a moment and see."</p>

<p>They heard quick padding footsteps in the hall, the lights
went up, and the receiver of the telephone was being lifted.</p>

<p>"But, oh! you did frighten me, sir," came the shaking voice of
a man. "I thought some dreadful accident must have happened to
you. No, there were no callers for you that afternoon. Oh! only
just a man who came to know if you were wanting a sweeper. About
half-past three. Yes, he looked just ordinary, sir! A commercial
traveller! Yes, he was pretty well-dressed. I didn't notice what
colour, sir, but I think it was grey. He said he'd call again.
Oh! you mayn't be back tomorrow. Very good, sir. Yes,
everything's quite all right. Oh! Pluto got away this afternoon,
and it was a long while before we could catch him. He climbed
almost to the top of one of the trees. No, he wasn't hurt at all,
but we were more than half an hour catching him. Oh! it's quite
all right, sir, but the bell frightened us, it being so late.
Good-night, sir. Thank you," and the receiver was hung up.</p>

<p>Then they heard another voice, a woman's this time. "What was
it, Bert?" it asked in very worried tones. "What did the master
want?"</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing," replied the man sourly. "A real bit of
tomfoolery, I call it, and I can't understand why he did it. Just
wanted to know who called here when he was at the flower-show
yesterday, and when I told him only the carpet-sweeper man, he
asked what the chap was like and how he was dressed. Come on,
let's go back to bed."</p>

<p>"Very inconsiderate, waking us up like this," grumbled his
wife. "I thought at least the police had heard we were going to
be broken into. No. I'm not going back to bed now until I have a
cup of tea. My heart's going all of a flutter, and the tea will
do me good." She shivered. "How cold it is here. It's just as if
someone had just opened the front door. Are all the windows shut,
do you think?"</p>

<p>"Of course they are," growled the man. "I shut every one
before I went to bed. Come on and get that tea. I want my sleep,"
and the lights were clicked off and the voices of the couple
became fainter as they passed up the hall.</p>

<p>"Now we must wait," whispered Larose, "and we can't make a
move for a good half-hour. Of course it was Bascoigne speaking,"
he added, "and to my thinking there's something very queer about
it. Why should he be ringing up at this hour?"</p>

<p>"Some idea has suddenly come to him," whispered back Croupin,
"or he's heard something in town tonight."</p>

<p>"But what could he have heard?" asked Larose sharply.</p>

<p>"Well, why should he have suddenly become so curious," asked
Croupin in return, "to learn if somebody had called here on that
flower-show afternoon? Yes, something has certainly come into his
mind all at once, or he wouldn't have let all yesterday go by
before he rang up." He nodded in the darkness: "He's heard
something, right enough."</p>

<p>"But what could he have heard, I say," asked Larose again.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," replied Croupin very solemnly, "when I was against
the law in my own beautiful country I had always friends in the
Surete Generale willing to tell me everything our police were
doing. So why shouldn't it be the same here? This fellow is a
rich man, and with money you can nearly always bribe your way
anywhere."</p>

<p>"He's rich, all right," growled Larose. "You can tell that by
the appointments here and the house he's got in town." He
scoffed. "Besides, that expensive safe there was not bought to
hold the paltry things they found to-night. That half million in
bonds the big man spoke about is much more likely to have been
kept there." He asked for the third time. "But what could he have
heard?"</p>

<p>A long silence followed, and then Croupin asked hesitatingly.
"Do you think, monsieur, that, to begin with, he recognised that
little Cramm girl at the flower show and knew she came from the
Gibbett Inn&mdash;I saw him stare at both her and you&mdash;and
then some one telling him to-night that you were back at Scotland
Yard&mdash;his guilty conscience makes him now wonder if it were
you who were her companion there? Don't forget he asked the
butler just now, when he heard that traveller had called, how the
man was dressed, and he may have had you in mind when he asked
him!"</p>

<p>"Damn!" swore Larose after a long moment's consideration, "but
it's not possible. Your imagination is becoming more drunken even
than mine."</p>

<p>A few minutes later they let themselves very quietly out of
the front door, Croupin holding back the catch, so that it would
click very softly, with a piece of specially-prepared linen
thread. The thread was caught round the handle inside, and was
double ended, so that when the catch was almost home it could be
snatched aside and drawn right away, leaving nothing to show that
any thread had been used.</p>

<p>They found their car unmolested, where they had left it, and
reached town without any further adventure. Larose had taken
lodgings in Pimlico, at the house of an ex-policeman, whom he had
known when in the force, and Croupin was staying with him.</p>

<p>The two of them then snatched an uneasy three hours' sleep,
and then Larose, very alert as usual, was ushered into the Chief
Commissioner's office just as the clock was striking nine.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Larose," said the Commissioner, but without
returning the smile. Then when the door was shut behind the
constable who had shown the ex-detective in, he added sharply:
"Look here, my friend, you go easy with that Sheldon-Brown, for
he's not the man you think. His finger-prints are not Bascoigne's
and nothing like them, either."</p>

<p>For the moment Larose did not take in the meaning of his
words. "I beg your pardon, sir," he said.</p>

<p>The Commissioner raised his voice a little tartly. "Those
finger-prints you obtained yesterday are not those of the
convict, Bascoigne," he replied. "They bear no resemblance to
them at all."</p>

<p>A moment of intense silence followed, and then Larose,
swallowing down a feeling of dire consternation, exclaimed airly,
as if the matter were of no importance: "Ho! ho! they are not?"
He tried to appear amused. "Well, for all that, Sheldon-Brown and
Bascoigne are one and the same man."</p>

<p>The Commissioner, making no reply, took two small mounted
photographs from a pigeon hole in the desk before him, and handed
them across to Larose, who just glanced at them quickly.</p>

<p>"A mistake," he said calmly, "or else&mdash;" his voice
hardened&mdash;"this one of Bascoigne has been deliberately
changed."</p>

<p>The Commissioner looked very stern. "Our finger-print
department does not make mistakes, Mr. Larose," he said icily,
"as no one should know better than yourself. As for any
deliberate alteration of the cards"&mdash;he shrugged his
shoulders&mdash;"well, we won't discuss it." He waved to a chair.
"Sit down will you."</p>

<p>Larose did as he was bid, and keeping a good hold upon
himself, smiled cheerfully again. "Well, sir," he said, "if this
Sheldon-Brown is not Bascoigne the convict, we are up against a
series of coincidences, whose cumulative effect would drive any
mathematician into an asylum. Just listen to me for a moment." He
spoke very quickly. "Yesterday morning, I spent some time with a
man who was this Bascoigne's body servant twenty years ago, and I
dug out of him all Bascoigne's then-habits in private life, his
tastes in food, his mode of dress, his preference in colours, his
ailments, and in short, everything I could learn about him." He
coughed ever so slightly. "Then last night, I effected an
entrance into Sheldon-Brown's residence in Crowborough
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Effected an entrance!" interrupted the Commissioner,
frowning. "You broke in!"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," smiled Larose. "I just undid the bolt of a
window." He spoke very quickly. "It was Sheldon-Brown's study I
went into, and the first thing I noticed was that the chairs and
settee were upholstered in blue leather, and the carpet was blue
and the curtains were blue, also the shades over the lights." He
nodded. "Blue was Bascoigne's favourite colour." He went on.
"Then I opened the desk and in the front drawer saw a long ivory
cigarette holder&mdash;Bascoigne always used a long
one&mdash;some cigarette papers, and a tin of Egyptian
tobacco&mdash;Bascoigne always used Egyptian tobacco, and made
his own cigarettes. Then I saw a gold mounted fountain pen with a
broad, thick nib&mdash;Bascoigne always used thick nibs."</p>

<p>He paused for a few moments to give the Commissioner an
opportunity to make some remark, but the latter was looking
meditatively down upon his blotting pad and drawing circle after
circle with a blue pencil, and so Larose went on.</p>

<p>"Then I came upon a 4oz bottle of sulphate of quinine, with
some of its contents gone." He paused again here, and then added
very solemnly, "Bascoigne suffered from bouts of malaria, and was
periodically taking sulphate of quinine. You will find that also,
no doubt, in the prison records. Finally"&mdash;and his voice
rose to a note of triumph&mdash;"I found this in one of the
drawers," and he whipped out the sheet of newspaper. "Famous
Trials Recalled," and laid it before the Commissioner, upon his
desk.</p>

<p>The Commissioner put down his pencil, and, with a deep frown,
picked up the paper and began to glance through it.</p>

<p>"Notice, too," said Larose, "the words in it that have been
scored under&mdash;and so scored many a month ago, for the ink is
faded, the words, 'neither Mortimer Fairfax nor Sir John
Lorraine, either, for the matter of that, gave him any mercy.'"
He spoke very quietly now. "What do you think of it, sir?"</p>

<p>A short silence followed, and then the Commissioner looked up
and regarded him very solemnly.</p>

<p>"You disturb me," he said frowningly. He shook his head. "It
is unthinkable there can be a mistake about these finger prints,
and yet"&mdash;he spoke very slowly&mdash;"I admit it is very
strange if all these parallels can exist in two different
men."</p>

<p>"Just think of it, sir," urged Larose, "the bouts of malaria,
the same tastes and peculiarities of their habits, the same
engaging personality, the same commanding presence, and the same
bold and fearless imagination!" He laughed. "Oh! And another
thing! They both are great fish eaters. Bascoigne almost lived
upon fish and the 'phone girl at Crowborough said Sheldon-Brown
rings up the fishmonger every day."</p>

<p>The Commissioner sighed. "I'll have another inquiry made," he
said, "to see who filed Bascoigne's finger prints and all about
them."</p>

<p>Larose seemed quite satisfied. "And has the telephone been
used, sir, at Sheldon-Brown's in Charles Street? Have you any
news there?"</p>

<p>The Commissioner picked up a paper. "We could not get in touch
with him at all yesterday, for he did lot come home until half-past 12 this morning. Then at 2.22 a.m. he put through a call to
his residence at Crowborough, and it was undoubtedly his butler
who answered it." He passed over the paper to Larose. "Of no
interest, apparently, but here is the report of the
conversation."</p>

<p>Larose frowned uneasily as he ran through the conversation,
for he was not thinking it was of no interest. To him it was of a
very disturbing nature.</p>

<p>"And that is all, sir?" he asked, after a minute.</p>

<p>"No," replied the Commissioner, now frowning, in his turn,
"for at 7.46 this morning he was rung up from a call office in
Belsize Avenue, Hampstead, and some one talked to him for about
two minutes."</p>

<p>"What did they say?" asked Larose eagerly.</p>

<p>"We do not know," replied the Commissioner with a grim smile,
"for the conversation was carried on in German, and the girl at
the exchange who was ready to take down everything in shorthand
is not conversant with that language."</p>

<p>For the moment Larose looked very crestfallen, and then he
snapped his fingers together exultingly. "Another link in the
chain, sir, for Bascoigne spent many holidays in Germany. His old
valet told me that year after year he went shooting in the Black
Forest, so he undoubtedly speaks German." He shook his head. "But
that conversation this Mr. Sheldon-Brown held with his butler is
very disquieting, for I was the supposed commercial traveller who
called that afternoon, and Mr. B. is evidently beginning to smell
a rat somewhere," and then he related everything that had taken
place that night when he and Croupin had been at Crowborough.</p>

<p>The Commissioner listened intently, and his face brightened up
considerably towards the end of the recital. "Well, we'll take
extreme care," he nodded, "that this man, whoever he is, does not
learn he's being shadowed, even to the extent, as you suggest, of
letting him get out of our sight, rather than that he should
become positive he is under suspicion." He talked on for a few
minutes and then touched the bell upon his desk. "And now you
shall have that talk with the officer you want. I needn't remind
you that Detective-Inspector Quinell should know something about
every safe opener of good repute, or ill, in the kingdom."</p>

<p>Larose was quickly ushered into the inspector's room, and
after shaking hands, and a few remarks about old times, he came
at once to the point.</p>

<p>"Forgive me for not being in a position to explain
everything," he said with a most friendly smile, "but for the
moment the whole problem is very vague, and I can't put all my
cards upon the table yet. What I want to find out is if you know
of any man in the safe-breaking line who answers to this
description," and he at once proceeded to describe the small man
whom he had seen open the safe the previous night.</p>

<p>"And he kept spitting, did he?" asked the inspector. He
smiled. "Well, that clinches it, for Alf Flick is an inveterate
chewer of tobacco. 'Short Alf' they call him, and he's a perfect
wonder in dealing with strong-doors and safes. No, we've never
brought anything home to him, although we've suspected him not a
few times. But he's always had a water-tight alibi whenever we've
questioned him. Either his wife swears he has never got out of
his bed, or his grandmother has never had him out of her sight,
or innumerable uncles and aunts declare he has been with them the
whole time, and always he's been too clever for us."</p>

<p>"What's the occupation of this Alf Flick?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"He's a locksmith by trade," was the reply, "and the banks and
safe-deposit people employ him a lot when anything goes wrong,
for he's a marvel at his work."</p>

<p>"Where does he live?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"In Rooper Street, off the Mile End Road," replied the
inspector, "and I'll come with you straight away, if you want to
talk to him." He nodded. "He's a bit frightened of me."</p>

<p>"No, no," exclaimed Larose quickly. "I'll go alone, please,
for I've got to handle him very gently. It's like this," he went
on, noticing the disappointed look upon the inspector's face. "I
don't want this man for safe-breaking, for I'm after much bigger
game than that. All I want is to talk to him, and no one must
know he's been approached by any one connected with the
police."</p>

<p>He bade good-bye to the inspector, and made his way quickly to
his lodgings, where he found Croupin waiting for him.</p>

<p>"Yes, you'll do," he said, critically regarding the shabby-looking figure before him. "You even look more disreputable and
down-and-out than you need have done. Where did you get the
clothes from?"</p>

<p>"Our landlord," replied the Frenchman, eyeing his attire
disgustedly, "and I believe he found them in some field where
they were scaring birds."</p>

<p>"Well, off you go," said Larose, "and here's the list of
foreign barbers. It's a long one, but I think there are 11 you
had better go and look at first. Seven Germans and four Swiss,
and all not far from the Docks. Now, are you sure you can find
your way about?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Croupin, as he glanced down upon the list. He
sighed. "I tell you, I was in hiding in London once, and lived in
Shoreditch for over three months."</p>

<p>"Good luck to you, then," said Larose. "But I'm afraid you've
got a very hopeless job, with not one chance in a thousand of
picking out the particular barber we want."</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know so much about that," commented Croupin very
mysteriously, and tossing his head. "I've just been giving these
nice clothes a walk round to buy a pennyworth of cat's meat for
our landlady's cat." He grinned impudently into Larose's face.
"You are not the only one, Meester Larose, who can think of
things, and I've thought of a very good idea. Good-bye. Expect me
when you see me."</p>

<p>He left the house by the back door, and certainly no one would
have recognised the lively and debonair Raphael de Choisy-Hautville, in the ill-clad and melancholy individual who was now
slouching along as if the mother of all misfortunes had overtaken
him.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Larose was making quick changes in his own
appearance, and a few minutes later, with his eyebrows
straightened, a little scrubby moustache and certain deft touches
that altered the whole contour of his face, he left the house and
followed along the same direction that Croupin had taken. He was
dressed now in very ordinary clothes, and wore a cloth cap that
had evidently seen good service.</p>

<p>He took the Underground Railway at Westminster, and alighting
at Aldgate East soon found Rooper Street and the shop of Alfred
Flick. It was a very small one, and looking through the dusty
window, he saw the locksmith himself at work upon the bench.
Close near him and seated on the counter was a little fair-haired
child about three, nursing a doll, whilst in a chair behind sat a
rosy-cheeked young woman, barely out of her teens, with some
needle-work in her lap. She was sewing industriously.</p>

<p>Larose felt his heart beating a little quicker. "That's the
chap," he murmured, "and things should be very easy now." He
grimaced to himself. "A happy little domestic scene, and it's a
darn shame to have to spoil it. Still&mdash;still&mdash;we'll see
what Alf. will do."</p>

<p>He pushed open the shop door and entered, and then immediately
the girl, gathering her needlework together, rose hurriedly and
disappeared through an inner door. The locksmith lifted the child
down off the counter. "Run away, nipper," he said. "Daddy's busy
now. Go to Mum."</p>

<p>Larose took in the locksmith with one glance. He looked a
merry-hearted fellow of a lively disposition, and appeared to be
about 35 years of age.</p>

<p>"Mr. Flick?" asked Larose, and when the man replied, "Yes,
sir," he lowered his voice, and glancing in the direction of the
inner door, which was ajar, and added sternly, "Well, I want to
speak to you."</p>

<p>The man's jaw dropped ever so little at the sternness of the
tones, but taking the hint he immediately stepped over and shut
the door. Then he returned to the counter, eyeing Larose very
intently.</p>

<p>"I know where you were last night, Mr. Flick," said Larose,
very slowly, and with no raising of his voice.</p>

<p>The man's face whitened, but he put on a bold front. "And so
do I," he said sharply. "In bed where I suppose you were."</p>

<p>"I saw you open that safe," went on Larose, in the same low
tone, "and the numbers of the combination were nine, nine,
nought, seven, eight, six, nine. I was in the same room, behind
that settee the whole time."</p>

<p>The man's face had gone an ashen grey, and he could hardly get
his breath. "Who are you?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"From the Yard," replied Larose, and he took out his badge and
showed it to him.</p>

<p>The man crumpled up. "You've come to take me," he faltered
brokenly, and then, jerking his head in the direction of the
inner door, the tears welled up in his eyes. "My God! And the
missus in there is expecting another baby in six weeks."</p>

<p>"Shut up. Keep quiet, you fool," snarled Larose. "I don't say
I've come to arrest you. It all depends upon yourself, and what
you tell me. It's that other man I'm after, not you."</p>

<p>Alf Flick drew in a deep breath. "What do you want to know?"
he asked shakily.</p>

<p>"The first thing," snapped Larose, "who was that chap with
you? What's his name?"</p>

<p>The man hesitated, looking the picture of distress, and
Larose, his face dark with anger, raised one forefinger
menacingly. "Look here, you fool," he breathed, in an intense
whisper. "It's all or nothing with you, and you've got to decide
in five seconds. Either you tell everything, or"&mdash;he nodded
again in the direction of the inner door&mdash;"you'll be in the
cells in twenty minutes." He smiled disdainfully. "Remember that
click you heard? Well, what about my camera with both of you
snapped red-handed before that safe?"</p>

<p>The man wilted as if he had been struck. "I'll tell, Boss," he
panted. "You shall know everything, and then perhaps"&mdash;he
caught his breath&mdash;"you'll wait until the missus is over her
trouble."</p>

<p>Instantly Larose was all sympathy. "I'll wait longer than
that," he said quickly, "and, indeed, perhaps you may never hear
any more of it at all." He nodded. "You're a small fish, Alf, and
I tell you it's that other chap I want. Now who is he?"</p>

<p>"Mason, the estate agent," replied the locksmith, looking so
relieved now that he was with difficulty withholding his tears.
"He lives close near here, in Mile End Road."</p>

<p>"An estate agent," exclaimed Larose. "Is that all he is?" and
then intending to remove all regret that the locksmith might have
in betraying his employer, he went on scornfully, "and he was
only paying you &pound;50 to get him half a million in bonds!
Why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He had told me nothing, about the bonds, Boss," broke in the
man quickly. "He just said he wanted to get hold of some papers
that had been stolen from him, and he was sure that swell had
taken them."</p>

<p>"And you know the man he was robbing?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"No, I don't," replied the man earnestly. "I don't know him,
or who he is or even where he lives. Mr. Mason just pointed out
which way to drive the car we went down in, and then after we'd
passed through Croydon I lost all direction." He nodded. "Mason
is a close chap and never tells anything."</p>

<p>"But Mason knows the man, doesn't he?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, he knows him," replied Alf, "and he said he was a rich
bachelor, living by himself. He'd spent one Sunday at the house
there, and knew all about it, and that there were no children or
dogs hanging about. He let out by chance that while my pay was to
be only &pound;50, he'd been expecting to get half a
million!"</p>

<p>"And he's only an estate agent, you say?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"But he owns a bit of house property himself, as well,"
replied the man, "and puts up hoardings for advertisements and
collects rents for people. He does a lot of things and has to
keep four or five clerks to help him." A cunning look came into
his face and he nodded mysteriously. "Besides it's reckoned he
makes a good few quid in other ways."</p>

<p>"What ways?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>The man hesitated. "Well, for one thing, he knows a lot of
chaps who live on what they can get, and when they're in trouble
he provides them with lawyers and tells them what to do." He
nodded again. "There's nothing about the law that he doesn't
know, and these chaps often get off. Then when they find anything
and get away with it,"&mdash;he lowered his voice to the merest
whisper&mdash;"he's supposed to buy it from them."</p>

<p>"When they pinch anything, you mean?" frowned Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply, "when they've pinched some stuff and
haven't got caught."</p>

<p>"And how long's this Mason been living here?" was the next
question.</p>

<p>"Oh! a long time, I think. Eight or nine years."</p>

<p>"Have you done any jobs for him before?"</p>

<p>The man was most emphatic. "No, I never met him until last
week when he came in here and spoke to me. I'd heard a lot about
him, though."</p>

<p>Then Larose plied him with question upon question, often
repeating them in different ways, until he was quite certain in
the end that the man was speaking the truth.</p>

<p>"Well, Alf," he said at last. "It's a darned shame you should
have been up to games like this when you've got a young wife and
kiddies to look after." He bent forward until his face was close
up to that of the man. "You say you had no money saved and it was
only because you were in a bad way, that you agreed to work for
Mason." He spoke very slowly. "Now what do you think then would
become of your young missus, if you were put away for seven
years, and she hadn't a penny and there was no one by to protect
her?" He smiled cruelly. "She's a pretty girl, isn't she?"</p>

<p>The locksmith winced and his eyes took on the look of a
wounded animal. "But I'll go straight, now, I promise, Boss," he
said hoarsely, "if you only give me the chance. I tell you
there's another kid coming, and I wanted that money so that the
wife could have a better time. I thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Has he paid you the &pound;50 yet?" broke in Larose
sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the man, "he gave it to me as we were driving
home."</p>

<p>"Then you're all right for money now," said Larose, "and
you'll have no worry there. So that's settled." He spoke in quite
a friendly tone. "And if you keep straight in future, Alf, and do
as I tell you, you need have no worry either about what happened
last night. Now you shall hear what I want you to do."</p>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br>

THE TERROR BY DAY.</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Larose returned to his lodgings about eight
o'clock that night Croupin had not yet come home, and there was
no sign of him when Larose at last put himself to bed.</p>

<p>If the course of the evening, however, it was reported to Ah
Chung that a slightly drunken Frenchman had come to the lodging
house next door. The Frenchman said he was a chef out of work,
but from the skill with which he performed certain sleight-of-hand tricks for the amusement of the other lodgers, it was
surmised he was a pickpocket.</p>

<p>"Give him more drink and search him," said Ah Chung. "If you
find anything on him, don't take it, but encourage him to come
again. Search well, for he may have been sent by the police. A
pickpocket should be earning more money than to have to come down
here."</p>

<p>The following afternoon about three o'clock, at the usual
slack period of the day, Voisin, the barber of Rent Street, was
seated at the back of the shop reading a newspaper.</p>

<p>Bullet-headed, and of decided Teutonic ancestry, he was a
hard-faced, stolid-looking man. He had shaggy eyebrows, big
searching eyes, a square jaw, and a large coarse mouth with full
lips.</p>

<p>He was reading with his eyes fixed most intently upon the
paper and he was breathing hard. It was the midday edition of the
Daily Cry, and its contents were sensational enough to have
aroused feelings of excitement in anybody.</p>

<p>It was the leading article that was so enthralling him, and it
was referring to an explosion in the Reading Room of the British
Museum the previous afternoon, when three men had been seriously
injured, and to one that had also occurred the same night at a
conversazione of the Royal Society, but happily there, by a mere
chance, attended by no casualties.</p>

<p>Now, it had a duty to the public to perform, it told its
readers, and it was not going to be muzzled and it was not going
to be hushed up. The public ought to be made aware of what was
happening, and it was no good blinking facts.</p>

<p>Yes, a band of madmen, for there must surely be more than one
of them, had, three weeks ago, on the 25th of July to be exact,
started upon a campaign of murder and outrage, and they had got
away with it, too, every time.</p>

<p>The public had, of course, read, it went on, that the one-time
eminent judge, Sir John Lorraine, of Merton Court, Eastbourne,
had been mysteriously murdered just outside his own grounds on
July 25th. They had read, too, that the venerable Archdeacon
Lendon had been murdered, just as mysteriously at Surbiton on
August 8, and that some unknown person had shot Lord Burkington,
the eminent surgeon, at Harrogate, on August 25th. Then, if their
memories were good, they would recall the names of three other
persons who had been killed in the ensuing three weeks, with the
killers all undiscovered.</p>

<p>Six murders in seven weeks and no one had been apprehended for
them! Just&mdash;a terrible crime committed, an empanelling of a
coroner's jury, and a subsequent verdict, monotonous in its
repetition&mdash;"Murder by some person or persons unknown."</p>

<p>Yes, the public had heard all about these murders, but
drugged, apparently, into an unthinking frame of mind by the
interest of other events that had been taking place&mdash;the
Test matches against the Australians, the Davis Cup tennis at
Wimbledon, the breaking of the unpaced bicycle record between
Land's End and John of Groats, and the poisoning of the favourite
for the Manchester November Handicap, &amp;c.&mdash;they had
apparently taken little notice of them, and certainly altogether
failed to realise that they might be crimes of a series and
carried out upon a definite and carefully thought-out plan.</p>

<p>But putting aside all consideration of these half-dozen
dreadful, undiscovered and unpunished crimes, had it never dawned
upon people that in their insane deification of sport they had
been overlooking so many happenings that were now occurring daily
in their very midst?</p>

<p>Had they not noticed how the main public buildings were being
guarded now, and how quiet and unobtrusive, but very grim-faced
men stopped every one who was carrying a parcel, and attempted to
go in? Had it never struck them why the Houses of Parliament had
not been opened during the recess this year for sight-seers, and
how the public inspection of certain historic castles had been
denied 'until further notice?'</p>

<p>"Does no one wonder," it continued, warming up to its work,
"why the&mdash;&mdash;" but the barber stopped reading here, and
with his eyes staring fixedly into vacancy, harrowed his mind
mercilessly in an endeavour to exactly remember certain dates.
Presently his eyes dropped again and fell upon a paragraph lower
down.</p>

<p>"Let the truth be told," he read, "and let the public learn
from what dangers they have escaped, and take warning, too, what
dangers may yet be before them. It is dreadful for us to record,
but it is an open secret in Fleet Street and wherever newspaper
men forgather, that bombs have recently been left in both
Westminster Abbey and St. Paul's Cathedral, and&mdash;more awful
still&mdash;attempts have been made to poison certain reservoirs
in the metropolitan area with arsenic!"</p>

<p>The barber started here and with his eyes almost bulging from
his head, read on the next few paragraphs, in such a state of
mental turmoil that he did not grasp their meaning. Then his
benumbed brain began to function again, and he took in,
"&mdash;somewhere conspirators are meeting to hatch their
dreadful plots; somewhere in some foul den, night after night,
inhuman monsters gather and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu," he gasped, his heart beating wildly, "but it is
they! They are the four that meet here at Chung's! They
are&mdash;&mdash;" but his train of thought was interrupted
suddenly by the clanging of the shop-door bell, and he started
up, to see a shabby-looking stranger enter the shop.</p>

<p>The man shut the door behind him very carefully, and then, cap
in hand, advanced in a most obsequious manner.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," he said with a grand bow, and speaking in broken
English, "I have ze good rasor to sell."</p>

<p>"No," replied the barber in his harsh and guttural accent,
annoyed at being disturbed, "I do not want them. I do not want
any razors."</p>

<p>The stranger started, and throwing out his hands delightedly
proceeded at once to address the barber volubly in most fluent
French. "Then, you come from France and you are the Monsieur
Voisin whose name I see over the door!" he exclaimed. "Oh! I am
so happy, for it is like a breeze from the open sea to meet one
from my beloved country."</p>

<p>"I am not French," growled the barber in the same tongue, "I
am a Swiss."</p>

<p>"But it is the same," went on the stranger excitedly. "You
speak my tongue and you are not of this awful country. We are
then brothers in exile." He took a small parcel from the inside
pocket of his coat, and began to unwrap it. "Now, I have here
some&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want them, I tell you," reiterated the barber with
some irritation, and by no means responding to the friendliness
of his visitor. "I have plenty of razors and shan't buy any
more."</p>

<p>"But these are special ones," said the man, taking no notice
at all of the barber's refusal. "They are the razors of emperors
and kings, and they are worth 500 francs the three. You cannot
anywhere buy better than these."</p>

<p>"Get out, you," snarled the barber, "and clear off quick, or
I'll&mdash;" but his eyes fell suddenly upon the razors that had
at last been unwrapped, and he stopped in sheer astonishment.</p>

<p>They were not the kind of razors he had been expecting to see;
cheap, shoddy ones that were so often brought to him by seedy-looking individuals, trying to make a few pence by hawking from
door to door. At a glance, he realised they were of a most
expensive kind, in handles of real ivory and, as the man had
said, the best that could be bought.</p>

<p>His curiosity overcame his annoyance at the persistence of the
would-be vendor. "Where did you get them from?" he growled,
taking one in his hands and proceeding to examine the blade.</p>

<p>The man hesitated just the fraction of a second. "I found
them," he said, "&mdash;&mdash;in a rubbish tip." He went on
quickly. "That's how I live, and this morning I was raking in one
behind some hoardings near Poplar Station, and I found them,
wrapped up in this," and he held up for inspection the black
piece of cloth from which he had taken them. He watched the
barber like a cat watching a mouse. "I only want ten shillings
for them, ten shillings for the three."</p>

<p>The barber looked up and eyed him with a fixed and intent
stare. "They are stolen," he said curtly. "You have been breaking
in somewhere."</p>

<p>"No, no!" exclaimed the man instantly. "I found them I tell
you, and they belong to me." He lowered his voice to a whisper.
"No one knows I have got them and you are the first one I have
shown them to. I was looking for some one who could speak French,
so that I could explain, and when I noticed your name I came in
here." He changed into a wheedling tone. "Help a poor Frenchman,
Monsieur. See, you shall have them for eight shillings."</p>

<p>"What are you and where do you live?" asked the barber, in
whom desire to possess the razors and fear of getting into
trouble with the police were struggling for the mastery.</p>

<p>"I am a chef, Monsieur," replied the man with dignity, "but I
am out of work and can get nothing to do." He laughed bitterly.
"As to where I live, I live anywhere. Sometimes, I have no money
and then I sleep in the parks." An unpleasant memory seemed to
stir in him and he frowned angrily. "Last night, I slept close
near here, in a lodging house kept by a Chinaman on the Causeway,
but they gave me rum to drink, and for a joke put something it,
and this morning I had a bad mouth and a terrible headache." He
grinned feebly. "But they could not have wanted to rob me, for I
had only sixpence, and I found it in my pocket when I woke up."
He nodded. "Still, I shall not go there again."</p>

<p>"I'll give you five shillings for them," grunted the barber,
making up his mind at last.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;eight, Monsieur," pleaded the man. "Give me eight
shillings. They are worth three pounds."</p>

<p>"Six shillings," said the barber, firmly. "I'll give you no
more than that, and if you do not like it, you can go."</p>

<p>The Frenchman looked furious, and stood hesitating, then, as
the barber held out the razor for him to take back, he made a
gesture of resignation, and forced his face into a smile.</p>

<p>"Bien, Monsieur," he said sadly. "I will take it, for I want
money, but it is throwing them away."</p>

<p>The barber showed no satisfaction at the closing of the deal,
but pointing to a wooden bench against the wall, said curtly.</p>

<p>"Well, you wait there until I get the money, and don't move
about the shop." Then, retreating into the inner room, but,
leaving the door wide open so that he could keep an eye upon his
visitor, he busied himself for a couple of minutes or so with a
pen and a piece of paper.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, returning into the shop, and motioning the
Frenchman over to the counter, "sign this and I'll give you the
money."</p>

<p>The very astonished Frenchman glanced down and read what he
had written. "Received from Nicol Voisin the sum of thirty
shillings for three razors that were given me by my late master,
Monsieur le Brun."</p>

<p>"Le diable!" he exclaimed, "but you said you would only give
me six!"</p>

<p>"And that is all I am going to give," remarked the barber
grinning, "but you will sign this"&mdash;he nodded&mdash;"in case
the police come and say I must have known the razors were stolen,
because you sold them for six shillings."</p>

<p>For the moment the Frenchman seemed stunned, and then he burst
into a merry peal of laughter. "But you are clever, Monsieur
Voisin," he said, "very clever. Still, I will sign, because it is
quite safe and the police will never come. As I say, I have shown
them to no one but you," and he took the pen that the barber was
holding out, and with a grand flourish wrote the name, 'Alexandre
Nation,' adding with a grim smile, 'with best thanks.'</p>

<p>The barber, now for the first time, allowed his features to
relax. "And you would like something to drink?" he asked slowly,
and as if some idea were forming in his mind.</p>

<p>"Not rum!" exclaimed the Frenchman, at once beginning to look
very suspicious.</p>

<p>"No, good wine," replied Voisin. "I have some here."</p>

<p>And so, a couple of minutes later, the two were drinking in
quite a friendly fashion in the inner room.</p>

<p>"And where were you working, Monsieur Nation?" asked Voisin
presently, "before you lost your job?"</p>

<p>"Here in London," replied the Frenchman promptly, "at the
Semiris Hotel. I was under-chef there, and should have been full
chef soon, if my enemies had not conspired against me."</p>

<p>"So, so," said Voisin sympathetically, "you made enemies, did
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and they brought false accusations against me," went on
Nation, speaking with an assumption of great wrong. "Some
jewellery was taken out of one of the visitor's rooms, and they
said I had done it."</p>

<p>"And, of course, you hadn't!" smiled Voisin.</p>

<p>The Frenchman smiled back. "Of course not," he replied. "But
they said I had made a master key and could get into all the
rooms." He nodded scornfully. "At any rate they could prove
nothing, although they sent me away."</p>

<p>They chatted on about Geneva and Paris, from where they
respectively came and the barber seemed very interested about the
police system of the latter city, asking many questions to which
the obliging Monsieur Nation was able to give full replies.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the bell of the shop tinkled and to the
annoyance, so it seemed, of the barber three customers came in
all together at the same time.</p>

<p>"But I will come and see you again, perhaps," nodded the
Frenchman in bidding good-bye, and then his voice sank to the
deepest of whispers as he added significantly, "I often have
things that I do not know where to sell, and much better than
razors some times."</p>

<p>The barber was very preoccupied all the remainder of that day,
and twice had to apologise most profusely for the cutting of a
customer's chin. Then the moment the day's work was finished, he
put the copy of the Daily Cry into his pocket and made his way
round through the street to Ah Chung's.</p>

<p>"Have you seen this?" he whispered breathlessly, pointing to
the leading article that had so startled him. "I believe it is
the men who meet here and they have nothing to do with ammunition
as they say."</p>

<p>"But I have seen the boxes of cartridges," lied Ah Chung
blandly, after one quick glance down at the paper. "They are
stored in a warehouse in Tooley Street, and I am arranging for
their shipment."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Voisin looking very crest-fallen. "I thought
we could have made some more money by telling them we knew." His
face cleared and he produced the three razors he had bought from
the Frenchman and the receipt he had obtained from him, as well.
"See," he went on, "a man came into my shop this afternoon and I
bought these razors. I wished I hadn't afterwards, for my
customers are not the sort to buy them. Will you take them? I
paid ten shillings each. Here is the receipt."</p>

<p>The Chinaman examined the razors critically. "They were
stolen," he said, "and you were wise to get a receipt. They are
worth more than ten shillings." He considered. "They would be
difficult for me to sell, too, but I will give you one pound for
the three," and the barber, knowing quite well it would be
useless to argue with Ah Chung, accepted the offer, grinning
covertly to himself, however, as he pocketed the treasury
note.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Larose, returning to his lodgings in Pimlico
about 6 o'clock, found Croupin waiting for him. The latter had
discarded his out-of-work garments and was now attired in his
proper clothes.</p>

<p>"And where are you off to?" asked Larose sharply. "You are
supposed to be helping me, but certainly, not in that get-up."</p>

<p>"Patience, patience! Meester Larose," exclaimed Croupin, all
smiles. "I have earned a good dinner, and have been starved for
two days." He screwed up his face inquiringly. "But tell me
first, have you found out anything?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded. "Yes, quite a lot," he replied, looking very
pleased with himself, "for the Yard were able to put their
fingers at once upon the man who opened that safe, and I
frightened him into telling all about the other one who had been
with him," and he proceeded to relate very quickly all that had
happened.</p>

<p>"Then you have actually recognised the big man, in this estate
agent of Mile End Road?" asked Croupin gleefully.</p>

<p>"Oh! Yes," replied Larose at once, "there is no doubt about
it. I have been in his office twice to-day, as a prospective
tenant of one of his houses. I have not actually spoken to him,
for one of the clerks has attended to me both times but I have
had a good close-up view and heard him talking, too." He nodded.
"He looks a determined and capable man to me, and very
clever&mdash;much too clever to be pottering about in the East
End. Of course, he is being shadowed closely now, but up to this
evening he has not left his house. We'll trip him soon, though,
and another thing&mdash;we must get hold of his finger-prints,
for he looks a man with a past to me." He looked intently at
Croupin. "But now, have you any news?"</p>

<p>Croupin grinned. "Nothing much," he replied shaking his head
carelessly, "except that I have marked down a German-Swiss barber
who is a great scoundrel, who smokes cigarettes of black tobacco,
and who lives near some Chinaman who comes from Hankow." He
nodded significantly. "Yes, and one of these Chinamen keeps an
evil-smelling live-animal shop, almost at the very back of this
barber's house."</p>

<p>Larose made no attempt to hide his astonishment. "What!" he
exclaimed with widely-opened eyes. "You've found him already? How
on earth did you manage it?"</p>

<p>Croupin laughed. "It was the smell, Monsieur," he explained,
with his eyes sparkling, "and I was like a blood-hound on the
trail!" He explained quickly. "It happened in this way. When I
put on those dreadful clothes you ordered for me, our landlady
here was all amusement at my appearance. 'Never mind, sir,' she
said. 'You do not look as bad as my cats-meat man, for he looks
really terrible.'" He made a gesture of disgust. "But I doubted
her. So, as she wanted some meat for her cat, I went to the man's
shop to see. It is only two streets from here, and he keeps cats
and dogs for sale, and other animals, and there was a dreadful
smell. I asked him if trade was good, and he looked angry at
once, because he told me the foreigners were spoiling everything.
'The dam Chinks by the docks,' he said. 'They get all the goods
things from the sailor-men as they come off the ships and can
sell cheaper than me.'"</p>

<p>Croupin paused for a few moments, as if to tantalise Larose,
and then snapping his fingers together exultingly, went on. "So
the great idea came to me, the evil smell of caged animals for
sale and the Chinaman by the docks! What more could I want?"</p>

<p>"Splendid, Monsieur," exclaimed Larose enthusiastically. "It
was a real brain-wave!"</p>

<p>"So I tramped round the docksides," continued Croupin, "with
my eyes skinned for Chinamen who sold animals, and a barber with
a Swiss or German name over his shop, and I soon found them close
together, a barber called Voisin, and an animal shop on Limehouse
Causeway. The barber lives in a low quarter in Rent Street, and
behind his house are three other houses, facing the river, all
kept by Chinamen. One is the animal place, the next is a shop
that sells ropes and lamps for ships, and the third is a lodging
house."</p>

<p>He paused again here to sigh deeply, and then related how
troubled he had been to make up his mind what to do next.</p>

<p>He had realised that to make any progress in his
investigations he must get in touch with the Chinaman somehow,
but he did not forget also, that if the Chinamen were what they
supposed them to be, and in league with murderers, then it would
be a very risky proceeding to place himself in their hands. He
had hesitated a long while, but had finally resolved to spend a
night in the lodging-house, and knowing something of the nature
of these places, and how it was quite likely he would be searched
when he was asleep, he had had to arrange that he should be
carrying nothing upon him that would excite any suspicion. So he
had wrapped his watch and nearly all the money he had about him,
some &pound;9 odd, in treasury notes and silver, in a piece of
newspaper, keeping out only two shillings and a few coppers. Then
he had bought a penny piece of chewing gum and entering an old
ivy-covered church off the East India Dock Road&mdash;it was just
five o'clock and evensong was being sung&mdash;he had knelt down
in a pew at the back and stuck his little packet of money on to
the underneath part of the seat with the now well-chewed gum.</p>

<p>"And it was so sad, Meester Larose!" he said, and as if even
now almost choking with the memory. "There was the beautiful
music, with the organ notes so sweet they might have come from
heaven, there was the light so dim and holy; there was the
incense as an opiate for the sick and weary brain; and
I&mdash;was worrying that my piece of gum might fall off the
bottom of the pew, and thinking all the time of that smell in the
animal shop, and whether I should get a knife stuck into me
before the morning came, I tell you I was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get on, Monsieur," interrupted Larose testily. "Tell me what
happened. Never mind these thoughts of yours."</p>

<p>Croupin looked reproachful, but then quickly related how he
had had some brandy to make him smell of drink, how then he had
paid sixpence for his mattress in the lodging house, and sixpence
for his supper, and how to dispel all suspicion that he was
anything but what he was making himself out to be, he had
pretended to be partly drunk.</p>

<p>The supper had been a nauseous one, but he had eaten it and
then to ingratiate himself with the other lodgers, of whom he had
been asking guarded questions, he had proceeded to amuse them
with some sleight-of-hand tricks. Then the old Chinaman who kept
the lodging house, as a gesture of great goodwill, had brought
him a glass of rum, and he had not dared to refuse it, because
pretending to be in liquor already, it might have made the man
suspicious at once.</p>

<p>Then he knew almost at once that he had been drugged, for he
could not keep his eyes open, and very soon he remembered nothing
more. He woke up in the morning with a bad headache, but he was
very thankful to find he had wakened at all.</p>

<p>"Then as I stumbled out into the street, Monsieur," he said,
"so thankful for the cold morning air, I passed the shop where
they sell the ropes and candles for the ships, and I saw another
Chinaman standing at the door. He did not turn his head as I came
up, but his eyes moved on a swivel and met mine, and they were
cruel as Satan's." He threw out his hands. "Never have I seen
such a pitiless face&mdash;and I could feel that he was watching
me, too! He was undoubtedly the proprietor of the shop and the
name over the door was Ah Chung."</p>

<p>Then Croupin related how he had retrieved his money from the
church, and then with what disfavour and suspicious glances he
had been regarded, when in his soiled and shabby clothes, he had
gone into a high-class cutlery shop in the West End, and
announced that he wanted to buy some of the best razors that they
had.</p>

<p>"They looked and looked," he laughed merrily, "and came and
stared as if they thought I was going to steal the door-mat or
run off with the counter, until in the end I had to tell them I
had won a big prize in the Irish Sweep. Then they were all
smiles, and called the manager, and he wanted to sell me lots of
other things. It was a great joke and I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get on," broke in Larose. "What did you want razors for?"</p>

<p>Croupin smiled tantalisingly, but then becoming painfully
aware that he was very hungry, he finished the recital of all
else that had happened to him as expeditiously as he could.</p>

<p>"Now, Meester Larose," he exclaimed triumphantly, "I shall
cultivate that Monsieur Voisin and it will be easy. He drinks
like a fish, for there were many bottles in the cupboard in his
room, and to-morrow I will go in and sell him something
more."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Larose. "I have a better plan than that." He
patted him approvingly upon the shoulder. "You have done
splendidly Monsieur de Choisy-Hautville, and I am proud to be
working with you,"&mdash;he raised his hand warningly&mdash;"but
we must do some team-work now. You just listen to me."</p>

<p>He considered for a few moments, and then nodded confidently.
"Now I will not for one moment entertain the thought that the
mistake about those finger-prints of Bascoigne's is at my end. We
shall probably learn what has happened soon, but I am as certain
as I have ever been of anything in my life that Sheldon-Brown is
Bascoigne and that Bascoigne is Sheldon-Brown."</p>

<p>He ticked off the points on his fingers. "Well, we have
undoubtedly linked up Sheldon-Brown with the murders, and we have
now linked up the estate agent with Sheldon-Brown. Mason knows
this Brown to some considerable point of intimacy, because we
heard him tell Alf. Flick that Brown had upon some occasion shown
him, Mason, some of those absent bonds-to-bearer, and he would
certainly not have done that to anyone he was only acquainted
with in a casual way."</p>

<p>He thought for a moment and then went on. "Now, you by a
splendid piece of work, bring this barber and the Chinaman from
Hankow into the picture, but for the moment there
is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No connection between them and the other two," broke in
Croupin impatiently. "I know that, Monsieur"&mdash;he looked very
woe-begone&mdash;"but for the love of heaven, do not expect me to
think and reason upon an empty stomach. Come out for a meal now,
and we'll talk it over then."</p>

<p>Larose sighed. "All right, de Choisy-Hautville," he replied.
"You are carnal-minded, but I could do with a peck, too."</p>

<p>The following afternoon at about the same time that he had
visited the barber the previous day, the Frenchman pushed open
the door of the shop and flung himself breathlessly into the
operating chair.</p>

<p>"Quick, start lathering me, Monsieur," he called out to the
astonished barber, who was in the act of sharpening a razor. "I
will explain in a minute, but put on the lather, please,
quick."</p>

<p>For a few seconds the barber stared at him open-mouthed, but
then picking up a shaving brush and starting to comply with the
request, he was interrupted by the sharp clicking of the shop
door, and a big burly-looking man entered quickly.</p>

<p>"Know this fellow?" he asked, addressing the barber with no
ceremony, and jerking his thumb in the direction of the hard-breathing Croupin.</p>

<p>Voisin felt an uncomfortable choking in his threat, for
everything about the newcomer spoke of 'plain-clothes man' from
some police station, but he put on a stolid look and pretended to
be rather deaf.</p>

<p>"What do you say?" he asked gruffly.</p>

<p>"Do you know the fellow?" repeated the man in a much louder
tone.</p>

<p>The barber looked closely at Croupin. "No-o," he replied
slowly. "He's a stranger to me. I have never seen him
before."</p>

<p>The burly man nodded significantly. "Well, just keep an eye on
him," he snarled. "That's all." He gave Croupin a nasty look. "He
ought to have been gaoled long ago, but he's been too clever for
us up to now. He keeps bad company, and we are pretty certain he
picks pockets when he gets the chance. So you look out." He
nodded again. "He saw me up the street just now and bolted in
here. But I'd spotted him."</p>

<p>"Oh! no, zat is not so," began Croupin protestingly. "I vanted
a shave and I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep your mouth shut," broke in the man roughly. He turned to
the barber again. "Now, you mind, I've warned you, and if he
steals anything from you, it's your look out," and turning on his
heel, he strode out of the shop and banged the door to behind
him.</p>

<p>A moment's silence followed, and then the barber said angrily,
"And off you go, too, Monsieur Nation, for I see you will bring
trouble upon me if I don't look out."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Croupin, shaking his head. "It is all bluff.
They have nothing against me. That man is always a great bully."
He settled himself comfortably in the chair. "Give me a shave,
please. I will pay you. I have money now."</p>

<p>"No," said the barber firmly. "You will leave my shop at once.
I will not shave you."</p>

<p>"All right," said Croupin shrugging his shoulders, with a
smile. "Just as you like. I will go," and then getting out of the
chair he stooped suddenly and made to pick up a crumpled up piece
of paper that was lying upon the floor. But his movement was ill-judged, for although he certainly got hold of the paper, it
slipped away from his hand, making a hard sound as it fell on to
the linoleum. Then something rolled out of it, and only a
lightning grab on the part of the Frenchman prevented the object,
whatever it was, from rolling under the chair.</p>

<p>The barber started. "What's that you picked up?" he asked.
"It's a ring. It belongs to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Monsieur, it doesn't," said Croupin coolly, putting
his hand and whatever he had picked up into his pocket. "It is
mine and I dropped it on purpose when that nosey policeman came
in. I didn't want him to find it on me."</p>

<p>The barber thought like lightning. Of course, he told himself,
the ring was stolen and he could give the Frenchman up to the
police, on the other hand&mdash;on the other hand the man had
shown himself such a poor bargainer the previous day, that it was
quite possible, he, Voisin, might make a good purchase again.</p>

<p>"Show me the ring," he said peremptorily.</p>

<p>The Frenchman hesitated and gave a half-glance round to the
door. But the door was shut, and if he indeed had meditated a
quick get-away, he at once thought better of it. So now, smiling
amiably, he withdrew his hand from his pocket, and held up for
inspection a beautiful diamond ring upon his second finger.</p>

<p>"It is a lovely thing," he said proudly, "and worth quite
&pound;200, for the stones are of the purest water."</p>

<p>"They are only paste," scoffed Voisin, with his heart beating
quickly, for he sensed instinctively possibilities of great
profit.</p>

<p>"Paste!" sneered Croupin, and in two seconds he had darted
over to the mirror and made a deep scratch down the side of the
glass. "Would paste do that?"</p>

<p>"Then it is stolen!" exclaimed the barber. "You have been
robbing somewhere!"</p>

<p>"No, no, I haven't," expostulated Croupin. He grinned
impudently. "I just found it, months and months ago." He nodded
significantly. "So many months ago that it is now probable it is
forgotten it was lost."</p>

<p>The barber swallowed the bait. "What are you going to do with
it then?" he growled. "You'll be pinched at once if you offer it
to any jeweller."</p>

<p>Croupin was all confidence at once. "That is my difficulty,"
he said, with a very troubled expression. "I found this
ring"&mdash;he nodded again&mdash;"and lots of other jewellery,
too, that I have hidden away where no one knows." He pointed to
his worn and dirty clothes. "But I can sell nothing to any one in
these."</p>

<p>Voisin made no comment, but crossing to his shop door he
opened it and for a long while stood looking up and down the
street. Then he returned into the shop and carefully closing the
door after him, regarded Croupin with a hard and stoney
stare.</p>

<p>"You have been in prison?" he asked. "You look a regular thief
to me."</p>

<p>Croupin smiled with the confidence of one who could keep his
own counsel. "I have had my troubles, Monsieur, in my own
country," he replied quietly, "but no one has got anything on me
over here." His eyes flashed in amusement. "I work always with a
settled plan and if I find anything I don't rush off to sell it
at once." He shook his head. "No, I keep quiet until all the
excitement has died down. I am in no hurry and I wait my time."
He sighed and looked down again at his clothes. "But it is not
often I am as short of ready money as I am now."</p>

<p>Voisin made up his mind at last. "Go in there," he said,
pointing in the direction of the inner room, "and I will have a
little talk with you and we can drink again." He frowned. "But
I'll shut this shop door first, so that if any one comes they'll
only think I've gone out to get a drink." He smiled a meaning
smile. "I often do."</p>

<p>Then, in the talk that followed, an amusing little comedy
ensued with the lively Raphael Croupin in his best dramatic and
imaginative vein. The good wine of his country stirring in him he
threw all reserve to the winds and told frankly of his one-time
association with the underworld of Paris. How although really a
chef by profession, he had sometimes pursued other avocations,
and in unlawful ways had gained entrance into many a lordly
chateau in the dead of night! How he helped in the robbery of
valuable pictures and jewels, how he had worked with Mank,
Labellier, and Ravahol, and with others, too, whose names were
written broad and deep in the annals of dark crime!</p>

<p>But he had been fortunate in big robberies, he explained, and
escaped when all the others had fallen into the clutches of the
law.</p>

<p>Then he told how he had come to England and obtained
employment in the luxurious Semiris Hotel, which catered only for
the very rich, and there, whilst working in the kitchen had kept
his eyes open to benefit himself in other ways.</p>

<p>One day, for a few minutes, he had managed to get possession
of the master key that opened all the rooms in the hotel, and
taking a wax impression of it, had had one made for himself.</p>

<p>Then awaiting his opportunity, he had abstracted the jewel
case of a great lady who was staying in the hotel, but had hidden
them away in a place he knew of, where they were not likely to be
found, however thorough a search were made for them.</p>

<p>"All except the ring, Monsieur," he chuckled to the raptly
listening barber, "and that I screwed up in a piece of paper, and
thrust into the middle of a potato. Then I threw the potato out
into the yard, where I knew I should be able to find it again. It
rolled into the gutter on the top of one of the washhouses, and I
came back two nights after I had been sent away and got it."</p>

<p>"Then you were sent away from the hotel!" said Voisin.</p>

<p>"Yes, for I was suspected at once," replied Croupin. "I had
not taken the jewels one hour before they were missed. Then a
waiter, whose girl had come to like me better than she liked him,
reported to the manager that he had seen me in the corridor, and
they did not think the explanation I gave for being there was
good enough." He laughed merrily. "I told them I had seen a rat
run up the stairs, and had followed it to try and kill it. But
they put me in a little room with two of the porters to guard me,
and sent for the police. Then I was searched and questioned until
my throat was hoarse and dry with answering. But they could find
out nothing, and they had to let me go. Then I was sent away with
no character."</p>

<p>The barber regarded him very suspiciously. "I don't think I
believe you," he said slowly. "You may be telling me all
lies."</p>

<p>"But I am not," expostulated Croupin quickly. "I tell you,
man, I only want decent clothes and then I will go back to that
hotel in disguise, as a visitor, and pick up those jewels." He
drew himself up proudly. "I can look as well as any of the other
visitors, for my family were rich once, and my father was of the
French mobility."</p>

<p>"But how dare you tell me all this?" asked Voisin, screwing up
his eyes suspiciously. "I may inform the police at once! You
don't know me!"</p>

<p>"Oh! don't I?" replied Croupin. "But I do, mon ami." He
laughed mockingly. "You are as big a thief as I am, for you only
gave me six shillings for those razors yesterday afternoon, and
that very morning a woman had bought them in Bond Street for six
guineas. I pinched them out of her car and the price was on the
bottom of the case before I threw it away. She was giving them to
her husband, for there was a card inside, 'From your loving wife,
Hilda.'" He chuckled. "Yes, you are worse than I am, for you rob
the very poor and I rob only from the rich."</p>

<p>The barber looked uncomfortable, but he had another shot
ready, for he knew if Croupin had spent the night, as he said he
had done, in the lodging house kept by the family of Ah Chung, a
valuable ring would not by any chance have escaped their notice
after a drink of doped rum.</p>

<p>"And where then have you been keeping this ring, Monsieur
Nation?" he asked in as casual a tone as he could assume. "Do you
always carry it about with you?"</p>

<p>Croupin looked most astonished at the question.</p>

<p>"No! no! no!" he exclaimed with great emphasis, "I am not
quite such a fool as that." He pointed again to his clothes.
"Why! if some screeching woman in a crowd called out one day that
she had been robbed and I were near her"&mdash;he made an
expressive gesture with his hands&mdash;"well, dressed like this,
wouldn't everybody suspect me at once, and what then would
happen, even if they got nothing else, if a valuable ring were
found in my pocket?"</p>

<p>"Well, where do you keep it?" asked the barber. "You've told
me you've got no home, and sleep anywhere you can."</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha!" laughed Croupin, "I may have no home, but there are
plenty of hiding places in London that I know of." He chuckled.
"I tell you what I do. I screw it up tight in a piece of
newspaper and hide it in some churchyard. I push it down by the
side of some tomb-stone, and it is always safe. Last night it was
in a churchyard in Bethnal Green."</p>

<p>Voisin hesitated no more. "I'll give you &pound;4 for it," he
said. "Take it or leave it."</p>

<p>Croupin looked highly amused. "&pound;4!" he exclaimed. "It is
a joke! I want &pound;60 for it, for it is worth &pound;200."</p>

<p>"Well then, I shall tell the police," replied Voisin angrily,
and rising from his chair. "I shall tell them at once."</p>

<p>"No, you won't," said Croupin retaining his seat and unasked,
helping himself to another of the barber's cigarettes. "You are
not such a fool as that, for I should tell them of the wine you
have given me and about those razors I sold you yesterday." He
nodded. "They would believe some of it, and you would be a marked
man for ever afterwards. Besides my friend, you would get nothing
out of it, whereas"&mdash;he threw out his hands again&mdash;"if
you help me, the profit on this ring is not one fiftieth of the
profit you will get from the other jewels. But you look here,"
and diving into his pocket he produced a crumpled piece of paper,
and spreading it out, thrust it under the barber's eyes.</p>

<p>"This is the list of the jewels that the woman had written in
the lid of the case," he went on, "and I have got them all.
Rings, brooches, bangles, pendants, and a rope of pearls. I had
not time to go through them"&mdash;his eyes sparkled&mdash;"but I
saw the pearls were big." His tone was most persuasive. "You can
see I am not deceiving you, for the handwriting is a woman's, and
from the paper and ink you can tell it was written long ago. See
that crest at the top, too. She was a very rich woman no
doubt."</p>

<p>And Croupin was only speaking the truth here, for the paper
had come out of the family jewel case of the wealthy countess who
had died and bequeathed to him all her belongings.</p>

<p>The barber sat down again, and now accepting as truth all that
Croupin had told him, was in a very troubled frame of mind. It
was tormenting him that he could not have all the profit for
himself, but he saw that the Frenchman was adamant, and very
different now from the cringing and easily bullied creature who
had sold him the razors the previous day. Besides, he realised
that the deal was going to be too big for him to handle, and he
would have to call someone else in.</p>

<p>He thought first of Ah Chung, but told himself instantly that
it would never do to have dealings with him in a matter like
this, for being well acquainted with Ah Chung's methods, he was
not willing that only a knife thrust should stand between the
Chinaman and the acquisition of the whole of the booty. He knew
the customs of the Orientals upon the Causeway too well and would
not risk it.</p>

<p>The two sat on talking and arguing for a long time, and
customer after customer knocked unheeded upon the shop door.
Finally, they came to an arrangement. Voisin was to give Croupin
a receipt for the ring and the list of the jewellery, so that
there could be no double crossing on his part, and then the
Frenchman was to return to the barber's shop at 10 o'clock that
night, when Voisin swore with many oaths there would be good news
for him, and a way found to put him in possession of sufficient
funds to enable him to obtain the other jewels.</p>

<p>Chuckling to himself, Croupin left the barber's and made his
way to Aldgate, where he partook of a more or less satisfying hot
meal at a cook shop that was in keeping with his clothes. Then he
put in two hours at a picture show and, finally, at five minutes
past ten, was tapping on the barber's door.</p>

<p>It was opened with no delay by Voisin, who without a word led
him into the inner room and motioned him to a chair that Croupin
noticed at once was now in a different position to that it had
occupied before, upon both of the two occasions when he had been
there. It was now well away from the wall, and turned at an
angle, faced a door that he supposed must lead out into a
scullery or washhouse. This door was slightly ajar.</p>

<p>Croupin sniffed delicately at the air. "Good!" he thought,
"then if he doesn't shut that door I shall know I'm being
watched. I'm on show to see if I am dangerous. Some one has just
been in here who is a heavy smoker of cigars. I can smell his
clothes."</p>

<p>Croupin knew it was at considerable risk that he had taken on
the game he had, and he was very much on the alert for any
possible danger, but he comforted himself with the thought that
they would be reckoning him as much more valuable to them alive
than when dead. Also, he was assured by the feel of the small
automatic pistol that he was gripping with the hand that he held
in his pocket.</p>

<p>The barber seemed ill at ease and his eyes were in every
direction but that of Croupin. "That friend of mine, I have asked
to call will be here in a few minutes," he said, "but before he
comes I want to ask you some questions, quick," and then he
rapped out at once&mdash;"How long have you been in England,
Monsieur Nation?"</p>

<p>"Nine months," replied Croupin promptly. "I arrived in
January."</p>

<p>"But how did you get a passport," asked the barber sharply,
"if you had trouble with your police? You told me you had been in
prison a few times, for a little while."</p>

<p>Croupin winked his eye. "I had no passport," he said. "I did
not need one. I was cook on a boat from Bordeaux, and I deserted
at Falmouth, directly it got in."</p>

<p>The barber forced a sickly smile. "You are always ready with
your answers, Monsieur," he said, "and, if you are deceiving me,
no doubt you will be thinking yourself very clever." He turned
his back to Croupin and walked to the cupboard. "Well, I will get
you a glass of wine."</p>

<p>Croupin certainly did think himself clever and, now that the
man's back was turned, would greatly have liked to have indulged
in a good grin, but he remembered that half-opened door in front
of him, and accordingly kept his features in a thoughtful and
becoming gravity.</p>

<p>The barber was a long time getting down the bottle and drawing
the cork, and Croupin would have had ample time to have smiled
many times, but he continued to preserve a perfectly set face,
and then suddenly&mdash;the door that was ajar was pushed wide
open and a man stepped into the room.</p>

<p>Croupin's heart beat like a sledge hammer as he sprang
instantly to his feet, for as he had half hoped and half
expected, the man before him was the one who had been with Short
Alf that night when they had raided the safe. He pretended to
look very scared.</p>

<p>"Don't be upset, Mr. Nation," came a sharp voice, speaking in
English, "and you can leave that pistol alone that you've got in
your pocket. No one's going to do you any harm and I'm only going
to speak to you about that ring." He regarded Croupin very
sternly. "You speak English, don't you?"</p>

<p>Croupin appeared to have in some degree got over his fright.
"Yes, I speak it a leetel," he replied as if rather nervously,
"but I understand it a lot."</p>

<p>"And everything you have told Mr. Voisin is the exact truth?"
asked Guildford, for, of course, the new comer was he.</p>

<p>"Zat is quite right," nodded Croupin. "It is all true."</p>

<p>"Well, I must be certain about you," went on Guildford,
"before I attempt to do any business." He spoke sternly, as if he
were a judge addressing a prisoner. "Now you have been a chef at
the Semiris, you say? You are not just an ordinary cook on a
ship?"</p>

<p>"No! no!" expostulated Croupin. "I am a finished chef."</p>

<p>"Then tell me what flavourings you use for a Peach Melba?"
asked Guildford quickly.</p>

<p>Croupin showed his beautiful white teeth, "Maraschino,
vanilla, and raspberry," he replied promptly.</p>

<p>"And what's the name of the manager of the Semiris, then?"
asked Guildford.</p>

<p>"Emil Ashberg," was the reply. "He is an Austrian."</p>

<p>"And what's the name of the woman whose jewels you took?" was
the next question.</p>

<p>Instantly Croupin drew himself up, and shook his head. "I
shall not say," he replied firmly. "Zat is my secret." He threw
out his hands. "You run no risk. You buy ze ring for &pound;60,
zat you can sell again for &pound;200. You are quite safe. Zen I
get the ozer jewels and you make profit again, for I sell zem to
you."</p>

<p>Guildford regarded him stonily for a long moment and then he
turned round to the barber and said sharply, "Put on the wine,
Voisin, but I'll have brandy. I think it's all right to deal with
this man."</p>

<p>One o'clock was sounding when Croupin crept into the room
where Larose was sleeping, and awakening him, proceeded gleefully
to give a recital of all that had happened.</p>

<p>Directly he started upon his news, the expression of Larose
was one of triumph and delight, but then suddenly his face fell
and he interrupted sharply. "Great Jupiter!" he exclaimed, "but
they 'phoned me not half an hour ago, that the estate agent had
not set foot outside his house and that his light had just been
switched off." He shook his head angrily. "I shall have to see
into this myself."</p>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br>

THE TRAIL OF BLOOD.</h2>

<p class="first">ABOUT ten o'clock on the morning of the fifth
day after he had interviewed the enterprising Alexandre Nation in
the shop of Voisin, the barber, Guildford emerged from the street
door of the office of Edward Mason, estate agent, in no very
pleasant frame of mind.</p>

<p>He was furious with Sir Charles Carrion, for he had just been
reading in that morning's newspapers lurid and exciting accounts
of the extensive damage that had been done to the Albert Memorial
by the exploding of a bomb there late the previous night.</p>

<p>It was not for one moment that he regretted the damage that
had been done to the memorial, but it was in his mind that if the
mentally afflicted baronet continued to go planting bombs in
public places, sooner or later it was certain he would get
caught, and then&mdash;well, he, Guildford, did not like to
contemplate what would happen.</p>

<p>It was quite likely, he told himself, that once laid by the
heels, Sir Charles Carrion would not only boast openly of all his
exploits, but, glorying in everything that had been done, might
proceed at once to give chapter and verse about all the other
outrages, and perhaps, out of sheer devilry, disclose the
identities of all who had been associated with him. Such a
revelation would just appeal to the baronet's vicious and
distorted sense of humour, and it would delight him to know that
punishment was falling upon them all.</p>

<p>He left the office quite openly and strode resolutely along
towards the first bus-stop about a hundred yards away. He looked
straight before him, and no one would for one moment have
imagined from his demeanour that he had any thought of the
possibility of his being followed.</p>

<p>But had the truth been known, he was very much on the alert
for any such contingency and, always a cautious man when upon any
business he desired to keep secret, he was now intending to take
ample precautions there should be no trailing him.</p>

<p>Now whatever may be urged to the contrary, in a huge and
densely populated city like London it is absolutely impossible,
without definitely confirming his suspicions, to successfully
shadow an individual who suspects he is being watched.</p>

<p>To trail a man who has no idea that any one is after him may
be quite an easy matter, but to follow one who acts as if he
thought he were is quite a different matter.</p>

<p>And so it was that morning with Guildford.</p>

<p>A dozen of the best men of the Yard had been placed ready to
look out for him if he left his premises on any of the preceding
five days. They had all visited the estate office on one pretext
or another, and were quite familiar with his personality, and at
no hour of the twenty-four, they were sure, could he appear
either in the Mile End Road or in the street behind his office,
without at once being picked up.</p>

<p>But no one had ever been seen to be waiting outside his place
of business, and there had been no one even at the first bus stop
in either direction. In the first floor windows, however, of
houses near both of these stops, a man had sat all day and night
long, prepared to give a signal to a colleague 200 and more yards
away, and further away still, in both directions, a taxi had been
kept hovering about.</p>

<p>So when Guildford walked out of his office that morning and
picked up a bus going West, it happened he was the only one to
get in at the stop, and out of the tail of his eye he noticed
that fact. But he was not thereby in any way assured, and when at
the next stop two men mounted on to the footboard he eyed them
covertly, and was of opinion that both of them might be connected
with the police.</p>

<p>The bus proceeded down Whitechapel Road and stopped at
Aldgate. He made no movement to alight when it discharged some
other passengers, but just when it was on the move again, he
sprang suddenly from his seat as if it were from sheer
forgetfulness he had omitted to get out before, and jumped on to
the road. Then he turned round and stood watching deliberately to
see if any one were going to follow him.</p>

<p>The two men he had noticed cursed under their breaths, but
mindful of the strict orders they had received that on no account
were they to arouse any suspicion, continued to sit on where they
were, trusting that the two of their colleagues who were
following in a taxi would pick him up.</p>

<p>But the taxi had dawdled just a little too far behind the bus
and Guildford was able to dart in to Aldgate Station and snatch a
ticket from the automatic machine a good half minute before they
arrived. Then rushing down the stairs he caught a West-bound
train actually upon the move. So he was certain now that no one
had followed him.</p>

<p>He alighted at Cannon Street, and then after a sharp walk up
Gracechurch Street, and turning round twice in his tracks to make
sure he did not light upon the same people each time, he picked a
taxi off a rank and was driven to Oxford Circus.</p>

<p>There he went into a call office and ringing up the Semiris
Hotel, inquired if a French gentleman of the name of de Bearne
were staying there and received a reply in the affirmative.
Thereupon he asked to speak to him, but after holding on for a
couple of minutes or so whilst a search was being made in the
hotel, he was informed that the gentleman in question had gone
out. He said then that it did not matter and he would ring up
again. He did not leave any message or give his name.</p>

<p>"Well, he's staying there all right," he nodded to himself
when he was out in the street again, "and so it looks as if what
he told us were the truth. I expect now he'll soon be getting in
touch with Voisin again."</p>

<p>His next move was to call upon Sir Charles Carrion in Harley
Street, and, informing the nurse he had an appointment for eleven
o'clock, he was speedily ushered into the consulting room.</p>

<p>"My dear sir," exclaimed the surgeon loudly, and with a
beaming smile, directly he caught sight of him, "and how have you
been getting on." He made a motion in the direction of the couch.
"Just take off your clothes, will you, and I'll soon run you
over."</p>

<p>But there was no answering smile upon Guildford's face, and
directly the door was closed he asked scowlingly, "And that
tomfoolery last night was yours, of course?"</p>

<p>Sir Charles looked as happy as a child. "Sure," he replied
laughingly, "with my own hands I did it." He lowered his voice
impressively. "I waited a couple of hundred yards away, until I
saw the coast was all clear, then up I drove and jumped out of
the car. I put the bomb close up against the column, released the
catch, and then was off again in thirty seconds." He chuckled
with delight. "The thing exploded in just a minute, and although
I was a quarter of a mile away by then, the explosion shook my
very car. I was laughing so, I could hardly steer straight."</p>

<p>"It's darned tomfoolery, I say," swore Guildford angrily, "and
you are bound to get caught if you go on."</p>

<p>"And what does it matter if I am," replied Sir Charles, still
all smiles. "I know I haven't long to live with this cursed liver
of mine. I had a haemorrhage yesterday, and by rights ought to be
upon my back to-day." He lifted up his hand suddenly and gave a
low whistle of enlightenment. "Oh! I know what you are thinking
of&mdash;you believe I'd give you all away if I were caught?"</p>

<p>"There is no knowing what you'd do," growled Guildford. "I
tell you frankly, I'm afraid of you."</p>

<p>Sir Charles shook his head emphatically. "No, no, friend
Guildford," he said, "you needn't worry, for you'll be quite safe
there." He chuckled again. "I have no wish to step into eternity
with a scoundrel like Bascoigne, a common thief like yourself,
and a man like Libbeus, who has disgraced his profession."</p>

<p>"What about you?" sneered Guildford, stung to anger by his
contempt. "You're a credit to your calling, aren't you?"</p>

<p>The eyes of the baronet glinted in anger too. "But of one
thing you should be made aware, Mr. Sabine Guildford," he said
sternly, "and that is, I have never in any instance strayed from
the code of conventional morality to benefit myself." His voice
was firm and resonant. "Any wrongs that I may be judged to have
committed are not wrongs according to the code of morality I have
adopted for my own guidance." He nodded. "'An eye for an eye, and
a tooth for a tooth' is my motto, and as society has done unto
me, so am I now doing unto them." All his resentment seemed to
die down in a flash and he chuckled yet again. "No, I have never
sinned for cash."</p>

<p>"Well, I am of opinion it's devilish foolish your going on,"
insisted Guildford doggedly. "What good does it do, blowing up
monuments and damaging public buildings?"</p>

<p>Sir Charles shrugged his shoulders. "It pleases me," he
replied with a smile, "and surely you would not take pleasure
from a dying man." His eyes brightened again. "Why I am looking
forward with the eagerness of a child to that little business at
Rostrellor Court to-morrow night. It will be a sort of Punch and
Judy show to me, and carry me back to my boyhood's days." He
pulled open a drawer in the desk and abstracting a paper, handed
it across to Guildford. "Here you are. The whole programme cut
and dried. Just sit down and run through it."</p>

<p>With a scowl Guildford took the paper from him and then for a
few minutes there was silence in the room with Sir Charles
leaning back and closing his eyes as if he were very tired.</p>

<p>Presently Guildford spoke. "And exactly at a quarter-past
one," he said slowly, with his eyes fixed intently upon the
paper, "you will unlatch the front door and prop the mat up
against it to keep it from moving. We are to cross the hall and
go up the main staircase, and the room is the third upon the
left. There will be no fear of waking any one, because you will
see that both Lord and Lady Rostrellor are well drugged with
sleeping tablets, and besides Lord Rostrellor will probably be
three parts drunk. We may fined the safe unlocked, or in any
case, it is only an old-fashioned Weber and a Jemmy will open it
at once, or yet again, the jewellery may have been left upon the
dressing table, for they are very careless people." He looked up
and asked sharply. "Are you sure that the whole thing will be as
simple as that?"</p>

<p>"Quite," replied Sir Charles, opening his eyes wearily, "and
if it were not that for sentimental reasons I object, mine should
be the actual hands to rob my relatives, and I would hand you
over the jewels myself." Some energy came into his voice again.
"Oh! and if everything runs smoothly, you might look in the
drawing room before you go out. It is the second room on the
right, leading out of the hall and there is some valuable old
silver there. Snuffboxes and the like. You might take a few of
them, too."</p>

<p>"What about the telephone?" asked Guildford. "You'll put that
out of action, of course!"</p>

<p>"No," replied Sir Charles at once, "there are three or four
extensions in the house and I don't pretend to understand them,
so I won't risk being caught messing them about." He spoke
testily. "But you needn't worry there, man, for if you don't
bungle, nothing will be discovered until the morning. Every one
will be dead sleepy, for a lot of Rostrellor's old burgundy will
be drunk, and you can depend upon it that all the servants will
have had their whack of it, too."</p>

<p>"And I can find your Keston bungalow easily?" asked Guildford.
"There is no need to go down to-day?"</p>

<p>"None whatever," was the reply. "You can't mistake it. It is
the only residence by the lake-side and stands quite by itself.
Here are the two keys and you can run your car into the garage
without a soul being any the wiser."</p>

<p>"I'm only taking Voisin," said Guildford. "I can depend upon
him."</p>

<p>"I should think you could," commented Sir Charles. "He looks a
damned scoundrel to me and should be quite up to the game." He
laughed suddenly. "Oh! I met Mr. Bascoigne by chance in Bond
Street yesterday and we had a short chat together. He's got the
wind up properly and never moves a yard now without thinking he's
being followed. He says his place at Crowborough was burgled last
week and some one opened his safe."</p>

<p>"The devil!" ejaculated Guildford, choking back a grin. "Did
he lose much?"</p>

<p>"No, only a couple of &pound;5 notes," replied Sir Charles.
"But what frightens him is, a newspaper recording his trial was
taken from a drawer in his desk. He says the whole thing is very
mysterious, and he's got that snooker, Larose, now completely on
his mind. He says he can't understand it, for the servants found
a strange glove behind the settee in his study the next morning,
and marks on the wall as if someone had been hiding there."</p>

<p>Guildford's face fell. "When did it happen?" he asked quickly,
and certainly with no inclination to grin now.</p>

<p>"The night we were all at Ah Chung's," replied Sir Charles,
"and what happened, according to him, is undoubtedly most
strange. He went down two days after, and his butler met him with
a long tale about marks of mud in the hall, marks on the study
carpet that smelt of tobacco-juice, the front door or some window
having been opened in the night, because the hall was much colder
than it should have been, and that glove and those marks behind
the settee. Then he examined the contents of the safe and saw a
lot of documents there were not as he had left them, and those
two &pound;5 notes had gone. Finally, he found this newspaper had
been taken from his desk."</p>

<p>"And this glove behind the settee," asked Guildford sharply,
"what was it like?"</p>

<p>"An expensive Suede one that belonged to no one in the house,
and a man's glove undoubtedly." He looked quickly at his watch
and then rose at once to his feet. "But I'm sorry I can't give
you any more time now. I feel dreadfully ill, but I am still
going on with my work." He made a wry face. "I've not quite made
up my mind whether to die in harness or get blown up with the
next bomb."</p>

<p>Guildford was most uneasy during his journey back to Mile End
Road. The thought of that glove behind the settee and worse
still, that abstraction of the newspaper from the desk made him
feel sick with apprehension.</p>

<p>"But they are nothing to do with me," he consoled himself
finally, "and after this Rostrellor affair and I know for certain
about that stuff coming from the Semiris, I'll clear off quick
and lively. I've had enough of these mad fools."</p>

<p>Arriving back at his office, he had at once other things to
occupy his mind, for Voisin was waiting for him there, and
directly they were alone the barber rapped out. "That fellow
Nation's been in to see me this morning. He wants more money to
go on living at that hotel. He can't get into the room he wants
to, yet, and he's running short."</p>

<p>"But he had &pound;50!" exclaimed Guildford angrily. "What's
he done with it?"</p>

<p>"He says it nearly all went on his clothes and his luggage,"
replied Voisin, "and as he's a stranger to the management, he
says they may ask him for a deposit at any moment. He knows that
is the usual custom with people who haven't stayed there
before."</p>

<p>"Then how much does he want?" asked Guildford.</p>

<p>"Another &pound;50," was the reply with a grin. "He says his
suite of rooms is costing him &pound;4/4/ a day."</p>

<p>Guildford considered for a moment.</p>

<p>"Well, what does he look like now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A real swell," replied the barber with enthusiasm. "Very well
dressed and as good as anybody." He nodded his head emphatically.
"Yes, I'm sure he's been telling us the truth. He is not a common
thief and he's been in a big way. He has altered his face a lot
and wears a moustache now."</p>

<p>"Did he put any questions to you about me?" asked
Guildford.</p>

<p>The barber hesitated. "Yes and no," he replied. "He said at
once that he didn't expect I would tell him who you are or where
you live, but he seemed worried as to whether you could pay up
for those jewels when he got them. He expects some thousands of
pounds."</p>

<p>"Oh! he does, does he?" remarked Guildford drily. "Well, we'll
have to see about that."</p>

<p>"He wants that &pound;50 at once," went on the barber. "I'm to
'phone him up about it at the hotel. He's staying in until he
hears from me."</p>

<p>Again Guildford considered. "Do you think it is a plant to get
at me?" he asked with a frown. "You haven't been followed
here?"</p>

<p>"Not a chance," replied Voisin, grinning cunningly. "I went
out through the bird-shop and took great care." He shook his
head. "Besides, I'm sure the fellow is quite all right. I can
tell he's been in gaols in France, for he knows all the ways of
prisons"&mdash;he smiled grimly&mdash;"as well as I do."</p>

<p>"Well, ring him up," said Guildford after a pause, "and tell
him you'll have the money for him to-night at nine o'clock." He
frowned in annoyance. "But I'll have another talk with him first,
for I'm not going to part with the &pound;50 without good reason.
If he gets the stuff, there's no certainty he'll bring it to us."
He nodded. "Still you ring him up and tell him to come to your
place."</p>

<p><br>
A FEW minutes before nine that night the merry Monsieur Nation
was knocking at the barber's door. He had got the collar of his
coat well tucked up, and his hat was pulled down well over his
eyes. He was carrying with him a very carefully done-up small
parcel, which he explained to Voisin when he got inside was a
bottle of good brandy for a treat. He did not add, however, that
the surface of the bottle had been very delicately rubbed with a
piece of bacon rind in the expectation that he would get the
fingerprints of both the barber and Guildford before he left Rent
Street that night.</p>

<p>"And don't say I brought it, mon ami," he whispered
impressively when he learnt, as he had expected, that Guildford
was coming to bring the money, "or your rich friend will say that
no wonder my funds are getting low. It is good stuff. Here, hold
it up to the light and see the beautiful dark colour. No pale
brandies for me!" and so a couple of moments later the barber was
leaving generous greasy finger marks upon one of the beautifully
engraved cards of 'Monsieur Raoul de Berne, Avenue des Fleurs,
Chantilly.'</p>

<p>"That is the address I have ready," explained the lively
Croupin, as he carefully placed the greased card in the empty
side of his cigarette case. He chuckled. "I am prepared for
everything when I am playing for big stakes."</p>

<p>Guildford arrived almost at the stroke of nine, and noted with
silent approval the elegant appearance of the Frenchman, indeed,
being so impressed that all remaining tinges of suspicion that a
trap was being set by the police at once faded away.</p>

<p>"He is no police spy," he told himself. "This fine gentleman
here is a first-class Parisian thief, and he may be very useful
to me if I manage him properly."</p>

<p>"Well," he asked at once, "how is it that you want more
money?"</p>

<p>Croupin threw out his hands. "I am sorry, Monsieur," he said
in his melodious broken English, "but to stay at ze Semiris cost
lot of money, and I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you haven't paid anything there yet," broke in Guildford
sharply. "You say you have not paid them a penny."</p>

<p>"No, no," agreed Croupin instantly, "but ze fifty pounds have
nearly all gone on ze outfit. I had to have ze best of everysing,
or ze chamber maids vould talk. Silk shirts, silver-backed
brushes, good pyzamas, ze best of shoes." He nodded, "I buy zem
all second-hand, but I have not &pound;10 left, and if zey
suddenly ask me for money it would be bad."</p>

<p>"And when can you get at the things?" asked Guildford.</p>

<p>"On Monday," replied Croupin. "Zere is a man who has been ill
in ze room I must get into, and he nevaire leave it. But he is
much better, and go away Monday, and I have bespeak his room,
because of ze view." He nodded again. "On Tuesday I bring
everysing for you to buy."</p>

<p>"And how do I know that?" asked Guildford, eyeing him
intently. "You may take them somewhere else if once I part with
the &pound;50."</p>

<p>Croupin threw out his hands. "Bah! ze fifty pounds is small
trifle to me!" he exclaimed. "I tell you ze jewels vill fetch
great sum of money. No, you must trust me as I trusted Monsieur
Voisin when I gave him ze ring to show you, ze ozzer day."</p>

<p>"But he had given you a receipt for it," said Guildford.</p>

<p>Croupin laughed derisively. "And za vas of no good," he
replied, "for if he say I have not given him ze ring, zen off I
go to ze police and say, 'Look here, zat Voisin rob me of ring I
stole from someone else. Put him in ze prison at once.'" He
snapped his fingers together. "I should look a fool, should I
not?"</p>

<p>They argued on for a few minutes and finally Guildford paid
over the &pound;50.</p>

<p>"Bien!"' exclaimed Croupin, putting away the notes, "and now I
will drink to our healths in Monsieur Voisin's good brandy," and
holding the bottle by the neck he poured himself out a good nip
and drank it up.</p>

<p>A minute or so later and Guildford helped himself, too, then
he had hardly put down the bottle when Croupin almost thrust one
of the menu cards of the Semiris Hotel into his hand.</p>

<p>"See, Monsieur," he exclaimed, gleefully, "how I am living
now, and a week ago&mdash;" he laughed with great
enjoyment&mdash;"I was having my bed in filthy holes, and eating
ze food zat vas only good for pigs."</p>

<p>Guildford scanned down the card. "One guinea for your dinner
Mr. Nation!" he commented drily. "Yes you are certainly doing
yourself well!"</p>

<p><br>
THAT night Ah Chung said to his relation, Ho Ling&mdash;"That
Voisin will not be of use to us much more. He sold some razors to
me last week that he said had cost thirty shillings, and I found
to-day he had only paid six. I went into his room this morning
when he was away and read it in his book. He is methodical and
keeps good accounts. Besides, he is not with us now in other
ways. Yesterday he said his brother is sick in Birmingham, and
to-morrow he will tell me he goes to see him. But he is on other
business. He is lying to me."</p>

<p>"It is well, Ah Chung," replied his relation calmly. "To-day I
found three sacks in the street that had fallen from a dray. They
have no markings and do not come from here. They will serve when
the hour comes. This river never speaks."</p>

<p>"This morning he went out through next door," continued Ah
Chung, "and he looked many times along the street to see he was
not followed. He was away two hours. He is doing something and
will bring trouble upon us if we do not watch."</p>

<p>"I sigh for the country of our ancestors," said Ho Ling. "Will
it be long now, O Ah Chung, before it gives us greeting."</p>

<p>A long silence followed before the answer came. "No, it will
not be long Ho Ling," replied Ah Chung softly. "The morning will
soon come. Buy no more animals, for we shall not need them. I,
too, am lonely, and would wish to see our home."</p>

<p>The following morning, Larose, having informed the delighted
Croupin that he should probably not be wanting him for a couple
of days, and that, he could therefore take a holiday, proceed to
pay a visit to the finger-print department of Scotland Yard, with
the request that the clearly-defined finger-prints upon the two
cards that Croupin had obtained for him should be photographed,
and a search made to ascertain if they had any record of either
of them upon their files.</p>

<p>Returning two hours later he was thrilled almost beyond
expression to learn that although of one set of finger-prints the
department had no record, the other was that of a Sabine
Guildford, a one-time lawyer, who fourteen years previously had
been sentenced to five years' imprisonment for misappropriation
of moneys entrusted to his care.</p>

<p>He made no comment and gave no explanation, but next asked to
see the convict's photograph and the description of him that had
been filed at the time of his conviction.</p>

<p>He drew a deep breath of thankfulness as he gazed at the
photo. Allowing for the difference in age, there was not the
slightest doubt that the lawyer Guildford and the estate agent
Mason were the same man! The same forehead, the same firm jaw,
the same stern expression of the eyes!</p>

<p>He thanked the officials for their courtesy, and next
proceeded to the office of 'The Times,' in Printing House Square,
where, showing his badge, he asked to be allowed to go over the
files for November, 1915.</p>

<p>He soon came upon the report of the trial he wanted.</p>

<p>Sabine Guildford had been arraigned for employing &pound;3000
of a client's money in a private speculation, and had been tried
before a Mr. Justice Ames. For the moment Larose was very
disappointed at learning who the judge had been, but then
remembering that the murdered Samuel Wiggins had been living at
Leigh-on-Sea, his heart gave a big bound when he read that the
client who had been robbed, a widow of the name of Wiser, also
resided in that same town.</p>

<p>The trial had been very short, and, although Guildford had
admitted the offence, he had insisted vehemently that if the
arrest had been delayed for only three weeks, nothing would have
been heard of the matter, for the speculation he had entered
into, and which at first had seemed to be a disastrous one, had
righted itself suddenly and his client would be receiving back
her money in full.</p>

<p>But the Law Society, through the Prosecutor for the Crown, had
urged strenuously that in determining the sentence, the erring
lawyer should receive, no mitigation should be made because the
money had been recovered, and pleaded that an exemplary example
should be made. The Judge, thereupon, evidently agreeing with
them, had sentenced Guildford to five years' imprisonment with
hard labour.</p>

<p>The next move of Larose was to consult a post office directory
of the County of Essex, and he was delighted again to see that a
Mrs. Wiser was still living at Leigh-on-Sea. Resolving then to
advance his case as far as possible before he made any report to
the Chief Commissioner, half an hour later he was driving down to
that thriving resort at the mouth of the Thames.</p>

<p>He found Mrs. Wiser, an old lady well over seventy, without
any difficulty, but upon making known from where he came and that
he wanted to ask her about the trial of 15 years ago, was met
with an almost tearful refusal to discuss it in any way.</p>

<p>"I'm getting old," said Mrs. Wiser tremulously, "and it isn't
right for any one to come and worry me. I've not had a good
night's rest since that dreadful murder of my poor brother,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your brother!" ejaculated Larose in astonishment. "Then was
that Mr. Wiggins your brother?"</p>

<p>"Of course he was, and my only one, too," she replied with a
catch in her voice. "Didn't you know it? Why, he lived not three
minutes from here, just in that street round at the back, and
every day either he or his daughter used to come and see me."</p>

<p>Larose with difficulty suppressed his excitement, for in a
lightning flash the trail of the murderer of Samuel Wiggins was
uncovering itself before his eyes, the trail of Sabine Guildford
from the Gibbett Inn upon that Sunday of the dreadful compact to
the bloody knife-thrust inside that shelter upon the Esplanade
close by.</p>

<p>Then quickly overcoming the old lady's disinclination to
speak, by his gentle and sympathetic manner, he drew out by
tactful questioning all the main incidents that had led to her
one-time solicitor being placed in the dock.</p>

<p>Guildford had sold some property for her, and when she was
perfectly aware the sale had been effected, she could
nevertheless not get him to make a settlement. Apparently judging
her character well, and knowing she was not in any way a business
woman, he had kept putting her off, time after time, with one
excuse and another. But happening to want the money urgently for
a particular purpose, and beginning to get frightened, she had
finally gone to her brother, a tea-broker in Mincing Lane.</p>

<p>Mr. Wiggins's had been a very different character to hers, and
a sharp business man he had suspected something unusual
immediately. So taking his own lawyer with him, a man of high
standing on the executive of the Law Society, he had paid a
surprise visit to Guildford, and insisted that the money should
be paid over, without an hour's delay.</p>

<p>This, however, Guildford had been unable to do, and had
pleaded for further time, but both her brother and this other
lawyer had been adamant in their refusals to wait, and so
Guildford had been arrested and charged that same day.</p>

<p>"And who was this other lawyer who went with your brother?"
asked Larose, steadying his voice with an effort. "Do you
remember his name?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiser shook her head. "No," she replied sadly, "my
memory's getting very bad. But he was a friend of my brother,"
she added, "for Samuel called him Tony."</p>

<p>"Fate! Fate!" murmured Larose brokenly, "then they both died
by the same hand. Samuel Wiggins and Anthony Clutterbuck!"</p>

<p>His next visit was to the daughter of the dead Samuel Wiggins,
who was continuing to live on in the same house that she and her
father and their one maid had been occupying prior to the
dreadful tragedy that had overtaken them.</p>

<p>It was quite a good-class little house, standing in its own
garden, and it was one of the score and more of exactly similar
houses that stood in a road leading down to the sea. There were
no houses opposite, just unfenced grass-land, running up to a
road at a much higher level, in which the most conspicuous object
was a large hotel.</p>

<p>Miss Wiggins was an athletic type of woman about 30, and in a
wistful, but perfectly business-like way she answered all the
questions he put to her about her late father's daily life. Mr.
Wiggins, she told him, had of late been in the habit of going out
very little because he could not walk far on account of his
rheumatism; and he very seldom went out at night. When it was
fine and warm enough it was his custom to sit out nearly all day
long in the garden in front of the house.</p>

<p>"So it was only just by chance that he was killed," she
explained, "for he hadn't left the garden for three days before
that night. But the warm evening tempted him and he went down to
the Esplanade to watch the lights of the big steamers as they
passed out of the river." She nodded insistently. "And his
murderer must have been a madman, for poor father hadn't an enemy
in all the world. He was always so kind!"</p>

<p>"So that's that," remarked Larose very grimly, as he climbed
back into his car, "and as sure as my name's Gilbert Larose
there'll be an appointment one morning very shortly for Messrs.
Bascoigne and Guildford to meet some chaplain at the early hour
of 8 o'clock."</p>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.<br>

"THE BURGLARY AT ROSTRELLOR COURT."</h2>

<p class="first">IN the meantime the elegant Monsieur Choisy-Hautville had been enjoying what he was certain was one of the
most thrilling days of his life, for he had been burning incense
before the shrine of beauty, and the lights upon the altar there
were the flower-blue eyes of the pretty Angela Lendon.</p>

<p>Now it is one of the great mysteries of life why perfectly
sane and well-balanced individuals should suddenly one day come
to conceive that some number of the opposite sex fulfils all the
requirements of absolute perfection and delight.</p>

<p>The conception may come to those even with wide experience of
the world, who hold most treasured memories of many adorations,
and who have bent to the winds of unnumbered loves and
passions.</p>

<p>It is a form of madness, defying reason and quite incapable of
analysis.</p>

<p>And so it was with Raphael Croupin now that he had met Angela
Lendon.</p>

<p>He had become hopelessly in love with her from the very first,
to the extent of worship almost completely taking the place of
passion.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was, he told himself, because she was so different
to all he had been himself. He was soiled and tarnished and had
drunk of many a forbidden cup, regarding love as a flower that
faded soon and should be changed often.</p>

<p>But with her the serenity and purity of her mind were
reflected in her face. Certainly, he thought, as yet she had only
dreamed of love, and when she awoke to its pains and ecstasies
the recipient of her favours would be among the most transfigured
beings upon the earth.</p>

<p>Now, of course, in all these rhapsodies the ardent Frenchman
was placing the pretty Angela very much upon a pedestal. She was
only just an ordinary nice girl, who had been brought up very
quietly, and, as a by no means well-to-do clergyman's daughter,
had had very little chance of seeing the world.</p>

<p>She had had her flirtations, however, and was by no means
averse to being made love to. Her Madonna-like face she had
inherited from her mother, who had had seven children, and like
that deceased lady, she, too, would most probably carry her
virginal expression well into married life and with three or four
children about her knees.</p>

<p>She had often thought of marriage and looked forward to it,
but whilst she had determined she would never enter its holy
state without being really in love she was always hopping that
when Prince Charming did appear he would not be too badly endowed
with this world's goods. She was quite a far-seeing and business-like young woman, and did not forget the pinched and hard-scraping times of her girlhood in the ill-furnished vicarage near
Canterbury.</p>

<p>So, when the handsome Frenchman had sat opposite to her at
lunch that day and had fixed her with his dark impelling eyes,
and she had noticed his general elegance and his big emerald
ring, her heart had begun to flutter, and she had thought that
perhaps her dreams were now in a way of becoming true.</p>

<p>Then when they had gone into the music room and he was playing
upon the harpsichord, she had noticed his eyes wandering all over
her and had felt quite certain that he was admiring her.</p>

<p>That night, too, she had dreamed that he had kissed her and
the memory of that kiss had set the seal upon her determination
to encourage him in every way she could.</p>

<p>Her godmother had told her laughingly that she had seen how
interested he had been in her and accordingly had made discreet
inquiries about him from Gilbert Larose, and learnt that he was
unmarried, of a very nice disposition, and, moreover, had
recently come into a large fortune from a distant relation.</p>

<p>"Not that it was really necessary to make any inquiries about
his character," she explained, "for when Mr. Larose told me they
were old friends I knew that was quite sufficient. Helen Ardane
is much too particular a woman to have married any one who likes
any but nice people."</p>

<p>So things had been up to the morning following the day when
Croupin had lunched with them, but then day after day passing
without the Frenchman having rung up, as he had said he would,
the girl had become very disappointed, although not for one
moment would she allow any one to see it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fox-Drummond was disappointed, too, for the London family
had been left badly off, and a born intriguer, she was hoping to
make a good match for Angela. Besides, apart from any question of
means, she herself had taken a great liking to the Frenchman, and
considering herself a good judge of character, was quite sure he
would be kind to any girl he married.</p>

<p>But when just a week had gone by an explanation of Croupin's
silence was suddenly forthcoming, for Mrs. Fox-Drummond was
called to the telephone from the breakfast table to hear the
melodious voice of Monsieur de Choisy-Hautville asking if he
might come down and see them that morning.</p>

<p>He had had to go away, he said, on very urgent business, but
that he would explain when he saw them. He was bringing down some
harpsichord music, he added, and would like to give Miss Lendon a
lesson upon the instrument.</p>

<p>"But what a pity we are going to that tiresome dinner at Lady
Rostrellor's to-night," said Mrs. Fox-Drummond when she had
imparted the news to the mildly blushing Angela, "or he could
have stayed the whole day." She nodded. "Still, we need not leave
here until after four o'clock."</p>

<p>The girl was in the garden when Croupin drove in through the
gates, and she coloured becomingly as he sprang out of his car
and came towards her.</p>

<p>"And did you wonder what had become of me?" he asked, holding
her hand just long enough to let her know that his greeting was
not an ordinary one.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, no," she laughed. "I haven't thought of you,
have I?"</p>

<p>"But yes, I hope so," he laughed back happily, with sufficient
knowledge of the ways of women to be aware that this would be the
very sort of answer to expect from one who had been thinking
quite a lot about him. He pretended to look very sad. "I should
be grieved indeed if you had forgotten me."</p>

<p>"I hadn't forgotten you, of course," she replied archly; she
now pretended to look stern, "or that you had said you were going
to ring up soon."</p>

<p>Croupin put his finger to his lips and looked very mysterious.
"Hush!" he whispered softly. "I have been away on a great
adventure. One day I will tell you all, but I cannot now, for it
is a secret between me and Mr. Larose." His face brightened. "But
now I must see Mrs. Fox-Drummond at once. It is a lovely morning,
and I want to know if I can take you for a drive."</p>

<p>She laughed merrily. "You needn't see her for that," she said,
"for it is I who have to decide." She nodded. "Yes, I should like
to come. Where shall we go?"</p>

<p>"I thought of Haslemere," he replied. "It is one of the most
lovely spots of your beautiful country."</p>

<p>They went into the house for Angela to get ready and Mrs. Fox-Drummond at once invited Croupin to lunch. "But not a minute
later than one," she added, "for this afternoon we are off to
stay for two days with Lady Rostrellor at Rostrellor Court.
There's a dinner party to-night and a ball tomorrow." She made a
faint grimace. "It is a duty visit, for Lady Rostrellor is my
aunt."</p>

<p>Croupin enjoyed the drive immensely, but with every minute
fell deeper and deeper in the toils. Angela was not a bit shy,
and while obviously desirous of pleasing, yet checked with
laughing mockery any approach to tenderness on his part. Perhaps
her instinct told her that the strongest chain to bind him to her
would be forged by grudging and reluctant favours.</p>

<p>They returned home just before one, and were met in the hall
by a very animated Mrs. Fox-Drummond.</p>

<p>"Oh! Monsieur de Choisy-Hautville," she exclaimed, "but are
you free until to-morrow morning?"</p>

<p>Croupin did not appear to quite understand what she meant.
"Free! Why I am always free!" he laughed. He suddenly remembered
Larose and corrected himself quickly. "I mean I have nothing to
do to-day or to-night. To-morrow"&mdash;he shrugged his
shoulders&mdash;"I may have to help with Mr. Larose again, but
why do you ask?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Fox-Drummond explained quickly. Her cousin, Mr. Fairfax,
had been coming with them to Rostrellor Court, but less than an
hour ago he had telephoned that he had suddenly found he had to
make a journey to the north of England and could not possibly put
it off. Manlike then, he had left it to her to make his apologies
to Lady Rostrellor, and in great embarrassment she had rung up
her godmother and told her of his defection at the eleventh
hour.</p>

<p>Lady Rostrellor had been in despair, for the absence of one
man she had averred, would ruin the harmony of the whole dinner
party. It would make an uneven number of guests and one lady
would have to go in alone.</p>

<p>"So she insisted," went on Mrs. Fox-Drummond plaintively,
"that I must find the substitute myself, and bring him along with
us this afternoon." She looked imploringly at Croupin. "Now, will
you come, Monsieur de Choisy-Hautville? It will be such a
kindness if you will oblige me. You will be stopping the night
there for it is a house-party as well as a dinner one."</p>

<p>Croupin gave a side-glance at Angela, who was smiling
expectantly. "Certainly, I will," he replied gallantly, "I shall
be most delighted"&mdash;he drew attention to his morning
clothes&mdash;"but, of course, I shall have to go up to town and
get my things."</p>

<p>And so it came about that that night Croupin found himself
seated in the immense dining room of Rostrellor Court among the
many distinguished and aristocratic guests that were assembled
there. But they were nearly all old or elderly, he noted,
although the women were most expensively gowned, and the display
of jewels was magnificent.</p>

<p>"Oh! Raphael, Raphael," he murmured, "it is a good thing you
are above temptation now, for what a haul you could have made
here!" He grimaced to himself. "But what a waste of beautiful
things! These wrinkled and yellow skins are no proper background
for jewels of beauty such as these! Why don't they give them to
their children to wear." He grinned. "But perhaps they haven't
had any."</p>

<p>The dinner was an excellent one, and the wines were the
choicest that could have been laid down. Angela was seated on the
other side of the table, and every now and again she flashed him
a delicious look that quite took away the taste of everything he
had got in his mouth at the moment.</p>

<p>There were 23 other diners and he had been introduced to a
number of them before dinner, the lady who had been allotted to
him&mdash;an angular and middle-aged Miss Drake-Raven, the
daughter of the white-haired Bishop of Melton Mowbray, who was
sitting not far away, proved most willing to supplement the
introductions by providing details about everybody present.</p>

<p>She had a rather bitter and sarcastic tongue and was evidently
delighted to meet some one, who as far as the present company was
concerned, was of an innocent and virgin state of mind.</p>

<p>"Yes, this is quite a family party," she explained, "and we
are nearly all related or connected by marriage to one another.
That is the Dowager Lady Wortleberry over there, whose book of
reminiscences last year made so many people furious. Dear old
thing! She has such a dreadful memory. She never forgets
anything. Of course, she didn't always mention names, but then
everyone knew whom she meant. She was a very beautiful girl once.
Tall and slim as a willow, they say."</p>

<p>Croupin regarded the almost dwarf-like lady she indicated,
upon whose wizened bosom dangled an exquisite diamond pendant,
and wondered with a pang if Angela would ever become a
monstrosity like that.</p>

<p>"And that is Lord Wistleton of Hull," went on his informant,
inclining her head towards a huge-chested individual with a big
leonine head, who was imbibing long draughts of the classic
Rostrellor burgundy as if it were so much diluted milk, "a very
capable man, and ought to have been Prime Minister years ago."
She nodded. "And he would have been, too, if he had not been
married twice."</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" ejaculated Croupin, "then does a second
marriage debar you from high political honours in this
country?"</p>

<p>"It does," replied Miss Drake-Raven emphatically, "when it so
happens"&mdash;she lowered her eyes with becoming
modesty&mdash;"that your first wife is still living and has
divorced you."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" exclaimed Croupin, wondering incredulously what
possible physical attraction that leviathan body could have had
for any member of the opposite sex. "He is a gay gentleman is
he?"</p>

<p>"Most fascinating," commented Miss Drake-Raven with
enthusiasm, "and when he is addressing any large audience he has
a voice like a vesper bell." She continued. "And that's Sir
Charles Carrion, the one who looks so ill. He is a very great
surgeon, besides being the eleventh baronet of his line." She
shook her head frowningly. "But he is very eccentric and
disparages his own class and the nobility in a perfectly
disgraceful way. Lady Rostrellor is always terrified at what he
may be going to say."</p>

<p>"And who is that fine looking old gentleman with the long
white moustache?" asked Croupin. "He looks a soldier to me."</p>

<p>"He is," was the instant reply, "and a very distinguished one,
too. He's General Sir Pentlebury Lesage, and they say he's got
enough medals to go twice round his chest if he put them all on
at once. Of course he's getting old now, but he's still very
wonderful." She lowered her voice again. "Why, he'll drink three
bottles of that heavy burgundy to-night, and yet be eating a
large breakfast of bacon and eggs to-morrow."</p>

<p>Just at that moment the object of their regard looked in their
direction, and catching Croupin's eye, boomed in a deep voice in
the lull of the general conversation&mdash;</p>

<p>"de Choisy-Hautville, I think I caught your name, sir," and
when Croupin bowed, he went on, "Well, nearly thirty years ago I
remember a very charming girl in Tours of that name, Madelaine de
Choisy-Hautville I think she was!"</p>

<p>Croupin was about to admit she was his mother, when some
lightning flash of prudence stilled his tongue, and General
Lesage went on. "I heard she afterwards married the Conte de
Laine Croupin, and her son was that merry rascal, Raphael."</p>

<p>All eyes were turned at once on Croupin, and on the instant he
realised his danger, for he had of course told Angela his own
Christian name was Raphael. His knees trembled together, and his
mouth grew dry, but his natural delight in being in dangerous
situations heartened him, and in a lightning flash his sword was
out, and he was defending himself in the boldest way
possible.</p>

<p>"A distant relation of mine," he commented smilingly, and with
no trace of embarrassment, "and we were both born in Tourain." He
seemed very amused. "We have the same Christian names, too, for I
was baptised Raphael."</p>

<p>The old General reddened and coughed apologetically.
"Well&mdash;well, when I said he was a rascal," he began, "I only
meant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he is a rascal," broke in Croupin, laughingly, "or,
rather, I should say he was one, for he's supposed to have
reformed now, and be leading quite a respectable life."</p>

<p>"Oh! but do tell me in what way he was a rascal, Monsieur?"
broke in old Lady Wortleberry in a thin quavering voice. "I do so
like to hear about bad people. They are much more interesting
than the good ones." Her old eyes twinkled maliciously. "The Lord
Bishop here bores me to death."</p>

<p>A ripple of delighted laughter ran round the table, in which
the white haired Bishop of Melton Mowbray joined as heartily as
any one. Croupin was still the cynosure of all eyes.</p>

<p>"But what did your cousin do?" squeaked Lady Wortleberry. "Did
he murder any one?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no. No crimes of violence," smiled Croupin. "Just some
little matters of taking things that belonged to other people."
He lowered his voice dramatically. "It is supposed that it was he
who took that Michaelangelo when it was stolen from the Louvre
last year, and sold it afterwards to a millionaire in America,
who gave him &pound;40,000 for it. At any rate, that same month
an anonymous donor presented &pound;40,000 to the French
Government for the hospitals of Paris."</p>

<p>"Bravo! bravo!" called out Sir Charles Carrion
enthusiastically. "A fine fellow and I should like to shake him
by the hand. I remember all about him now. It was he, too, who
took the Duchess of Parterre's diamonds and then gave a great
banquet to the poor." He looked round challengingly at the
company. "We want men like him over here. The selfish rich have
no thought for the privations of their less fortunate fellowmen."
He pointed to the half-filled wineglass at his side. "Why the
price of one bottle of this burgundy we are all drinking now
would provide beer enough to inebriate a dozen honest navvies and
give them for a few hours a respite from the monotony of life. I
am of opinion&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Charles," interrupted Lady Rostrellor sharply.
"You've always been the black sheep of the family, and no one's
interested in anything you say."</p>

<p>"Oh! aren't they?" scoffed Sir Charles in unpleasant
amusement. "Well, I was talking for half an hour in the lounge
with Lady Wortleberry just before dinner, telling her everything
I could remember about you all during the last thirty years, and
she's going to put it in her next book." He smiled vindictively.
"Aren't you, my lady."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," squeaked the old dowager again. She spoke
thoughtfully. "It mayn't be all true, but"&mdash;she nodded
vigorously&mdash;"it'll make good copy."</p>

<p>The dinner came to an end at last, and then after a couple of
uninteresting hands at bridge Croupin managed to get Angela
Lendon to himself.</p>

<p>"Let's go into the conservatory," he whispered. "It'll be much
nicer there, and we can have a little talk."</p>

<p>"Well, we must not be very long," she replied, as she went
quickly with him through the lounge. "We are all supposed to go
to bed early tonight, because to-morrow the dancing will go on
until three or four o'clock."</p>

<p>They found a secluded spot at the end of the conservatory and
there, behind a big palm, seated themselves in a comfortable and
well-cushioned settee. There were no lights in the conservatory,
but it was a moonlit, though cloudy night, and the lights, too,
shone in through from the windows of the drawing-room behind.</p>

<p>There was silence for a few moments after they had settled
themselves down and then the girl said softly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell me about your relation, Monsieur, this other Raphael. I
am very interested in him." She hesitated a moment. "Is he a very
bad man?"</p>

<p>"The devil!" thought Croupin. "I may bluff a whole mob, but
this child here will not be so easy to deceive." He laughed
lightly. "No, Mademoiselle, he was never very bad, just
adventurous, and his adventures took the form of avenging himself
upon society for a great wrong that had once been done him." His
voice hardened. "When he was quite young, he was thrown into
prison for taking some jewels he had never touched. Then when he
came out, he was bitter and set himself to punish that world that
had punished him. He never robbed the poor, but made the very
rich his target, and the more closely their possessions were
guarded the more delighted was he to try to obtain them."</p>

<p>"But wasn't he caught and put into prison again?" asked
Angela.</p>

<p>"No," chuckled Croupin, "for they could never prove that it
was he. They thought it was, and in the end every robbery that
was committed was supposed to be his. It became at last the joke
of France, and when anything was stolen anywhere the people would
say, 'See, it's that Croupin again.'"</p>

<p>"But it wasn't right," said the girl thoughtfully. "He was a
thief."</p>

<p>"Of course he was," admitted Croupin sadly. His face
brightened. "But so much of it was pure devilry." He chuckled
again. "Once he stole a magnificent diamond necklace from a great
lady. She was hard and miserly and was worth millions, but kept
everything she had for herself. Then a few days after the robbery
a number of her poor relations each received an anonymous gift of
a beautiful big diamond, which they were able to sell for
thousands and thousands of francs. She was furious and said the
diamonds were hers"&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"but
she could not prove it and there the matter ended. It was a great
joke."</p>

<p>"And what was your relation's occupation, Monsieur?" asked
Angela. "How did he earn his living?"</p>

<p>"He taught music, Mademoiselle," replied Croupin, "and as a
great musician was always in request to play at the nuptial
masses when the rich society people were being married."</p>

<p>"And where is he now?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>Croupin swore softly under his breath at her persistence. He
shrugged his shoulders. "Who knows, Mademoiselle? He had an
inheritance left him, just as I did, and he has disappeared." He
sighed. "He may have gone into a monastery."</p>

<p>The conversation drifted off into other ways, and she told him
of her own life, of her two brothers and four sisters, of whom
she was the youngest, and of her quiet upbringing at the old
rectory! How her visits to her godmother had been the only peeps
into society she had had, how she was never going to marry, but
was intending shortly to start training for a nurse.</p>

<p>Croupin listened quietly and was more assured than ever that
at last he had come upon the dream woman of his life.</p>

<p>They talked on, quite oblivious of the flight of time, until
suddenly the lights behind them went out and they were plunged in
darkness, except for the moon which was now partly obscured by a
cloud.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed the girl looking hurriedly at her
watch, "it's a quarter to one. They have all gone to bed and we
must go, too, at once."</p>

<p>"No, wait just a minute or two," urged Croupin, laying a
light, restraining hand upon her arm. "Then no one will see you
go up, and for a few moments we can watch those stars." His voice
was low and tremulous. "See, how wonderful they are, watching
over the sleeping world."</p>

<p>The girl hesitated, but then glancing to where he indicated
she sighed deeply and settled herself back again among the
cushions. Her conscience bade her go, but the touch of his hand
had thrilled her, and the opiate loveliness of the hour held her
in its spell. The mystery of life, the mystery of youth, and the
mystery of love! That eternal trinity whose secrets will be never
told.</p>

<p>Minute after minute passed in complete silence and then just
when another cloud was about to cover over the moon they heard
the sound of stealthy footsteps at the other end of the
conservatory, and turning wide-eyed in consternation, saw a long
white hand part the leaves of a big palm-tree there. The owner of
the hand was in the shadows and beyond their view.</p>

<p>The girl made a convulsive clutch at Croupin's hand, and then
instantly they both bent their bodies down.</p>

<p>"We shan't be noticed," whispered Croupin. "We're in the
shadows, too. Keep still. Don't move," and he turned his own hand
round so that their fingers met and the clasp was mutual now. He
pressed her hand gently.</p>

<p>A minute and longer went slowly by. The strange hand did not
move and in their imagination only could they picture the peering
face behind.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the moon was blotted out and the whole place was
plunged at once in complete darkness. Croupin could feel that
Angela was trembling and so he drew her closer to him.</p>

<p>"Oh! How awful if we were seen!" she breathed in the very
faintest of whispers. "Do you think whoever it is will go away
soon?"</p>

<p>"Of course he will," breathed back Croupin reassuringly, and
then as his face touched hers as he had leaned so close to
answer, their lips met, too, and he kissed her.</p>

<p>"It wasn't fair to do that," she whispered as she shook her
head free, but Croupin had no fear that he had offended her,
because she made no attempt to withdraw her hand.</p>

<p>Three or four minutes passed, with the long conservatory as
dark and silent as the grave. Then the moon came out again and to
their great thankfulness the leaves of the palm were no longer
parted, and the hand could be no longer seen.</p>

<p>"Quick!" exclaimed Angela breathlessly, as she rose to her
feet, "and pray Heaven we meet nobody."</p>

<p>With the moon only to light them they darted through the
deserted dining-room into the hall, encountering no one upon
their way and then the girl paused for one moment at the foot of
the stairs.</p>

<p>"Good night, Monsieur," she whispered, "You are a bad man and
as wicked as the other Raphael." She nodded vigorously. "One
thing, I'll never be in the dark with you again."</p>

<p>"Oh! won't you, my little one," whispered back Croupin
tenderly. "If it is for me to decide, you will pass unnumbered
hours&mdash;" but she had tripped up the stairs and afraid to
raise his voice, he left the sentence unfinished. "Now, I'll wait
two minutes before I go up myself," he murmured. "It is a mercy
we have not been seen or heard by any one."</p>

<p>But he was quite mistaken there, for at that very moment one
of the under-footmen was standing in the shadows at the back of
the hall and watching him.</p>

<p>The man had been sent by the butler to obtain a pack of cards
from her ladyship's boudoir, and he had arrived in the hall just
in time to see Croupin speaking to some one. He did not, however,
see whom the Frenchman was addressing, because the stairs hid the
second party from view. He was too far away, also, to hear
anything that was being said.</p>

<p>Thinking little of the matter, but not wishing that he himself
should be seen, he waited until Croupin had leisurely ascended
the stairs, and then fulfilling his mission, returned to the
butler's room upstairs, where over a steaming brew of Lord
Rostrellor's old brandy the men-servants of the court were now
preparing to round off the night with a couple of hands at
bridge.</p>

<p>Then it would have appeared to any one watching outside that
the great mansion of the Rostrellors was at last sunk in slumber.
Its long and massive frontage was dark as if it were untenanted,
the lights had died down in its many scores of windows, and it
stretched desolate and ghostly under the faints rays of the
moon.</p>

<p>The clock in the big hall chimed the quarter, and almost as if
they had heard it and were waiting for the signal two figures
glided out of the trees and quickly crossing the stretch of
beautifully-kept lawn, tip-toed up to the front door.</p>

<p>They were Guildford and Voisin.</p>

<p>"It's open," whispered Guildford as it yielded to the touch of
his hand, and in five seconds they were inside the hall and the
door was being propped to again with the mat.</p>

<p>Then for a long minute they stood like graven images, making
no movement and no sound, and accustoming their eyes to the
gloom. The interior of the hall was illuminated faintly by the
moonlight that crept through the uncurtained tops of some of the
big windows.</p>

<p>"There is the staircase," whispered Guildford, "and you'll
wait at the bottom." His voice was menacing in its anxiety.
"Listen for every sound, and if you hear the slightest thing that
is suspicious, don't lose your head, but come and warn me at
once. Remember, I shall be in the third room on the left at the
top of the stairs, and I shall leave the door open. If I want you
I'll flash my torch and then you come up at once."</p>

<p>And just at that moment the four servants upstairs were
cutting for deal.</p>

<p>Guildford mounted the stairs as noiselessly as a cat, but with
his heart thumping hard. He tiptoed to the door of Lord and Lady
Rostrellor's bedroom, and very, very softly turned the
handle.</p>

<p>The door yielded at once, and he entered the room. It was a
very large room, and the historic Rostrellor bed was in like
proportion, being a huge four-poster with a great sagging canopy
overhead. Both the lord and his lady were fast asleep. He was
snoring stertorously, and she was joining in, in an asthmatic
wheeze. A good fire had been burning, and its dying embers still
illuminated the room. A small safe stood in the far corner.</p>

<p>Guildford crept up to the dressing table and with a sigh of
intense satisfaction picked up a handful of rings and thrust them
into his pocket. Then he advanced towards the safe, and at once
he frowned. The safe was locked and the key was not visible. He
considered for a moment and then tiptoed up to the bed. Then,
holding his breath in his excitement, he very gently began to
push his hand under Lady Rostrellor's pillow until, very
gradually and with infinite precaution, he had thrust it along
its entire length. The old lady felt his arm there and as if
annoyed at being disturbed, grimaced irritably, but she did not
open her eyes, and continued to wheeze on.</p>

<p>Then Guildford's frown deepened, for he had found nothing
there.</p>

<p>He glided back to the dressing table and flashing a little
torch, swept it round, but he still came upon no key. Then his
eyes glinted and his hand darted forward, as he noticed that a
big cold cream jar there was standing unevenly, with one side
higher than the other. He snatched it up and then, with a gesture
of contempt, picked up a small key from underneath.</p>

<p>And at that very moment the four men upstairs, after three
misdeals, had found that there was two cards missing, and the
young footman was being sworn at and told to go down and get
another pack.</p>

<p>With success so near now, Guildford's movements were like
lightning. The safe was opened in a trice and jewel case after
jewel case was emptied and their contents thrust into his
pockets.</p>

<p>Diamonds, emeralds, pearls, a necklace alone worth thousands
of pounds! His eyes burned like red-hot coals! It was a
fortune!</p>

<p>Quickly replacing each jewel-case back into the safe, he
locked it and with a sardonic smile restored the key to its place
under the cold-cream jar, then&mdash;his blood froze in horror,
for a resounding yell came up from the hall below.</p>

<p>"Help, help," roared a lusty voice. "Help, quick, there are
burglars here," and oaths and bumps and sounds of a fierce
struggle came up upon the air.</p>

<p>Guildford ejaculated one furious curse and then sprang into
action. He was out of the bedroom, along the corridor, and down
the stairs with the speed of a greyhound, to find Voisin prone
upon his back in the hall, with the young footman holding him
down and pummelling him violently.</p>

<p>Guildford, coming up behind, swung his right arm in a fearful
blow at the side of the footman's head, and the latter rolled
over like a stunned ox. Then he jerked Voisin to his feet. "Come
on now, you idiot," he panted. "Why didn't you see him in time?"
and cursing furiously, he proceeded to drag the tottering and
half-dazed barber towards the hall door.</p>

<p>But long before they could reach it, with a sickening feeling
in his stomach he realised that it would be only with great good
fortune now, that they would get away unhindered, for the butler
and the two other footmen came tearing through the hall, shouting
loudly and calling for help from those upstairs.</p>

<p>Guildford turned savagely, and faced them like a snarling
beast of the jungle.</p>

<p>"Keep back, you fools," he shouted, "or you're dead men all of
you," and snatching an automatic from his hip-pocket, he pointed
it menacingly at them.</p>

<p>The butler was elderly and married, and stopped dead in his
tracks, so did one of the footmen, but the other, who had served
in the Great War, continued to rush forward as if he had not
heard the warning.</p>

<p>Guildford's face was of an ashen colour, but he smiled a
dreadful smile, and waiting until the man was within five paces
of him, deliberately pulled the trigger and shot him through the
heart.</p>

<p>Gasps of horror came from the other two as their fellow-servant crashed on to the floor, and taking advantage of their
consternation, Guildford, still, however, having to drag Voisin
along with him, passed through the front door and banged it
behind him.</p>

<p>Then commenced an agonising journey for the two malefactors,
Guildford in an agony of mind, and Voisin in an agony of body. In
the struggle at the foot of the stairs, the barber had received a
violent blow in the stomach, and in addition to that, one of his
legs had been twisted and bent back under him. His face was
corpse-like in its whiteness and covered in profuse sweat.</p>

<p>"I can't walk," he wailed, "I can't go on."</p>

<p>"You'll have to," snarled Guildford. "Pull yourself together,
like a man. It'll mean a life sentence if they get you." Then
seeing that Voisin was tottering and actually about to fall, with
a savage curse he bent down and tugging him on to his shoulder,
with staggering and unsteady steps made for the trees upon the
other side of the lawn.</p>

<p>He gained the shelter of the trees and then bumped Voisin
roughly down.</p>

<p>"Come on now by yourself," he panted to the barber who seemed
only just able to stand. "We must run for it, and I can't carry
you any farther."</p>

<p>Then all suddenly he fell headlong over Guildford's dragging
arm, and tumbling to the ground almost brought him down with him.
He had at last fainted right away.</p>

<p>Guildford's breath came in quick, spasmodic gasps, and for the
moment he was bereft of oaths in his dismay. They were not a
quarter of a mile from the Court, and had yet nearly a mile and a
half to go before they would be in hiding, and&mdash;he had now
an inert man of 160 odd pounds to drag behind him.</p>

<p>His fury blazed up again, and he bent down and shook viciously
at the barber. "Wake up, you cursed idiot. I am not going to
swing for you." Then as there was not the slightest response to
all his shaking, he straightened himself up with a quick decisive
movement, and glaring round intently in every direction, began
muttering deeply. His mouth had become very dry, and he moistened
his lips shakingly with his tongue.</p>

<p>A dense black cloud was about to impinge itself upon the
moon.</p>

<p>He was standing in the corner of a large field, and there was
a plantation of small trees just behind him. A tall hedge lay to
one side, and a shallow muddy ditch upon the other.</p>

<p>His breath was now as laboured as if he were in the act of
running. He gave another intent glance round, and then knelt down
by the barber's side.</p>

<p>Some six or seven minutes later the moon had emerged again,
and it shone upon Guildford, who was now half a mile and more
away from the spot where he had been when it had gone in.</p>

<p>He was alone and running swiftly towards the most dangerous
point in his journey, where he would have to cross over the
Keston Road in full sight of anyone who might be watching from
the upper windows of either of the two houses there.</p>

<p>The contents of all Voisin's pockets, including a packet of
black-tobaccoed cigarettes, were now in his own, but that would
be of no interest to their late possessor, for the barber of Rent
Street would never smoke again.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the happenings had been so tragic that for
the moment everyone at Rostrellor Court seemed to have lost their
heads, and Pandemonium raged. Doors had been opened noisily,
there had been loud shoutings for explanation, people had come
tearing down the stairs, the lights had been switched on
everywhere, and a rush had been made to render first aid to the
injured footmen.</p>

<p>But it was found at once that the elder one was beyond all
help, and Sir Charles Carrion pronounced solemnly that his death
must have been instantaneous for he had been shot through the
heart. The other footman, after a quick examination, appeared not
to have been much hurt, and Sir Charles said he would probably be
conscious again in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Then the butler gasped out what had happened. Two strange men,
he told every one, had been found in the hall, and in an attempt
to seize them they had first stunned William and then shot Henry.
They had escaped then by the front door.</p>

<p>Sir Charles then had at once assumed command, and vetoed most
emphatically the suggestion that weapons should be obtained from
the gun room and a search made through the grounds with no
delay.</p>

<p>"That will be fool's-play," he scoffed contemptuously, "for of
course they came and went in a car. They will be a couple of
miles away by now." He turned to the shaking butler. "Ring up the
Croydon police," he thundered, "and the flying-squads will be
upon the roads within five minutes and all cars going in any
direction held up and searched. That's our only chance." He
seemed to have become 20 years younger in his animation. "Now,
the next thing is to find out if they got away with any plunder.
Any one seen my uncle?"</p>

<p>And then it was remembered with pangs of horror that neither
the lord nor the lady of the Court had been seen by any one or
appeared to have been awakened by the noise.</p>

<p>"And perhaps they have been murdered in their beds!" squeaked
old Lady Wortleberry, who, attired in a gown of most dreadful
hue, was peering through the banisters above. "Oh! what a
national calamity if the Rostrellor diamonds have gone."</p>

<p>A rush was at once made upstairs to Lady Rostrellor's bedroom.
The door was found to be wide open, but reassuring sounds came
from inside the chamber, for Lord Rostrellor could be heard
snoring in loud trumpet tones and the wheezing breathing of her
ladyship, too, was distinctly audible in the respectful hush
about the chamber door.</p>

<p>With difficulty the pair were awakened and made to understand
that burglars had been visiting the Court. Lady Rostrellor
promptly screamed, but upon pointing to the jar of cold cream,
and it being lifted up and the key of the safe being seen by her
to be still there, she sank back again into the pillows and
subsided into convulsive sobs. Lord Rostrellor contented himself
with shouting loudly for brandy to be brought up.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a tremendous boom was heard below, a blinding
sheet of flame lit up all the windows and then a dreadful
moment's silence was followed by the sounds of a cascade of
falling glass.</p>

<p>"Downstairs, every one!" roared Sir Charles Carrion in
stentorian tones, and literally dancing in his excitement. "It's
'The Terror' and they've blown up the conservatory with a
bomb."</p>


<hr>


<h2><a id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br>

IN THE SHADOW OF THE SCAFFOLD.</h2>

<p class="first">THE morning following upon the dinner party at
Rostrellor Court, a few minutes after seven, Larose was dressing
himself quickly in his lodgings in Pimlico. He had a busy day
before him and was hoping, and indeed expecting, it was going to
be one of great triumph for him as well.</p>

<p>He was motoring straightaway down to Canvey Island, to learn
there at first hand all he could about the undoubted murder of
the solicitor, Clutterbuck, as evidenced by the latter's sudden
disappearance from all human ken and the trails of blood that had
been left behind.</p>

<p>He was intending to return to the city as early as possible in
the afternoon, and was hoping then to throw another bomb into the
well-ordered, but very difficult-to-be-convinced, mind of the
Chief Commissioner of Police.</p>

<p>"He still won't believe me about this Sheldon-Brown," he
muttered with a grim smile, "so I'll just put him wise as to the
character of one of that gentleman's nice associates, with whom
Brown must have been pretty familiar to have been flashing those
bonds-to-bearer before him, as we know he did."</p>

<p>He was just in the act of lathering his face, when he heard
the telephone ring in the hall below, and a few seconds later his
ex-policeman landlord tapped at the door and called out that a
lady wanted to speak to him at once.</p>

<p>"It's the wife, of course," thought Larose, hurriedly wiping
the lather from his face&mdash;his heart gave a big
thump&mdash;"but why has she rung up so early? I hope to heaven,
nothing has happened down there!"</p>

<p>But it did not prove to be Mrs. Larose who was ringing; it was
a voice he did not remember which greeted him directly he
announced that he was there.</p>

<p>"I'm Miss Lendon," it came in quick and agitated tones, "and
we met at Mrs. Fox-Drummond's, at Surbiton, just over a week ago,
when you stayed to lunch there."</p>

<p>"Oh! I remember you," replied Larose at once. "Well, what can
I do for you, Miss Lendon?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Choisy-Hautville wants you to come here to him at
once," replied Angela breathlessly. "I'm speaking from Rostrellor
Court, in Addington, near Croydon. A terrible calamity has
happened during the night. The house has been broken into, one of
the servants murdered, the conservatory blown up with a bomb, and
now it's been discovered all Lady Rostrellor's diamonds have been
taken."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" ejaculated Larose in consternation, "and was
Monsieur de Choisy-Hautville hurt?"</p>

<p>"No, he's quite all right," replied Angela. "I said it was one
of the servants who had been killed."</p>

<p>"But how is it that my friend is staying at Rostrellor Court?"
asked Larose, very puzzled. "He never said anything to me about
it."</p>

<p>"No, because no one had even thought about it until yesterday
at lunch-time," replied the girl, "and then, to oblige, Mrs. Fox-Drummond he agreed to come here with us just for the one night,
as there was a gentleman short for the big dinner-party."</p>

<p>"Then why is it he isn't ringing me up himself?" asked
Larose.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you why," replied the girl quickly, "and I don't
understand it myself. I've not seen him since last night, and all
I know is that he pushed a note under my bedroom door not five
minutes ago, asking me to ring you up to come at once, and not
tell anyone he'd sent for you. He marked the note urgent." Her
voice betrayed her anxiety. "Now you will come, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, I will," replied Larose instantly. "I'll be out in
less than an hour. But one thing more," he added, as she thanked
him and was preparing to ring off, "you've got the police up
there, of course."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, the Croydon ones were here almost at once," she
replied, "and others have been coming during the night. They say
the heads of Scotland Yard, too, will be here before 9
o'clock,"&mdash;she seemed very frightened&mdash;"and orders have
been given that none of us are to leave the house, because it is
thought it was opened to the burglars by some one here
inside."</p>

<p>"All right," exclaimed Larose cheerfully. "I'll be with you as
soon as I can."</p>

<p>"Now, what the devil does all this mean?" he asked, frowningly
as he hung up the receiver. "Have the police by any chance
tumbled to whom de Choisy-Hautville is?" He looked most uneasy
for a moment and then his face cleared. "No, no, he's had nothing
to do with the taking of the diamonds. I can trust Croupin as I
would myself now." He gave a low whistle. "But that bomb! It must
be the work of the same gang, and what a coincidence that Croupin
has got in touch with them again!"</p>

<p>Well within the time specified he drove up to Rostrellor
Court. The front door was standing wide open and, springing from
his car, he was just about to explain to the uniformed constable
who was in charge there whom he was, when he saw Detective-Inspector Reynolds from Scotland yard, whom he knew well, just
inside the hall.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Inspector," he called out, "then we are all
early birds this morning."</p>

<p>The inspector at once came forward to shake hands, but at the
same time it seemed to Larose that he did not look too pleased.
"How is it you have come here, Mr. Larose?" he asked sharply.
"Has the Chief sent you down to look after us?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" replied Larose, shaking his head. "I haven't
had any communication with him for a couple of days, but hearing
there had been an explosion, I thought I'd run down and pay you
all a flying visit."</p>

<p>"But how then did you come to know anything about it?" asked
the inspector, looking rather puzzled. "There's nothing in the
newspapers as yet."</p>

<p>Larose laughed lightly. "Oh! I have my own sources of
information, Inspector," he replied, "and just now anything to do
with bombs interests me." His face became serious. "Found out
anything yet?"</p>

<p>"Yes," grunted the inspector, leading Larose into a small room
just off the hall, "quite a lot. For one thing, someone inside
the house opened the front door for the burglars, and they came
in like more invited guests." He nodded with a grim smile. "But
we've got one gay gentleman under close observation, one of the
blessed dinner-party, too, and there are some things about him
that are mighty suspicious. He was seen here in the hall only a
few minutes before the rumpus occurred, and can't give me a
satisfactory explanation. He's a damned foreigner with a jaw-breaking name."</p>

<p>Larose suppressed a start. He thought he could understand
Angela's phoning up now. "What's his name?" he asked
carelessly.</p>

<p>"de Chossy Hoveal, or something like that," replied the
inspector. "He's a bird with fine feathers, and I feel darned
sure"&mdash;but seeing the amazed expression upon Larose's face,
he stopped suddenly and asked with a frown. "What's up?"</p>

<p>"Great Jupiter!" exclaimed Larose in apparent consternation,
"why, if it's the de Choisy-Hautville I know, he's just been
working for the Yard himself." He spoke very quickly. "What's he
like? A very good-looking man slightly built, with very dark
eyes?"</p>

<p>"That's him," growled the inspector, "almost as pretty as a
girl. But I tell you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Man!" interrupted Larose quickly, "he's a great friend of
mine and as good as gold. Up to a few days ago, he was working in
the slums of Limehouse for me, and looking like a scarecrow,
trailing one of the men wanted for all those murders. To-day we
are going to make a first arrest, and this afternoon the chief
will probably be shaking my friend by the hand, because it is
thanks to him that we shall have got the man."</p>

<p>"I don't care a curse about that," said the inspector
doggedly. "I'm in charge here and his answers to my questions are
not satisfactory. I've made some other inquiries about him, too,
outside, and they're not too good, either, I can tell you." He
looked as stubborn as a mule. "I believe he had some part in the
stealing of these jewels."</p>

<p>"Gosh!" ejaculated Larose, "de Choisy-Hautville stealing
anything! Why, he's as rich as a nabob and could probably buy up
Lord Rostrellor here. He's got a suite of rooms at the
Savoy!"</p>

<p>"So he told me," said the inspector drily, "and I've just been
ringing up there and learnt quite a lot of things." His face
assumed a most determined expression. "Nothing alters the fact
that the explanation of his movements here are not
satisfactory."</p>

<p>"Well, where is he now?" asked Larose quietly. "Have you put
him under arrest?"</p>

<p>"Almost," replied the inspector. "I've got him in a room by
himself and he's not allowed to go out"&mdash;he set his jaw and
looked defiantly at Larose&mdash;"and he's not going out either,
whether he's a friend of yours or anybody else's, until he has
satisfied me as to why he was in the hall at five minutes past
one this morning, not a quarter of an hour before those burglars
were discovered here."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, bring him in here, Inspector," said Larose
quietly, "and I'll make him explain everything."</p>

<p>So two minutes later Croupin was being ushered into the room,
to be received with a scowl by the inspector and a smile by
Larose.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Monsieur," grinned Larose. "I understand you
are in trouble."</p>

<p>Croupin, looking very solemn, shook hands with Larose, with no
answering expression of amusement, however, upon his handsome
face.</p>

<p>"Yes," he nodded, "it pleases this gentleman not to believe
what I say."</p>

<p>"And I don't believe it," commented the inspector
emphatically. "That footman saw you talking to some one in the
hall just before those men were found inside, and you deny it."
His tone was most uncompromising. "I am of opinion that you had
just opened the door to your friends, and were keeping watch for
them while they went upstairs."</p>

<p>"Tell us what happened, Monsieur," said Larose. "You'll have
to explain," and then, as Croupin hesitated, he added quickly.
"Come, now, I've told the inspector here you are my friend, and
you're not going to discredit me. Is it true you were not
speaking to any one?"</p>

<p>Croupin spoke very slowly. "There are some occasions,
Monsieur," he replied, "'when a falsehood is more honourable than
the truth."</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" exclaimed Larose, now all smiles, "then tell
Inspector Reynolds who the lady was, and I'll promise you for him
that it won't go any further. Make a clean breast of it to
us."</p>

<p>Croupin gave a great sigh, but seeing that there was no help
for it explained frankly what had happened. He had been sitting
in the conservatory, he said, talking to a lady, and they had not
noticed how time was flying until suddenly the lights had gone
out in the drawing-room behind them, and they were astounded to
realise that it was a quarter to one. Then not wishing to
occasion any scandal by encountering any of the servants, they
had waited a few minutes longer, until there should be no one
about. Then at the foot of the staircase, he had bade the young
lady good-night and waited yet another two minutes, until she had
ascended the staircase alone and gained the privacy of her own
room.</p>

<p>The face of the inspector had lost a little of its sternness
and then, almost as if he were himself now suppressing a grin, he
asked drily: "And will the young lady be prepared to corroborate
this story, when I question her?"</p>

<p>"She would," replied Croupin with dignity. "If I had given you
her name."</p>

<p>"I don't want it," snapped the inspector, "for I know she was
Miss Angela Lendon"&mdash;he looked triumphantly at
Larose&mdash;"and at 7.25 this morning she rang up Pimlico 3908
to summon your friend here to get you out of the mess." He looked
down at a paper in his hand. "She is the only woman who has
'phoned from here this morning."</p>

<p>Larose laughed merrily. "Excellent! excellent! Mr. Inspector,"
he exclaimed, "and with men like you at the Yard, there was never
any need for any one to have asked me to come back." His face
glowed. "I take off my hat to you, sir."</p>

<p>For the moment, the expression of praise from such a quarter
caused the face of the inspector to redden with pleasure, but
then almost instantly it grew hard and grim again.</p>

<p>"But there are other things I want to know about this
gentleman," he said sharply. "He told me he has a suite of rooms
at the Savoy, and I have verified that, but"&mdash;and his voice
was very stern&mdash;"how is it he has been staying at the
Semiris for four days under an assumed name? No, no," he went on
to Croupin, noticing the latter's look of discomforted chagrin,
"it's no good your denying it, for a chambermaid from the Savoy
recognised you. You have been staying at the Semiris under the
name of a Monsieur de Bearne, and the Savoy people are now aware
of it, too."</p>

<p>Larose burst into a hearty laugh. "Another bull's eye,
Inspector," he laughed, "for this de Bearne has been acting as a
decoy there for what may probably turn out to be one of the
biggest receivers that the Yard has laid hands upon for many a
day"&mdash;he made a grimace at Croupin&mdash;"but I see I'll
have to go round to the Savoy people and explain things a bit, or
they'll be asking you to vacate that nice suite of yours
straightaway."</p>

<p>They chatted on for a few minutes and then the inspector with
a mock sigh of resignation, turned to Croupin.</p>

<p>"You're free, Monsieur," he said, "and I admit I'm darned
sorry for it." He smiled. "I heard that footman's story, and
now"&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"I'm afraid there's
nothing in it."</p>

<p>To the evident relief of the inspector, Larose said he must be
going at once, and Croupin accompanied him to his car to see him
off. "Thank you, Monsieur," said the Frenchman gratefully. "You
got me out of a very awkward situation and there will be no
scandal." His eyes sparkled. "But see here, Meester Larose, I
think this is the work of the gang, for that explosion was so
senseless after the diamonds had been stolen. They could have
expected to gain nothing by it, except the terrifying of
everyone."</p>

<p>"I agree," said Larose promptly, "but I'm not interfering
here, for the good reason I've got quite enough on my hands to-day: I can't be everywhere."</p>

<p>"But one moment," said Croupin as Larose was about to start up
his engine. "There's no doubt they had an accomplice inside who
let them come in and I think I know who he is," and then very
rapidly he told of the hand he and Angela had seen parting the
palm leaves in the conservatory. "But that is not all," he added
mysteriously, "for when one of the guests here, a doctor of
renown, was bending over the footman who had been shot and
opening his vest, it came upon me in a flash that he had the same
long, white hand." He nodded emphatically. "I am almost sure of
it."</p>

<p>"And who is this doctor, then?" asked Larose, all eyes and
interest.</p>

<p>"A Sir Charles Carrion," replied Croupin, "and Lady Rostrellor
is his aunt."</p>

<p>"Then it's impossible," said Larose. "That makes it so at
once."</p>

<p>"Not at all," went on Croupin, "for he's a most eccentric man,
and they say he has been put in an asylum once. He seems
delighted about all this trouble here, and although he says how
dreadful it is he keeps on chuckling and rubbing his hands. When
the bomb exploded last night, of course everyone was terrified,
but he made things much worse by shouting out 'The Terror! The
Terror!' and warning us all that another bomb might be exploding
any moment. He didn't, however, seem at all frightened himself. I
tell you&mdash;&mdash;" but he suddenly gripped Larose tightly by
the arm&mdash;"Look out, here he comes, and that man he is
laughing with is one of the detectives. Don't let him see we are
noticing him. He is the tall man with the dreadful face."</p>

<p>Larose turned his head slightly, and out of the tail of his
eye regarded the man indicated.</p>

<p>"Hum!" he remarked when the two had passed round the side of
the house, "we must go into this, Monsieur, you and I. I must
manage to get in touch with him in some way." He paused for a
moment. "He looks very ill. Is he practising, do you know?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," replied Croupin, "for I heard him telling the
superintendent for Croydon that he must be back at his consulting
room in town by two this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Then get friendly with him," said Larose, "as friendly as
possible in the time, and tell him you know someone who's
had"&mdash;he thought for a moment&mdash;"who's had trouble in
his stomach, and you may be sending him along one day for a
consultation. See! that will pave the way for me to go and have a
close up view of him, without awakening any suspicion when he
finds there is nothing the matter with me."</p>

<p>"Bien!" nodded Croupin. "I understand," and with a wave of his
hand Larose disappeared up the drive.</p>

<p>In the meantime Guildford had passed a very disturbed and
troubled night, or rather that part of the night that had still
remained after he had got back to the bungalow upon the lake-side. He was sure no one could have been an observer of his
return, and for awhile had been thrilled into ecstasy and
forgetfulness by the jewels he had poured out upon a sheet of
newspaper upon the floor. He had chosen the floor instead of the
table, so that no glimmer of light should show outside.</p>

<p>He had not dared to make use of any lamp, although he had
taken the paraffin one off the shelf and was in the act of
lighting it when he had thought suddenly what curiosity it would
excite in any one seeing it at that time of the night. If by any
chance they came to pass near, and so it was by the light of his
torch only that he had examined the booty he had acquired. Never
had he seen such riches before, and of a disposition in which
sound common sense predominated, he then and there formed the
resolution that this should be his last adventure in unlawful
ways, and he would now clear out of the country as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>He drank half a tumbler of neat brandy and ate some sandwiches
with good appetite, all the while going carefully over in his
mind his plans for the morrow. He would tempt fortune no more he
told himself, and would leave the bungalow as speedily as
possible. It would be downright folly to wait the few days as Sir
Charles Carrion had suggested, for the body of Voisin was now
adding to his dangers, and if anyone came upon it, it would be
suggestive as to which way he had taken in his hurried flight
from the Court, and might also put into people's minds the idea
that he had not escaped in a car.</p>

<p>He threw himself upon one of the beds, hoping he might obtain
a few hours' sleep, but for a long time he slept only in fitful
snatches, awakening many times to see if the dawn had really
come. Then, when at last the sun rose, it did so above a heavy
pall of fog, and, his sleep deepening, it was not finally until
nearly nine o'clock that he awoke to curse furiously that the
hour was so late. He did not wonder, however, that he had slept
on, for the light in the house, even now, was very shadowy and
dim.</p>

<p>He started hurriedly, but with extreme care and method, to
make all preparations for his departure. He put on a pair of
woollen gloves, and then, with a duster, wiped over everywhere he
thought either he or Voisin had left any finger marks, the two
glasses, the two plates and knives and forks they had used at
supper, the handles and panels of the doors, and every place
where he imagined their hands could have touched. Then, having
tidied up everything and left the bungalow, he thought, exactly
as they had found it, he drove his car out of the garage, and in
quite a confident and cheerful frame of mind he started for
town.</p>

<p>He went by way of Hayes and West Wickham and met plenty of
traffic, but no one stopped him, and finally he arrived home soon
after 11 o'clock. He was now assured that all danger was over and
that no one would ever know he had been anywhere near Rostrellor
Court that night.</p>

<p>Guildford's blood would have frozen in terror if he had been
aware of exactly what was happening at that very moment in the
bungalow upon the lakeside.</p>

<p>The police were in possession, and with every bit as much care
as he had taken and with equal method and precision, half a dozen
grim-faced men, the most acute brains in Scotland Yard, were
endeavouring to find out something about the two individuals who
had been staying there the previous night. He had only just
escaped in time.</p>

<p>It had happened in this way:</p>

<p>In their headlong flight from Rostrellor Court, Guildford had
urged furiously upon the barber that the danger point of their
journey lay at that spot where they had to cross over the Keston
Road, close near to the two houses. All the rest of the way they
were under cover, either in the thick woods or else beside the
high hedges of fields that no one was likely to be frequenting at
night. But on this road there was no cover, and it was always
possible they might be seen.</p>

<p>And Guildford had been quite right. Not only was there the
danger there, but he had run straight into it, for during many
hours of that night a watcher had sat before an upper window of
one of the two houses Guildford was so fearing, and had moreover
seen the two men set out, and then later only the one return.</p>

<p>The watcher was the local doctor of Farnborough, and he was
waiting upon a patient who was expecting one of the most
thrilling adventures of her life&mdash;her first gift to human
kind. The doctor had been sitting idly before the window, hoping
every minute to receive the summons.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he had noticed two men running quickly across
the road from wood to wood, appearing from the depths of one to
disappear into the depths of another.</p>

<p>"Poachers!" he told himself, "and after old Colonel Roach's
pheasants! Good! Then I'll ring him up about it to-morrow, and
then perhaps he'll remember to pay his little bill."</p>

<p>He had looked at the time and seen it was half-past twelve.
Then, his vigil being prolonged, about twenty minutes to two he
had heard a muffled bang in the distance as if three or four guns
had been discharged at the same time, and about a quarter of an
hour later he had seen the one man literally fly across the road
and disappear into the opposite wood.</p>

<p>He had thought everything very suspicious, but then at that
moment the stork at last dropping a lusty squealing infant down
the chimney, he had been kept busy for some time and later
feeling dead sleepy, and thinking only of getting back to his
bed, he had for the time being dismissed the whole matter from
his mind.</p>

<p>But it had all been recalled with great suddenness the next
morning, when upon starting upon his rounds he had been stopped
by the village policeman, who had poured into his ears a lurid
and exciting story of what had been happening at Rostrellor
Court. Then he in turn had told his story, and the policeman,
rushing to the telephone, a quarter of an hour later the busy
medico was being chased up hill and down dale, all over the
countryside, by a car filled with the crack trailers of Scotland
Yard.</p>

<p>In possession of all the facts, the detectives had at once
made a beeline for the wood into which the one man had
disappeared, and following a well-defined track, they had come
speedily to the lonely bungalow upon the lake-side.</p>

<p>It was shut up and apparently unoccupied, but they saw at once
from the markings in the ground, that a car had but recently left
the garage, and so, with no hesitation, they forced an entry into
the bungalow itself.</p>

<p>Then instantly they came upon a most damning piece of
evidence&mdash;a diamond ring, close to the leg of the table in
the kitchen!</p>

<p>That was Guildford's first mistake, and it was going to prove
a very costly one for him.</p>

<p>But it was easy to understand how it had occurred. He had been
so anxious to examine his booty, the very moment he had got back
to the bungalow, and hurriedly emptying his pockets upon the
sheet of newspaper upon the floor and using only his electric
torch with its small and circumscribed area of light, he had not
noticed the rolling away of one of the rings into the shadows
cast by the table leg.</p>

<p>The detectives were overjoyed at their discovery, and like
bloodhounds nosed about for a further trail. It was finger-marks
they wanted, for a big burglary like that at Rostrellor Court,
they told themselves, had not been carried out by novices at the
game, but by experienced criminals who had been at the same kind
of work before.</p>

<p>So they proceeded to go over the bungalow, inch by inch, and
were soon nodding significantly to one another when not a single
recent finger mark could be found anywhere. Neither upon the
tumblers, nor upon the handles of the knives and forks, nor upon
the dresser doors, nor upon any of the cupboards or chairs.</p>

<p>"Old lags," snarled Detective Inspector Reynolds angrily, "and
they cleaned up everywhere with gloved hands before they went
away."</p>

<p>But they were quite certain two men had been staying at the
bungalow, for two tumblers on the dresser were cleaner and more
polished than the rest, and it was the same with two cups and
saucers, and two plates upon the rack.</p>

<p>Then to their great joy they came upon Guildford's second
mistake, a set of beautifully defined oily finger-marks upon the
under surface of the sheet of newspaper that had been spread so
tidily upon the kitchen table by some former tenants. The paper
had obviously been used by them to save the table from contact
with hot saucepans and pans, and it was the same sheet that
Guildford had picked up when he had poured out the jewels upon
the floor, just after he had replaced the paraffin lamp upon the
shelf.</p>

<p>The finger-marks were undoubtedly so recent that a whoop of
delight came up from the detectives when they were discovered,
and another exclamation of joy came when a few minutes later
finger marks upon one of the cupboard-doors in a bedroom were
seen also. Voisin had been more curious than Guildford, and
unknown to the latter, had had a look all round the bungalow.</p>

<p>So photographs were at once taken, and together with the sheet
of newspaper hurried up to Scotland Yard. Thus, when about four
o'clock that afternoon Larose appeared up at the Yard to
interview the Chief Commissioner, he found that very interested
gentleman in earnest conversation with one of the officials from
the finger-print department.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the Commissioner delightedly, "the very man I
want." He dismissed the finger-print expert and then asked
sharply: "Now what does it mean, sir, that you were here
yesterday with some finger marks that proved to be those of a
convict, Sabine Guildford, who was released on ticket-of-leave
ten and a half years ago?"</p>

<p>Larose looked the picture of astonishment, but he recovered
himself quickly and replied at once: "I was interested in them,
sir," he smiled dryly, "as those of an associate of that Mr.
Sheldon-Brown, and as a matter of fact have come here
now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, good God! man," broke in the Commissioner, "do you know
where he is?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Larose, "and as I was just going to say,
if you want him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the Commissioner could not contain himself in his
excitement. "If we want him!" he almost shouted, interrupting
again. "Why, he is one of two men who got in Rostrellor Court
last night, and getting away with I don't know how many thousand
pounds of jewellery, killed a footman who tried to stop him.
Apart from these fingerprints, too, some of the other servants
furnish a description that tallies exactly with how he would look
today." He dropped his voice to even tones, and forcing his lips
into a smile, asked quietly: "Where is he, then, Mr. Larose?"</p>

<p>Larose was astonished beyond measure at the Commissioner's
news, and then at once his heart gave a great bound of delight.
Things could not be better, he told himself, for now they could
arrest Guildford on this later charge, and then the other members
of the gang would not be warned that anything had been found out
about any of them in relation to their crimes of dreadful
vengeance.</p>

<p>He replied quickly to the Commissioner. "Sabine Guildford is
now an estate agent in Mile End," he said, "and he goes under the
name of Edward Mason." He smiled in amusement. "The Yard has been
shadowing him for me for over a week now and he could have been
arrested any moment had we wished, for he is a burglar, a
receiver of stolen goods, and"&mdash;he paused a long moment
here, and then went on very sternly&mdash;"as an associate of
Sheldon-Brown, the undoubted murderer of Samuel Wiggins, the tea-broker, and of Anthony Clutterbuck, the solicitor." His voice
vibrated as he threw down his trump card. "He is another member
of 'The Terror Gang.'"</p>

<p>And then in ample detail he related all that had happened
during the past few days, by no means slurring over the part
Croupin had taken in getting in touch with Voisin and Guildford
and obtaining their finger-prints.</p>

<p>When he had finished, the Commissioner after a few words of
ungrudging praise, in turn related all that had happened at the
bungalow by the Kestor lakes and how fortunate they had been in
picking up the trail so soon.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Larose," he said in conclusion, "as you say, we can
arrest this Sabine Guildford at once upon this charge, and so
give no specific warning to the other members of the gang,
whoever they may be." He looked rather troubled. "But how do you
suggest we do it, for he is a dangerous man and very ready with
his gun, and naturally I am thinking of our men."</p>

<p>"And he is suspicious, too," added Larose, "for he's dodged us
every time when we were trying to follow him. He got away
yesterday, and we couldn't tell where he had gone."</p>

<p>"But he must be taken at once," went on the Commissioner, "for
to all accounts, he's got hold of a good &pound;80,000 this time,
and that's enough to make any man get out of business for good.
He may try and bolt straightaway."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Larose, "and the devil of it is we are certain
he's got one exit into that back street, and I'm half inclined to
believe he's got several." He considered for a moment, "But I've
got an idea how we can do it."</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>Guildford had been in a great state of exultation since he had
returned home. Things could not have gone better. He was in
possession or valuables that he reckoned he could dispose of
abroad for about &pound;50,000, and he had got rid of Voisin, who
could have been an awkward witness, and moreover, would have
wanted a good sum as his share.</p>

<p>He treated himself to a pint bottle of champagne for his
lunch, and then gave orders he was not to be disturbed for a
couple of hours as he was not feeling well and was going to lie
down.</p>

<p>And certainly he was very tired, for he dropped off to sleep
within a few minutes and slept soundly until just before five
o'clock, when he was awakened by loud shouting in the street
below, and jumping hurriedly off the bed to find out what had
happened, was greatly relieved to see from the window which faced
the street, that it was only a lorry that had broken down. One of
the wheels had come off just opposite his office and, of course,
the usual crowd of idlers had at once gathered round.</p>

<p>For a few minutes he watched them jacking up the lorry, but
was then interrupted by a knocking at the door. It was his
housekeeper, and one of the clerks, she announced, wanted to
speak to him with no delay.</p>

<p>He went down at once to his private room and was then informed
that a man wanted to see him, with a message from some one called
Flick, about a key that he had ordered to be made.</p>

<p>Guildford's heart began to palpitate at once. "What's the man
like?" he asked with a deep frown.</p>

<p>The clerk smiled. "Well, he's a rough looking customer, sir,"
he replied, "and he's not too sober, either. He's carrying two
large bundles of celery, and he's dropped them several times upon
the floor."</p>

<p>"Tell him I'm busy," growled Guildford, "and ask him to send
in the message."</p>

<p>The clerk retired at once, and obeying his instructions, was
met with a blunt refusal from the man with the celery and thick
voice.</p>

<p>"No, I'll not give the message to you," insisted that
individual pugnaciously. "I was told only to give it to Mr.
Mason, and it'd be worth a couple of bob to me if I did. I've got
a bit of a letter, too," he added, as if he was now remembering
it for the first time. His voice was thicker than ever. "So you
tell old Mason to come here at once."</p>

<p>Guildford was looking through the chink of the office door,
and watching the speaker. All he saw was a grubby-faced man,
leaning against the counter, in the usual lordly way of the
slightly intoxicated, and clutching tightly to two big bundles of
celery.</p>

<p>He strode quickly into the office and advanced towards the
stranger. "I'm Mr. Mason," he announced sternly, "and now, what's
your message."</p>

<p>The man blinked stupidly at him. "Ugly and cross-looking," he
muttered as if to himself, "and looks a man who'd fight anyone."
He brightened up at once. "Yes, that's you," he said. "You're Mr.
Mason." He put the two bundles of celery under one arm, and then
with the hand of the other fumbled in his jacket pocket for the
letter. He found it at last. "Here you are," he grunted, "and the
message is inside."</p>

<p>But he suddenly drew back the hand that was proffering the
letter. "Two bob, first," he said stubbornly. "I've not come all
this distance for nothing, and boot-leather costs money."</p>

<p>With a scowl of annoyance, but rather uneasy that Alf Flick
should be communicating with him at all, and anxious to read what
was in the letter, Guildford thrust his right hand into his
trouser pocket for the two shillings and then&mdash;the
astounding thing happened.</p>

<p>The seemingly intoxicated man in the twinkling of an eye flung
the celery straight into Guildford's face and then, like a flash
of lightning, he sprang forward and pinning the estate-agent's
arms to his side, tripped him violently on to the floor. At the
same time, with a clarion voice he trumpeted: "Come in, quick.
I've got him."</p>

<p>One of the clerks jumped instantly to the rescue of his
master, and gripped the assailant by the throat, but half a dozen
men who had been standing outside and apparently idly watching
the stranded lorry, burst into the office, and, quicker than it
takes to tell, the clerk had been hurled away, and Guildford
handcuffed and jerked on to his feet.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt, Mr. Larose?" asked one of the men of the owner
of the celery.</p>

<p>"Not a bit," replied Larose. He turned to the clerk who had
handled him so roughly. "Here, young fellow," he said with a
smile, as he started to rub his neck, "you can have these sticks
of celery for your pluck. You are a brave chap, and did the right
thing in trying to protect your master."</p>

<p>Guildford's face was ashen grey, and he heaved out his breaths
in quick jerks. "I thought you'd be in it," he gasped, "but if
I'd been sure five seconds earlier, you'd have had a bullet
through your head."</p>

<p>"He's got a gun," said one of the men, tugging an automatic
pistol from Guildford's hip pocket. "I'm Inspector Reynolds," he
added, turning to the handcuffed man, "and I arrest you for the
murder of Henry Ashby, of Rostrellor Court. I warn you that
anything you say may be used as evidence against you."</p>

<p>"You big fool!" sneered Guildford. "I'm not going to say
anything, and you can hold your tongue as well," and two minutes
later the estate agent of Mile End had bidden good-bye to his
office for ever.</p>

<p>That night Ah Chung said to his relation, "There will be
changes here now, Ho Ling, and we will go quickly. That Mr. Mason
has been taken by the police to-day. He has stolen jewels from a
great lord and he killed a servant there. He will be hanged
soon."</p>

<p>"Thou art wonderful, O, Ah Chung," said Ho Ling, "for so
quickly thou learnest everything."</p>

<p>"This morning I went into Voisin's," droned on Ah Chung, "and
made a search there. He was a careful man and I found &pound;204
in a box under the floor. It will pay for our journey to our
country. He will not need it, for he is dead."</p>

<p>"The dead have no want of meat or drink," commented Ho Ling
solemnly, "for the earth and the waters are their home."</p>

<p>"The police came into his house to-night," went on Ah Chung,
"and it was well that I had shut the secret door. But I saw, and
I listened, and they told strange tales. They said Voisin's hands
had been tied behind him, and he was suffocated in the mud of a
ditch. He had been with Mr. Mason to the lord's house and been
hurt, and he could not run. They said Mr. Mason had killed
him."</p>

<p>"Death is all peace and rest," said Ho Ling softly, "and so
Voisin will labour and be weary no more."</p>

<p>"To-morrow I shall go to Mr. Brown or Sir Carrion," said Ah
Chung, "and ask for our reward. We shall keep silent tongues and
they will give us &pound;1000. Then we will destroy that pit for
the rats and break up all those cages, so that nothing will be
here if the police come." He waved his hand to his relation. "Thy
dreams be happy ones, O, Ho Ling, for in another moon we shall be
among the waters of our home," and with a bow of profound
obedience and respect, Ho Ling glided from the room.</p>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br>

THE REJUVENATION OF AH CHUNG.</h2>

<p class="first">ABOUT seven o'clock upon the morning following
the arrest of Guildford, Sir Charles Carrion was seated at his
desk. He looked haggard and worn. He was writing upon a large
sheet of paper in rather crabbed handwriting.</p>

<p>"Life itself is the great mystery of life. We come we know not
where, and we go we know not whither, and in our dreaming only
are we certain of what lies beyond."</p>

<p>He put down his pen, and looking up murmured meditatively.
"Yes, in all times Death has held to its dark secret, and it is
in the grave only that it whispers out its tale." He grinned.
"Mr. Sabine Guildford will be soon listening to it, for he will
swing for the murder of that footman right enough." He sighed.
"And I shall hear it, too, in months, weeks&mdash;it may be
almost in a few days, for I am very ill." He puckered up his
brows. "Funny that we four are bachelors, Guildford, Bascoigne,
Libbeus, and I myself!"</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, and then continued his train of
thought. "Now I wonder if any of us would have been different if
we had married, for it seems somehow that in constant
companionship a woman saps the spirit of adventure from a man.
Not the women who flit across those burning moments of our youth,
but the woman who year upon year sleeps by our side, for then in
an intimacy bereft of passion it seems that she acquires a hold
upon us, even as a mother acquires the hold upon her child."</p>

<p>He picked up his pen and wrote on. "The glory of Life is Youth
but it is not given to Youth to wear its crown. Youth never
realises its sovereignty, or has visions of the mighty kingdom
that it owns." He sighed again, but more heavily this time. "It
is not until the sunset comes that we take notice of the beauty
of the sky."</p>

<p>He stopped writing and looked up thoughtfully. "Ah! and there
is that young Benson there, and if I had my way he should know
none of youth's sweet follies, for I would take all his youth
from him and give it to some unknown old man." He paused for a
few moments and then shook his head frowningly as if he were
arguing with himself. "No, life is always pitiless and cruel, and
it is written in the order of things that one man's success and
happiness shall be bought always with another's failure and
distress." He shrugged his shoulders carelessly. "So what does it
matter if this boy suffers for the advancement of all
mankind?"</p>

<p>His eyes glistened. "Ah! but it would be the crowning
achievement of my life and I should go down to all history as one
of the world's greatest sons!" He leant back despondently in his
chair. "But search while I will I cannot, I cannot lay my hands
upon the old man I want, and I see I cannot go on detaining the
boy here much longer, for both his mother and his betrothed are
agreeable people and their eagerness to have him back home
distresses me. They are convinced, too, that he is well enough to
leave now."</p>

<p>He wrote on for a long time, and then later after a frugal
breakfast of a cup of coffee and one small piece of toast, walked
round to the private hospital adjoining his residence.</p>

<p>His house was in the best part of Hampstead, and stood alone
in some four acres of well-timbered grounds, surrounded by a high
wall, well spiked at the top. The house itself was an old one,
but some years before he had built on to it a most elaborate
private hospital, equipped in every particular with the most
modern improvements.</p>

<p>Time was when it had been always full, and he had kept a large
staff, but his incarceration in a mental asylum for upwards of
three years had mowed down his practice, and now his staff
consisted of only two nurses and a wardmaid. For the time being
the only patient under his care was a young fellow, Alan Benson,
of twenty-three, who had recently been operated upon for
appendicitis.</p>

<p>With slow and lagging footsteps, for he was feeling very ill,
Sir Charles walked into the room where his patient was, and
frowned with annoyance when he saw a young and very pretty girl
seated by the bedside.</p>

<p>"Good morning, young lady," he said gruffly, "so you are
upsetting my patient again, I see." Then noticing that she was
flushing uncomfortably, he patted her gently upon the shoulder,
and added with a fatherly smile. "But there, there, a little
palpitation won't do him any harm. He's not as bad as all
that."</p>

<p>"And when will he be able to come home, Sir Charles?" she
asked eagerly. "He says he feels quite well and strong."</p>

<p>"You wait outside for a few minutes," he replied, taking in
admiringly her blue eyes and beautiful colour, "and then,
perhaps, I'll be able to tell you."</p>

<p>He examined the young man very carefully, and then announced
slowly: "You're getting on well, my boy, but I am not satisfied
that it is wise for you to leave just yet." He nodded. "Give it
another three or four days and then it'll be quite all
right."</p>

<p>He walked slowly from the room with thoughts in his mind that
would have terrified the young couple could they but have known
them. "I'll ring the Home for Aged Seamen," he told himself, "I
helped young Pitcher to get through his exam, and he ought to be
willing to oblige me now. I must certainly get some one within
the next few days."</p>

<p>The girl was sitting again by the bedside. "Oh! how splendid!"
she exclaimed. "He told me you could come home on Saturday!" Her
eyes filled with tears. "Dearest, we have been so anxious."</p>

<p>"And I have some glorious news, too," said the boy, "that I
was just going to tell you when my jailer came in." His eyes
sparkled. "Lord Macklin told dad yesterday that as I can speak
French and German he could get me into the Diplomatic Service,
and dad says if so we can be married at once." He pressed her
hand very softly. "You would like that, wouldn't you,
sweetheart?"</p>

<p>She pretended to hesitate. "Yes, I suppose so," she replied.
She sighed prettily. "I have given my promise and I won't draw
back."</p>

<p>The boy laughed mockingly. "And you don't want to, of course,
you little angel!" His voice trembled. "Now what about next month
on your birthday, on the 12th?"</p>

<p>She bent down and pressed close to him so that he should not
see her face. "No, dearest," she whispered softly, "it shall be
on your birthday, the 27th." She kissed him tenderly. "It will be
so sweet my coming to you as your birthday present."</p>

<p>And at that moment Sir Charles Carrion was ringing up Dr.
Pitcher, the superintendent of the Home for Aged Seamen to
inquire if the doctor could spare him a few minutes if he came
round early in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Now, so great is the influence of the mind upon the body that,
notwithstanding the physical condition of the great surgeon, a
little while later he was being driven up to his consulting rooms
with quite a cheerful and happy expression upon his face, for Dr.
Pitcher had replied that he would be delighted to see him, and
would arrange to be at liberty any time he called.</p>

<p>"And he's sure to have some old man there who is in need of
surgical interference of some kind," had commented Sir Charles,
"so I'll whip the old fellow up here to-night and operate to-morrow. Libbeus daren't refuse to give the anaesthetic for
me."</p>

<p>His nurse greeted him as he came in. "You have four
appointments for this morning, Sir Charles," she said, "and the
first one is at eleven o'clock, but there is a new patient
waiting, who says he will be so much obliged if you could spare
him a few minutes."</p>

<p>Sir Charles looked at his watch. "I'm early," he said, "and
you can show him in. I can spare a quarter of an hour," and so
Larose was almost immediately being ushered into the room.</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," said the ex-detective. "I am sure I am
very much obliged for your seeing me without an appointment. It
is most kind of you."</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Sir Charles with a weary air. "I'm
disengaged for a few minutes, and quite at your service. What can
I do for you?"</p>

<p>Larose produced a visiting card with "Roy Colliver, Gum Creek
Hotel, Kooringa" printed upon it.</p>

<p>"I'm an Australian," he said, "and am only staying here for a
few weeks and I particularly want your advice. I understand my
friend, Monsieur de Choisy-Hautville, spoke to you about me
yesterday and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! so he did," broke in Sir Charles quickly. "He said you
had had stomach trouble and you didn't know whether you ought to
have an operation or not." His eyes twinkled. "A very interesting
gentleman, your friend, and he entertained me quite a lot. We
were at Rostrellor Court, as of course you know, when that
dreadful affair took place there." He clicked his tongue. "Tut!
tut! what is the world coming to when any night respectable
people may be blown sky-high from their beds?" He looked
curiously at Larose. "But now tell me all about yourself."</p>

<p>"Well, it's like this," began Larose starting to relate a tale
that had been most carefully rehearsed that morning with Croupin.
"I keep a hotel, as you see by that card, in Kooringa, in South
Australia, and about four months ago I was camping out with a
friend in a lonely part of the bush about 200 miles further away
from Adelaide, when I was suddenly taken with a violent attack of
appendicitis, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How did you know it was appendicitis?" asked Sir Charles
sharply. "Did you diagnose the nature of the trouble
yourself?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no," replied Larose, "but it happened that two gentlemen
who are both well-known surgeons in Adelaide came driving by in a
car the third day after the attack, and my friend recognising one
of them stopped them and asked them to come into the tent and see
me."</p>

<p>"And they were of opinion you had had appendicitis?" asked Sir
Charles.</p>

<p>"Yes, they said it was a typical case?" replied Larose glibly,
"and they didn't know what could be done for me. We were up in
the bush a long way beyond Lake Frome, and more than 150 miles
from the nearest hospital. The roads were terribly rough, and as
they were in a little two-seater car they were afraid to move me.
They explained everything to me, and said I had quite an even
chance of getting over it, if I lay perfectly still where I was,
especially as the temperature was beginning to go down."</p>

<p>"Oh!" remarked Sir Charles slowly, "and so they went off and
left you?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Larose, "they remained with me for two days, and
then, as I was very much better, they said good-bye, warning me
to not change my position, and not to get up or move about for a
week."</p>

<p>"Were they sure it was appendicitis?" asked Sir Charles with a
frown.</p>

<p>"Perfectly!" said Larose. "I had all the symptoms."</p>

<p>"Then do you remember those symptoms," was the next question,
"and exactly how the pain came on?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" laughed Larose. "I should just think I do.
Every moment of those awful days will be engraved upon my mind
for ever. One minute I was seemingly a perfectly healthy man
enjoying life to the full, and almost the very next I was
writhing about in dreadful agony." He shuddered. "Oh! I shall
never forget it."</p>

<p>"Writhing about, were you?" asked Sir Charles. He spoke in
sharp decisive tones. "Well, tell me exactly how everything
commenced."</p>

<p>"I was sitting before the camp fire," began Larose, "and we
had just finished supper when I got a sharp pain in my right
side, and when I touched it I found it was terribly tender. The
sharp pain kept coming and going like the stabs of a knife and I
became very feverish and violently sick."</p>

<p>"And you were all right again very soon?" asked Sir
Charles.</p>

<p>"Except for a little soreness," replied Larose, "in about 10
days from the time of the first attack, and I have been all right
every since." He looked very uneasy. "But I am worried as to
whether it is safe for me to go back to Australia, without having
an operation. All my friends tell me I might be attacked again on
the voyage."</p>

<p>"And you had never had any attack before?" asked Sir
Charles.</p>

<p>"No," replied Larose, "not the semblance of one."</p>

<p>Sir Charles was now regarding him with a most peculiar
expression upon his face, and almost, Larose thought, as if he
were inclined to be very amused.</p>

<p>Quite a long silence followed and then the great consultant
asked carelessly: "And do you happen to remember the names of
those two Adelaide gentlemen who came so opportunely upon the
scene?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," replied Larose promptly, "and I have written down
their names and qualifications on purpose for you to see," and
producing a small slip of paper, he handed it across to Sir
Charles.</p>

<p>"Ah!" commented the latter dryly, "both Fellows of the College
of Surgeons, England, and both holding hospital appointments in
their city. No doubt both eminent men over there!"</p>

<p>A short silence followed and then suddenly Sir Charles leant
back in his chair and burst into a loud peal of laughter. He
seemed to be enjoying a great joke, and he laughed with such
enjoyment that his face grew red and tears came into his
eyes.</p>

<p>For the moment Larose was too startled and amazed to make any
comment, and almost thinking he must be in the presence of a
madman, he drew back his chair a pace or two.</p>

<p>But Sir Charles's merriment subsided almost as suddenly as it
had arisen and wiping his eyes with his handkerchief, he began
making the most profuse apologies. "I am so sorry," he explained,
"but I really couldn't help it. It is altogether too funny."</p>

<p>"But I don't understand you," said Larose with ruffled
dignity. "I came here as a patient and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you didn't," broke in Sir Charles sharply, and now as
stern as a judge upon the Bench. "You came here as nothing of the
sort, and I want to know what you mean by it." He drew himself up
proudly. "My good sir," he went on contemptuously, "just fancy
you having the impudence to come to one of the greatest abdominal
surgeons of his age and dish up a lot of faked symptoms of
trouble in your stomach, with the expectation of taking him in."
He looked witheringly at Larose. "Why! you never had
appendicitis, my friend, and no medical man in the world, let
alone a Fellow of the College of Surgeons, ever told you so." He
chuckled in amusement. "You've been reading up the symptoms from
a book and got them all muddled up."</p>

<p>After Sir Charles had so deftly called his bluff, Larose felt
an icy feeling running up his back, and his mouth was dry, but he
put on a bold front and said sternly: "Really, Sir Charles, when
I came in here I didn't expect&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To be caught out so easily," interrupted the great surgeon
scornfully. "No, I don't suppose you did." His face was full of
mockery. "And talking about your coming in,
Mr.&mdash;&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&mdash;" he looked about for the card
that Larose had given him, but for the moment could not find
it&mdash;"well, never mind the name, for I'm sure it won't be
your real one, so I'll call you Mr. Snooks, for the moment." He
nodded. "And a very good name that, for I had a dog called Snooks
once, and except that he was an inveterate thief, he was quite an
acquisition to the household."</p>

<p>He started to laugh again, and Larose, utterly discomfited,
thought it wisest to keep silent in the hope that he, in his
turn, might soon trip the baronet in some way.</p>

<p>Sir Charles went on. "Yes, speaking about your coming in here
now&mdash;the very moment you crossed the threshold my
subconscious mind registered that there was something strange
about you. Your walk was furtive, and you trod softly as if you
had some nefarious and discreditable object in view. You were
coming to steal something or impose upon me for money in some
way!"</p>

<p>He roused himself up energetically in his chair. "Great Scot!
man, you don't understand the atmosphere of the consulting room
of a professional man. It is alive with queries, and deductions,
and the whys and wherefores of everything." He smiled genially.
"For instance, outside I may be absent minded and as a child in
noticing anything, but in here"&mdash;he slapped his hand upon
the desk&mdash;"I possess instincts akin to those of a beast of
the wild, and the training and experience of nearly forty years
are as searchlights that flood every corner of my mind." He shook
his finger warningly. "So beware, my friend, of a tiger in his
lair and a medical man in his own consulting room."</p>

<p>He leant back and spoke in a most kindly tone. "Now, I'll tell
you where you went wrong, sir, when you were at such pains to
reel off the tale of all those pretty symptoms of yours." He
spoke slowly and punctuated every word with his hand. "A typical
case of acute appendicitis, such as you say those medical men
said you had, does not commence with pain and tenderness in the
right side. On the contrary, its onset is ushered in by central
abdominal pain, pain in the pit of the stomach, pain reflected
from the appendix which is being distended by the inflammatory
products within." He bent forward. "Now, do you follow me, Mr.
Snooks?"</p>

<p>Larose laughed. "It is a lecture, sir," he replied, "and as it
is being given by so eminent a surgeon, I suppose I ought to feel
very grateful."</p>

<p>Sir Charles went on. "Then we have vomiting and then only when
the very sensitive lining of the abdomen, just over the appendix,
becomes irritated by the inflammatory products beneath, do we get
that dreadful pain and tenderness in the right side."</p>

<p>He laughed scornfully. "As for writhing about in your agony,
you might do that with pain in your tummy, but&mdash;goodness
gracious! with pain from an appendix, you would keep as still as
a dead man, so that by no movement should you add to your
anguish."</p>

<p>He bent forward again suddenly. "Now, no nonsense my friend.
Tell me frankly who you are and what is the information that you
considered of sufficient value to pay my professional fee of
three guineas for." He screwed up his face. "Now, are you a
detective by any chance and suspicious about me, because when two
of these mysterious bombs have gone off, I have upon each
occasion been near the place of the explosion? I know I have made
no secret of the fact that I was at the conversazione of the
Royal Society last week, as well as at Rostrellor Court the other
night." His voice was most imperious. "Come now, tell me honestly
if you are a detective."</p>

<p>And all this time Larose had been thinking quickly. He
realised that he had been outclassed in the unequal fight upon
the surgeon's own ground, and that to keep up the pretence that
he had come as a patient was no longer tenable. Besides, as a
good judge of character he was sure now he would get more out of
the eccentric individual before him by arousing his interest and
being perfectly open.</p>

<p>"I am a detective, Sir Charles," he replied, slowly, "and I
admit I am suspicious of you." He spoke very grimly. "Now what
time did you go up to your room upon the night of the entry of
those men into Lord Rostrellor's house?"</p>

<p>"Ah! that's better!" exclaimed Sir Charles gleefully, "and my
powers cannot be failing to have so quickly forced such an
admission from a gentleman with the good forehead and facial
angle that you possess. What time did I go up to bed? I can tell
you the exact moment. It was five minutes past one and I was the
last to ascend the stairs." He nodded. "A courting couple had
gone up just before me. They had been sitting in the conservatory
in the dark and he had kissed her for the first time." He smiled.
"At least, I suppose it was for the first time, because I was
just behind them and heard her say: 'Oh! you shouldn't have done
that,' which, if I remember aright, is always what a woman does
say upon such an occasion."</p>

<p>Larose thought of the episode of Angela and Croupin in the
conservatory, and could not for the moment suppress a smile. But
he was grim and stern again almost at once, and asked: "And what
can you tell me about this man Guildford?"</p>

<p>"He was a solicitor once," replied Sir Charles promptly, "but
fourteen years ago was sentenced to five years imprisonment and
struck off the rolls. Since then he has ostensibly carried on a
business as an estate agent in Mile End Road, but in reality he
is supposed to have been receiver of stolen goods, No. 1, for
this great city of London." His eyes twinkled. "All this I read
in the newspapers this morning."</p>

<p>Larose frowned angrily. "But you have known him before, Sir
Charles," he said with the utmost confidence. He drew a bow at a
venture. "We are sure of that."</p>

<p>Sir Charles sniffed contemptuously. "Bluff, sir, bluff." His
eyes blazed. "I, consorting with a receiver of stolen goods! I, a
gentleman, sir, and the eleventh baronet of my line!" His tone
was icy cold. "Who told you so?"</p>

<p>Larose avoided the question. "Well, you admit you were in the
hall at Rostrellor Court a bare ten minutes before the house was
entered through the front door, and my opinion is you opened that
door for them."</p>

<p>"And that opinion, my friend," returned the baronet dryly, "is
of as much value as that other one of yours when you thought you
were suffering from appendicitis,"&mdash;he sneered&mdash;"and
when two eminent practitioners from Adelaide arrived so
opportunely to confirm the diagnosis." He rose up from his chair.
"And that is all the time I can give." He bowed. "I will waive
the matter of the fee, but still I think it would be a gracious
act upon your part to bring round some flowers or a box of
chocolates for my nurse. She is a nice girl, and would appreciate
either." He lowered his voice to a stage whisper. "Offer to take
her to the talkies and then you could pump her about me. You have
my full permission. Oh! one moment," he added quickly. "May I
have the pleasure of learning what is your real name?"</p>

<p>"Snooks," replied Larose gravely, "a very good name, and a
most eminent gentleman of this city thinks so, too."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed Sir Charles merrily, "and that is the first
score you've made since you came into this room."</p>

<p>"Most unbalanced in his mind," muttered Larose when he was out
in the street again, "but clever&mdash;deuced clever." He grew
hot with the recollection. "Really, I never felt such a fool
before in all my life." He nodded. "But I'm very inclined to
think he may be one of the Terror. He tells everyone he has not
long to live and in that case he is just the type to run amok
whilst he does." He nodded again. "Anyhow, he is my mark now and
I ought soon to be able to link him up with Bascoigne or
Guildford somehow."</p>

<p><br>
THAT night about 8 o'clock Sir Charles was sitting in a very
despondent attitude at his desk. The afternoon had been one of
great disappointment, for Dr. Pitcher either could not, or would
not, produce an old man who was likely to be benefited by any
operation and the great surgeon had been much annoyed. He would,
however, have been more annoyed still had he been aware of what
was passing in the doctor's mind.</p>

<p>Dr. Pitcher had not at all liked the look of his old friend,
and, moreover, had formed the decided opinion that the latter was
now almost bordering upon the mental. Sir Charles had been very
evasive as to why he was so anxious to operate upon someone, and
all he had seemed to want was to get one of the inmates of the
Seaman's Home under his care upon any excuse whatsoever.</p>

<p>Sir Charles heaved a great sigh, and taking up his pen,
commenced to write.</p>

<p>"The brave man has no fear of death, and it is only a
contemplation of the physical distress of dying that renders the
thought of his passing distasteful. The common herd, who neither
think nor reason, apart from the fantastic bogies of their
imagination, fear death so much because they die alone. Were a
mass extinction of all mankind to loom suddenly before the world,
the elderly and the aged, for whom the grosser pleasures of youth
have lost their savour, would mind much less that their days were
numbered. It is the road that is lonely that terrifies with its
shadows."</p>

<p>He heard a ring at the front door bell, and put down his pen
with an uneasy frown. A minute later his butler appeared and
announced that a gentleman wanted to see him.</p>

<p>"He has no card, sir," went on the butler,
"but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I won't see him," broke in Sir Charles angrily. "Tell him my
evenings are my own."</p>

<p>"Very good," replied the butler, turning to leave the room.
"He said his name was Mr. Chung."</p>

<p>Sir Charles started as if he had been stung by a wasp. "Ah!"
he exclaimed instantly. "Wait, Rutter, wait. He is a Chinaman?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir Charles," was the reply, "but not a common one. He
looks very well dressed to me."</p>

<p>The baronet could hardly contain his excitement. "I'll see
him," he said quickly. "He is not a patient, and I forgot he was
going to call. Show him in at once. No"&mdash;a crafty look came
over his face&mdash;"bring in some glasses first, and the port
and brandy."</p>

<p>The butler left the room and instantly all traces of
despondency disappeared from Sir Charles's face. His eyes
sparkled and he rubbed his hands delightedly. "It is fate, fate,"
he muttered, "and the man has come at the appointed time. Elderly
or not, I will rejuvenate him, and when he passes again from
under this roof it will be with stride and strength of a young
man in the early twenties." He threw out his hands in his
excitement. "Oh! what an opportune arrival!"</p>

<p>The butler returned with what had been ordered. "Shall I show
him in, Sir Charles?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," replied the baronet, who had now taken up his pen again
and was pretending to frown over his manuscript. "I shall not be
ready for a few minutes, and then I'll fetch him myself. I
suppose he's in the morning room?"</p>

<p>The moment the butler had left the room Sir Charles lifted
himself softly out of his chair and, going to a small cupboard,
took out some little tablets from a bottle and, crushing them in
a small mortar, placed an equal portion of the powder in one of
the wine glasses and one of the tumblers upon the tray. Then with
a genial smile upon his face he went and fetched Ah Chung.</p>

<p>"Come in here, my friend," he said, ushering him into the
study. "It is much warmer, for there is a nice fire. Now sit down
and tell me what you want."</p>

<p>Ah Chung was certainly showing a good appearance, for he was
well dressed in a perfectly-fitting suit of good material, and he
carried himself with dignity, and his face was as calm and
impassive as ever.</p>

<p>"I have sought for Mr. Brown," he said, in his soft and gentle
voice, "but he is not at his house in London, and his servant
says he is not in the country either. He has gone away, and they
do not know where he is. They do not know when he will return,
and so I have come to you."</p>

<p>"And what, can I do for you, Mr. Chung?" asked Sir Charles,
most politely.</p>

<p>"I want my reward," said Ah Chung. "Mr. Brown said I should
have &pound;1000 as the profit of my share in the ammunition, and
for other things I have done."</p>

<p>"Certainly, you are entitled to it," said Sir Charles, "and I
will see that you get it."</p>

<p>"I want it now," said Ah Chung, "for in three days I sail for
my own country. I have secret news that the police are watching
me, and I do not want to meet trouble."</p>

<p>"What! You are leaving England in three days!" exclaimed Sir
Charles.</p>

<p>"The ship sails on Friday," was the reply, "and I weary for
the land of my ancestors."</p>

<p>Sir Charles appeared to consider. "But I don't know what I can
do in three days," he said slowly. "Is it absolutely necessary
you have the money before then?"</p>

<p>"I want it now," said Ah Chung, "and it must be that you give
it to me. I should want it, too, if I were not sailing,
for"&mdash;there was no threat in his tones&mdash;"I have kept a
still tongue."</p>

<p>"So have we for the matter of that," laughed Sir Charles. "It
was best for us all that no one should mention those amusing
little exhibitions you provided for us."</p>

<p>"But I know who you all are," went on Ah Chung very quietly,
"and yours, alone, is your real name. Mr. Brown is Mr. Oscar
Bascoigne, Professor Batcher is Dr. Libbeus, and as it is known
now, Mr. Mason's name is Guildford."</p>

<p>The baronet's jaw dropped, and he drew in a deep breath. Then
his voice was very stern. "So you have been an eavesdropper, Ah
Chung? You have been listening when we were in your room?"</p>

<p>Ah Chung did not attempt any denial. "The master of a house
should learn what goes on under his own roof," he said softly,
"and it was wise I should know who you were." He spoke quite
respectfully. "You shot that Lord of Burkington, Mr. Bascoigne
killed the judge and that priest, Mr. Guildford
stabbed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's enough, my friend," broke in Sir Charles, with a
hearty laugh. "I admit it all. It is as you say." He looked the
picture of merriment. "And how many people, you old rascal, have
you killed yourself? Can you remember them all?"</p>

<p>"The lives of some are of little value," said Ah Chung, "and
it is best that the foolish pass away."</p>

<p>"And I suppose what it really amounts to," said Sir Charles
dryly, "is that you have got frightened, because Guildford has
been caught."</p>

<p>"He was a weak link in the chain," sighed Ah Chung, "and his
tongue may not be silent as has been mine."</p>

<p>A long silence followed, and then Sir Charles sat up and drew
out his pass-book from a pigeon-hole in his desk. "I see I can
give you a few hundred in cash," he said after a few moments,
"and the rest you must take"&mdash;he looked inquiringly at the
Chinaman, "do you understand what bonds are&mdash;Government
bonds?"</p>

<p>"I have some myself," replied Ah Chung.</p>

<p>Sir Charles laughed. "Good! a remarkable man, I see," was his
comment. "Then I'll make the rest in bonds, and you're lucky,
because I have them here in my safe."</p>

<p>He rose up from his chair and then suddenly his eyes seemed to
fall upon the tray the butler had brought in and placed upon a
small table. "Ah! but you will have a glass of wine," he said.
"No?&mdash;then a little brandy?"</p>

<p>"I never drink when I am on business," said Ah Chung quietly,
"and I do not like the wines you have in this country."</p>

<p>Sir Charles pressed him, but he refused resolutely, and so,
with a smile masking his chagrin, the baronet took a bunch of
keys from his pocket and passed behind the Chinaman to get at the
safe.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Ah Chung received a stunning blow upon the back
of his head, and without a sound he slipped from his chair and in
two seconds was lying a huddled and inert figure upon the
carpet.</p>

<p>Sir Charles sprang at him with the ferocity of a wild beast,
drawing back his arm to strike again. But it was unnecessary, for
the Chinaman was quite unconscious and dead to all the world.</p>

<p>"The poor fool, with all his cunning!" panted Sir Charles. "He
might have gone out in quite a comfortable way, and instead he
forced me to adopt these violent means." His eyes gleamed with
maniacal fire. "And so when all seemed hopeless, my glorious
dream is coming true, for I shall make history to-night." He
paused suddenly and stood, with his finger upon his lip. "No, not
to-night. To-morrow, for I shall have a lot to arrange first. The
preliminary preparations need as much thinking out as those for a
great battle."</p>

<p>And then it would have seemed that there was no saner or more
resourceful and businesslike person in all the great city of
London than Sir Charles Carrion.</p>

<p>He went to the cupboard, and, taking a hypodermic syringe from
its case and a sterile needle from a glass tube, broke a small
glass ampoule, and gave the Chinaman an injection into one of the
veins of his arm. Then he laid him upon the sofa and covered him
over with a large rug.</p>

<p>Next he rang for the butler, and, meeting him in the hall,
told him he desired to be disturbed by no one again that night,
as he should be busy writing. He added that the visitor had gone,
and he himself had shown him out.</p>

<p>Then, with the butler back in his own quarters, Sir Charles
rang up Dr. Libbeus.</p>

<p>"I shall want you to give an anaesthetic for me to-morrow
morning at 7 sharp," he said quickly. "It is a very urgent
case."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Dr. Libbeus.</p>

<p>"Thyroid," replied sir Charles, "and don't you be a minute
late. Come straight round to the hospital door, and take care you
have all your wits about you. I shall want you for about two
hours."</p>

<p>"Seven o'clock's a ghastly time in cold weather like this,"
said the doctor, "but I'll be with you all right."</p>

<p>Then Sir Charles ordered two tins of scallops to be sent round
to the nurses' quarters; and followed it up by himself taking
them a part of a decanter of port.</p>

<p>"It's my birthday," he told the nurses with a beaming smile,
"and I remembered it only this evening. Just warm up the scallops
for about five minutes and then serve them with white sauce. They
are the most delicious shell fish I know of, and are better than
oysters every time. You can give young Mr. Benson some and a
glass of wine as well. They will do do him good." He shook his
finger warningly at them. "But mind, young ladies, not more than
two glasses for either of you. That's quite enough for any
girl."</p>

<p>"Isn't he a dear," said one nurse to the other when he had
gone. "The patients and every one simply loved him when he was at
Bart's. He was always so kind and sympathetic."</p>

<p>The following morning, long before 7 o'clock, Sir Charles was
waiting at the door to let Dr. Libbeus in, and he frowned
irritably when the latter appeared. "Almost late," he snapped.
"It's only two minutes to the hour."</p>

<p>They proceeded into the ante-room, adjoining the operating
theatre, and, washing and sterilising their hands, put on their
theatre gowns.</p>

<p>"What exactly is it you are going to do?" asked Dr. Libbeus,
who seemed heavy and in an apathetic state of mind.</p>

<p>"The operation of my life," replied Sir Charles excitedly,
"the rejuvenation of an old man. I am going to transfer to him
certain glands of a youth, and it will take thirty years off his
life."</p>

<p>"But what glands?" asked Dr. Libbeus incredulously, roused
from his apathy all at once.</p>

<p>"The thyroid, the adrenals, and the gonads," replied Sir
Charles majestically. "I would transfer the pineal as well, but I
don't think they'd stand it. It would take too long."</p>

<p>"But, good God, man!" exclaimed Dr. Libbeus aghast, "it's
murder, and the two of them will die, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will sign the death certificates," broke in Sir Charles
firmly, "one due to cerebral haemorrhage and the other to cardiac
failure." He shook his head emphatically. "But they won't die,
I'm certain. They will both get over it, and then"&mdash;his
voice rose in triumph&mdash;"my name will be remembered for
ever."</p>

<p>"And the young man," gasped Dr. Libbeus, "have you thought of
him?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I have," replied Sir Charles sternly. "He will be
able to devote all his energies to whatsoever occupation he
chooses, for I shall have saved him from the calls to the lower
nature of his youth." He gripped the doctor by the arm, and led
him towards the theatre. "Come on, it is too late now to draw
back," and Dr. Libbeus, with his will weakened by years of drug-taking, just shrugged his shoulders and gave in.</p>

<p>Sir Charles and Libbeus entered the theatre where Ah Chung lay
stretched out all ready, and drugged as a thing of death upon the
narrow operating table. There was another table, but unoccupied,
close by his side.</p>

<p>"But where are the sisters?" asked Dr. Libbeus, his hands
trembling and his mouth gaping.</p>

<p>"We shall be quite alone, my friend," laughed Sir Charles,
"for they are both indisposed and unable to come on duty." He
grinned. "They partook of tinned scallops last night, and are now
terrified they may be suffering from bad ptomaine poisoning. As a
matter of fact, however, they have been slugged with a large dose
of calomel, and they are twisting about with colicy pains." His
eyes glistened. "Now I have got everything ready, for I have been
hard at work all night. I have not had a wink of sleep."</p>

<p>"But where is the other pa&mdash;subject?" asked Dr. Libbeus,
looking round.</p>

<p>"In his bed until I want him," replied Sir Charles, "and
deeply under a basal narcotic." He went on quickly. "Now we shall
have no trouble at all. I purpose first to dissect out every
gland from this old man, but leave each one in its surroundings,
so that two snicks only with the knife will enable me to lift
them out. Then I am going to bring the boy in, remove every gland
of his in turn, and rapidly transfer them to this old man." He
drew the trolly of instruments up to the table. "Now, are you
ready?"</p>

<p>Dr. Libbeus was frowning heavily. "I don't like to have
anything to do with it," he said, "and damn you, I wish I'd never
seen you." He took up his mask reluctantly and then looked round
in a very dubious manner. "And I don't like the heat here either,
you've got the place much too hot."</p>

<p>"It's only seventy," snarled Sir Charles. "I looked at the
thermometer there, just before you came in."</p>

<p>Dr. Libbeus walked over to where he indicated, and immediately
gave a low whistle. "Whew!" he exclaimed, "but it's seventy-four
now." He raised his voice. "It's cursed dangerous with an
anaesthetic at this temperature, as you know. There's that great
risk of a spark coming from anywhere, when, as in here, now,
there's not sufficient moisture, in the air to make a proper
earthing."</p>

<p>"You needn't worry about any discharges of electricity in this
theatre," scoffed Sir Charles. "All the floor's rubbered, and the
trolly wheels, too, as you can see."</p>

<p>"But think of the inflammatory vapour that will be all round
us everywhere in five minutes!" went on the doctor impressively.
"We shall be surrounded by the highest explosive mixture
possible, seventy five of oxygen and five of ether, or
thereabouts, and I tell you I don't feel safe."</p>

<p>"Poof!" sneered Sir Charles contemptuously. "It's been used in
the theatre for years and years, and nothing's happened yet." He
jerked his head impatiently. "Get on with the anaesthetic,
man."</p>

<p>More reluctantly than ever, so it seemed, Dr. Libbeus prepared
to adjust his mask, but then, glancing down upon the operating
table, he started suddenly.</p>

<p>"But it's Ah Chung!" he exclaimed in astonishment. "Did he
give you his consent then?"</p>

<p>"Upon my word of honour," replied Sir Charles testily, "I
assure you he never made the slightest objection. Come on. Start
away, please."</p>

<p>"Well, damn you, again I say," said Dr. Libbeus sullenly, "and
whatever you do don't start jolting my trolly. In my opinion we
are as near dying as this poor devil here, and you'd better be
mumbling your prayers."</p>

<p>He adjusted his mask, however, and proceeded to administer the
anaesthetic.</p>

<p>Then minute after minute passed, and there was complete
silence in the theatre, except for the gentle hissing of the
oxygen as it issued from the cylinder to pass over the ether, and
the sharp clicking in the tray as the surgeon changed one
instrument for another.</p>

<p>"That's all ready," he said at last, "and now for the
adrenals. I'll take the left kidney first," and he proceeded to
very gently turn the patient to the position that he wanted.</p>

<p>At the same moment Dr. Libbeus made a slight movement with the
face piece he was holding over the patient's mouth and nose to
accommodate himself to the altered position of the latter's head.
The covering of the gas bag then seemed to rub upon the rubber
bag itself, for instantly&mdash;a spark was emitted, and in the
thousandth fraction of a second the operating table and all round
it was bathed in a shroud of flame. Then the ether container was
blown into fragments with a violent explosion, and two seconds
later a much more terrible one occurred, as a large bottle of
ether upon the anaesthetic trolly exploded, too.</p>

<p>The whole theatre instantly became a sheet of flame. Dr.
Libbeus was flung back with such force upon the floor that he
immediately lost consciousness, whilst Sir Charles Carrion, with
a yell of pain, darted in the direction of the door, covering his
eyes with his hands.</p>

<p>Only Ah Chung made no movement and no sound. He was quite
dead, for the vapour in his lungs had exploded also.</p>

<p>The great surgeon just failed to reach the door, and then he
crashed down, to moan and grope blindly with his hands.</p>

<p>Two awful minutes followed. Then came the sound of hurried
footfalls, and the door of the theatre was violently flung open,
and the butler, with one of the nurses close behind him, burst
in. For just a second, at the sight of the licking flames, the
butler hesitated, and then, bending his head low down, he sprang
forward and dragged his master outside. Then holding his breath,
and unmindful of their burning clothing, he next rescued Dr.
Libbeus and then the dead Chinaman.</p>

<p>All that could be done in the way of first aid was rendered,
and then the telephone was set ringing and the firemen and the
ambulance quickly arrived.</p>

<p>Dr. Libbeus died on the way to the hospital, and his body and
that of Ah Chung were soon lying side by side in the mortuary,
but Sir Charles, although terribly burnt about the head, face,
and legs, remained conscious and appeared to be quite aware of
all that was going on.</p>

<p>"No hope," he murmured faintly to the casualty officer who
bent over him. "I shall be out within a few hours, so give me
plenty of morphia and don't mess me about."</p>

<p>They asked him if he would like to say anything about how it
all happened, but he made no reply. Then he asked suddenly how
the others were, and when they tried to evade a direct answer, he
remarked with little interest. "Dead, eh?" adding after a moment,
"and a damned good thing, too."</p>

<p>Then he lapsed into semi-consciousness and no further attempts
were made to question him.</p>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br>

THE WAYS OF DEATH.</h2>

<p class="first">THE day of the explosion in the operating
theatre of Sir Charles Carrion's private hospital was a very busy
one for Scotland Yard, for it was stretching out its tentacles in
all directions.</p>

<p>It had been quite aware of the urgent operation that was going
to be performed at 7 o'clock that morning, and, moreover, that a
certain Professor Batcher, of Queen Anne's street, whose name did
not appear upon the Medical Register, was going to give the
anaesthetic. Also, it had surmised that the Chinaman who had
called at Sir Charles's private residence the previous evening at
8 o'clock, and had not been seen to come out again, was
presumably going to be the patient.</p>

<p>Of all this, too, Larose had been kept informed, for he had
waited upon the Chief Commissioner the previous afternoon, and,
expressing his profound suspicion of Sir Charles, had asked that
the latter's telephone should be listened into forthwith, and all
the great consultant's movements be kept under the closest
observation.</p>

<p>So it had happened that the arrival of two Chinamen the
previous night to the entrance to the drive leading up to Sir
Charles's house had been noted by three plain-clothes men, who
were on the watch in different parts of the road there. Then they
had seen the two Chinamen part company, one disappearing up the
drive and the other moving off for about 50 yards, to take up a
position where he could watch until his friend came out
again.</p>

<p>But the night was cold and frosty, and the waiting Chinaman
had soon not been content with just stamping his feet and
flapping his arms about to keep warm. So, instead, he had started
to take quick, sharp walks of a couple of hundred yards or so,
continually glancing back, however, to make certain that his
friend had not yet reappeared.</p>

<p>Presently then, upon one of these excursions, he had seen a
motor car swerve into a barrow and almost run over the man who
was pushing it, and in the interest of the angry quarrel that
ensued, he had allowed his attention to be engrossed for a period
that he realised all suddenly had been much longer than it should
have been. So, after glancing quickly at his watch, he had
started running back towards Sir Charles's residence. Arriving at
the entrance to the drive, he had hesitated a moment as if
doubtful what to do, and then, evidently thinking that his friend
must have come out when he was watching the car, with no more ado
he had taken himself off at once.</p>

<p>The chief of the plain-clothes men had been half inclined to
detach one of his assistants to follow him, but, then, knowing
the other Chinaman had not yet come out of the drive, and
reckoning he must be the more important of the two, had decided
it was best not to weaken his forces so early in the night, but
just let this second man go.</p>

<p>So things had been up to 7.45 the next morning, when Larose
received the news of what had just happened at Sir Charles
Carrion's place in Hampstead, and within half an hour he was on
the spot, along with a couple of men from the Yard. The ambulance
had gone off some minutes ago, but the firemen were still on
watch to make sure there was nothing continuing to smoulder among
the ruins.</p>

<p>The fire had been an easy one to put out, having been entirely
confined to the theatre and the anteroom.</p>

<p>The butler had been badly burnt about the hands in his heroic
rescues, and was in considerable pain, but, as in his master's
absence he had been always in sole charge of everything, he had
refused now to leave the premises, and so had been put to bed in
the ward by the nurses, and a local doctor called in.</p>

<p>Strict injunctions had then immediately been issued by the
latter that on no account were any pressmen or others to approach
the butler for interviews. The man was to be kept perfectly
quiet, and no strangers were to go near him.</p>

<p>But it was one thing to give this order to the two nurses, and
quite another to insist upon its enforcement to a very grim-faced
Larose, accompanied by another equally uncompromising Detective-Inspector from Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>It was not just a matter, explained Larose, of the injuries to
the butler's hands and the probable death of both doctors, in
addition to that of the Chinaman which had already occurred. It
was a matter possibly of many other deaths that had been
occurring during the last few weeks, and therefore it was vital
that the butler should give certain information at once.</p>

<p>"But, damn it all man," insisted the doctor, warmly, "I don't
feel justified in exposing my patient to any such risk. He is
suffering from bad shock as it is."</p>

<p>"And I won't add to it, I promise you, doctor," replied Larose
equally firmly. "I needn't be with him three minutes. I just want
to find out who that Chinaman was, and you shall stop my
questioning any moment if you think I am upsetting your patient
too much."</p>

<p>The doctor continued to object, but Larose handled him
tactfully, and so at length he gave way. "But mind you," he said
sternly, "you've promised to stop the moment I tell you and I
shall expect you to adhere to your word. Remember, too, that
apart from his physical suffering, the man is naturally in a
condition of great distress about his master."</p>

<p>Upon being taken into the ward, Larose found the butler
looking desperately ill, and he did not wonder the doctor had
preferred no one should come near him. The man's eyes were
wandering blankly round, and it almost seemed that he was not in
full possession of his senses.</p>

<p>Fearful that at any moment the doctor might order him away,
Larose at once bent down, and laying his hand upon the butler's
shoulder in order to make sure of attracting his attention came
at once to the point.</p>

<p>"Was that Chinaman who was upon the operating table this
morning," he asked, "the same one who called last night?"</p>

<p>The butler appeared to be startled by the question, and then
fixing his eyes upon Larose, stared and stared, but all the time
as if quite unaware that he was being spoken to.</p>

<p>Larose repeated the question very quietly, and then the butler
awoke at once to life and understanding.</p>

<p>"That's what I don't know, sir," he said quickly, "for all
Chinamen seem alike to me." He looked very troubled. "And I'm
very puzzled about the whole business. The Chinaman who called
last night wasn't in the house 20 minutes, and the bell never
rang again." He shook his head. "Yet, this morning Sir Charles
was operating upon another Chinaman who somehow had arrived
during the night."</p>

<p>"Did you let the first Chinaman out yourself?" asked Larose,
holding his breath to await the reply.</p>

<p>"No, sir, Sir Charles let him out," said the butler. "He rang
for me and told me so in the hall. He also said he didn't want to
be disturbed again, for he was going to be busy with his writing
until late at night." He shook his head. "He had said nothing to
any of us about this early operation, Although directly I got
back into the kitchen I heard him on the 'phone, and think now he
must have been arranging about it."</p>

<p>"Then you don't know anything about this visitor who called
last night?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"No, sir, nothing at all," replied the butler, "for I'd never
seen him before. He said, however, that his name was Chung."</p>

<p>Larose's heart gave a big jump, but then, noting out of the
tail of his eye that the doctor was now jerking his head in the
direction of the door as if to intimate that the questioning had
gone on quite long enough, he asked quickly: "And were the
Professor and Sir Charles great friends?"</p>

<p>"Only just recently," replied the butler, his voice now
obviously beginning to weaken, "for up to about three months ago
the professor had never come here. But he's been here a lot
lately, for they've been making experiments together in the
laboratory." He closed his eyes.
"Something&mdash;to&mdash;do&mdash;with&mdash;ammunition
&mdash;Sir Charles&mdash;told&mdash;me&mdash;once."</p>

<p>The doctor plucked Larose sharply by the arm. "That'll do," he
said. "Not another word, now," and Larose with his pulse beating
quickly, was almost pushed out of the ward.</p>

<p>Thanking the doctor he next proceeded to interview the head
nurse, and the mystery of everything at once deepened. She told
him of how she and the other nurse, along with the only patient
in the hospital, had suddenly become ill after eating some tinned
scallops Sir Charles had sent them, and how she had been obliged
to call him in the night; how she had found him up and dressed,
and how he had given them all sleeping draughts, but had said
nothing about any operation. Then, how finally she had been
awakened by the noise of the explosion in the theatre, and what
happened after.</p>

<p>Larose listened thoughtfully, and then, having asked a few
more questions, said he was going to the laboratory.</p>

<p>"But you'll want poor Sir Charles's keys," the nurse said
tearfully, "for it's always kept locked," and she produced a
bunch of keys that had been in the surgeon's pockets when his
clothes had been cut away.</p>

<p>Then Larose, accompanied by Detective-Inspector Martin, made
his way round to the laboratory, an isolated building about a
hundred yards from the house away among the trees, and their eyes
opened in amazement the moment they were inside.</p>

<p>"Explosives!" ejaculated Larose incredulously. "Good God! and
someone's been making bombs here!"</p>

<p>And certainly, even to the most untrained eye there would have
been something suspicious about the contents of the large room.
Huge carboys of heavy looking liquids, nitric and sulphuric
acids, and glycerine, long black packages with broad danger
stripes of red down their sides, long lengths of fusing and
fulminate caps of all descriptions. Then there were iron cases of
varying sizes that looked like bombs, all waiting to be
filled.</p>

<p>Inspector Martin whistled. "It's like a young arsenal," he
exclaimed excitedly, and then seeing an innocent-looking attache
case lying against the wall, he started to pick it up to examine
what was inside. But he did not shift it more than half an inch
from the floor, and then with a very white face he put it softly
back in its place. "As heavy as lead, and perhaps all ready to go
off!" he whispered. "Gosh! if I'd only let it fall!"</p>

<p>Making arrangements for the laboratory to be guarded, Larose
gave a lightning survey over Sir Charles's study, and then,
locking and sealing the door, proceeded at once to the hospital
to which the injured men had been taken.</p>

<p>There he learnt Sir Charles Carrion was in a semi-conscious
state, and likely to pass away any moment, and that Professor
Batcher was already dead and in the mortuary with the Chinaman.
He examined both the bodies, but was no wiser in consequence, for
they were both strangers to him. He arranged, however, that their
finger prints should be taken at once, and hurried down to
Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>Then, after a very brief interview with the Chief
Commissioner, by half past 10 he was being driven down to
Limehouse with a search-warrant to go through the premises of Ah
Chung. He was accompanied by Inspector Martin, who was well
acquainted with the Chinese quarter in the East End, and two
plain-clothes men.</p>

<p>He was hoping by acting thus expeditiously to get to Ah
Chung's house before any of its inmates could have become aware
of the Chinaman's death, but, as it so happened, although he was
not to learn it that morning, he was just one hour too late.</p>

<p>It was Ho Ling who had accompanied Ah Chung to Hampstead the
previous evening, and, being most uneasy that his relation had
not returned when he himself had arrived back home about half-past 10, he had sat up all night to wait for him. Then when
morning came and there was still no sign of the missing man, he
had become very alarmed, and by 7 o'clock had set off to try to
find out what had happened.</p>

<p>He had arrived at Sir Charles's just at the very moment when
the ambulance was coming out of the drive and, standing among the
crowd who were being kept back by a policeman, he had heard a
butcher-boy tell a woman that there had been a dreadful fire, and
two doctors and a Chink had been burnt to death. "Them were their
bodies," the boy had added, "that the ambulance has just took
away."</p>

<p>Quite certain that the Chinaman could have only been Ah Chung,
he had waited a few minutes to overmaster his horror before
approaching the policeman, who had then at once confirmed the
facts. Then with no delay he had speeded back to the Causeway and
made known what had happened.</p>

<p>Ah Chung's two young wives had immediately started to wail,
but they had been sternly repressed in the callous oriental
manner, and then a conference of all the relations of Ah Chung
had been held.</p>

<p>Naturally, they were all staggered at the death of their
compatriot, for they could hazard no guesses even as to how it
had come to happen. But they quickly masked their grief and
ceased all speculations for the moment realising that they must
set to work at once, for there were certain things of which it
was desirable the authorities should not become aware.</p>

<p>They had no reason to expect a police-raid, but at the same
time they thought it wisest, as far as possible to be prepared
for one.</p>

<p>So the two wives were promptly bundled over to the lodging-house next door, and all of Ah Chung's valuables that could be
found, as well as certain other things, were laid hands upon and
transferred to the same quarter.</p>

<p>They would have liked to dismantle everything in the big shed,
but that they knew would have been a matter of at least two or
three days, and to be caught in the act of doing it, they
realised, would have looked very suspicious. So they decided to
meet everything with blank looks and the attitude that they know
nothing of Ah Chung's affairs, and with that end in view only two
old men were left upon the premises in which the marine store was
situated, all the others betaking themselves off to the adjoining
houses.</p>

<p>And they were only just in time, for not a quarter of an hour
later a police car drove up and stopped in front of Ah Chung's.
It contained four passengers besides the driver, and the former
at once sprang out and entered the marine store of the dead
man.</p>

<p>"We're police," announced Inspector Martin curtly to an old
Chinaman who came to the door of Ah Chung's store. "Who are
you?"</p>

<p>The old Chinaman seemed in no way alarmed. "Me Wen Loo," he
replied softly. "Me shop-man for Ah Chung."</p>

<p>"Who else is on the premises?" asked the inspector
sharply.</p>

<p>"Another shop-man who help in the house," replied Wen Loo. He
looked over his shoulder. "He is here. He is Fo Sin."</p>

<p>"Well, I've bad news for you," said the inspector at once,
dropping his sharp tone and speaking very kindly. "A terrible
accident has happened to your master, and he died just before 8
o'clock this morning."</p>

<p>"He will be back velly soon," said Wen Loo, with no expression
on his face. "He gone out last night for little vile."</p>

<p>"But I tell you he's dead man," snapped the inspector. "I've
just come away from his dead body."</p>

<p>"He say he come back," insisted Wen Loo. "He have business to
do somewhere," and then it was only by much reiteration that the
two Chinamen could be made to realise what had happened.</p>

<p>But they expressed no horrified comments, and just stood
regarding the inspector as if he had imparted news of a most
casual nature.</p>

<p>"Well, I've a search warrant to go through the house," the
inspector went on briskly to the elder Chinaman, "and you'd
better come with me. I've got all the keys that were found in Mr.
Chung's clothes."</p>

<p>Leaving one of the plain-clothes men behind in the shop they
proceeded to go through the rooms one by one. The upper ones were
well and even richly furnished, and Larose expressed his
astonishment at finding so much luxury in so poor a quarter.</p>

<p>"Pooh! that's nothing," exclaimed the Inspector. "Some of
these Chinks down here are worth a lot of money. They get hold of
it somehow and"&mdash;he nodded significantly&mdash;"we'd often
like to know how."</p>

<p>Presently they came to a large bedroom even more comfortably
furnished still, and the inspector sniffed hard. "But this is a
woman's bedroom," he said sharply, turning to Wen Loo. "It reeks
of scent. Now who sleeps here?"</p>

<p>"No one for to-day," replied the Chinaman softly, "but Mr.
Chung have visitors sometimes. Two ladies were here just a little
vile ago." His face was quite expressionless. "They vere his
aunts, he say."</p>

<p>The detectives found nothing of much interest to them in the
house, except a number of photographs of finger-marks, which
Larose at once thrust into his pocket. But in the yard when they
had unlocked the door of the big shed and switched on the lights,
they had hardly taken a glance round before they were nodding to
each other significantly.</p>

<p>"A rat pit!" commented the Inspector sharply. "All the
paraphernalia for cock-fights, too, and"&mdash;he examined the
big cages quickly&mdash;"if I am not very much mistaken, from the
amount of dried blood here, fights between large animals have
been staged here as well." He turned sternly to Wen Loo. "Who
come here?"</p>

<p>But the Chinaman for the first time now betrayed surprise. "Me
not know," he said, with his puzzled eyes roaming round and
round. "Me not been here before."</p>

<p>"You liar!" snarled the inspector angrily. "Don't you tell us
that. You know everything that's being going on here."</p>

<p>"Me not been in here," insisted the Chinaman firmly. "It is Ah
Chung's business, and he talk never what he does. No one know
much about him."</p>

<p>And that was the attitude with which the detectives were
received in the adjoining houses on either side.</p>

<p>Indeed, no one seemed to know anything much about Ah Chung. He
was a man of mystery, and avoided by all! No one liked him, for
it was thought he was in the pay of the police, and he quarrelled
with every one! One Chinaman, indeed, Ho Ling by name, who kept
the bird and live stock shop, had not spoken to him for years!
Also, it was the same with Ming Chow, who kept the lodging house
on the other side. Ah Chung was his enemy, and he would have put
him wrong with the police if he could! He was an evil man, and
dangerous to have any dealings with!</p>

<p>Then when they were asked if they ever heard of Sir Charles
Carrion or Mr. Sheldon-Brown they all looked as innocent as
little children. No, they had never heard of either of them, but
of Mason, the estate agent, they had of course heard. They had
read all about him in the paper, and he was going to be hanged.
He was supposed to have killed their neighbour, Voisin, too, the
barber who lived at the back. No, they none of them knew Voisin
to speak to, but most of them knew him by sight. He drank much
whisky and was often seen coming out of 'The Bargeman's Friend.'
The detective spent about two hours questioning them, and then
drove away, leaving, however, the two plain-clothes men in Ah
Chung's store.</p>

<p>"But I'll go back there in an hour or so with an interpreter
and more help," nodded Inspector Martin with an unpleasant
scowl.</p>

<p>"Do you think they've been telling us the truth?" asked Larose
thoughtfully. "It seems to me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The truth, sir!" exclaimed the inspector scornfully. "Great
Jupiter, no!" He grinned. "We've been listening to a pack of lies
from the very first moment we arrived, and if we only knew it
every man jack of them is a relation of Ah Chung." He looked very
amused. "Why, probably that Ho Ling is Ah Chung's brother, and
it's quite possible one of the old Chinks there is his dad."</p>

<p><br>
LATE that night Larose called again at the hospital where Sir
Charles had been taken, and learnt that the baronet was in
extremis and likely to pass away any moment. Then, after a long
argument with the resident medical officer, he was allowed to
enter the ward and approach the bed of the dying man.</p>

<p>Sir Charles's head was all swathed in bandages, and only one
ear and a portion of his mouth were visible.</p>

<p>Larose bent down and whispered very quietly. "I'm Larose,
Gilbert Larose."</p>

<p>Then to his great surprise Sir Charles spoke back instantly,
softly, but quite distinctly. "Oh! you are, are you?" he said as
if with no astonishment. A ghost of a chuckle gurgled behind the
bandaged lips. "Well, no one can do me any harm now, for I put on
the black cap for myself when I came in here, hours ago." He
sighed. "I'll be on that mortuary slab before morning."</p>

<p>"And we know all about you," whispered on Larose, "all you
have done, and Dr. Libbeus and Guildford and Oscar
Bascoigne."</p>

<p>"Very interesting," commented Sir Charles, with some faint
amusement, "but the curtain is falling much too early. I was only
just getting into my stride."</p>

<p>Larose made a grimace of dismay, for he had thought that if
the baronet spoke at all it would be in a very different
vein.</p>

<p>"Well, as some atonement," he said very solemnly, "tell me how
we can prove that Oscar Bascoigne killed Sir John Lorraine.
Bascoigne is the last of you four, and we want direct evidence
against him."</p>

<p>"Then you won't get it from me," whispered Sir Charles very
faintly, "for, ever since time was, no Carrion has been known to
betray anyone"&mdash;he chuckled&mdash;"except perhaps a few
women." He sighed. "No, I'll die a gentleman."</p>

<p>"You won't tell me anything, then, about Oscar Bascoigne?"
asked Larose after a short silence.</p>

<p>"No, nothing," was the scarcely audible reply, "except that
he's hot after Fairfax and will get him sure as hell." His voiced
began to trail away. "Go&mdash;away&mdash;please.
I&mdash;want&mdash;to&mdash;die&mdash;in&mdash;peace."</p>

<p>Larose tiptoed softly from the room, and learnt next day that
when the chimes of midnight were sounding the baronetcy of the
Carrions became extinct.</p>

<p><br>
ABOUT a week later the Chief Commissioner of Police was
arguing with Gilbert Larose, and, as usual, the two were not
seeing eye to eye.</p>

<p>"I admit, Mr. Larose," said the Commissioner, "that there is
not the slightest doubt that three out of the four of that
dreadful gang have been laid by the heels. Two of them are dead
and buried and the third will assuredly hang, but"&mdash;and he
shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"upon whatsoever charge can we
arraign this fourth man, Sheldon-Brown, or Oscar Bascoigne,
whichever he may be?"</p>

<p>"If there be any value in circumstantial evidence," replied
Larose doggedly, "we have enough to hang him twice over. That he
had committed two murders himself we can be sure
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We have no witnesses," broke in the Commissioner.</p>

<p>"But we have the motives," insisted Larose testily, "and upon
both occasions we can prove he has been upon the scene of the
crime at the very hour when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We have not the motives," cried the Commissioner,
interrupting for the second time, "and we shall never have them
until we can satisfy a stolid British jury that in the finger-print department of Scotland Yard it is always possible for the
finger-prints and descriptions of one, Thomas Smith, to become
changed to those of another, Albert Brown." He leant forward and
spoke most kindly. "Look here, my friend. As you say, there is a
large amount of circumstantial evidence suggesting that Sheldon-Brown was a member of the gang and the actual murderer of Sir
John Lorraine and Archdeacon Lendon, but"&mdash;he spoke very
solemnly&mdash;"there is little value in all this circumstantial
evidence until it be supplemented by some direct evidence as
well. You understand?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded grimly. "Yes," he grunted, "it is necessary for
me to catch him cutting Brown's throat before you will be
prepared to consider he may have cut Smith's."</p>

<p>The Commissioner smiled. "That's it, exactly," he replied. "A
little direct evidence and the value of the circumstantial kind
will be increased a hundredfold."</p>

<p>He looked up at the almanac upon his desk. "Now the trial of
Guildford comes off in exactly three weeks, and the killing of
that footman will be the only charge we are bringing against
him." He looked very sharply at Larose. "We might have brought a
lot of kudos to the Yard by arraigning him upon the other charges
as well, but we have yielded to you there."</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Larose, "and what good would it have done us by
exposing our hands? We should have gained nothing by it and only
warned Oscar Bascoigne"&mdash;he looked sternly at the
Commissioner&mdash;"what we know about him." He sighed. "But good
God! How easy it would have been to bring home those other
murders to Guildford!"</p>

<p>"Yes," exclaimed the Commissioner with a ring of triumph in
his voice, "because we should then have had this proven murder to
give a background to the other charges we are bringing against
him." His face beamed. "That is all we want about this Sheldon-Brown, sir. Catch him fairly out in another crime and he'll break
like a rotten stick in our hands."</p>

<p>A short silence followed, and then Larose got to his feet.</p>

<p>"Then you absolutely refuse to tackle this Sheldon-Brown," he
asked, "upon the evidence I have produced?"</p>

<p>"I do," replied the Commissioner, emphatically. He smiled
kindly. "But don't give it up yet, Mr. Larose, I pray you, for
remember you are the man that never fails," and with an answering
smile, in which, however, there was not much warmth, Larose left
the room.</p>

<h2><a id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br>

LAROSE BAITS HIS TRAP.</h2>

<p class="first">A WEEK went by after the conversation between
the Chief Commissioner of Police and Gilbert Larose, and then one
crisp November morning the latter arrived at Mortimer Fairfax's
chambers in Lincoln Inn's Fields, and asked to see the K.C.</p>

<p>He was not kept waiting long, and then directly he was ushered
into Fairfax's room, the latter remarked drily: "More sentences
of death, I suppose, Mr. Larose, and the day of execution getting
nearer!"</p>

<p>Larose nodded solemnly. "I had not much to go upon when I
warned you last time, sir," he said, "but now I have obtained
evidence of a concrete nature, and I assure you the danger is
very great."</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Fairfax, with his eyes and mouth smiling, but
with his face grown an ugly grey. "I am quite interested."</p>

<p>"But no harm will come to you," smiled back Larose, "if you
meet the situation bravely and make it possible for us to get
hold of your would-be assassin before the sentence can be carried
out."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" exclaimed the K.C., "then the time of which you
spoke has arrived, and I am to hand over my poor carcase as the
bait for your trap."</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly," laughed Larose, "but of course we want
you to be on the spot as the star attraction. We'll take care,
however, that no one gets near you."</p>

<p>"But what's this extra evidence you've got," asked the K.C.,
"that this scoundrel is really coming after me to take my
life?"</p>

<p>"A little less than a fortnight ago," replied Larose, speaking
very slowly, "one of Bascoigne's confederates died as the result
of an accident. He would not give us the information we required,
but I had speech with him just before he died, and his last words
were that Bascoigne was upon your trail," and then Larose
proceeded to relate quickly the greater part of all that had
taken place, since that afternoon when they had first met at Mrs
Fox-Drummond's in Surbiton.</p>

<p>"But good Lord!" exclaimed Fairfax, looking very amazed, "how
on earth you have managed to keep all this from the public I
don't know." He clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth.
"And fancy Carrion being one of the band of madmen! I have known
him for more than twenty years and the whole business would be
inconceivable if it were not public property that he was almost a
homicidal lunatic when he was put away about eight years ago." He
looked thoughtfully at Larose. "But that finding of the scored
newspaper in Bascoigne's desk doesn't certainly look too good for
me, quite apart from what Carrion told you!"</p>

<p>"No, it doesn't," agreed Larose significantly, "and what I've
witnessed this past week makes it much worse."</p>

<p>"Go on," smiled the K.C. "Let's have the whole issue. I'll
have to go through it, I see."</p>

<p>But there was no answering smile upon Larose's face and he
started to tell his story. "I've been shadowing Bascoigne for six
days now," he said, "and five of them I have spent in
Crowborough." He punctuated his words with his hand. "On Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday he was in the garden nearly all
day, practising at a miniature rifle-range he's got
there"&mdash;the K.C. made an uncomfortable grimace
here&mdash;"then on Saturday morning he went off in his car, and
later I made my way over to Ingatestone. I sat among some bushes
in a field opposite your house, and during the afternoon saw him
drive by twice. He drove very slowly, and upon both occasions
stared up towards your house. I also saw him go by once, on
Sunday morning, and then he was back at Crowborough the same
evening. I left him there last night."</p>

<p>"Hum!" remarked the K.C. "Practising in his garden with a
rifle was he?" He grinned. "What sort of a shot is he?"</p>

<p>"Not too bad," replied Larose. "His rifle is a small .22 and
his target is always placed at thirty yards."</p>

<p>"Just about the distance from the garden wall to the middle of
my dining-room," commented the K.C. dryly, "and I always sit at
the head of the table near the window." He looked sharply at
Larose. "Now tell me exactly what you suggest. Do you want to
catch the fellow in the very act of taking a pot shot at me with
his .22?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," replied Larose warmly, "but we do want to
catch him in your vicinity in suspicious circumstances, with a
weapon, a fire-arm preferably, ready to take the vengeance we are
sure he has all along been waiting to exact." He went on quickly.
"You see we have most definite proof that there were two men
particularly upon whom he might want to take revenge, you and Sir
John Lorraine, and we can show, definitely again, that he was in
the vicinity of the Judge when he was killed. So if we can now
catch him prowling about your house and armed with some weapon of
destruction, then it will greatly add to the weight of the
circumstantial evidence that it was he who killed Sir John
Lorraine."</p>

<p>"All right," nodded Fairfax curtly. "I'll take it on. Now tell
me exactly what you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"Firstly," replied Larose, "let me take this notice to the
office of the 'Morning Post' for insertion tomorrow." He smiled,
"The 'Morning Post' has always been the paper that both Bascoigne
and Sheldon-Brown read."</p>

<p>The K.C. took the notice he held out and read. "Mr. Mortimer
Fairfax, K.C., is suffering from the aftereffects of a bad cold
and has been ordered by his medical adviser to remain, for a few
days at his country residence in Ingatestone."</p>

<p>"All right," he said, "now what next?"</p>

<p>"Go down the day after to-morrow," replied Larose, "and make a
little house-party of it. Ask Mrs. Fox-Drummond and Miss Lendon
and my friend de Choisy-Hautville, among others."</p>

<p>The K.C. grinned. "You vouch for this French chap, I suppose?"
he asked. "He's going great guns with Angela."</p>

<p>"Certainly!" replied Larose, "he's as straight as a die now.
He had a bit of a wild youth, but that's all over and done with,
and he's a very fine fellow."</p>

<p>"Well, how are you going to protect me?" asked the K.C.
sharply. "I tell you I'm not a bit afraid, but it's an
uncomfortable position to be in, and I expect reasonable
precautions to be taken."</p>

<p>"And they shall be taken," replied Larose instantly. "I
promise you you shall be so safeguarded that the man will never
be able to get near you." He nodded. "I spent all yesterday
studying the lie of the land about your place, and the house
lends itself admirably to a scheme of protection. It is only
about 200 yards from the high road, it stands by itself upon
rising ground, and can be seen from all parts of the town! The
land behind it slopes up for about 300 yards to those little
hills from which you get a view in every direction." He looked
very confident. "Things could not be better."</p>

<p>"Yes!" commented the K.C. dryly, "and those hills would be an
ideal place for a man firing high-velocity cartridges, even if
they were only .22's."</p>

<p>"But Bascoigne is not a rifleman," replied Larose quickly,
"and he's never been known to possess a rifle until he bought
this one in Crowborough about three months ago. He buys all his
cartridges there, too, and that is how I come to know he is using
long .22s." He raised his hand. "Now listen Mr. Fairfax and I'll
explain to you exactly what I want to do."</p>

<p><br>
SO it was that two days later quite a merry little house-party
assembled in the old Manor House in Ingatestone. There happened
to be a considerable amount of influenza in the city at that time
and excuses were easily found that a few days in the country
would brace them all up, and although it was November they were
sure they would have anything but an uninteresting time.</p>

<p>They intended to explore lovely little, and still almost
unknown, villages, whose very names carried one back to medieval
times. Their host would provide unlimited rabbit-shooting
whenever the weather was fine. There would be always bridge when
it was too wet to go out, and they had enough musical talent
among them to make up quite a good orchestra when anyone wanted
to dance.</p>

<p>And the company assembled there, too, was so very interesting.
There was an old Admiral Harcourt who had such a fund of good
stories, and who made everybody so deliriously terrified, because
they never knew what he was going to say next. There was Monsieur
de Choisy-Hautville, a descendant, it was whispered, of the
Bourbon kings, who could play like a virtuoso upon his violin and
wrap the room in silence for many moments after his playing had
died away. Then there was a dear old man from Australia who was a
thought reader and could hypnotise people and do a lot of uncanny
things.</p>

<p>Then there was Mrs. Fox-Drummond, whose men-servants and whose
maid-servants had been lent, almost it seemed, by the score. She
was the hostess, and discreetly and with a very light hand,
chaperoned a bevy of delightfully pretty girls.</p>

<p>There were some well-known beauties among these girls, too;
Margot Devine, who had been regarded as one of the most charming
debutantes of the past season; Angela Lendon, who could have sat
to an artist for an angel from Paradise, because she was so happy
and so much in love, and Selina Courtland, who, as every one
knew, would be featured in the forthcoming greatest screening of
all time, 'The World's Desire.'</p>

<p>But above all surely there was the host, the genial, hearty
Mortimer Fairfax, the fighter, who a hundred times and more upon
behalf of some poor trembling prisoner, had faced so
unflinchingly a hostile judge and jury, and who now, although
only a few of them there knew it, was facing equally bravely the
lurking figure of an assassin he might never see, and the whining
of a bullet he might never hear.</p>

<p>It was indeed a strange gathering, symbolising at once the
happiness of life, the menace of foul and dreadful death, and the
scaffold of the Law hidden only such a little way away.</p>

<p>The house-party had all arrived upon the Thursday afternoon,
and towards dusk upon that day, a car coming from the direction
of Chelmsford pulled up to a small shop in the little town of
Ingatestone, and its driver getting out he made some few light
purchases of tobacco and sweets.</p>

<p>He was quite a pleasant-looking man, and while the woman of
the shop was getting him his change asked chattily who lived in
the big house upon the right, just coming into the town.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mortimer Fairfax, the great King's Counsel," replied the
woman, "but unfortunately for the town he doesn't often stay
here. However, he's arrived to-day, and with quite a big house-party, too, for I must have counted eight or nine cars turn up
his road since noon."</p>

<p>"Good gracious! but where does he get his staff from?" asked
the man, appearing very interested.</p>

<p>"Oh! his cousin, Mrs. Fox-Drummond sends them," replied the
woman. "A brakeload of them came along yesterday and two of the
gentlemen were drinking at the King's Head last night." She
smiled. "They're just human, like the men who work in the
fields."</p>

<p>On Friday the day was mild and bright and the house-party had
quite a sporting time, for 30 pairs of rabbits were available for
distribution among Mr. Fairfax's tenants.</p>

<p>Saturday was equally fine and most of the young people drove
over for lunch to Felixstowe, returning home soon after five,
just as a mist was beginning to roll up from the sea.</p>

<p>"But it's not going to be much," remarked Admiral Harcourt
loudly, "and the summer-house will still be available for
courting couples, after dinner, if the moon's not too
strong."</p>

<p>He was at once informed that his ideas were disgraceful and he
could go by himself to the summer-house if he wanted to, for 18
tickets had been taken for the Talkies at the Town Hall, and he
was going to be left to ruminate upon his sins, alone.</p>

<p>The old man from Australia who could read thoughts was very
troubled in his mind and listened to the badinage with deaf ears,
for as Detective Inspector Larose, fog was the one thing he
dreaded. He had four men stationed in the garden and there was
some one watching night and day upon one of the hills. But what
good were any of them if a dense fog descended, and how could he
then guarantee the safety of the K.C.?</p>

<p>He remembered the bold way Lord Buckington had been murdered,
with his assassin smashing the glass of the dining-room window
and then coolly firing through the broken pane.</p>

<p>But he was taking all the precautions that he could, he told
himself, for when the party would have left for the talkies, the
lights in all rooms were to be left on, so if any one were
prowling about outside he would be very puzzled to determine in
which particular room was sheltered the master of the house.</p>

<p>Dinner was over about half-past seven, and then, attired
warmly to face the short walk into the town, the young people
stood about in pairs waiting until every one was ready.</p>

<p>Larose slipped out of a side door and in the half light of the
mist made his way round outside the low garden wall, towards
where he could look across the garden on to the lights of the
dining-room, and the other living room of the house.</p>

<p>The mist was not very thick and the moon, nearly at his full,
was making determined efforts to break through. He whispered a
few words in passing to two of the men who were lying well-rugged, behind some bushes, and then gaining the position he
wanted, stood leaning against a big tree which was almost
touching the wall itself.</p>

<p>And at that very moment Oscar Bascoigne, with the tread of a
tiger, was parking a bicycle among a small clump of trees not ten
paces from where Larose stood. He was carrying a small rifle
under his arm.</p>

<p>A breeze had sprung up from the sea and the mist was clearing
rapidly, rising in great wreaths and rolling up over the
hills.</p>

<p>Larose bent over the wall, and, giving way to his thoughts,
wondered, as he had so often done before, why the good things and
the foul things of life came to be so intermingled.</p>

<p>The young people going into the town were evidently almost
ready, for he could hear them so plainly that he knew the hall
door must be now open.</p>

<p>He could catch the lilt of their happy laughter, with the
rapture of the promise of life that ran as a beautiful refrain in
the music of their voices as they called to one another. He could
picture their sparkling eyes and the soft pressure of their hands
in the darkness, the snuggling close together as they stood arm
in arm&mdash;and here was he clutching to a deadly little pistol
and hoping with as deep a hope as he had ever hoped before that
some one was not far away and bent that night on murder.</p>

<p>A puff of wind came up from the road below, whisking away the
last wreaths of mist, and the moon came out in all its glory.</p>

<p>Suddenly then, in a dim, subconscious sort of way, Larose
became aware of a faint sound, as of some one breathing close
beside him. He did not take it in for a second or two, but then
with a choking feeling in his throat he stepped back a pace to
see if any one were sheltered behind the other side of the
tree.</p>

<p>Then his heart almost stopped beating in his surprise, for not
three feet away from him stood the man who had been in his
thoughts for so many weeks&mdash;Oscar Bascoigne, the ex-convict
and assassin.</p>

<p>For just the fraction of a second he did not take it in, and
then with a yell of triumph he moved to spring forward. But
Bascoigne was just that fraction of a second before him, and the
ex-convict's fist struck like a sledge-hammer between his eyes,
throwing him back with great violence on to the ground.</p>

<p>Then Bascoigne was upon him like a stroke of lightning, and
kneeling across his chest, with one hand he gripped his throat
and with the other tugged fiercely at a big-headed hammer that he
had got in his pocket. But the greater part of the hammer had
been sawn away and in its truncated condition it stuck across the
pocket.</p>

<p>He managed to pull it out at last, however, and was just
raising it to crash down upon the forehead of Larose, when he
suddenly heard an angry shout close near and, jerking up his
head, saw not fifteen paces away a lithe and supple figure
darting towards him.</p>

<p>He dropped the hammer instantly and, springing to his feet,
made a jump for the rifle that he had left upon the wall. Then
came the sharp click of the ejector, the rifle was lifted up and
pointed, and three shots came in quick succession at the flying
Croupin. The first went through the lobe of one of his ears, the
second furrowed along the side of his forehead, and the third
passed harmlessly through his clothes just under his left
armpit.</p>

<p>There was no fourth shot fired, for Croupin was upon him with
the leap of a greyhound. There was no chance for either of them
to strike a blow, but Bascoigne lunged furiously with the butt of
the rifle at Croupin's face. The butt, however, struck harmlessly
in the air, and the next second the ex-convict felt an
excruciating pain in his left elbow, and as quickly as he could
start to scream out in his agony his arm was twisted over his
head, and he crashed to the ground.</p>

<p>Then the voice of Croupin rang out like a clarion call, "Help!
help!" he cried. "I've caught someone who's attacked old Mr.
James."</p>

<p>Help was immediately forthcoming from a dozen places, and in
less than two minutes Bascoigne had been handcuffed and under a
strong escort was being marched into the Manor House. Then to the
great joy of everyone, it was found that the kindly old
Australian was not much hurt, and indeed was able to rise to his
feet and even talk.</p>

<p>"But my good friend," he whispered, pressing the Frenchman's
hand, "you saved me from having my face bashed in. Another second
and the hammer would have fallen, but he heard you shouting, and
dropped it just in time. You are a brave man, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"I never saw a braver action," confirmed one of the
plainclothes men. "This gentleman ran right into that devil's
fire, facing an almost certain death."</p>

<p>A hundred questions were asked by the house-party, but they
were put off by evasive explanations that the attacker was only a
poacher, and finally persuaded, all except Croupin and Angela, to
proceed as arranged to the Town Hall.</p>

<p>Then Larose and Mortimer Fairfax, after a short conversation
together, accompanied by one of the plain-clothes men, went in to
interview Bascoigne, finding him, however, in a very different
mood to that which they had expected.</p>

<p>"Now what the devil does this mean?" he expostulated fiercely.
"I find myself a prisoner, presumably in a gentleman's mansion,
and yet two dastardly assaults have been made upon me, and I have
been obliged to fight for my life."</p>

<p>He gave one glance at the plainclothes men, two at Larose, and
then a long, intent stare at Mortimer Fairfax.</p>

<p>The plain-clothes man had been deputed to do all the talking,
and he at once asked sharply, "What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Thomas Sheldon-Brown," replied Bascoigne with dignity. "My
addresses are The Pines, Crowborough, and 25 Charles Street,
Mayfair. I am a justice of the peace for the county of
Sussex."</p>

<p>"Then, Thomas Sheldon-Brown," said the plain-clothes man
sternly, "I arrest you for firing, with intent to murder, at
Monsieur Raphael de Choisey-Hautville, and I warn you that
anything you say now may be used in evidence against you."</p>

<p>"Damnation!" swore Bascoigne, spluttering with rage, "and
where shall I sleep to-night?"</p>

<p>"In Chelmsford," was the curt reply, "and directly the
Ingatestone sergeant comes up, you'll go straight away."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, over some stiff brandies and sodas Larose
and Mortimer Fairfax were discussing everything together.</p>

<p>"And you recognised him?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Instantly," replied Fairfax. "He's altered a lot, of course,
but his eyes are just the same and the shape of his forehead and
his voice."</p>

<p>"And didn't he look hard at you!" said Larose. His eyes
sparkled. "But one thing&mdash;those wounds he gave to poor de
Choisy-Hautville could not have been more opportune, for we need
not now show down our best cards."</p>

<p>The K.C. considered. "But it's the bail I'm thinking of," he
said thoughtfully, "and that's where we may come a dreadful
crash." He roused himself up in his chair. "You see, he'll bring
out some big guns to get bail, and I'll stake my life it will be
no local solicitor who will be appearing for him on Monday." He
shrugged his shoulders. "The Chelmsford magistrates are only
homely little people after all, and they'll be awed by a big bug
from London."</p>

<p>"But if he gets bail," frowned Larose, looking very
uncomfortable, "we may never see him again. With the resources at
his command he could escape anywhere."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" nodded Fairfax, "and so he'll do his very utmost to
get out on bail on Monday." He looked pessimistic. "You've just
heard the defence he's going to put up, and it'll sound quite a
plausible one. An enthusiastic naturalist out cycling to get a
specimen of a long-eared owl&mdash;it is known there are a few
about here&mdash;and suddenly he is set upon by a man who darts
from behind a tree. Then up comes tearing another fellow and
terrified that he is going to be murdered, the poor naturalist
threatens this second man, calling out that if he doesn't stop
he's going to fire. Well, when this fellow takes no notice of his
warning and still comes rushing on, the nerve-shaken naturalist,
scared out of his life, lets fly bullet after bullet, as he says,
to save his life!" The K.C. shrugged his shoulders again. "Now,
what could sound more plausible?"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "A man can't deliberately fire three
times at another man," he said, "and not be committed on a charge
of firing with intent to kill. Whatever his defence he'll be sent
up for trial."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, of course," agreed Fairfax at once. "But what I mean
is, if his solicitor can so impose upon the Bench that the whole
matter is in reality only a trivial one, due in the first
instance to your terrifying his client by jumping out from behind
that tree"&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"then if they're
prepared to put up substantial bail, I'm more than half afraid
the local J.Ps. will grant it."</p>

<p>Larose nodded grimly. "I understand," he said. "So on Monday
we'll just charge him with firing with deliberate intent to
murder Monsieur de Choisy-Hautville, and then when it comes to a
question of granting bail, we'll fight them tooth and nail. The
Yard will be sure to send down a good man."</p>

<p>Fairfax nodded. "Yes, Matthew Wain will probably come. He's
not much to look at but he's very convincing and puts up with no
nonsense from any one."</p>

<p>A thought seemed suddenly to strike Larose and he leant
forward until his lips were close to the K.C.'s ear. "But now
have you by any chance," he whispered, "a particular friend among
the Chelmsford magistrates to whom you could just give the office
and ask him to be sure and take his place upon the Bench on
Monday? Then we could be certain of one who would oppose bail at
all costs."</p>

<p>Mortimer Fairfax made no reply, but smiling knowingly, tapped
the telephone upon his desk and then solemnly winked one eye.</p>

<p>"Good!" grinned Larose, "the scales of Justice must be kept
even, but still the balance may just want a wee drop of oil on
one side every now and then."</p>

<p><br>
THE following Monday morning the old Court House at Chelmsford
was packed full, for long before the doors had been thrown open a
big crowd of people had been waiting to get in.</p>

<p>The previous day rumour had been busy all round the country-side, for it had been whispered that a man had been caught in the
very act of trying to murder some one in the old Manor House at
Ingatestone.</p>

<p>The Court opened punctually and five magistrates took their
seats upon the Bench. One was a retired Colonel, an old gentleman
with a bald head, a very red face and a huge white moustache;
another was a grocer in the town, who supplied everything for the
Colonel's household; a third was a brewer; the fourth was a
refined-looking woman, the president of the local women's
political association, and the fifth was a plumber who had
recently been made a justice of the peace when the Labour
Government was in power. The old Colonel was in the chair and,
looking very important and stern, he frowned round the Court and
tugged fiercely at his big moustache.</p>

<p>The case of Sheldon-Brown was the only one that morning, and
he appeared in the Court looking smart, well-groomed, and a
typical English country gentleman. There was a drawn look about
his face, however, and it was obvious he was not nearly so
unconcerned as he wished to appear. He was represented by Skipton
Bellington, about the best-known and most capable Police Court
advocate in London.</p>

<p>Bellington was a big, stout man, weighing about seventeen
stone. He had the head and face of a bull, and with his big bold
eyes, he had proceeded to weigh up, in one hard stare, the
personalities of all the magistrates as they had come in. He
decided there was not much danger in any of them. Just local
nobodies, all except the chairman, and he looked peppery and
would have to be handled with more care!</p>

<p>As Mortimer Fairfax had predicted Matthew Wain appeared for
the police. He was a wiry little man with sandy hair and looked
like a fighting terrier. He, too, took good stock of the Bench,
and thought, as Bellington had done, that Colonel Jones was the
main person to be considered. Still, he was not quite certain of
the woman there, for she looked too sympathetic and emotional, he
thought, with all her firm chin and good facial angle.</p>

<p>He looked sideways, with a covert smile, at Bellington, and
smacked his lips in anticipation, for he loved a good fight, and
was sure there was going to be one. He knew what he had been sent
down for. He was not to let the accused get out on bail, what
ever happened, and, as much as possible, he was to keep back all
they knew about him.</p>

<p>He opened his case very quietly, and detailed in brisk,
decisive tones what had happened.</p>

<p>The authorities were in receipt of information that had led
them to expect an attack was going to be made upon Mr. Mortimer
Fairfax, the eminent King's Counsel, and mindful of the fact,
that his half-brother, Archdeacon Lendon, had been murdered in
August last, they had taken good steps to protect him, and no
less than six plainclothes men had been on duty round the Manor
House two nights previously.</p>

<p>Well, the accused had been found prowling about under very
suspicious circumstances, and, in an attempt to apprehend him,
had been in the very act of striking at Inspector Larose's head
with a heavy hammer, as the latter was lying half-stunned upon
the ground, when one of the guests of Mr. Fairfax, a Monsieur de
Choisy-Hautville, had run up to interfere. Then the accused, who
was armed also with a rifle, had fired three times at this guest,
almost at point-blank range, with the undoubted intention of
killing him. Happily, however, he had not succeeded in doing so,
but, nevertheless, Monsieur de Choisy-Hautville's escape had been
a very narrow one, for he had been wounded twice and a third
bullet had passed through his clothing, within an inch of his
heart.</p>

<p>It has since been discovered that the accused had been staying
in an adjoining village under an assumed name, and was, moreover,
an addict to a most deadly drug, cocaine. He was undoubtedly a
most dangerous man to be at large.</p>

<p>The charge was a very grave one and he had no doubt their
Worships would forthwith commit the accused for trial.</p>

<p>Then Larose, Croupin, and two of the plain-clothes men gave
their evidence and substantiated all he had said. Bellington
tried hard to fluster and make them contradict themselves but it
was no good, and in the end he sat down looking very heated and
angry.</p>

<p>Then after a long drink of water, he rose up to put the case
for the accused, and the whole tenor of his speech was to make
light of everything that had occurred. He did not intend for one
moment, he said, to attempt to justify the actions of the
accused, but they were not of the serious nature his humorous
friend, Mr. Wain, had tried to make out. The police were barking
up a wrong tree and if Mr. Mortimer Fairfax indeed had an enemy,
who was seeking to injure him, then it certainly was not the
accused.</p>

<p>As Mr. Wain had said the case was very clear, but in quite a
different way to that he had indicated. The accused was a
harmless, inoffensive naturalist who had come to the
neighbourhood to obtain a specimen of a long-eared owl. He was
naturally of a nervous disposition, and this nervousness had
unhappily been aggravated by his smoking too many cigarettes
lately and also, very injudiciously, taking a little cocaine to
allay a certain irritation of the throat from which he suffered.
So being in that condition, what was more natural, when after
suddenly being grabbed hold of by a strange man in a lonely lane
at night, and then seeing another man rushing upon him, he should
have started to defend himself. He lost his head, that was all,
as probably nine men out of ten would have done in similar
circumstances.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the accused was extremely penitent about the
whole matter, and was anxious to pay substantial compensation to
the gentleman he had wounded and also contribute the sum of
&pound;1000 to the funds of the local hospital. Therefore, taking
all things into consideration, he thought their worships would be
fully justified in imposing a big fine and disposing of the whole
matter straightaway.</p>

<p>Matthew Wain gave a screech of laughter. "And Monsieur de
Choisy-Hautville will at the same time," he called out,
"apologise for having got in the way of the accused's bullets."
His voice rose in contempt. "A fine for a deliberate attempt to
murder! It is a joke."</p>

<p>Colonel Jones gave a quick glance to either side at his
colleagues. "We shall commit the accused for trial," he said
curtly.</p>

<p>Bellington appeared to be rather hurt at their decision. "Then
as to the question of bail, your Worships," he began, "we are
prepared&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bail!" gasped Matthew Wain, jumping to his feet as if he had
been bitten by an adder. "We shall not agree to bail under any
circumstances. It is preposterous to suggest such a thing and my
friend knows it."</p>

<p>"Preposterous!" thundered Bellington, his eyes blazing with
fury as he addressed the Bench. "Why, if your Worships do not
grant it, it will bring down ridicule upon all the county
magistracies in the kingdom!" He almost choked. "Not grant bail
to a man of the standing of my client, a county magistrate
himself! It would be unheard of!"</p>

<p>And then for many minutes the two argued on, with the big man
the thunder, and the little man the lightning. Bellington scowled
and shouted to intimidate the Bench and Wain was at his throat,
interrupting every time he spoke.</p>

<p>But old Colonel Jones was not in the least intimidated if any
of his colleagues were. Years ago he had heard the guns of Mons
and at home, now, he kept in order a very assertive wife. He
regarded the two disputants coldly and would have liked to decide
against them both if he could. He had always thought that most
lawyers were rogues, and certainly neither of these two before
them now looked like gentlemen. Then he remembered the
conversation on the 'phone the other night, with his old friend
Fairfax, whom he now saw in Court, and he decided it was time for
the wrangle to stop.</p>

<p>He would give a decision at once, and he was sure his
colleagues would agree with it afterwards! Binks was his grocer,
Mrs. Callow was a friend of his wife's, the plumber had just sent
him an estimate for putting in a new bath, and the brewer was an
easy-going man with whom he often had a round of golf.</p>

<p>He just looked round casually at his colleagues, and then
rising to his feet majestically, raised his hand for silence.</p>

<p>"We refuse bail," he announced sternly. "We are unanimous,"
and then with a courtly smile he stepped back to make way for
Mrs. Callow to precede him off the Bench.</p>

<h2><a id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br>

THE BATTLE OF THE GIANTS.</h2>

<p class="first">THE arrest and committal for trial upon a charge
of attempted murder of the well-known philanthropist, Mr.
Sheldon-Brown, was the sensation of all the newspapers the next
morning.</p>

<p>There were so many intriguing points about the arrest. The
wealth and social position of the accused, the sudden incursion
of London's two most able Police Court advocates into the little
town of Chelmsford to fight the case, the bitter and acrimonious
dispute, as if it were a matter of life or death when the
question of bail came to be considered, the hinting by the police
that even graver charges might follow, and, above all, the fact
that the great international detective, Gilbert Larose, was back
in harness again and had been one of the chief witnesses for the
Crown, all made the case one of outstanding interest. Rumour, of
course, began at once to cry aloud with her thousand tongues.</p>

<p>Scotland Yard was humming like a hive of bees that had been
disturbed, and every plain-clothes man that could be spared was
hunting somewhere! Mortimer Fairfax was the half-brother of that
old clergyman, Archdeacon Lendon, who had been so mysteriously
murdered last August, and the veil upon a dreadful family
vendetta was about to be lifted! Sheldon-Brown's magnificent
residence in Crowborough had been raided by the police, and, most
astounding tale of all, the romantic marriage of the beautiful
Lady Helen Ardane and Gilbert Larose had turned out a dreadful
failure for the latter had left Carmel Abbey for ever and, in
dire financial straits, it was to earn his living only that he
had been forced to return to the yard!</p>

<p>Unhappily for the scandal-mongers this last story came
abruptly to an inglorious end when an enterprising photographer
from the Daily Cry motored down into Norfolk and snapped Mr. and
Mrs. Larose coming out of the village church after the
christening of a child of one of the Abbey tenants. Also, he
obtained the interesting story from one of the villagers that
however busy the great detective might have been of late he had
rarely let 48 hours go by without flashing down at night for a
few hours in his blue single-seater car that was so well known
all round the countryside.</p>

<p>Still this little tit-bit of scandal, snatched from their very
lips, was as a small thing compared with the sensation that
followed so quickly after, for on the Thursday Sheldon-Brown was
removed to London by special order, and the following day, to the
stunned amazement of the public, under the name now of Oscar
Bascoigne, an ex-convict, charged before the Recorder with the
murders of Sir John Lorraine and Archdeacon Lendon.</p>

<p>The proceedings before the Recorder were very brief, for to
the surprise of all present in the Court, after the bare outline
of the charges had been given, it was at once announced that the
accused was reserving his defence. So with no more ado he had
been committed for trial.</p>

<p>The evening papers sold like wildfire, and there were probably
few people that night who did not read one. The public were quick
to realise what it meant and were almost unanimously of opinion
that the Terror gang had at last been laid by the heels. More
arrests, they were sure, would soon follow, and now they could
understand why Larose was in the limelight again, for, of course,
with his genius for the tracking down of crime his assistance had
been invoked by the authorities.</p>

<p>"And it is no disgrace to the Yard," nodded the wise ones,
"for only once in a generation comes a man like Larose. He can
reason backwards as easily as other people reason forward, and it
is no wonder that in Australia there are those who, after a
murder has been committed, actually believe that he can see the
shadow of the murderer upon the wall."</p>

<p>Angela was very tearful that all the details of her father's
murder were being recalled again, and when Croupin called that
night at Surbiton she was almost upon the point of breaking
down.</p>

<p>"Let us go into the music-room, Mademoiselle," he said
nervously, "I, too, am very distressed to-night."</p>

<p>But then when the door was closed behind them, instead of
giving the explanation she expected, he seated himself before the
harpsichord and began to play, and she, upon the settee by the
window, stared out into the darkness, as for a long while she
listened to the soft and beautiful harmonies that he drew from
the old instrument.</p>

<p>Presently, however, with a little grimace and a deep sigh, she
moved across the room, and, drawing up a chair close to him, laid
her hand gently upon his arm. "That'll do, thank you, Monsieur,"
she said quietly. "I want to speak to you."</p>

<p>Croupin's heart beat quickly, for behind her gentle tones he
sensed somehow that something stern and serious was coming.</p>

<p>"Bien," he said equally, quietly. "I am always at your
service, as you know,"&mdash;his voice deepened
passionately&mdash;"now and for ever."</p>

<p>She laughed a little nervously. "You court differently in your
country, Monsieur," she began, "to the way we do in ours." She
was obviously speaking with an effort. "For example, you have
been with me a lot lately, and yet you have only kissed me once
and then"&mdash;her voice was mocking&mdash;"you assure me it was
an accident."</p>

<p>"There are kisses and kisses, Mademoiselle," replied Croupin
gravely, "and the kisses I would give you would have the promise
of a lifetime's devotion behind them." He bowed. "They are not to
be given until you are my affianced wife"&mdash;his voice was
very sorrowful&mdash;"and now I am not justified in asking
you."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed the girl carelessly and yet choking back a
lump in her throat, "but my godmother has told me that you spoke
to her about me at Ingatestone and said"&mdash;she
hesitated&mdash;"that you wanted to take me back to France." She
laughed lightly. "Of course I might have told you that I didn't
want to go, but still it would be interesting to learn the reason
why you have so suddenly changed your mind." She seemed quite
amused now and bent forward confidingly. "You know, Monsieur, a
girl is always flattered when she received a proposal, whether
she is going to accept it or not."</p>

<p>The lines of Croupin's face were soft and gentle.
"Mademoiselle," he said very solemnly, "I would ask you to become
my wife this very moment were it not wrong that for the present I
should ask you to link your name with mine." He reached over and
took her hand. "Come, let me hold it, and I shall have courage to
tell you everything."</p>

<p>The girl flushed. "But it's not going to be such a surprise as
you think," she said quickly, "for I know you are that other
Raphael who was put in prison. Your name was Croupin before you
changed it."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" exclaimed Croupin, very aghast. "Who told you?"</p>

<p>"No one," scoffed the girl, "but I guessed it that night when
General Lesage spoke about him at dinner. I had come to learn the
kind of man you were by then, and the answers you gave were just
what I should have expected of you."</p>

<p>Croupin's face set like a flint, and he let go her hand
instantly. "Then you think I'm a bad man," he said grimly, "that
I'm despicable altogether!"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," she replied warmly. "I was only meaning that
you are brave and resourceful, and can meet any situation with
courage." She spoke carelessly again. "As for any wrongs you have
committed, I am sure you are sorry for them, and if it has been
in your power you have atoned for them." She looked fearlessly at
him. "Do you think I should have gone into the conservatory alone
with you that night if I were despising you?" She spoke gently.
"I was sorry for you."</p>

<p>Croupin's face was the very picture of astonishment, and then
the stern lines faded from his face, and he looked very sad
again.</p>

<p>The girl went on, "I am not quite a fool, Monsieur, and if I
hadn't liked you I wouldn't have given you the encouragement that
you may perhaps be imagining I have done." She tossed her head.
"If he were as rich as Croesus I wouldn't marry a bad man and be
made miserable for life."</p>

<p>Croupin spoke very gently. "It is well that they called you
Angela," he said, "for you are as near being an angel as any
woman can be." He reached for her hand again. "No, I am not a bad
man, and if I had not been put in prison unjustly I should never
have gone the way I did afterwards."</p>

<p>A long silence followed, and then Croupin went on&mdash;"I
have just come from Mr. Fairfax, to whom I have told everything,
and the position is this. The trial of that dreadful man will
come on in a few weeks, and as I shall be one of the witnesses it
is almost certain that they will have been making inquiries about
me, and so when I go into the witness-box, to discredit the value
of my evidence, they will force me to acknowledge that I have
been in prison." He let go her hand. "And that is why I cannot
ask you to be my wife until we see what happens."</p>

<p>He rose quickly to his feet. "And now, Mademoiselle, I must
go, and if you do not see me for some weeks"&mdash;his voice
shook a little&mdash;"you will understand why."</p>

<p>Angela rose up too, and stood regarding him with a curious
expression upon her face.</p>

<p>"You are not very just, Monsieur," she said quietly, "for you
take all the courage to yourself." Her eyes flashed. "Do you
think I have had no courage in being seen about with a man whom I
knew at any moment someone might recognise as having been branded
as a thief."</p>

<p>Croupin flushed. "I don't quite understand what you mean," he
stammered.</p>

<p>"Then you are very dense," she smiled, "and not nearly as
intelligent as I thought you were." She held out her hand and
added sweetly: "Goodbye, Monsieur de Choisy-Hautville. I see you
prefer to fight your battles"&mdash;she hesitated a
moment&mdash;"alone."</p>

<p>Croupin seized her hand almost roughly, and then when she
tried to withdraw it would not let it go. "Tell me what you
mean," he said hoarsely. "I am as a child where you are
concerned. Come, I won't let you go until I know what you
mean."</p>

<p>It was now Angela's turn to flush. "I mean, Monsieur," she
replied very softly, "would it not be better for you to have some
one by your side when your disgrace comes?" She drew herself up
proudly. "I shall not be afraid of what people say."</p>

<p>There was no mistaking now what she meant, but for a long
moment Croupin stood looking down into her eyes. Then very gently
he drew her to him, and tilting up her chin, touched her lips
lightly with his own. The kiss was a very short one, but a moment
later he swung her up into his arms, and this time their lips met
long and passionately.</p>

<p>So, for all ages have man and woman dreamed, and as long as
time lasts will their dream continue to run its little course!
The night will have no ending, the stars will never fade, and
there will be no morning with the waning of desire.</p>

<p>And if Raphael Croupin had at last found a mistress who would
lavish all her love upon him, he had surely also found one who
would see that he walked henceforth in the straight and narrow
way.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Commissioner of Police and Larose were
closeted together, and they both looked troubled, for not half an
hour previously the very startling news had come through that
Sabine Guildford had had a stroke of apoplexy and died within
three minutes.</p>

<p>"The medical officer told me last week," almost wailed the
Commissioner, "that his blood-pressure was dangerously high, and
he might go off in any excitement, but I certainly never expected
this." He looked plaintively at Larose. "It couldn't have
happened at a worse time, for our charging him to-morrow with the
murders of that tea-broker and Clutterbuck would have just let
the public know we are not such duds as they think we are." He
scowled. "I wish to goodness now I had not listened to you, and
had had him charged straightaway, when I wanted to."</p>

<p>Larose seemed in no way offended. "It wouldn't have been safe,
sir," he smiled, "for we should never have caught Bascoigne if
all that we knew about Guildford had been broadcast
prematurely."</p>

<p>The Commissioner smiled back. "Yes, yes, you are quite right,"
he said. He laughed. "I'm greedy, and want all the fish in the
basket." He became serious again. "But this means that
Bascoigne's case will come on sooner than we thought, and it may
even be taken this session."</p>

<p>"Well, we are all prepared except for the finger-print
business," said Larose confidently, "and I somehow think that
matter will not be so difficult to solve as we imagine."</p>

<p><br>
A FEW weeks later, one cold and foggy morning, the stage was
all set for the trial of Oscar Bascoigne, and surely never before
had a greater crowd risen in that court than when Lord Arlingham,
who was to try the case, entered.</p>

<p>Now there is always something very strange about the
atmosphere of a Court of Justice when the matter at issue is one
of life or death. It has a peculiarity all of its own, and to a
thoughtful mind, with all its majesty and refinements, it harks
back to the savagery from which the race has sprung. The culture
and kindliness of our age are stripped ruthlessly of their veils,
and, beholding forces that are almost elemental in their cruelty
and their passion, we realise that from the whipping-post and the
scaffold are still spoken the thousand and one commandments of
our communal laws.</p>

<p>The beast of the jungle has met another beast more powerful,
and that is all.</p>

<p>Yet, nevertheless, everything is so overlaid with such beauty
and wealth of ritual that the brutality and horrors of the combat
are all forgotten in the grandeur of the majesty of the law.</p>

<p>There are so many appeals to the imagination&mdash;in the
hushed and awe-inspiring opening of the Court&mdash;in the
dramatic entrance of the prisoner when all have resumed their
seats&mdash;in the quaint and age-old phrasing of the
indictment&mdash;and in the solemnity of the taking of the
oaths.</p>

<p>Then we see the judge, enthroned as a great high-priest upon
his dais, brave and magnificent in his wig and ermined gown; and
below him the shining lights of the legal world, attired also in
raiment to lift them above the common herd, who are to battle
over the life of a man, and incidentally whose motor cars and
whose town houses and country houses depend upon their prowess in
the fight.</p>

<p>So, to the majority of the spectators, who by privilege or
favour have secured seats in the court, a trial for murder
presents the most intense drama of their lives, and with quickly
beating hearts they stare wide-eyed at the prisoner, thrilling at
the thought that they may be actually gazing upon a man who is
standing in the very shadow of the valley of death. They will
almost choke, too, with a terrifying yet sweet emotion if in the
end the Judge puts on the black cap. The women among them are all
well dressed, and probably many of them are dainty and pretty
looking. They have brought vanity bags, and will powder their
faces before the very eyes of the man who is about to be
condemned. Some of them are delicately scented, too, and maybe
the prisoner's last memory of womankind will be associated with
the perfume from some chemist's shop.</p>

<p>And it was before an assembly such as this that Oscar
Bascoigne mounted into the dock that morning to stand his trial
upon the charges of having murdered Sir John Lorraine and
Archdeacon Lendon.</p>

<p>He looked much better than he had done at Chelmsford, a little
thinner, perhaps, but due probably to his enforced abstinence
from any drug, much less strained and heavy about the eyes. He
was dressed smartly, and, as before, looked the very type of an
English country gentleman. He seemed in no way abashed at his
position, and glanced round the court with an air of quiet and
assured confidence.</p>

<p>Peter Drew was leading for the Crown, and a handsome-looking
man in the late thirties, he had a fine Grecian profile, with a
thoughtful and, in repose, rather gentle face. It was only when
one took note of the mouth and chin that one could discern his
latent strength of character.</p>

<p>Tresidder-Jarvis, also a King's Council was leading for the
defence, and one of the most eminent members of his profession,
he was a mighty fighter in the Criminal Courts. He was stout,
with a massive head coming almost straight away from his
shoulders, and he surveyed the world from under big and bushy
eyebrows. He had the large and mobile lips of the orator.</p>

<p>There was a gentle whispering at the table as the charges were
being read, and then, upon a nod from his lordship, Peter Drew
rose instantly to his feet.</p>

<p>"My lord and gentlemen of the jury," he began in quiet and
beautifully modulated tones, "never perhaps in the annals of all
time has a stranger tale been told in any Court of Justice than I
am going to tell you now, and its ramifications are so many that
I have had considerable difficulty in determining which
particular one to explore first. They go back to happenings that
occurred nearly sixteen years ago, and they deal with matters of
only a few weeks back." He spoke very solemnly. "There should,
indeed, be four men, instead of one, arraigned for murder now
before these Courts, but where the long arm of the Law has failed
to reach the hand of God has struck, and the prisoner is the only
one of them alive to-day."</p>

<p>He looked towards the jury. "But, notwithstanding we are
concerned now only with these two specific charges laid against
the prisoner, nevertheless to convince you of his guilt, I shall
have many times to refer to the crimes of these others, because
they and the prisoner undoubtedly constituted that gang of
criminals, who, for months past, as you are well aware, have been
terrorising the country with their deeds of dreadful
violence."</p>

<p>His tone was easy and conversational. "Now once upon a time,
and, indeed, up to a few weeks ago, there were four men who,
among a number of others, used to gather in a shed in the
backyard behind a marine store in Limehouse, kept by a Chinaman,
called Ah Chung," and then he went on to describe the horrible
nature of the entertainments provided, and to relate how these
four men became acquainted with one another there. Then he told
of three of them being ex-convicts living under assumed names,
and who they were and for what offences they had been imprisoned.
Finally, he disclosed the identity of the fourth man, Sir Charles
Carrion, a once very eminent surgeon, but who only a few years
back had been released from an asylum for the insane.</p>

<p>His voice became most impressive. "And in the light of events
that followed we can see that in their warped and dreadful minds
all these four men considered that upon certain and particular
persons their downfalls or disgrace had, in the main, depended.
The prisoner was incensed against Sir Charles Lorraine, the
judge, before whom he was tried, and also against Mr. Mortimer
Fairfax, who had led for the Crown at the trial. Dr. Libbeus
nursed a relentless hatred against a brother practitioner, Dr.
Bellew, because the latter had communicated with the authorities
when the woman upon whom Libbeus had operated had died. Sabine
Guildford had never forgotten that but for a certain Thomas
Wiggins, a tea-broker, and Anthony Clutterbuck, a brother
solicitor, he might have escaped all consequences of his
embezzlement, and, lastly, Sir Charles Carrion was well aware
that it was to Lord Burkington, a surgeon equally as eminent as
himself, to whom he owed all his hospital appointments being
taken away, and his certification for an asylum, as he was
becoming insane."</p>

<p>He paused here to take a drink of water, and then went on: "So
here we have what is undoubtedly the most dangerous of all
combinations from a communal point of view&mdash;men of degraded
minds, drug-takers, and almost madmen in their thoughts, in
possession of ample means"&mdash;he nodded solemnly&mdash;"and
obsessed with grievances and intense hatred of their fellow-men."</p>

<p>He looked up from his brief. "But now, my Lord, and gentlemen
of the jury, the scene changes to another meeting place of these
four men, and we are taken down to a little wayside inn about 40
miles from London"&mdash;he shook his head frowningly&mdash;"and
we may never learn why they gathered there. Perhaps it was they
did not trust one another as yet, perhaps even up to that time
they did not know one another's real names. Anyhow, on Sunday,
the 29th of June last, they all arrived at the Gibbet Inn, and
there partook of lunch in the public room."</p>

<p>Then he went on to relate all that had happened at the inn
that day, how Cynthia Cramm had come to hear scraps of their
conversation, how she had run away from home, and how later she
had told what she had overheard, but how no one had believed her,
then how mysterious murder after murder occurring, she had
suddenly become a person of great interest, but how all to no
purpose the best detectives from Scotland Yard had tried to pick
up a clue from her story.</p>

<p>"Then, by the 12th day of September, my lord and gentlemen of
the jury," he cried, "five of the six imagined enemies of these
four men had died violently and bloody deaths, Mr. Mortimer
Fairfax being the only one to be left alive, and, in his stead,
his half-brother, Archdeacon Lendon, who much resembled him, had
been murdered by two bullets through the head."</p>

<p>A deep hush overhung the Court, and instead of the hundred and
more men and women present there, from the dead silence it might
have been an empty room.</p>

<p>Then Peter Drew, after referring to the attempts to bomb St.
Paul's Cathedral and poison the Kingston reservoir, next
proceeded to relate how a certain Cabinet Minister had happened
to meet the ex-detective, Gilbert Larose, and had persuaded him
to return to the Yard and give what assistance he could, how
Larose had interviewed the little Cramm girl, and all that he had
deduced from his conversation with her, how he had then called
upon Lady Lorraine, and what had happened when he and Mr.
Mortimer Fairfax met.</p>

<p>"Then at last," cried Peter Drew, "the authorities began to
see light, and realised without any doubt that the unfortunate
victim of each of these murders must have been the personal enemy
of one or other of those miscreants who had entered into that
dreadful pact of crime that Sunday at the Gibbett Inn."</p>

<p>Then the story went on how the voice of Sheldon-Brown had been
found to be that of Bascoigne, and what had happened that night
when Larose had effected an entry into the Crowborough house; how
then through Alf. Flick Larose had got in touch with Mason, the
estate agent of Mile End Road, and what part de Choisy-Hautville
had played in obtaining an impression of his finger-prints; then
how the finger-prints had proved to be those of Sabine Guildford,
the ex-solicitor and ex-convict.</p>

<p>"Then two and two were very quickly put together," said Peter
Drew, after he had related the discoveries of Larose at Leigh-on-Sea, "and just as it had been surmised that the murdered Sir John
Lorraine and Mr. Fairfax had been marked down by the prisoner, so
it was concluded that Thomas Wiggins and Samuel Clutterbuck had
been brought into the scheme of murder by Guildford"&mdash;he
looked at the jury, and paused a long moment&mdash;"the confidant
and associate of Mr. Sheldon-Brown."</p>

<p>Then came the story of the burglary and murder at Rostrellor
Court, and how at once freed from their fears of alarming the
other members of the gang by any reference to the previous
outrages that had taken place, the authorities had made a
lightning arrest of Guildford. Then he told of Larose's
suspicions of Sir Charles Carrion, of the fire in the operating
theatre and all that happened after, including the discovery of
the private bomb factory and the bags of arsenic similar to the
one that had been brought to the Kingston Reservoir.</p>

<p>"But still," said Peter Drew, "there was the prisoner, the
leader of the gang, in a position where the authorities could not
be absolutely certain of obtaining a conviction, for they had up
to then no direct evidence against him." He nodded grimly. "So
being confident that he was only waiting for the opportunity to
exact his second vengeance and murder Mr. Fairfax, they set a
trap for him"&mdash;he paused dramatically&mdash;"and he fell
into it."</p>

<p>Then he related the arrangements made between Larose and
Mortimer Fairfax, and all that had happened a few nights later at
Ingatestone, ending with the seizing of the prisoner who had,
however, tried so desperately to evade capture that he had not
hesitated to fire his rifle three times with the deliberate
intention of committing murder.</p>

<p>He looked again towards the jury, and raised his voice to
emphasise the significance of what he had just told them. "Mark
you," he cried, "the police were sure that it would be the
murderer of Sir John Lorraine who would attempt to murder Mr.
Mortimer Fairfax, and setting this trap to catch him"&mdash;he
paused a long moment&mdash;"it was the prisoner, the very man
whom they were expecting to get hold of, who fell into their
hands!"</p>

<p>He paused for a moment to let the information sink in, and
then continued. "Next we see from the visitors' book at the
Majestic Hotel in Harrogate that Mr. Sheldon-Brown and Sir
Charles Carrion arrived there on August 24th"&mdash;his voice was
calm and passionless&mdash;"and upon the 26th Lord Burkington of
The Hall there was murdered."</p>

<p>A long silence ensued here and every eye in the Court was
turned upon the prisoner, but the latter appeared to be quite
unaware of their scrutiny, and was regarding Peter Drew very
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Next," went on the K.C., "we come to the murder of Dr. Bellew
of Great Leighs in Essex, and here we learn Sir Charles and Dr.
Libbeus put up at the Red Lion Hotel in Chelmsford, seven miles
from Great Leighs, on September 3rd and left again the following
day." He spoke in a calm and business-like tone. "Quick work
that, for Dr. Bellew was murdered upon the morning of September
4th. However, there was probably no difficulty experienced there,
for the old gentleman was caught alone at the far end of his long
garden, when he was killed."</p>

<p>He looked up at the jury. "I have only just referred to this
murder of Dr. Bellew, because it was so typical of the methods of
the gang&mdash;putting up at a hotel in the neighbourhood,
accomplishing their fell purpose, and then clearing off as soon
as possible."</p>

<p>He took a drink of water again. "And now we come to the last
two murders and we learn that on September 10th the prisoner and
a Mr. Edward Mason, whom you will remember was the ex-convict
Guildford, put up at the River Hotel at Leigh-on-Sea, and they
occupied two bedrooms and a private sitting-room," he paused
here&mdash;"that all looked straight down upon the house and
garden of Mr. Thomas Wiggins."</p>

<p>He spoke almost as if the recital of the stories of so many
crimes were becoming monotonous. "Well, two days later upon the
13th, Anthony Clutterbuck, the solicitor, was murdered upon
Canvey Island, a few miles away, and upon the evening of the
following day"&mdash;he struck his hand upon the table before
him&mdash;"the very first time that Thomas Wiggins had set foot
out of his garden for more than a week, he was stabbed to death
in a shelter upon the Esplanade."</p>

<p>He took a few moments' rest and then returned to quiet and
even tones. "And now, my lord and gentlemen of the jury, we are
brought up against a fact that will bring home to you most
clearly why, apart from the other reasons I have enumerated, the
authorities, with all their evidence against the prisoner, were
so loath to lay hands upon him at first." He spoke very slowly.
"It was this. When Inspector Larose was hot upon the heels of the
prisoner, and had been quite certain that this Mr. Sheldon-Brown,
of Crowborough and Mayfair, was the ex-convict Oscar Bascoigne,
and he had managed to obtain, in the way I have told you, his
finger-marks, upon their being photographed"&mdash;he paused
dramatically&mdash;"it was found that they were not those of the
company-promoter who had been sentenced to penal servitude
fifteen and a half years ago."</p>

<p>A thrill of intense excitement ran round the Court, and it was
seen that the prisoner was smiling ironically.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Peter Drew confidingly, "the facial photograph
of Oscar Bascoigne that was taken at the time of his conviction,
allowing for the lapse of years, was undoubtedly that of Sheldon-Brown, but the finger-prints and the body measurements recorded
did not in any one respect agree with those of the prisoner." He
shook his head. "The files were checked most carefully, but the
fact remained that unless a ghastly mistake had been
made"&mdash;he shook his head again&mdash;"and they don't make
mistakes like that in the finger print department of Scotland
Yard, Sheldon-Brown, and Oscar Bascoigne were not one and the
same man."</p>

<p>He continued. "As you can imagine, the authorities were
dumbfounded, but then realising that the hundred and one similar
tastes, habits, and peculiarities, and also the recurring attacks
of malaria that I have mentioned to you are common to Sheldon-Brown and the prisoner, could not by any possibility be mere
coincidences, they set to work to find out what had happened, on
the assumption"&mdash;he spoke very sternly&mdash;"that the
records had been tampered with, and tampered with because some
one had been paid well to do it."</p>

<p>"So knowing that the prisoner was a very wealthy man and in
the position of being able to offer a bribe of so substantial a
nature that it would have been a great temptation to any
employee, and knowing also that he had arrived in this country
from South America about four years ago, they started to make
secret inquiries about all who had been working in the finger
print department during that time." He nodded towards the jury.
"They were curious if any among them had been living as if he had
come into money."</p>

<p>He took a sip of water and went on briskly. "And they were
soon rewarded for their pains, for almost at once it was
remembered of one of the officials who had occupied a very
responsible position in the department, that about three years
ago he had been dismissed under very peculiar circumstances."</p>

<p>He gave a quick glance up at the prisoner, who in the
imagination of many in the Court had gone a little pale and lost
something of his quiet assurance. "This man," he went on, "had
been in the department for 17 years, and had always shown himself
a trustworthy and capable servant. Then all suddenly he started
to neglect his duties and absent himself without adequate
explanation. Also, he took to coming to work under the influence
of liquor, and finally he struck a superior officer and was then,
of course, summarily dismissed." He looked significantly at the
jury. "In effect, he deliberately made them send him away."</p>

<p>Peter Drew raised one long forefinger impressively. "This man
was traced with difficulty, for he had been killed in a motor
accident last May, but what was found out was this. About three
weeks after he had been thrown out of employment, to the great
astonishment of his relations and every one who knew him, he had
left his house in Balham, and, paying cash down, had bought a
poultry farm near Saffron Walden. Then from the moment of his
taking over, this concern appeared to have developed into an
extraordinary success, for its purchaser at once started to live
well and was able to send his two boys, he was a widower, to a
good school in the neighbourhood." He thumped again upon the
table. "But my lord and gentlemen of the jury, I shall bring
before you the manager of the National and Provincial Bank in
Saffron Walden and he will tell you that this man, within a few
days of his coming to live in the neighbourhood, deposited with
him Government bonds to bearer of no less value than the sum of
&pound;9000."</p>

<p>He folded up his brief and sat down. He had spoken for longer
than five hours, and it being nearly 5 o'clock the Court rose
until the following day.</p>


<hr>


<h2><a id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI.<br>

THE BATTLE CONTINUED.</h2>

<p class="first">THE following day, all day long, a procession of
witnesses trooped in and out of the witness-box; the head of the
finger-print department of Scotland Yard, the manager from the
bank at Saffron Walden, the one-time valet of Oscar Bascoigne,
and half a dozen city men who had been acquainted with the
company promoter in former days.</p>

<p>Tresidder-Jarvis seemed to be little interested in any of
them, for of some he asked nothing at all, and to the others he
put, perhaps, only a single question.</p>

<p>Cynthia Cramm appeared presently and she entered the witness-box with an aplomb that made every one smile. She told all that
had happened that Sunday at the Gibbett Inn, and during her
subsequent association with Larose, and how finally she had
picked out the prisoner's voice at once, when standing out of
sight of every one in the corridor she had heard the head warder
carry on a number of conversations with other prisoners through
the opened doors of the rooms in which they were confined.</p>

<p>Tresidder-Jarvis cross-examined her at some length, but could
not shake her evidence in any way. Then he asked finally with an
awe-inspiring frown: "And do you actually want this Court to
believe that after listening to that man's voice in your father's
inn for a few minutes last June&mdash;you were actually able to
recognise it again, when you stood in that corridor the other day
after five months had passed away?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Cynthia convincingly, "I recognised it at
once."</p>

<p>"Then you must be a very remarkable young woman," said
Tresidder-Jarvis dryly, and then as he prepared to resume his
seat, he added sarcastically, "I suppose it must be a gift you
have inherited from your father who has listened to so many
voices in his bar, calling for beer."</p>

<p>"No," commented Cynthia pertly, as she was bustling out of the
witness box, "I get it from my mother who was a telephonist for
ten years before she married."</p>

<p>Larose was the next witness, and a thrill of expectation ran
round the Court when his name was called. Here was the star
witness for the Crown, and the man who had sent so many people to
the scaffold that he was known as the Angel of Death. Besides,
who had forgotten his romantic marriage to the rich and beautiful
Lady Ardane, such a little while ago?</p>

<p>Larose looked very spick and span, with his handsome face
tanned to a rich bronze by his many journeyings in an open
touring car. He made an ideal witness and under the skilful
questioning of Peter Drew the whole tale was soon told of all
that had happened, from his first meeting with Cynthia Cramm to
when he had been knocked down by the prisoner at Ingatestone.</p>

<p>Tresidder-Jarvis smiled pleasantly when he rose up to cross-examine. "Now I take it, Mr. Larose," he said quietly, "that it
is for no matter of remuneration that you have been working on
the case for the authorities! You have just taken it on, so to
speak, for the love of the thing?" and when Larose answered,
"Yes," he added: "It is a sort of sport to you?"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "No, not exactly," he replied, "but it
has been my life's work, and it still appeals to me."</p>

<p>Tresidder-Jarvis nodded as if he quite understood. "But of
course you are anxious to show the Yard, and incidentally the
public, too, that you are still the same old Gilbert
Larose,"&mdash;he smiled ironically&mdash;"the man who never
fails!" He paused a moment and the smile left his face. "Then
that being so, according to your lights, you have done everything
in your power to produce evidence against the prisoner!"</p>

<p>"I have done everything in my power," corrected Larose, "to
find out everything he has been doing."</p>

<p>"And you have not been too scrupulous in your methods either,
have you," suggested the K.C. with the fire of battle now
beginning to smoulder in his eyes. "In fact, not to mince words,
you have resorted to criminal means yourself."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" exclaimed Larose, very surprised.</p>

<p>"Yes, oh! oh!" repeated Tresidder-Jarvis sarcastically, and
then his jaw shot out and his voice rose ominously. "You broke
into the prisoner's house, sir, like a common felon yourself,
with no mandate from the authorities, and you abstracted
therefrom property belonging to the prisoner." His eyes glared.
"You took a paper from his desk! Now, do you attempt to justify
that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Larose boldly. "The need was urgent and the
occasion was so opportune that in the public interest I acted
without authority. Murders were being committed, bombs were
being&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That'll do, thank you," interrupted Tresidder-Jarvis rudely.
"You are not in the witness-box to make speeches, but to answer
questions," and Larose, with a smile, at once subsided into
silence.</p>

<p>The K.C. went on very sternly. "And your assistant, your
accomplice that night was a"&mdash;he looked down at his notes
and spoke with intense sarcasm&mdash;"A Monsieur Raphael de
Choisy-Hautville. Was he, a foreigner, acting under the
instructions of the authorities here in investigating this case?"
he asked incredulously.</p>

<p>"No," replied Larose instantly, "but he is friend of mine, and
meeting him accidentally upon the day when I was invited to come
back to the Yard, I suggested that as he had nothing particular
to do at that moment he should help me."</p>

<p>"What is his occupation?" was the next question asked very
quietly.</p>

<p>"He does nothing. He is a well-to-do man of independent
means."</p>

<p>"But now, did you consider it wise," asked Tresidder-Jarvis
with a frown, "to take him into your confidence, when you were
working for the Crown?" and when Larose had replied "Yes," he
broke suddenly into a voice that rose stridently through the
Court. "But are you aware, Mr. Gilbert Larose," he thundered,
"that this man, this friend of yours, is an ex-convict, who for
years has been the target of the French authorities, the Surete
Generale of Paris?"</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Larose, "quite aware."</p>

<p>Tresidder-Jarvis half-closed his eyes and proceeding to ask
the next question, his loud tone subsided all at once like the
dying away of a storm. "Then for what purpose did you take him
with you, to Crowborough?" he asked, almost gently.</p>

<p>"To see if he could open the safe," replied Larose candidly.
"He has considerable knowledge of safes generally."</p>

<p>"Ah!" came a long-drawn exclamation of the great K.C., as he
turned round to glance at the jury. "Considerable knowledge of
safes!" He looked back at Larose. "I expect so."</p>

<p>He picked up his brief and after considering it for a few
moments passed quickly on. "And so, after your interview with
that very remarkable young lady, Miss Cramm," he said, with his
lips curving scornfully, "upon the strength of a soiled pair of
boots, a voice, and the reference to a razor, an unpleasant
smell, and a Chinaman from Hankow, you have been able to adduce
all this guilt against the prisoner!"</p>

<p>Then for nearly two hours he kept Larose in the witness-box,
but it was generally conceded he did not get much change out of
him, and had not indeed shaken his evidence upon any point.</p>

<p>The next, and as it turned out, the last witness for the day,
was Raphael Croupin, and another deep thrill ran round the Court
when, upon his name being called, he entered and took his stand
in the witness box.</p>

<p>"Oh! what a good-looking man!" murmured one woman, and another
exclaimed: "Poor fellow! he probably doesn't know what is in
store for him."</p>

<p>Croupin's dark eyes flashed curiously up at the gallery, and
his handsome face lighted up as they fastened upon Angela, who
was sitting there with her hands clenched so tightly that the
nails almost bit into the flesh.</p>

<p>Peter Drew took him in hand, and quickly drew out the salient
parts of his association with Larose, and the part he had taken
in getting in touch with Guildford.</p>

<p>Tresidder-Jarvis rose to cross-examination with all the
delight in his massive face of a terrier about to worry a
rat.</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Choisy-Hautville," he began, rolling out the
words as if he took great pleasure in their enunciation, "we have
heard that Mr. Larose took you with him when that night he broke
into the prisoner's residence in Crowborough." His voice was
silky and quite innocent of offence. "Well, tell the Court why he
took you down with him."</p>

<p>"To see if I could manage to open the safe," replied Croupin
at once.</p>

<p>Tresidder-Jarvis's voice was still pleasant. "And what
experience, pray, had you in opening safes?" he asked gently.</p>

<p>"I am the patentee of a certain lock," replied Croupin
confidingly, "and one of the largest shareholders in a safe
manufacturing company, Le Tourjours Sauf, of Rue de la Lune,
Paris."</p>

<p>"Oh!" grunted the K.C. and his face hardened, as if he were
very much annoyed, "then what was your occupation before you came
into this estate that we are given to understand you now
possess?"</p>

<p>Croupin's reply was quite ready. "I was a dealer in
paintings," he said, "an expert in precious stones, and"&mdash;he
smiled, "I taught music."</p>

<p>"Is de Choisy-Hautville your real name?" asked the K.C.
carelessly.</p>

<p>"It is now," replied Croupin, looking interestedly round the
Court. "It was my mother's maiden name and I adopted it six
months ago, when I came into the money." He looked quite
innocently at the K.C. "Before that I was Raphael Croupin."</p>

<p>"And did you change your name, Monsieur," asked Tresidder-Jarvis silkily, "because of this estate you inherited?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Croupin, "that had nothing to do with it."</p>

<p>"Then for what reason did you change it?" asked the K.C.</p>

<p>Croupin's face was pathetic. "Because I have been in prison,"
he replied sadly, "and I thought if I changed my name people
would forget me sooner."</p>

<p>A deep hush filled the Court, and for the moment Tresidder-Jarvis was in such a fury of annoyance that he could not pick up
his train of thought. He could see now that a trap had been set
for him and he had fallen into it like the veriest tyro at the
bar.</p>

<p>His next remark was almost brutal in its rudeness. "You need
not pull faces like that," he said loudly, "for it doesn't
impress the Court," and then before Peter Drew could interfere to
protect his witness he blurted out roughly: "And if you have been
in prison only once, you have been tried many times, have you
not?"</p>

<p>"Three," replied Croupin promptly, "and I was acquitted every
time."</p>

<p>Then for half an hour he tried to catch Croupin tripping, but
the latter never made a mistake, and in the end Tresidder-Jarvis
sat down looking hot and out of temper.</p>

<p>Peter Drew at once rose up to re-examine. "Arising out of the
questions my learned friend has just asked you," he said, "tell
the Court when it was you were in prison and what for."</p>

<p>"It was ten years, ago," replied Croupin, "when I was
eighteen, and I was found guilty of stealing the jewels of my
hostess in a country house. I was sentenced to two years'
imprisonment."</p>

<p>"Did you serve the whole term?" asked Peter Drew.</p>

<p>"No, I was released after one year and one month," replied
Croupin, "because the man who had been the chief witness against
me was himself caught breaking into another house. He was shot
dead."</p>

<p>"And these are the papers substantiating your statements?"
asked Peter Drew, handing up a small parcel of faded newspapers
for him to examine.</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Croupin, and the papers were at once passed up
to the Bench.</p>

<p>"And one more question," said Peter Drew. "Why is it, in your
opinion, these three other charges have been brought against
you?"</p>

<p>"Because," replied Croupin, "it has become a sort of legend in
my country that when any art treasures are stolen it must be I
who have done it. It has been so ever since I succeeded in
getting in the Louvre one night, and affixed a notice to a
painting that it was not a genuine Rubens, but only a copy." He
smiled. "I was apprehended in the morning, when trying to get
away."</p>

<p>That ended the day's proceedings, and Croupin's reward for the
ordeal he had gone through came that night when Angela put her
arms about his neck and told him she was proud of him, and that
he need never be ashamed any more. Croupin sighed heavily.</p>

<p>Then during the ensuing two days witness after witness stepped
into the witness-box and corroborated every statement Peter Drew
had made in his address.</p>

<p>Again Tresidder-Jarvis showed little interest and either let
them go altogether, or else just asked a few what seemed to be
quite unimportant questions.</p>

<p>Then on the fifth day he rose to open the case for the
defence, and directly he began to speak the spectators were of
opinion they were going to enjoy themselves.</p>

<p>"My lord and gentlemen of the jury," he began, "in the opening
words of his address for the Crown my learned friend announced
that the story he was going to unfold to you would be
extraordinary, but surely it is much more extraordinary still
that he ever stood up to tell it, for notwithstanding the
eloquence of his address and the large number of witnesses who
have been brought before you, we have seen he is not in
possession of one single atom of convincing proof against the
prisoner."</p>

<p>He smiled sarcastically. "Of course it is most unfortunate for
him that all the witnesses whose testimony would have been vital
to the charge have passed away. The Governor of Dartmoor Prison
is dead, two of the most important officials in charge there are
dead also, Sir Charles Carrion is dead, Sabine Guildford is dead,
Dr. Libbeus is dead, the mythical receiver of the enormous bribe
is dead, and even the Chinaman, Ah Chung, who might perhaps have
been able to tell us something, is sleeping with his
ancestors."</p>

<p>He looked up at the jury. "Now I will at once take the
question of identity, for it is undeniable that if the prisoner
cannot be shown to be the ex-convict Bascoigne, then there is no
conceivable motive for the crimes and the while elaborate edifice
of guilt that my learned friend has built up topples
ignominiously to the ground."</p>

<p>He punctuated his words with his hand. "Now to every
individual who has been brought here to testify that after the
long lapse of years he can recognise the prisoner as Oscar
Bascoigne, it has been first suggested the fact that it is so. In
effect, to each of them it has been said. 'Here is Oscar
Bascoigne whom you once knew and we want you now to recognise him
for us!'" He emphasised his point. "You see the idea has been put
in their minds, and, admitted that there are certain physical
points of resemblance between the two, what is more natural than
that they have fallen into the trap?"</p>

<p>He proceeded to elaborate his contention for a few minutes,
and then nodded confidentially to the jury. "So you see we are
fully justified in regarding with a very grave suspicion these
wholesale recognitions with which we have been regaled."</p>

<p>He laughed scornfully. "And how has he tried to induce you to
believe that it is so." He lowered his voice and went on,
speaking very slowly and in mock solemnity now. "An employee in
the finger-print department was dismissed three years ago, and it
has just been discovered that later he was in the possession of a
poultry farm and &pound;9000!" He paused for a moment and looked
smilingly towards the jury box. "Yes, he had not had money left
him and kept it quiet&mdash;the head of his department told you
he was a silent and reserved man&mdash;he had not perhaps had
&pound;5 upon two horses in a double at long odds, nor yet again
he was not sharing in some good prize in the Irish Sweepstakes."
He looked very amused. "No, none of these things happened to him
as might have happened to you or me, but he had been
bribed"&mdash;his big frame shook with merriment&mdash;"just
bribed."</p>

<p>He became serious again. "But I will not labour the point, for
it is as certain as anything is certain in the world that the
prisoner is not Oscar Bascoigne, and that, therefore, if he is
guilty of these crimes with which he is charged&mdash;they were
motiveless and committed without reason."</p>

<p>He picked up his notes. "And now we come to the Gibbett Inn
and the story of Cynthia Cramm and of all she overheard and her
subsequent recognition of the voice of the prisoner as being one
of the four men." He spoke very sternly. "I don't believe a word
of it." He looked up at the jury. "You were able to form your
opinion of her character from her demeanour in the witness-box! A
pert, precocious child delighting to be in the limelight and
filled with her own importance! No doubt she made up the story of
the intended killings she pretended she had overheard, partly to
discount the cool reception she would be receiving from her
parents upon her return home. Then, when she read that murders
had actually taken place you can imagine her saying: 'Yes, and
those were the very names I heard mentioned, Burkington and
Clutterbuck. I told you so,' and her father and the village
policeman having themselves no remembrance of the exact names,
immediately accepted as Gospel what the girl said"&mdash;he
shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"and so the story grew and
grew."</p>

<p>Then he went on to say that when suspicions, conjectures, and
surmises were put away, he was in complete accord with his
learned friend. The prisoner certainly did frequent that shed at
Ah Chung's, along with many others, but being a spectator of
cockfights did not make a man a murderer, such exhibitions were
not approved of in these, perhaps, too squeamish times, but then
it must be remembered that when the greatness of this great
country of ours was being built up in the face of the enmity of
the whole world&mdash;they were the most favoured pastimes of the
people and patronised even by the highest in the land.</p>

<p>Then, too, those visits to Eastbourne, Harrogate, and Leigh-on-Sea were frankly admitted. The prisoner often went to
Eastbourne, and Harrogate was Sir Charles Carrion's favourite
resort, and it was just a coincidence that murders were done when
they were visiting those places together. It was a coincidence
also that the prisoner was at Leigh-on-Sea when those other men
were killed.</p>

<p>He broke off here and nodded towards Peter Drew. "My friend
may laugh," he said dryly, "but such coincidences as these are
occurring every day." He turned towards the jury-box again. "Why,
I am told one of the ushers in this very court, whose name is
Gale, drew the horse Hurricane in the last Derby sweep and sold
half of his ticket to a man called Breeze!"</p>

<p>He reiterated that the case for the Crown was all built up
upon conjectures and they had no proof for instance that Carrion
bore any animosity against Lord Burkington, or, indeed, had even
been aware that his lordship had had any part in getting him put
in an asylum. They had no proof either that Guildford had nursed
any gnawing hatred against two of the many who had given evidence
against him when he had been put on trial.</p>

<p>Unhappily, it was quite useless to put the prisoner into the
witness box, for the levelling of this charge against him had
made him a nervous wreck, and for the time being his memory could
not be relied upon, and he could remember very little of his
early days.</p>

<p>As far, however, as could be gathered, his life-history was
that he had been born in Lagos 45 years ago, with his father the
manager of the mine there, but the family, moving to San
Francisco, he was the only one to survive the great earthquake of
1906, and he had no relations living in any other part of the
world. Then for 12 years he had followed the sea, but later he
had been one of a party prospecting for copper in the interior of
the Argentine, and finally 19 years ago he had made his way to
Santiago and there, after accumulating a large fortune, he had
remained, until he had sailed for England a little over four
years ago.</p>

<p>The great King's Counsel folded up his brief and added
finally: "The prisoner is not Bascoigne, and that being so, the
whole case for the Crown breaks down. I shall call no witnesses
for there is nothing to disprove."</p>

<p>Peter Drew's address in reply was brief but most incisive. He
laughed to scorn the idea of Tresidder-Jarvis's coincidences and
insisted that if any improbabilities had been put forward to
sustain the charge of the Crown, surely they were as nothing to
the improbabilities that formed the whole basis of the defence.
The prisoner had admittedly been a close associate of bombers,
poisoners and murderers, and from the evidence that had been
given it was impossible he had not known of their activities and
taken part in them himself. Indeed, he was probably the worst of
them all. Bascoigne or Sheldon-Brown, his hands were stained in
blood, and he implored the jury not to let loose this monster in
human form upon the community again.</p>

<p>Tresidder-Jarvis, having called no witnesses, had the last
word to the jury, and reiterating over and over again that the
prisoner must be acquitted because as Sheldon-Brown there was no
motive for him to have committed any murder, and the evidence
that he had done so that had been given for the Crown was the
weakest that had ever been put forward in a court of law.</p>

<p>The judge summed up long and carefully, leaning to neither one
side nor the other, but finally admonishing the jury that if
there was the very slightest doubt in their minds they must
acquit the prisoner.</p>

<p>The jury retired at half past three, but having come to no
agreement by six o'clock they were locked up for the night. Then
at noon the following day, and later again at four o'clock, the
foreman intimated to his lordship that there was no possibility
of their agreeing, and so finally they were discharged, and the
prisoner recommitted for trial at the next session.</p>


<hr>


<h2><a id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br>

THE HANGMAN'S KNOT.</h2>

<p class="first">THE day following upon the trial the Chief
Commissioner of Police was furious, for it had become known that
but for the dissension of two of the jurymen the verdict would
have been guilty upon both charges, without any hesitation. One
of the dissentients, too, was a crank who ought never to have
been empanelled, for he objected to capital punishment upon
principle, and the other had taken the stand that although things
certainly looked very suspicious, yet he would never hang a dog
upon circumstantial evidence alone.</p>

<p>Larose, however, was still bright and smiling. "Never mind,
sir," he said trying to hearten the Commissioner, "we'll be more
careful in challenging the jury next time, and may get him after
all."</p>

<p>"But I am always frightened of these disagreements," frowned
the Commissioner, "for they tend to make the next jury nervous,
and you'll always find that one disagreement is likely to be
followed by another." He shrugged his shoulders, "Then the Crown
drops the case and proceeds no further."</p>

<p>Then in the weeks that followed, for the second trial was
listed to begin early in February, both sides were busy. The
Crown sent over to Lagos and Santiago to determine what truth
there was in the statements that had just been forwarded by the
defence and Messrs. Grundy and Grundy, of Lincoln's Inn Fields,
acting for the prisoner, were likewise at work in the same
directions.</p>

<p>Bascoigne had many interviews with his legal advisers, and
upon one occasion he had a long conversation also, in the
presence of a warder, with a well-dressed man who purported to be
an old friend of his. What they said the warder did not know, for
they spoke in a foreign language, but as he caught the word
'Espagnol' several times he judged they must be speaking in
Spanish.</p>

<p>At length the second trial came on, and it followed very much
the same course as the first, except that the Crown now brought
up all they had been able to find out about Bascoigne's alleged
place of birth and the date of his arrival in Santiago. But the
information gathered was most unsatisfactory upon both points,
for while it had certainly been ascertained that a man called
Richard Brown had at one time been the manager of a tin mine near
Lagos, as could be substantiated by that name appearing upon an
old mining prospectus, still the few who remembered him were
certain he had had no wife or children, and neither was there any
evidence of any birth having been registered there. As to the
exact year when a Thomas Sheldon-Brown first appeared upon the
scene at Santiago no one could say with any certainty.</p>

<p>And it was the same with the defence, for they admitted they
had no witnesses to testify upon the prisoner's behalf. The
population of Santiago, they averred, was so floating that
although many remembered Sheldon-Brown as a big and daring
speculator, they were none of them prepared to swear when he came
there.</p>

<p>The trial dragged on for eight days and then as the
Commissioner had anticipated, the jury disagreed again.</p>

<p>"And that's the end of it," he sighed the same evening to
Larose. "They won't try him a third time, but will just drop the
case." He nodded solemnly. "And then you look out, my friend, for
you'll be a marked man. I could only get into the trial once, for
a couple of hours, but I don't forget the way the wretch kept
looking in your direction." He held up his finger warningly.
"He'll get you if he can, you and your wife and that little
daughter of yours."</p>

<p>"Oh! We shall be all right, sir," replied Larose with an
assurance, however, that he did not feel. "I've taken all
precautions in case he did get off, and we are all prepared."</p>

<p>And very soon Larose had good reason to rejoice that he had
anticipated what might happen, for two days later the Crown
entered a nolle prosequi, and, the Ingatestone charge being
dropped also, Bascoigne was once more a free man.</p>

<p>The Commissioner immediately rang up Carmel Abbey to give the
news to Larose, also adding pathetically, "And I have just made
certain of the rumour that it was only one of the jury who
disagreed this time, an uneducated fellow, who works in the meat
market. But for him a unanimous verdict of guilty would have been
returned. It is most mortifying to us all."</p>

<p>And it was certainly particularly mortifying to Larose, for he
could not help being aware that the authorities, and indeed the
public generally, had all along realised that it was upon the
evidence obtained by him that the charges against the prisoner
would be sustained or would fall.</p>

<p>"L'Affaire Larose," as one of the newspapers had humorously
referred to the trial, and upon the Crown entering their nolle
prosequi he saw that same afternoon that the Daily Cry had headed
one of its columns, "The Great International Detective Fails at
Last."</p>

<p>The next day he received an anonymous letter, post-marked
London and made up of words and letters clipped laboriously from
some newspaper and gummed on to a sheet of good-class notepaper.
"Look out, you devil," it read, "for it'll be your turn next." He
did not doubt from whom it came for the envelope and paper were
of a blue colour and an Egyptian cigarette was enclosed, of the
same brand as those which he had seen in the drawer of
Bascoigne's desk.</p>

<p>Then a sinister rumour began to circulate in the city, for it
was whispered the last jury had been 'got at' and one of them
bribed. At any rate it was stated that the one man among them who
had disagreed had done so most unreasonably, just contenting
himself with insisting over and over again that his vote was for
not guilty, and yet refusing to give any reason for his opinion
or enter into any argument at all.</p>

<p>His identity becoming known to an enterprising pressman, the
latter had tried to interview him at his house, but had been
received with angry renunciation and threatened with immediate
violence if he did not clear out. The man still continued to work
at the meat market, but refused to discuss the trial with any
one.</p>

<p>Then ensued a very anxious time for Larose, for he made no
attempt to deceive himself about the danger they were all in at
the Abbey. Bascoigne was a madman, and, as such, might even be
willing to sacrifice his own life to obtain revenge.</p>

<p>So the servants were in part taken into their confidence and
with the explanation given them that for some fancied wrong an
attempt to injure their master or mistress or their little
daughter might be made by a lunatic at any time, warned that a
most careful watch must be set.</p>

<p>The gates leading into the Abbey were from then always kept
closed unless the lodge-keeper was opening them; barbed wire was
fixed all along the walls surrounding the grounds, and during the
day a man, with a rifle handy, was stationed on duty among the
trees. At night three big wolf-hounds roamed at their will, well-muzzled, however, so that they should not pick up any poison-baits thrown over for them.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Mr. Sheldon-Brown had returned to his
Crowborough residence upon the afternoon of his release, like a
savage and sullen dog slinking stiff and sore into his kennel
after a good beating.</p>

<p>Although no charge had been proved against him he nevertheless
knew that in the eyes of the world he was a leper, and, imagining
that every one whom he encountered was aware who he was, he had
left London at the earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>His old servants had gone, leaving without the wages due to
them and telling every one they would not stop another night in
the house with him for a thousand pounds, and so he found the
place empty when he arrived. He had opened the front door with
the key in his left-hand and an automatic pistol in his right.
Then room by room he had gone through the house in the same
stealthy manner until he was assured that there was no one there
and above all&mdash;not Larose.</p>

<p>That night he drugged himself to sleep with brandy and
opiates, and the next day started upon the task of arranging his
domestic affairs, according to what he realised must henceforth
be his mode of life.</p>

<p>He intended to cut himself off from all communication with the
town, and as far as was practical obtain all his supplies from
the city. He would pay no visits and receive none and, above all,
he would fortify his house, for if Larose was afraid of Bascoigne
so equally was Mr. Sheldon-Brown now afraid of Larose.</p>

<p>In the interval between the two trials, in the course of many
conversations with the warders, he had heard a good deal about
Larose and, among other things, had learnt that it was reputed
the one-time detective would never leave a man whom he had once
come to believe was guilty. The warders, with many sly smiles,
had hinted also that it was supposed to be his delight to take
the law into his own hands if he could not get the man he was
after in a lawful way.</p>

<p>Then in about a fortnight Mr. Brown had provided for
everything, and was settling down to a life of severe and
monotonous seclusion.</p>

<p>After considerable trouble, for directly they had learnt who
was wanting them, several eligible parties had immediately cried
off, he had succeeded in obtaining new servants, consisting of a
Scotch family, father, mother, and daughter, whom he had engaged
at a very high rate of wage.</p>

<p>This family knew all about him, and, having read almost every
word that had been written about both trials, the older two, at
any rate, were taking no chances.</p>

<p>The husband, who acted as butler, a dour, poker-faced man from
Inverness, always carried a cheap pistol about with him in his
hip pocket, and his wife, the cook-housekeeper, was never very
far away from a big skewer that she kept handy on the kitchen
dresser. Only the daughter seemed to have no fear, and, a fine,
buxom lass, she often made eyes at her master, in the hope that
he might die one day and leave her something in his will. From
the notice Mr. Brown took of her, however, it almost seemed that
he was unaware of her existence.</p>

<p>The house was now well guarded, for every door and window had
its own alarm, and all the windows on the ground floor had high
steel shutters that were swung to and barred at night. The front
door had now another lock, and no would-be intruder could open it
with a skeleton key.</p>

<p>The garden was left neglected. Weeds, inches high, now grew
upon the paths and the beautiful flowers, of which their master
had once been so proud, bloomed uncared for and in disarray.</p>

<p>Then in the weeks that followed, Mr. Brown was always distant
and short of speech with his servants. He never spoke to them
except to give an order, and then he gave it with a scowl as if
he grudged the words he uttered.</p>

<p>He rarely went out into the garden, but every morning would
proceed into his garage and make sure his car was ready for
instant service, testing the pressure of the tyres and letting
the engine run for a few minutes.</p>

<p>The rest of the day, except for coming out for scanty and
hurried meals, he would spend in his study, with the door locked
so that he should not be disturbed. There, leaning back in a big
arm-chair for hours and hours he would brood, staring into
vacancy, or again, he would seat himself at his desk and write
feverishly, but in a beautiful copper-plate handwriting, in a
thick morocco-bound book that he always carried about with him,
and never for one moment let out of his sight.</p>

<p>Larose was always the obsession of his mind, and fearful that
the one-time detective might be on the watch for him, he never by
any chance took a step outside the house after dark. He nearly
always, however, kept very late hours; and then above the
curtains of his study windows, until long after the chimes of
midnight had struck, a thin streak of light would filter through
outside.</p>

<p>Always expecting that some one would attempt to break in, the
slightest sound would make him start and lift his head, but then
after a few moments he would remember the steel shutters and
closely barred doors, and with a loaded automatic upon the desk
before him, his mind would sink to rest again and he would feel
assured that no danger would come near him.</p>

<p>Night and day he nursed a dreadful hatred as he thought of how
Larose had tracked him down and so nearly brought him to the
scaffold, and often with a large ordnance map of Norfolk before
him his eyes would light up balefully as he ran his fingers in
and out among the little by-roads between the towns and villages
there. Then, too, he would mutter a lot to himself, and his face
was not a pleasant one to see.</p>

<p>He still took cocaine, and now drank copiously of brandy.</p>

<p>Such was his uneventful daily life, and then one morning in
the beginning of April, after a very restless night, he rang for
the butler and announced curtly that he was going away, it might
be for a day, it might be for a week. Then ten minutes later his
amazed domestics, peeping from the kitchen window, saw him drive
off in his car.</p>

<p>That same afternoon, driving his wife and the children back
from Norwich where they had been spending the day, and when not
far from the entrance to the abbey grounds, Larose's heart gave a
great bound as a grey limousine flashed up towards them and then
quickly passed by, for he had thought for the second that its
driver was Bascoigne. He had only, however, had a very fleeting
glimpse of him, and a minute later he believed he must have been
mistaken, for this man was more evil-looking than Bascoigne had
ever been, even upon that night when such violent hands had been
laid upon him at Ingatestone.</p>

<p>But the next afternoon, to his great alarm, Croupin ringing
him up from Norwich, told him excitedly that but a few minutes
ago he had seen Bascoigne coming out of a gun-smith's shop there.
He had, however, not taken in who it was until he had driven the
length of the street, and then it had come to him in a flash that
it was Bascoigne, and Bascoigne clean-shaven!</p>

<p>"And, my dear friend," went on Croupin, "he looks awful now,
with heavy, sodden eyes, and such a wicked looking face."</p>

<p>Larose dismissed the matter quickly, lest his wife should come
into the hall, and asked laughingly how Croupin was enjoying his
honeymoon, whereupon Croupin, who was still in the seventh heaven
of rapture&mdash;he had only been married a fortnight&mdash;gave
him a ten minutes description of Angela's charms, declaring that
with each hour he was finding her the more and more perfect.</p>

<p>The master of Carmel Abbey was very troubled when he hung up
the receiver. It might mean nothing that Bascoigne had been in
the neighbourhood, and yet&mdash;well, they could only wait and
watch.</p>

<p>And they had not long to wait, for three nights later when
Larose and his wife were at dinner, two bullets in quick
succession came crashing through the windows and buried
themselves in the wall. Then came the sounds of a rifle being
fired not very far away.</p>

<p>The butler, an ex-service man, took in the situation like
lightning, and sprang over and switched off the lights.</p>

<p>"Good man!" exclaimed Larose quietly, "but I don't think he'll
dare to fire again." He moved over to his wife's side by the
light of the fire and pressing her hand, added smilingly, "And
that'll be a lesson to us, dear. We'll have dark curtains up
everywhere to-morrow."</p>

<p>Then he darted out to the 'phone and getting through to the
Norwich police told them quickly what had happened. "Don't lose a
minute," he snapped, "and you may perhaps get him. He'll be alone
in a grey limousine."</p>

<p>But although a cordon was instantly thrown all round the main
roads, no grey car containing any such person as Larose had
described was held up that night.</p>

<p>Mrs. Larose bore up bravely and made light of the whole
matter. Larose, however, was in a fever of apprehension about
her, for only a few days previously she had become aware she was
going to have another baby.</p>

<p>That night it was many hours before Larose got to sleep, and
lying by her side and listening to her tranquil breathing he
considered in a thousand ways how he could protect her from
further shocks. He fell asleep at last and dreamed that sitting
wigged and gowned upon the Bench, he was presiding over a Court
of Justice, peopled only, however, with dark shadows.</p>

<p>Nothing more happened the following day and the next and the
next. "And that's all he'll do," said Larose reassuringly to his
wife. "I've found out he's back again in Crowborough, and from
the life he's leading there he'll probably soon break up
altogether. One of his maids tells them in the town that he's
drinking at least two bottles of brandy a day."</p>

<p>Then in the weeks that followed there were no more alarms at
the Abbey, and things went on in just the ordinary way. It was
seen by everyone, however, that the suspense was telling upon its
master, and he made no secret that he was now suffering badly
from insomnia. Often he would go for long walks at night, in the
hope of obtaining a few hours' sleep in the early morning.</p>

<p>Tiring of these lonely walks, he suddenly conceived a passion
for night fishing, and when the tides were favourable would motor
night after night over to Holkham Bay, generally starting
directly dusk had fallen. There he kept a small cutter, and
manning it himself, he would fish for hour after hour, often
indeed until the daylight had almost come. He always went alone,
and was not always successful in catching any fish.</p>

<p>One beautiful night in May, when there was no moon showing,
Mr. Sheldon-Brown was seated at his desk about two o'clock in the
morning, writing in his book. He was writing slowly, for his hand
was rather shaky that night.</p>

<p>He wrote "&mdash;&mdash;for of all my enemies he has proved to
be the worst. But I know that I have made him suffer, even as I
suffered when my fate was hanging upon a single thread. Day and
night his suspense must have been terrible, forever wondering how
and when the next blow would fall. But this cannot go on for
ever, and soon I shall meet him face to face again and
then&mdash;" but he suddenly lifted up his head and began to
sniff violently.</p>

<p>The faint smell of petrol was stealing into the room, and it
seemed to be coming in by the window! A look of dire dismay came
instantly into his face, for knowing there were two 40 gallon
drums of petrol in the garage about a hundred yards away from the
house, he realised in a flash that if the smell were coming from
either of them, then for it to have travelled as far as his study
the drum must be leaking dangerously.</p>

<p>For the moment forgetting all his fears in his anxiety he
stepped quickly across the room, and, unbarring the steel
shutter, opened the long French window. The smell was then
instantly more apparent, and so, with an oath of consternation,
he started to dash over the lawn to the garage, with the smell
getting stronger and stronger with each yard that he covered.</p>

<p>Reaching the garage he flung open the door and, stepping
inside, switched on the lights.</p>

<p>For the moment he was blinded by the glare, but he wrinkled up
his forehead in perplexity, for the smell seemed to have now all
passed away. Then to his amazement he saw that his car had been
moved forward, and as in a dream he caught a lightning glimpse of
a long rope dangling down from one of the rafters at the back of
the garage. He&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><br>
THE same day, just before noon, Larose was walking in the
grounds of Carmel Abbey with his little stepson, Sir Charles
Ardane. He was carrying a letter in his hand, and in a few
minutes he came upon a man on patrol among the trees.</p>

<p>"Here, William," he said, "just take this letter into the
village and post it, please. I'll look after your rifle," but
when the man had gone he left the rifle where it was and wandered
away to try and find some squirrels to show the little boy.</p>

<p>Returning presently to the house, they had just sat down to
lunch when the telephone rang in the hall, and a footman came in
to announce that some one from London wanted his master at once.
Proceeding quickly to the 'phone, Larose picked up the receiver
and then recognising the voice of the Chief Commissioner of
Police, looked back over his shoulder to see if any one were
near.</p>

<p>The Commissioner's voice shook. "That Bascoigne has committed
suicide," he called out excitedly. "Hanged himself in his garage
during the night!"</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed Larose as if he could not believe his
ears, and then he added fervently, "Oh! what a relief!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and that's not all," went on the Commissioner with no
abatement in the excitement of his tones, "for he's left behind
him his life-story that he's written in a book. He admits
everything and actually commences with 'I, Thomas Oscar
Bascoigne!'"</p>

<p>"What!" shouted Larose incredulously; "he's left a confession
behind!"</p>

<p>"No, no, it's not a confession," replied the Commissioner,
"it's a boast. It's a glorification of all he's done, and it's
not finished. He was apparently writing in it, however, just
before he hanged himself."</p>

<p>"But are you sure it's his handwriting?" asked Larose, hardly
able to get his breath.</p>

<p>"Sure," replied the Commissioner instantly, "for I've had both
his solicitors in here and they say it's his, without a doubt.
I've got the book on my desk at this moment, but it'll have to go
back to Crowborough for the inquest to-morrow. You'd better come
up at once and I'll get you also to attend the inquest if you
don't mind."</p>

<p>So, after a short explanation to his wife, who clung tearfully
to him in her overwhelming thanksgiving, Larose set out for
town.</p>

<p>The following morning accompanied by Inspector Reynolds, who
was representing Scotland Yard, Larose went down to Crowborough,
and, along with one of the uniformed constables from the town,
proceeded to inspect the garage where Mr. Brown had hanged
himself. The identity of Larose was not disclosed and the
inspector did all the talking.</p>

<p>The constable was the one who had come up with a detective the
previous morning, directly upon the butler 'phoning up that his
master had hanged himself, and he described exactly what they had
seen upon their arrival.</p>

<p>"Everything is quite clear, sir," he said finally, to the
inspector, "and there can be no doubt about the way he did it. He
brought in that ladder to tie the rope across the beam up there,
and then with the noose round his neck he just jumped off and
dropped." He smiled. "He had calculated very well, too, for his
feet were not eighteen inches above the ground when we found
him."</p>

<p>"Humph!" remarked the inspector, looking up at the beam, "and
did you have to climb up there to get the rope down?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the constable, "for when we had taken off the
noose from the deceased's neck we were able to jerk the other end
of the rope away. It was only tied with a slip-knot over the
beam," and at that moment the butler's wife running into the
garage to announce that the constable was wanted upon the 'phone
the inspector and Larose were left alone.</p>

<p>"These country chaps are always so sure about everything,"
smiled the inspector, "that no wonder we Londoners like to take a
rise out of them," and, picking up the ladder, he propped it up
against the rafter and proceeded to climb quickly up.</p>

<p>"Here, you come up, too," he said after a moment, and upon
Larose complying with his request, he pointed to a little stain
upon the beam close near to where the rope had been tied.</p>

<p>"Looks like a smear of blood to me," he said, "so perhaps he
barked his knuckles when he was tying the rope." He nodded. "At
any rate, I'll find out at the inquest if there were any
abrasions upon either of his hands. It may turn out to be most
important."</p>

<p>A few minutes, later as they were getting into the car to
drive to where the inquest was going to be held, the inspector
asked Larose if he would stop at some hotel on the way. "I've got
a bit of a sore throat," he said, "and as I shall now have to do
some talking about that blood-smear, I think I'll take a drop of
port to ease it. I don't seem to be able to shake it off," he
added. "I caught it three weeks ago fishing on Southend
Pier."</p>

<p>"Oh! a fisherman are you?" asked Larose, as if very
interested. "I'm keen on it, too. I had three days night-fishing
last week."</p>

<p>"Lucky man!" said the inspector enviously. "I can only get a
day very occasionally, and then I never seem to find a place
where there are any fish."</p>

<p>Larose thought for a few moments. "Well, look here,
Inspector," he said. "You were very decent the other day when my
friend was under suspicion at Rostrellor Court, and I'd like to
make you some small return. What about getting a week's leave
next month and coming down with your wife to Carmel Abbey when
Mrs. Larose and I are alone? The whiting will be biting then and
I'll give you some good sport. No, nonsense, man, and if you do
find you're drinking port over 50 years old, and a footman is
standing behind you, remember I was only a policeman, too, and it
isn't three years since I left the Force."</p>

<p>The Inspector's face glowed with pleasure. What a feather in
his cap he thought, and how interested they would all be at the
Yard! It was believed that Larose lived like a lord at Carmel
Abbey, and what a time he, Henry Reynolds, would have!</p>

<p>He accepted the invitation at once and thanked Larose warmly.
Then when Larose allowed him to pay for the port wine they both
had he thought the ex-detective was quite the finest fellow in
the world.</p>

<p>The inquest was held in a large room adjoining the mortuary,
and the coroner, a quick, sharp-looking man, was soon seen to be
most business-like in his methods of conducting the
proceedings.</p>

<p>The constable and the local detective were the first witnesses
called, and they both stated what they found when they had
arrived at the garage, and then gave it as their emphatic opinion
that to all appearances the deceased had undoubtedly hanged
himself.</p>

<p>The police surgeon of the district, who, along with a brother
practitioner, had performed the autopsy, came next. He was an
elderly man, and looked tired and overworked, as indeed he was.
He told the court he had seen the body before it was cut down,
and there was no doubt it was a case of self-destruction. The
neck was broken between the third and fourth vertebrae, and death
would have been instantaneous. The deceased was not a healthy
person, for the heart was very much dilated and the liver partly
cirrhosed.</p>

<p>He gave his evidence quickly, as if he were anxious to get it
over and, had the truth been known, he had been equally as
expeditious with the post-mortem, and in consequence had not
noticed a slight extravasation of blood under the skin at the
back of the head.</p>

<p>"If you don't bother him with any questions," whispered Larose
to the inspector, "it may be all over in time for us to get away
to the one o'clock lunch at the 'Crown' and then we'll have some
much better port than that we had this morning." He passed his
hand over his face. "I've got a bit of a headache and feel tired
and hungry."</p>

<p>The inspector nodded and sat back. Certainly, after that
invitation to Carmel Abbey, he was not going to cross Larose in
any way, and besides, that it was a case of suicide seemed
perfectly clear, and he was bored with the proceedings, the like
of which he had listened to many hundreds of times before.</p>

<p>The last witness was the butler, Alec MacTavish, and he
related cautiously all that he knew. He had happened to wake up
during the night at ten minutes to three, he said, and had
noticed from his bedroom window that the lights were burning in
the garage. He had remarked then to his wife that it was a great
waste of money, but he had not gone out to switch them off
because his master was always very angry at interference of any
kind. So he had got back into bed and gone off to sleep
again.</p>

<p>Yes, his master had been behaving very queerly lately, and
drinking heavily, too. He really had not seemed to be in his
right mind. He often sniffed, too, at that white powder in the
bottle that had been exhibited, and was now upon the table there.
That was all he, MacTavish, had to tell, and if his master had
not died, he had been intending to give notice immediately, for
things had begun to get on his nerves.</p>

<p>The coroner summed up very briefly. There was no doubt, he
said, that the deceased had taken his own life, and a heavy
drinker and a drug-addict&mdash;they had heard from the doctor
that that white powder was a deadly poison, cocaine&mdash;it was
not surprising that he had done so in a sudden fit of depression.
As they had heard, he had taken off his coat and, folding it
neatly, put it on one side along with his collar, his tie, and
his shoes, which, strange to say, was a proceeding very often
noticed in people who took their own lives. The deceased had left
behind him a sort of diary&mdash;he held up the book here for
every one to see&mdash;but although its contents were of great
importance they were not relevant to the inquiry and it was not
for him, the coroner, to disclose their nature.</p>

<p>He advised the jury to bring in the customary verdict of
suicide during a fit of temporary insanity, which they at once
did, and the proceedings terminated in time for Larose and the
inspector to hurry away for the one o'clock luncheon at the Crown
Hotel.</p>

<p>The newspaper had a great sale that evening, announcing in
huge headlines the suicide of Sheldon-Brown, but they were not in
all their glory until two days later, when the contents of
Bascoigne's life story, as written line by line, was given to the
Press. Then the flags went up with a vengeance, and Larose was
not a little gratified by a big headline in the 'Daily Cry,'
'Entire Vindication of Gilbert Larose,' followed by a line in
smaller type. 'The great international detective's reputation
restored to its pedestal. Still the man who never fails!'</p>

<p>The story was most enlightening in its details, and besides
giving the inner history of the crash of Bascoigne's last
financial venture, it went fully into how he had first come to
meet his co-conspirators and how their vengeance had been later
carried out.</p>

<p>Incidentally the authorities were enabled to assure themselves
of its trustworthiness by its mentioning of many things they had
not learnt and the truth of which they were able to immediately
verify. For instance, that the hat of Anthony Clutterbuck had
been thrust down behind a groyne upon the wall of Canvey Island,
and that the rifle with which Lord Burkington had been shot had
been hidden in a rabbit-warren just behind his house.</p>

<p>In the meantime, armed with a search warrant, four detectives,
under Inspector Reynolds, had made a lightning descent upon the
domicile of the only juryman who had refused to agree to a
verdict of guilty at the last trial and whom Bascoigne had
recorded in his book as having received a bribe of &pound;2000.
They were accompanied by a woman searcher.</p>

<p>They had expected an easy prey, but not a little to their
surprise were met by a furious and truculent individual who swore
well and truly, with one adjective many times repeated, that it
was all a lie that he had ever received a penny-piece from any
one.</p>

<p>"Here, search that, you"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"you
gentlemen," he shouted, taking off his ragged coat and throwing
it into the arms of one of the detectives, "and keep all the
fivers you find in the pockets for yourselves." His voice was
like the bellowing of a bull. "Me with two thousand quid, and
owing six weeks' rent to my crimson landlord!" He pointed to the
mantelpiece. "And there's a summons for &pound;2/14/6 from the
ruddy grocer up the street."</p>

<p>Then when he learnt that the woman with them was a searcher,
he began to cast off more garments, with the grinning intimation
that she could start at once upon him.</p>

<p>The house and the little yard at the back were gone through
most minutely, but no money was found anywhere, and everything
suggested the border-line of abject poverty.</p>

<p>Then, when after a couple of hours of hard searching the
detectives were proceeding to leave, the man shouted at them.</p>

<p>"And you'll be keeping an eye on me, will you?" He laughed
scornfully. "Well, I'll tell you exactly what I shall be doing
for the next few days. To-morrow I'll be carting coals for old
Stuckey round the corner; on Friday I'll be working in the
market, and on Saturday"&mdash;he looked pleasant for the first
time&mdash;"if I've got a bob or two, I'll go down to Kempton
Park and make a couple of quid. I know a brute that's going to
win at twenty to one."</p>

<p>Then when at last the front door was closed behind them, he
wiped over his forehead with his shirt sleeve and grinned at his
now smiling wife. "Whew!" he ejaculated in great relief, "but
that was a close shave!" He shook his finger warningly at her.
"But I told you we should have to be blasted careful for a long
while, and now there'll be no going near Mother's for a good
month, and we won't shift from here for another three."</p>

<p>He picked up the coat he had thrown at the detective and,
abstracting a well-folded piece of dirty newspaper from one of
the pockets, drew out a one pound Treasury note from among six or
seven others. "Here," he said, handing it over to her, "go and
get some fish and chips and a couple of bottles of stout," and
then when she was putting on her hat he proceeded to roll himself
a cigarette, humming softly, but in very jubilant tone, "A boy's
best friend is his mother."</p>

<p><br>
INSPECTOR REYNOLDS and his wife had their week at Carmel Abbey
and both enjoyed themselves immensely.</p>

<p>Upon the night of their arrival the inspector and his host
were smoking in the lounge when the former remarked laughingly.
"Oh! I've got something very curious to tell you, and I'm sure
you'll be interested. Last Sunday four of us made up a little
party to go down to Bexhill, and we stopped for a drink at
Tunbridge Wells. In the bar of the hotel were a lot of country
chaps yarning together, and presently that inquest upon Bascoigne
cropped up. One man then said it was a scandal the way it had
been hurried through, with no help being given by us up at the
Yard. Then he went on to tell an extraordinary tale that he said
was going all about Crowborough. According to him, that Scotch
butler had got hold of Bascoigne's book one day long before he
hanged himself and, making a copy of several pages, had sent them
up to London, to the police."</p>

<p>"Great Scot! What a tale!" commented Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on the inspector, "and he said we were all
furious, for even with this proof of the man's guilt in our very
hands, we could not touch him, because we knew he could not be
tried again upon the same charge." He grinned. "So what did we
do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," smiled Larose. "Suggested that he should hang
himself, perhaps!"</p>

<p>"No," said the inspector with his eyes twinkling, "but we just
waited for the opportunity and then hanged him ourselves." He
nodded. "Yes, this chap said that for weeks and weeks before the
supposed suicide a phantom motor car had been often noticed in
the dead of night going up and down the lanes near Bascoigne's
house. It never showed any lights and used to crawl so slowly
that it hardly made any sound." He shook a big fat finger. "And,
by Jove, that wasn't all!"</p>

<p>"Gosh!" exclaimed Larose, pretending to be very awe-struck,
"then some one actually saw Bascoigne being hanged?"</p>

<p>"No," laughed the Inspector, "but the young fellow who was
telling the story went on to say that he'd been present at the
inquest, and had noticed something that no one else had done, and
it was this." He lowered his voice impressively. "When the rope
with which Bascoigne had hanged himself was being exhibited to
the jury in the court, he had seen that the noose had been tied
in a certain peculiar way, with the true hangman's knot at the
back, so that the neck would break in exactly the right
place."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Larose with a smile, "he noticed that, did he?
He was a sharp fellow."</p>

<p>"Yes," continued the inspector, "and he said that not one
person in a million would know what a hangman's knot was, but he
did, because it so happened his uncle was a warder at the Old
Bailey, and had often showed him how they tied one." He leant
back looking very amused. "Now, what do you think of the story,
Mr. Larose?"</p>

<p>For a long moment Larose regarded the inspector very
thoughtfully, and then replied with perfect seriousness: "I
should think it's quite true"&mdash;his face hardened&mdash;"and
if it isn't, it ought to be, for Bascoigne was a public enemy,
and his hanging by any one would have been justice and not
murder." He smiled his most pleasant smile. "I would have done it
myself with the greatest of pleasure if I had been allowed
to."</p>
