<h3>THE STORY</h3>

<p class="first">A young and beautiful wife, happily married, is
hiding two secrets of which she is determined her husband must
never learn. The one man who discovers these secrets and
threatens exposure meets with death under mysterious
circumstances, and she is suspected of murder.</p>

<p>Then Gilbert Larose, Scotland Yard's most famous detective,
intervenes. But, although Larose becomes convinced of the
innocence of a courageous woman and dramatically learns the truth
about her past, even he is unable to unmask the killer. It is not
until the very end of this most ingenious of Arthur Gask's many
thrillers that the identity of the murderer is revealed.</p>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I.<br>

THE CHILD OF THE SLUM.</h2>

<p class="first">I HAVE just seen my babies put to bed and made
cosy for the night. I know I could not have two better nurses
looking after them, but my own childhood was so hard and lacking
in affection that I am perhaps over-anxious to be sure that my
own children do not want for love and tenderness. My dear
husband laughs at me, but I know it pleases him that, with all
my social duties, the children always come first.</p>

<p>Today is my twenty-eighth birthday and I know I shall never be
able to take in as fully as I should what wonderful things have
happened to me from my early teens onwards. Still, all my life
has been wonderful, as it can be little short of a miracle that,
with the truly dreadful promise of my early days, I should have
come to my present very prosperous and happy position.</p>

<p>Certainly I am a most fortunate woman, as life could surely be
giving me no greater happiness than it is giving now. I have a
husband who loves and respects me as much as any husband could
love and respect his wife, I have two lovely children, and we are
happily situated, socially and financially. Last year I had the
thrill of being presented at Court.</p>

<p>If, too, I am not by any means a beautiful woman, I am
grateful for other qualities which are equally desirable. My
husband declares that I possess the rare gift of charm, derived,
he says, half seriously, half whimsically, from the French family
of the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i> from which I am supposed to be
descended.</p>

<p>Yet&mdash;I was born in a London slum, my mother had been a
general servant and my father was, and indeed still is, a keeper
in one of the animal houses of Max's Menagerie.</p>

<p>My so humble origin is one of the two deeply buried secrets of
my life, and my dear husband, least of all, must never learn
them. Thank Heaven, he never will now, as all save one who could
give me away are dead. Strangely enough, this one who still lives
is my own father, but he has quite forgotten me and probably does
not even imagine that I any longer exist.</p>

<p>For a long time, however, he was a great anxiety to me, as
there was always the nagging fear at the back of my mind that one
day we might meet somewhere, perhaps in the street, and he would
stop me and call out, "Hullo, you're my daughter, Polly, aren't
you?" Oh, how awful it would have been and in time the very
thought of it so came to haunt me that at last I determined I
would put it to the test.</p>

<p>I went to the Menagerie to see if he were still there and
found that he was. Though all those years had passed and he was
much altered, I recognised him at once. I did not dare then to
approach him close, but kept well away. Still, I knew I should
have no real peace of mind until I was sure he would not
recognise me, and so, a few days later, made a little party of
friends and we went to the Menagerie to see the big African
lioness, whom we had read in the newspapers had just had twin
cubs.</p>

<p>Going into the Lions' House, I saw my father standing in front
of one of the cages and, with my heart beating painfully and my
legs shaking under me, forced myself to go up to him and ask if
we could see the new cubs. He looked at me uninterestedly and,
nodding curtly, took us round to the back of the cages and shewed
them to us. After we had duly admired them, I gave him a
half-crown as a tip and he thanked me with a blank look of no
recognition. Oh, how relieved I was! Since then I have never
given him another thought, and he doesn't deserve one either, as
he was a bad father to me and an even worse husband to my
mother.</p>

<p>Still I am quite sure that were everything known about me many
would say that I have been both bad and wicked myself, but I do
insist that with all my faults I have never wilfully brought pain
or sorrow upon anyone. Wherever, too, I have sinned against the
conventions of our times, it is I who have been the sufferer and
no one else. Speaking there, however, it is not for nothing that
woman has been always called the weaker sex. As long as time was
she has been the natural prey of Man and if, in temptation, it
has happened she has been strong enough to resist her
inclinations&mdash;then to most people that very strength will
have detracted not a little from those endearing qualities which
are both the crown and glory of her sex.</p>

<p>My life-story is an unusual one.</p>

<p>I was born in Rocker Street, a dreadful squalid little street
in Camden Town, upon July the tenth, nineteen hundred and three,
and I was known as Polly Wiggs. Our house was the poorest and
most mean-looking of all the miserable ones there, and as a
child, I remember we had very little furniture, with what there
was being so worn-out and shabby that even in my very early years
I was always ashamed for anyone to come inside.</p>

<p>Directly I was old enough to take notice of things I came to
realise what a disgrace my father was to us. Upon his weekly 'off
days' when he was not wearing his keeper's uniform he went about
unshaven and unwashed and with no collar or tie. I don't think he
ever washed anywhere except his hands or face; the smell of the
animals he looked after at the Menagerie always clung to him.
Upon entering our house I could always tell whether he was at
home or not by the smell in the passage. He drank a lot and spent
most of his wages in the public-house. As I grew up he took no
interest in me except to slap me hard whenever he could make out
that I had done something wrong, and I came to hate and avoid him
as much as possible.</p>

<p>My poor mother was a most unhappy woman, always tired and
always complaining. She had good cause for complaining, as with
my father's drinking habits we were always short of money, always
in debt and with the landlord continually threatening to turn us
out.</p>

<p>Before her marriage she must have been pretty in a dolly sort
of way, but worry, chronic ill-health and an almost annual
child-bearing had aged her very early and, taking no pride in her
appearance, at thirty she looked many years older than she really
was. Happily, perhaps, for my little brothers and sisters, they
never lived long, infantile diseases generally taking them off in
the first year. Such mortality was not unusual in Rocker Street
and was symptomatic of the conditions of life for so many of the
poorer classes in the early years of this century.</p>

<p>So, when I was about twelve years old and my mother stopped
having babies, I was the only child, and I remember so well what
I looked like then. As I went to and from school every day I used
always to take a glimpse at myself in the big mirror in the
window of the barber's shop, and saw a pale-faced, skinny,
weedy-looking little horror, with hollow cheeks and eyes seeming
to occupy the greater part of her face.</p>

<p>Still, as I came to realise later, if I were indeed
weedy-looking, there must yet have been something of the vitality
of the strong unwanted weed about me, as I flourished while so
many of the other children in the street sickened and died.
Croup, measles, scarlet fever and other children's ailments
passed me by and, ill-nourished as I undoubtedly was, diseases of
malnutrition got no hold upon me. I remember, I was proud, too,
that while so many of the other children had warped and crooked
little bodies mine was as straight as a willow.</p>

<p>Certainly, no one would have called me pretty then, but the
woman at the sweet-shop where I used to spend a very occasional
'halfpenny' told me once over a small wrapping of acid drops
that, when I grew up and my face filled out, my eyes would be
lovely. She said, too, the shape of my face would one day make a
lot of girls envious. I came to be quite a favourite with her and
sometimes, when I had nothing to spend and she saw me looking at
the good things in her window, she would darkly beckon me inside
and give me a farthing sugar-stick. Then I thought she was the
kindest woman in all the world.</p>

<p>At the Board School I attended I didn't get on as well as I
should have done, as I was generally not interested in much which
they taught me. Still, with any effort, I could always beat all
the other girls in poetry and reading. I remember one of the
teachers saying once that when I like I could be as sharp as a
weasel, but I was too what she called apathetic to bestir myself.
She didn't take in that I was always hungry and my poor little
stomach never more than half-filled. Often for breakfast, all I
had was a slice of bread and a scrape of dripping on it, and a
cup of almost milkless tea. Milk by itself was a very rare
treat.</p>

<p>With the other girls at the school, I was very unpopular, as I
kept myself as aloof as possible and made no friends. It was not
that I would not have liked to have friends, but, with the
cruelty of children, they were always jeering at me about my
shabby clothes. Certainly my clothes were dreadful. Always of the
cheapest and poorest quality they would become in time so patched
and darned that it was a wonder they held together. Then, when at
last as a matter of dire necessity I had to have something new or
be unable to go to school, my father always quarrelled with my
mother about it and would slap me angrily for having, as he
insisted, played so roughly that no clothes would stand the
resulting wear and tear.</p>

<p>Altogether, my school days were most unhappy ones and I slunk
through them an unhappy, unwanted and ostracised little leper.
Even now, I shudder when I think of my miserable childhood, and
wonder its cruelty did not leave its mark upon me all my life.
Looking back, I really think I was saved from that by my becoming
so callous to the wretchedness of my surroundings that I let it
pass over me like the proverbial water on a duck's back.</p>

<p>At any rate, better times were coming to me and at fourteen,
just half my number of years now, I started upon a new life, the
turning-point, as I realise now. I left school and went out as a
daily girl at, what was considered then a good wage, eighteen
pence a day to a childless widow who ran a small newspaper
business and 'tuppenny library' in the Camden Road.</p>

<p>From the beginning she was very kind to me and, out of pity I
am sure, at once took a great interest in the gawky, awkward and
uneducated girl whom she was now employing. She had been a
school-teacher once and, with nice gentle manners, always spoke
most grammatically and in refined and educated tones.</p>

<p>"But, my child," she said to me when I had only been with her
a day or two, "why do you talk so horribly? There's no need to.
You've got a nicely-modulated voice if you use it properly and
from your face I can tell you are something of a little actress,
too. So, try straightaway to improve yourself or you'll never get
on in life."</p>

<p>Anxious to do everything she wanted, I did try, at first
almost as a joke, but very soon I was taking a great pride in it
and she became so very pleased with me. After a few weeks with
her, to talk quietly and pronounce my words correctly without
dropping any aitches became quite the natural thing. Even my
father noticed it. "Play-acting now, are you?" he scowled. "Then
the way we brought you up ain't good enough for you?" but my
mother bade him be quiet and said that if I spoke nicely it would
mean more money coming in. That silenced him, as some of my
weekly money always went his way for beer.</p>

<p>My employer became particular, too, about my hands and,
telling me they were pretty ones and might easily belong to an
artist, made me take care of them and see they never became rough
and red. Also, making out it was a sort of uniform to serve in
the tuppenny library, she bought me a new dress of, to me at all
events, amazing quality. She accompanied it with the gift of a
pair of shoes.</p>

<p>Making my father's acquaintance once when he called me to the
shop door one evening to get some money off me, she was so
shocked at his general appearance that the next day she suggested
I should come to 'live in' with her. I was to have food and
lodging and &pound;26 a year. I jumped at her offer and,
accordingly visited our squalid home only for a short time on
Sunday afternoons.</p>

<p>By now everyone was noticing my so altered appearance and the
girls who had been at school with me had taken to calling after
me in the street as 'the duchess.' Sex was raw in Rocker Street
and my mother said that some of them were even suggesting I was
being kept by a man. Boys now tried to catch my eye, but thank
Heaven I had no interest in them and my nature was to remain cold
and unresponsive for many years after.</p>

<p>When I had been with the widow about eighteen months no one
would have recognised in me the scraggy girl who had first come
to her. With the so-much better food and the happy surroundings
my face and figure had filled out and I was no longer thin and
pale. Attending upon the customers, too, had given me confidence
and altogether I was feeling a very important young woman.</p>

<p>Again, the books I read, and my employer made me read every
new one she bought so as to be able to advise the borrowers which
one to choose, opened up a new world to me and I started
day-dreaming and building castles in the air, situated very far
away, however, from Camden Town.</p>

<p>Still, all this happiness was not to last, as my poor mother
died suddenly from heart failure and my father said I must come
back home and keep house for him. My mother's death came as a
terrible shock to me, for though I had never loved her very much
and there never had been any real confidences between us, of late
years I had been feeling intensely sorry for her in the dull and
dreary life she lived.</p>

<p>I should have fought hard against returning to Rocker Street
except for two things. The first, my father insisted that as I
was under sixteen I could not leave him without his permission,
and threatened me with the police if I did not do as he ordered.
I was very frightened of the police, always associating them in
my mind with the struggling and shouting that ensued when they
descended upon Rocker Street to arrest a fighting drunk.</p>

<p>The second thing, my grief at leaving the library was
mitigated a lot by learning that in any case my benefactor and I
would have had to part. She was selling the business to go to
live with a brother of hers in Aberdeen who had just lost his
wife. For a parting present she gave me five beautiful golden
sovereigns, with the stern injunction that I was not on any
account to let my father get hold of them.</p>

<p>A fortnight back in Rocker Street proved as much as I could
put up with, and I made up my mind to run away. I told myself
that, at any rate to begin with, I would take the first situation
offered me and go anywhere where the police would not be able to
find me.</p>

<p>So, one morning, leaving a note for my father to read when he
came home at night, saying I had heard of a good place in
Scotland, I took a train going almost in the very opposite
direction and arrived at Torquay, in the West of England, the
same afternoon. With my heart beating a little faster at the
thought that for the first time in my life I was now alone, I
walked boldly into a cheap temperance hotel and enquired the
price of a room. I was told it would be half a crown including
breakfast.</p>

<p>Out early the next morning to buy a newspaper, I saw an
advertisement in the <i>Western Morning News</i> that a girl was
wanted for general housework in the country and, to my great joy,
application for the situation was to be made at an address in
Torre, a suburb of Torquay. Within an hour I was being
interviewed by the advertiser whom I found was a Colonel Jasper,
an amiable and pleasant-looking old gentleman of a much better
class than any I had up to then been brought in contact with.</p>

<p>He asked me a lot of questions and, it struck me he seemed
pleased I had come from London only the previous day and knew no
one in Torquay. I fibbed that both my parents were dead and I had
no relations at all. Also, I put my age on two years and told him
I was nearly eighteen. Asked what references I could give, I said
none at all, as my previous employer who had kept a small lending
library had died just recently.</p>

<p>After staring at me for quite a long minute, he seemed
satisfied and said he would give me a trial. "But I must tell
you," he added, "that on Dartmoor where you will live it is very
lonely. You will find no Town amusements there, no pictures or
anything like that, and you won't see many people either. Still
it is very healthy and the scenery is very wonderful. Your wages
will be &pound;18 a year." I was delighted. This was exactly what
I wanted. However long the arm of the police, I thought it could
hardly reach me there.</p>

<p>It was arranged I should meet him the next morning at nine
o'clock upon the platform of Torre Railway Station and we were to
take the train to Bovey Tracey, a small town about fourteen miles
up the line close to where the road starts to climb up on to the
moor. I found him waiting for me and took good stock of him
again. He was wearing breeches and leggings which were anything
but new, and a leather motoring overcoat which from the
oil-stains upon it had evidently seen good service.</p>

<p>When the train drew in it was nearly full, with us having to
occupy the last vacant seats in a carriage. Accordingly, no
conversation took place between us on the journey and I was not
sorry for it, as I was interested in a book he had bought for me
at the station bookstall. It was all about Dartmoor and I was
thrilled at learning to what a mysterious place I was going.</p>

<p>The book said the moor was all that remained now of a once
mighty volcano which millions of years ago had heaved up great
masses of molten rock to remain as the tors of today. With a
circumference of under fifty miles, it rose abruptly from the
surrounding country to heights varying between two and three
thousand feet above sea-level. It was studded nearly all over its
wide expanse with these big tors whose clefts and crannies were
the last home of the deadly viper, the one remaining poisonous
snake of the British Isles. Less than two hundred years ago, too,
wolves were to be seen roaming on its uplands.</p>

<p>The book went on to state that for many centuries the moor had
had something of an evil reputation, as history recorded that
human sacrifices had once been offered up upon the tors. Even
today it was believed by many of the superstitious dwellers round
the countryside that the ghosts of the violent dead still haunted
the moor, and upon nights when the moon was full would creep out
from their hiding-places under the tors and attack human beings
who had been unwary enough to come their way.</p>

<p>In summer, it said the moor was well-favoured by picnic
parties and tourists, but, even then straying far from the only
two roads crossing it its many stretches of dangerous bog-land
always constituted something of a menace to the unwary as they
were deep and treacherous, with their surfaces easily mistaken
for solid ground. From time to time wandering cattle and moorland
ponies had been actually seen to disappear in them within the
course of a very few minutes. The danger of walking into those
bogs was all the greater because of sudden mists and fogs which,
even upon a bright summer day, might sweep down, apparently from
nowhere and quickly blot out all visibility beyond a few
yards.</p>

<p>Such was what I had been reading and in a way, I was quite
sorry when the train reached Bovey Tracey and I had to put the
book down. Colonel Jasper said he wanted to go into the town to
make a few purchases as well as pick up his car, but I was to
wait for him in the small hotel near the railway station. He took
me in there by the private door and I sat down in the hall to
wait until he was ready. He went out again by the same door
through which we had entered.</p>

<p>I was expecting to be very bored by the waiting, but, as it
happened, the chair I had chosen was close to a door which was
slightly ajar and hearing voices very near to me, I peered
cautiously round to find I was looking straight into the hotel
bar. Besides the barman, there were two customers, young fellows
in the late twenties with all the appearance of returned soldiers
about them, and I guessed that the motor-cycling outfit I had
noticed standing outside the hotel belonged to them. They looked
very different from the barman who was a round-faced
simple-looking man of middle age.</p>

<p>All at once I heard Colonel Jasper's name mentioned. It was
the barman speaking in his soft Devonshire drawl. "Yes, as you
say, he looks," he remarked, "an eccentric character. For one
thing he lives in a lonely old place in the very heart of the
moor miles away from anywhere."</p>

<p>"You mean he's got a shack there," asked one of the young
fellows, "a sort of holiday home?"</p>

<p>The barman guffawed. "Shack be damned! Why, it's a big stone
house of two stories with a fenced-in yard and plenty of
out-buildings. It was built by the Government some fifty to sixty
years ago. They had some cracked idea of sinking shafts all round
to discover&mdash;well Heaven only knows exactly what. However,
they soon dropped the idea and the house was shut up and left to
go to wrack and ruin."</p>

<p>"Does he live there alone?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"No, he's got two Indian servants with him, an old man and his
wife." The barman laughed. "All old codgers up there, and we call
it the old folks home."</p>

<p>"But how on earth does he pass the time?" asked the
motor-cyclist curiously.</p>

<p>"Writes books about old gold coins," replied the barman, "and
we've heard tell he got one of the finest collections of them in
the kingdom. Then he goes fishing a lot, and watches the stars.
Oh, yes, he's got plenty of money. Last year he had a big
telescope built into the roof of the house and three men came all
the way from London to fix it."</p>

<p>"But isn't he afraid of being robbed?"</p>

<p>"Not he," laughed the barman. "He's been a big-game hunter all
over the world and is afraid of nothing. He's a tough old guy.
Besides, he's got a couple of big savage dogs up there with him,
Alsatians, and they keep everybody away."</p>

<p>All the time I was seeing and hearing everything exactly as if
I were in the bar itself. One of the motor-cyclists had changed
his seat, so that while he was talking, he could keep his eye on
his motor-cycle through the window. This had brought him so near
to me that by stretching out my hand I could almost have touched
him. However, the dim light in the little narrow hall made me
feel quite safe and I was thrilled at learning anything about my
employer. Of the conversation which followed, too, even after all
these years I can recall almost everything which was said, as it
seemed so much like a fairy tale to me that it left its lasting
impression upon my mind.</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw the other young fellow move up to the bar
counter. "Here, Gov'nor," he said, "have a pint with me, and tell
us more about those dogs and the old gentleman. I'm quite
interested as I'm a newspaper man and might make a good story out
of it."</p>

<p>The barman drew himself a pint, and filled the other's glass.
They chin-chined together and the journalist asked, "Has the old
chap been there long?"</p>

<p>"Four or five years," said the barman, "and before him there
was an artist fellow, but he didn't last long. When he rented the
place from the Government he told everyone all he wanted was
peace and quiet." He banged his fist upon the table. "By hell, he
got it, too, as one day he disappeared and not a blooming trace
of him was found afterwards. Some think he slipped into Fowler's
Bog, near by, but we round here believe the warlocks got him and,
carried him away."</p>

<p>"Warlocks!" exclaimed the journalist, looking very puzzled.
"What are they?"</p>

<p>The barman nodded darkly. "Evil spirits which haunt the moor,
ghosts of those poor devils who were killed as sacrifices on the
tors those hundreds and hundreds of years ago."</p>

<p>"But you don't mean to tell me," frowned the journalist, "that
there are actually people who believe in such things now?"</p>

<p>"My oath, I do," exclaimed the barman emphatically. "There are
lots of us round here who believe in them, just as our ancestors
did long generations back. It's in the moorland blood and we
can't drive it out of us." He laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we may go to church on a Sunday and sing hymns and
pray and say our prayers and all that, but you offer us a fiver
to go to certain places on the moor when the moon is full and you
just see how we'll look at you. You'll have to put your fiver
back in your pocket every time."</p>

<p>"And you've got this moorland blood yourself," asked the
journalist. "You wouldn't take the fiver if I offered it?"</p>

<p>The barman shook his head. "No, I just wouldn't." He flushed
up a bit. "I know I've never seen one of those bad spirits
myself, but my old grandfather did. He died a couple of years
back at ninety-seven and I've many a time heard him tell how one
of them nearly got him when he was a young chap."</p>

<p>"You mean he actually saw it?" asked the journalist.</p>

<p>"Actually saw it!" exclaimed the barman. "Why, man it almost
seized hold of him and it was touch and go that he escaped. It
had taken the form of a dark man, with a long white face and
black hair right down on to his shoulders. My grand-dad says it
glared at him and its eyes seemed to pierce right through
him."</p>

<p>He spoke so earnestly that, although I thought it all
nonsense, yet I could feel my legs shaking. I saw the journalist
wink at his companion. "And where did all this happen?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"On the main road right on top of the moor," said the barman,
"just before you turn off to where this old colonel lives. My
grand-dad said it was all bad luck, as he was caught out late
just as it had got dark and the moon rose. His pony had gone lame
and he couldn't ride it. So he was walking beside it, when all of
a sudden this dark man sprang out of the ground and stretched out
his hands which my grand-dad says were like claws."</p>

<p>The barman seemed quite affected by his story and there was a
catch in his breath as he went on. "Grand-dad knew what he was up
against at once, and fortunately kept his head. He made the sign
of the cross with his forefinger and ran for his life. He ran all
the way until he got home and then it took half a bottle of old
brandy to revive him."</p>

<p>"But couldn't this evil spirit run faster than he did?" asked
the journalist, as if wanting to draw him on.</p>

<p>The barman pounded again with his fist upon the counter. "Yes,
of course it could, but my grand-dad's pony saved him! The spirit
stopped to drain his blood. My grand-dad heard the poor brute's
dying screams. No one ever saw the pony again."</p>

<p>"But how is it?" asked the journalist sarcastically, "that
this old colonel and his servants can live up there unharmed with
these evil spirits haunting round so close to them as you
say?"</p>

<p>"We think, for one thing," said the barman earnestly, "it's
because these two servants of his may be something of bad spirits
themselves. They're not Christians and keep to the heathen gods
where they come from. One of these gods is a snake and called
Siva, the Destroyer."</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious!" exclaimed the journalist, looking very
amused. "How did you find out that?"</p>

<p>"Jan Hedden, who used to live here," said the barman, "told us
all about it. You see, he was a tradesman in this town, and one
day just afore Christmas he went up to 'The Grey
House'&mdash;that's the name of the colonel's place&mdash;to mend
a leak they'd got in the roof. While he was having his dinner, a
darned good one with plenty of cider, he said, the old woman
started to talk to him and she talked to him a lot. She's a
sorceress, right enough!"</p>

<p>"A sorceress!" exclaimed the journalist. "That's funny, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"It's more than funny," scowled the barman. "It's damned
wicked. She read his future for him and told him he hadn't long
to live. Jan laughed at her, as we all did when he told us,
because he was as healthy as a trout and could down a gallon of
cider in about ten minutes." He nodded very solemnly. "But Jan
died three weeks later. He got pneumonia from digging out a fox
one cold Monday afternoon and the parson buried him on the Sunday
following."</p>

<p>"Dreadful, dreadful!" exclaimed the journalist. "And you think
she made him die?"</p>

<p>"Certain of it," nodded the barman. "She did it to show her
power." He shook his head savagely. "And if the law had allowed
it we'd have gone up in a mob and burnt her as a witch. Jan was a
fine fellow and well liked."</p>

<p>"But speaking quite seriously," said the journalist, "and not
wanting to laugh because we Londoners don't understand such
things, are there really many round the moorside who believe as
you do? Now tell me straight."</p>

<p>"There are many," said the barman with the utmost seriousness,
"but generally we don't talk about it, and I oughtn't to have
done so now. I tell you it's in our blood and we can't help
it."</p>

<p>Evidently to keep things going, the journalist here suggested
another pint of beer, but this time the barman said he'd prefer a
double brandy, as talking about evil spirits had made his stomach
queer. The brandy was downed in one gulp and the journalist went
on with the conversation.</p>

<p>"You say these dogs the old man's got are very savage?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, very," said the barman, "and we know they're sheep
killers. All the farmers round here would just love to have the
law put on the colonel and get a magistrate's order to have the
dogs destroyed, but the devil of it is that, though so many of
them have had sheep killed in the night, they've never yet
managed to get the actual proof that his dogs were the killers. A
couple of weeks ago Harry Baker was sure he had got it at last,
but the evidence, once again, all fizzled out."</p>

<p>"And how was that?" asked the journalist. "It'll fit in well
with my story."</p>

<p>"It was early on a Sunday morning," said the barman, "and,
just as it was beginning to get light, Harry&mdash;he's a farmer
up Lustleigh way just a couple of miles from here&mdash;was woke
up by hearing his dog starting to bark like fury. He whipped on
his trousers and boots and ran out to loose his animal off the
chain. It was a misty morning and in the half light he couldn't
see far, but he swears he caught sight of a big brute of a dog
just vanishing out of sight. He unchained his own dog and it
picked up the strange scent at once and was off like an arrow.
Then to Harry's great uneasiness, everything went quiet again and
his dog didn't come back. Daylight came on in a few minutes and,
the mist clearing a bit, what do you think he saw?"</p>

<p>"One thing, for sure," nodded the journalist, "his own dog was
dead."</p>

<p>The barman nodded back. "With its throat almost torn out.
Then, within a hundred yards or so, he saw five of his best ewes
had been served in the same way. Now Harry's always a quick
worker and, within ten minutes, he had routed out the local
policeman, taken him to see the slaughtered sheep and, with him
in his car, was racing like blazes up to 'The Grey House.'"</p>

<p>"And what happened?" asked the journalist, because the barman
had tantalisingly stopped speaking.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he grinned, "except that they found both the
Alsatians there with the colonel giving them their breakfast of
bread and milk. Neither of them showed any signs of sweat or
blood and it was certain they had not left the place all
night."</p>

<p>The journalist laughed and, looking at his watch, rose up to
go. "Thanks for the story, old chap," he said, "and here's half a
dollar for it. We must be off. Goodbye."</p>

<p>I was disappointed to see them go but another customer
immediately took their place. "Two journalists from London,"
remarked the barman to the newcomer, as the motor-cycle was being
ridden away.</p>

<p>"Journalists, my eye!" commented the other. "They come from
London right enough, but they're street bookies in Whitechapel
Road, and I had a bet or two with them when I was up there last
month. I recognised them at once. The good-looking one with the
moustache is called Tod Bellamy and his reputation's not too
good. They say he's been in quod for burglary, only a little
while ago."</p>

<p>I didn't hear any more of the conversation as at that moment
the hall door opened and Colonel Jasper beckoned me out.</p>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.<br>

THE HOUSE ON THE MOOR</h2>

<p class="first">FOLLOWING upon my coming to the house on the
moor, it was some weeks before I settled down into a contented
frame of mind and felt happy in my surroundings. It was not that
my employer and two fellow-servants from the very first did not
do their best to make me comfortable, as it was obvious they
were intending to be most kind to me. The work, too, was light
and I had plenty of spare time to myself; the food was good and
there was a cosy, homely atmosphere in the big kitchen where we
three had our meals. Another thing, I had a nice comfortably
furnished room in the upper story and, the weather being
cold&mdash;it was November when I arrived&mdash;I could have as
big a fire as I wanted in the huge old-fashioned grate.</p>

<p>Yet&mdash;I could not shake off the feeling that an evil
spirit brooded over the place. There was something so gloomy and
sinister in the great loneliness of our surroundings, and it
seemed to suggest to me tragedy of a mysterious and unknown kind.
As I expected from what I had heard at the hotel in Bovey Tracey,
we were miles and miles from anywhere, with no other habitations
in sight, no road near us and, week after week, no human beings
passed by. We might, I thought, be the last people left alive in
all the world, destined to live and die and meet no fellow
creatures again.</p>

<p>The house was situated about halfway down a sort of big saucer
in the moor and surrounded on all sides in the near distance by
the huge grey tors. Though of anything but a nervous disposition,
I used sometimes to sit at my window at night and imagine there
were hundreds of unfriendly eyes watching the house. When the
moon was up I was quite sure I could see dim and ghostly figures
flittering round among the rocks at the foot of the tors.</p>

<p>Amusingly enough, to some extent I had got upon a confidential
footing with my master at once, almost indeed before I had been
in the house a couple of hours. We had hardly finished the midday
meal when he appeared at the door of the kitchen and beckoned me
out.</p>

<p>"I want you to get accustomed to the dogs," he said, "and the
sooner the better, because, seeing so few people, they are
inclined to be unfriendly with strangers. I hope you are not
afraid of dogs."</p>

<p>I told him I certainly was not, though up to then my
acquaintance with dogs had been confined to the patting of the
few mongrel strays that were always hanging about Rocker Street.
He led me into the yard and two magnificent-looking Alsatians
sidled up and eyed me suspiciously. "These are our children, mine
and my servants," he said with his voice dropping to gentle and
affectionate tones, "Jupiter and Juno, the much-loved children of
three old people. We dread the time when one day we shall have to
lose them. No, don't be afraid. They'll be quiet as long as I am
here with them."</p>

<p>But I wasn't in the least bit afraid, and at once started to
pat them. At first they just tolerated my attention, with their
huge, fierce eyes fixed intently upon my face. Then, however,
their tails began to wag ever so slightly which made my master
seem rather surprised. "That's splendid!" he exclaimed. "You've
evidently got a way with animals. Some people have, but it's a
gift born in them and can never be acquired. Yes, they'll soon be
friends with you and, once they are, they'll be faithful unto
death. Now I'll show you another dog, but he won't take to you so
easily. He's of a wild breed and you must never go too near him.
First, I'll chain these two up. They've never got over their
jealousy of Sakao. That's the other dog's name."</p>

<p>He led the way across the yard to a big shed and, opening the
door, I saw it contained a good-sized cage, heavily barred. The
front of the cage faced away from us and looked out on to the
open moor. I sniffed hard and an unpleasant chord of memory
stirred in me. I was back in our horrible little house in Rocker
Street again.</p>

<p>"But you've not got another dog here," I exclaimed. "I can
smell the smell of a wolf."</p>

<p>My master turned on me with a start. "No, no," he said
sharply. "It's an Indian dog. He came from near Tibet."</p>

<p>A dark blackish shape darted out from the shadows at the far
end of the cage and, standing on its hind legs, thrust its muzzle
against the bars, at the same time wagging its tail
violently.</p>

<p>I laughed merrily. "But it <i>is</i> a wolf, sir," I said, "an
Alaskan wolf, and it's only half-grown as yet. It'll be twice
that size one day."</p>

<p>My master's pleasant face turned to one of great sternness.
"What makes you think that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know for certain," I said confidently. "You see, you
see&mdash;" I hesitated for a few moments to gain time, "I had an
uncle once who was a keeper in Max's Menagerie and he had charge
of the wolves there. As a little girl, he used often to take me
behind the cages and show me their cubs. That's how I recognise
this wolf here."</p>

<p>His face was a study. He looked most embarrassed and uneasy,
and, indeed almost angry. Then suddenly his whole expression
altered and his face broke again into its usual pleasant lines.
"Then I see it's going to be no good trying to deceive you," he
said with a smile, "but I didn't want to frighten you. Yes, it is
an Alaskan wolf and only half grown, as you said."</p>

<p>A sudden thought came to my mind. "And did he then get out and
kill those sheep that Sunday morning," I asked, "those belonging
to that farmer at a place called Lustleigh?" and a second later I
could have kicked myself for being such a little fool to say I
knew anything about what I heard had happened.</p>

<p>My master's face had become very stern again and he glared
with angry suspicion at me. Still, he spoke very quietly, "And
how, pray, do you come to know anything about it?" he asked.</p>

<p>Now as can be well understood, up to then I was only a very
ill-educated young girl who had practically had no experience of
the world, but I always take something of a pride in remembering
how, after my so tactless and foolish admission that I was in
possession of a secret he would certainly want no outsider to
know, I yet collected my wits so quickly again and spoke quite as
quietly and casually as he had done.</p>

<p>"Oh, I heard all about it this morning," I replied, "when I
was waiting for you in the hotel," and I told him what the barman
had said, adding quickly, "But you needn't be afraid, sir, that,
if you do not wish it known, I shall never tell anyone you have a
wolf here. I'm not a girl who talks and know when to hold my
tongue. You can quite trust me."</p>

<p>His face had cleared while I was speaking and he smiled quite
nicely again. "Yes, I think I can," he said. He shrugged his
shoulders. "You see this poor beast has become something of a
worry to me. When only a few weeks old he was smuggled here to me
by a sea-captain friend of mine who thought he was giving me a
wonderful present. I didn't want him, but I've gradually grown
quite fond of him. He's a terrible one for getting out of his
cage. That's twice he's done it now and the farmers would murder
me if they knew I'd got him here."</p>

<p>"But how did you get him back after he'd killed those sheep?"
I asked wonderingly.</p>

<p>"He came back by himself and I found him whimpering outside
his cage. The poor beast had become frightened and wanted to get
back to his home."</p>

<p>I took a great liking for my master at once and, in return, he
evinced quite a fatherly interest in me. I always think it might
have been because he had never married and had no children of his
own. So the fact of having someone young about him appealed to
him now in a novel sort of way. Another thing, too. With all his
many interests, his collection of gold coins, his books and his
writing at times he must have been lonely and wanted someone to
talk to. His man, Rahm, was rather deaf and, accordingly,
difficult to carry on a conversation with, and between him and
Mrs. Rahm&mdash;I learnt the two of them had been in his
household for upwards of thirty years&mdash;there was always
something of the barrier of natural awe which I understand every
Indian woman has for her Sahib. At any rate, with all her
strength of character, Mrs. Rahm, I soon perceived, always seemed
shy and meek when in his presence.</p>

<p>So, apart from helping in the housework for which I had been
engaged because of Mrs. Rahm's advancing age and rheumatics, I
speedily became as well something of a companion to my master. I
carried his things for him when he went trout fishing in the
little stream about half a mile from the house and accompanied
him as well when he went out with his gun after plover on the
moor. Of an evening, too, when I had soon become quite an expert
with his typewriter, I typed while he dictated slowly a book he
was writing about his so prized collection of gold coins.</p>

<p>And, oh, as it turned out in time, how fully I was to be
repaid for every service I did for him! The three years I was
associated with him were to make all the difference in the world
to me in my after-life, as when we eventually parted I was
altogether a changed girl from the raw and ignorant one who had
first come to him.</p>

<p>When I had been with him only a few weeks, always of a kind
and in a general way most conscientious disposition, it seemed
suddenly to dawn upon him how unfair it was for him to have
brought a girl of my age into such a lonely place where no chance
would be given her of developing her character. So one day he
told me smilingly that, as my mind was so virginal&mdash;of
course he meant I was so ignorant of everything&mdash;he felt it
his duty to give me some sort of education.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he started to awake my interest in everything
generally. He talked to me of the countries he had been to, of
history, of science, of the religions of the world, of the great
men living and dead, of the great books that had been written, of
art and even music.</p>

<p>His knowledge, as I came to realise later, was encyclopaedic
and he had a way of imparting it that impressed it forcibly upon
my memory. My memory was good and, naturally quick and sharp, he
found me an apt pupil. He accompanied his teaching, too, with a
reference to the hundreds and hundreds of books he had in his
library.</p>

<p>Soon he was making me give a good part of each day to study,
and if he had not stirred my ambitions I should certainly have
regarded him as something of a hard taskmaster. However, I had
become as enthusiastic as he was and never gave him any cause for
complaint. I thought him one of the kindest and best of men and a
real affection sprang up between us. I was not the only one
either who thought the world of him.</p>

<p>His two Hindu servants idolised him, and everything he did, in
their eyes, was right. Watching him like a faithful dog, his man,
Rahm was always alert to do him any service he could.</p>

<p>Rahm and his wife were unlike any Hindus I had ever read
about, as they both ate anything, and Rahm himself smoked quite a
lot. Also whenever my master went into Bovey he always brought
back a bottle of beer for him. I never had much to do with Rahm,
as he was a quiet and reserved man who spoke very little. While
<i>he</i> seemed to me to have little religion at all, his wife
appeared to have lots of different kinds. Indeed, my master told
me laughingly once that, though her people in India were of the
Brahman or priestly class, she generally picked up something of a
new religion wherever she went.</p>

<p>From the very first I was most interested in her, as she was a
very unusual woman and so very clever and capable in so many
ways. Of medium height, she was stout, with a big heavy face and
huge dark eyes. She cooked beautifully and was one of the best
dress-makers I have ever known. Of an evening when all the work
was done, she would appear in a beautiful silk gown, and wearing
big earrings and big bracelets of solid gold. She had beautiful
brooches and rings of sparkling stones, too, and would bind her
head round in a rich-looking scarf of most lovely colours. When
later I had got to know her quite well I told her laughingly that
she looked like a picture I had once seen of the favourite wife
of an enormously wealthy Rajah. She was very pleased with what I
said and gave me a stately bow. She could speak English
perfectly.</p>

<p>About her religion, and I never could get out of her exactly
what it was, but it was certainly of a funny kind. While she
never admitted saying any prayers, at night she would burn
incense sticks in her bedroom before several beautifully-carved
little ivory statues she had upon a shelf there. One, in
particular, always intrigued me. It was that of a squatting bull
richly caparisoned, and she told me it was an exact reproduction
of the Giant Bull of Siva in the city of Mysore. She had another
one, the head of a fearsome-looking hideous snake with big amber
eyes, and she said he was 'Siva the Destroyer' himself.</p>

<p>I asked her once if she believed in God and she replied, very
solemnly, "Yes, and in more than one, in many." She went on to
tell me she was a student of the Occult, "That which we don't
see," she said, dropping her voice into a low whisper, "that dark
world which lies all around us, but where the spirits move only
in the mystery of the night." Her arm shot out towards the window
looking out on to the moor. "At nights when the moon is full
spirit men and women move along those tors, and if it is warm and
not too bad for my rheumatism I go out and walk among them."</p>

<p>"But don't they ever harm you?" I asked, pretending to be very
astonished.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "They would do if they dared, but they
know I am myself of the spirit world with them, and accordingly
protected. So, while they might do dreadful things to you if you
went among them, they leave me alone."</p>

<p>Of course, while it certainly gave me a deliciously creepy
feeling listening to her, I didn't believe a word she said. Still
I asked curiously, "But how is it you are like this, so different
from other people?"</p>

<p>She became very serious. "By long years of meditation. I am
well over sixty now, and for more than forty years I have been
training myself." She held up one fat and bejewelled hand
warningly. "Do you know that when I look in one of those crystals
I have shown to you I can see into the future as well as the
past? I could see into some of yours if I tried, but the Sahib
has forbidden me to do anything to you, and I bow to him as I
would to any gods." She laughed softly. "Why, I could throw you
into a sleep if he would let me and strip you bare of all your
secrets. Oh, yes, girl, you have secrets, though they are not bad
ones. Still, you have not told the Sahib all the truth. I had a
spirit dream about you the other night and a rough-looking man
asked me about you, but I would not tell him, and he went away.
He will never trouble you any more."</p>

<p>Remembering what I had heard the barman say about her powers,
I felt really uneasy now and was glad to think she was so
friendly with me. After all, I told myself, it was impossible for
anyone to read the future, though for all that I resolved to get
my master's permission one day and let her tell me what she could
of all that was going to happen to me.</p>

<p>Now, while undoubtedly this Indian woman talked a lot I
considered rubbish about things I could not understand, of things
I could grasp, as I have said, I found her a very clever
woman.</p>

<p>One day she had a bad headache, with so much pain that she
said she could hardly see. She suggested I should massage her
head and neck for her and explained to me how I should do it.
"But you must concentrate," she said sternly, "and be confident
you are going to do me good." I did as she directed and almost at
once she declared her pain was passing. "You have the gift of
healing, my child," she exclaimed excitedly. "It is stronger in
you than in me. You have the power of giving something of your
youth and strength to others."</p>

<p>After that she gave me many lessons in massage, not, as she
said, the mere kneading of the muscles, but acting also upon the
nerves and transmitting curative properties all over the body. At
any rate, when later my master had a bad attack of neuritis in
one of his shoulders it was found I could take away the pain
almost at once, and he was very grateful to me. "So, there's some
good after all in that old lady," he laughed. "I told you she was
a remarkable woman."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rahm was very proud of what she had discovered in me and,
sending down to Plymouth for some of the best quality tweed, made
me a costume which I was to learn afterwards was as beautifully
cut as if it had come from the workshop of a designer in
Mayfair.</p>

<p>And now I come to the beginning of a happening which years
later was to occasion me much anxiety before its reverberations
were silenced and died down for ever, Thank Heaven, now some time
ago!</p>

<p>It started upon a horrible wet evening in the March after I
had arrived at the Grey House. The morning had been fairly fine,
but towards noon the mists began to roll over the moor and a
drizzling rain set in. So far from clearing in the afternoon as
it often did, the rain became worse and, with darkness setting in
it was raining heavily. It was bitterly cold, too, and there was
all the promise of a dreadful night.</p>

<p>I was in the big living-room, laying the table for my master's
evening meal, while he was reading in an armchair before the
bright fire. The two Alsatians were sleeping on a big rug beside
him.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the dogs stirred uneasily and, sitting up, began to
growl ominously. My master turned to me with a frown. "They heard
something, Polly," he said and, as he spoke, the growls turned to
snappy barks and then, even as we stood listening, there came a
loud knocking upon the front door.</p>

<p>My heart began to beat painfully. All the months I had been
upon the moor no one had ever come to the house after the night
had fallen and, with the windows and doors heavily barred and the
two big dogs to protect us, I had always felt so secure from any
harm or danger. Now, however, the coming of someone, upon such a
dreadful night, too, when the rain was lashing against the
windows sent a chilling fear into me and I could feel my legs
shaking under me. From the expression upon my master's face I
could see he was not wholly undisturbed, either, and that made me
feel even worse.</p>

<p>I always remembered that barman at the hotel having said the
Colonel was afraid of nobody and nothing, but I had long since
came to realise that the man was mistaken there. Fearless of
everything in the ordinary way, I had learnt my master had yet
one great anxiety and that was his collection of gold coins. They
were more than three hundred of them and, very valuable, they
would have tempted any thief to get hold of them. I know I had
made his anxiety worse, too, by so tactlessly telling him, as I
had done, that his possession of them had been discussed openly
that morning over the bar in the Bovey Tracey hotel.</p>

<p>Now he sprang quickly to his feet. "Tell Rahm," he ordered me
sharply, "to light the lantern and bring it to me upstairs. I am
going to open the window over the front door and see who is
knocking."</p>

<p>Obeying his orders and seeing Rahm run up with the lantern, I
stood trembling at the bottom of the stairs to listen to what was
going on.</p>

<p>I heard the window opened and my master call out, "Who are
you, and what is it you want?"</p>

<p>"I've lost my way," called back a man's voice. "How far is it
to Princetown, please?"</p>

<p>"Ten miles," was the reply, "but you'll never get there on a
night like this. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"A holiday-maker from London. I've walked from Okehampton
today."</p>

<p>"Extremely foolish," snapped my master. "You ought to have had
more sense."</p>

<p>"Well, if I can't get to Princetown as you seem to think,"
said the man outside, "could you let me sleep in a stable or some
barn tonight. I've got some sandwiches with me, and shan't
trouble you for any food. I'm a returned soldier and accustomed
to roughing it."</p>

<p>Now I knew my master to be very kind-hearted and would not
allow that with all his disinclination to let a stranger come
into the house. So, I was not at all surprised when I heard him
say, "No, I'll have to let you come in," and then he added
sharply. "But, first, are you carrying any firearms? You're not?
Still, you'll have to let us search you to make sure. We are old
people here and can't afford to take any risks. Wait where you
are, and I'll come down and open the door."</p>

<p>A minute or two later the front door was opened, to bring
within the rays of a lantern a young fellow, looking drenched
from top to toe. With one hand my master held up the lantern and
with the other restrained the snarling dogs whom he was holding
by their leashes.</p>

<p>"Stand quite still," ordered my master, "or I shan't be able
to keep in these dogs. Hold your hands above your head and my man
will search you. I'm sorry, but we must be quite sure."</p>

<p>The stranger submitted smilingly to the search and then,
unbuckling his knapsack from his shoulders, exposed the contents.
No weapon being found there, my master led him into the house and
ushered him into the big room where the fire was burning. "Now
we'd better introduce ourselves," I heard him say. "I am Colonel
Jasper, late of the Indian Army."</p>

<p>"And I'm Baxter Smith," returned the other, "at one time
Lieutenant in the Second Kents and now an officer in the London
branch of the Consolidated Bank." He held himself every erect and
spoke in educated tones. "I am sure it is most kind of you to
take me in. I am most grateful to you."</p>

<p>My master, repressing the annoyance he must have felt, at once
became the courteous host. "My man is getting a room ready for
you," he said graciously, "and, directly the fire is burning, you
shall go upstairs and get rid of your wet things. I'm afraid an
old dressing-gown is the best I can do for you while they are
drying." Then, noticing his guest was looking at the growling
dogs, he went on. "You needn't worry about them as long as I'm
here, though they're always inclined to be unfriendly with
strangers."</p>

<p>In the meantime I was going on laying the table, now, however,
arranging for two. Covertly having a good look at the
guest-to-be, I felt almost ashamed with myself for having been
such a little fool and so frightened at his knocking upon the
door. He appeared to be just what he said he was, an innocent
holiday-maker who had lost his way, and one could not help
feeling sorry for his drenched condition. Obviously, he was
soaked to the skin.</p>

<p>Still, for all my sympathy there, I was not too much taken
with his appearance. Certainly, he was not bad-looking, but I
thought the expression of his face was an overbold and insolent
one, and it was not made any better by his hard and glittering
eyes. I judged him to be about seven or eight and twenty.</p>

<p>For the meal which followed, with his wet clothes taken away
by Rahm to dry, he came to the table in the promised
dressing-gown and pyjamas. I waited upon them, and it was a very
nice meal, grilled trout, a cold duck and Stilton cheese. He
stared at me quite a lot, almost, I thought disgustedly, as if he
were trying to catch my eye. He was most respectful, however, to
his host.</p>

<p>"But how is it?" asked my master, "if you were travelling from
Okehampton to Princetown by compass as you say, that you were so
much out in your reckoning, quite ten miles in a comparatively
speaking short journey?"</p>

<p>The young fellow shrugged his shoulders. "Well, I had to keep
on avoiding what I thought were bogs and I expect that put me out
a bit. You see that damned mist closed down upon me about noon
and I could see absolutely nothing after that until a narrow
streak of it lifted for about two minutes about half an hour
before I knocked on your door. Then I found I was almost banging
into that big tor you've got close near here."</p>

<p>"I don't understand," said my master, looking very puzzled.
"You mean to tell me you've been walking blind over the moor
since midday to-day."</p>

<p>"Except for my compass. I was holding it in my hand almost all
the time."</p>

<p>"And the first thing you saw was this big tor near the
house?"</p>

<p>The other nodded. "Yes! Another five yards and I should have
walked head-on into it. But that lift in the clouds came just in
time and I saw the light of this house, too. I was so done up by
then that, though the rain had started to come down in torrents,
after taking the bearings of your lights, I had to sit down for a
bit of a breather." He laughed. "I think I was lucky to see the
lights here."</p>

<p>"Lucky!" exclaimed my master. "I should just think you were.
Why, that's Black Tor you nearly ran into and it's surrounded on
three sides by Fowler's Bog, the deepest and most dangerous bog
on the whole moor. Two men are known for certain to have lost
their lives there and, coming the way you must have done, you
were walking within a few feet of it for two or three hundred
yards. Why, it's dangerous for anyone who doesn't know every inch
of the ground to walk there even in broad daylight."</p>

<p>At that moment the conversation was interrupted by Rahm coming
into speak to Master and a short conversation followed. They
spoke quickly in Hindustani and there was no particular
expression upon their faces. Of course, at the time I didn't
understand a word of what they said, but later that evening I
learnt what the talk had been about.</p>

<p>"This man, Sahib," had said Rahm, "is a liar. He had had a
pistol on him somewhere, most likely in one of his boots. He hid
it in the bed before he handed out his wet clothes for me to dry.
I saw the sheet had been disturbed and looked to see why. The
pistol is fully loaded. Should I take the cartridges out and put
the pistol back."</p>

<p>My master had replied quite quietly, "Ah, now we know where we
are! No, don't touch the cartridges, or, directly he handles the
pistol, he'll know they are gone. Get that piece of carborundum
out of my drawer and file away the nipple on the trigger of the
pistol. Be sure you file away enough, so that it won't strike the
cartridges, and then put the pistol back. We'll lock him in his
room tonight." Then, as Rahm had been leaving the room, he had
turned apologetically to his guest. "I am sorry I can't give you
coffee from freshly-ground berries, as my man tells me our little
grinder has gone wrong. So, it's only coffee essence I can offer
you," and he resumed the conversation where it had been
interrupted.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock to the minute my master rose to his feet. "I
don't want to appear inhospitable," he said, "but we always
retire at the same time here and so, if you don't mind, I'll get
you to go up to your room now." He laughed. "We shall be locking
you in, too, for as I told you we old people cannot afford to
take any risks. Besides, if you happened to walk in your sleep
during the night it might turn out to be very dangerous for you,
as the dogs run loose in the house after dark and, as I've told
you, they're savage with strangers."</p>

<p>The next morning the lieutenant's door was unlocked very early
and my master, accompanied by Rahm with the dried clothes, came
into the room.</p>

<p>"Your good fortune is still holding," he said briskly, "for
the rain has cleared off and it's going to be a fine day. When
you are dressed you can find your way down yourself, as my little
dogs are now out in the yard. Breakfast will be ready in twenty
minutes."</p>

<p>However, our guest was quicker even than that, as when I was
carrying some breakfast things into the big living-room to my
great annoyance I found him already there by himself. He was
holding a book of Shakespeare's Plays in his hand, and I guessed
he must have taken it haphazardly out of the bookshelf. As it
happened, it was one my master had recently given me for my
lessons in English literature and he had written my name on the
fly-leaf.</p>

<p>The young fellow looked up when I came into the room and
greeted me unpleasantly. "Hullo, Polly," he exclaimed in cheeky
and familiar tones. "So, the Polly of last night is Miss Polly
Wiggs, is she?" He grinned. "Well, the surname's not half nice
enough for such an elegant young lady as you are, and I think it
a great shame, too, your wasting all your prettiness up here, so
far away from the boys who'd like to make a fuss of you."</p>

<p>I felt myself colouring up hotly at his impudence. I had heard
all about the pistol from Mrs. Rahm and was detesting him for the
lies he had told my master. So it was something of an annoyance
to me now that he had come to learn my name. Certainly, it seemed
only a small thing then, but, had I only known it, his chance
finding it out was to cast a dark shadow over my life in later
years and, at any rate for a time, fill me with the chilling fear
of dreadful consequences.</p>

<p>He was saved from the sharp retort I was about to make by the
appearance of my master, and the two sat down to the meal.
Directly it was over, my master lost no time in speeding him upon
his journey. Having bidden him goodbye, he returned into the room
where I was now clearing away the breakfast things.</p>

<p>"A bad character that young man," he remarked impressively to
me, "and I am wondering now if it were a trick his arriving here
last night in the pouring rain. It seemed to me that, during our
little dinner when he wasn't watching you, he was looking very
hard at my coin-cabinet, as if he had been expecting to find some
such piece of furniture here." He smiled. "Yes, and he had the
impudence to ask from where you came, saying you looked a London
girl. When I didn't tell him immediately&mdash;I had no intention
of doing it at all&mdash;he went on he was sure you were not one
from Devonshire, as in that case you wouldn't have come to live
up here."</p>

<p>"How did he make that out?" I asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Because Devon people, he said, believed this part of the moor
was haunted and he told me a ridiculous story about someone he'd
met a little while ago, whose grandfather had been attacked one
night on the moor road not far from Bovey Tracey by an evil
spirit in the form of a man with long hair, and he'd only managed
to escape by leaving him to drink the blood of his pony. I told
the young man I was astonished at his being so credulous."</p>

<p>A sudden chord of memory had stirred in me as my master was
speaking, and then all suddenly I recollected what it was. "Oh,
Colonel Jasper," I exclaimed, "then I've seen this man before and
know who he is. I'm sure of it now. Several times last night his
face puzzled me and I was wondering of whom he was reminding me.
Now I know."</p>

<p>"Then who is he?" asked my master sharply, because I had
stopped breathlessly.</p>

<p>"He's one of those two men," I said, "whom that barman at the
Bovey Hotel, as I told you the first day I came up here, had been
telling about Sakao killing those sheep. He must be, because
afterwards I heard the barman tell him that same story you've
just been telling me about the evil spirit drinking a pony's
blood. The barman said it was to <i>his</i> grandfather it had
all happened."</p>

<p>Another thought struck me and I felt my voice shaking in my
dismay. "Oh, and it was to him the barman went on to tell a lot
about you and how you had a valuable collection of gold coins.
Worse than that, too, though the young fellow told the barman he
was a journalist on a newspaper, I heard the man who came into
the bar directly after he had left say he recognised him as a
street-bookmaker from Whitechapel called Tod Bellamy who had a
very bad reputation as he had been put in prison once for
breaking in and stealing from someone's house."</p>

<p>My master looked troubled. "Then it seems almost certain," he
said, "that he <i>did</i> come here to spy things out, and no
wonder he seemed so interested in my cabinet." His face
brightened and he spoke quite cheerfully, probably, I thought, to
comfort me. "But at any rate, we needn't worry. It he <i>does</i>
come we'll always be ready for him and, with the dogs here, we'll
always know in plenty of time when there are any strangers
about."</p>

<p>For many days afterwards, however, I was feeling intensely
nervous and, at night, for hour after hour would lie awake
listening for the dogs to start barking. My nervousness, too, was
not made any better when Mrs. Rahm whispered darkly that she had
been looking into her crystal and had seen blood in it, streams
of blood, she said, and it meant evil was boding for someone. In
her dreams, too, she said she had seen the black-winged angel of
death flying round the tors, and she was sure it would not be
very long before he would swoop down and bring death to
someone.</p>

<p>Of course. I knew it was all nonsense, but for all that it
frightened me. Still, weeks going by without anything happening,
I at length lost all my fears and could sleep soundly once again.
Then, all suddenly, like the bursting of a bomb, something worse
than anyone could ever have imagined actually <i>did</i> happen
and we were plunged headlong into terrible tragedy.</p>

<p>It was upon a Sunday morning and about half an hour after the
dogs had been let out of the house, that Rahm came rushing into
his master in a great state of consternation to say the dogs had
been poisoned. Jupiter was not so very bad, for he was vomiting
fiercely and getting rid of much of the poison, but Juno was in a
pitiable state. Lying upon the ground, with her eyes almost
bursting from her head, her outstretched body was arched horribly
and jerking in convulsive spasms of agony. She was covered in
sweat, as if she had been lathered with a shaving brush.</p>

<p>My master went white as death but, all prepared for such an
emergency, lost not a second in trying to save the poor animal.
She was given copious draughts of salt water to make her sick,
the veins inside her ears were cut and cut until she was bleeding
like a stuck pig and, when the spasms seized her, the two men
held her down with all their strength to keep these spasms from
tearing her to pieces, while to me was given the task of holding
a chloroform-soaked sponge a few inches from her mouth and
nostrils to render her as deeply unconscious as possible.</p>

<p>At first, with the awful spasms following so quickly upon one
another, it seemed impossible she could be saved, but gradually
they came less frequent and their strength weakened. Finally,
they passed off altogether and we could see her agony was ended
and that she was going to live. She lay limp and exhausted, but
she was saved. Dosed with brandy and wrapped in a blanket, she
was carried into the house and laid before the kitchen fire.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Jupiter was much better. He had had no very
bad spasms, but, limp and sweating profusely, he looked a
dreadfully sick animal. Given brandy, too, he was also blanketted
and laid before the fire alongside of his mate.</p>

<p>It was not difficult to be quite certain how the poison, which
my master said had been strychnine, had been picked up by the
dogs, as Rahm found the remains of two pigeons lying in the yard.
He brought them to his master who, after one quick glance at
them, without a word disappeared into the house and I heard him
going up the stairs to the upper story. In all my life, never
before nor since have I seen such cold fury upon anyone's face. I
knew he must have been sharing every spasm of the agony of his
so-loved Alsatians, and I thought he looked like a madman
controlling himself only with great difficulty.</p>

<p>A very few minutes later he came quickly into the kitchen
where Rahm, his wife and I were looking after the dogs, and
issued a sharp peremptory order in Hindustani to Rahm who nodded
understandingly and at once left the room. Then he turned to me.
"You stay where you are, Polly," he said curtly. "Through the
telescope I've seen two men hiding behind those rocks under Black
Tor and I am going out to deal with them."</p>

<p>But with his following after Rahm, I felt I must see what was
going on and, disregarding Mrs. Rahm's insistence I should obey
her master's order, ran up to the roof to look through the
telescope myself. It was housed in a glass-walled dome-like
structure, half sunk in the roof itself which was flat at that
end of the house. Even at a short distance away the dome was not
very conspicuous, though it allowed the telescope to be swung
round in every direction upon its tripod. As my master had left
it, the telescope was now pointing direct on to Black Tor and
took in very clearly the line of rocks at its foot he had
referred to. They were about breast high and I stared hard and
breathlessly at them. However I could pick out no movement of
anyone behind them.</p>

<p>My attention, however, was soon drawn to much nearer the
house, and there was no longer any need for me to look through
the telescope. In one direction I saw Rahm striding along with a
rifle upon his shoulder. In another, also with a rifle upon his
shoulder, my master was walking quickly and, to my horror, I saw
he had got Sakao with him. The wolf was wearing his big collar
and straining hard at the attached chain.</p>

<p>It was no wonder I felt scared, for I knew that if Sakao were
loosed he would savage anyone, and I was fearful that in the mood
my master then was, with the thought of the agony his loved
Alsatians had gone through so upper most in his mind, there was
no knowing to what length of punishment he would go.</p>

<p>I very soon took in what it was intended should happen. With
my master going one way and Rahm the other, whoever were hiding
behind that line of rocks would soon in one direction or the
other be exposed to the fire of their rifles. Even if the hidden
men were armed with pistols, they would be helpless against
rifles, as they could be picked off long before their attackers
came within pistol range.</p>

<p>What was flashing through my mind must have come too to the
two hiding men. At any rate I knew suddenly that Rahm must have
seen something, as, dropping upon one knee, he uplifted his rifle
and I heard two reports in quick succession. Obviously, however,
he hadn't succeeded in hitting either of them, as the next moment
two figures darted from behind the rocks and began racing
away.</p>

<p>Then what happened is almost too horrible to describe, and for
years afterwards the memory of it haunted me. Sakao, the wolf,
had broken away and was going after them like a streak of
lightning, with his long dark body stretching close to the
ground. I turned quickly to the telescope again and just caught
him as the hindermost of the two men whipped round to deal with
him. The telescope brought them close to me as if they were only
a few feet away and I could see so plainly the man's ghastly face
and terror-stricken eyes. His right arm shot out and I could
glimpse the pistol in his hand, but however quickly he fired he
must have missed the wolf and, in a matter of seconds, the big
animal had got him by the throat and was shaking him from side to
side in a way horrible to see.</p>

<p>Then everything which followed seemed to happen like
lightning. The man who had been running in front stopped and ran
back to help his companion whom Sakao had now pinned to the
ground and was continuing to worry like a terrier with a rat. I
heard the faint sounds of several pistol shots and, as the wolf
instantly crumpled up, was sure he must have received a mortal
wound. Then for perhaps two seconds the man who had shot him bent
once over his friend, before turning round again and racing off
at his utmost speed to disappear over a rise in the ground.</p>

<p>I saw my master arrive upon the scene of the ghastly struggle
of which I had been such a fascinated but trembling spectator.
From his attitude as he stood over the two bodies it was evident
both the man and the wolf were dead. Rahm ran up quickly and a
short conversation ensued. Then Rahm came back to the house and,
going into one of the sheds reappeared quickly carrying a
tarpaulin with him. I saw the two bodies, those of the wolf and
the man, laid upon the tarpaulin and then it was dragged out of
sight to behind Black Tor. I guessed what was probably going to
be done. The bodies were to be thrown into Fowler's Bog.</p>

<p>Nearly an hour passed before my master, accompanied by Rahm
came back to the house, and I went in to the big room at once to
speak to him. He looked very strained and white and was mixing
himself a brandy and soda.</p>

<p>"A bad business this, Polly," he said. "Sakao killed one of
those men and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I saw it all through the telescope," I interrupted, "and
you've thrown the bodies in Fowler's Bog, haven't you?"</p>

<p>My master nodded miserably. "Yes, and I realise already that I
have been much too hasty. It was very foolish as when the police
come I shan't be able to deny what's happened. The other wretch
will point out to them where his companion was killed and&mdash;"
he shrugged his shoulders "&mdash;I don't know what will happen
to me."</p>

<p>"Nothing will happen to you," I said sharply, "for the police
won't be coming here and they'll never learn anything about it.
When the man who escaped ran back to shoot Sakao I saw his face
quite plainly. He was the man who came here that night for
shelter from the rain, the man called Tod Bellamy, a Whitechapel
bookmaker. I recognised him without the shadow of a doubt. Then,
remember I heard them say at the hotel that he's been put in
prison for house-breaking. So, he'll not dare to go to the
police. How would he account for his being up here hiding among
those rocks, and, another thing, to explain that he had shot
Sakao he'd have to admit he was carrying a pistol. That would
make things look very black for him as a one-time convict."</p>

<p>My master certainly appeared relieved at what I said, but for
all that he spoke hesitatingly. "But he'll want his revenge," he
said. "Of the bold character we know him to be, he's not the type
of man to sit down tamely under all that's happened."</p>

<p>"But he'll have to," I insisted. "He's clever enough to
realise he can't hurt you without hurting himself as well. No,
I'm sure we shall not have any police coming up here. We shall
hear nothing more about it."</p>

<p>And I proved to be quite right. Certainly we were all very
worried at first, but with the days and weeks and even months
passing and nothing happening, our fears gradually died down and
in time we became quite certain we were safe.</p>

<p>Two years and longer passed by. My education had long since
become a real obsession with my master, a greater one even than
his collection of gold coins. He was tireless in instructing me
and, awakening in me, as I have said, a lively ambition to become
a really educated woman, I worked my hardest to do him
credit.</p>

<p>"You're a clever girl, Polly," he said one day to me, "and,
from what you tell me, you can only be getting most of your
cleverness from your mother."</p>

<p>As can be well understood I had told him little of the truth
about my parentage, fibbing that my mother had been a
schoolteacher and my father a verger in a church. He was not at
all curious about my parents and never doubted I was speaking the
truth. Associated so much with him, he at length decided I should
take my meals at his table. "And you're not to call me Master any
more," he smiled. "I no longer look upon you as my servant. We
are friends and companions and I am treating you almost as my
adopted daughter. So, it's Colonel Jasper you are to call me
now&mdash;" he regarded me affectionately "&mdash;and perhaps one
day it may even be 'Father.'"</p>

<p>The Rahms were not at all jealous and, as the changes were the
wishes of their so dearly-loved sahib, they accepted them as a
matter of course.</p>

<p>"But you're not a girl who will spoil," Mrs. Rahm said to me
once, "as you're much too sensible for that." She smiled
knowingly. "Still, as I've told you before, I know you are
something of a little story-teller and I certainly don't believe
all you've told us about yourself. The other night I looked into
one of my crystals and learn't quite a lot about you. Your ship
will have to go through some great storms, but it will live
through them and one day come safe into harbour." She nodded.
"And it was quite a big ship I saw, with nothing small or shabby
about it."</p>

<p>"Then when it comes in," I laughed, "you shall have one of its
best cabins and I'll take you and Mr. Rahm for a lovely
voyage."</p>

<p>She shook her head sadly. "But we shan't be here then, Polly
dear," she sighed. "When I whisper to my crystal about myself, it
always refuses to tell me anything. It goes very dark then and I
see nothing but black and heavy clouds." She smiled brightly.
"Still, I don't worry about it, as whatever Fate has ordained
will happen to us, and we can only bow to her decisions and
accept them uncomplainingly."</p>

<p>I had been at the house upon the moor for getting on for three
years when a letter came from my master's sister in India, saying
she was coming home for a few months stay and would arrive only a
short time after her letter. I was most interested as I had heard
quite a lot about her both from my master and Mrs. Rahm.</p>

<p>A Mrs. Arundel, and four and twenty years younger than my
master, her husband was an important official in the Indian Civil
Service. A highly-educated woman and a graduate of Cambridge
University, she was something of a star in Indian social circles.
So, as can be well understood I was not a little nervous as to
exactly what she would think of me and the position I now held in
her brother's household.</p>

<p>However, directly she arrived I realised that any fears I had
been entertaining were quite groundless, as I found her a
charming and broad-minded woman. She smiled when my master told
her proudly of the education he had given me, but when she came
to try me out&mdash;which she did very thoroughly&mdash;she
became quite as enthusiastic as he was.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't like to say, with a little coaching, Polly," she
said, "what examinations you could not pass. At any rate you
certainly seem to have a wider general knowledge than I had at
your age. Now what are you going to be when you leave my
brother?"</p>

<p>My master answered for me. "I'm going to find her a place that
will lead to something good," he said. "What she needs most now
is a knowledge of the world. I have given her a good foundation
and she must go to people of a good class who will help her
on."</p>

<p>Mrs. Arundel looked amused. "But I don't think it will matter
much what career you map out for her, James," she said, "as I'm
quite sure she won't continue in it for long." She nodded
smilingly to me. "You'll get married, won't you, Polly? With a
face like yours, dear, to be someone's sweetheart is what you
were made for."</p>

<p>She certainly made things much more lively for us from the
first minute she entered the house. She was full of jokes and
humour and poked a lot of good-natured fun at Mrs. Rahm for her
crystal-gazing and belief in the Occult World.</p>

<p>"You take me out with you one night," she laughed, "and we'll
meet some of these spirit friends of yours among the tors. I'm
sure I could interest them as India is supposed to be cram-full
of spirits like them," but Mrs. Rahm looked very serious and said
it was never wise to joke about such matters.</p>

<p>However, if I greatly enjoyed Mrs. Arundel's company and the
breath of new life she had undoubtedly brought into The Grey
House, I was nevertheless soon to realise she was about to bring
another crisis into my life, as after a lot of argument, she
persuaded my master to give up living upon the moor and return to
India with her, at any rate for a time.</p>

<p>She insisted Dartmoor was no place for old people, for
directly she had seen them she said she had been shocked how they
had all aged. The cold moorland air was too strong for them and
they would certainly contract fatal illnesses if they didn't get
away from it. My master at first resisted strongly, but
ultimately gave in and it was arranged they should all return to
India with her the following April.</p>

<p>My master wanted to take me with them but I was not too keen
upon it and Mrs. Arundel thought, too, that it would not be in my
best interests. "If you do come with us, Polly," she said, "you
won't profit as much from all my brother has taught you as if you
stay on in England. Now I have some old friends,
French-Canadians, who are staying in Plymouth and I'll go and
find out if they'd like to have you as a companion for their
daughter Madeline. They are very nice people and I'm sure you
would be happy with them."</p>

<p>She was gone for three days and returned triumphant. "They'll
be delighted, Polly," she said, "and you're to be taken as one of
the family. As I've told you, there are only three of them, this
Mr. Charles de Touraine, his mother, a very old lady, and his
daughter, Madeline, a pretty young girl and, funnily enough,
something very much like you."</p>

<p>Taking me aside, she whispered, "I had to tell them a fib or
two about your parents, as the old lady is a bit snobby and very
proud of their descent from one of the French kings of Navarre.
So, I told them your mother had been at Girton College with me
when I was an undergraduate at Cambridge, and I said your father
had been a clergyman. After all, as your dad was a verger, he was
something to do with a church, wasn't he?" She looked amused.
"Quite excusable fibs and it doesn't do anyone any harm. You
speak nicely and you'll look the part anyhow, and I think it
rather a joke."</p>

<p>Things happened very quickly then and less than a month later
I said goodbye to them all. My master was obviously very upset
and gave me &pound;50 as a parting present. Mrs. Rahm was in
tears and, greatly to my surprise, gave me two of her belongings,
both of which I knew she prized greatly, one of her mysterious
crystals and a gold bangle with peculiar markings upon it. She
said the bangle was given her by a monk in one of the Lamaseries
in Tibet and the markings meant she had been accepted into the
Outer Circle of workers in the World of the Occult.</p>

<p>I left them only a few days before they were due to sail from
Tilbury and went straight to my new place in Plymouth. Then, to
my intense horror and unutterable grief, I read in the newspapers
the following week that the boat they were on had foundered in
the Bay of Biscay, with everyone on board being lost. It was
surmised the boat had struck a floating mine, an aftermath of the
Great War.</p>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.<br>

THE RIVER OF LIFE.</h2>

<p class="first">I FOUND my new family very much what Mrs.
Arundel had said they would be, except that the old lady was
rather eccentric and inclined to be very outspoken in her
remarks. She told me at once she did not like my surname and
that to outsiders I should always be referred to as Miss Polly
and not Miss Wiggs. She told me, however, that she approved of
my appearance which, she smiled, was a good thing as she could
never bear to have people who looked plain or common about her.
At seventy-five, she said I must excuse any little irritability
she might show as she had a bad heart and it often troubled
her.</p>

<p>Her son, Mr. Charles de Touraine was a handsome
aristocratic-looking man with a Vandyke beard, and reminded me
very much of the pictures I had seen of Charles the Second. An
artist by profession, or rather I should say to occupy his time
as he was well-off enough not to care whether he sold his
paintings or not, he was a good-natured, easy-going man who never
seemed to mind much what anyone else did. As with his mother, he
suffered from a bad heart, in his case brought on by rheumatic
fever in his youth.</p>

<p>The daughter, Madeline, or to give her her full name Madeline
Marie Louise de Touraine, I liked the first moment I saw her. My
own age within a few days, she was certainly not unlike me, with
eyes, colouring and shape of face very similar. Also, our height
and figures were much the same. She was a bright vivacious girl,
full of the joy of life, but of a much shrewder nature that would
appear upon the surface. In fact I saw at once I must be most
careful not to make any slip lest she would learn how I had
deceived Colonel Jasper in the matter of my parentage and
upbringing.</p>

<p>In passing, I may say my conscience had never troubled me
there. I took the view, and indeed have taken it all my life,
that my secrets are my own property, and deception is quite
permissible unless it be practised for a wrong and disgraceful
purpose. After all there <i>are</i> different kinds of untruths
and, upon occasions, the blurting out of a truth may be both
unwise and cowardly&mdash;unwise because it may cause pain to
others and be of no benefit to anyone, and cowardly because the
utterer of the untruth has not the courage to take the risk of
keeping silent and being found out. I did not forget the very
mild deception Colonel Jasper and his sister had practised upon
the de Touraine family by making out I had come to The Grey House
in the first instance to be trained for the position of
secretary. Nothing had been told them of my being an ordinary
maid.</p>

<p>How justified I had been in my estimation of this shrewdness
of Madeline de Touraine came home to me long after, when I read
what she had written about me in the diary which she so
scrupulously kept and was so careful always to lock away in her
leather despatch case. I remembered it ran something like this.
"Polly Wiggs has now been with us a month and we all like her
very much. She is a pretty girl of a stately and dignified
appearance. She has far more book-learning that I have, but in
many ways she is as innocent as a little child. It is easy to see
that all she knows of the world she has learnt from books. She is
much more reserved than I and I think no one will ever quite get
to the bottom of her character.</p>

<p>"She is certainly a perfect little lady, but sometimes I fancy
she hasn't yet quite succeeded in ironing out some trace of
commonness one of her parents must have had. Of course, that may
be all imagination on my part, but it seems to me that she is
always upon her guard to make sure she shouldn't trip. Still, her
disposition is a very kind one and I feel I could always trust
her in everything. Really, I think if I told her I had committed
a murder she'd keep it secret as a matter of course. She is very
unconventional in her ideas and it would take a lot to shock
her."</p>

<p>So that's what Madeline thought of me and in one way at any
rate she wasn't far wrong. I <i>was</i> always upon my guard and,
as I say, I kept off the subject of my parents as much as
possible. Still, we got on very well together, and she was most
interested in what I told her about Mrs. Rahm and her
Theosophical views. We got out some Theosophical books from a
library and spent a lot of time reading it up. Mr. de Touraine
was interested, too, being of the opinion there was undoubtedly
'something in it.'</p>

<p>The crystal which Mrs. Rahm had given me was a great source of
interest as well, and we three spent many an evening gazing into
it, sometimes imagining we could really see things there. Once
Mr. de Touraine made us girls shudder by declaring positively
that he could see a large ship going down in a storm and that it
must be the one on which all my former friends had all been
drowned.</p>

<p>For another amusement, Madeline started teaching me French.
She spoke it as well as she did English and, with her putting all
her energy into the lessons, I found her every bit as hard a
taskmaster as Colonel Jasper has been. However, I soon became
very interested, too, and, a good mimic, started right-away with
a good appreciation of the correct accent.</p>

<p>These lessons soon turned out to have been a splendid thing
for me, as Mr. de Touraine suddenly took it into his head that he
would go to stay in Paris to be under a great heart specialist
there. Accordingly, barely six months after I had come to them in
Plymouth, we were all established in a furnished apartment in
Boulogne-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris, with Mr. de Touraine
setting up a studio there as if he were intending his stay should
be a long one.</p>

<p>There followed for Madeline and me a very happy time, for
surely there can be no city in the world where there is so much
to see as in Paris. With our time all our own, we spent day after
day in the Louvre and the Palace of Luxembourg, enthralled with
gazing upon the renowned paintings and sculptures they contained.
We wandered in the lovely gardens of the Tuileries, and up and
down the famous streets, feasting our eyes upon the treasures the
shops contained. We explored the Latin Quarter and had delightful
little meals at the cheap restaurants frequented by the students
there.</p>

<p>Then on Sunday mornings we would occasionally go to one of the
fashionable churches and hear the Mass sung, with the music so
glorious and the incense and the beautiful surroundings so
appealing to the senses that it was often a greater treat to me
even than a visit to the Opera.</p>

<p>We went to the Opera only when escorted by Mr. de Touraine and
then our visit there was always preceded by dinner at some
expensive restaurant. The meals of rich food brought seemingly
from all parts of the world were a revelation to me and, watching
the other diners with the wonderful gowns of the women and their
jewels of an unsurpassed beauty, would leave me almost
spell-bound in my delight.</p>

<p>Mr. de Touraine had always been most kind to me, but in time
his kindness became a little embarrassing, as he started upon a
sort of mild flirtation with me. He made a head study of me,
saying I made an ideal model, as, very different from Madeline, I
could keep so still for such a long time. Then he said he would
like to paint me as Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love rising from
the sea, adding laughingly, that, if he did, of course I should
have to sit for him in the nude. He said I had a beautiful figure
for it.</p>

<p>Madeline was very amused, but greatly to my relief old Mrs. de
Touraine put a damper upon the idea at once. "You stick to
landscapes, Charles," she said sharply. "They're what you can
paint best, and don't go bothering about the figures of young
girls."</p>

<p>We had been just a year in Paris when tragedy came once again
into my life and made me almost think that it was destined I
should bring disaster upon everyone with whom I became
associated. Madeline and her father both died within a few days
of each other, she from typhoid fever and he from heart
failure.</p>

<p>It was a dreadful time for me and took me many, many months
before I felt anything like myself again. I had grown to love
Madeline, quite as much I was sure as I would have ever loved a
sister, and not only was there the grief at losing her, but also
the most uneasy worry as to what was now to become of me. I was
then still under twenty and&mdash;quite reasonably not taking
Mrs. de Touraine into account&mdash;had not a friend in the world
to turn to. What was going to become of me I did not know.</p>

<p>It was well indeed that I was not relying in any way upon Mrs.
de Touraine, as the very day after the second funeral was over
she began making preparations for leaving Paris straightaway and
returning to Canada. Her only relation was a sister in Montreal
who was almost as old as she was.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the two deaths of those so near to her,
seemed to have affected her very little. Rather, they seemed to
draw upon some unsuspected resources of strength, for she became
more active and full of energy than I had ever known her before.
Fortunately, when they had come from Canada, the de Touraine
family had brought few things over with them and, living in
furnished apartments both in Plymouth and Paris, there were only
personal effects to be considered and disposed of.</p>

<p>All her son's belongings, his clothes and his painting things,
she gave away to a charitable institution, and to me, greatly to
my surprise, she gave everything Madeline had possessed.</p>

<p>"You can have everything, dear," she said. "I have no one else
to give them to. You're a good girl and Madeline loved you. So
take everything you want in remembrance of her, and what are not
likely to be of use to you will go with my poor boy's clothes to
the institution."</p>

<p>She was so preoccupied in making arrangements for getting
everything finished up quickly for her getting away that it
seemed only as an afterthought that she asked what I was
intending to do. I told her that to begin with I should go to a
women's hostel I had heard of in Montmartre and from there look
out for a situation as a secretary.</p>

<p>"And I'll give you the best of references," she said, and she
immediately sat down to write one. "But what a pity you've got
such an unpleasant-sounding name like Wiggs," she went on. She
smiled. "If you don't marry soon and change it that way, if I
were you I'd alter it by a legal deed. It can be done, you know,
quite easily."</p>

<p>The night before she and I were both going to leave the
apartment at Boulogne-sur-Seine, when she was in bed and asleep,
I completed my packing. I came upon Madeline's leather
despatch-case. It was locked but I found the key among the
trinkets in her jewellery case. Examining the contents of the
case, for a moment my brain was too numbed to be greatly
interested. In turn I picked up her diary, her English Identity
Card and her passport with the photograph upon it not too
clear.</p>

<p>Then a folded paper turned out to be her birth certificate and
I read that Madeline Marie Louise de Touraine had been born in
Montreal, in Henri Street in the parish of St. Joseph, upon
Friday, July the twelfth in the year nineteen hundred and
three.</p>

<p>I sighed heavily. Born just two days after me and what pretty
names she had! How different must the names of Polly Wiggs have
looked upon my birth certificate! And then I wondered if I had
ever had any birth certificate at all. Certainly, I had some hazy
recollection of once having heard the ten-shilling midwife who
was usually called in by my mother to preside over the births of
her other babies, saying something about my father risking a fine
if within so many days he didn't notify some office or other that
another Wiggs child had come into the world. However, I was well
aware that in Rocker Street Government rules and regulations did
not carry much weight, and so I guessed that quite as likely as
not my father had never troubled to register the births of any of
his children. So, that being so, I sighed again to think that, if
ever I should want a certificate of birth, there would not be one
to be found.</p>

<p>Then, as I stood holding Madeline's certificate in my hand, a
sudden thought flashed into my mind and I felt my face flushing
in my excitement. Why&mdash;why shouldn't I take Madeline's
certificate to be my own, and change my name to hers
straightaway? What was there to prevent it? It would be quite
safe! Not a soul in Paris had known me as Polly Wiggs, and when
on the morrow I quitted our present apartment I could go as Marie
de Touraine&mdash;I preferred Marie to Madeline&mdash;and no one
would know there had been any change of name. Surely, I told
myself, I should get on better in life as Marie de Touraine than
under the ugly-sounding names of Polly Wiggs? Oh, if only I had
the courage to make the change!</p>

<p>Hardly daring to breathe, I tip-toed out in the the passage to
Mrs. de Touraine's door. It was ajar and I could hear her snoring
gently. She was the only danger. Suppose, the next morning she
suddenly remembered about Madeline's private papers, and asked me
for them? I should have to give them up! I couldn't say I had not
found them! Oh, what a lot was depending upon the next few
hours!</p>

<p>That night I slept very badly. Indeed, I think I hardly slept
at all, but the next morning I was up early and getting the old
lady's breakfast. She was brisk and lively and talked of nothing
but herself and the delights of the wonderful voyage in front of
her. It almost seemed she had already forgotten the so recent
deaths of her son and grand-daughter. To my intense relief she
said nothing about Madeline's despatch case and the private
papers. Still, I was so scared she <i>might</i> suddenly
recollect about the birth certificate that it was not until I had
finally seen her train leaving the Gare de St. Lazare that I felt
absolutely safe. She waved as excitedly as a little child from
the window of her carriage as the train drew out. I was confident
I should never see her again, as, with her heart in the condition
the doctors had told her it was, I knew the poor soul could not
have much longer to live.</p>

<p>By noon that same day I was installed in the Women's Hostel in
Montmartre, with a quickly-beating heart having registered there
as Mademoiselle Marie de Touraine. I was devoutly hoping Polly
Wiggs had disappeared for ever.</p>

<p>Now although I am by nature anything but a timid disposition,
and never for one moment regretting having assumed Madeline's
name, it speaks volumes for my state of mind in those first early
days when I was in Paris all alone that it was nearly three weeks
before I could bring myself to make use of it in applying for a
situation.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Touraine seemed so high-sounding and I was
sure it would focus attention upon me at once. Not that I did not
feel confident I would not disgrace the part. I knew I was quite
nice-looking and was well, if quietly dressed. All Madeline's
clothes fitted me as if they had been made for me. Whenever I
went into any restaurant or shop I noticed women always looked at
me well up and down and from their expressions did not find
anything wrong in me. The men of course were interested in me,
too, and seeing I was by myself apparently thought it quite
permissible to give me a good ogle. In particular, the elder men
were a nuisance and when I sat upon a seat in any of the public
gardens, generally it was not very long before one of them would
come to the same seat and try to start a conversation.</p>

<p>However, I never gave any encouragement, and indeed never
troubled to take any notice of an opening remark. Still, some of
them were persistent and once I had to catch a passing gendarme's
eye and ask him to deal with a well-dressed elderly offender.
"This man is annoying me, Monsieur," I said. "I don't know him.
Will you please tell him to leave me alone."</p>

<p>Then it was most gratifying to watch the gendarme's response.
Of small stature, he yet bristled with rage and blew himself out
like a turkey-cock. He grabbed the man roughly by the shoulder
and dragged him a good ten yards away before dismissing him with
a not over-gentle kick. Returning to me, he was most apologetic.
"I am sorry, Mademoiselle," he said, "but I'm sure he won't annoy
you again." He nodded in the direction of my admirer who was
slinking away as quickly as he could. "The old rooster! He's
probably got a wife and half a dozen children at home. The older
they get, the worse they are," and he left me with the nicest of
smiles and a most courtly bow.</p>

<p>The three idle weeks I gave myself I looked upon as a sort of
holiday, to recover from the shock of Madeline's and her father's
deaths and to acquire confidence in myself, not only as
Mademoiselle de Touraine but as a young girl who had been so
suddenly thrown upon her own resources to fight the world
alone.</p>

<p>I returned again and again to many of the places I had visited
with Madeline, but it was the Louvre which always fascinated me
most and hardly a day passed without my going there to have a
look at the glorious paintings and sculptures it contained. How I
wished I could become an artist myself! I had grown to love
beautiful things and to be able to create them myself I thought
must be one of the greatest joys that life could give.</p>

<p>The days quickly passing, I realised I must delay no longer
and start in earnest about getting something to do. Though I had
been receiving &pound;6 a month all the time I had been with the
de Touraines, I had not saved a single penny of it, as I had
always been very scrupulous to pay my share of all the outings
Madeline and I had had together. Still, I was not as yet in any
way short of money, as I had kept intact the &pound;50 Colonel
Jasper had given me. Also, if things ever came to a pinch I had
little pieces of Madeline's jewellery which Mrs. de Touraine had
given me. However, Madeline had never been fond of jewels and,
except for her wrist-watch which was a very expensive one of gold
with a diamond-studded case and platinum chain, the money I
should obtain from their sale would not last me very long. One
other thing of a little value I certainly <i>did</i> have and
that was the gold bangle Mrs. Rahm had given me. It was solid and
heavy and even to my inexperienced eye, looked good.</p>

<p>With my first attempt to obtain work I thought I had landed a
good position very easily. Seeing an advertisement in <i>Le
Soir</i> for a confidential typist, I went to interview the
advertiser. I found his office in a building in a good-class
locality just off the Boulevard Germain and I saw by the notice
painted up that he was an Exporter and Importer. At once I was of
the opinion the omens were good, as my English would be most
useful. I now spoke and read French fluently. In the outer office
I noticed two elderly women clerks. Shown into the advertiser, I
found him a smartly-dressed man about forty. He asked me a number
of questions and everything seemed to be going well. I was to
start working for him the following week. Finally, he suggested I
should come out to lunch with him when we would continue the
conversation.</p>

<p>He took me to quite a good restaurant and over a good meal,
and a bottle of Burgundy which, of course, I in part shared with
him, he became most confidential. He asked me a lot of questions
about myself and seemed surprised I was living alone in Paris.
Presently I felt his foot pressing mine under the table and,
thinking it was an accident, drew my own away. However, his came
back against mine at once and I knew this time the movement was
intentional.</p>

<p>I know I got very hot, for it was as if a bomb had burst
suddenly in my mind, and I was disgusted both with myself as well
as with him. So that was the sort of man he was and, as I looked
at his bold and sparkling eyes I thought what a little fool I had
been not to have summed him directly I saw him! Why, if he
started becoming as familiar as this after less than an hour's
acquaintance what would he be expecting of me after a few days'
employment in his office? Oh, what a lot I had to learn if I was
to take proper care of myself!</p>

<p>And then the humour of it struck me and I wanted to laugh.
Evidently the beast must be thinking he had made an immediate
conquest of me! I smiled as if in amusement and now let my foot
remain where it was. At any rate I was having an experience and a
nice meal at his expense! Also, before getting up from the table
I let him buy me a large-sized packet of expensive English
cigarettes.</p>

<p>We parted, apparently, upon the most friendly terms and then,
having given him as I thought enough time to get back to his
office, I phoned up there and gave a curt message to the girl who
answered that she was to tell her employer the situation would
not suit me. Thinking of the good English cigarettes he had
bought me I hoped I had taught him a lesson. I congratulated
myself that he had forgotten to ask me for my address.</p>

<p>My meeting with this man greatly depressed me and brought home
to me the seriousness of the warning Mr. de Touraine had so often
given us two girls when we had been setting out upon our almost
daily wanderings round the city. He said it was well recognised
that of all the highly emotional Latin countries, France led the
way in their worship of sex. Sex with them was the lodestar of
life with its pursuit coming before everything else in the world.
"That's why," he would wind up, "their Governments are so
unstable. To get any favour out of a politician you must not go
to him or his wife, but must approach his mistress, as he is sure
to have one. Through nearly all the histories of their important
public men illicit love has been a prominent factor of their
lives," and he would shake his head warningly at us as he watched
us go out.</p>

<p>My next attempt, however, to obtain a situation was a very
prosaic and matter-of-fact 'turn-down,' because I had no
knowledge of shorthand. It was a woman who interviewed me this
time and I wasn't with her three minutes.</p>

<p>A few mornings later, with my spirits at rather low ebb, I
found myself in the Louvre again, standing before the painting I
loved best there, that of the mighty de Vinci's famous
masterpiece <i>Mona Lisa.</i> Painted all those hundreds of years
ago, the secret of the haunting smile upon the woman's face had
continued to intrigue the millions who had come to gaze upon it,
with its mystery remaining as impenetrable and insoluble as ever.
I thought with a deep sigh that no one would ever learn what was
in the artist's mind when he painted her.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the idea swept into my mind that, while I could
certainly never create anything artistic myself, was it not
possible I might yet help others to do so? Why should I not
become an artist's model? Mr. de Touraine, no poor artist
himself, had so often said that with my good figure I had all the
necessary qualifications to become an ideal one.</p>

<p>I remembered, too, what had happened once when we were dining,
of course at Mr. de Touraine's expense, in one of the most
fashionable and expensive restaurants of the city! A beautiful
and exquisitely gowned woman of a proud and even haughty bearing
had swept in the salon, and the aristocratic Maitre of the
restaurant had at once proceeded to bow her reverently to one of
the best tables.</p>

<p>"Look, look," had whispered Mr. de Touraine in an excited
manner that was quite unusual with him, "that's Etienne
Ramoutier, the great artist's model." He sighed deeply. "Isn't
she a lovely woman?"</p>

<p>"And she looks quite respectable, too," had commented
Madeline.</p>

<p>"Respectable!" had scowled her father. "I should think she
<i>is</i> respectable! Why, she's as conventional and chaste as
any woman can be. The king of a great country&mdash;it's not wise
to mention his name&mdash;has made several passes at her for her
favours, but she's turned him down as if he were the lowest
kitchen-boy in some disreputable hotel." He had seemed quite
angry. "Let me tell you, young lady, an artist's model may be
quite as, what you call, respectable as any Archbishop or Prince
of the Church."</p>

<p>Full of my idea, that morning to think with me was to act at
once, and within an hour I was interviewing Monsieur Thiery the
proprietor of a big artist's supply store which I had once heard
Mr. de Touraine say was patronised by the tip-top of the
profession.</p>

<p>Monsieur Thiery was a kindly fatherly-looking man in the
middle forties and at once showed his interest in me. "So you
want to become a model, do you?" he said. "Oh, you've had some
experience, have you?" He regarded me critically. "Well, you
certainly seem to me to have all the requirements." He smiled.
"Quite a good-looking face and, what is more important, a very
nice figure. I'll see what I can do for you."</p>

<p>He left me for a few minutes and I heard him speaking
energetically upon the phone. Returning to me, his face was a
beaming one. "You are fortunate, Mademoiselle," he exclaimed.
"I've just been having a word with an old friend of mine,
Monsieur de Vallon, the Principal of the de Vallon Art Academy.
He's a painter himself and has taught many of our rising artists.
It happens he's wanting a model and you are to go to him tomorrow
morning at ten o'clock for an inspection. He's a charming man,
but don't be disappointed if he doesn't take you, as I warn you
he's a very, very particular man."</p>

<p>I thanked him warmly and the following morning, with my heart
beating quickly, arrived at the de Vallon Academy. It was quite a
good-sized building off the Boulevard Montparnasse. I was
interviewed first by his secretary to whom I gave a small card
upon which I had written my name. I was kept waiting a few
minutes and was then ushered into Monsieur de Vallon's private
office.</p>

<p>He was a small man about Monsieur Thiery's size with a large
head, white hair and very big shrewd eyes under very big brows.
He looked very active and the personification of energy. He bowed
politely. "Ah, Mademoiselle de Touraine," he exclaimed looking
down at my card which he held in his hand. "A good name! Then of
course, you are descended from the Navarres?" he nodded, "You
look as if you might be, too."</p>

<p>He motioned me to a seat in front of his desk and for a long
minute stared very hard at me, his eyes wandering up and down
from my figure to my face and then to my figure again.</p>

<p>"Stand up, please, Mademoiselle," he ordered. "Drop your hands
to your sides and keep quite still," and the scrutiny continued.
He rose from his own chair and walked round so that he could take
in everything about me in profile. Then he made me stand upon a
weighing machine, and after that took my height from a
measurement upon the wall. He made a note upon a card which he
had taken out of his desk. Finally, he touched the bell upon his
desk and his secretary reappeared.</p>

<p>"Help this young lady to undress," he said curtly, "everything
to the waist, vest and brassieres." He took a tape measure out of
a drawer and laid it upon his desk. "The measurements, too,
please; the thigh, halfway up above the knee; the leg from the
hip-joint to the sole of the foot, the hips, the arm from the
shoulder to the wrist and the wrist to the tip of the
forefinger," and he turned to a small wash-basin in the corner of
the room and proceeded to wash his hands.</p>

<p>Bare to the waist, strangely enough I did not feel a bit
ashamed or even shy and I am sure there was no heightened colour
upon my face. The whole matter was being carried on in such a
business-like way that it might almost have been that I was only
going to have a photograph of my face taken, in an ordinary
photographer's studio.</p>

<p>His hands washed and dried, Monsieur de Vallon put down on the
card the measurements his secretary had called out and then
turned to me. "Now, Mademoiselle," he said very quietly, "you
seem to be quite a sensible girl and are realising that your body
is no more to me than a piece of furniture. You have come to me
asking to be employed as a model for my pupils and I am just
ascertaining if you are symmetrical enough." He moved up close to
me with the tape measure in his hand. "So, now I am going to take
the measurement of your bust. It is most important and I always
do that myself. Stand up and keep quite still, please. Don't
strain yourself to be unduly erect. Just stand naturally and
breathe as shallowly as you can."</p>

<p>He cupped each of my breasts in turn with his hand and nodded.
"Firm as they should be. The typical virgin bust!"</p>

<p>He was most careful in his measurement, passing the tape round
me several times before he was satisfied. Then he motioned me
back in my chair and went through all the measurements noted on
the card. For the first time he smiled, a warm congratulatory
smile. "An almost perfect bust, Mademoiselle," he exclaimed. He
tapped the card. "Falling into accord with the other measurements
here, it is within a few millimetres of absolute perfection. How
old are you?"</p>

<p>I certainly flushed now at his enthusiasm. "Not quite twenty
yet, Monsieur," I replied. "I shall be twenty in July."</p>

<p>He frowned slightly. "Then you must be careful of yourself,
Mademoiselle," he exclaimed, "very careful, as you have come to
this condition of, almost perfection nearly a year earlier than
might have been expected. Your danger is that of becoming too
plump. Keep off too much sugar and rich cakes." A thought struck
him. "You are not betrothed?" he asked. "Good! Then have you some
fortunate <i>bel ami?</i> No! Then better still! You keep away
from <i>les jeunes messieurs</i> and then the better for the
symmetry of your bust." He sighed. "The good God has given to
woman the loveliness of her form to attract and then when the
attraction has done its work "&mdash;he shrugged his
shoulders&mdash;"it has been particularly at the expense of the
symmetry of the bust. Marriage and maternity spell disaster in
that respect."</p>

<p>He spoke in brisk and business-like tones. "Yes, I shall be
delighted to engage you for my pupils. Two mornings a week to
begin with and you can start on Monday at nine o'clock. I will
pay you fifty francs an hour for your services."</p>

<p>"But I shan't have to sit in the complete nude?" I asked a
little timidly.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No, at any rate not at first. That may
come later for the advanced pupils and then your remunerations
will be greater. The standing position is very tiring."</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and shook hands with me. "So goodbye for
the present and now you go into the next room with my secretary
and she will give you a little advice as you re-dress
yourself."</p>

<p>Alone with the secretary, I said how delighted I was Monsieur
was going to take me. "But do models," I asked, "sit for a whole
hour without moving?"</p>

<p>"They do when they get used to it," she replied, "though at
first they certainly find it rather tiring. Anyhow, Monsieur will
break off for a few minutes if he sees you are tiring. He's most
considerate with all his models." She laughed. "He's very shy,
too, with all the mesdemoiselles and that's why he wants me to
tell you to shave under your arms before you come on Monday. I'm
sure that's what he meant by saying I was to give you
advice."</p>

<p>I crimsoned up in mortification at my ignorance. I had never
as yet worn a sleeveless gown and was disgusted to think what an
inexperienced girl Monsieur de Vallon must have thought me. I was
still flushing when I went out into the street.</p>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br>

THE WEAKNESS OF A WOMAN</h2>

<p class="first">IT might have been thought I should have been
feeling very nervous as I approached the Art Academy upon the
following Monday morning, but no&mdash;I took it all in my
stride and went on to the platform to face the sea of upturned
faces as if I had been accustomed to doing it all my life.
Certainly, Monsieur de Vallon who was the only one present there
who knew it was my first experience as a model, was a great
encouragement to me with his business-like manner and yet kindly
smile.</p>

<p>As his secretary had told me he would be, he was most
considerate with me, taking care when I was upon the platform it
was sufficiently warm. I had a tall screen behind me and a
radiator at my feet. Upon the screen was pinned a thermometer and
he saw to it that the temperature did not fall below
seventy-five.</p>

<p>"That is the right temperature," he whispered to me, "for you
unclothed as you are. A chill is what a model should be always
most careful to guard against."</p>

<p>Then, after a quarter of an hour he gave me a few minutes'
rest and, when the sitting was finished, he took me into a little
room and shared some hot coffee and biscuits with me.</p>

<p>"Nothing very formidable about it, is there," he smiled, "and
you need never meet any of the pupils afterwards. I should keep
myself quite aloof from them if I were you." He shook his head
sagely. "They say Paris is a wicked city, but all places in the
world can be wicked for young people if they do not place a
proper value upon themselves. We know that in these days chastity
is supposed to have lost its halo, but the wise young ladies will
never forget they can be only maiden once." He smiled again. "I
am speaking to you as I would to my daughters, because I can see
you have not had much worldly experience yet, and when private
artists offer you work as they certainly will do&mdash;" he
hesitated just a few moments, "&mdash;I should like you to
understand I shall always be most happy to advise you if it be
wise for you to go to them."</p>

<p>I thanked him warmly and, looking back in after years,
realised what a good friend I had made in him.</p>

<p>As he had said, I soon had offers of more work, and indeed in
a few months had as much as I could do and was able to pick and
choose from whom I should accept employment.</p>

<p>The private artists paid much better than the Academy did,
particularly those ones whose paintings were selling well, and I
would often get from these latter the equivalent of two to three
English pounds for a few sittings upon different days. The nude
was nothing new to me now and, as Monsieur de Vallon told me once
when I was spending a Sunday with him and his wife and family at
their home&mdash;he had a charming wife with three very pretty
grown-up daughters&mdash;absolute nudity was a far greater
protection to a woman than when she was wearing scanty clothes.
"There is nothing left to the imagination then," he smiled, "and
it is the imagination which always plays such a large part in the
stirring up of the emotions to a dangerous pitch."</p>

<p>With my rapidly increasing earnings, I felt quite safe in
leaving the Hostel and renting a flat in Passy, only a few miles
distant from the city. The flat was very small and consisted only
of two rooms, a kitchenette and a bathroom, but, as I had all
along set my face against making friends, it was quite big enough
for me, receiving as I did no visitors.</p>

<p>Certainly my life was a lonely one, but for all that it was
quite a happy one. I read a lot, I went to concerts, to the
Opera, to cinemas and the theatres and, when I did not dine out,
cooked myself delicious little meals. Apart from the de Vallons
and those I had met at work, I had practically no contacts with
anyone.</p>

<p>And now I come to the most humiliating part of my life, the
very memory of which can, even after all these years, make me
grow hot in shame whenever I recall it. It is a dreadful
confession, for I had always considered myself as immune to all
the weaknesses of my sex and able to protect myself from
everyone.</p>

<p>With no real thought for what I was doing and with hardly any
fighting against it, I yielded up my chastity as wantonly as any
little slum girl in Rocker Street might have discarded hers for
sixpenny-worth of chocolates and a few hot kisses snatched in
some dark corner. My downfall came about in this way.</p>

<p>Turner Meynall of middle age, well-known English artist and an
Associate of the Royal Academy, had set up a studio in Paris,
because, as he said the atmosphere there was more congenial for
inspiration, and he was painting me as Vesta, the Goddess of
Fire, attended by her maidens in the temple. It was a painting in
the nude, but I never had the slightest misgivings at being alone
with him, as in every way a gentleman he always treated me with
the utmost deference. Of a reserved disposition, he spoke very
little to me, but always greeted me with a charming and
encouraging smile.</p>

<p>A nephew of his, Anton Meynall, arrived to share the studio
with him and I could see that he was interested in me from the
very first. Twenty-six years old, he looked younger than that and
I took him to be a nice, happy clean-living boy. Standing in
great awe of his uncle, he never spoke much to me when he was
there, but when, as it sometimes happened, we were alone for a
few minutes he opened out at once and was very bright and chatty,
talking about art in general but managing to get in a few
compliments about what a beautiful goddess I made.</p>

<p>Certainly, I came to like him. He was good-looking and full of
fun, but he never stirred the slightest emotion in me and his
compliments only amused me. I felt rather sorry for him, too, as
he was a poor artist and even I could see he would never meet
with any success.</p>

<p>Encountering me in the street one afternoon, apparently by
chance, though I was to learn later he had been on the look-out
for me to pass by, after a few casual remarks he suggested we
should go to Rumpelmazer's for tea. Rumpelmazer was a great
patisserie chef and renowned the world over for his delicious
cakes. I had not been to his place as yet, mainly because
everything was so excessively dear, costing twice and even three
times more than at everywhere else.</p>

<p>At first I laughingly refused, but as he really seemed so
eager about it I ultimately gave in and went. We spent a very
pleasant hour together and I remember I ate so much that I cooked
no dinner for myself that night.</p>

<p>The ice broken, with some little uneasiness at doing so, I
went with him to a few concerts and twice to the Races at
Chantilly upon a Sunday afternoon. I was very lucky there upon
both occasions, the second time winning more than a thousand
francs at the Pari-Matuel, about &pound;14 in English money at
the then rate of exchange.</p>

<p>All the time his uncle knew nothing about my going out with
him, Anton being quite as anxious as I was that he should learn
nothing of it. Anton said Mr. Turner Meynall was cold as a fish
and would not understand, while I took the view that, with him
never unbending enough to speak of anything but the work he was
engaging me for, I would be as equally reticent about myself.</p>

<p>Then one Sunday morning when sitting upon a seat in the
Luxembourg Gardens, to my amazement Anton suddenly asked me to
marry him. When I had got over my surprise, I treated his
proposal as a joke. "Why, I know nothing about you," I laughed,
"and, besides, I'm sure I'm not the kind of girl who'll ever
marry anyone. I don't feel for men in that way."</p>

<p>"What, you've never been in love?" he asked in great
surprise.</p>

<p>"No, I'm never likely to be," I said.</p>

<p>"But I should make you such a good husband," he pleaded. "I've
got a nice little private income and we should be so happy
together."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," I laughed. "I'd make a horrid wife, as I'm
as cold as the fish you say your uncle is," and I warned him that
if he ever asked me again it would be the end of our outings
together.</p>

<p>He <i>did</i> ask me twice more, but each time appeared to
accept my refusal as so final that I did not carry out my threat
of coming out no more with him.</p>

<p>Then came the fatal night. He had often taunted me that he did
not believe I could really be the good cook I was making out I
was and so, out of bravado, I said he could come to supper at my
flat and he would see what I could do.</p>

<p>He was taking me to the Opera that evening and the divine
melodies of Wagner's <i>Lohengrin</i> thrilled me through and
through. Never before had I realised how stirring and arousing
sensual music could be. Afterwards, going home in the taxi I
allowed him to hold my hand without demur. Up to then I had never
allowed him to touch me except in the briefest of handshakes.</p>

<p>He had brought a bottle of champagne with him and that alone
should have warned me of the red lights. I was accustomed to only
the very lightest of wines and, though I did not know what was
happening, I experienced at once its releasing effects. I was
thirsty and drank glass for glass with him.</p>

<p>It was a simple but dainty little meal I had prepared for him,
salmon mayonnaise, a galantine of chicken, potato salad and some
delicious little cakes. All of a sudden, however, I seemed to
have lost all appetite for food and I saw it was the same with
him. In the perfect health of youth, alas! it was more than food
we wanted, though I, at least, was not realising it.</p>

<p>He helped me wash up and we were very silent as we did so.
Then he said sadly, "And I suppose it's good-bye now. Anyhow,
I've had a lovely evening and I'm sure that you'll be sweet
enough to give me just one kiss before I go."</p>

<p>I made no reply, but I know I was smiling at him and so he
took consent for granted. He put his arm round my waist and
pulled me gently to him. He tilted up my chin and kissed me upon
the mouth.</p>

<p>The kiss was a long one and I felt myself shuddering. I had
never been kissed by any man before and the sensation loosed in
me a terrible wave of passion. He repeated his kiss, a much
harder one this time and I kissed him back. He put my arms round
his neck and I closed them spasmodically. My knees were trembling
under me and, lifting me in his arms, he sank back into an
arm-chair with me upon his knees. I felt weak as water and I knew
it was all over with me. In my then abandonment I could refuse
nothing to him.</p>

<p>He did not leave my flat until dawn was breaking and then it
was he who said he must go before anyone in the building was
about and saw him.</p>

<p>No, I didn't cry when he had gone and for the time being felt
no remorse. In those few short hours all my outlook upon life
seemed to have altered and the thrill of my awakened womanhood
was still stirring in me! He was a dear boy, I told myself, and,
of course, I loved him! If I did not I comforted myself, as a
decent girl I should certainly have not yielded him as I had
done. Now I should settle down happily to a full life of wifehood
and motherhood. After all, could there be anything more wonderful
in all the world than holding one's own baby in one's arms?</p>

<p>Unhappily for my peace of mind this mood did not last very
long and, reaction setting in, before night had come I was
upbraiding myself as the worst of abject little fools for having
spoilt my whole life for a few short moments of passion. I did
not <i>love</i> the boy I told myself. I had only <i>liked</i>
him, with my main feeling for him being one of amusement that he
had been so persistent in wanting me to become his wife upon so
short an acquaintanceship.</p>

<p>I did not see him for two days. He did not come near his
uncle's studio on the Monday or the Tuesday, because, I was sure,
he was ashamed of what he had done. By then I was becoming very
worried and angry with him. He must marry me at once, as I might
be going to have a baby, and I had certainly no intention of
letting people point scornfully at me as a girl who had given
herself up to her lover in pre-nuptial days.</p>

<p>With his keeping out of my way, which I was now certain he was
doing purposely, I thought with horror how undignified it would
be if I had to go and search him out at his uncle's private
apartment where I knew he was living. Still, I was determined to
do it, at whatever cost.</p>

<p>However, I was saved the shame there, as I found him waiting
for me in the street on the Wednesday afternoon at the time when
he knew I should be leaving the studio. Certainly, though
appearing to be rather shy, he seemed so genuinely pleased to see
me that all my anger melted at once. He accounted for his not
meeting me before by explaining he had got soaked to the skin
when walking home in the rain in the early hours of that Monday
morning and it had brought on a bit of a chill. However, he said
he was quite all right again now and asked if he might accompany
me home as there was so much which had to be talked over.</p>

<p>"But you're going to marry me?" I asked sharply.</p>

<p>He looked very hurt. "Of course, I'm going to, darling," he
said, "and I'm the luckiest man in the world to have won you for
my wife."</p>

<p>Greatly relieved, after I had bought some cutlets for our
evening meal, which he insisted upon paying for, we went home on
the top of a tram and he squeezed my arm so affectionately and
talked so gaily of our future prospects, that I felt very ashamed
of myself for having doubted him.</p>

<p>Over the meal he said he was going to put up the banns in the
morning at the English church in the Rue de Guise and we would be
married in three weeks. He said he would not buy me the
engagement ring yet, because I would not be able to wear it
openly, as it would be wiser, in both our interests, that his
uncle should learn nothing until we were actually man and
wife.</p>

<p>"Of course, he would be against it," he laughed, "as he has
always preached I must not think of marrying until I have been
more successful with my painting."</p>

<p>After the meal he stayed on, and at once started making love
to me again. Reluctantly at first, I was soon responding to his
mood. I knew I was now so completely in his power that I must
give in to please him in every way he wanted. I thought sadly of
the so vaunted equality of the sexes. Her feet once placed upon a
certain path, how difficult, and indeed at times how impossible,
it was for a woman to retrace her steps. She had given and there
can be no taking back of her gift. She had sold, and woe-betide
her if she had not seen to it that she has been paid the price
before-hand.</p>

<p>So, for the ensuing ten days we continued on as lovers, and of
an evening, after we had been out to dine somewhere or had gone
to a show, he would come back home with me to my flat as a matter
of course. As the time when we were to be married came nearer I
thought more than once that he was uneasy about something, but
put it down to what he was anticipating his uncle would say when
he learnt we had done everything without his knowledge. I knew
his uncle had done a lot for him and no doubt it did seem rather
ungrateful to be keeping him in the dark.</p>

<p>Then at the end of the next week I was rather surprised and a
little uneasy that I saw nothing of Anton either upon the
Saturday or the Sunday. In my precarious position as an unwedded
wife anything unusual in any way tended to make me feel nervous
and I was always fearful of his meeting with some accident which
would postpone or even prevent our being married.</p>

<p>On the Monday morning I went to Turner Meynall's studio as
usual and nothing happened until the sitting was over and I was
about to bid him good-bye. Then he said sharply, "Oh, by-the-bye,
I saw you in the Rue de Rivoli with my nephew on Friday evening
and, if you are becoming friendly with him, I don't think it
quite the right thing." He eyed me curiously. "Has he told you
he's a married man?"</p>

<p>For the moment I could not take in what he had said, and then
I went cold in consternation and horror. My tongue clove to the
roof of my mouth and I felt choking as if I could not breathe. I
just stared at him and made no reply. Evidently he saw how he had
upset me, as he tactfully turned round and busied himself with
putting his brushes away.</p>

<p>"Yes," he went on casually, "he's married, though he's not
living with his wife. She might divorce him, as he's given her
plenty of cause to, but she won't do it because she's a devout
Catholic and instead, very sensibly, she gives him an allowance
to keep away from her. She's well-off, but he has nothing. The
rascal only married her for her money."</p>

<p>He was looking at me again now and spoke with the utmost
kindness. "In any case he won't bother either of us any more. On
Saturday I gave him a sharp talking to for paying you attention
and yesterday packed him back to England by plane. We are both
well rid of him, the young blackguard."</p>

<p>And all the time I had not spoken. What I should have said or
done I never like to think over, as I am sure I should have
broken down and burst into tears. Happily, at that moment a
brother artist arrived at the studio and, on their warm greeting
to each other, I managed to slip away, just pulling myself
together enough to say a quick good afternoon to Mr. Meynall.</p>

<p>I reached the street in the grip of a dreadful terror, as only
that very morning I had realised I was probably
<i>enceinte.</i></p>

<p>Two days later I received a letter from Anton. It was
postmarked London, but had no address and he had not even signed
his name. It had no preamble and ran to only five lines. He
wrote,</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">I am the vilest of all the vile men God ever
made. I won't ask you to forgive me, for you never can. It is no
excuse that I was crazy with love of you. I would kill myself if
I dared. All I pray now that I may be punished mercilessly in
this world and the next.</p>

<br>

<p>I read it only once and then thrust it into the fire. What a
mad woman I had been, but, at any risk, I told myself, I would
not bear his child.</p>

<p>I never knew how I managed to endure the misery of the few
weeks which followed, as there was soon no doubt that I was going
to have a child. The one bright spot was that Monsieur de Vallon
was away. With the strain of his work threatening a nervous
breakdown, he had gone for a long holiday to South Africa.
Otherwise, with him there, I should never have dared to sit at
the Academy again, for with his eagle eyes upon me, I was sure he
would have at once noticed a difference in my bust. I remembered
so vividly how he had said that even sweethearting would affect
its symmetry, and in a pregnant woman&mdash;God! he would have
seen the change the moment I sat myself before his pupils.</p>

<p>Now I was not despairing of being able to keep my shame from
the world. With the confident assurance of one who really knew
nothing of what she was talking about, it was in my mind how
Madeline had once told me that in cases such as mine it was wise
to wait a few weeks before trying to get help. So I would wait, I
told myself, until the following month before consulting any
doctor. Then I would consult the best women's physician that I
could hear of. I didn't expect he himself would do what I wanted,
but with Romance making such a strong appeal to every Frenchman I
felt confident he would recommend me to someone else who
would.</p>

<p>However, as if at last Fate were repenting for the evil she
had brought upon me, she dealt me the ace of trumps from the pack
and the whole matter was put right for me in a totally unexpected
way.</p>

<p>Paris was in the grip of a bad and wide-spread epidemic of
influenza and one morning, after having had all the preliminary
symptoms the previous day, I found myself feeling so wretchedly
ill that it was all I could do to summon the
<i>conci&eacute;rge</i> of the building and ask him to send his
wife to me.</p>

<p>She was a kind, motherly woman and telephoned for a doctor at
once. He turned out to be younger than at first sight I would
have liked, apparently being still only in the twenties, but he
seemed so clever and capable that in a very few minutes I had
complete confidence in him. He told me I had more than an attack
of influenza, as I had a pneumonic patch upon both lungs. He said
I must go into hospital without delay. He recommended a private
one where I should receive the best treatment, and went down to
the conci&eacute;rge's lodge to telephone and make all
arrangements.</p>

<p>He returned to my apartment to be with me until the ambulance
should arrive and, learning I had no relations in Paris who would
look after me, showed himself to be of such a kind and
sympathetic nature that, giving way to tears, I choked out the
dreadful trouble I was in.</p>

<p>I told him everything and how the man who was responsible for
my condition had turned out to be already a married man and left
me without a word. I asked him if, later, when I had recovered
from the pneumonia would he help me.</p>

<p>He listened very solemnly to my story, but, when I had
finished his only comment was, "One thing at a time,
Mademoiselle. We will see."</p>

<p>In the days which followed I know I was a very sick girl,
indeed I learned afterwards that for three days my condition was
so critical that it was not expected I would live. Happily, I
knew nothing of what was happening then, as I was mercifully
unconscious for most of the time. However, a strong constitution
pulled me through and soon I was taking an interest in life
again. Looking back, really I think one of the most joyful
moments of my life came when the young doctor whispered to me
that I need worry no more as I was out of all my trouble now.</p>

<p>That was all he had need to tell me. My dreadful illness had
proved a blessing in disguise. He was one of the most tactful men
I have ever met and, finding out from me in a roundabout way that
I was in good funds and had no need to consider expense, he kept
me in the hospital as long as possible and until I was well into
a good convalescence. Then he insisted I must take a long holiday
and suggested my going to the Riviera.</p>

<p>"I know a splendid little pension in the old part of Nice," he
said, "that would just suit you; quiet, yet not dull, as it is in
the heart of everything that is going on. The food is excellent,
as the proprietor is an old chef."</p>

<p>So to Nice I went, and I found the pension was all my nice
young doctor had said it would be, beautifully run and with food
as good as that of any hotel. It was not one patronised much by
visitors, because of its unfashionable position in the old town,
the guests being nearly all 'permanents,' good solid business men
and women of middle-age.</p>

<p>With my health getting better every day, whatever attractions
I had had before by illness soon returned, and the men would have
liked to make quite a fuss of me. One old gentleman, well up in
the sixties, in particular, paid me a lot of attention. It
happened that he sat next to me at meals and he was always
pressing me to share his bottle of wine.</p>

<p>He was an Englishman, a Mr. Robert Chapel, and he confided in
me that for many years he had been in the diamond business in
Hatton Garden, but was now partly retired, giving only expert
advice to the big jewellery firms upon the Riviera.</p>

<p>"You see, Mademoiselle," he said, "handling precious stones as
I have been doing for half a century and longer they are now in
my blood and&mdash;" he bowed gallantly, "&mdash;except for the
face of a beautiful woman, the most lovely things in the world to
me."</p>

<p>Laughing at his compliment, I asked, "But can there be much
demand for such expert advice as yours among the jewellers here
in the Riviera? They don't deal with the same quality of
jewellery that you see in the Paris shops, do they?"</p>

<p>He looked shocked. "My dear Mademoiselle," he said, earnestly,
"at the height of the season here jewels of great value change
hands without any remark, almost day by day. Why it is nothing
for my great friend, Fran&ccedil;ois Bethune upon the Boulevard
Charlemagne here to sell a necklace or other piece of jewellery
priced at two hundred thousand francs or even more. His house is
as well-known as Manton's in the Rue de Rivoli in Paris." He
smiled. "Somehow I must manage to get you taken over his
<i>atelier</i> and have you shown some of the glorious pieces he
turns out. He is a famous goldsmith, as well as famous as a
dealer in precious stones. I have known him for over forty years.
Yes, I'll find an opportunity for him to show you his
treasures."</p>

<p>And he found the opportunity very soon, when I had been
staying at the pension for about six weeks. Monsieur Bethune's
place of business was more like a salon for the gathering of
notable people than a place where things were bought and sold.
Situated in the best part of Nice, it was beautifully appointed,
with rich carpets, valuable paintings and etchings upon the
walls, and elaborate and expensive art furniture. Monsieur
himself was a distinguished-looking old gentleman of benign and
artistic appearance, far more like, I thought, some fashionable
physician than a trader, no matter how beautiful might be the
things he was trading in. He appeared not to be in the best of
health and carried one arm in a sling.</p>

<p>He took us into his private room and from a big safe brought
out parcel after parcel of precious stones, as beautiful to me as
any I had seen upon the lovely Society women in Paris. He let me
handle them and explained exactly what made one more valuable
than another.</p>

<p>"And I suppose, Mademoiselle," he smiled, "that, as with so
many of your charming sex, you think there can be no stone as
beautiful as a diamond." He shook his head. "Still, I don't quite
altogether agree there as, if you take away its sparkle, the
diamond is by no means so much more beautiful than all other
stones."</p>

<p>"I think so, too," I nodded. I laughed. "Of course, I've never
possessed or even actually handled one, but I like a big ruby
best, but it must be a striking carmine red one."</p>

<p>"Ah, then I'll show you something," he exclaimed with
enthusiasm and, turning back to his safe, he brought out the
usual tissue-wrapped little packet and unfolded it. "Now here are
rubies of a very fine quality," he went on, "real, what we call,
pigeon-blood rubies. They come from a deep valley, more than four
thousand feet above the sea, near to as dirty and evil-smelling a
little town as you could find anywhere, Magok in Upper Burma. As
you see they are very beautiful, so beautiful that I wonder why
the two biggest here were not kept to adorn an idol in some
Buddhist temple there."</p>

<p>I handled them with becoming awe: their colour, that of the
richest blood, fascinated me.</p>

<p>"And it's funny the tricks old Mother Nature plays upon us,"
laughed Monsieur Bethune, "for these glorious rubies are first
cousins to the common emery stone&mdash;the emery powder which we
use to polish our knife blades and other steel things. In a way,
it is just that the ruby is transparent and the emery is
not."</p>

<p>He made a grimace of pain and explained apologetically that he
was suffering from one of the bad attacks of neuritis he so often
got. "Last night I was walking the floor nearly all night."</p>

<p>"Have you ever tried massage?" I asked.</p>

<p>He nodded. "But it makes it worse. I think the masseur was
rough."</p>

<p>"Well, sometime ago," I said, "I used to massage an old
gentleman friend and it did him no end of good. In fact it took
away all his pain."</p>

<p>Monsieur Bethune was most interested. "Then you are a
masseuse?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not a professional one," I said. "I'm really an artist's
model by profession, and I am down here on the Riviera for a long
holiday after an attack of pneumonia. No, I've had only private
lessons in massage, but I learnt from an old Indian woman who was
splendid at it. Some of her relations had been Yogis in Tibet and
she believed that all ills of the body could be cured by deep
breathing and the human touch. That's why she taught me how to
massage."</p>

<p>Monsieur Bethune had become quite excited. "Then will you see
what you can do to me?" he pleaded. "I should be so grateful if
you will take away my pain."</p>

<p>I hesitated at first, saying I was out of practice, but then,
mainly to please Mr. Chapel, my pension friend, I consented, and
that afternoon Monsieur Bethune's sumptuous car took me up to his
private residence. It was a magnificent place and, as with his
reception rooms upon the Boulevard Charlemagne, everything was
beautifully appointed, with no expense having been spared.
Remembering Mrs. Rahm's teaching that all health treatments
should deal with the mind as well as the body, I made quite a
solemn and important business of the massaging.</p>

<p>I asked for the room to be only dimly lighted and enjoined
there should be no talking while I was at work. I said far more
was demanded of a good masseuse than the mere physical handling
of any sufferer. She must concentrate and by sheer power of will
endeavour to impose some of her own well-being upon the sick
person.</p>

<p>As I intended they should be, Monsieur Bethune and his wife
and daughter were very impressed, and the two latter watched
everything I did with great interest. To everyone's delight the
patient's pain was eased off at once and, later, he had a
splendid night's rest. I gave him more massage upon the three
succeeding days and he declared it was a long, long time since he
had felt so fit. His gratitude was quite embarrassing.</p>

<p>Then, upon his bewailing that I was only a visitor to Nice and
asking what he should do when his next attack came on, which he
was sure would happen with any cold wind, I suggested giving his
daughter some lessons. She was an intelligent, but very
plain-looking girl in the late twenties, and seemed delighted
with the idea.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Madame Bethune, many years younger than her
husband, became a patient. She was worried a lot with insomnia,
but, rather to my surprise, the massage appeared to do her as
much good as it had done her husband and she began to sleep
better straightaway.</p>

<p>I gave the daughter about a dozen lessons and at the end was
quite proud of my pupil. She was very keen about the will-power
part and, feeling very tired after each massage, was sure she
<i>was</i> imparting something of her strength to her mother. Her
mother believed so, too, and thought there was something quite
romantic about it.</p>

<p>Then, as I had been disagreeably expecting all along, came the
question of remunerating me and, one evening after I had been
dining with the family, Monsieur Bethune smilingly held out to me
a sealed and rather bulky envelope. "Just a little token of our
regard," he said, "but not that it is in any adequate way
relieving us of our obligations to you."</p>

<p>I know I got very hot, but I refused to take the proffered
envelope. "No," I said emphatically, "I don't want any reward,
and I won't take it, though I thank you very much for offering it
to me. It's been a great pleasure to me to help you."</p>

<p>Somehow I didn't think he seemed surprised, or even
disappointed, when after a few moments' hesitation he put the
envelope back in his pocket. "Then, all right," he said, "and
when you leave us, it will afford us great pleasure to present to
you some little token of our appreciation." He smiled. "I dare
say that among some of the old junk I have in my little shop I
shall be able to find some little trinket or other to please a
lady."</p>

<p>I remained in Nice about a month longer and the Bethune family
made a great fuss of me, calling at the pension almost every day
to motor me to some place of interest. Several times, too, I went
to his place of business again to watch his men at work in the
<i>atelier</i>.</p>

<p>Monsieur Bethune was very sad about his business. Although it
had not been made public yet, he had only recently sold it to an
American firm and they were to take over very shortly.</p>

<p>"I hate having to retire," he said, "but my medical man tells
me that unless I do&mdash;" he made a grimace, "&mdash;I may soon
be where there is no buying or selling of my so-loved stones." He
regarded me with obvious affection. "If I were not retiring,
Mademoiselle, I would have suggested your coming to me to train
as a saleswoman. With those beautiful hands of yours and your so
chic appearance you would make an ideal one." He smiled. "Why,
you would charm all the <i>messieurs</i> who came into my salon
and they would take anything you offered them."</p>

<p>"For some things I would have liked it very much," I said,
"but for others I would have felt I must go back to Paris." I
smiled. "You see, Monsieur, my heart is there."</p>

<p>He mistook my meaning and smiled knowingly. "Ah, that's it, is
it?" he said. "Well, he's a lucky man." He sighed again. "Youth!
What a wonderful heritage it is, but alas! none of us appreciate
its glory fully enough until it is gone!"</p>

<p>The evening before I was leaving Nice I went up to dine with
him and his family. With the meal over they all gathered round,
and with sparkling eyes, Monsieur Bethune gave me the parting
present he had spoken about.</p>

<p>When I opened the little morocco case I saw it was a brooch of
a single stone set in a big platinum claw and the stone was one
of the pigeon-blood rubies I had so much admired!</p>

<p>My eyes welled up in tears at the magnificent present, as I
know it was worth many thousands of francs.</p>

<p>When I showed it the next morning to Mr. Chapel at the pension
his eyebrows went up in surprise. "A great gift!" he exclaimed
with enthusiasm. "The gift of a king to his queen! Why, a
necklace of them would be worth a fortune in English pounds!" He
spoke warningly. "Never wear it in a crowd, Mademoiselle, though
it will be some safeguard for you that no ordinary thief will
think it is real." He laughed. "It is a jewel that, ordinarily,
would go with sable coats and a big silver Rolls Royce car."</p>

<p>The morning I arrived back in Paris was a day of bitter cold,
with dull clouds overhead and deep slush in the streets, I
thought with a shudder of some of the cold draughty studios I had
sat in, and the dread of another pneumonia loomed up large into
my mind. The young doctor had warned me very earnestly against
risking a second attack, lest the dreaded tuberculosis might
follow, as it so often did in young girls.</p>

<p>The next week I was busy moving into another little flat I had
found in Autueil. Then I thought of the card I must send round to
my former patrons notifying them that I had resumed work, but
every time I sat down to draw it up nothing eventuated. Somehow I
felt I simply could not return to my old calling. If I did, for
one thing I knew I must break with my good friend, Monsieur de
Vallon. I dared not offer to sit for his Academy again, as
although I saw no difference in my bust, I was sure he would, and
I could visualise the pained look with which he would regard me.
The thought preyed upon my mind. Added to that, I felt I had lost
confidence in myself. I dreaded the cold and, even with the
studios kept warm enough for my comfort, the going out afterwards
into the chilling air frightened me.</p>

<p>I was in this state of mind, when one afternoon, taking my
usual walk, I stopped to look in the window of Louis Manton's big
jewellery shop in the Rue de Rivoli. I knew it had a world-wide
reputation and certainly it was bigger and from the outside
looked more imposing than that of Monsieur Bethune's. Glancing
through the revolving door, the interior seemed beautifully
appointed. The window had a magnificent display, but with a
thrill of pride I noticed among the rubies there was no stone
which surpassed or even equalled mine in beauty.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I made up my mind. I would interview the proprietor
and see if he would take me on as a saleswoman. Accordingly, the
next morning, dressing myself very carefully with the best of
everything I had and wearing my ruby brooch, I walked boldly into
the big shop and asked to see Monsieur Manton. After some short
delay, as he was engaged for the moment, I was taken into his
private room and found myself in the presence of a very
smartly-dressed and youngish-looking man whom I took to be well
under forty.</p>

<p>I stated confidently upon what errand I had come and he
regarded me very intently, his eyes falling, I noticed several
times upon my ruby brooch. I told him something about myself, how
I was born in Montreal, but had lived most of my life in England
and for the last three years in France, how my father who was
dead had been an artist and how, for getting on for two years, I
had made my living as an artist's model.</p>

<p>Asked why I now wanted to give up that occupation, I explained
how I had been very ill with pneumonia, with my doctor strongly
advising me not to risk the danger of a recurrence by coming out
from the heated studios into the cold air.</p>

<p>He was most polite and I could realise from his manner that my
general appearance had certainly not made a bad impression upon
him. "It is true," he said, "that I could do with another
assistant, but in your case the great drawback is that you have
had no experience." He considered for a few moments and then
asked, "What references can you give me?"</p>

<p>"Only those from Monsieur de Vallon of the de Vallon Academy
of Art," I replied, "and some of the artists for whom I have
sat."</p>

<p>"And how far do those go back?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>"For a little longer than a year and a half," I said.</p>

<p>He shook his head frowningly. "But they would be no good to
me," he said at once, "no good at all." He spoke emphatically.
"You must understand, Mademoiselle, that in a business such as
mine I have to take the utmost precautions, and to know
everything about those I employ, even to their family histories.
Working for me, you would be hourly handling articles, small
portable articles at times of very great value. On your own or
with a confederate you would have many opportunities of robbing
me and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I hope, Monsieur," I interrupted in heat, "that I don't
look a person like that."</p>

<p>"Certainly you don't, Mademoiselle," he said smilingly. "On
the contrary, you look a very charming young lady who would be a
great asset to my establishment." He bowed gallantly. "Those
beautiful hands of yours were made to handle beautiful things and
that so shapely neck would show to great advantage any necklace
you put on to tempt my client, but&mdash;" he shrugged his
shoulders, "&mdash;as the hard-hearted man of business I take
myself to be, I could not let such things for one moment weigh
with me in the absence of proper references."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose it's quite hopeless for me," I said sadly.</p>

<p>"Quite, I'm afraid," he replied. He went on. "You see,
Mademoiselle, between us jewellers and the underworld of this
great city a battle of wits is always going on. They use every
trick and artifice to rob us and, in return, we do everything to
baulk them. They employ demoiselles almost as elegant and
attractive as you yourself, and the more appealing they are the
more we are upon our guard." He threw out his hand. "Why, not a
fortnight ago, here in this very shop, we caught red-handed a
young girl of all seeming innocence and with the face of a
Madonna trying to palm back upon us a good imitation for the
valuable diamond she had just been looking at. It was a splendid
piece of sleight-of-hand and she would have got away with it if
her imitation stone had not happened to pick up some of the
perfume from her scented fingers, and also if the assistant who
had been serving her had not, as a non-smoker, had a keen sense
of smell. As it was he became suspicious at once, and we caught
her out, so to speak, red-handed."</p>

<p>A thought seemed to strike him, and he asked, "But what first
put the idea of your getting employment in a business such as
mine?"</p>

<p>"When I was convalescing after my illness, upon the Riviera,"
I said, "a few months ago I happened to get very friendly with a
jeweller there and often went to his <i>atelier</i> to watch his
assistants at work. Then, for a service I was able to render him
and his family when they were ill&mdash;" I put my hand upon my
ruby brooch&mdash;"he gave me this as a parting present
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've been admiring it," broke in Monsieur Manton. "It is a
very fine imitation."</p>

<p>"Imitation!" I scoffed indignantly. "Why, it's a genuine
Burmah stone! I'm quite sure Monsieur Bethune would have nothing
imitation upon his premises."</p>

<p>The jeweller's eyebrows went sky-high. "Bethune!" he
exclaimed, as if in great surprise. "Fran&ccedil;ois Bethune of
the Boulevard Charlemagne in Nice?"</p>

<p>"The same," I said, and I saw the ghost of a smile steal into
Monsieur Manton's face and he looked down his nose. "Oh, these
French!" I thought. "Their minds for ever running in the same
groove," and I felt my face getting hot. However, I said quite
calmly, "Yes, and it happens I had a letter from Madame Bethune
only this very morning," and, opening my bag, I took it out and
showed it to him. I handed it across the desk. "You can read it
if you like."</p>

<p>He <i>did</i> like and read it through carefully. It was a
very short one, but warmly affectionate. She wrote how they all
missed me and that I was to remember how delighted they all would
be when, according to my promise, I came to stay with them. In a
fortnight her husband was to relinquish the business for good and
he was very upset about it. She had signed herself <i>"Always your
dear friend, Lucille Bethune."</i> Below that, Monsieur himself had
added, <i>"And you take good care, ma petite, as Monsieur
Chapel has told me he has warned you, never to wear that little
brooch we gave you when you are going to mix in a crowd. If you
lose it I shall be very angry and have to give you another
one."</i></p>

<br>
<p>"The postscript is Monsieur Bethune's," I said. "That is his
handwriting."</p>

<p>"I am quite aware of it," smiled the jeweller, handing back
the letter. "Monsieur Bethune was a great friend of my father's
and I, too, have met him. I had heard he was giving up business,
but did not know it was going to be so soon."</p>

<p>"Yes, and but for that," I said, "I should have gone as an
assistant with him. He said how much he would have liked to have
me."</p>

<p>"And that Monsieur Chapel he mentions," asked the jeweller,
"is he by any chance an Englishman, a Mr. Robert Chapel at one
time of Hatton Gardens? Ah, he is, is he? And another friend of
yours." He laughed, "And you said you had no references!"</p>

<p>He asked to look at my brooch and I took it off and handed it
to him. "A magnificent stone," was the verdict. "Not as large as
some I have seen, but in every way as lovely."</p>

<p>I thought some explanation was necessary. "And he gave it to
me," I said, "because I had been able to do him and his family a
service." I shrugged my shoulders. "Not to merit such a present
as that, but all the same I had been able to help them."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you had," he nodded smilingly, "and now I intend to
help you. Of course I shall write to Monsieur Bethune as a matter
of routine, but you can start work here at once. As you have had
no experience, to begin with I shall give you three hundred
francs a week, but if you prove a success, as I feel sure you
will, you shall soon receive more than that. I can afford to pay
my employees well."</p>

<p>And I am sure that before long they <i>did</i> realise that I
was going to be a success. Of course, at first mostly all I did
was to look on and keep an eye out for light-fingered customers
who were hoping to pick up something with no payment at all.
When, after a few weeks, I did start as a saleswoman, I was put
among the silver articles, where not so much experience was
needed and where there was less risk of my making any
mistakes.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, before I had been with Monsieur Manton for
even a month I was able to do him a great service and it was a
great feather in my cap.</p>

<p>One Monday morning, to everyone's amazement it was found there
had been a break-in during the night, down through the floor
above where a <i>costumi&egrave;re</i> carried on her business.
The thieves had made a hole obviously only big enough to admit
the very small man who had dropped down into the shop in a corner
right at the back, in the shadows. Everything had been cleverly
thought out, with a long grey sheet having been first lowered
through the hole to screen whoever had been dropped down from
lights in the shop window which were always kept burning all
night.</p>

<p>Apparently, the thieves had become frightened as they had not
managed to take much, but for all that they had got off with a
number of valuable rings which they had obtained by cutting
through the plate glass protecting the tray which contained
them.</p>

<p>Detectives swarmed all over the place, but we carried on as
usual, though with hushed voices and rather scared faces. In the
course of the morning a sudden recollection came to me and I went
at once to speak to my employer. I was told he was engaged with
one of the inspectors of the <i>S&ucirc;r&eacute;t&eacute;,</i>
but for all that I knocked boldly upon his door.</p>

<p>Bidden to enter, directly he saw who it was, he frowned, "I am
busy," he said curtly. "I cannot be disturbed."</p>

<p>"But I have something to tell you that may be very important,"
I said, and I told him quickly what I meant. About a week
previously I had been going out to lunch when I passed a car
stationary upon the other side of the road. It was a closed one
about twenty yards away and a man was sitting in the driving
seat. As I drew level with the car, I distinctly caught sight of
someone else huddled in a corner at the back with a camera in his
hands. He was taking a snap, and it had struck me at the time
that the camera was pointed towards our building. Almost the very
moment I had gone by, hearing the car start and move away, I
turned round to notice that a rug or something which had been
obscuring the back window was being pulled away.</p>

<p>"What was the man like who was using the camera?" snapped
Monsieur Manton's visitor, who was of course the inspector from
the <i>S&ucirc;r&eacute;t&eacute;.</i></p>

<p>"I didn't see his face," I replied, "as his head was bending
down, but I remember now I got the impression at the time that he
might have been a boy. He seemed so small and slight."</p>

<p>"And the man in the driving seat?" went on the inspector. "Can
you describe him?"</p>

<p>"Better than that," I smiled, "I can tell you who he is. I was
at the races at Chantilly on Saturday and his horse, La Belle
Rose, won the third race. I happened to come upon him in the
paddock directly after the race and some friends were
congratulating him and shaking his hand."</p>

<p>The inspector frowned. "But how did you come to remember his
face so well," he asked, "when, as you tell us, you had seen him
for only those few seconds as you went by the car."</p>

<p>"Because," I replied emphatically, "he reminded me so exactly
of one of the attendants in the picture gallery at the Louvre. In
fact, for a moment I thought it was he. He had the same type of
face and the same peculiar-shaped nose. The great difference was
that this man in the car, from what I could see of him sitting
down, gave me the impression of being very smartly dressed."</p>

<p>Monsieur Manton jumped to his feet and, with no comment left
the room, returning, however, in a minute or so with that
morning's copy of <i>Le Matin</i> in his hand. Re-seating
himself, he turned to the racing news and in a few moments read
out, "La Belle Rose, owned by Monsieur Jules Bernier."</p>

<p>The inspector whistled. "Mon Dieu," he exclaimed, "we know him
well at the <i>S&ucirc;r&eacute;t&eacute;.</i> He's a very shady
customer. He runs a second-rate night-club in the Rue Boisonnier
and we have had several brushes with him. He's a real bad egg."
He turned smilingly to me. "Thank you, Mademoiselle. What you
have told us may turn out to be of great value," and I left the
room feeling very pleased with myself.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon I was summoned to Monsieur Manton's room.
The inspector was there with him and they were both smiling.
Spread out upon a paper on the table were the stolen rings.</p>

<p>"Not one missing, Mademoiselle," said the inspector. "We
raided that Monsieur Bernier's flat an hour ago, and I am sure he
was the most surprised man in the world. No wonder you thought
the man with the camera was of small size and might have been a
boy. He was the jockey, Patten, who had just managed to squeeze
through the small hole they had made in the ceiling." He laughed.
"You wait until you see the newspapers tomorrow morning. They
will acclaim us messieurs of the
<i>S&ucirc;r&eacute;t&eacute;</i> of Paris as the best detectives
in the world, but, unhappily, will not ever learn we owe all our
success to the very charming Mademoiselle de Touraine. We shall
have to keep that dark to mystify those other blackguards of the
underground."</p>

<p>After that, I ranked very high in the estimation of my
employer and was gradually entrusted with the sale of the more
valuable pieces of jewellery. I have good reason to remember
always the first big sale I made. It was that of a diamond
necklace costing a hundred and fifty thousand francs or about
eighteen hundred English pounds. The buyer was an Englishman, a
Mr. Temple Fane, and he bought it for his wife who came with him.
Both of them I judged to be not far off forty, but while he was a
gentle, reserved man of charming manners, she was a very
unpleasant woman, bad tempered, and most difficult to please. She
seemed almost mental to me and was very rude and overbearing. I
could see how uncomfortable she made her husband.</p>

<p>They came several times to the shop before the purchase was
actually made, and then afterwards I was sent up to their hotel
because she complained the catch on the necklace was not
satisfactory. She was in bed with lumbago when I saw her and was
even more querulous and exacting than ever. I found there was
nothing wrong with the catch, and that the trouble was because
she had not been managing it properly.</p>

<p>Before they left to return to England&mdash;they lived in
London&mdash;Mr. Fane came into the shop by himself and gave me
the most lovely box of chocolates I had ever seen.</p>

<p>I was three years with Monsieur Manton and, though I loved my
work there, I don't think I was ever really happy or contented. I
didn't know what was wrong with me. It didn't seem to be a lover
I wanted, as I had never got over my one experience with Anton
Meynall. It had sickened me of men, and I was regarding myself
again as a naturally cold type of woman. I could have had plenty
of lovers had I wanted them, and it came to me in time that even
Monsieur Manton himself would not have been averse to some
encouragement upon my part, had I shown myself at all predisposed
that way.</p>

<p>However, I turned him and all the others down and, without
giving any offence, made them understand quite clearly that sex
was of no interest to me. Looking in a long mirror one day I
summed myself up and considered what exactly it was that
attracted men to me.</p>

<p>I knew I dressed well and had acquired the French flair of
wearing exactly what best suited me. Light blue was my favourite
colour and the other girls used to say I always looked what the
French called chic. I made the most of my good figure by going to
the best dress-makers for my costumes.</p>

<p>Certainly I was not beautiful, but I had many good points,
which taken altogether gave me a dainty appearance. My colouring
was very good and my complexion without a blemish. I always
looked clean and fresh. My face was oval-shaped, I had nice
violet-coloured eyes and my artist patrons had often told me what
a pretty mouth I had. When I smiled I showed good teeth which had
never needed any dentist's care. I was very proud of them.</p>

<p>Yes, I told the mirror ruefully, my appearance was not
unattractive, though I was not allowing it to get me anywhere. My
temperament did not incline me to matrimony and yet&mdash;what
prospect was there for a girl in my position except a good
marriage?</p>

<p>I laughed a little sadly. What a queer girl I was! Here was I
sailing under false colours with a name which did not belong to
me, and telling any amount of untruths to keep up that deception
and yet&mdash;at heart no one was more conventionally inclined
than I. I scorned the idea of becoming the mistress of any man,
however wealthy he might be, and, in little things, I was most
scrupulous in every way. I was dead honest, would never cheat
anyone of a penny and, strangely enough, I never told lies.</p>

<p>A little over six months before I left Monsieur Manton's I got
a great shock, for coming home to my flat one evening the wife of
the <i>conci&eacute;rge</i> of the building told me a man had
been round that morning making enquiries about me. He had given
her fifty francs not to let me know, but she came knocking at my
door before I had been home five minutes. The enquirer had wanted
to know if I were married or betrothed or if I went about with
any particular man friend. Indeed, she said he had been most
interested in everything she could tell him about me, declaring
many times, however, that his enquiries meant no harm to me. The
description she gave me of him was that he was young, very
respectable in appearance and looked as if he might be a clerk in
some office.</p>

<p>As can be well imagined, I was terribly upset. In fact, when I
was by myself again I literally shook with fright.</p>

<p>Who on earth could it be who was now coming after me in this
dreadful secret way? Was it that by some evil chance old Mrs. de
Touraine had heard from some traveller returning from Paris that
a Mademoiselle Marie de Touraine was living there and, knowing
she and her sister were the last of their name, the old lady was
now wanting to find out who this strange woman was?</p>

<p>Naturally very ignorant about all matters relating to the Law,
I now asked myself fearfully if, in taking Madeline's name as I
had done, I had committed some dire criminal offence for which I
could be punished and put in prison. At any rate I was sure the
position was very serious for me, as it was not for nothing money
was being spent to track me down to where I lived.</p>

<p>However, I was determined to baffle whosoever was after me
there and, within a week, had moved off to another flat in a
quiet little street off the Boulevard St. Germain, quite a
distance away. I paid a week's rental in default of any notice,
and was gone within an hour, leaving no address to where I could
be followed.</p>

<p>Then week after week went by without my learning of any more
enquiries being made about me and, gradually I became confident
that whomsoever had been the man who had called at my flat in
Passy I had successfully shaken him off. Then, about six months
later, coming home as usual one evening, to my horror I learnt
that someone had been round, asking much the same questions as
before. From the description given me, the enquirer was the same
one as before.</p>

<p>It was one of the cleaners of the building who told me this
time, and I was filled with a terrible feeling of foreboding. It
was evident someone was determinedly keeping watch upon me and
whatever they were intending to do&mdash;my guilty conscience
frightened me they would assuredly do in their own good time.</p>

<p>The very mystery added to my fears and very soon I was
realising there was going to be no peace of mind for me until I
left Paris and buried myself far away where there would be no
beginning of any track to be picked up and followed.</p>

<p>Unhappily, however, I could not do that for nearly a whole
month, as, when after a short probation Monsieur Manton had taken
me on as a permanent assistant, I had signed an agreement for
three years and the time would not expire until then. Had I been
inclined to leave him without notice, straightaway, all apart
from such shabby treatment to one who had been so kind to me,
there was another reason why I should stay on to fulfil the
contract to the end. An annual bonus of a fairly substantial
nature and amounting to five thousand francs would be due to me
then and, with little money saved, I certainly could not afford
to lose it.</p>

<p>Still, in a week or two now I should have to tell him I was
leaving and&mdash;I dreaded doing it.</p>


<hr>


<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.<br>

TAKING RISKS.</h2>

<p class="first">ONE evening about three weeks before my time
with Monsieur Manton would be up I left the Rue de Rivoli in a
very disconsolate frame of mind. I still had said nothing about
leaving, very cowardly putting off from day to day the breaking
of the news to my employer. I knew so well how annoyed he would
be, as I was now reckoned his most valued saleswoman, with most
of the big deals, particularly if it were thought some
considerable persuasion would be needed, being almost invariably
handed over to me.</p>

<p>The season, too, was now approaching when the usual crowd of
American and other wealthy visitors would be pouring into Paris
and I could not be resigning my position at a more awkward time.
All along Monsieur Manton had been so consistently kind to me
that I realised how ungrateful it would seem thus leaving him in
the lurch. I must give him a good reason, too, for going off so
abruptly to obtain a satisfactory reference from him.</p>

<p>Added to these thoughts was another one which worried me not a
little. If I changed my occupation, what new one was I going to
take up? Whatever decision I made there, it must be made quickly,
as I should have very little money behind me. As I have said
before, I had practically saved nothing, for though I received a
good salary, I had lived up to it. I had dressed well, always
priding myself that none of the other assistants dressed better.
Then I spent a lot upon amusements, worst of all undoubtedly, as
an habitual race-goer, losing many hundreds of francs at
Long-champs and Chantilly.</p>

<p>So, as can be well imagined, altogether I was feeling very
depressed and preoccupied as that evening I was making my way to
catch my usual tram home, indeed so preoccupied that I almost
walked straight into a man standing on the pavement before
me.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mademoiselle," came a pleasant, cultured voice
to break into my thoughts. "I am afraid it is too much to hope
you will remember me?"</p>

<p>I glanced up with a frown to see a well-dressed man,
apparently of about middle age, regarding me smilingly. His whole
appearance was so much in his favour that even in those first
moments of surprise it never entered into my mind that he was
some enterprising stranger trying to pick up an acquaintanceship.
Somehow, too, his face seemed vaguely familiar.</p>

<p>"But, of course, you won't," he went on with a laugh, "seeing
it must be more than two years since we last met. You were at
Monsieur Manton's here in the Rue de Rivoli then and sold me a
diamond necklace. I was with my wife. My name is Temple
Fane."</p>

<p>With a slightly heightened colour I <i>did</i> remember. He
was the customer with the unpleasant wife, and it was he who had
afterwards given me that lovely box of chocolates. I took the
hand he held out and smiled back. "Of course, I <i>do</i>
remember," I said. "Your wife was not well at the time and I went
up to the hotel to attend to her. How is she now?"</p>

<p>His face clouded. "I lost her a little over six months ago,"
he said. "Poor soul! She had a long illness and we knew she
couldn't get better." He regarded me intently. "You haven't
altered at all. You look just the same as when I first saw you."
He spoke most respectfully. "You are going home, are you? Then
may I walk a little way with you?"</p>

<p>We walked on at first chatting about nothing in particular. He
said how he had always loved Paris and thought it the most lovely
city in the world. I agreed with him, and then he went on that
with all its fascination it was a lonely place to be in by
oneself, and he was finding that so now. Instinctively I sensed
what was coming and was not a bit surprised when he asked me if I
could come out to dinner somewhere with him that evening.</p>

<p>"It would be such a kindness, Miss de Touraine," he said
earnestly. "I am here for a few days and feel so lonely."</p>

<p>For just a few moments I hesitated. As I have said I was
feeling very worried, and I would much rather have spent the
whole evening at home considering what I would have to do. Then I
thought suddenly that if I went out with him, it would at any
rate mean a nice meal, with of course the usual champagne. There
would be music and gaiety, too, and for the first time I could
pack all my troubles away. So, saying how nice it was of him to
ask me, I agreed to come.</p>

<p>He looked very pleased and flushed up like a boy. "And I'll
come and call for you in a taxi," he said. "We'll go to
Pradelli's. You get a very good meal there."</p>

<p>It was a happy evening for me and I enjoyed every moment of it
to the full. The food was delicious and the champagne drove all
my worries back into their dark holes. I knew I was as
well-dressed as any other woman there, and my ruby shone out
compellingly like a big red star against my cream velvet
gown.</p>

<p>Aware that Mr. Fane had been looking many times at the stone,
I remarked smilingly, "It's a lovely one, isn't it, a real
Burmese ruby? It was given me by a gentleman-friend of mine some
years ago when I was on the Riviera convalescing from a bad
attack of pneumonia," and then, noticing the shadow which had
fallen across my new friend's face, I added casually. "He's a
dear old man and when I first came to know him, he was in the
jewellery business himself. He gave me such an expensive present
because I had been able to do a service to him and his family. I
go to stay with him and his wife every year. They and the
principal of the Art Academy here&mdash;a Monsieur de
Vallon&mdash;" I laughed, "another old gentleman, are really the
only friends I have."</p>

<p>Mr. Fane's face had cleared. "But you lead rather a lonely
life, don't you," he asked, "with only old people for your
friends?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I do," I said, "but I've got accustomed to it." I
smiled back. "You see, I am getting an old maid now and the young
people seem too empty and frivolous for me."</p>

<p>He told me quite a lot about himself. He was upon the Board of
Management of several companies in London and his life was rather
a busy one, though of late, with no children of his own he was
finding it very monotonous. He had a house in Lowndes Square,
which was much too big for him, but he had been born in it and,
accordingly, did not get rid of it because of its associations.
His only close relation, was a sister who had married a cousin, a
one-time Colonel in the Coldstream Guards and they had no
children either. This sister was very kind to him, but he did not
see as much of her as he would have liked to, as she was very
occupied with social duties. She was a woman of tireless energy
and lately had taken up Spiritualism and was rather keen about
it.</p>

<p>In return for his confidences I told him something about
myself, with many reservations of course, and how I had no
relations at all. He frowned slightly when I told him about my
artist's model days, but commented with a smiling bow that he
could quite understand anyone wanting to paint me. He was very
interested in my career at Monsieur Manton's, remarking there,
with another smile that I ought to be wearing beautiful things
instead of selling them.</p>

<p>In parting, it was arranged I should go out with him the
following evening and I said goodbye with my brain in something
of a whirl. I should have been very simple indeed if I had not
taken in he was greatly attracted by me and my heart beat quickly
when I considered to where it might lead. I realised
instinctively that he was not the kind of man to be paying such
attentions to me, as he had been trying to make out, just as it
were only to pass the time away. Even after such a short
acquaintance the idea was forming in my mind that if I gave him
tactful and not over-forward encouragement, a real friendship
might ensue which, in the end, might lead to anything. Always of
a sanguine disposition, though I was half laughing to myself at
the idea, I could almost already see myself as the second Mrs.
Fane.</p>

<p>That night it was many hours before I could drop off to sleep,
with thought upon thought rioting through my mind.</p>

<p>To begin with I asked myself tremblingly what would marriage
with Mr. Temple Fane mean, and the answer came instantly. Why,
everything! He was of the type of perfect Englishman! He was
good-looking and, I could see, of the kindest possible nature! He
would make any normal woman happy and&mdash;he must be very well
off.</p>

<p>Then about myself. If my past could be wiped out and I were to
start life all over again I was sure I could make him a good
wife. I was presentable, I was a decent woman, and no one who had
ever known me could have ever said my disposition was not a nice
one.</p>

<p>Ah, but could my past be wiped out?&mdash;and my heart beat
uncomfortably when I considered if, under any circumstances, I
should be justified in marrying a man like Mr. Fane without first
disclosing to him the secrets of my life.</p>

<p>Nothing could wipe out the fact that I had been someone's
mistress, certainly for only a few short weeks and then under
circumstances which were not as discreditable as it would make
the bare statement seem. Still, I should not be coming to him as
I was sure he would be imagining, in the untouched maiden state.
If, however, I confessed to nothing, I was confident he would
never learn it for himself as I could judge from everything about
him how ignorant he really was about sex. He would be easy to
deceive and, with him making love to me, the part of a woman with
no experience would not be difficult to play.</p>

<p>I thought long and hard about it, but in the end satisfied my
conscience that my brief association with Anton Meynall did not
unfit me to become Mr. Fane's wife. It was a chapter of my life
finished and done with and no one would read its pages again. It
was my own personal secret and, certainly did not brand me as a
bad or unworthy woman. So much for that.</p>

<p>However, my passing myself off as Marie de Touraine was quite
a different matter, as it was not one which could not be closed
down but must now continue for the whole of my life. Still, I
reasoned I was hurting no one by my deception there and, indeed,
was myself benefiting only in a sentimental way. As old Mrs. de
Touraine had impressed upon me so strongly, had I so wished I
could have changed my name to any other in a perfectly open and
legal way. Instead, with such a favourable opportunity presenting
itself to me, I had chosen to do it secretly, but with no one
being in any way the worse by my so doing.</p>

<p>Comforting myself that it was another secret which was
nobody's business but mine I dropped off to sleep at last.</p>

<p>I went out with Mr. Fane both the next evening and the one
following. He could not have been more kind and attentive and I
was sure that by now he had quite made up his mind about me.
However, each time we went out I could see the more and more
clearly that he had had very little to do with
women&mdash;indeed, I was to learn later that his dead wife was
the only sweetheart he had ever had&mdash;and was so obviously
nervous how to approach me. I was sure it was not that he was
nervous about committing himself, but nervous only because, as a
man of his age, he was wanting a girl of mine to become his wife
and was wondering what I should say to it. He was afraid to
venture to ask me.</p>

<p>On the third day, the Sunday, after we had been to the races
at Chantilly and dined afterwards at a fashionable restaurant I
determined to bring things to a crisis. He accompanied me as
usual to the block of buildings in which my flat was situated and
then I suggested if he should come in and have a cup of
coffee.</p>

<p>I had not asked him in before and I could see how pleased he
was. Inside my little flat, which after the great spacious
restaurants he had taken me to seemed smaller even than a small
cupboard, he helped me off with my cloak. Then, upon turning
round, I saw his tie was a little bit askew. "Let me put it
right," I said, and at once proceeded to do so.</p>

<p>My face was very close to his and I knew that my bare arms
smelt nicely of some new scent I was trying, and my warm fingers
came up against his neck. It was more than the poor man, with all
his ordinary restraint, could put up with and, just as I was
putting the last finishing touch to his tie, he flushed hotly
and, laying hold of my fingers, pressed them hard against his
lips. I let him have them for a few moments and then pulled them
gently away.</p>

<p>"You're a bad boy," I smiled, "and I can see young girls are
not as safe with you as I thought."</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it," he stammered. "Your hands smelt so
delightful." His voice shook a little and he seemed most
contrite. "But you're not angry, are you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Of course, I'm not," I said. "After all," I laughed, "what is
a kiss on the hand in this country? It's only politeness, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"But it wasn't just politeness with me," he said with his
voice more unsteady than ever. "It meant far more than that,"
and, taking courage, as I intended him to from the smiling way in
which I was regarding him, he suddenly reached out and, pulling
me to him, kissed me full upon the mouth. It was a warm and
passionate kiss and by no means a short one. Then for a few
moments he stopped to lift up his head and look into my eyes
before kissing me passionately again. This time I kissed him
back.</p>

<p>"Then you'll marry me, darling," he exclaimed chokingly, "for
all that I'm such an old man?"</p>

<p>"You're not old," I reproved sharply. "You're in the very
prime of life. Yes, dear, I'll marry you," I went on in pretended
resigned tones, "as you seem to want me to." I smiled. "What else
could a decent girl do after she'd let a man kiss her the way
you've been doing?"</p>

<p>"Then we'll be married straightaway," he exclaimed
delightedly. "Where shall it be?" and he started kissing me
again. "Do you know, darling," he said, "I have loved you from
that first day I saw you nearly two and a half years ago?"</p>

<p>"Well, let me make the coffee now," I said, "and then we'll
sit down and talk everything over."</p>

<p>It was nearly two hours before he left me and then I had
almost to push him out, pointing out laughingly that the
<i>conci&eacute;rge</i> of the building had seen us come in and
my reputation would be lost if it became known I had been
entertaining a gentleman friend until the small hours of the
morning.</p>

<p>We had decided to be married at an English church in Paris in
three weeks. In the meantime he would go back home and get things
ready. We would have a ten-day honeymoon in Switzerland.</p>

<p>When at last he had left me I drew in a long breath. Only
three short weeks and I should be safe! Of whatever anyone was
suspecting me it could not be anything that would take a husband
from me and, even if he found out I had married him under a name
which was not my own, in the full tide of his passion for me I
was sure that as my husband he would forgive me. I knew the
marriage would be quite valid in any case.</p>

<p>It was very amusing when my husband-to-be, or David as I will
henceforth refer to him, bought the engagement ring the next
morning. I had told him exactly how I stood with Monsieur Manton
and he agreed with me that to buy the ring from him would be as
tactful a way as possible of breaking the news that I was leaving
him.</p>

<p>I had already picked out the ring I would like best. It was a
rather expensive one and would cost twenty-four thousand francs,
or at the then prevailing rate of exchange about &pound;300
English money. Still my fiance had said the sky was to be the
limit.</p>

<p>When he came into the shop it happened Monsieur Manton himself
had come forward to attend to him and, learning what he wanted,
had laid upon the counter a tray of our most valuable rings.
Repressing my amusement at the unfolding of the little comedy we
had arranged, I was standing only a few yards away. David just
glanced casually over them and then said, "But, if you have no
objection, Monsieur I think I'll get your Mademoiselle de
Touraine here to choose one for me. With those pretty hands of
hers she should be a good judge."</p>

<p>Monsieur Manton looked rather surprised, but beckoned to me to
approach. I pretended to consider for a few moments and then
picked up the one I had set my mind upon. I put it on my
engagement finger and held it for David to inspect. "A very good
choice, Mademoiselle," he said. "No, don't take it off. Leave it
where it is." He turned to my employer. "And the price, Monsieur?
Ah, twenty-four thousand francs! Then I'll write you a cheque at
once."</p>

<p>Monsieur Manton frowned. Of course he had forgotten David and,
with no idea who he was, it went contrary to all his business
principles to accept cheques from a perfect stranger. However,
before he had time to make any comment David went on smilingly,
"Oh, the cheque will be quite all right and, besides, the ring
will not be leaving your premises here before you have had ample
time to cash it, as Mademoiselle will be wearing it all the
time." He laughed happily. "Which is one way of telling you that
you will be losing her services in less than three weeks. She
will become then Mrs. Temple Fane," he bowed&mdash;"my wife,
Monsieur."</p>

<p>For a few moments Monsieur Manton looked the very picture of
astonishment. Then he congratulated us warmly. However he
shrugged his shoulders rather sadly. "But in one way I do so,
Monsieur Fane, with the greatest of regrets, as I am losing one
of the most efficient young ladies I have ever had."</p>

<p>After arranging to meet me for lunch, David left the shop and
my employer turned to me with a knowing smile. "Well, you've
certainly done very well for yourself, Mademoiselle," he said. "I
recall everything about Monsieur Temple Fane now. He's a friend
of Milord Rashleigh of the Embassy here and a very wealthy man.
As I expect you know, he's on the board of management of several
big companies in England."</p>

<p>I had three days with David before he went back to England and
getting leave from the Rue de Rivoli went about with him
everywhere. He wanted to buy me everything he saw in the shops
for my trousseau, but I insisted I could myself provide all I
needed. Still, I could not prevent him buying a very expensive
moleskin coat. He said I was sure to be glad of it in
Switzerland.</p>

<p>It was strange, to note the great change which had come over
him. Instead of the shy and nervous man he had been in the
preceding few days, he was now masterful and with no hesitation
about how he wanted anything done. I could so easily visualise
him as the successful man of business Monsieur Manton had told me
he was.</p>

<p>The three days having passed, he returned to England, not
intending to come back until the eve of our marriage. Looking
back in after years, I can realise what a worrying fortnight then
followed for me. So near to the wonderful time it would be for me
when I was actually his wife, I was expecting every day that
something terrible would happen, and the cup of happiness be
dashed from my lips even at the last moment.</p>

<p>Every night when I returned home I thought someone connected
with the building would come knocking at my door again and that I
should learn more enquiries had been made about me. It filled me
with apprehension and I passed broken nights.</p>

<p>However, nothing happened and upon the appointed day I was
married in the English church in the Rue de Guise. There were
only a few casual spectators present, and I was married in my
travelling dress. Monsieur de Vallon gave me away, and one of the
attaches at the British Embassy, an old friend of David's was the
best man. We left by the night express for Geneva. The train was
very crowded and, owing to the attache having very carelessly
applied for the reservation in the wagon-lit so late, we were
separated from each other on the journey.</p>

<p>Reaching our hotel the next morning, when we were at last
alone together in our room and I was hiding my nervousness by
starting at once to unpack. I received what was certainly one of
the surprises of my life. Taking me in his arms, so that we could
exchange our first wedding kiss, after we had both said how happy
we were, he went on with a sly smile, "Now I believe, darling, it
is customary for all newly-married couples to confess to each
other everything that they've done." He smiled fondly. "I am
sure, sweetheart, you have nothing to tell me, but I'm not quite
as innocent as that and I do so hope you won't be angry when
you've heard what I've got to say."</p>

<p>With my guilty conscience stirring in me at once, my mouth
went dry in apprehension and my knees shook, as I wondered if his
confession meant something he had found out about me. However, I
had not time to work myself up into a fright, as he went on
quickly, "Now, darling, don't you just imagine in your pretty
head that it was by chance only that I met you in the street that
afternoon when you had left Monsieur Manton's to go home. There
was no chance about it as I had come over to Paris on purpose to
see you and ask you to marry me."</p>

<p>I stared at him blankly, for the moment hardly able to take in
what he had said. However, realising from the affectionate way in
which he was regarding me that I had frightened myself for
nothing, as he stopped speaking I forced myself to what I was
sure must have sounded a rather nervous laugh. "I am flattered,"
I said, "but how did you know I was no longer a single girl?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that's my confession, darling," he laughed back. He spoke
very solemnly. "I knew you weren't married or even engaged,
because for many months, all unbeknown to you I had from time to
time been having enquiries made to learn all about you."</p>

<p>"Making enquiries about me!" I choked. "Where?"</p>

<p>"At your flats," he replied. "I employed an agent and he used
to follow you home from the Rue de Rivoli to find out where you
were living. Then the next day he went there and made the
enquiries I wanted, so tactfully, however, that he assured me you
would never learn from anybody that they had been made."</p>

<p>Oh, the relief I felt! So all my worries had been for nothing,
and how many broken nights I might have spared myself had I only
known!</p>

<p>David went on. "As I told you, I fell hopelessly in love with
you that very first day I saw you when we came to the Rue de
Rivoli to buy that diamond necklace and when my poor wife
died&mdash;and before that when I knew her death was only a
matter of months&mdash;you were always in my thoughts. An old
fool you may think, me, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think you an old fool," I burst out indignantly, "I
think&mdash;" but a feeling of such great thankfulness was
stirring in me that I did not finish my sentence and, instead,
put my arm round his neck and buried my face in his shoulder to
keep back the tears which would have come so easily. When he
lifted up my face to kiss me I kissed him back, and after that,
never at any time could he have had any cause to complain of my
coldness.</p>

<p>We had a very happy honeymoon, and if he were masterful in the
ways with others, with me he could not have been more gentle or
more grateful for any favours that I gave him. I often wondered
what his former wife could have been to him as he had very
inexperienced ways of making love. I thought she must have been a
very cold and unresponsive woman, and with me becoming really
very fond of him so much of our mutual happiness must have been
something of a revelation to him.</p>

<p>I was feeling very nervous, when, with the happy days of the
honeymoon over, we started back for London, in my inexperience of
all household management dreading having now to take up my
position as the wife of an important business man. I was
wondering, too, what his sister would think of me. Of course she
would be very curious, and I thought rather apprehensive as well
as to what 'the shop-girl' her brother had married was like.
David had told me she would be at the house in Lowndes Square to
welcome us, and had arranged to stay there for a few days to put
me in the way of things.</p>

<p>My ordeal commenced when we were met at Victoria Station by a
liveried chauffeur in the big Bentley car. I saw the man give me
a quick appraising look, but then was very relieved when his face
broke into a bright smile. Driving up to the house, a
smartly-dressed woman of about middle age, whom I realised
instantly was David's sister, appeared almost the moment after
the butler had let us into the hall. She, too, gave me one sharp
intent glance and, then approached quickly, kissed me warmly upon
both cheeks. She seemed a bright vivacious woman of a kind and
happy disposition.</p>

<p>"Welcome home, dear," she exclaimed heartily. "I hope you had
a pleasant crossing!" then, turning to her brother, she went on,
"Now, David, whilst you are looking at your letters&mdash;there
are a lot waiting for you&mdash;I'll show Marie over the
house."</p>

<p>She led me first into our bedroom for me to take off my things
and then, with the door closed, said laughingly. "Now, let me
have a good look at my new sister-in-law."</p>

<p>And she certainly <i>did</i> have a good look, taking me in
from top to toe. I know I was blushing furiously. "Why," she
exclaimed after a few moment's scrutiny, "you're a regular little
beauty and I can certainly teach you nothing in the way of dress.
You look a nice-natured girl, too, and David is a very lucky man
to have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>By now, however, I had quite recovered my composure and as she
hesitated broke in laughingly, "Picked me up! That's what you
were going to say, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>It was now her turn to blush. "No, no, dear," she said
sharply, "chosen was the word I was going to say." She went on
quickly. "Of course I was a little bit anxious about you, as I'm
very fond of dear old David and he really knows nothing at all
about women." She nodded viciously. "Your predecessor was a
horrid creature, a real Tartar, and it was a mercy for everyone
when she was gone."</p>

<p>I soon settled down into my new surroundings. Clara, Mrs.
Robert Hume, was kindness itself and took no end of pains to
tutor me not only in household affairs, but also into the ways of
the social life into which as David's wife I was so abruptly
thrown.</p>

<p>Approaching fifty years of age and a woman of strong and
resolute character, she was full of energy and excelled in
everything she undertook. An enthusiastic golfer, she was equally
good at tennis, she rode to hounds and was an excellent shot. A
keen race-goer, she had two good jumpers of her own and
superintended not a little of their training herself. Attending
spiritualistic seances as I already knew, was another of her
hobbies.</p>

<p>With a small flat in Earl's Court, her real home was yet in
Eastbourne where she had a big residence known as Mead's Court,
abutting right on to the Downs leading up to Beachy Head. The
house stood in its own beautiful grounds and was absurdly large
for a childless couple such as were she and her husband, but it
had been left to her by an uncle and she said the idea of
disposing of it had never entered into her mind.</p>

<p>"My husband likes company," she explained, "and, entertaining
a lot as we do, the place is really not too large for what we
want."</p>

<p>Her husband, the Colonel, was a peppery old gentleman some
fifteen years older than she was and very eccentric in many ways.
However, he thought the world of her and tolerated her
spiritualistic leanings in an amused contemptuous sort of way.
When she was having a seance at the Court, he was generally
present, always on the look-out for trickery upon the part of the
medium and hoping to catch him or her one day.</p>

<p>Clara and I soon became great friends, with her never ceasing
to express her gratitude to me for having made her brother such a
happy man. "You are making him so happy, dear," she said once,
"that if you were the ugliest and commonest girl in all the world
I would still love you."</p>

<p>In other ways, too, she said she could not possibly be more
pleased with me than she was, always declaring I was a genius for
management and was the most adaptable girl she had ever met. She
added she was very proud of me whenever, in our social world, we
went anywhere together.</p>

<p>Our house in Lowndes Square was full of beautiful things and,
when I looked round upon them sometimes, I almost choked in
emotion on the realisation that as David's wife they were all
mine. Still, in those first days of marriage when under my
sister-in-law's guidance I was taking my place in Society and
mixing with the best class of people, the fear was always with me
that someone would one day bring up my relationship with the de
Touraine family in Montreal. However, it comforted me not a
little in remembering that the de Touraines with whom I had lived
had been the last of their line and, as Madeline had often told
me, had mixed very little with other people. No one ever
<i>did</i> mention them to me and so the fear gradually died
down.</p>

<p>I often wondered if old Mrs. de Touraine were still living and
one day, passing a Canadian Shipping office in the city, I went
in and asked if they would very kindly allow me to see a recent
directory of Montreal. To my relief the name of de Touraine did
not appear in it.</p>

<p>I had been married a bare ten months when my son was born, and
David was thrilled that, in his forty-fifth year, he had become
the father of such a lovely baby. My cup of happiness seemed full
to the brim, as I was getting the more sure that now no shadow of
the past would fall across my life. However, just when the baby
was about a year old and I was expecting another one, I was to
realise with a shock that the ghosts of the past are not so
easily laid. One of my secrets came dangerously near to the
surface.</p>

<p>One morning I was sitting in my own private little
sitting-room doing some sewing when Chalmers, our very solemn
butler, came in to tell me that a man had arrived from the
registry office about the situation of chauffeur. Our
then-chauffeur was leaving us very shortly to migrate to some
relations in Australia.</p>

<p>The engaging of a chauffeur was really in my husband's
province, but I felt quite capable of dealing with it and so
ordered Chalmers to show the man in. It happened I was putting
some coal upon the fire when he entered and so did not glance
round at him until I heard the click of the closing door. Then I
turned and, to my horrified amazement, saw Anton Meynall, the man
who had so wronged me, standing gaping before me.</p>

<p>It was nearly six years since I had seen him and, though he
had aged and altered and was looking in poor health, I recognised
him instantly, and my heart bumped painfully. From the startled
expression upon his face it was obvious the recognition was
mutual and for a few moments we stood staring at each other
without saying a word. He recovered first.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> are Mrs. Temple Fane?" he gasped incredulously,
and, when I bowed icily, he exclaimed with some animation, "Well,
that's the brightest spot of news I've heard since I last saw
you." His voice shook. "It's taken a great load off my mind, as
I've often wondered if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You never need wonder anything about me," I broke in sharply,
"as I never wonder about you." I spoke with the utmost contempt.
"To me you don't exist."</p>

<p>"And that's how it should be," he nodded slowly. "You'll never
meet with a viler blackguard than I was, however long you may
live."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" I snapped, and I regarded him stonily.</p>

<p>He went on. "I know I can never atone for the wrong I did you,
though I'd do anything I could for you, even to committing a
murder if you asked me to."</p>

<p>"Then if you can talk so glibly about killing people," I said,
"why didn't you kill yourself?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No, I could never do that," he said. "My
religion wouldn't let me."</p>

<p>"Religion!" I exclaimed disgustedly. "Has a creature like you
got any religion? You, you&mdash;" but the dreadful word
blackmail flashed up before my eyes and I stopped what I was
intending to say. I thought it wisest not to infuriate him.</p>

<p>"Is your wife still keeping you," I said.</p>

<p>"And, pray, who told you she ever had been?" he asked. He
scowled. "Ah, that precious uncle of mine, of course!" He shook
his head. "No, I haven't heard of her for years, and I don't want
to either." He laughed bitterly. "As you see, I am now supporting
myself." He made a grimace. "I didn't turn out as I thought to be
a budding Michelangelo with my painting, and so took to the only
occupation I could make a bit of money by driving other people's
cars." He grinned in his old boyish way. "I think, it would
hardly do for me to take on the position here."</p>

<p>I did not think it necessary to reply to his question. "But I
will pay you for your out-of-pocket expenses in coming here," I
said, "What are they?"</p>

<p>"Fourpence," he replied with another grin. "Tuppence each way
by bus."</p>

<p>I took in again how shabby and frail he looked and, for the
first time since he had betrayed me all those years ago, a
certain feeling of pity came to me. I reached out for my bag upon
the desk and producing a &pound;5 note held it out to him. He
gave just one look at the note and his face reddened in
anger.</p>

<p>"I said fourpence," he snarled, "not &pound;5. Do you think
I'd want to blackmail you for threatening to tell people I know
you've got that pretty little mole above your right knee?" His
eyes blazed. "No, thank Heaven I've been a blackguard only where
women were concerned and in other ways still continue to behave
as much like a gentleman as I can." His voice rose. "So, keep
your &pound;5 and your four-pence as well, and be damned to you
for judging my character so badly that you offered them to me,"
and, as I put out my hand to ring the bell for Chalmers to come
to show him out, he turned and opened the door himself.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he said curtly, "and you can comfort yourself
you'll never hear of me or see me again."</p>

<p>The whole interview could have barely lasted five minutes, but
it had left me feeling as limp as a rag. Still, after that first
agonising thought of blackmail, the idea that he would ever
persecute me passed altogether out of my mind. Strangely enough,
as he had said, in some ways he would always be what the world
called a gentleman, and it was quite clear to me that he was
abidingly penitent for what he had done.</p>

<p>He had said I should never see him again, but about a year
later I <i>did</i> see him when I was upon a visit to my
sister-in-law in Eastbourne. He was driving the delivery van of a
provision store and I was sure he had seen me, too, but he turned
his eyes quickly away and passed on.</p>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br>

THE COMING OF THE STORM</h2>

<p class="first">I WAS not really worried that Anton Meynall had
found work in Eastbourne, though it was certainly rather
annoying, because I spent quite half of my time at Mead's Court.
Clara was always so very pleased to have me and it gradually
came about that she never liked to throw a party, and certainly
she threw plenty of them, without my being present to help her
in the entertaining. It suited David quite well, too, for he
loved Eastbourne every bit as much as I had come to, and was
glad of the excuse to spend long week-ends there. When, again,
business took him away from London, he said it always comforted
him to know I was in such bright and happy surroundings. As with
his brother-in-law the Colonel, he was amused at the seances,
having no belief at all in them, but regarding them as a mildly
exciting form of entertaining everyone.</p>

<p>In the main, social life in Eastbourne centred round retired
Service people and at most gatherings colonels and admirals were
very much to the fore. We had a fair sprinkling, too, of other
local retired professional men, but at week-ends the Court was an
open house to everyone, some drawn from Town itself, with
literary and theatrical circles being well represented.</p>

<p>As I have already mentioned, my sister-in-law was a great
racing enthusiast and, with my inclinations there being every bit
as strong as hers, we seldom missed a race-meeting at either
Lewes or Brighton. They were a great joy to me at the time, but
it is well the future is hidden from us, for, as it turned out,
they were to bring another dreadful crisis into my life where,
however, by good fortune more than by anything else I came
through everything unharmed. When peace at last came to me again
I was confident the dark chapters of my life were closed from the
prying eyes of the world for ever.</p>

<p>One Saturday afternoon when Clara and I were in the paddock at
Lewes together she suddenly clutched my arm in great excitement.
"Look, look, Marie," she exclaimed, "see that clever-looking dark
man with the beard, there is the great Caesar Sturm, the most
successful medium we have now in England."</p>

<p>I was as interested as she was, for everyone who dabbled ever
so slightly in spiritualism had heard something about Caesar
Sturm. Upon the right side of forty, he had recently taken London
spiritualistic circles by storm. A foreigner, he was something of
a mystery to everyone and there was no doubt he purposely
cultivated this mystery as a great asset for him. He would never
speak about himself and no one knew from what country he came.
Known to speak Hindustani, however, it was generally believed he
must be of Oriental origin. He spoke English perfectly, but with
a slight accent.</p>

<p>As a professional medium he was certainly a great success, for
at his seances he would nearly always get good and, at times,
even striking results. He charged high fees for his services and
was particular to whom he gave them. Insisting that spiritualism
was a religion to him, he would never submit to any tests,
declaring that, with hardened scoffers present, it was hopeless
to expect the dead would ever leave their spirit homes.</p>

<p>Many attempts had been made to catch him out in trickery, but
they had never met with any success. Sceptics said one reason for
that was because before starting upon any seance he would exact
from all present a solemn promise to on no account flash a torch
or bring light into the room in any way. If he had any doubt
about anyone in particular he would approach that person
personally and demand a specific assurance upon his or her word
of honour that the conditions he demanded would be religiously
observed.</p>

<p>Of course, many people had no belief in him and gave it as
their opinion that he was a fraud, but he took no notice of them.
He was evidently making plenty of money as he was always in good
request. A bachelor, he rented a very nice house in St. John's
Wood and ran an expensive car. He employed two maids and a
secretary. This latter accompanied him everywhere and acted as
his chauffeur as well.</p>

<p>This then was the man Clara was so excited about. I knew she
had been at several seances where he was the medium and wondered
now if she were going to speak to him. However, she soon settled
any doubts there.</p>

<p>"Come on, Marie," she said with enthusiasm. "You've never met
a medium of his importance before and I'll introduce him to you.
He's very expensive, but I really feel I must get him to give us
a seance or two."</p>

<p>Waiting her opportunity to catch him alone, she buttonholed
him and, mentioning where they had met before, introduced him to
me. At close quarters he was certainly not undistinguished
looking, with his big piercing eyes and neatly pointed black
beard. He wore his hair rather long. He stared so long and hard
at me from behind his strong and slightly tinted glasses that I
began to feel quite embarrassed.</p>

<p>"A beautiful little racecourse, this, Mrs. Temple Fane," he
said in a rich deep voice, waving his arm round the encircling
hills, unusually pretty for a course in England. "In this country
the accommodation for the betting crowd seems always to be the
main theme, but in France, for instance, the authorities cater
for lovers of the beautiful as well."</p>

<p>"And I am sure my sister-in-law will agree with you there,"
broke in Clara smilingly, "as she is always so enthusiastic about
Longchamps and Chantilly."</p>

<p>Mr. Sturm's eyes which had never left my face were more
piercing than ever. "Ah! then you have lived in France and know
Paris?" he exclaimed animatedly. He bowed gallantly. "The first
moment I saw you I thought you had something of the tone of that
beautiful city about you!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I lived there for several years," I replied, and he at
once proceeded to draw me into a discussion about the many
glories of Paris and its surroundings.</p>

<p>Not wanting, however, to monopolise all the conversation with
him and seeing some friends I knew, I excused myself and went
off, leaving Clara to talk to him. For some reason which I could
not explain I was feeling rather annoyed at the bold and familiar
way in which he had been regarding me.</p>

<p>When, a few minutes later Clara left him to rejoin me, she
announced with some pride that we had prevailed upon him to come
down to Mead's Court upon the following Thursday week and,
staying over until the Sunday, giving a seance both on the
Thursday and Friday nights.</p>

<p>"And I shall have to pay him sixty guineas," she sighed, "but
I'm sure it'll be worth it. We'll have the same people at both
the seances, so that they can give him a good try-out." She
laughed. "And he was so extraordinarily interested in you, Marie,
that it's evident you've made quite a conquest of him at once. He
wanted to know all about you, whom you were before you married
David, how many children you'd got and where you lived."</p>

<p>Fond as I was of Clara, her gossiping ways always annoyed me,
and I was really angry now when she went on to say she had told
him I had been a Mademoiselle de Touraine, descended from the
royal house of Navarre.</p>

<p>"But you shouldn't have told him that," I said crossly. "He'll
only be thinking what a lot of snobs we are."</p>

<p>"No, he won't," she laughed. "I could see he was greatly
impressed. He said anyone would know at once you were an
aristocrat as you were so dainty and such a beautiful-looking
woman." She nodded merrily. "But you be careful, Marie dear, as
he's got something of a bad reputation with his conquest of us
poor women. That's one of the weaknesses and there's been quite a
lot of scandal about him."</p>

<p>"Well, he'll make no conquest of me," I scoffed, "as I wasn't
at all taken with him. I didn't like his manner. It's too oily
and familiar for me. I wouldn't trust him a yard."</p>

<p>Clara considered, "And you may be right, dear," she said
slowly. "I think I know what you mean. When he was staring so
hard at you just now it came to me that he was not a man I should
care to have as my enemy. I should say he'd be horribly bitter
and spiteful to anyone who had offended him." She laughed. "Never
mind&mdash;it's only as a medium that we have to consider
him."</p>

<p>It happened David was upon the Continent on business and would
probably be away for three weeks. So, in his absence, I had
brought the children and their two nurses to the Court. In a way
I was glad David would not be present for the s&eacute;ances, as
they would have only bored him. Both s&eacute;ances were to be
preceded by a dinner party. Only twelve guests were to be invited
and in the days which followed, Clara gave a lot of thought about
whom to pick as guests.</p>

<p>The first two to be invited were Dr. Frank Burton and his
attractive young wife. A decidedly clever man in his early
thirties, the doctor had a good private practice in Eastbourne as
well as being the surgeon attached to the police. His house was
the next one to Mead's Court and Colonel Hume was a patient of
his. Always excellent company, we were very disappointed the
doctor said he could not come, as it happened a medical congress
was meeting in Eastbourne that week and he had engagements upon
both nights. However, his wife was delighted to come and that was
a great load off Clara's mind, as Mrs. Burton was an accomplished
pianist and would take on the music during the
s&eacute;ances.</p>

<p>The next two chosen were Admiral Peacock and his wife. The
Admiral was a merry old soul and accepted at once. "And I shall
have a nice little job for that medium chap," he laughed, "which
will fairly test him out. I heard last week that that butler of
mine who went off with my old silver two years ago has just died,
and if this medium can raise up his spirit I shall be greatly
obliged, as the rascal can then tell us what he did with the
forks and spoons. You remember he denied having taken them, but
I'm quite certain he had, though what became of them was never
found out."</p>

<p>"I'm ashamed of you, Admiral," said Clara in mock reproof, "If
Caesar Sturm knew of the base uses to which you are intending to
put his spiritualistic powers he would have a thousand fits.
Remember, he says his calling up the spirits of the dead should
be regarded as solemnly as any religious ceremony in a
church."</p>

<p>An elderly maiden lady, a Miss Hunt had been next asked to
come. An old friend of Clara's she said she had never been to a
s&eacute;ance before, but stated she was open to believe
anything. She was hoping both to see and hear a much beloved
sister who had been dead for many years. "But directly he
speaks," she said plaintively, "I shall know if it is really she,
as she always lisped slightly."</p>

<p>Another guest was to be Professor Rattery. Up to a few years
ago he had filled the Chair of Physical Science at a University.
Rattery, too, had never been to a s&eacute;ance and was an
aggressive sceptic about the whole thing, giving it as his
opinion that men like Caesar Sturm were out and out frauds who
should be prosecuted by the authorities, or shot privately by
some public-spirited individual who had courage enough to take
the risk of being found out.</p>

<p>Then came old Major Button who had spent many years of service
in India, and in his time been a noted slayer of man-eating
tigers. Just recently had written a very successful book about
his exploits. He was a bluff light-hearted old gentleman and a
great favourite with everyone.</p>

<p>A half-believer in the mysteries of the Occult World, he
admitted he had seen some wonderful and quite unexplainable
things done in India, but, he would add, only by men who denied
themselves everything and lived lives of great austerity. Not by
those of the type of Caesar Sturm who was known to smoke
expensive cigars, drink plenty of whiskies and sodas and ride
about in big motor cars. The moment he set eyes upon the man he
said he would be able to determine at once whether or not he was
a humbug.</p>

<p>The only really interested guests-to-be were an old retired
judge and his wife and two Varsity girls from Cambridge. The
judge said he was quite prepared to sentence Caesar Sturm to ten
years penal servitude without going through the formality of a
trial, while the girls were pretty and flippant, looking forward
to enjoy a good dinner and have a good laugh afterwards. They
both hoped Clara would put them to sit next to a good-looking
young man when the darkness of the seance was on.</p>

<p>"A nice lot to be going to sit under Caesar Sturm," sighed
Clara despondently, "and I told him that, though some of those
present would not be actual believers, still they would be
favourably inclined that way."</p>

<p>"Well, whatever happens," I said, "they won't be rude to him,
if only for your sake."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure about that," she frowned! "You don't know
Navy people and it's old Admiral Peacock that I'm most afraid of.
He swears dreadfully at times. He's only a grown-up child in some
ways and if he doesn't hear anything about that previous butler
who stole his silver spoons, it's quite likely he may start
swearing at Mr. Sturm. Those sailor people are so blunt and
forthright in what they say."</p>

<p>"But don't worry," I laughed. "They'll all be so full up with
champagne when the s&eacute;ance starts that they'll be quite
amiably disposed. If the waiting in the dark is at all long I
shouldn't be at all surprised if the Admiral didn't drop off to
sleep. I don't think I've ever known him come here of an evening
without having a bit of a snooze when no one's looking and he's
dropped out of the general conversation."</p>

<p>On the Sunday before the Thursday when Caesar Sturm was due to
arrive he rang up Clara, asking who were going to be present at
the stance. "I always like to have some idea of what kind of
people I am going to meet, as when it's known I'm coming anywhere
certain enemies of mine often try to wangle an invitation to make
themselves nuisances and put me out of my stride."</p>

<p>"They're all local people and quite harmless," said Clara. "I
think only two of us will have ever taken part in a s&eacute;ance
before," and she proceeded to rattle off the names. Whereupon
Sturm seemed quite satisfied and rang off.</p>

<p>"But I shouldn't be at all surprised," Clara laughed to me,
"that as I've told him they are all local people, he'll have a
few enquiries made about them in the town, to see if he can find
out anything which he'll use to make them imagine they are
hobnobbing with spirits when the lights are turned out."</p>

<p>"You know, Clara," I commented, "somehow it always strikes me
that you are not much of a believer yourself."</p>

<p>Clara smiled. "I am and I am not. Of course I know the whole
thing can so easily lend itself to trickery and yet&mdash;yet
I've been present at s&eacute;ances when quite genuine people
have most solemnly declared that they have seen the spirits of
those who have passed on. I can't get over that."</p>

<p>"But have you seen the spirits, too?" I asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "No, I've seen nothing. No one I have
concentrated upon had condescended to appear." She laughed.
"Still, I've always found s&eacute;ances very interesting, as I
expect you know, they give you a delicious creepy feeling that
something exciting may happen any moment."</p>

<p>The eventful Thursday arrived and an hour or so before dinner
most of those who had been invited were having cocktails in the
lounge when Caesar Sturm and his secretary were announced. The
latter was a well-groomed young fellow about seven or eight and
twenty. He had a pleasant humorous face with shrewd grey eyes,
and it struck me at once that he did not at all look the type of
man who would have spiritualistic leanings. Both he and his
employee took a quick glance round upon all of us gathered
there.</p>

<p>Sturm shook hands with Clara and Colonel Hume and then,
ignoring most rudely I thought the former who was starting to
introduce him to those standing near her, made a bee-line right
across the lounge to speak to me. "Ah! the very charming little
Mrs. Temple Fane!" he exclaimed with animation, and he held out
his hand to me with so knowing and familiar a look that I was
sure everyone would think we were old friends. Of course I had to
take the proffered hand, but my annoyance mounted when he
proceeded to squeeze mine tightly and was so obviously in no
hurry to let it go. I felt myself getting hot at his impudence
and, finally dragging my hand away, turned half round and took no
notice of what he went on to say to me.</p>

<p>With some apparent reluctance he went back to Clara, but
evidently had no idea I had meant to snub him, as a few moments
later he brought his secretary up to me to be introduced.</p>

<p>"Mr. Eric Danvers," he exclaimed with his voice booming
through the lounge, "another admirer all ready to fall at your
feet, Eric," he went on, "this is Mrs. Temple Fane, that little
friend I've spoken to you about whom I met at Lewes races the
other day."</p>

<p>"Friend!" I exclaimed loudly, and determined to let everyone
in the lounge know upon what footing we stood. "Why, that was the
first time I'd met you."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course it was," he said in great good humour.
He looked amused. "But then I make friends easily when the
friendship promises to be a pleasant one."</p>

<p>Clara saw he was annoying me and came up to lead him away
then, seeing I was going to take no notice of him as I had turned
quickly to speak to Admiral Peacock, the secretary took himself
off after his employer.</p>

<p>"A regular bounder that Sturm," commented Admiral Peacock who
was standing near me, "and I'd like to bet any money he's been
spotting on the drive down. He just reeks of spirits. You can
smell him miles away."</p>

<p>And Clara, too, remarked upon his smelling so strongly of
drink when later she sort of apologised to me for the man's
persistence. "I am sorry, dear," she said, "but that's the worst
of men like Caesar Sturm when they get up in the world. They
imagine every pretty girl they see is going to fall in love with
them at once." She laughed. "Still, I think you let him see
plainly enough that there's going to be none of that with you and
I don't expect he'll bother you any more."</p>

<p>However, he did start annoying me again when he came into the
lounge just before dinner was due to be announced. I saw his eyes
wandering round and, picking me out at once, he came over and
plumped himself down next to me upon the settee where I was
sitting.</p>

<p>"Well, young lady," he asked, "and have you been backing any
good winners lately. I myself have been having a
rather&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But with no hesitation I rose sharply to my feet. "But I
mustn't monopolise you, Mr. Sturm," I said coldly. "There are
others here who want to speak with you." I beckoned to old Miss
Hunt who was interestedly watching us from only a few yards away.
"Miss Hunt," I called out smilingly, "Mr. Caesar Sturm would like
to have a little chat with you," and I motioned her to the seat I
had just vacated.</p>

<p>There was no doubt now that Sturm had taken the snub, and his
eyes blazed with such a horrid look that for the moment I felt
really frightened. Clara had been noting everything from the
other end of the lounge and, happening to meet me in the corridor
just before the dinner gong sounded, said she didn't think she
had seen such concentrated venom in anyone's face before.</p>

<p>"You keep out of his way, dear," she enjoined. "He's a most
unpleasant type of man and I'll never have him here again." She
laughed. "Now here's something prophetic and you see if I don't
turn out to be right. Miss Hunt buttonholed that secretary just
now and I heard her telling him all about her sister. Of course,
he'll pass it on to Caesar Sturm and it's pretty certain one
spirit will arrive tonight. Won't the poor old thing be
pleased?"</p>

<p>During dinner it was evident to me that I was well and truly
in the medium's bad books, as I saw him glancing several times in
my direction and each time he scowled. Colonel Hume was most
annoyed with him, not for that, as I don't suppose he noticed it,
but because Sturm's manner was so generally bumptious and
overbearing, letting everyone see he thought himself a most
important man. Another thing. While he hardly addressed a word to
any of the men guests, during nearly the whole course of the meal
he was talking animatedly across the table to the two Cambridge
girls and Dr. Burton's pretty young wife. He seemed to take no
notice at all of his host or hostess. Some of the stories he
told, too, were rather verging on the coarse side, and I could
see an angry scowl upon Colonel Hume's face. I knew him to be
most particular about what stories were told in front of our
sex.</p>

<p>"But I'm not in my best form with my stories tonight," he said
presently, "or I'd be remembering some more funny ones." He
looked troubled. "I'm rather worried, because upon Friday and
Saturday nights there'll be no one looking after my house in
Town. My two maids are sisters and they will be away up North at
their mother's funeral."</p>

<p>"And you're afraid of burglars, Mr. Sturm?" asked Miss Hunt a
little nervous at addressing the great man.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am rather," nodded Sturm.</p>

<p>"Then have you anything valuable they could take?" grunted old
Major Button.</p>

<p>"Not valuable that they could sell again," replied Sturm, "but
there are the records of every s&eacute;ance I have presided
over, my diaries and a few presents given me when I was staying
at a monastery in Tibet."</p>

<p>"Charms, eh?" queried the Major, looking amused.</p>

<p>Sturm hesitated a few moments. "Well, I suppose you might call
some of them that. One is a small crystal specially dedicated to
me in a solemn ceremony by the monks. At ordinary times it
sparkles and glistens, but when I am in any danger it loses all
its lustre and goes almost black."</p>

<p>"And you really do put trust in it?" scoffed the Major.</p>

<p>Sturm nodded. "Yes, I do now," he replied very solemnly,
"though I admit I didn't when it was first given me. Two years
ago when I was in India I was about to take a certain long
journey by train when the crystal suddenly went black. I
hesitated quite a long while about postponing the journey as it
was a very important one, but I eventually did." He looked very
grave. "That night the train I should have travelled upon met
with a dreadful accident. It ran off the line when going at a
high speed and a number of the passengers were killed." He
shrugged his shoulders. "Had I gone I might have been among
them."</p>

<p>A short silence followed and then the Admiral asked dryly,
"And did you happen to look at the crystal before you started to
come down here this afternoon?"</p>

<p>Sturm shook his head. "No, I was in a hurry and forgot to see
if there was any warning of possible danger coming." He looked
round laughingly. "So I must be sure and give you good measure at
the s&eacute;ance tonight, or I may, perhaps, be getting a bullet
in my head before I go back to Town on Sunday. One can make a lot
of enemies in my calling, you know, unbelievers and others who
are jealous of what I can do. I have always to be upon the
lookout."</p>

<p>"A clever rogue," whispered the Admiral who had taken me in to
dinner, "and I don't believe a word he says. Still, we may get
some fun out of him."</p>

<p>The meal over, we all adjourned to the library where the
s&eacute;ance was to be held. Sturm appeared very hopeful and was
sure it was going to be a very successful one. It was a heavy
sultry night, with thunder about, and he said it would all help
to draw the spirits from their actual homes. Privately, though
for another reason, I thought things were propitious, too, as if
any of the guests were at all spiritualistically inclined, as I
had told Clara, from the amount of champagne which had been drunk
at dinner, they would certainly be in a happy enough frame of
mind to believe anything. Rather to everyone's surprise, Sturm
suddenly announced that his secretary would not be present at the
stance. "To assure you all," he said laughingly, "that there
shall be no collusion between us." Eric Danvers looked rather
puzzled. The decision was evidently a surprise to him, too, and
it seemed he couldn't understand it.</p>

<p>We were all seated at a round table, with each one of us
clasping tightly to the hand of our neighbour on either side. All
our hands were resting upon the edge of the table and fully
exposed to view. I was seated between Clara and the old judge. As
I have mentioned, Mrs. Burton, was to be in charge of the piano,
and, during the whole continuance of the seance, was to play soft
and gentle music.</p>

<p>Before switching off the lights, Sturm proceeded to issue the
usual instructions. On no account, even for one moment, were we
to break the circle of our clasped hands, or all contact with the
spirits would be prevented. No one but him was to speak and we
were all to keep perfectly still. We were not to cough or fidget,
and were to breathe as quietly as possible. Religiously keeping
to these orders, we were to concentrate our thoughts hard upon
someone whom we had once known and whom had now passed into the
spirit world.</p>

<p>"Please all of you take in," he finished impressively, "that
it is not I who summons the spirits to appear. The call comes
direct from you, and my part is only to open the doors of the
spirit world so that they may be freed to come down among
us."</p>

<p>The lights were switched off and in the darkness a dead, deep
silence filled the room, until very softly there came up upon the
air the strains of Chopin's <i>March Fun&egrave;bre,</i> and the
glorious melody stirred even sceptical me to anticipatory
awe.</p>

<p>Minute after minute went by. A delicious Nocturne followed the
Funeral March and, soothed by the music in some mysterious way,
my thoughts began wandering back upon my life. I recalled the
dreadful little house in Rocker Street and the big lonely one
upon the moor. I saw my beloved master, the two Hindu servants,
Sakao the wolf and the big fierce-eyed Alsatians. Then&mdash;but
the voice of Sturm broke in at last.</p>

<p>"I hear rustling sounds!" he hissed sharply. "I feel a draught
of chilling air! A spirit has come among us! It is hovering near!
Concentrate, concentrate, or it may leave us again!"</p>

<p>He stopped speaking and for a long minute only the soft and
opiate strains of a cradle lullaby were heard. Sceptics though
they might be, all seated at the table seemed to be holding in
their breaths, and my heart beat painfully.</p>

<p>Then came Sturm's voice in an excited whisper. "I see a thick
cloud before me! It is taking shape! It is that of a woman! I see
her plainly! She is elderly and has grey ringlets and her hair is
parted in the middle."</p>

<p>Miss Hunt's voice broke in, weak and all shaking but we could
all hear her. "It is Emma," she choked, "the sister I loved so
dearly!"</p>

<p>"Hush! Hush!" came very sternly from Sturm. "Her face is drawn
and pale, but she looks happy. She is glancing round among us!
Her lips are moving! She is trying to speak! No, no, she is
fading away! She has gone!"</p>

<p>Poor old Miss Hunt started to cry softly, but upon a sharp
"Hush!" from Sturm she pulled herself together and, save for the
soft music, the room was in silence again. Notwithstanding what
Clara had told me of the old lady's talk with the secretary, my
scepticism was in part waning, as the description of the dead
sister was so exact. Miss Hunt had once shown me her photograph.
She <i>did</i> wear old-fashioned ringlets and her hair
<i>was</i> parted in the middle! I could not help feeling
impressed.</p>

<p>For a long time nothing more happened, except that I thought I
had been a true prophet, as I was almost certain I could hear
Admiral Peacock starting to snore quietly. Then, just as I was
expecting Sturm to declare the stance was finished and he could
do no more for us that night, he suddenly warned us hissingly
that another spirit had come into the room. For minute after
minute, however, he left us in suspense until he began excitedly
to describe this new spirit in minute detail.</p>

<p>He said it was that of a tall and turbaned man who was dark
and swarthy and had big, flashing eyes. He was moustached and
bearded and was wearing gold earrings. To my great disappointment
that was all Sturm could tell us before the form of the spirit
faded gradually away.</p>

<p>"Damn," swore Major Button quite audibly, betrayed into speech
in his amazement, "but that was devilishly like old Abdul Khan,
my head beater in Johore. He must have&mdash;" but Sturm in some
anger called for silence, and the s&eacute;ance went on.</p>

<p>Another silence followed, but not nearly so long this time and
then, all in a few short moments I was plunged into feelings of
horror and consternation.</p>

<p>In intense but subdued excitement Sturm announced the coming
of another spirit and, when the cloud of mist had taken shape, he
went on in his hissing whisper that it was that of an old man of
commanding and martial appearance.</p>

<p>"He looks as if he had been a soldier once," he breathed. "He
has white hair and a closely clipped white moustache. He has big
eyes and big bushy brows and there is a scar on one side of his
forehead. His face is very sad and his hair is damp and matted
over his forehead."</p>

<p>Oh, how amazed I was! I struggled to fight against it, but I
was sure the spirit was that of my old master, Colonel Jasper,
whom he was describing! The scar upon the forehead made it so
certain! His hair, too, was damp and matted, because it must have
been so when he had been drowned that dreadful night in the Bay
of Biscay! I felt I wanted to be sick.</p>

<p>Sturm went on sibilantly. "He is looking round upon everyone
in this room! Oh, his gaze is fixed upon someone here! His lips
move! He is saying something but his speech is so faint that I
cannot catch what it is. Let whoever here has called him,
concentrate, concentrate, so that his voice may gather strength!
Ah, he is going! He is fading away! He is gone!"</p>

<p>I almost choked in fright. It must be that we had really been
in the presence of a spirit from the dead! I had thought of my
poor old master and my thoughts had brought him to me! It seemed
incredible and yet&mdash;but Sturm was whispering again and the
whispering was more intense than ever.</p>

<p>"Another spirit is here," he warned us, "and is that of a
young man! He has come so quickly that he must be linked up with
that last one! They have travelled together from the spirit
world! Oh, I can see him so plainly now! He looks white and
terrified and there is blood upon his face! There is blood, too,
upon his hands which are clutching to his throat as if he is
trying to protect it! His eyes are horror-struck, as if he knows
he is facing some dreadful form of death! His head rocks to and
fro! Oh, he is fading, fading! He has passed from my sight!"</p>

<p>I choked back a scream. The medium had been describing the man
whom Sakao, the wolf, had killed that dreadful morning by the
house upon the moor, and he described him exactly as I had seen
him in those awful last moments of his life. My heart seemed to
almost stop beating, a black mist rose up before my eyes and I
had just time to tell Clara what was happening to me when
everything went blank. I heard afterwards that Clara had had the
s&eacute;ance stopped at once and the lights turned on. I was
carried into another room and laid upon a sofa. When I came to I
was put to bed with a big dose of brandy and two hot-water
bags.</p>

<p>It can be well imagined in what a dreadful state of turmoil my
poor brain was. One thing, I was a sceptic no longer. What I had
believed to be absolutely incredible was undoubtedly true. Caesar
Sturm, sensual and drunken beast though he was, did possess the
power of calling up spirits from the dead. It must be so, as
there could have been no trickery about it. Then a terrible
thought struck me and made my blood run cold. What if he raised
the spirit of Colonel Jasper again at the next seance and my old
master actually spoke and called to me by name? What if&mdash;but
no, I would not be present at the next s&eacute;ance. I would
keep away as far as possible from Sturm, the medium, as I was
intending to keep away from Sturm, the man!</p>

<p>One consolation I did have, I told myself. Neither Sturm
himself nor any of the others who had been present at the
s&eacute;ance would be aware that those two particular spirits
had come from my thinking about them and had anything to do with
me.</p>

<p>It was hours and hours before I finally dropped off to sleep,
but when I did I slept deeply until the morning and was very
pleased with myself that, upon Clara's coming in to see what sort
of night I had had, I was feeling really quite well. She told me
it was generally considered the s&eacute;ance had been quite a
success and everyone was looking forward to the one that
evening.</p>

<p>Intending to face the music boldly and not let Sturm, above
all people, know how upset I still was, I insisted upon getting
up for breakfast. Sturm came into the meal, but we just exchanged
a curt good morning and I did not join in any conversation he was
taking part. I noticed he gave me not a few quick glances and was
rather puzzled; they seemed not only spiteful but also, in some
subtle way, triumphant ones, as if he thought he had succeeded in
paying me out for my snubbing him the previous evening.</p>

<p>I didn't see him again before lunch, but heard later he had
been in the billiards-room with Eric Danvers and, greatly to
Colonel Hume's annoyance when he learnt about it, had made the
butler bring him in a large bottle of champagne soon after they
had started their games.</p>

<p>At lunch I was puzzled again by the amused and, I thought,
almost sneering looks with which he kept regarding me. However,
soon after the meal was over, the mystery there was cleared up in
a horrible and ghastly manner, and all in a few moments I found
myself in as desperate a position as I have ever been, before or
after, in all my life.</p>

<p>Sturm caught me alone and told me he knew I had once been a
servant girl known as Polly Wiggs!</p>

<p>In the Court grounds, at the bottom of the garden there was a
narrow lane running between two tall privet hedges, parallel with
the road outside, and with a five-barred gate opening out on to
it. Sheltered from the winds in every direction, the lane was a
favourite place of mine, and I used often to sit in a small
summerhouse there and either sew or read. Everything was so
peaceful and I used to enjoy listening to the birds.</p>

<p>So, not very long after lunch, still feeling very upset by the
s&eacute;ance of the previous night, I took myself off to the
summerhouse, quite sure then I should be left by myself and not
be bothered with having to talk to anyone. I had heard it
mentioned casually at lunch that Sturm and his secretary were
going for a long drive over the Downs and would not be back until
evening. So I was confident there would be no annoyance for me
from that quarter.</p>

<p>However, I had badly miscalculated there, as Sturm, waiting
outside for Danvers who had gone round to the garage to fetch the
car, happened to catch sight of me entering the lane and
immediately proceeded to follow after me. The first I knew of
anyone being near me was when, just approaching the summerhouse,
I heard footsteps behind me and turning quickly to see who it
was, to my dismay I saw it was Sturm. He came up in quick
purposeful strides and my heart beat uncomfortably when I noted
the sneering smile with which he was regarding me.</p>

<p>"Here, young woman," he said sharply. "I want to have a good
talk with you on the quiet before I leave here on Sunday and
you've got to arrange it somehow"&mdash;he leered
horribly&mdash;"even if it means you coming into my room at night
when everyone else has gone to bed." He laughed scoffingly. "No,
no, you can't put on any of your grand airs with me, as if I
choose I can be as dangerous as a bomb to you." He looked round
to make sure there was no one near and went on quickly. "The
other day at Lewes you were recognised by a friend of mine who
knew you years ago, and you were then"&mdash;for a long moment he
held my eyes with his&mdash;"a little servant girl to a Colonel
Jasper who was living in Devonshire upon Dartmoor."</p>

<p>I stood as if thunderstruck. It had all come so suddenly and
his words were striking at me like a dreadful blow. I could not
breathe and I knew my face must have gone white as death.</p>

<p>He regarded me exultingly. "Ah, I can see that's hit you," he
exclaimed with gleaming eyes. "A bit sudden, isn't it? But it
makes you realise how I've got you so completely in my power,
doesn't it?" He went on sneeringly, "You were no Marie de
Touraine then, descended from the great Kings of Navarre! You
were just plain little Polly Wiggs, as I say, a servant in that
house upon the moor!"</p>

<p>I could not speak. My tongue was cleaving to the roof of my
mouth. All my world was tumbling about me and the worst I had so
dreaded had happened at last.</p>

<p>He dropped his voice to conversational tones. "It's quite
simple how I found out all about you," he said. "You will
remember that stormy night when you were at Colonel Jasper's and
a holiday-maker had got lost and came knocking upon the old man's
door. Well, that holiday-maker was the friend of mine who
recognised you at Lewes races the other day, and he told me that
Colonel Jasper, after he and his nigger servant had searched him
for a pistol, gave him something to eat and a bed." His arm shot
out accusingly. "And it was you who waited upon them at the
meal&mdash;yes! you, the little slavey, known then as Polly
Wiggs," and he paused for a long moment to let his words sink
in.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the numbness of my poor brain was passing off
and I was beginning to think again, and think hard, too. In spite
of the terror I was in, memory after memory was forcing itself
into my mind&mdash;until suddenly a great light came.</p>

<p>Oh, what a fool I was and how easily I had been taken in! I
saw everything so clearly now! No spirits had been raised from
the dead the previous night, and no vision of Colonel Jasper or
the man whom Sakao, the wolf, had killed had come into the room!
All that this wretch now standing before me had made out had been
revealed to him in the s&eacute;ance, he had known before, as he
had been the lost holiday-maker himself. He&mdash;but my fury at
having been so deceived overwhelmed all my prudence and my fears
and, not realising the danger I was bringing upon myself, I burst
out fiercely, "And you were the holiday-maker himself, you
swindling cheat! You were no grand-sounding Caesar Sturm then,
but just a common Whitechapel street-bookmaker who had been put
in prison once for breaking into a house." My anger rose. "Your
real name, you blackguard, is Todhunter Bellamy! Yes, and you
were the companion of that man the wolf killed, that morning when
you had both been giving poison to our dogs! Oh, you wretch!"</p>

<p>There was no doubt that I had returned him a stunning blow, as
his jaw dropped, his eyes opened very widely, and for a few
moments he looked the very picture of consternation.</p>

<p>However, he pulled himself together quickly. "Then you admit,"
he snarled, "that you were Polly Wiggs? You don't deny that?"</p>

<p>Too late I realised that I had fallen into the pit I had dug
myself, but my anger was still strong and it sharpened my wits.
"You fool, you poor fool," I retorted sharply, "Polly Wiggs was
the name of affection Colonel Jasper had given me. It came out of
a book we had both read."</p>

<p>But the man was a fighter, too, and he rapped out like bullets
from a gun, "That's a lie, a silly lie if ever there was one!"
His eyes glared venomously. "But I have more against you than
that. As well as enquiries about you last week in Devonshire, I
made plenty in Paris as well. Your sister-in-law told me when you
were married. From there I traced you to the shop in the Rue de
Rivoli and, before that, to your life as an artist's model in the
nude"&mdash;his eyes gloated&mdash;"in the nude, mind you, and
that would be a nice thing for your husband to hear about,
wouldn't it?" He pretended to look amused. "I understand Mr.
Temple Fane is very prim and proper in all his ideas about women
and I don't fancy he'll much relish the disclosure of his
charming little wife having been mauled about upon such a grand
scale before he married her. What do you think about it, eh?"</p>

<p>I regarded him scornfully, but he went on leeringly, "Ah, you
were a gay young woman then, weren't you with plenty of lovers
coming to your flat? I've got the names of several of them
written down at home, in case I have to show the list to your
husband." He smiled a horrid smile. "Still, I don't think it'll
come to that. You've been a devilish sharp girl to have impressed
so cleverly upon everyone as you have done up to now, and I'm
sure you'll quickly see upon which side your bread is buttered
and join in a sensible partnership with me."</p>

<p>Still&mdash;I made no comment, and he changed to an
ingratiating tone. "Come, come, it seems we both have something
against each other, and so it won't pay either of us to quarrel.
I know when to hold my tongue and besides, I really feel very
sorry for you at being found out. Still, business is business,
and it'll be most useful for me to have for a friend a young
woman who's got a husband as wealthy as yours." The horrid smile
came again. "Don't worry! I won't be hard on you. I'm never hard
on pretty girls and&mdash;" but we heard Danver's voice shouting
for him and he turned to go. "Think it over," he commanded
sharply, "and I'm certain we'll see eye to eye." He gave me a
last menacing look. "But you make no mistake, young lady. Find
that opportunity for us to discuss things together, here on my
return at quarter past six or else"&mdash;he nodded
viciously&mdash;"you'll see how nasty I can make myself. I swear
I'll go to your husband and tell how he has married an impostor
and a bad woman at that. Under French laws I don't think the
marriage was a legal one."</p>

<p>With a mocking wave of his hand he started to run quickly
away, in his haste not noticing that his big silver cigarette
case had fallen from his pocket on to the ground.</p>

<p>I sat down upon the garden seat outside the summer-house and,
covering over my face with my hands, began to sob bitterly. What
I had so dreaded had happened and the happy little world about me
was falling into pieces! Everything seemed hopeless! I could do
nothing!</p>

<p>Then rage as well as grief possessed me, and hardly a minute
could have passed before I began to start to pull myself
together. I would never give in to him, I told myself. Far
rather, I would tell my husband everything and throw myself upon
his mercy. But the first thing now was not to let anyone learn I
had been crying. I must get indoors as quickly as possible
without anyone seeing me, and bathe my face.</p>

<p>I was proceeding to mop my eyes with my handkerchief when,
hearing a sound behind me, I turned sharply to see a man, whom I
recognised instantly as Anton Meynall, striding up towards me. I
gasped in mingled fright and astonishment as he came quickly to
my side.</p>

<p>"Marie. Mrs. Fane," he said hoarsely, "what are you crying
about?"</p>

<p>"Go away," I cried angrily. "Get out of this, You've no
business here, you know you're trespassing."</p>

<p>But he stood his ground. "I was passing slowly here in my
van," he said, "and I heard loud voices in this lane. I stopped
to listen and recognised yours. Through the hedge I saw that man
with the black beard and he seemed to be threatening you about
something. Was he?"</p>

<p>"Go way," I reiterated. "It's no business of yours. Go away
and leave me alone." More tears began to well up, and so that he
should not see them, I sprang to my feet and started to move
away. Then in a sudden paroxysm of rage and fear I turned to face
him again. "You said once," I choked, "you would commit a murder
for me if I asked."</p>

<p>"And I would, too," he nodded. He smiled grimly. "The offer
still holds good."</p>

<p>I shot out my arm in the direction he must have seen Sturm go.
"Then murder that fiend with the black beard," I cried wildly.
"You are right. He was threatening me."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He calls himself Caesar Sturm, but that's not his real name.
He is a spiritualist and is staying here at the Court to hold
some s&eacute;ances. He leaves again on Sunday." I was calmer now
and spoke less passionately.</p>

<p>"What's he threatening you about?"</p>

<p>My voice shook. "He's intending to blackmail me over something
I've never done. I'm to meet him here at a quarter past six. He
says he has been to Paris and found out I was a woman of evil
life before I married and"&mdash;but for a moment I stopped
speaking before bursting out&mdash;"My God, my God, perhaps he
found out about you and me and is going to tell my husband!"</p>

<p>"But he shall never tell him," said Anton savagely. "I'll see
to that. I'll fix him, and I won't be caught doing it, either.
Don't you worry," and before I could stop him he went back along
the way he must have come, to the gate at the end of the
lane.</p>

<p>I dried my eyes and making myself look as usual as possible
went back towards the house. I was hoping to slip unseen into my
room, but to my dismay I ran into Clara in the corridor and,
linking her arm in mine, she asked me to come into her room as
she had something to tell me.</p>

<p>I knew quite well that from my tear-stained face she must have
seen I had been crying, but to my relief and surprise she made no
remark about it. She drew me into her room and closed the door
behind us. Then she rapped out sharply, "Marie, directly that man
Sturm gets back from his motor ride I am ordering him to leave
the Court at once. Cook has been up to tell me that just before
lunch he caught little Betty in the corridor and started kissing
her. She struggled, but the beast tried to drag her into his
bedroom. The servants are furious and Cook says none of them will
wait upon him any more!"</p>

<p>For the moment I forgot my own trouble in my surprise, and
stood open-mouthed before her. "Yes," she went on, "Robert is so
angry that I've had great difficulty in persuading him to let me
deal with the brute. He wanted to take a horse-whip to him." She
shrugged her shoulders. "The trouble is Sturm had been drinking,
but that's no excuse. He's got to go and he shall go. I shall
tell him that the moment he enters the house. I've ordered Benson
to go into his room now and pack his suitcase, so that there'll
be no delay." She was quite fierce. "So that's that."</p>

<p>Suddenly then, her whole expression altered and, linking her
arm in mine again, she drew me over to a sofa and we sat down
together.</p>

<p>"Now, Marie dear," she said gravely, "we are real friends
aren't we, you and I? Yes, of course we are! And you would trust
me, just the same as I always trust you&mdash;in anything and
everything?" She regarded me with the utmost affection. "Then
tell me what you've been crying about? When you were crossing the
lawn just now I saw you from the window and, even from the way
you walked, I knew something was upsetting you. So, tell me what
it is, dear?"</p>

<p>My tears were still very near the surface, but I replied
carelessly, "Oh, nothing much. Clara, I've just got a
headache&mdash;that is all."</p>

<p>She shook her head unbelievingly, "But that's not trusting me,
dear," she said. "You are not speaking the truth now. It happened
that I was by my window, too, about twenty minutes ago when you
went into the privet lane and I saw Caesar Sturm hovering about
the front door. Tell me truthfully&mdash;did he come after you?
If he did, then I am sure it's he who's been upsetting you."</p>

<p>I tried in vain to keep back my tears, but knew they would
come and, as Clara drew me to her, I buried my face into her and
sobbed quietly. "You poor child," she said. "Have your cry out
and then tell me what's wrong. I'm certain it's that beast who's
been making you cry, but, thank goodness, you need never see him
again."</p>

<p>Oh, I was so thankful for that brief respite! I thought hard
what I should tell her. Of course, now she must learn one of my
two secrets and it didn't take me long to decide which one to
tell her. It was going to be dreadful to have to confess about
Anton Meynall, but I was sure that telling her about him would
not be anything like as bad as telling her about my lowly origin
and how I had been deceiving everyone then, including her so
dearly-beloved brother, David.</p>

<p>As a woman herself, and a broad-minded one at that, I was sure
she would condone my one moral lapse with Anton much more readily
than she would forgive my deceit about my name and origin.</p>

<p>With her coming from one of the best families in the land and
saturated as she had been all her life in the prejudices of the
so-called 'better classes,' it was possible she might never
forgive my imposture then. Every time she looked at my children,
instead of regarding them, as she did now, as the little
aristocrats descended from the Kings of Navarre&mdash;visions
might come up to her of their grandfather, the common animal
keeper, and their grandmother, the one-time uneducated little
general servant.</p>

<p>Her voice broke into my thoughts. "Now, darling," she said,
"you just tell me everything." She regarded me with great
intentness. "First of all, had you ever met that Caesar Sturm
before I introduced him to you at the races?"</p>

<p>I hated telling her an untruth, but felt there was no help for
it. "No, no," I cried, "and when he came up to speak to me he
didn't try to make out he had ever seen me before that afternoon.
He said it was a friend of his who had recognised me then, and
this man, he says, declares he saw me years ago in Paris,
when"&mdash;my voice trembled&mdash;"I was making my living as an
artist's model in the nude."</p>

<p>"And that is all he has against you, Marie?" she asked slowly.
"Don't be afraid, dear. Tell me truthfully. You won't find me a
hard judge." She sighed. "I was young and passionate myself once
and, if they knew all about me, lots of people would say that I
haven't always been a good girl."</p>

<p>I hesitated. I knew I must take the plunge, but dreaded doing
so. Noting my hesitation, she smiled a sad smile, and, with a
shrug of her shoulders went on, "Then, I suppose I'll have to
help you to tell me your story."</p>

<p>She spoke with the utmost kindness. "Now, with you as David's
wife, dear, and me as his sister, we must regard each other with
the greatest possible affection"&mdash;she nodded, "as I thank
Heaven we do. Not only that, but with the coming of your babies
we are bound together by a much greater tie, as there is now a
bond of blood between us." She laughed. "So, as this is the time
for confessions, to show my trust in you, I'll give you one of
mine, one I have given before to no one except my mother, not
even to my husband or dear old David."</p>

<p>She went on in matter-of-fact tones. "Yes, it may help to give
you courage to keep back nothing of your trouble when I tell
you"&mdash;she paused a long moment to regard me
smilingly&mdash;"that I made a bad slip myself once and, as an
unmarried girl, had a baby before I was seventeen." She sighed.
"What do you think of that?"</p>

<p>I knew I gasped. She had said it all so casually, as if it
were a matter of small importance which might have happened, as a
matter of course to any girl.</p>

<p>"No, we were not even engaged, the baby's father and I," she
went on calmly, "and I don't think we were even really in love.
It was just a boy and girl affair and we had only known each
other a few days." She shrugged her shoulders resignedly. "He was
passionate and so was I. I was curious, as well, and it just
happened. That was all."</p>

<p>"But the father, Clara," I exclaimed. "He&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never learnt anything about it," she smiled. "He was a
midshipman in the Navy, and his ship was off to the China Station
before I had any suspicion that anything was wrong. I didn't
panic, but told my dear mother at once and she took it grandly.
She said there was to be no scandal, and so took me abroad for my
baby to be born in Switzerland."</p>

<p>She laughed at my horrified face. "Oh, yes, the father is
still alive! He's an elderly, pot-bellied Rear-Admiral now, with
a whole tribe of grown-up sons and daughters. I met him at a
dinner party last year and he appeared to have quite forgotten
everything." She made a grimace. "So, I didn't think it worth
while to jog his memory, and please, dear, don't ever jog mine by
bringing it up again."</p>

<p>She spoke frowningly. "Now, Marie, tell me all the hold this
man Sturm has over you."</p>

<p>"But, as far as I can make out, he really has no hold at all
upon me," I exclaimed. "I'm sure he's making everything up, as he
brought nothing definite against me, but he says that, before I
married David, he has a lot of evidence I was leading a dissolute
life."</p>

<p>"No one who gave one glance at you," snapped Clara, "would
believe that. You are not a woman of that type."</p>

<p>"But he suspects something," I went on chokingly. "As last
week he went over to Paris to make enquiries about me, of course
only to try to find out something so that he could blackmail me.
You had told him at Lewes when I had been married in Paris, and
from the English Church he traced me back to the Rue de Rivoli
and then, before that, to my artist's model days. He made out he
had found out a lot of bad things about me and got them all
written down on a paper and in a diary he's got locked up in his
safe at home. He hadn't time to tell me anything more then as we
heard Mr. Danvers shouting for him and he went off, daring me not
to find an opportunity to have a long talk with him before he
left here on Sunday even if I had to have him in my bedroom when
everyone else was asleep."</p>

<p>"The brute!" scowled Clara. "But did he say why he had been
taking all this up against you. Did he ask you for any
money?"</p>

<p>"Not definitely," I replied, "but he leered horribly how nice
it was for him to have a woman-friend whose husband had such a
lot of money, particularly when the woman had got a pretty
face."</p>

<p>Clara regarded me with a stern, intent look. "But tell me
frankly, Marie," she said and she spoke very slowly, "if Sturm
has found out everything about you there is to be found
out&mdash;is there anything in your life you would not like David
to know?"</p>

<p>I nodded miserably and, hesitating no longer, poured out the
whole story of my association with Anton Meynall, keeping very
little back. "But I never loved him," I said tearfully. "It was
only in a mad moment after the music and champagne that I forgot
my decency and let myself go."</p>

<p>Clara was sympathy itself. "I understand, dear," she said
gently. "When our emotions are stirred we women are weak as
water, and, with the opportunity coming, so often we don't seem
to be able to defend ourselves. You didn't have a baby? No! Then
you were fortunate. Now, tell me who was the man?"</p>

<p>"His name is Anton Meynall," I said. "His uncle is Turner
Meynall, a Royal Academician now."</p>

<p>"I've heard of him," she said. "He had two pictures hung in
the Academy last year. And this Anton&mdash;have you seen him
since?"</p>

<p>"Yes, about eighteen months ago," I told her. I had to smile.
"He applied for the situation with us as chauffeur," and I went
on to relate all about the interview and how angry Anton had been
at my offering him the &pound;5 note.</p>

<p>She was amused, too. "And, if it could only be broadcast," she
said, "what a lesson it would be to every girl that if they must
go wrong&mdash;then, every time, let it be with a gentleman."</p>

<p>She became serious. "Now, when I have my little talk with the
wretch when he comes back from his drive this afternoon, I don't
think I'll say anything about you. I shall tell him simply he's
being sent off because of his attempted assault upon Betty this
morning. I shall make out the matter is most serious as her
father says he is going to the police and if he does it'll bring
a horrible scandal upon us all at the Court." She nodded
viciously. "I'll frighten him and he'll be wanting to get off as
quickly as possible."</p>

<p>She was a great comfort and I felt a hundred per cent better.
"And I don't think," I said, "that he can really have found out
anything about Anton, or he'd have brought up his name at
once."</p>

<p>"Of course he would," agreed Clara. She nodded. "If he did
hear something about you, he's certainly not been able to link it
up with any particular man. Don't you worry. He'll never dare
approach David, and this scandal here will have made him so
frightened for himself that you'll never hear anything more of
him."</p>

<p>Considering all I had been through, I spent quite a happy
afternoon in the nursery with the children. Mrs. Robinson, the
Vicar's wife and her sister arrived unexpectedly and, both ardent
amateur photographers, took quite a number of snaps of them.
Indeed, they did not desist until the light was getting too poor.
Just as they were getting ready to leave Clara appeared, and it
was she who took them downstairs to see them off from the front
door.</p>

<p>Coming back upstairs, she took me into her room. She looked
very grim and stern. "Well, this afternoon I've been phoning all
round," she said, "putting all the dinner-party off. I've told
them Sturm is not feeling well and going back to Town at once.
Now, I'm going to tell him. He's just come back, as I saw Mr.
Danvers driving the car round to the garage, but before speaking
to Sturm I thought I'd first come up and reassure you that your
name is not going to be dragged in. I tell you I shan't mention
you."</p>

<p>"You are very sweet to me," I said. "I feel a different woman
since I've spoken to you." I kissed her cheek. "But Clara, dear,
aren't you hating to have to tell him he's to go off at
once?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit," she replied. "In fact, knowing what a beast he's
been to you, I shall rather enjoy it." She turned to leave the
room and then went on laughingly, "And, perhaps, it's a good
thing for him he's going off, as old Major Button is furious with
him and told me over the phone just now that he was going to play
havoc with his constitution when he saw him again tonight. From
the description Sturm gave him of the Johore beater at the
s&eacute;ance, the old chap really believed he had called up his
spirits from the dead. Now he remembered there was a photo of
this beater in his book 'Tiger Hunting' which was published last
season, and he swears Sturm must have got hold of the book and
seen it there. I tell you he is furious about it and, quite as
likely as not, he might have brought his gun with him tonight and
given Sturm the fright of his life."</p>

<p>We were both laughing at what she had told me, when suddenly
the door opened sharply and Gertrude, one of the parlourmaids
burst in.</p>

<p>"Mistress, Mistress," she cried with a face as white as death,
"George wants you to come at once. He says Mr. Sturm has met with
a fearful accident in the privet lane and is lying on the ground
there, with his face all covered in blood. George is quite
certain he is dead."</p>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br>

THE BATTLE OPENS</h2>

<p class="first">A DREADFUL shiver ran down my spine and I
gasped for breath. I knew it was no accident that had happened.
Anton Meynall had killed him deliberately, but I was the real
murderer as he had only done it because, in my wild rage, I had
implored him to. Oh, how terrible it seemed that I was bringing
such tragedies into people's lives and&mdash;</p>

<p>But my eyes happened to fall upon the clock on the mantelshelf
and, after perhaps two seconds of dazed surprise, I gave a start
and gasped again, this time, however, in relief.</p>

<p>It could not be Anton who had shot him! I had told Anton I
would arrange for Sturm to meet me by the summerhouse at a
quarter past six and now&mdash;it was barely twenty-five minutes
past five! Oh, Heaven, then it might really have been an accident
after all!</p>

<p>I glanced wonderingly at Clara to see how she was taking it.
Her face was pale but singularly composed, though it seemed to me
that long moments passed before she spoke.</p>

<p>"You haven't told anyone but me, Gertrude?" she asked
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"No, Mistress," replied the frightened girl. "I've come
straight up to you at once. George has not told anyone either. He
said you must be the first one to know. He's waiting for you now
by the back kitchen-door."</p>

<p>"All right," snapped Clara, "and you wait here until I come
back, so that you can't tell anyone either," and, with a curt nod
to me, she hastened from the room.</p>

<p>As can be well imagined, the waiting which followed was agony
to me. Much as I was relieved that so-called Sturm could threaten
me no more and that it could not be Anton who had killed him, I
was now most fearful as to where the enquiries about his death
might lead. With my imagination leaping from one stepping-stone
to another, I was shuddering that, unless it did turn out clearly
to be an accident, in groping for some reason for his murder, the
police might somehow stumble upon what he had found out about
me.</p>

<p>With my poor brain in its then numb and bewildered state I was
regarding all detectives as supermen who could pick up tracks and
trails where none actually existed and, from sheer intuition
alone, run any criminal to earth.</p>

<p>As it happened, only the previous week Colonel Hume had met
Sir Basil Bartley, the Chief Constable of Sussex out at lunch
somewhere and had come home with some extraordinary story. Sir
Basil had told him about a wonderful young detective called
Gilbert Larose who had come lately to Scotland Yard. This new
master in the detection of crime was supposed to be gifted with
an extra sense, so much so that it was said that, when a murder
had been committed, he could put himself in the murderer's place
and travel back by the exact way the criminal had come. It was
believed by some of his admirers, too, that he could reason
backwards as quickly as other people reasoned forwards, with his
imagination reaching out like tentacles and drawing to him
discoveries of which no one else would have ever dreamt.</p>

<p>So, although now I was so thankful that my enemy was dead, I
was yet filled with a dark foreboding that his death by no means
meant peace and security for me.</p>

<p>It was longer than an hour before Clara came back and then,
dismissing the parlourmaid with a curt nod, she turned to me,
looking very troubled, "Yes, he's dead," she said, "and it's a
terrible thing to have happened. It'll mean a dreadful scandal
for us here, though to you and me it may seem a veritable act of
God. He was hit with something in one of his eyes and must have
been killed instantly. The police think it was an accident from a
stray bullet from one of some boys who were said to have been
after rabbits in the quarry just across the road this afternoon.
Still, there's so much blood about that Dr. Burton says nothing
is certain until he's made the post mortem. He says it might even
have been a stone from a big catapult that pierced his eye."</p>

<p>She went on to tell me that, after George had taken her to
where the body was lying, she had immediately sent him to find
his master and waited there until he came. He had told her to get
Dr. Burton whom he had just seen passing in his car and who would
therefore certainly be at home.</p>

<p>She had caught the doctor who had come back with her at once
and, after one glance at the body had run indoors and called up
the police. The Superintendent had come himself with two
plainclothes men, and two policemen with the ambulance. After the
usual photographs which had been taken with flash-lights, the
body had been carried away, and Dr. Burton was to make the post
mortem the first thing in the morning. The inquest would follow
in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"Of course," she said, "the police could get no footmarks of
anyone who had been in the lane today as the ground is much too
hard."</p>

<p>"And I suppose now," I choked, "there will be detectives
arriving to ask us all sorts of questions."</p>

<p>Clara shrugged her shoulders. "Well, we must put up with it,
dear. It can't be helped. At any rate, as far as you are
concerned his death is a great mercy, as he can persecute you no
more." She regarded me intently. "From the clotting of the blood
Dr. Burton says he could only have been dead about ten minutes
before George found him, and that means he must have gone
straight into the privet lane the moment he got home from his
drive in the car." She spoke very slowly. "If I did not
implicitly believe every word you have told me, Marie, I should
almost be thinking he was expecting to find you waiting there to
meet him."</p>

<p>"No, no, Clara," I exclaimed warmly, a little bit annoyed that
the idea had ever entered into her head, "I think he must have
gone back there to look for the cigarette case he had lost," and
I told her how I had seen it lying upon the ground after he had
gone.</p>

<p>"Then, of course, that was it," she said. She looked a little
bit uncomfortable. "No, dear, it wasn't in my mind that you had
told him you would be there, but I was thinking he might have
been believing he had given you such a shock that you would be
still hiding yourself away from everyone to recover from
it"&mdash;she nodded&mdash;"so that no one should see you had
been crying." She drew me to her and kissed me on the forehead.
"No, Marie, I know you have told me nothing but the exact
truth."</p>

<p>Her demonstration of affection so touched me that I took a
sudden resolution. "But I haven't been as open with you as I
should," I said miserably, and I am sure I looked as guilty as I
felt. "I have told you nothing but the truth, but I have not told
you all of it. Anton Meynall did come to me to apply for the
situation as chauffeur, but that is not the last I have seen of
him. I have seen him several times since, as he is driving a
grocer's delivery van here in Eastbourne. Still, I had not spoken
to him again until this afternoon and then"&mdash;my voice
shook&mdash;"I asked him to kill that wretch Sturm for me," and I
went on to tell her everything which had happened after Anton had
appeared so unexpectedly in the privet lane.</p>

<p>"But as Dr. Burton is sure Sturm must have been killed before
a quarter past five," I said, "and Anton was not likely to be at
the summerhouse until a quarter past six&mdash;it could not
possibly have been he who had anything to do with the
killing."</p>

<p>"Of course it couldn't have been," agreed Clara at once. "So
you can put that altogether out of your mind." She smiled. "If
Anton <i>did</i> go into the lane about six, he'd have been
greatly astonished at what he saw was going on there, as the
police would hardly have finished with their flash-lights and
have taken the body away by then."</p>

<p>She comforted me quite a lot and in a few moments I was
feeling much more hopeful again. Then she said very seriously,
"But, Marie, there's one trouble we shall have to deal with." She
held my eyes with hers. "Have you thought what it is?"</p>

<p>I hesitated. "You mean that diary of his and those papers
about me which he said he'd got locked up in his safe at home?" I
was feeling most uncomfortable again. "But I was hoping that was
all bluff and that he'd only made it up to frighten me."</p>

<p>"It may have been," she nodded, "but all the same I don't
think we ought to run more risks than we can help. If the police
take it into their heads to go back into his private affairs to
see if he'd got any enemies, they are certain to go through any
papers he left and if they find your name in them they may ask
you questions which will be very awkward for you to answer."</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders. "But there's nothing I can do to
prevent it," I said. "If they <i>do</i> come questioning me about
everything that's happened to me in my life&mdash;surely I shall
be quite justified in refusing to discuss them? They'll know I
couldn't have had anything to do with the shooting, as I never
left the nursery all the afternoon and there are four witnesses
to prove it, the Vicar's wife and her sister and the nurses."</p>

<p>"And they certainly can't get behind that," agreed Clara. She
hesitated for a few moments. "But it'll be better, dear, if you
have to make no mystery about anything and it happens there is a
way to save you from that." She went on quickly. "You remember
what Sturm told us at dinner last night about his house having no
one to look after it from this evening until Sunday. Well, do you
feel equal to running up to Town tomorrow and taking any papers
he's got about you from his safe?" She thrust her hand into the
pocket of her cardigan and with some triumph drew out a bunch of
keys. "See, here are all his keys!"</p>

<p>"But, but," I asked very astonished, "how did you get
them?"</p>

<p>"I took them out of his pocket," she nodded, "after I'd sent
George running off his find his master. I thought of them at
once."</p>

<p>"Oh, how splendid of you to think of them," I exclaimed
warmly. I was quite excited. "Yes, yes, of course, I'll go. All
the servants here know I've been talking about going up to Town
to see how those decorators are getting on in Lowndes Square. So
they won't think there's anything extraordinary about it." A
thought struck me, "But what about the police here?" I asked.
"Won't the Superintendent want me here, in case they want to ask
any questions?"</p>

<p>"Not if he's already spoken to you," she said. "He's with the
servants now, getting a list of all who were in the house about
the time Sturm was killed and finding out if any of them heard a
rifle shot, but he says there'll be no thorough questioning of
anyone until after the inquest tomorrow and it is known
definitely how he died. Now you wait in the nursery and I'll go
and bring him up so that he can speak to you and the nurses all
together."</p>

<p>In a very few minutes she came back with the Superintendent
and introduced him to us. He was very polite, and I told him how
we had all been in the nursery, along with our two visitors all
the afternoon.</p>

<p>"And none of you heard the report of a rifle being fired?" he
asked, taking in the two nurses with his questioning. The girls
shook their heads and I said, "I hardly think we should have
taken any notice of it if we had, though one of the windows was
open all the time. The cars and motor-cycles make such a noise
going by in the road that we are quite accustomed to them."</p>

<p>He seemed satisfied and went off as quickly as he had come,
while back in Clara's room she and I proceeded to discuss my
journey on the morrow. "And I'll leave very early," I said, "to
get to Town before the traffic rush, and, perhaps, be back here
before lunch."</p>

<p>"The earlier the better," she said, "so that I can put the
keys in the bedroom, as if he was accustomed to leave them there.
The Superintendent has had his room locked up and taken the key
away with him, but I have a duplicate one and so there'll be no
difficulty then. Oh, do you know where Cedar Road is in St.
John's Wood?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I do," I nodded, "but I shall want to know what
the number is."</p>

<p>"I'll get that out of Eric Danvers tonight at dinner," she
said. "Of course, the Superintendent wants him to remain here
until after the inquest tomorrow and, he says, perhaps even
longer than that."</p>

<p>We were a small party at dinner that night, Clara, the
Colonel, Eric Danvers and myself. Upon closer acquaintanceship,
the secretary showed himself a most pleasant companion, and
several times it struck me what a nice face he'd got. It was not
only that it was good-looking and kind, but it was a clever one
as well, and I told myself the young fellow deserved much more of
life than to have been hanging about a swindler such as the
so-called Caesar Sturm had been. With the servants waiting upon
us, no reference was made to the dreadful tragedy which had taken
place, but when the meal was over and we had all adjourned to the
lounge for the usual coffee Clara opened her questioning at once
by asking Danvers if his late employer had had a nice house in
St. John's Wood.</p>

<p>"Yes, quite a nice one," he replied, "but to my thinking it
was spoilt when he had the outside painted a flaming red. It made
it the most conspicuous house in the whole road, like a Fire
Brigade Station, I told him."</p>

<p>Clara flashed me a quick glance. She had got all the
information she wanted without asking for it. Painted in that way
it would be easy for me to pick it out. She turned again to
Danvers and asked hesitatingly, "Is it painful for you, Mr.
Danvers, to talk about your late employer?"</p>

<p>The secretary seemed amused, "Not a bit," he replied. "Why
should it be? I've known him for only a few months and we were
just employer and employee. We were not friends. He didn't
particularly like me, and I certainly didn't like him. In fact,
at times I was very ashamed of him, as when this morning he
started kissing that little maid of yours. I told him afterwards
about it and said we should get kicked out of the house. He was
furious and threatened to give me the sack."</p>

<p>"Then you don't mind my asking you some questions about him?"
said Clara.</p>

<p>Danvers shook his head. "Now he is dead it can't hurt him, and
besides, a lot of discreditable things about him are bound to
become public property in the course of the next few days."</p>

<p>"Then were Caesar Sturm his real names?" asked Clara.</p>

<p>Danvers laughed. "No, neither of them were. He must have
chosen Caesar for the Christian one, because he thought it gave
him importance." He nodded. "The police have known for some time
who he really was and, though he was quite unaware of it, have
been keeping watch upon him."</p>

<p>"Did you know it," asked Clara.</p>

<p>Danvers only nodded and being obviously disinclined to discuss
the matter further then, Clara did not press him. Instead, she
asked, from what country Sturm came.</p>

<p>Danvers laughed again. "From here in England," he said. "He
was an out-and-out Cockney. That trace of foreign accent he used
to drop into was part of his stock-in-trade. He always argued
that mystery was what the public wanted and so he gave them as
much as he could of it."</p>

<p>"But his dark skin&mdash;" began Clara very astonished.</p>

<p>"Was artificial tan," smiled Danvers. "He had big bottles of
it at home and put it on every morning."</p>

<p>"But he must have lived in India," she said, "if what he told
us was the truth."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he had, but I believe only for a few months. Still,
he'd read up a lot about it from a number of books he'd got. He
was an educated man and very well informed. Theosophy was one of
his hobbies and he made good use of his studies there."</p>

<p>"Had he ever married, do you know," asked Clara.</p>

<p>Danvers looked amused again! "Not that I know of, and I don't
think so. He was always chasing the other sex, but it seemed to
be a different one every time."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about his people," asked Clara, "his
relations, I mean."</p>

<p>Danvers shook his head. "I don't know if he's got any. I told
the Superintendent that a little while ago when he asked me with
whom he should communicate to let them know what had happened to
him." He spoke emphatically. "You see, Mrs. Hume, though I've
been for about three months now employed by him, he's never told
me anything of his private life. He was very secretive and kept
everyone from me. From nine to six were my ordinary hours and,
unless I was on some special job for him, out of them I was
supposed to know nothing of what was going on."</p>

<p>"Did you do much secretarial work for him?" asked Colonel
Hume.</p>

<p>"Quite a bit arranging the s&eacute;ances," said Danvers. "He
had worked up a good connection there. Besides that and attending
to the car, I was general factotum, errand-boy and sometimes
private detective. Every now and then I was sent to make private
enquiries about different people, for what reason I often never
knew. I had to prepare reports for him and then, as far as I was
concerned the matter generally ended."</p>

<p>"He told us," fibbed Clara, "that he himself went to Paris
last week."</p>

<p>"Oh, did he?" exclaimed Danvers who didn't seem much
interested. "I expect he had friends there."</p>

<p>Clara spoke casually. "But is it really true that his house
has been left without anyone in it this week end?"</p>

<p>Danvers nodded. "And the only reason I can think of to have
made him mention that was to make out how important his literary
work was." He laughed. "The champagne he'd drunk had loosened his
tongue."</p>

<p>"But did he really think his writing was very important?"
asked Colonel Hume.</p>

<p>"Hardly, I should say from what I've typed for him," said
Danvers. "It's been mostly a record of the s&eacute;ances he's
held, with the names of the people who were there. He was always
particular about that, because it said it helped him a lot if he
happened to meet the same people at s&eacute;ances again."</p>

<p>"And was his work as a medium," said the Colonel, "as really a
religion to him as he made out."</p>

<p>Danvers shook his head. "No, it was just a way of making money
that was all. He considered himself as a sort of public
entertainer who earned every penny he got."</p>

<p>Clara appeared to be very shocked. "Then don't you think it a
very wicked thing for him to have imposed upon people in the way
he did?"</p>

<p>"He didn't think so," smiled Danvers. "He's often said it was
the people at the s&eacute;ances who imposed upon themselves.
Sometimes he was astonished at what they declared they saw."</p>

<p>"Then, being the kind of man you tell us he was," frowned the
Colonel, "he must have often resorted to trickery at the seances
he held?"</p>

<p>Danvers shook his head. "No, very seldom, sir. He wouldn't run
the risk of being found out." He spoke earnestly. "You see, it
takes a very shrewd and clever man to be the successful medium
Caesar Sturm had become. He was a very good judge of character
and could realise at once when it wouldn't be safe to step one
hair's-breadth over the line. He never attempted any tricks, as
you call them, when there were any professional men present.
Then, a good actor, he would work up the excitement and, as he
said, let the s&eacute;ance take care of itself. Nearly always
there would be at least one person present, nearly always a lady
and generally an elderly one at that, whose emotions were so
stirred that she would be thinking she really did see what she
wanted to."</p>

<p>"And what tricks did he do," asked the Colonel, "when he did
go, as you call it, over the line&mdash;make chairs move about
and the table go up and down."</p>

<p>"No, nothing as clumsy as that," laughed Danvers, "but he was
a good ventriloquist, at any rate good enough to make some people
imagine there was a strange voice floating over the room."</p>

<p>"And that spirit of Major Button's beater he called up last
night," said Clara, "was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All due to you, Mrs. Hume," laughed Danvers. "You had told
him the Major was the well-known tiger killer and he guessed that
being well-known he must have written a book about it. So he sent
me to the library of the British Museum and I found the book and
told him about the photograph and you saw he made use of it at
the s&eacute;ance."</p>

<p>"But come now, Mr. Danvers," frowned Colonel Hume, "don't you
think it very dishonourable for him to have imposed upon us like
that, and dishonourable, too, on your part to have been helping
to do it?"</p>

<p>Danvers shook his head. "Not exactly, sir," he said. "As with
Sturm I regarded the s&eacute;ances as a sort of entertainment,
just as are fortune-telling with the cards and conjuring tricks.
Nearly all people have a love of mystery and the marvellousness
and derive a real pleasure in being knowingly deceived. When, for
instance, they go to an exhibition of conjuring they expect to be
taken in by the skill of the conjurer in his sleight-of-hand and
clever tricks. Then, the greater their deception the greater they
are pleased. So, I take it, with all people of ordinary
intelligence and powers of reasoning, the calling up of the
spirits of the dead is&mdash;or should be&mdash;regarded in the
same light, as a form of entertainment only. Their common-sense
must tell them it can't really be done."</p>

<p>Of course Colonel Hume did not agree with his reasoning, but,
as with Clara and me, censure of Eric Danvers was to some extent
mitigated by the amusing frankness of the man. Certainly there
was no hypocrisy about him.</p>

<p>Of one other matter Colonel Hume was curious and he asked
Danvers why it was that if he, Danvers, as he declared, never
took part in any trickery at the actual
s&eacute;ances&mdash;Sturm always insisted he should be present
at them. Danvers explained this by telling us that upon a few
occasions Sturm had been called a fraud and actually threatened
with physical violence and he had had to protect him. He added
that he couldn't understand why he had not been allowed to be
present at the s&eacute;ance the previous night.</p>

<p>The next morning well before six o'clock I started upon my
adventurous journey to try to get hold of the papers Sturm had
made out he was holding against me. I remember how nervous I was
feeling, but on the other hand the risk I realised so well I was
running filled me with a sort of pleasurable thrill. Still, the
thrill was not without its great anxiety, as if I were caught in
the house, rack my brains as I did, I could think of no excuse I
would be able to offer to explain my being there. I told myself I
must just chance my luck, and that was all.</p>

<p>As it proved, good fortune was certainly with me, though for a
few minutes it seemed I was in very grave danger. Apart from
that, too, I was careless about one little thing, though thinking
it over later I did not see how it could do me any harm.</p>

<p>I found Cedar Road with no difficulty. It was a quiet side one
and, passing along it in my car, the red-painted house was easy
to pick out. I went by it slowly, without stopping, and parked my
car round a corner three or four hundred yards away.</p>

<p>Walking briskly back, I pushed upon the gate of the little
garden fronting the house, with my heart beating wildly. I had
already picked out from the bunch of keys the one which looked as
if it belonged to the front door, and was just about to try it in
the lock when I heard the garden gate click behind me and,
turning sharply in a terrible fright, saw a man coming into the
garden after me.</p>

<p>For the moment my guilty conscience made me sure it was
someone who had been posted to watch the house and that I was
caught red-handed. However, my relief was unbounded when I
realised it was only a bent old man with things to sell who had
followed me in. Over his shoulder were three or four brooms and
he was carrying a big basket on his arm. I waited breathlessly
for him to come up.</p>

<p>"Want a nice broom, lady?" he asked in a weak and quavering
voice. "Very nice quality and very cheap." Then, when I shook my
head emphatically, he went on, "Strong clothes-pegs, lady? Best
quality, too!" and, putting his basket down upon the ground, he
took out a peg to show me.</p>

<p>Anything to get rid of him as quickly as I could, I said I'd
take a dozen. A shilling was the price he asked, but I found the
only silver I had was a sixpence and a half a crown. He made out
he had no change and so I said he could keep the half a crown.
Slowly counting out the required number of pegs, he was profuse
in his thanks and started to tell me all the circumstances.
However, I cut him short quickly, saying I was in a great hurry
and watched impatiently as he walked slowly back up the garden
path.</p>

<p>Inserting the key into the lock, to my intense relief I
realised I had picked the right one out, as the door opened at
once and in a few seconds I was standing in the hall. The blinds
of the house were drawn and for a full minute I stood motionless
until my eyes were accustomed to the dim light.</p>

<p>Then, opening the first door I came to, I found myself in a
room which I was sure at once was the very one I wanted, as it
had all the appearance of being used by Sturm himself. A spirit
tantalus was upon the sideboard, a box of cigars upon the big
roll-top desk before the window and a good-sized safe in one
corner.</p>

<p>For a few moments I stood hesitating. The whole house was as
silent as the grave. Not a sound of any outside traffic was to be
heard, not even that hum of the great city which is said to be
never stilled. The air in the room was chilling and my teeth
chattered with the cold.</p>

<p>However the need for urgency stirring in me, I tip-toed softly
across the room to the safe. Instantly all my hopes of being able
to open it were dashed to zero. The safe was a modern one with a
combination lock! Wasting no time, I turned next to the desk. The
key to that was easy to pick out and, quicker even than it takes
to tell, I had unlocked it and rolled back the top.</p>

<p>With no searching about, my eyes at once fell upon two papers
spread out in the open desk. One was typed, consisting of a
single page of foolscap, and headed in big lettering:</p>

<br>

<p class="typewriter">REPORT UPON COLONEL JASPER AND THE GREY
HOUSE ON DARTMOOR.</p>

<br>

<p>The other was handwritten and consisted of only about twenty
lines, with the first one reading, <i>"Madeline Marie Louise de
Touraine, married to David Temple Fane, St. George's Church, Rue
de Guise, Paris, July the eleventh, nineteen hundred and twenty-
seven."</i></p>

<br>

<p>A mist rose up before my eyes and I read no more. I folded up
the two papers and thrust them into my bag. Now for the diary, I
thought and I opened drawer after drawer to find it. However, I
saw no sign of it anywhere and, anxious to get out of the house
as quickly as possible, pulled down the roll-top and re-locked
the desk.</p>

<p>I was giving one quick glance round the room in the desperate
hope that he might have left his diary lying somewhere about,
when to my horror I heard the sounds of a car being pulled up
outside and, as I stood listening, there followed the bang of a
car door being slammed to, and the voices of men growing louder
as they came up the path towards the house.</p>

<p>Darting to the window, with my heart beating like a
sledge-hammer, I peered round the corner of the blind and saw two
men, big and tall, and with all appearance of belonging to the
police. They passed out of my sight and then came a resounding
ring at the front door.</p>

<p>I crept into the hall. A few moments' silence and then the
bell sounded again. "No, evidently no one's at home," I heard a
voice say, "but now we're here we may as well have a look round.
We'll try at the back. As likely as not we'll find an unbolted
window there. It there isn't, well I expect we'll be able to
unbolt it for ourselves," and I could follow the sounds of their
footsteps as they moved away.</p>

<p>Oh, the agony of those next two or three minutes! Crouching in
the passage, I heard them rattle window after window until one of
them said, "Here, this one'll do. The bolt looks flimsy enough.
Give us the screwdriver," and there came a scraping, rending
sound of the screwdriver being pushed in hard.</p>

<p>Faced with the awful predicament in which I found myself,
strange to say my terror had calmed down and my brain was working
like lightning. It was one of the kitchen windows they were
forcing and my first thought was to go out boldly through the
front door. Fortunately, I remembered just in time that the front
door was in line with the window they were forcing and, if either
of them happened to look round, they would catch sight of me at
once.</p>

<p>I altered my plan instantly and, darting across the kitchen,
hid myself behind the scullery door only just in time, however,
before I heard the window go up and the bumps of two heavy men
alighting into the room.</p>

<p>As I had expected they would, they took little interest in the
kitchen and at once moved up the passage to investigate the other
rooms. I waited just long enough for them to be safely away
before climbing out of the window. Holding my breath in my
excitement, I walked very quietly up the garden path,
congratulating myself that I had managed everything so
cleverly.</p>

<p>However, another shock was in store for me. The car the two
men had driven up in was parked in the road just opposite to the
garden gate and to my consternation I saw there was a uniformed
policeman in the driver's seat. He was reading a newspaper and
was evidently very interested in its contents, so much so that my
appearance upon the garden path had obviously not yet caught his
eye.</p>

<p>For a few moments I stood stock still, but, realising there
was no help for it and that I must go on, I started moving on
again, but now so slowly that my walk was almost a creep. I got
nearer and nearer to the gate until, at last reaching it, I
lifted the catch very softly and, knowing that no longer could I
hope to proceed unseen, flung it wide open and like a flash was
walking up the road, with my head turned sideways so that the man
in the car would not be able to get a look at my face.</p>

<p>It was all over in a couple of seconds at most, and I was
yards up the road before I heard the sound of the gate banging to
behind me. It had all been done so quickly that I was quite
confident the man in the car would never be able to recognise me
if he saw me again. My only anxiety now was that I had left the
clothes-pegs I had bought upon the table in the study.</p>

<p>Long afterwards I heard the sequel and, of all people from the
great Gilbert Larose himself&mdash;Larose, a deadly enemy when he
was upon anyone's track, but a charming companion when he was
sporting a feather of the dove of peace in his cap.</p>

<p>He told me laughingly that it was quite correct that the two
men who had got into the house were from the police, as they were
detective-inspectors from Scotland Yard. When a few minutes later
they had returned to their car and were being driven back to the
Yard, one of them had remarked conversationally to the driver, "A
disappointment, Bob! The cage was empty and there were no birds
upon the perch! Not a soul was in the house. We shall have to
come again later."</p>

<p>Whereupon the driver had remarked, "No birds upon the perch!
But what about that one with the fine feathers who came out
through the garden gate, not very long after I heard you ringing
the front-door bell?"</p>

<p>"What bird?" had asked the inspector sharply.</p>

<p>"A young female one," had replied the driver, "very
fashionably dressed. I didn't see her face as she was too nippy
in getting away. She seemed in a bit of a hurry," and in the
conversation which followed, the inspectors to their great
annoyance knew they had been tricked.</p>

<p>I couldn't possibly have been in the garden when they went in,
they argued, they would have seen me at once, as the garden was
small and there were no bushes or trees behind which I had been
hiding. So I must have been in the house all the time. Then why
was it I hadn't answered their ring and what was I doing there
with all the blinds drawn? Why had I kept so quiet, too, while
they were opening the window, and how had I managed to slip out
when they themselves had managed to get inside? It couldn't have
been through either of the doors or they would certainly both
have heard and seen me.</p>

<p>No, directly their backs had been turned I must have gone
through the very window by which they themselves had entered. It
had been a smart bit of work and the whole thing looked very
suspicious. Only a few hours back the owner of the house had met
a violent form of death and, with his body barely cold, a woman
who had obviously no business to be upon the premises had made
her way there. Not only that, but she had evidently been in
possession of a key to the front door. She could not have come
through the back one as that was bolted as well as locked.</p>

<p>At that particular moment when the two inspectors were
debating with each other about me, I was congratulating myself
that all danger to me had passed. However, I was to learn later
that the driver of their car having seen me coming out of the
garden of the house was to prove a most unfortunate occurrence
for me, as it immediately brought Scotland Yard into the enquiry
about Sturm's death. But for that it might probably have been
left to the Eastbourne police as a purely local matter,
particularly so if nothing definite had come to light, with the
only reasonable explanation of the tragedy being then the medium
had died as the result of an accident from a bullet fired by some
boy who had been rabbiting in the nearby quarry.</p>

<p>Arriving at our house in Lowndes Square, I went breathlessly
through the two papers I had taken from the roll-top desk. They
were both very soon read. I guessed that the typed one was
Danver's, the report of his mission down into Devonshire.</p>

<p>It recorded that he had duly made his enquiries in the little
village of Bovey Tracey, about a Colonel Jasper and his
household, but had found out very little. The Colonel had left
the house upon the moor some years previously to go back to India
where, apparently, he had spent most of his life, but he had been
drowned when the boat he was upon had foundered with the loss of
everyone on board, in the Bay of Biscay when only three days out
from England. During the later years of his stay upon the moor it
was remembered that, besides two Indian servants, there had been
a young girl there, but what her name was no one seemed to know.
Also, while some people thought she had been just a servant,
others believed she was some relation of the old man. No one
remembered what she was like, as she had only been seen about a
few times and then when she was in a motor car. It was not known
if she had been upon the ship when it went down.</p>

<p>Danver's report went on that the house had been untenanted
since Colonel Jasper left. It belonged now to some distant
relation of his who was living in India and had never been to see
it. However, a firm of Estate Agents in Torquay had been given
charge of it and, visiting it occasionally, were supposed to make
sure that it remained in a proper state of repair. He, Danvers,
according to his instructions, had been to look at it, but had
not been able to get inside, because the two very substantial
doors were locked and all the windows upon the ground floor
well-shuttered. However, looking through the cracks of these
shutters, he had seen some apparently worthless pieces of
furniture had been left there and in one room there were quite a
number of books and papers lying about. The house was in a very
lonely part of Dartmoor many miles from any other habitation, and
was supposed to be haunted by evil spirits.</p>

<p>Upon the other paper, which I took to be in Sturm's own
handwriting, was put down when and where I had been married to
David in Paris, that I had been employed at a jeweller's in the
Rue de Rivoli for three years and that prior to that I had earned
my living as an artist's model, sitting in the nude. It went back
to the days when I had started at Monsieur de Vallon's Academy of
Art. It had also got the address of the last flat in which I had
lived.</p>

<p>Also, somehow he had managed to get hold of the names of some
of the artists for whom I had worked and, among them, to my great
annoyance, I saw that of Tudor Meynall. However, I smiled to
myself that, with all the trouble he had been put to, he had
evidently not been able to trace me a day farther back than my
first employment at the de Vallon Academy of Art.</p>

<p>Wasting no time, I was back in Eastbourne in time for lunch.
Danver's report of his enquiries in Devonshire I burnt at once,
but Sturm's paper I showed to Clara. Of course, she was very
interested to hear how I had got on, but was rather disturbed I
had been seen by the driver of the police car. Also, she was
worried that I had not been able to lay my hand upon any diary,
but took hope in the idea that, seeing the paper about me had
been preserved, he might not perhaps have written up his diary to
date.</p>

<p>I saw her and Danvers start off for the inquest which was to
be held at two o'clock. They were both wanted to identify the
body. Back much sooner than I expected, Clara gave me a detailed
account of all that had happened.</p>

<p>After the Superintendent of the Eastbourne Police had told
briefly of their being called to the body the previous evening,
Dr. Burton had stepped into the witness-box.</p>

<p>He stated the post mortem had revealed that the deceased had
met with his death from a .22 bullet which had penetrated through
the eye and orbit wall into the brain, and the bullet he had
taken from there was produced by the police. It had been fired
either from a .22 pistol or a small rook rifle. He could not say
from what distance it had been fired. It might have been from
five yards or even fifty. Certainly the injury could not have
been self-inflicted. He added that the contents of deceased's
stomach smelt very strongly of alcohol.</p>

<p>Asked how long death had taken place before he had seen the
body, he replied, that from the condition of the clotted blood,
probably about twenty minutes, certainly less than half an hour,
which, as he had arrived just before half past five, meant that
deceased had been shot somewhere a little short of ten minutes
past the hour.</p>

<p>The doctor's evidence completed, the inquest was adjourned to
a date to be fixed later.</p>

<p>Rather to our surprise, the Superintendent, accompanied by two
plain-clothes men, arrived at the Court even while Clara was
talking to me. He asked at once if anyone among us was in
possession of a pistol or small rifle firing a .22 bullet. Clara
said she had one, and I thought she looked rather uncomfortable
when she went on to say that at the present moment it was behind
the door in the summerhouse in the garden.</p>

<p>The Superintendent's eyes opened very wide. "What, in that
summerhouse we saw in the privet lane, close near to where the
body was found?" he exclaimed, and I thought instantly that he
spoke to Clara more like the brusque policeman he undoubtedly was
than he had shown himself before.</p>

<p>Clara coloured up. "Yes, lately," she said, "I have been
keeping it there, as it was a handy place to have it when I was
trying to shoot some crows who have been coming after my
chickens. The hedge is a favourite place with the crows."</p>

<p>"But why didn't you tell us that at once," he asked sharply,
"when you knew someone had been shot close by?"</p>

<p>"I didn't happen to remember it until this morning," she said
calmly, "and then I thought I'd wait until Dr. Burton had found
out exactly what had killed him. Remember&mdash;last night the
doctor said it might have been a stone from a catapult." She
nodded. "Of course, I was intending to tell you now," and she
went on to explain that in the ordinary way the rifle was kept in
a small room near the butler's pantry. Besides firearms, the room
contained fishing rods, tennis racquets and other sporting
articles.</p>

<p>The Superintendent was frowning heavily, "But wasn't it very
unwise to leave it," he asked, "so near to the road when it could
be so easily have been stolen."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "We've never lost anything from there yet,
though more things beside the rifle have occasionally been left
there, such as books and even my little camera at times."</p>

<p>"Was it known to anyone in the house," asked the
Superintendent, "that you were accustomed to leave this rifle
there?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said Clara, "as I've only lately, as I've
just mentioned to you, taken to doing it. You must understand,
Superintendent," she explained, "that crows are very cunning
birds and seem to know at once what anyone approaching them has
got in their hands. If they see it is a gun or a rifle and not a
walking stick they fly well out of range at once. So, having the
rifle ready there, I have a much better chance of getting a shot
at them."</p>

<p>"Are you the only person who uses this rifle?" asked the
Superintendent and, upon Clara nodding, he said, "well, if you
please, we'll go and get it now," and they all went off
together.</p>

<p>A horrible fear leapt instantly in my mind. Could it be Clara
who had shot Caesar Sturm? Had she been waiting in the lane for
those crows when he had come there to look for his cigarette
case? If she had ordered him to leave the Court at once, high
words might have passed between them! Then, with the rifle ready
in her hands, upon the impulse of the moment she might have
threatened him and the rifle gone off when she wasn't intending
it to! I knew she was hasty and impulsive and not the person to
put up with intimidation from anyone! I felt sick with
apprehension at the thought.</p>

<p>It seemed quite a long time before they came back and then I
saw Clara was looking very worried. The rifle was nowhere to be
found! She was certain she had left it behind the door three
nights previously, and now it was gone! A box of cartridges which
she had also left there was still upon the summerhouse floor, but
the Superintendent had not allowed her to pick it up, as he said
they must examine any finger-marks upon it. He had added that he
took a very grave view of the rifle being missing, declaring that
if it were not found it would change the whole complexion of
everything and bring suspicions upon everyone who had been about
the Court at the time of Sturm's death.</p>

<p>At once proceeding to question us one by one, though the rifle
was well-known by sight to us all, as it had been a present to
Clara from her husband and had her monogram in big letters upon
the butt, the Superintendent soon learnt that no one remembered
having seen it lately. Also, an intense search in every place
where it was likely to have been put brought no result.</p>

<p>The Superintendent looked very grim and announced curtly we
must all now give a precise account of where we had been the
previous evening during those fatal minutes just after five
o'clock. Fortunately, the time to be accounted for was a very
short one, as there was ample evidence on hand, apart from the
supporting statement of Dr. Burton at the inquest, that Sturm had
been shot between a few minutes after five and a quarter of an
hour past.</p>

<p>From his questioning the Superintendent drew out that at
exactly five o'clock when the Town Hall clock was striking the
hour, Benson, the Court butler, had come into the lounge to draw
down the blinds there and switch on the lights, and had seen
Sturm and Danvers arriving back in their car. The car had pulled
up right in front of the hall door where Sturm had got out. Sturm
had not come into the lounge and Benson did not know where he
went, but he heard Danvers driving the car round to the garage,
and a minute or two later, when he was in the dining-room, heard
someone whom he took to be him going up the stairs.</p>

<p>George, the gardener had also heard the chimes as he was
taking in some bunches of grapes from one of the hot-houses into
the kitchen. He had stayed there only just long enough to weigh
the bunches and enter their weights in a book kept in the kitchen
for that purpose. He was very proud of his grapes and to record
their weight was a routine act with every bunch he brought in. He
said his master was very particular about it, as the growing of
the grapes was one of his hobbies.</p>

<p>Then his day's work being over, making a remark or two to the
butler who had stood watching him roll a cigarette, he had gone
straight across the garden to one of the sheds where he kept his
bicycle, lit his lamp and blown up one of his tyres which he had
noticed was rather low, and started for home.</p>

<p>By then it had been nearly dark, but there was a bright half
moon showing and, across the wide lawn, he had seen his mistress
saying goodbye to two ladies at the hall door. He had distinctly
recognised one of them as Mrs. Robinson, the vicar's wife. He
knew her quite well.</p>

<p>Entering the privet lane to get on to the road by the gate at
the end, of which he always carried a key, after cycling about
half way along, he had seen the body of a man lying upon the
ground. Jumping from his machine and propping it against a tree,
he had bent over the body and, though one side of the face was
much obscured in blood, had recognised it instantly as being that
of the Mr. Sturm who was staying at the Court. He had ventured to
touch his cheek and found it to be quite warm, though from the
pool of blood upon the ground he felt sure Mr. Sturm was
dead.</p>

<p>Not losing a second, he had run to the house and came upon the
parlourmaid, Gertrude at the back kitchen door and told her to
fetch her mistress at once. He had taken Mrs. Hume to where the
body was lying and then, upon her orders, had run back to the
house for his master.</p>

<p>He had felt so faint and ill he went on that he had been
violently sick, but for all that his mind was quite clear about
everything which had happened and, from the time when he had
heard the chimes striking five in the lounge-hall to when he was
speaking to Gertrude at the back kitchen door, only between ten
and fifteen minutes could possibly have elapsed.</p>

<p>Apparently, satisfied with what George told him, the
Superintendent proceeded to question all the staff. However, they
could all be accounted for. My alibi, too, supported by the two
nurses was unassailable; Clara was accounted for by her having
been seen by George with the Vicar's wife just before he had come
upon the dead body; Colonel Hume had been in the smoking room
from about four o'clock until the butler had run in with George's
message from his mistress that he, the Colonel, was to come at
once. At the moment of the summons Colonel Hume had been wearing
his carpet slippers and, lying back in an armchair, had been half
dozing before the fire.</p>

<p>I was very relieved to notice that Clara seemed to have thrown
off her uneasiness about the rifle not being able to be
found.</p>

<p>"I don't see, Superintendent Hanson," she said emphatically,
"that the fact of my rifle having been taken by someone, in any
way, as you seem to think, throws any suspicion upon anyone in
the house. If any of us had shot Mr. Sturm with it, what reason
should we have had in hiding it? Surely&mdash;rather we should
have wiped the finger marks off it and put it back to where it
had been." She answered her own question. "No, it looks to me now
as if at last we have had a thief coming into the grounds,
someone who had got in from the road and taken the rifle any
moment after those three afternoons ago which was the last time I
used it."</p>

<p>"But how would anyone but someone in the Court have known it
was there?" queried the Superintendent doubtfully.</p>

<p>"He mayn't have known it was there," snapped Clara.
"Trespassing in the lane, he may have come upon it by chance. If
he had come on purpose why didn't he take the box of cartridges.
They were just under his eyes." She spoke as if very annoyed. "I
think the whole thing was an accident. Boys are always shooting
in the quarry just across the road, and probably it was a stray
bullet which hit him."</p>

<p>"But we can't learn of any boys being there yesterday,"
rejoined the Superintendent. "No one that we can find out heard
of any shots being fired."</p>

<p>"Still they may have been fired for all that," countered
Clara. She added scornfully: "One must have been fired to have
killed Mr. Sturm, but no one heard that."</p>

<p>The following day was Sunday and we saw nothing of the police
or detectives. The Sunday papers had a lot to say about the
tragedy and, to Colonel Hume's great annoyance, all day long
sightseers were strolling up and down the road looking at the
house. In the evening one of the maids brought in some rather
disturbing news. A woman from a house about two hundred yards
away had gone to the police and told them that she remembered
having seen on the Friday a man climbing over the gate leading
into the privet lane. She thought he had come back to climb over
from a lorry farther up the road. She gave a poor description of
the man but believed she would recognise him if she saw him
again. She couldn't remember exactly what time it was, but she
had an idea it was early in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Eric Danvers was still staying with us. The Superintendent had
told Clara they would be greatly obliged if she would put up with
him for a day or two longer as they might want to ask him some
more questions about his dead employer.</p>

<p>On the Monday we still saw nothing more of the detectives, but
Colonel Hume was so upset by everything that he had a slight
heart attack and Clara called in Dr. Burton to attend to him. The
doctor brought in some rather startling news that he had been
told on the quiet by a policeman whose wife he was attending.</p>

<p>It appeared that for some time the police had been very
interested in Sturm and keeping an eye upon him. They knew who he
really was and were certain his work as a medium, though it
brought him in quite a lot of money, was really only a blind to
cover other activities. They knew he was an important member of a
ring handling forbidden dangerous drugs in a large way. However,
though they have gathered plenty of evidence against him as yet
they had made no arrest, hoping, through him, to uncover the
other ringleaders of the gang. His finger-prints were recorded at
Scotland Yard as, years ago, he had served a term of imprisonment
for another offence.</p>

<p>Danvers was good company and Clara was quite agreeable he
should stay on at the Court. However, after dinner on the Monday
evening, she said to me suddenly, "Do you know, Marie, I rather
think that this entertaining young man has something to do with
the police. He's been called to the telephone cabinet four times
today, and twice, when I happened to pass by when he was inside,
I noticed that when he was listening to whomsoever was speaking
he turned right round as if to make sure no one was near the
cabinet to overhear what was being said. It struck me both times
that his precaution was most marked. Another thing, when the
Superintendent was last up here he seemed much more friendly in
his manner towards him than he was towards us." She nodded
darkly. "I'm going to keep a sharp eye upon him. I can't make out
what's up."</p>

<p>And then Clara did what I thought at the time was a very
foolish thing, at any rate it meant her telling the police a lot
of stories later. Upon the Monday morning, in a spirit of morbid
curiosity to look round the place where the medium had been shot,
she went into the privet lane and was just passing the gate at
the end when she saw a Hickson Provision Store van coming slowly
up the road with a man whom she guessed rightly was Anton Meynall
driving it. Upon the impulse of the moment she waved to him to
stop and come over to the gate to speak to her. With a scowl he
complied with her request.</p>

<p>"I am Mrs. Hume of the Court here," she said quickly, "Mrs.
Temple Fane's sister-in-law, and you are Anton Meynall, aren't
you?"</p>

<p>He nodded a curt assent. "And what about it?" he asked.</p>

<p>She went on in a whisper. "Now did you come into the Court
grounds again that Friday evening?"</p>

<p>He stared at her blankly. "I don't know what you mean," he
said.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you do," she retorted. "Now did you come back here?
It's quite safe your telling me. I tell you I'm Mrs. Fane's
sister-in-law."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I don't know either of you," he said.
"I've never heard of you. Good afternoon. I've got my work to do
and I've no time for gossip," and without another word he went
back to his van and drove away.</p>

<p>"A very discreet young fellow," commented Clara, telling me
about it. "No one will ever get anything out of him."</p>

<p>So things were up to the Tuesday morning and then the
Superintendent rang up Clara quite early, asking her please to be
sure that she, Colonel Hume, Danvers and I would be at home about
eleven o'clock when he was intending to call.</p>

<p>"Most annoying," said Clara crossly as she came away from the
phone. "What more can they want to ask us?"</p>

<p>At eleven sharp the Superintendent arrived when we four were
all together in the lounge. He had driven up in an imposing big
police car, accompanied by a stout and rather heavy-looking
middle-aged man who had policeman written all over him and whom
he at once proceeded to introduce.</p>

<p>"This gentleman," he said, "is Chief Detective-Inspector
Charles Stone and he's come down from Scotland Yard to help us."
He laughed. "He's really not half as frightening as he looks.
Indeed, he's a very gentle and kind-hearted man. I know him well,
as he and I joined the Force together."</p>


<hr>


<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br>

THE COMING OF GILBERT LAROSE</h2>

<p class="first">NOW I am quite sure that, if I had been warned
beforehand that so important an officer as a Chief Detective-
Inspector of Scotland Yard was going to be sent down to find out
at whose hands the medium had met his death, I should certainly
have been quaking in my shoes and filled with a sickening terror
as to what was going to happen next.</p>

<p>Now, however, having actually been confronted with him, my
state of mind was not by any means a terrified one, for in
appearances he was very different from the grim suspicious
accuser I had imagined all detectives who had worked themselves
up to a high position must be.</p>

<p>Although undoubtedly there was that about him which, as I say,
would make one think at once of a policeman, he yet looked
fatherly and kind-hearted, and with nothing of a bully about him.
Certainly, he seemed very capable and I guessed those shrewd and
big ox-like eyes under their shaggy brows would never at any time
miss anything of what was going on.</p>

<p>The Superintendent explained who we were and the Inspector
bowed smilingly, not, however offering to shake hands. He took us
all in with a quick appeasing glance, but I somehow thought he
regarded Eric Danvers with a harder look than he gave anybody
else.</p>

<p>"A most worrying business this for everyone," he boomed in a
big deep, voice, "but we'll try to make it as less unpleasant as
possible." He took a sheaf of papers out of his breast pocket.
"Now Superintendent Hanson has provided very full notes for me
about you all. Still to some extent I'll have to go over the same
ground again and so, if you don't mind, I'll go on to take you
one by one."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Clara who had been expecting that and had
prepared for it. "You shall have the library to yourselves."</p>

<p>I say Clara had prepared for it, but hardly in a way the
Inspector would have approved of, had he only known. It happened
that her uncle, a childless widower who had bequeathed Mead's
Court to her, had been an eccentric old man who for many years
had been at work upon a book dealing with the history of the
religions of the world. In his later years his writing had been
the obsession of his life, and day after day for many hours on
end, he would shut himself in the library, giving the strictest
orders then that on no account was he to be interrupted in his
work.</p>

<p>To such extremes was this order carried out, that between the
library and the adjoining room he had had a dumbwaiter built into
the wall, so that his mid-day meal could be served on it, without
his being disturbed. When upon his death Clara had come into
possession of the Court, she had let the dumb-waiter remain, but,
to do away with what she considered its unsightly appearance in
the library, had had it made into a shelf there to carry some
rows of more books.</p>

<p>The result was that in the library there was no sign of the
dumb-waiter being there, while in the little adjoining room, if
you opened the door of this dumb-waiter, you could plainly hear
every word of any conversation in the library itself. Also, by a
little manipulation of the books and pushing them slightly apart,
you could actually see what was going on.</p>

<p>So, while by arrangement Colonel Hume was regaling the two
police officers and Eric Danvers with a whisky and soda before
any questioning began, Clara and I had slipped off to take up a
position by the dumb-waiter in the little room. Clara was certain
it would be quite safe, as the dumb-waiter opened in a corner of
the library well away from any window and where the light was
poor.</p>

<p>Inspector Stone had mentioned that he would question Danvers
first, and Clara was delighted she would speedily know whether
her suspicions about the latter were correct and if he indeed had
been roped in by the police to find out anything he could about
us all at the Court.</p>

<p>"Be prepared for a surprise, dear," she whispered as we
crouched down by the opened dumb-waiter door. She smiled. "We may
hear something unpleasant about ourselves."</p>

<p>In a minute or two, the library door opened and we saw Benson
show the three men in. However, with the door closed behind them,
to our amazement, for a long minute not a word was spoken.
Instead, they all stood stock-still, looking smilingly at one
another, while the Inspector had got one fat forefinger pressed
warningly against his pursed-up lips. Then, suddenly the last
named darted back to the door and, turning the handle sharply,
threw the door wide open and peered up and down the corridor.</p>

<p>"No one there," he said, re-closing the door. "Quite O.K., but
we can't be too careful." Then, with his outstretched arm
indicating Eric Danvers, he went on with a chuckle to the
Superintendent, "Let me introduce you, sir to the new star who's
just begun to twinkle at the Yard"&mdash;he bowed in mock
respect&mdash;"Detective Gilbert Larose."</p>

<p>Clara gripped my arm so tightly that I wanted to cry out with
the pain, and I am sure it was only the dire consternation into
which I had been plunged which enabled me to control my
feelings.</p>

<p>So this supposed secretary of the dead man was the dreaded
Gilbert Larose, and leaving him planted among us as they had done
for three whole days, could surely only mean that in some way the
police were gravely suspicious of us! Then of whom and why were
they being suspicious?</p>

<p>My thoughts raced like lightning through me. Of the actual
shooting they could only be suspecting Clara, but of me they
might suspect several other things&mdash;that I had known the
medium before, that for some reason I had wanted his death and,
oh! Heaven, that I had been the woman who, almost before his body
was cold, has rushed up to his house in Town, most probably to
get hold of some document or paper which in some way incriminated
her and which she knew was in his possession. Of course they
would have guessed this, as Gilbert Larose would have told them
that I had been absent from the Court in my car from so very
early on that Saturday morning until just before lunch was being
served. They would have guessed, too, I had got the keys to get
into the house, as they had not been found in Sturm's pockets
when his body had been taken to the mortuary, and of course
Larose would have told them his employer always carried them
about with him upon his person.</p>

<p>But for the moment I could give no further time to my
agonising thoughts because of what was then happening in the
library under my very eyes.</p>

<p>The Superintendent was shaking Larose warmly by the hand.
"Very pleased to meet you, Mr. Larose," he said. "When they told
me you were one of us I had no idea whom I was being privileged
to work with." He looked very puzzled. "But how on earth was it,
that you had managed to get taken on as that rascal's
secretary?"</p>

<p>"Ah, but that was almost a miracle!" explained Stone. "One of
the small fry in the dope gang had ratted and it was upon his
recommendation that Bellamy engaged Mr. Larose. A few more weeks
with him and our friend here would have uncovered the whole lot
who were peddling in those drugs"&mdash;he shrugged his
shoulders&mdash;"but of course it must happen Bellamy ran up
against that rifle bullet last week and so, for the time being,
we are again almost at a dead end."</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "No, no, a long way from that,
Charlie," he said. "I found out who three of them are and they
should lead us to the others. We are not quite as much in the
dark now, as we were when I started."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true, Gilbert," agreed Stone. "As far as you
went, you certainly made a good job of it." He seated himself
down in a big armchair and went on. "Well, what do you make of
things here?"</p>

<p>"Bad! bad!" exclaimed Larose frowningly. "The whole business
just reeks of blackmail. If that blackguard was not killed
accidentally, then whoever brought about his death has my utmost
sympathy. He was a vile man."</p>

<p>"Then if it were a case of deliberate homicide," pressed
Stone, "who would you be inclined to make out was the
killer?"</p>

<p>"Clara, that Mrs. Hume, would be my first choice," replied
Larose with a smile. "She is a woman of strong character, a brave
woman and she is protecting that young sister-in-law of hers, the
little Marie Temple Fane, to whom she is devoted and for whom she
is acting like a mother."</p>

<p>A dreadful fear surged through me as I felt Clara so close
beside me, was trembling. I did not turn to look at her, but
reached down and grasped her hand. It was icy cold and I held it
tightly. I felt I could hardly breathe. However, Larose's next
words were reassuring and I began to breathe easier at once.</p>

<p>"But mind you," he was saying earnestly, "if she did do it I
don't think it will ever be brought home to her, as there are
certain things to me which suggest her complete innocence."</p>

<p>"And what are they?" asked Stone.</p>

<p>"Ah, but wait a minute before we consider the actual killing,"
said Larose. "Let us first be quite certain that there was a
strong reason for someone wishing Bellamy dead and then following
it up with a deliberate murder. If there was&mdash;then the whole
thing must have started and been rushed to its dreadful climax
all in the course of three to four hours. At lunch Bellamy was a
more or less honoured guest at the Hume table, but by a few
minutes after five the Superintendent here and I were wanting to
make out that one or other who had been sitting at that table
with him had brought about his death."</p>

<p>"Putting it that way," commented Stone with a frown, "it
doesn't look like deliberate murder, but rather suggests an
accident. Now doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"That's what I think," agreed Larose. "Ordinary normal people,
such as those women are we've just been talking to, don't get
their passions stirred up to fever heat so quickly. So let us now
consider the background of the whole matter."</p>

<p>Quite a long silence followed before Larose continued slowly.
"I think that blackguard had somehow got hold of some secret of
that younger woman, though she had no idea of it until the very
afternoon he was killed. I feel sure she was not aware she had
ever met him before her sister-in-law introduced him to her at
that race-meeting in Lewes a fortnight ago last Saturday. She may
have been wrong then, as he certainly knew a lot about her, but I
believe he only started threatening her that Friday afternoon
just after lunch."</p>

<p>Stone tapped the Superintendent's memorandum, which he still
was holding in his hand. "But from these notes here she could not
have shot him, as her alibi is absolutely watertight."</p>

<p>"Of course, she had nothing to do with it," agreed Larose
instantly, "though, mind you, she wouldn't put up with any
nonsense from him, for she's as game as a pebble." He laughed.
"That first evening when we arrived here and he started upon his
slimy sex advances to her, it was a real treat to watch the way
she snubbed him. She did it so openly, too, that he soon realised
she was making him a laughing-stock before everyone, and,
accordingly, he was venomously furious with her. He stopped
speaking to her and didn't take the slightest notice of her,
while she just ignored him as if he wasn't there."</p>

<p>"Then she didn't appear afraid of him?" queried Stone.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," replied Larose, "and that's what makes me
sure he didn't unmask his guns until he got her alone in the
privet lane just before we started for that motor drive, that
last afternoon."</p>

<p>"You are certain he had a talk with her then?" asked
Stone.</p>

<p>"I didn't actually see them together," replied Larose, "but
everything pointed to it. You must understand he and I had
arranged to go for that drive soon after two. We came down to the
front door together and I left him standing there, while I went
round to the garage to bring out the car. I was away longer than
he would have been expecting me to be, as I had to put water in
the radiator. When I got back to the front door he was gone. I
shouted out for him several times and, after three or four
minutes or so, he came running up a bit breathless and jumped
into the car."</p>

<p>"Did he say anything?" asked Stone.</p>

<p>"Not a word, but I remembered afterwards I had noted
subconsciously that he had got that leering, gloating look which
he always put on when he was thinking about women."</p>

<p>"And how could you know," grunted Stone, "when he was thinking
about them?"</p>

<p>"When he spoke his thoughts aloud to me," smiled Larose, "and
actually told me what they were. For instance, when driving down
here in the car on the Friday he referred several times to the
beautiful young Mrs. Temple Fane whom we were going to meet, and
I quite thought from the way he talked that she was very sweet on
him. He was leering quite a lot then and I felt very sorry for
the girl. Still, I wasn't much interested, as he was always
gloating about some woman or other. He was an unpleasant sexy
man."</p>

<p>"And about Clara and the missing rifle," asked Stone. "What do
you make of that?"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "I can't make anything," he said. "I
was with the Superintendent here when we found it had gone and I
am positive she was genuinely surprised." He turned to the
Superintendent. "Didn't you think so, too?"</p>

<p>The Superintendent nodded. "Yes, I did. If she was acting, she
was doing it devilish well and certainly took me in for one."</p>

<p>"And she probably was acting," frowned Stone.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," commented Larose instantly. "Her face went
quite pale, and no actress, however talented, could manage that.
Besides, she looked intensely annoyed."</p>

<p>Clara here pinched me hard. "And so now, Marie, you won't
suspect me any more," she whispered. "I know you've been doing
so."</p>

<p>I grimaced at her and squeezed her hand. I certainly had been
more than half suspecting her and now felt very relieved.</p>

<p>The Superintendent was speaking. "But Mrs. Hume's alibi is not
too good," he said. "When I was having a word yesterday with Mrs.
Robinson, the Vicar's wife, she let out that she and her sister
were just about to leave the nursery when Mrs. Hume came in, and
she thinks it could have only been two or three minutes at most
before Mrs. Hume started to come downstairs with them to show
them out at the front door. So, if George, the gardener is right
and he saw them making their good-byes just before a quarter past
five&mdash;then from five o'clock until ten minutes past, these
very fatal ten minutes, we have nothing to go upon expect Mrs.
Hume's own words to tell us where she really was. She declares
that except when she was upon the phone putting off all the
dinner-party guests, she was in her own room from three o'clock
in the afternoon until she went up to the nursery only a minute
or two after five."</p>

<p>A long silence followed and, crouching so close to Clara, I
could hear the beating of her heart. I could not help it, but I
felt uneasy again. I remembered clearly how very, very short the
time had been after Clara had come into the nursery before she
had started to take Mrs. Robinson and her sister downstairs.</p>

<p>It was Larose who broke the silence. "But against that,
Superintendent," he said thoughtfully, "I put the disappearance
of her rifle, as that to me is a most important happening.
Surely, if she had shot the man, say by accident or in a sudden
burst of temper, as a shrewd and far-seeing woman she would have
grasped instantly that to hide the rifle away would have been the
worst thing for herself that she could do. It would at once
suggest her as being the guilty party. No, what any guilty person
would have done would have been to wipe away his or her finger
marks and put the rifle back where it had been. Then everyone
would have been baffled."</p>

<p>"Well, Gilbert," said the stout inspector, "we'll leave her
alone for a minute." He eyed Larose most intently. "Now you are
quite sure in your own mind, are you not, that if indeed it was a
definite case of murder, we shall be able to produce strong
circumstantial evidence that he was killed because he was
attempting to blackmail that little Mrs. Temple Fane?"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "I don't say we shall be able to
produce that evidence, Charlie, but I believe it's there. I think
Marie has some well-hidden secret in her life and that now-dead
blackguard got very close to finding it out."</p>

<p>"What kind of secret?" frowned Stone.</p>

<p>Larose laughed. "Why a sex one, of course! What other kind
would you expect of a pretty woman? She's not likely to have been
a pick-pocket, or a counterfeiter, or a spy in the Great War, is
she? No, probably she had a lover in her pre-nuptial days and
Bellamy knew something about it at the time." He spoke
impressively. "But does not every one of Bellamy's actions of the
last fortnight suggest blackmail? He is introduced to Marie at
the Lewes race-meeting as Mrs. Temple Fane, the wife of a
well-known wealthy city man, and he recognises her as someone he
knew years ago. He gets busy at once and puts himself to no end
of trouble spending three days in Paris enquiring about her past
life."</p>

<p>"Four days," corrected Stone, "as we saw on that diary he had
got in his safe."</p>

<p>"Oh, his diary!" exclaimed Larose, "and of course, it was for
that Marie rushed up to his house on the Saturday morning. He
must have told her about it." He went on. "And not content with
those enquiries in Paris, he sent me racing down
into&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But to my intense relief, as I was trembling in fright that
Clara was about to hear about Colonel Jasper and the house upon
the moor and would start wondering at once if it had anything, of
which I had not told, to do with me&mdash;we heard a knock upon
the library door and Benson entered to tell us the Superintendent
was wanted upon the phone.</p>

<p>"And I'll go out, too," whispered Clara, as the Superintendent
left the room, "in case I am wanted for anything. It would be
dreadfully awkward if Benson came looking for me here."</p>

<p>With the Superintendent away, Larose went on to tell Stone
about his enquiries in Devonshire. "But what they had to do with
this Marie here, of course I don't know. That they had something
I should certainly think, as she went off with my report as well
as that paper about herself when she was Miss de Touraine, which
were lying open in Bellamy's desk. I had noticed them both there
just before we left the house to drive down here. I had got a
squint of Bellamy's notes when he was out of the room."</p>

<p>The Superintendent was back very soon. "A bit of luck!" he
said smilingly. "We know now who that man is who got over the
gate in the privet lane that afternoon. The same woman who saw
him then recognised him in the road here again a few moments ago,
and rang up the Station to tell us. She says there is a lot she
can tell us about him. He drives the delivery van for Hickson's,
a grocer in Terminus Road. We'll pick him up and question him
when I get back from here, though I think we had better have a
talk with the woman first, as she lives so close to the
Court."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" exclaimed Stone. "We're getting on slowly." He
turned back to Larose. "Now what about the husband here, old
Colonel Hume?"</p>

<p>"Of course, he's got no proper alibi," said Larose, "but I
can't see him taking the law into his own hands and shooting
anybody. He's a most conventional man and loathes all kind of
publicity. He would never be the means of bringing any scandal
upon his own house. Certainly, he was furious with Bellamy for
interfering with that young housemaid and, directly he heard of
it, insisted his wife should cancel the dinner-party and
everything and pack Bellamy off the moment he came in. Still,
rather than suspect him I'd suspect others who were present at
the s&eacute;ance the previous night, that Major Button, for
instance."</p>

<p>Stone scanned down the names in the Superintendent's notes.
"Oh, the tiger-killer!" he exclaimed. "Why him in particular?"
and Larose at once related how the old man had found out he had
been hoaxed about the spirit of his Johore beater appearing at
the seance and was thirsting for the medium's blood.</p>

<p>"And it's not impossible to imagine," he laughed, "that he did
saunter round here with his rifle that afternoon&mdash;he lives
only a few hundred yards up the road&mdash;to give Bellamy a
fright if he caught sight of him. He's a very hot tempered old
gentleman."</p>

<p>"Ah, one moment!" exclaimed Stone. "Going back to that Mrs.
Hume again. During that Friday afternoon I understand she'd been
busy phoning up to put off all those people who would have been
coming to the Court that night, and so I should say she would
have worked herself up into a fine state of annoyance by the
trouble she'd have been put to. So, when Bellamy got back from
his drive and went straight into the privet lane&mdash;if she
happened to be there after those crows, as she makes out, and ran
into him unexpectedly, isn't it quite likely that in her
disturbed state of mind, she upped with her rifle and, with no
thought of what she was doing, gave him a bullet at once?"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "I don't think so. I'm sure she
wouldn't have denied herself the pleasure of first lashing out at
him with her tongue and, knowing the fine gentleman as I so well
do by now, it's pretty certain he would have hit back with
language which would certainly have not been over-choice. He was
full up to the neck with Scotch, as he had made me pull up at
almost every pub we had come to that afternoon. He was a
foul-mouthed brute when he was in a rage and got fairly
going."</p>

<p>A short silence followed before Stone said, "Well, we must get
on with our enquiries, and I've got a good idea. So that you can
remain here to listen all the time I'll tell Mrs. Hume I've roped
you in to take short-hand notes. I'll explain I thought the
Superintendent here would be able to do it, but find he can't
write shorthand and you can.</p>

<p>"That'll be all right," nodded Larose. "As the dead man's
one-time secretary, that'll appear quite the natural thing."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Stone. "Then I think we'll take Marie
first." He hesitated a few moments. "Now should we put down our
good cards straight away and bounce her into admitting that
Bellamy was threatening blackmail and that it was she who rushed
up to Cedar Road on Saturday and stole those papers from his
desk?"</p>

<p>"No, no, don't do that," said Larose instantly. "For the
moment don't let it come out that we have good reason to believe
anyone is benefiting by the man's death. Leave out the matter of
blackmail altogether and just concentrate upon finding out what
everyone was doing at the time it happened. Then they'll be less
upon their guards and may make a slip somewhere. In particular,
deal tactfully with Marie for, while we are certain she cannot be
the actual killer, if the killing was a premeditated one she is
sure to know who did it because the killing was done to save
her."</p>

<p>Stone shook his finger at Larose. "But there's going to be no
sentiment here, Gilbert," he said very sternly. "If there was a
murderer we're out to get him or her, and no face, however
pretty, is going to stand in our way."</p>

<p>"Of course not, of course not!" agreed Larose readily, but all
the same he gave the Superintendent a sly glance of
amusement.</p>

<p>"Then while we are on personal matters," smiled the
Superintendent, "what about yourself, Mr. Larose? I didn't put
down anything about you in those notes of mine Mr. Stone has got
there!"</p>

<p>"There was no need for you to," smiled back Larose. He turned
to the Inspector, "I was alone in the garage, Charlie, from the
moment I drove in the car until I came out to see Mrs. Hume and
the man, whom I learnt afterwards was Dr. Burton, striding over
the lawn in a great hurry. From their haste I was curious as to
what was up and followed after them to see."</p>

<p>"But why so long in the garage?" frowned Stone.</p>

<p>"I fancied the car had been running sluggishly and looked to
see if there was any dirt in the carburettor. There was and I
took it out. Then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here, I say, there's something wrong there," broke in the
Superintendent. "That butler told me he heard you come into the
house very soon after you had dropped Bellamy at the front door
and driven off to take the car into the garage."</p>

<p>A short silence followed and Stone whistled. "Then it wasn't
you, Gilbert, whom he had heard come in and go up the stairs." He
looked very grave. "In all probability it was the very party we
want."</p>

<p>"Then we'd better start questioning Benson again straight
away," said the Superintendent.</p>

<p>"And after him the other members of the staff," said Stone.
Then as the Superintendent rose to his feet and moved to the door
he added, "And explain to Mrs. Hume, please, how it
happens"&mdash;he grinned&mdash;"Mr. Eric Danvers is going to be
present at the questionings."</p>

<p>"Quick, Marie, quick," whispered Clara who had long since
returned to my side, "we mustn't be caught here," and she hurried
me out of the room and into the lounge where the Superintendent
found us and explained how they were to make use of Mr. Danver's
shorthand knowledge.</p>

<p>When he had left us Clara regarded me quizzically to see how I
was taking it all. Then the troubled and uneasy expression upon
her face changed to one of some amusement. "But wasn't it funny,"
she laughed, "to hear ourselves turned inside out? That Gilbert
Larose is a very clever man and we shall have to be much more
careful in our replies to him than if the Superintendent were
questioning us."</p>

<p>"But how mean of him," I said hotly, "that he asked for your
hospitality here so that he could spy upon us to find out
anything about us he could."</p>

<p>"Well, as you've just heard," said Clara confidently, "he
didn't find out much. He made a lot of guesses and some of them
were very clever ones." She nodded, "One thing, we didn't make an
enemy of him, and another, he has no sympathy for that wretched
Sturm, or Bellamy, as I suppose we must call him now."</p>

<p>I looked Clara straight in the face. "But tell me honestly," I
asked with a little quiver in my voice, "was it you who
deliberately shot that man?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," she replied instantly. She laid her hand
affectionately upon mine. "And you take this in Marie dear,
whatever they may find out about me and wherever this smart
Gilbert Larose may perhaps catch me tripping in some little
things"&mdash;she spoke most impressively&mdash;"they can never
bring anything home to me. So, if you are ever worried about me,
remember I have told you I haven't the very slightest fear for
myself. I shall have a perfect answer to everything"&mdash;she
nodded&mdash;"in the end."</p>

<p>I felt myself shaking. "But you frighten me, Clara," I said.
"You make me think you are in great danger."</p>

<p>"But I'm not," she said emphatically. "I am in no danger at
all." She frowned. "Still, I can see that Inspector Stone
suspects me"&mdash;her frown changed into a half smile&mdash;"and
he may suspect even more before he has done with me." She spoke
quickly. "And one thing more, Marie. I can see now that, if they
ask you about it, you mustn't deny that brute followed you into
the privet lane and had a talk with you. After what we've just
heard Mr. Larose say it will be wisest for you to admit at once.
We mustn't tell more untruths than we are obliged to and so give
them more chances of catching us out."</p>

<p>"All right," I nodded, "I know what to say."</p>

<p>Now how all the servants came out of the gruelling questioning
they had to submit to at the hands of the Chief-Inspector Stone
we learnt from Mabel, Clara's own particular maid, and some part
of it was certainly disturbing. It was not only that the butler
was mistaken in his evidence that he had certainly heard someone
come in by the front door and go up the stairs a very few minutes
after five, but Betty, the under-housemaid was positive she had
seen someone, whom in the fallen dusk she had taken to be her
mistress, cross over the lawn somewhere about the same time.</p>

<p>The questioning by Inspector Stone was many times more
thorough and lengthy than that of the Superintendent's had been.
Benson was examined at once, but Betty's evidence was not taken
until the afternoon.</p>

<p>"But you say, Mr. Benson!" said the Inspector, "that when you
were in the very act of switching on the lights and pulling down
the blinds in the lounge hall you heard the Town Hall clock
striking five?"</p>

<p>"That is so, sir," said Benson.</p>

<p>"And after attending to these lights and the blinds," said the
Inspector, "you went straight away into the dining-room and then
you heard someone come in through the hall door."</p>

<p>"No, not quite straight-away, sir," said Benson. "I did a
little tidying up in the lounge, first. I straightened up the
cushions upon the chairs and settees and put some coals upon the
fire and swept up the hearth. Then I folded up some newspapers
lying about and put them in the rack. Also, I emptied the
ash-trays and put the ashes in the fire. After these little
duties it was then I went into the dining-room and attended to
the blinds and fire there."</p>

<p>"And when you were performing these last duties," said Stone,
"you heard someone opening the inner front door?"</p>

<p>The butler hesitated. "It mayn't have been the opening but I'm
not sure. At any rate, without thinking about it I certainly got
that impression, perhaps because I didn't see anyone pass the
open dining-room door or hear him moving about anywhere
downstairs."</p>

<p>"Well, then you heard whoever it was who had come into the
lounge go upstairs?" said Stone.</p>

<p>The butler hesitated again. "I may have done so, sir, I heard,
sir," he said, "but it was probably the clicking of its being
shut to. It always does make a click as the door handle is not a
gentle one to turn."</p>

<p>"And how long do you think it was before the door clicked
after you had heard the striking of those Town Hall chimes?"</p>

<p>Benson shook his head. "I couldn't say, sir. Certainly not ten
minutes, I am sure." He smiled. "I am always pretty brisk in all
my movements."</p>

<p>The questioning of the staff went on and, as it appeared
obvious it was going to take some time, Clara sent word into the
library that she would be pleased if they would come into lunch,
which accordingly, at one o'clock they did.</p>

<p>Now, certainly, as the Superintendent had said, Inspector
Stone did not seem a very formidable person and he and Clara, in
particular, were soon chatting amicably together as if they were
quite old friends, indeed monopolising most of the conversation
at the meal.</p>

<p>"And when you are upon an enquiry such as this one," asked
Clara with an assumption of great innocence, "do you find that
most people generally tell you the truth?"</p>

<p>The Inspector looked amused. "Oh, yes, I think so," he said,
and then he added quickly, "that is, of course if they have
nothing to hide?"</p>

<p>"But if they have," went on Clara, "can you tell when they are
speaking untruths?"</p>

<p>"We've a pretty good idea," nodded Stone. "That's where our
training and experience comes in."</p>

<p>"Then it seems to me," frowned Clara, "that the dice are
loaded against any poor guilty creatures directly he or she comes
into the room. If you can tell at once that they are
story-tellers then they haven't a chance."</p>

<p>Stone laughed merrily, "Oh, no! It isn't as easy as that. We
may be quite sure they are untruthful, but we can't always bring
it home to them. They may be too clever for us. That's the
snag!"</p>

<p>Clara looked troubled. "And do you think it is always wrong,
Mr. Stone, when sometimes people don't speak the truth?"</p>

<p>"Of course, it is," said the Inspector firmly. "Why, that's
perjury, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"But suppose, of course unbeknown to your wife," said Clara,
"you have a sweetheart&mdash;would you feel bound to tell the
truth if someone asked you about her?"</p>

<p>Stone made a grimace. "Ah, but you are getting too subtle for
me now," he said. "In a matter such as that there would be a lot
of pros and cons to consider." He spoke sharply. "As an educated
woman you know quite well that truth and untruth in such matters
have always been considered upon an entirely different plane to
ordinary affairs." He threw out his hands disgustedly. "But who
would want a fat old man like me for a sweetheart? I am stones
and stones too heavy for romance. Just look at me now. One Stone
by name, but many, many stones too many by nature."</p>

<p>Everybody laughed, but Clara evidently had not finished with
the stout Inspector yet, as she asked next, "And I suppose, Mr.
Stone, it must be very difficult to work your way up to be a
tip-top detective."</p>

<p>"Not at all," smiled Stone. "All that anyone wants is to have
a good-looking face and slim figure like our friend Mr. Danvers,
here, and success is assured. Then you'd float up to the top like
a cork?"</p>

<p>Clara nodded. "Yes, I think he'd make a good detective. In
fact I've been thinking that in many ways he and you might be
blood-brothers now. In the short time you've been together here
in the house I've noticed several things that you have together
in common. You smoke the same brand of cigarettes, you both use
the same kind of pencils and from the seller's names on the bands
inside your hats I see you both go to the same shop for them."
She seemed interested. "That's very remarkable as Alfred Perkins
in the Vauxhall Bridge Road can't be a very well-known
hatter."</p>

<p>I would have loved to have had a good laugh. So that was what
Clara had been working up to? She had been pulling the
Inspector's leg with a vengeance and letting him see quite
plainly that it would be no timid yes-and-no miss he would be
questioning later.</p>

<p>I took a quick glance at Larose. He was looking down his nose
and, I thought, suppressing a grin. However, the Inspector rushed
manfully into the breach.</p>

<p>"Oh, but Alf Perkins, is a very well-known hatter," he
exclaimed volubly, "and I've been going to him for years. Indeed,
I don't think now I should be comfortable in any hat but his,"
and he went on to expatiate upon their good quality and the long
time they lasted him.</p>

<p>The meal over, the interrogation of the staff was renewed, but
it was not until they had the very last of them before them, the
little under-housemaid, Betty, that any grist came to their mill.
Then what she told them was very startling and certainly brought
Clara strongly under suspicion.</p>

<p>Stone was asking her the usual questions&mdash;what exactly
was she doing that Friday afternoon just after five and,
remembering she had seen George the gardener bringing the
hot-house grapes into the kitchen when he had knocked off work at
the usual time of five o'clock, she was able to tell him quite
accurately. She seemed to be enjoying the importance of being
questioned. She said she had gone straight up from the kitchen to
her bedroom to make herself tidy and shut the window and pulled
down the blind. She had heard no sound of any rifle going off,
but was sure she would have done had one been fired, as her
window looked out upon the drive and across the lawn to the end
of the privet lane.</p>

<p>"Then you saw and heard nothing?" smiled Stone, apparently
about to dismiss her.</p>

<p>"No, sir," she smiled back, no doubt thinking what a nice
gentleman the great detective was, and then she added as an
afterthought, "except that I saw Mistress coming up to the front
door."</p>

<p>Stone took her up at once. "Oh, you saw your Mistress, did
you, coming up to the front door?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Well, I think it was Mistress," she replied, "though, as it
was practically dark then, I couldn't see her very plainly, but I
judged it was her by the way she walked."</p>

<p>The girl said afterwards that the detective seemed very
interested and repeated the question several times in different
ways before dismissing her.</p>

<p>So that was how the position was when immediately after Stone
had finished with Betty, Eric Danvers, or Gilbert Larose as we
now knew him to be, came into the drawing-room to look for Clara.
We guessed afterwards that he had been sent to fetch Clara as
quickly as possible before she had heard what the under-housemaid
had said.</p>

<p>Clara rose up to follow him, when suddenly an idea came to me.
"And I'll come, too," I said. "It will be all right for us to
come together, won't it, Mr. Danvers?"</p>

<p>I thought Larose's eyebrows went up ever so little, and for
the moment it seemed as if he were going to say something,
perhaps, I thought to raise some objection, but, of course, as
the supposed Danvers he could have no say in the matter and so,
he just smiled, and we walked into the library together.</p>

<p>The Inspector who had risen to his feet as we came in frowned
when he saw us both. "But it was Mrs. Hume I wanted to question
first," he said. "If you don't mind, Mrs. Fane, I'll take you
afterwards."</p>

<p>"I don't mind that at all," I said, speaking as sweetly as I
could, "but I want to be present to hear what my sister-in-law
says, first"&mdash;I laughed&mdash;"so that we shan't contradict
each other." Then, as the Inspector appeared to be most
suspicious at my frankness, I went on still laughingly, "And it
can't possibly upset any schemes or traps of yours, Mr. Stone, as
we are intending to speak only the exact truth, just like some of
those innocent people we were speaking of at lunch who have
nothing to hide."</p>

<p>For a few moments the Inspector regarded me with a frown, but
then his heavy face broke into a reluctant smile and with an air
of mock resignation he motioned to us both to sit down. "And now
for one small matter which we think it best to clear up at once,"
he said. "I shall have to ask your pardon for a harmless and
quite accidental little piece of deception." He indicated Larose
smilingly. "This gentleman, whom so far you have known only as
the secretary of that so-called Caesar Sturm, happens also to be
an esteemed colleague of mine at Scotland Yard, Detective Gilbert
Larose and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You say he is a detective at Scotland Yard!" gasped Clara
with a fine assumption of amazement. She turned angrily to the
Superintendent. "And you, Mr. Hanson prevailed upon me to let him
stay on here as an honoured guest, when all the time you knew he
was acting as a spy!"</p>

<p>"No, no, Mrs. Hume," exclaimed the Superintendent looking very
uncomfortable, "at first, I was quite as much in the dark as you
were and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, please, Mr. Hanson," broke in Larose smilingly, "If I
may, let me make the explanation, as I am the real culprit if
there is one," and he went on to tell us&mdash;as we had already
overheard&mdash;that all the time while he had been working as
the medium's secretary he had been acting for the police.</p>

<p>"And you see," he finished up with, "when this Caesar Sturm's
death occurred we thought it would bring less talk and scandal
upon the Court if I remained on here as the secretary for a few
days, rather than go away and return as an officer from Scotland
Yard."</p>

<p>Clara appeared mollified. "Well, you didn't get anything from
staying on here," she scoffed, "and it appears I found out more
about you than you did about us."</p>

<p>"You certainly did," laughed Larose. "Those little matters
about the cigarettes, the pencils and the hats was a really smart
piece of work."</p>

<p>The Inspector turned briskly to me. "Well, Mrs. Fane, I think
I'll take you first." He looked down at the Superintendent's
notes. "You say you were in the nursery all the afternoon and
that Mrs. Hume arrived there just as your visitors were getting
ready to take their leave and stopped chatting with them for
quite five minutes before she took them downstairs to see them
out of the house." He looked up quickly. "Can you add anything to
that now?"</p>

<p>I shook my head. "It must have been quite five minutes,
because they discussed the babies and had time to talk about the
Vicar's health."</p>

<p>He eyed me intently. "Now Mr. Larose here," he went on, "tells
me that when he was acting as that Mr. Sturm's secretary it
seemed to him that you and Mr. Sturm did not appear to get on
very well together."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have called it a matter of getting on," I said
sharply. "The man's manners were too familiar and I daresay I
showed I didn't like them," I nodded. "At any rate I intended to
show that and I think I did because eventually he left me
alone."</p>

<p>"And you kept out of his way as much as possible?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did."</p>

<p>Stone then asked and I thought he spoke with studied
carelessness. "And when did you last see him?"</p>

<p>My answer was prompt and ready. "A few minutes after lunch. He
saw me go into that little privet lane where he was afterwards
killed and followed after me."</p>

<p>"And you had a conversation together?"</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders. "A sort of conversation, though the
talking was nearly all on his side. I told him plainly I didn't
want to have anything to do with him."</p>

<p>"But what did he have to say to you?" asked the Inspector.</p>

<p>"He declared he had met me some years ago when I was living in
Paris," I said, "but I told him I had no recollection of it." I
spoke warmly. "It is no secret, Inspector Stone, that I earned my
living as an artist's model once, but he wanted to make out there
had been something disgraceful about it and that it would be best
for me if I remained on friendly terms with him, as then he would
not tell anyone about it."</p>

<p>"Then he threatened you?" frowned the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Yes, in a way, but I let him see instantly that I wasn't the
least bit afraid of anything he might say."</p>

<p>"Then you think he was intending to blackmail you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't exactly think that," I said, "but he was looking
at me in that disgusting leering way his type of men do when they
are alone with a woman."</p>

<p>"And how did the conversation end?"</p>

<p>"He heard Mr. Larose calling for him and he went off."</p>

<p>"Then he didn't say he must talk to you again? He didn't want
you to arrange some further time and place of meeting him?"</p>

<p>"Good Heavens, no!" I exclaimed indignantly. "I wouldn't have
dreamed of such a thing."</p>

<p>"And you went back into the house," suggested the Inspector,
"and told Mrs. Hume everything straight away."</p>

<p>"Not exactly, straight away," I said, "because she had
something to tell me, first. He had been behaving offensively
with one of the maids and she said she was going to have him
packed off at once directly he returned from his motor drive. Of
course she was very much upset, as that meant cancelling all
arrangements for the second s&eacute;ance which was to have been
held that night, and, for the moment, the annoyance I was feeling
about the man passed out of my mind. However, I told her in a
minute or two."</p>

<p>"And what did she say."</p>

<p>"How well it fitted in with him going to be sent away from the
Court at once. I should be spared all further annoyance from
him."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Fane," said the Inspector. "That's all I want
of you. Now, Mrs. Hume for the few little questions I want to ask
you."</p>

<p>"Ask away," smiled Clara. "I'm all ready for you."</p>

<p>"I expect you are," smiled back the Inspector. "I take you to
be one of those ladies who would always be a hard nut to crack."
He became serious. "Now, I won't go over all the ground the
Superintendent has taken you, but there is one thing that strikes
me. Now, of course you would have been very much upset at having
to send that Caesar Sturm away in such disgrace. You would have
been thinking it an unpleasant business to be got over as
speedily as possible, would you not?"</p>

<p>"I was," agreed Clara, "but still it had to be done."</p>

<p>"Oh, by-the bye," said the Inspector, apparently going off on
a tangent, "did you happen to know Mrs. Fane had got visitors in
the nursery?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw them come," nodded Clara.</p>

<p>"Then why," asked Stone, with his question asked as quickly as
the dart of a snake, "admitting as you have just done to us that
you wanted this unpleasant interview with Sturm to be got over as
quickly as possible"&mdash;he raised his fat forefinger
impressively&mdash;"why did you waste any time by first going up
to the nursery to have a chat with Mrs. Fane's visitors? You told
the Superintendent that you knew Sturm had come home&mdash;so why
didn't you go to deal with him at once?"</p>

<p>Clara was quite ready for him. "Because I wanted to wait until
those visitors had gone," she replied instantly. "I knew they
would have to leave through the lounge where I expected Sturm
would be and I didn't want them to be witnesses of any
unpleasantness which might have been going on. I wanted as little
scandal as possible."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Stone, and it was evident he was disappointed
with her answer. However, he recovered himself very quickly and
asked, "Then why did you waste more time by going back again to
the nursery to speak to Mrs. Fane?"</p>

<p>"Just to reassure her," replied Clara calmly, "that in my
interview with Sturm I was not going to bring up her name, so
that Sturm could have no excuse to make out he was being sent
away because he had told her he knew something discreditable
about her."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Stone again and he went off at once on to
something else. "Now about this girl, Betty, who complained Sturm
had been molesting her. Are you certain she wasn't exaggerating
things or, perhaps even making them all up?"</p>

<p>"Quite certain," said Clara sharply. "She's a girl of good
character and not given"&mdash;she spoke scornfully&mdash;"to
exaggerating or making things up."</p>

<p>"Then Mrs. Hume," said the Inspector, slowly, and solemnly,
"if she tells us that on that Friday afternoon a few minutes
after five, at a time you declare you were in your room, she saw
you from her window coming up to the front door"&mdash;he
hesitated a long moment&mdash;"would you say she was reliable
witness or not?"</p>

<p>"Ask me that again, please," said Clara frowningly. "No, no, I
don't want time to think, but if she says she saw me then she is
mistaken, that is all. Remember, it would have been dusk and at
that time faces and even figures are hard to pick out."</p>

<p>The Inspector shook his head. "It was not by your face or
figure that she says she knew you, but by your walk and, if it
were dusk as you say, you do the remembering now and remember
there was a good moon shining that afternoon. It was just after
five o'clock."</p>

<p>"And that side of the house Betty was looking out upon would
have been in the shadows," smiled Clara, "until long after five
o'clock. Another thing, too, Inspector, if you had asked Betty
about her sight, which I hardly think you would have thought to
do, she could have told you she is very short sighted. As it
happens, only yesterday she was at the optician's having her
sight tested for a pair of glasses and was very amused at his
telling her that at almost only a few yards she was a blind as a
bat." She laughed merrily. "No, Mr. Stone, you haven't caught me
yet."</p>

<p>At that moment there was a hurried knock upon the door, and,
without waiting to be told he could come in, Benson brandishing a
small rifle, burst into the room.</p>

<p>"It's found, Mistress," he exclaimed excitedly, "your little
rifle. It was in the gun-room after all. Betty found it a moment
or two ago. It had slipped down behind Master's golf-bag."</p>

<p>The Superintendent sprang to his feet. "Put it on the ground,
man," he cried. "Keep your hands off. Your paw-marks will be all
over it," and Benson laid it on the carpet as quickly as if it
were a bar of red-hot iron.</p>

<p>Larose picked it up gingerly by the end of the barrel and laid
it down again upon the desk before the Inspector, where the three
police officers bent over it.</p>

<p>"It is yours, Mrs. Hume?" asked Stone.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's mine," replied Clara, and rather to my surprise, I
saw a look of intense relief upon her face. She pointed to the
monogram upon the butt and then, noticing Larose had taken a
small magnifying glass from his pocket and was minutely
inspecting the barrel, she turned sharply to Benson. "Fetch that
photograph, please, from the billiard-room," and the butler left
the room at once.</p>

<p>The Superintendent was frowning hard. "But it wasn't in the
gun-room," he said, "when we looked on Saturday, I'll swear to
that."</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't there then," corroborated Larose. He handed his
magnifying-glass to the Inspector. "And it looks as if it had
been hidden somewhere in the ground. See those traces of earth
lodging between the barrel and the butt?"</p>

<p>"And there are precious few finger-marks upon it," commented
Stone, "with those there are being probably Benson's or
Betty's."</p>

<p>The butler came back with a framed photograph of about ten
inches square. "This is an enlargement of a photograph from
<i>The Sketch,</i>" said Clara, "taken some years ago when I won
the Women's Championship Cup at Lewes. Oh, yes, it's the same
rifle I am holding then, as you tell if you use your
magnifying-glass from the scratches and dents on the butt. Also,
on the barrel there near the end you'll notice that deep graze at
the side where a waggon-wheel nipped it as it was lying upon the
ground. I had lent it to a woman friend and the careless creature
dropped it just in front of a heavy waggon as it was going
by."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's the same rifle, right enough," agreed Stone. He
leant back in his chair and regarded Clara intently. "Now what do
you make of it, Mrs. Hume, this first hiding the rifle and now
putting it back."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. "I can make no more of it than you
can," she replied. "It all seems so senseless to me. If I had
fired the shot which killed the man"&mdash;she smiled&mdash;"as
you gentlemen seem inclined to think, what earthly reason could I
have for monkeying about with the rifle like this, first hiding
it away and then putting it where it would be found?"</p>

<p>"But someone had a reason," said Stone sternly, "and someone
obviously connected with the house, as no outsider could have had
the opportunity to put the rifle back to where it has just been
found." He threw out his hands. "Just visualise how the matter
appears to us. A man is shot and within a few yards where he met
his death was a rifle the very type of which might have killed
him. Not only that&mdash;but it is known to us that this man was
of such a character that his death would certainly not have been
deplored by at least two people in this house, you whose
hospitality he had outraged by his attempted assault upon one of
your domestic staff and Mrs. Fane here whom he had insulted with
his disgraceful insinuations about her pre-nuptial life." He
shrugged his shoulders in his turn. "Then I ask you&mdash;what
are we to think?"</p>

<p>"It's not what you are to think that counts," commented Clara
dryly. "It's that of which you have absolute proof that matters."
She smiled sweetly. "You must be very sure, mustn't you, before
you issue a warrant for my arrest?" She looked amused. "Why, you
don't even know yet if it were actually a bullet from my rifle
which killed the man."</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll soon know that," exclaimed the Inspector grimly,
"but I don't think there can be any doubt there."</p>

<p>And then to my astonishment Clara seemed to drop her defiant
attitude and become all at once meek and almost resigned to
whatever was going to happen to her.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose, Inspector," she said with something of a
sigh, "that, as an experienced officer of the law, you'll think
very carefully before you take any drastic step which would do
irreparable harm to me and, besides that, if it did not prove
later that you had been justified in taking it, might altogether
ruin your career at Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Mrs. Hume," said the Inspector quite kindly, "I'll
be thinking of you as well as myself. The law may often seem hard
to us, but we have to do our duty."</p>

<p>"And you, Mr. Larose," she asked, "what do you think?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Larose in an equally kind tone, "that through
no fault of your own, you have been forced into a very awkward
situation, probably as the result of an accident. So, if you are
really deeply involved, don't go to great pains to prevent us
proving it. Far better admit what you have done and then you will
be no longer an accused facing her accusers." He smiled. "It will
be so much less public interest and excitement."</p>

<p>Clara smiled back. "Thank you so much for the loophole, Mr.
Larose," she said, "but I don't need it for, as far as I am
concerned, there has been no regrettable accident."</p>

<p>Larose shook his head disappointedly. "Then in that case, Mrs.
Hume," he said, "I am afraid it is you pitting your wits against
ours until either you or us have been proved to be in the
wrong."</p>

<p>A few minutes later the three of them took their departure
bidding us quite cordial good-byes and saying nothing about
coming up to the Court again.</p>

<p>I was surprised at Clara being so bright and lively that
evening. It was as if with the finding of the rifle a great load
had been taken off her mind.</p>

<p>"But I am very puzzled," she said to me. "I can't think who
could have meddled with it. All along, in spite of his denials to
me, I have been believing it was Anton Meynall, but, after its
having been put back in the gun-room, of course I have to give up
all that idea, as he couldn't possibly have done it without help
from someone here and that is altogether unthinkable."</p>

<p>"Besides," I said confidentially, "where I was concerned I am
sure he wouldn't lie. His remorse is real. Now don't you think
so?"</p>

<p>"It should be at all events," replied Clara, "but I wonder how
far he really would have gone with his promise to you to kill
that man. Probably, we shall never know."</p>

<p>"Don't talk about it," I said with a shudder. "It makes me
wince every time when I think of my having egged on anyone to
commit a murder. I really don't believe when it came to the point
that I should have dared to actually lure that dreadful man to
his death in the privet lane."</p>

<p>"If I had been in your place," said Clara calmly, "I should
have dared it, as judge after judge has said blackmail is the
very worst of crimes."</p>

<p>Now Clara was quite wrong in thinking we should never know how
far Anton would have gone, as we were to learn all about it the
very next morning. Not very long after breakfast Clara and I were
in the drive just outside the hall door enjoying a glorious burst
of winter sunshine, when, rather to our consternation, we saw the
big police car come racing up and the Inspector and Larose jump
out of it.</p>

<p>"I'd like a word with you, please, Mrs. Hume," and his tone
was very grim and cold.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Clara. "We'll go into the library. You come,
too, Marie," she added. She laughed brightly. "You may as well be
in at the death."</p>

<p>With us all seated in the library, the Inspector wasted no
time and came straight to the point. "This is going to be a final
show-down, Mrs. Hume," he said sternly. "We are going to put down
all our cards and advise you it will be wholly in your best
interests to deal frankly with us"&mdash;he eyed her very
intently&mdash;"for the first time."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" exclaimed Clara flippantly. "Let us see how many
aces and trumps you hold."</p>

<p>The Inspector's words came like a bullet from a gun. "Exactly
what are your relations," he asked, "with this Anton Meynall, one
of the men who drive the delivery vans for Hickson, the provision
merchant in Terminus Road, in connection with the death of that
man in the grounds of the house last week?" He spoke very sternly
"Now, please don't wait to think out any prevarications, as we
have ample evidence there has been something going on between you
two."</p>

<p>"What, a crime of passion at my age!" exclaimed Clara as if
scornfully surprised. She shook her head. "No, I am long past
that, and besides, to my knowledge I have never had any
acquaintance with this delivery-van gentleman."</p>

<p>The Inspector's eyes blazed. "Listen!" He spoke slowly and
impressively. "Upon the afternoon of last Friday, the day of the
trouble here, this man, Meynall, was seen to enter these grounds
here by way of the privet lane, and remain out of sight of the
party who saw him enter for some minutes. In the early evening of
the same day he was seen here on another part of these grounds,
but without doubt to avoid being questioned by the police
officers who had caught sight of him, he took himself off in a
great hurry leaving behind him a motor-tyre lever and, we
believe, a packet of pepper." The Inspector paused here for a few
moments to let the significance of his words sink in. He went on,
"Then on Monday, the day before yesterday, he was seen in earnest
conversation with you by the gate at the end of the privet
lane"&mdash;he spoke very slowly&mdash;"again that privet lane!"
He lifted an accusing finger and rapped out almost menacingly,
"Then do you mean to tell me these three incidents had no
connection with one another and you intend to go on denying you
know the man?"</p>

<p>With a great effort I had managed to suppress a gasp and make
my expression one of supposed perplexity and surprise. So, after
all Anton had come to the rendezvous with murder in his heart!
Good God! And he had been intending first to blind Caesar Sturm
with the pepper and then batter him to death with the tyre-lever!
And it was I who would have been responsible for this ghastly
crime! I felt sick with remorse.</p>

<p>I was glad the eyes of Larose were bent intently upon Clara
and not upon me. There was no need for her to assume any
expression of horror and surprise, for she was now undoubtedly
expressing both these emotions. To shoot a man might have been a
clean way of murder, but to blind him with pepper and then make
of his head a bloody pulp would surely always strike some
dreadful chord of disgust in the mind of the most callous
person!</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Hume," asked the Inspector grimly, "and what have
you to say to that?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Clara curtly. "It is all double Dutch to me!
Haven't I already told you I know nothing of this mysterious
strange man." She spoke angrily. "Do you mean to imply&mdash;and
of course you do&mdash;that, failing by getting an opportunity to
murder Caesar Sturm with my rifle, I had arranged with this other
man to be upon the spot and carry on for me?"</p>

<p>The Inspector ignored her question. Instead, he went on,
dropping his voice now to quiet and even tones. "Now, would not
all these three happenings taken together suggest to any
reasoning person that between you and him there existed some bond
of conspiracy, a conspiracy that was not for the well-being of
this man you knew as Caesar Sturm."</p>

<p>"You make me tired," said Clara scornfully. "Yesterday you
were asking me to confess that I shot him accidentally and
now&mdash;&mdash;" she shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"The charge takes on a graver aspect," said Stone finishing
the sentence for her, "And you must realise now where our duty
lies." He shrugged his shoulders. "As the enquiry has proceeded
everything about you has stood out in a clearer and clearer
light." He enumerated his points upon his fingers. "You met that
so-called Caesar Sturm when he was alone in the lane just as dusk
was falling&mdash;at the moment you were filled with animosity
against him&mdash;you are by nature a hasty and impetuous woman
and no doubt hot words passed between you.
Then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But there was a knock upon the door and Benson glided in
quickly. "Inspector Stone," he said, "You are wanted upon the
phone, sir. Some gentleman says he has a message for you."</p>

<p>With some irritation at being interrupted, the Inspector
turned to Larose. "You take it for me," he said. "Tell whoever is
ringing that I am very busy for a few minutes," and, with Larose
at once leaving the room, he went on with what he had been going
to say to Clara.</p>

<p>However, it appeared he had lost the thread of his argument,
and he could not pick it up again until he had gone over once
more the points he had been making against Clara.</p>

<p>"But I tell you I deny having met Caesar Sturm that evening
when he had returned in the car," persisted Clara angrily. "I
deny&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, for the sake of argument," broke in Stone grimly,
"supposing that you had met him. You would have been very angry
with him would you not, and when you ordered him to leave the
Court at once you would have told him what you thought of his
conduct? Then, most probably he would have been insulting to you
and, as we believe, with your rifle in your hand, in a sudden
burst of rage you might have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that poor little rifle of mine!" exclaimed Clara
petulantly. "If I hadn't said anything about it, which I need not
have done, you would never have had any suspicions about me. As
it is you are building up your whole case upon it."</p>

<p>"Exactly," nodded the Inspector, "and does it not follow all
reason that we&mdash;" but Larose was back in the room and
handing him a slip of paper. From where I was sitting I could see
there were only a few words on it, but their perusal brought a
frown to Stone's face, though it seemed to me that the expression
upon that of Larose was a half-smiling one.</p>

<p>Quite a long silence followed before, looking up at Clara, the
Inspector spoke again, and then I thought his tone was a much
milder one than before. "But, however strongly you may deny it,
Mrs. Hume," he said, "it seems abundantly proved to us that you
did have that conversation with the provision delivery-van man at
the privet lane gate. The woman in the house just over the road
who gave us the information is certain it was you talking to him,
and what reason would she have for making it up? She knows you
quite well by sight and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the library door was flung open and Colonel Hume burst
unceremoniously into the room. "Inspector Stone," he exclaimed,
in great excitement, "I have just had a ring from my friend, Sir
Basil Bartley, the Chief Constable, and he tells me information
has come through this moment from Scotland Yard that their
ballistic experts there say the bullet found in Caesar Sturm's
head was not fired from my wife's rifle. They declare
emphatically that it is quite impossible."</p>


<hr>


<h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br>

IN GREAT DANGER</h2>

<p class="first">FOR a few minutes, following upon Colonel
Hume's dramatic announcement that the ballistic experts at
Scotland Yard had given out that by no possibility could the
bullet which had killed the so-called Caesar Sturm been fired
from Clara's rifle a dead silence prevailed in the room. The
expression upon Clara's face was one of mingled triumph and
intense relief, while the Inspector showed no surprise at all.
Indeed, if the latter were disconcerted by this so sudden
upsetting of all his calculations, he was determined not to
allow anyone to see it. It was he who broke the silence at
last.</p>

<p>"Yes, so I was informed a minute or two ago," he remarked
casually and as if the matter were after all of no great
importance. "Mr. Larose brought in a phone message for me, direct
from Scotland Yard. So, for what it is worth, we can accept the
experts' opinion as final, as they are not in the habit of making
mistakes in matters such as this." He nodded grimly to Clara and
his voice rose. "But you please take in, Mrs. Hume, that what we
have just learnt about your rifle by no means clears up
everything as far as you and the others in this house are
concerned."</p>

<p>He spoke with the utmost sternness. "We still want to know who
was hoping to defeat the ends of justice by hiding that rifle
away. Obviously a conspiracy of some kind has been going on here,
with certain of you banding yourselves together to prevent us
learning how that man you knew as Caesar Sturm came to meet his
dreadful death." His voice boomed. "Yes, there are conspirators
among you and we are determined to find out who they are."</p>

<p>And then, to everyone's amazement, Colonel Hume leapt into the
limelight again and dropped a veritable bomb among us all. "But
there has been no conspiracy in this house," he exclaimed with a
very red face. "A conspiracy means more than one person and it is
I alone who have been mixed up in this. I am terribly ashamed to
have to admit it, but it was I who first hid the rifle away and
then, the night before last, took it back into the gun-room where
I was sure it would soon be found." He spoke emphatically. "Until
this moment no one knew anything about what I had done."</p>

<p>The Inspector's eyes boggled and his jaw dropped, while I
thought Larose was again inclined to look rather amused. Clara
moved over to her husband and placed her hand affectionately upon
his arm. "But you dear old boy," she asked with a choke in her
voice, "why did you do it? Look at the suspicion and mystery you
have caused," and she repeated her query. "Why did you do it,
Robert?"</p>

<p>"Because I was a fool, Clara," he replied gruffly, and his
voice seemed to be choking as was hers. "I know you can be a very
hasty woman and I was terrified it might have been you who had
shot that man in a moment of anger. I thought that, perhaps, you
had come across him accidentally when you had the loaded rifle in
your hand and, intending to frighten him, the damned thing had
gone off when you didn't intend it to.''</p>

<p>"But Robert, dear," she went on plaintively, "you should have
seen what a silly thing it was to do?"</p>

<p>"I see it now," he said, "but, on the spur of the moment, I
didn't see it then." He regarded her reproachfully. "I had no
idea you were going to be so foolish as to tell the
Superintendent you had got a rifle at all and that you often left
it in the summerhouse." He shook his head. "If only you had said
nothing we should have been spared this worry and annoyance."</p>

<p>"And where did you hide the rifle?" asked the Inspector very
sternly.</p>

<p>"Not half a dozen feet away," said the Colonel. "I pushed it
under the foundations of the summerhouse outside. I wonder those
who were looking for it didn't find it at once. It was almost
under their very eyes."</p>

<p>"When did you put it there?"</p>

<p>"The next morning after the man's death, almost directly after
breakfast. I had been thinking about it all night."</p>

<p>"And it was you who wiped all the finger-marks away?"</p>

<p>The Colonel nodded. "But not until I was taking it into the
gun-room the night before last. Then, of course, I didn't want my
own to be found upon it."</p>

<p>The next question was one of the Inspector's quick ones, like
a bullet from a gun. "What did you use to wipe them off with?
Quick, please, no stopping to think."</p>

<p>The Colonel scowled at the abrupt way the question had been
asked and, in reply, whipped a large silk handkerchief from his
pocket. "With this," he said sharply. "My wife is a particular
woman and the rifle was always kept clean. So you see the
handkerchief was hardly soiled at all, at any rate not enough for
me to change it at once for a clean one."</p>

<p>The Inspector and Larose bent over it and, after a moment's
scrutinising, the latter pointed to what we learnt later was a
small trace of oil.</p>

<p>"All right," snapped Stone, "we'll believe you there," and he
went on with some sarcasm, "And how, pray, Colonel Hume, after
suspecting your wife of having been a murderer, did you come to
the conclusion that your suspicions about her were not
justified?"</p>

<p>"For one thing," replied the Colonel, "because I saw how
genuinely upset she was because the rifle could not be found and,
for another, because I realised that, if she were really guilty
of the shooting, she was much too clever a woman to have admitted
so readily to the Superintendent that a loaded rifle of hers had
been all handy, within a few yards of the very spot where the man
was killed."</p>

<p>"And does not it come home to you, Colonel Hume," asked Stone
very solemnly, "that, when believing your wife to have been the
perpetrator of a dreadful crime, you hid her rifle to prevent her
being found out, you became in part guilty yourself and, in the
eyes of the law were an accessory after the fact?"</p>

<p>Colonel Hume nodded. "I know it," he said gloomily. "It was
the most foolish thing I have done in my life." He shrugged his
shoulders. "My only excuse is that I am an old man and I was so
upset at the time that I couldn't reason properly."</p>

<p>The two detectives left presently, both of them quite smiling
and pleasant in their good-byes. Still for all that it was
obvious Inspector Stone was a very deflated man, with all his
case against Clara having flattened out like a punctured
balloon.</p>

<p>"And what they found out about you, dear," said Clara to me
when we were alone, "they'll never be able to use. So we need
worry about that no more. However much, too, they may suspect you
were the woman who took that paper from Sturm's house they have
no actual proof and there again they are at a dead end." She
sighed. "Now my only anxiety is what is happening to Anton
Meynall. Unhappily we have no means of finding out."</p>

<p>However, to her great surprise, she came upon him two days
later in a quiet by-road at the back of Meads, driving his van as
usual. He saw her at once, but evidently would not have stopped
to speak to her if she had not planted herself in the road right
before the van and forced him to pull up. He looked up and down
the road and, seeing no one in sight, turned to her and asked
with obvious irritation, "Why are you bothering me again? Haven't
you the sense to leave me alone?" Though there was no one near
them, he lowered his voice to a whisper and asked hoarsely,
"Which of you killed that man? Did she do it herself?"</p>

<p>"We neither of us did it," said Clara sharply. "Both of us had
perfect alibis. It is believed now it was an accident from a
stray shot fired by some boys rabbiting in that quarry." She
spoke in a whisper in her turn. "The police have been suspecting
you?"</p>

<p>He nodded. "But what of it? They've been suspecting everybody.
They have nothing against me. It was proved to them I was working
in the shop that evening until knocking-off time at half-past
five."</p>

<p>"But we have heard you were seen in the Court grounds later
that evening," she said. "You were recognised before you ran
away."</p>

<p>"I didn't run," he scowled. "I went off on my bicycle. I had
seen several men about in the lane and a lot of torches flashing
and wanted to find out what was going on. They caught sight of me
and I had to get away quick."</p>

<p>"And you dropped a tyre-lever and a packet of pepper," said
Clara.</p>

<p>"The tyre-lever was mine," he said, "and I couldn't deny it as
I knew they would have found my finger-marks upon it." He half
smiled. "But I denied everything about the pepper and I knew they
could prove nothing there, as the paper it had been wrapped in
had become sodden from the rain and there were no finger-marks
upon it. It wasn't found until the next morning."</p>

<p>"And how did you account for your being in the grounds?"</p>

<p>"Quite simply," he grinned. "I had followed a big squirrel
going into the lane in the afternoon and in the evening had come
back to try and find where its nest was. I wanted a baby-squirrel
if I could get one." He grinned again. "The tyre-lever was to
knock the mother on the head if she came for me. They are vicious
little brutes."</p>

<p>"And they questioned you about talking to me by the gate on
Monday?" asked Clara. "The same woman who had seen you climb over
into the lane on the Friday afternoon recognised you again."</p>

<p>"I know," he scowled, "but I denied it. I denied I knew you. I
denied I had ever heard of Mrs. Fane, and I shall go on denying
it. They had me up to the police station three times to question
me, but could prove nothing and now they are leaving me alone."
He let in the clutch and started to move off. "So you just leave
me alone, too," he called out in parting, "and don't even stop me
to speak again. You'll be a fool if you do."</p>

<p>That was the last we were to hear of Anton for a long time,
but two days later, to my great consternation, his uncle, the
artist, rang me up. As I had been fearing, Caesar Sturm had
entered in his diary all the details of his visit to Paris and,
going through it, the detectives had come upon the mention of
Tudor Meynall's name, with him as being one of the artists for
whom I had worked in Paris in my model days. Inspector Stone had
pounced upon it at once, guessing that Tudor would probably be
some relation of the Anton who drove the Eastbourne delivery
van.</p>

<p>Tudor Meynall spoke now with the utmost kindness. "I have
always been interested in you," he said, "and of course, I read
of your marriage in the papers. I got the address of where you
are now staying from the housekeeper in Lowndes Square. How are
things going with you?"</p>

<p>Wondering almost uneasily what had made him ring me up, I,
however, choked down my fears and spoke as brightly as I could.
"Very well, thank you, Mr. Meynall," I said. "I am very happily
married and have two lovely little boys."</p>

<p>"That's splendid," he said, "and with a mother such as you are
I am sure they are lovely." He spoke casually. "What I've rung
you up to tell you is this. Yesterday I had a visit from Scotland
Yard who had come enquiring about you when you sat for me in
Paris those years ago. No, don't be alarmed. They said they meant
no harm to you and that their enquiries were only to round up
officially those they had been making about that medium, Caesar
Sturm, whom they recalled to me had met with that mysterious
accident those few days ago. They asked me if I knew you had met
him any time when you were in Paris."</p>

<p>"Oh, those detectives!" I exclaimed irritably. "They made a
great nuisance of themselves here, trying to ferret out things
that could have had nothing whatever to do with the man's death.
I told them I had never met him in Paris and that he was a
perfect stranger to me until he came down here." I spoke
curiously. "But what on earth made them come to question
you?"</p>

<p>"That's what I asked them," he said, "and they were very
evasive in their replies. They wanted to know next if you knew
that rascally nephew of mine"&mdash;he laughed&mdash;"but they
got nothing out of me there, as I told them it would be news to
me if you did. I shut them up sharply, saying I knew nothing
whatever about your private life. You were just a model to me and
that was all. I did add, however, that you were a young lady of
the highest reputation, respected by everybody."</p>

<p>I came away from the phone, thinking what a perfect gentleman
Tudor Meynall was. He probably guessed there had been something
on between me and Anton, but he didn't intend I should even be
aware of any suspicions he had about me.</p>

<p>Then I thought how dangerous those detectives were. Of course
they were realising perfectly well now that my life and that of
Caesar Sturm had crossed somewhere, but when and how they had no
idea. They had no proof of anything and all the information they
had gathered was of no use to them, as it lead them nowhere.</p>

<p>However, I had another shock the day before I was leaving
Eastbourne. Old Major Button called in in the afternoon for a cup
of tea when, fortunately, Clara was out. He was very full of a
meeting he had had the day previously with Larose. They had run
into each other in the Strand and gone into a hotel to have a
drink, and Larose had twitted him about the way he had been
fooled at the s&eacute;ance when the medium had made out he had
raised the spirit of Abdul Khan, the Johore beater, from the
dead.</p>

<p>"I admitted I had been fairly hooked in there," laughed the
Major, "but, still, I told him the whole s&eacute;ance had been a
piece of amusing play-acting with some nice little dramatic
touches to make it go down. He hadn't heard of you going off in a
dead faint, and when I told him about it and what it was had made
you feel ill, he started questioning me like any detective would.
He wanted to know everything Sturm had said about the military
drowned-looking old man."</p>

<p>I felt myself grow cold with a horrid feeling of uneasiness
stirring in me at once. Had not Larose in his notes about those
who had been living in the house upon the moor put down that,
besides the young girl Sturm had wanted to know about, there had
been a Colonel Jasper who had afterwards been drowned. Then if he
connected him in any way with my attack of fainting, wouldn't he
have guessed at once that I had been the mysterious unknown girl
who had been living there at the same time and so of course had
known the drowned-looking old man?</p>

<p>However, I was to hear worse than that of what he had told
Larose, as he had related to him next all about the next spirit
whose throat was all bloodied and torn.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," ambled on the Major, "he was most interested in
that second spirit and said it was enough to make anyone feel
ill."</p>

<p>Thinking over everything after the Major had gone, I felt
quite sure that whatever doubts Larose might have had before
about my path and that of Tod Bellamy having crossed before,
earlier in our lives&mdash;he could have no doubt about it now.
That we had met he would be quite certain, but I comforted myself
greatly with the thought that that knowledge could be of no use
to him at all. He would be curious and that was all.</p>

<p>The next day my visit to Eastbourne was over and I returned to
Lowndes Square quite confident that the matter of the medium's
death was closed. About a week later Clara phoned me up that the
adjourned inquest had been held and, upon the direction of the
coroner, the jury had returned an open verdict. The man known to
them as Caesar Sturm had met his death from a bullet fired from a
rifle, but by whom and under what circumstances it was not
known.</p>

<p>I was quite confident it never would be, and the consideration
of it troubled me no more. It might have been thought it would
have been the same with both the two great secrets of my life.
However, unhappily it was not exactly so there, as my mind often
harked back to that report Larose had made after he had paid that
visit to the house upon the moor.</p>

<p>I was always remembering how he had written that when looking
through the windows he had seen what looked like papers and old
exercise-books lying about in one of the rooms and I knew some of
them must have been mine. So, I told myself there would be plenty
of evidence connecting my handwriting with that of the Polly
Wiggs of all those years ago. I knew that the chances of anyone
ever using it against me were many millions to one, but still
that the evidence was there was always at the back of my mind and
it haunted me in an uneasy sort of way. I resolved that if ever I
got the opportunity I would return there for an hour or so and
get rid of all the papers in the kitchen grate.</p>

<p>I knew I should have no difficulty in getting into the house
as, when an adventure-loving girl I had often in fun climbed on
to the flat roof where the telescope had been and knew where the
cover of a small skylight close near could be lifted up. The
screws of the hinges there had rusted in the wood and I
remembered the cover itself used to be quite loose.</p>

<p>I never expected to get the opportunity of revisiting the
house, but strangely enough it came to me in the late spring of
that same year. My husband was intending to take a few weeks'
fishing holiday and accepted the loan of a friend's bungalow near
Exmouth. So down there we all went, but a week later my husband
was called away to Aberdeen upon important business. He would be
away three days and my heart beat excitedly when I realised my
opportunity had come. Less than thirty miles separated us from
the moor house and I could do everything with plenty of time to
spare during the course of one single day.</p>

<p>So I set off the morning after my husband had gone, telling
the maids I was going to visit some friends in Torquay and they
were to expect me back when they saw me. I left about ten o'clock
and, to general appearances there was all promise of a fine day,
though I was a little apprehensive to note that the glass was
falling slowly.</p>

<p>I was thrilled with the thought of the adventure. It was
getting on for nine years since I had left the moor house and I
was intensely curious as to how it would appear to me now.
However, my feelings were not all quite pleasurable ones.
Certainly I had had a lot of happiness in my three years there
and the education I had received had opened the gates to a new
and wonderful life for me. But for that education I realise so
well that I should not be where I was, with the best of husbands,
two lovely children and indeed everything I could want in the way
of money.</p>

<p>Still with all my happy and grateful memories of the Grey
House, I had yet something of a grudge against it as I was now
regarding it in a sinister light. It held that dark secret of my
life and if its old walls could have spoken what a downfall would
be mine. I should be unmasked as an impostor and in the eyes of
the world be regarded as a bad woman, which I was sure I
certainly was not.</p>

<p>Well, now I told myself I was going to destroy that last
remaining evidence against me and after that, search as they
might down all the happenings of the years, nothing could ever be
brought up against me.</p>

<p>All went all right upon my journey until I arrived at
Chudleigh, only about six or seven miles from my destination, and
then my clutch began to slip badly. I pulled into a garage to see
what could be done. The man there told me it would be quite a
simple matter to be put right, but that it would take a couple of
hours. So, I wandered about the little town while the repairs
were being done, and bought some biscuits and chocolate and a bag
of apples to have a picnic meal later on.</p>

<p>At one o'clock I was upon the road again, though I could not
say my car was running at its best. It pulled badly and I had to
drop into bottom gear to climb the steep hill up on to the moor.
Then, when only a few hundred yards from where I was to turn off
on to the ill-defined track leading to the house I struck trouble
again.</p>

<p>I was upon the wide open road when I came upon a man sitting
by the roadside having a meal and, with only a casual glance at
him as I approached nearer, made up my mind instantly that I
would not give him a lift even if he asked for one. He looked a
tramp and a very unprepossessing one at that. I was about to pass
him with a wave of the hand when to my disgust there was a loud
bang behind me and I knew I had got a blow-out in one of my back
tyres.</p>

<p>Of course I had to pull up at once and, jumping out, stood
ruefully regarding the offending tyre. I should have to change
the wheel and it was a dirty business I always hated. The tramp
was most interested and came up with part of a loaf and a large
knife in his hand and stood beside me. He looked more horrible
and dirty than ever, so much so that I regarded the lonely road a
little nervously. Obviously a foreigner, he was dark and swarthy
with a ragged unkempt beard and long hair reaching down to his
shoulders. He was wearing gold earrings and was clothed in very
dirty blue overalls. I thought he looked about forty.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon," I said after a moment's hesitation, "can you
change this wheel for me?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Spanish, no Inglish," he said, but when I
tried him in French his eyes opened very wide and he started to
speak volubly. No, he knew nothing about cars, he said, but he
could undo any nuts if I showed him what I wanted. He leered
familiarly, he was always delighted to do anything for the
ladies, indeed his manner was so objectionable that for some
reason I felt afraid of him at once and wished I hadn't let him
know I spoke French so that we could carry on a conversation.</p>

<p>I got out the jack and propped up the wheel, with him making
no attempt to render any assistance. A noisy charabanc, crammed
full with what I supposed were tourists, came rumbling by and
apparently to give his passengers a good eyeful of us, the driver
slowed down to almost a walking pace in passing.</p>

<p>The passengers gave us a cheer and one of the men blew me a
kiss, and my companion was delighted. "They think we are
sweethearts," he grinned horribly, "and perhaps even that you are
my little wife and we are upon a honeymoon together."</p>

<p>Now more afraid of him than ever, I made no comment and handed
him the spanner to undo the nuts. He couldn't have been slower
about it, talking the whole time with his eyes more upon me than
what he was doing. His glances roved up and down all over me,
taking in everything about me many times, my legs and figure in
particular appearing to interest him. He looked at my wrist-watch
and my rings, too, and it made me the more uneasy that he kept
peering up and down the road as if to see if any other cars were
coming.</p>

<p>"The car which has just gone by," he remarked with his horrid
grin, "is the only one I have seen all day. This must be a very
lonely road."</p>

<p>Then he started telling me about his private affairs, that he
was a seaman, a Spanish South American and had recently come off
a ship in Plymouth, and was walking to Bristol, where he had got
a brother, to get another one. He had got a young wife in Rio de
Janeiro, he added, but she was a bad woman and he knew she went
with other men while he was away. Then he became very curious
about me and wanted to know where I was going and if I should be
returning this way, to both of which queries I told him sharply
they were my private affairs.</p>

<p>I was very relieved when at last the wheel was fixed, but when
I opened my purse to pay him for his services I found I had only
a shilling and sixpence in silver and so had to give him a
ten-shilling note. I saw his eyes sparkle when he saw the little
roll from which I had taken it. He thanked me profusely and,
thrusting himself so close to me that I could smell the sour,
rank smell of his body, declared that all his life long he had
found pretty women the easiest to deal with. For the ugly ones he
said he had no time. I cut the conversation off sharply and made
to get back into the car, but he deliberately planted himself
before the door and, bending down his head to a level with mine,
with that horrible leer upon his face, opened and shut his lips
several times, as if inviting me to kiss him.</p>

<p>I was so furious that, forgetting all my fears I thrust my arm
forward and pushed him away. Rather to my surprise, he took it
all in good part and, moving to one side let me get into the car
and bang the door behind me.</p>

<p>"I like a little spirit in a woman," he laughed, "and so off
you go before you tempt me any further."</p>

<p>I drove off in great relief, thinking it a most unpleasant
encounter and regarding the man as nothing short of a sexual
maniac. With his horrible gloating face, he was the most
animal-like man I had ever met. When a few hundred yards farther
on I turned off the road into the track leading to the Grey
House, glancing half round, I was not too pleased to see him
standing still, watching me.</p>

<p>The nearly two miles of track took much longer to negotiate
than I had anticipated, as the going was very heavy and I was
most uneasy in speculating as to what its condition would be like
if even a little more rain came, and it certainly did not look as
if the fine weather would continue much longer.</p>

<p>Arriving at length at the lonely squat house set in the basin
between the surrounding tors, I thought with a pang that things
could not look more gloomy. By now the sky had become black and
overcast and the house looked most uncared-for and unhospitable.
However, running the car into one of the open sheds, I set about
what I had come for as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>As I had anticipated I had no difficulty at getting into the
house by way of the flat roof and I tiptoed down the stairs on to
the ground floor with my heart beating painfully. Obviously the
whole place was being terribly neglected, as there were many
places where the roof was leaking badly, indeed the big kitchen
and the passage beyond it seemed the only part of the house where
the flooring was perfectly dry.</p>

<p>In the darkened rooms with the light filtering eerily through
the shuttered windows the whole atmosphere of the place was most
depressing and I shuddered, though it was not from cold. The
barring shutters looked too complicated to undo, but I threw wide
open both doors to let in some fresh air.</p>

<p>Practically all the furniture had been removed, but some
comparatively worthless articles were still there, some kitchen
utensils, four or five plain chairs, the heavy kitchen table and
the old-fashioned dresser. Looking quickly round, in Colonel
Jasper's study I came upon the papers and books which Larose had
seen through the window, a whole pile of them which almost filled
one corner of the room. Newspapers, old magazines, books with
damaged covers and old discarded exercise books of mine. I held
my breath in consternation at the amount of evidence there was
that once one, Polly Wiggs, had been living there.</p>

<p>Upon the outside of more than one exercise-book I had written
my name in the bold sprawling handwriting of a young girl and,
most damning of all, upon the cover of one was gummed a snapshot
taken of me upon one of the very rare occasions when I had been
to Plymouth with Colonel Jasper.</p>

<p>I had forgotten all about it, but I remembered now it had cost
a shilling and been taken by an itinerant photographer upon the
Hoe. Underneath the snap, my old master had written in his
crabbed handwriting, "Our Polly, July 16th, 1921."</p>

<p>Tears welled up into my eyes. How kind he had been to me and
with what affection he had worked so hard to give me an education
that would raise me up from the drab little servant girl I had
been when I had first come to him. I sighed heavily. If he were
looking down from some far-off spirit land and knew everything, I
asked myself uneasily exactly what he would be thinking of me
now. Would he be proud of the way I had profited by his kindness
and loving care, or would he be grieving that I had put them to a
base use and was living, as I would have to live all my life now,
as an impostor?</p>

<p>But I pulled myself up sharply. It was not time for
speculating and sentimental memories. I must get rid of all these
books and papers. I would burn them on the huge old-fashioned
kitchen hearth which was quite spacious enough to have roasted an
entire sheep on the spit, and I realised it was going to be a
race against time, as the afternoon was waning and there were all
signs that one of the so-dreaded moorland mists was rising.</p>

<p>And I soon saw the burning was not going to be a simple easy
matter, as the top layers of the papers were damp, and it was
quite an appreciable time before I could get a good fire started.
Then I could not throw everything on in armfuls, but had to
separate all the papers and old books and give them one by one to
the flames.</p>

<p>Every few minutes, too, I kept running backwards and forwards
to the open door of the house to note what the weather was like.
However, there was nothing heartening there as the sky looked
more black and gloomy than ever and the mist was certainly
getting thicker. I grew more fearful than ever that it would
deepen to a fog and blot everything out.</p>

<p>I hurried feverishly, but it was well past four o'clock before
I had got the last of the papers burning. By then there was a
huge pile of ashes on the hearth, but I stirred them well with an
old broom handle and at last was confident there were no pieces
large enough for anyone to make out any handwriting.</p>

<p>Then, just as I was looking round to make sure I had burnt
everything&mdash;my blood froze in my veins and I gasped in
terror at the sound of heavy footsteps coming up the passage from
the direction of the front door. Paralysed in my fright, I could
not move hand or foot, but just stood stock still as immovable as
a graven image.</p>

<p>The footsteps came nearer and nearer, the kitchen door was
flung wide open and, to my dire consternation, I saw the
dark-faced seaman whom I had met upon the road now entering the
room. He was grinning, with his usual horrible leering look.</p>

<p>"Ah, I was sure it would be you," he exclaimed with a
chuckling laugh. "A man I spoke to after you had left me told me
there was a short cut over the moor here and, hoping I should see
you again, inclined me to take it." His eyes roved round. "Whose
house is this? Is no one living here?"</p>

<p>With a supreme effort I pulled myself together and found my
voice. "This house is private," I said hoarsely. "You are
trespassing. The gentleman it belongs to may arrive any minute.
You had better not be found here."</p>

<p>He grinned evilly. "But I'm doing no harm, am I? The track
leads onto Okehampton and I'm going there."</p>

<p>"There is no further track," I said sharply. "It stops here
and leads nowhere. You had better get back on to the main road as
quickly as you can. There's a fog coming and if you're not quick
you won't find your way."</p>

<p>"The fog's come already," he said. "Outside you can barely see
twenty yards before you, and this is as far as I'll go tonight."
He unbuckled the knapsack from his shoulders and threw it down on
to the floor. He grinned his evil grin again. "If that gent you
are expecting don't come quickly he'll never be able to find the
house." He regarded me impudently. "Any wood about, do you know?
We shall want some to keep that fire going. It's going to be
bitter cold tonight."</p>

<p>The horror of the implication of his words struck at me like a
blow and I stared blankly at him.</p>

<p>"I asked you if there was any wood about," he said roughly.
"Don't you know?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," I replied sharply, "and if there is you've no
business to use it." I tried to hide my mounting terror and spoke
as casually as I could. "Well, I'm going off now and, when that
gentleman I told you about arrives, please tell him I thought I'd
better not wait," and I moved off towards the door.</p>

<p>The man's face was a study. He was scowling hard and obviously
in two minds what to do. That he was half intending to stop me I
was sure, but on the other hand he was not quite certain as to
whether I had been bluffing or not when I had said I was
expecting someone else to arrive any moment, and so for the
moment did not dare. At any rate he made no attempt to interfere
with me and let me pass, contenting himself with following
closely after me as I went outside.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;oh, the terror that surged through me again when I
saw what the conditions outside were like. Even in the last few
minutes they had greatly worsened. The mist had deepened and
clung so thickly to the ground that I could only just make out my
feet as I hurried over to the shed where I had left my car. With
a fearful pang I knew that if it got any worse I should have the
greatest difficulty in keeping to the long track leading on to
the high moor road and, in places, the slightest deviation from
it would be disastrous.</p>

<p>Mine must have been the only car which for months had passed
along it and it would be my own wheel ruts which I should have to
follow. There were several quite long stretches along the track
where the ground on either side of it was dangerously boggy and
Heaven help me if I ran the car into them. I knew there would be
no hope of my getting out of them by myself.</p>

<p>However, determining with a brave effort not to meet my
difficulties until I came to them, I hoped for the best, my only
thought now, being to get away from this dreadful seaman.
Anything, I told myself, rather than remain in his company.</p>

<p>Reaching my car, I sprang on to the driver's seat and pressed
upon the self-starter. Nothing happened. It did not turn over the
engine. A little apprehensive I tried again. Still nothing! Next,
I pressed for quite a long time and a dreadful fear filled me
when not only did the engine not start but I felt the current
from the self-starter weakening and actually beginning to die
away. I waited a full minute before trying again. It was just the
same. The battery was almost dead.</p>

<p>And all the time the man had been standing as close to the car
as he could get, with his head half projecting through the window
and his eyes intently watching every movement I made. Upon my
third unsuccessful attempt to start the car, I imagined he drew
in a deep breath of satisfaction. He stepped back a pace or two
and an oily smile replaced the frown upon his face. He eyed me
again in his horrible would-be possessive way.</p>

<p>Now I always take credit that in that dreadful moment of my
life I did not give way to panic and that my expression gave no
indication of the terror I was in, though I was quite aware of
the deadly peril which was now facing me.</p>

<p>There was I with night coming on, in as desolate a place as
anyone could imagine, miles from any other house, alone with a
man whom every womanly instinct in me told me was no whit better
than an animal where his inclinations were concerned. And what
chance was there of any help coming to me? None at all! Even if
anyone were aware of the peril I was in, no one could come to
save me, for, with the fog closing down, it would be impossible
to reach the house, and in a few minutes it would be as if the
man and I were cut off from everyone else in the world.</p>

<p>However, I certainly had one hope left. It might be the car
could yet be started with the handle. I knew I could not swing it
myself, but it was possible the man could and, at any rate, I
would try to bribe him to attempt it.</p>

<p>I jumped out of the car and getting the handle from the back
held it out to him. "Here," I ordered peremptorily, "you start it
with this. It's quite easy and I'll show you how to do it. I'll
give you ten shillings if you do." I spoke quite casually. "I
want to get away quickly now."</p>

<p>But he shook his head and refused to take the handle "Not I,"
he scoffed. "I've heard of its breaking a man's arm." He spoke
with obvious sarcasm. "You'll have to wait until your friend
arrives."</p>

<p>I made no attempt to press him, knowing it would be quite
useless. Instead, I jumped on to the driver's seat again and
pressed upon the self-starter once more. It was deader than ever,
and I gave it up at once. I sat on where I was&mdash;considering.
The one and only hope now of escaping from my enemy was to take
him off his guard and vanish into the fog before he could catch
me. With the fog, as it was, growing denser and denser, I
reckoned a dozen yards start and he would not be able to see to
follow me.</p>

<p>There was one thing, too, greatly in my favour. I knew exactly
where the track began and he didn't. All just round the house the
ground was hard and stony, and the wheel marks of the car could
not be picked up until a good twenty and more yards away.</p>

<p>I looked at the man out of the corner of my eyes. Certainly,
he was lithe and agile looking, but then I knew seamen were never
good runners and that I had another advantage over him there.</p>

<p>I got out of the car. "I'm going into the house," I said. "I
shall wait for my friend there. It's getting much too cold and
damp here." He followed me as close almost as my shadow.</p>

<p>Pulling up one of the chairs I seated myself before the still
smouldering fire, while he took another one and sat and watched
me. We neither of us spoke and in a few moments even the silence
became so unnerving that I wanted to scream. I could feel his
eyes upon me all the time and was sure that if I turned round I
should find him regarding me with that horrible gloating look.
The room began to get darker and darker, and a very few minutes
were as much as I could stand. The time had now come to put
everything to the test.</p>

<p>With a yawn I said as casually as I could. "You had better go
and get something to put on the fire. There are some pieces of
wood in the room at the end of the passage. Also you'll find two
hurricane lamps there. Bring them in and see if you can light
them. There is probably some oil left in them."</p>

<p>But he made no attempt to move. "Plenty of time yet," he
smiled, "and then you can come with me and show me where
everything is. It is still quite warm here and&mdash;" but he
suddenly stopped speaking and turned his head round in the
attitude of one who had heard something.</p>

<p>For the moment I heard nothing and then upon my startled and
amazed ears fell the faint sound of the chug-chugging of a
distant motor bicycle. My heart almost stopped beating. It was
impossible! It could not be one!</p>

<p>The seaman was as incredulous as was I, and with his mouth
opened wide and his eyes almost bulging from his head, sat still
as death to listen.</p>

<p>The chugging stopped for a few seconds, but came on again and
continued in jerks. There was no doubt about it. It was a motor
bicycle and the rider was evidently coming very slowly to keep to
the track.</p>

<p>Oh, the exultation in my heart! It was like being reprieved
from a most horrible form of death. I sprang to my feet and ran,
followed closely as before by the seaman, to the open door. The
chugs were much louder now. Louder and louder they came and then
through the fog, to me like an angel from Heaven, burst the
muffled and be-goggled figure of a man upon his machine.</p>

<p>He caught sight of us at once and riding straight up to us,
pulled up and dropped the motor-cycle on to its stand. Next, with
a flourish he pulled off his goggles and with one hand brushed
away the moisture from his eyes. Looking up at last, his eyes met
mine and I gasped in amazement.</p>

<p>The man was Gilbert Larose.</p>


<hr>


<h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.<br>

THE CURTAIN FALLS.</h2>

<p class="first">NOW if I were astonished at the so dramatic
appearance of Larose, his face was the very picture of
amazement, too.</p>

<p>"You, here?" he asked incredulously, "It's really you."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's me!" I choked. "It's really me!"</p>

<p>He was evidently about to ask further questions, but
apparently seeing I was upon the verge of tears, turned tactfully
to the seaman who was standing beside me. "Good afternoon," he
said, "or considering how late it is, perhaps I had better make
it good evening!"</p>

<p>The man's face was as black as thunder. "No, Ingleesh," he
scowled, shaking his head vigorously, whereupon Larose turned
back to me. "Who is he?" he asked curiously.</p>

<p>With a great effort I steadied my voice. "He's a Spanish
seaman just off a Plymouth boat," I said. I went on hurriedly.
"He's a horrible man. I met him on the road this afternoon and he
followed me here. My battery has run down and he wouldn't help me
start the car, so that&mdash;" I was trembling like a
leaf&mdash;"I should be compelled to spend the night alone with
him. I am terrified of him."</p>

<p>The face of Larose hardened. "Oh, that's it, is it?" he said.
He nodded. "Well, you'll be all right now."</p>

<p>"But you look out," I went on breathlessly. "Don't let him get
behind you. I'm sure he's dangerous. I'll tell you everything
presently."</p>

<p>"Good," said Larose. "I'll watch him,"&mdash;he made a motion
with his arm to the man to precede him into the house&mdash;"but
first, I'll bring this machine of mine into the passage. This
dampness will be doing it no good." He turned to look at the fog.
"Whew, isn't it thick now? I only got here just in time."</p>

<p>"Yes, only just in time," I said brokenly. "In another few
minutes I was going to rush out to try to escape somehow." I
shivered. "Anything rather than be alone with this man any
longer."</p>

<p>Larose looked at me compassionately. "Poor girl," he smiled,
"you seem to have been having a bad time, but don't worry. It's
all over now." Entering the big kitchen, he became practical.
"But this is awful," he said. "Can't we unearth some sort of
light anywhere?"</p>

<p>"There are two hurricane lanterns in a room up the passage," I
said, "and they may have some oil in them. Then there are several
broken packing-cases and we can get the wood to put on the fire.
There may some coal left, too, in the cellar."</p>

<p>"Ah, the fire!" he exclaimed. He pointed to the big heap of
ashes and smiled. "That's your work, I expect, burning all the
books and papers that were here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I was here alone by myself for a long time before this
man came," I said. I turned the conversation. "But let's go after
those lamps and that wood before it gets quite dark. We must take
the man with us to help carry them. I tell you I'm sure he's
dangerous and you mustn't let him out of your sight for one
second. He must be furious that you've come." My voice began to
choke again. "He was so positive that he'd get me in his power
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that now," broke in Larose. "You can tell me
about it later." He looked back at the seaman. "But it'll be a
job to make him understand what he's got to do, won't it?"</p>

<p>I shook my head. "No, he speaks French and so do I," I said,
and I turned to the seaman and told him what he had to do. To my
surprise, he was now all smiles and amiable and readily agreed to
help us. So the wood and lamps were brought in and to my delight
we found there was plenty of oil left in the containers of the
latter. I sent the man down into the cellar to look for coal and
he returned with a good armful. "Plenty more there," he grinned,
"enough to last us a month or two."</p>

<p>With the lamps burning and a good fire blazing up, the kitchen
soon began to take on a more cheerful outlook. "But," asked
Larose with a sly smile, "how long do you think this fog may
last?"</p>

<p>I made no pretence of having no opinion, but replied readily
enough. "If it were winter," I said, "it might last for a week,
but at this time of the year it is quite likely to have all
cleared off by the morning. But still, that's only guess-work,
for one can never be certain of anything up here."</p>

<p>"Well, about food," said Larose. "I've got a few things in my
carrier, as I'm really upon a camping-holiday. I've got some
bread rolls, a little butter, some cheese and two tins of corned
beef." He looked as happy as a schoolboy. "Also, I dare say it
will please you that I've got condensed milk, tea and a good old
Australian billy to brew it up in."</p>

<p>"And I've got biscuits," I said, "some chocolate and a bag of
apples."</p>

<p>"Good," said Larose, "then we can have quite a satisfactory
meal." He looked towards the seaman. "But what about our
ugly-looking friend here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, at any rate he's got bread and cheese," I said, "as he
was having a meal off them when I first met him. Also, he must
have some spirits in his knapsack, as he smells horribly of
them."</p>

<p>So the food was brought out and we had quite a merry meal,
with the seaman sharing one of the tins of beef. Also, the latter
produced a good-sized flask of rum nearly full, and offered it
round. However, it was declined with thanks and so he himself
proceeded to drink generously.</p>

<p>The meal over, Larose said smilingly, "Now, I think Mrs. Fane,
that you owe me some explanation. Don't you think so, too?"</p>

<p>"What about?" I asked innocently.</p>

<p>"Firstly," he replied, "why you told us an untruth when you
said you had never met that Caesar Sturm before you met him at
the race-meeting at Lewes; and secondly, why are you so anxious
that no one should know you lived in this house at the time when
that Colonel Jasper was here, and thirdly, why you thought it
necessary to make the long journey to here just to destroy all
those old papers."</p>

<p>"And why do you want to know all these things?" I asked. "They
can have nothing whatever to do with how that man came to meet
his death. You know quite well I could have had no part in
that."</p>

<p>"I know that," he agreed, "but still"&mdash;he shrugged his
shoulders&mdash;"well, I suppose it was mostly curiosity that
prompted me to break my journey here this afternoon. As I've just
said I am upon holiday now and, crossing over the moor, I thought
it worth while to come a little out of my way to see what I could
find out." He laughed. "You see I hate being beaten, Mrs. Fane,
and you know you and Mrs. Hume have certainly beaten us in more
than one thing, so much so that my good friend Inspector Stone is
still like a bear with a sore head whenever he thinks of either
of you."</p>

<p>"And if I tell you," I asked, "how are you going to use your
knowledge?"</p>

<p>"I'm not going to use it at all," he said quickly. "As far as
Scotland Yard is concerned, I promise you the whole matter of the
medium's death is closed. Against all our instincts to the
contrary, we are now regarding it as having been an accident from
the shooting of one of those undiscovered rabbiters." He spoke
with the utmost earnestness.</p>

<p>"So, anything you tell me now, upon my honour, I assure you is
quite off the record."</p>

<p>"Then part of what you want to know I'll tell you," I said. "I
spoke the truth in telling you that when I was introduced to
Caesar Sturm at Lewes I had no idea we had ever met before. But
that afternoon when he followed me into the lane to speak to me I
learnt I was wrong. When I was living here&mdash;I'll have to
admit that&mdash;he arrived one night and was given shelter in a
storm. He knew that Colonel Jasper had a valuable collection of
gold coins and a few weeks later he came to steal them. He tried
first to poison some savage Alsatian dogs we had here, but it
didn't come off and he had to bolt for his life when that Colonel
Jasper went after him with a rifle."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it, is it?" commented Larose. "And you must have
been quite a young girl then?"</p>

<p>"Just over sixteen," I nodded.</p>

<p>"But why are you so anxious no one should know you lived
here," asked Larose, "and why was that so-called Caesar Sturm so
wanting to find out what had been your position in the
household?" He eyed me very intently. "Tell me, strictly between
ourselves, was Colonel Jasper your father?"</p>

<p>I had to laugh and I think Larose realised my laughter was
genuine. "Certainly not," I said, "though I don't think he would
have been fonder of me if he had been." I spoke pleadingly. "Look
here, Mr. Larose, I want my little secret there to remain mine
only and I assure you that if I told you everything you would
only be amused."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," smiled Larose. "I'll let it go at that, but
now about your adventures in Paris? What had he found out about
you there?"</p>

<p>"Really, actually nothing," I said, "but he had somehow
stumbled upon a half-truth and might have made my life a misery
by the blackmail he was threatening me with, if he had lived to
carry out his threat. I admit frankly that it was a mercy for me
that he died when he did."</p>

<p>"Now one more question," said Larose and he spoke with the
utmost sternness. "On your honour, have you any idea how that man
came to die? Did your sister-in-law have anything whatever to do
with his death?"</p>

<p>I spoke as solemnly and emphatically as I could. "Upon my
honour, no, Mr. Larose. She was as horrified as I was at the
scandal and suspicion which fell upon us all. I am positive she
is as much in the dark as we all are."</p>

<p>"All right," said Larose. "I believe you." He smiled a rather
sly smile. "But, another thing. Does your husband know you were
coming here today?"</p>

<p>I know I must have looked horrified at the idea. "No, no," I
cried, "he doesn't know anything about it and though I know he
would never believe anything wrong about me, I am sure he would
feel very hurt if he came to learn I was keeping anything back
from him. The family and I happen to be staying about thirty
miles from here, but he has had to go up to Scotland and will not
be with us again until tomorrow evening. Then, in a foolish
moment, I thought I would come here and burn all these papers. If
I get back before tomorrow evening everything will be all right
and he will never know."</p>

<p>"And you'll be back by then," said Larose confidently. "I'll
see to that." He turned the conversation. "And now about this new
friend of yours who's been staring so hard at us all the time
we've been talking. I certainly don't like his looks, but why
does he so frighten you?"</p>

<p>I told Larose about our meeting on the moor road and how he
had scared me from the very first moment. "He began looking at me
at once in a horrible way," I choked, "my legs, my body and every
part of me. He kept on thrusting himself so close to me, too,
that every moment I was terrified he was going to catch hold of
me. I hadn't been with him for five minutes either before he
leered at me that he loved pretty girls and petted them every
time he got the chance. Every instinct in me told me he was a man
it was unsafe for any woman to be alone with and he kept looking
up and down the lonely road in a way that made me feel sick with
fright. Except for that one charabanc nothing passed us all the
time."</p>

<p>"And when he came here," frowned Larose, "he didn't actually
attempt to molest you?"</p>

<p>"No, because I had told him I was expecting a friend to arrive
every moment," I said, "and he didn't quite know whether to
believe me or not. But, when the fog was getting thicker and
thicker every minute and he saw I couldn't start the car, he
refused to help me and looked so gloating and triumphant about it
that I felt as I were going to faint in my fright. Then
I&mdash;-" but suddenly I felt ashamed of myself and asked
falteringly, "But do you think I was a fool imagining
everything?"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "No, I don't," he said very gravely.
"On the contrary I think you were in as dreadful a position as
any woman could be. I know this fellow's type well. We see such a
lot like him down at the London Docks, hot-blooded
Latin-Americans who are all what you say. Sex-starved upon their
long voyages, they are like animals when they get on shore. They
are always getting into fights, too, about their women. Life's
cheap where they come from and, upon very little provocation,
they whip out their knives." He looked at the Spaniard out of the
corner of his eyes. "I'll bet he's got one tucked away
somewhere."</p>

<p>"He has," I said fearfully, "and its like a dagger. He was
cutting his bread with it when I first met him."</p>

<p>"But don't be frightened," said Larose. "He won't get up to
any tricks now I'm here. As a rule, his class of men are not
dangerous until their tempers are roused."</p>

<p>We talked on for a long while and I found Larose a most
agreeable companion, realising, too, that he was one of those men
whom you can trust absolutely. I thought that of all the men I
knew I couldn't wish for a better protector than I had now. When
he decided it was about time for us to try to get some sleep, he
fetched the seat from my car and, with the big rug which I always
took about with me from there, too, made me quite a
comfortable-looking bed in the passage.</p>

<p>"You shall sleep here," he said, "and the man and I will be in
the kitchen. I'll make a bed on two chairs and he'll have to pass
me to get at you. So you'll be quite alright." He frowned, "I
don't think I shall attempt to go to sleep, as the fine gentleman
seems to be rather funny tonight. He's been too quiet for my
liking. He's evidently been thinking a lot." He nodded, "I wonder
what about."</p>

<p>I laid down and, making myself as comfortable as I could,
closed my eyes, not expecting, however, to get any sleep. I had
been through so much anxiety during the day and my nerves were in
such a state of tension that I thought sleep would be quite
impossible.</p>

<p>I heard the others in the kitchen getting ready, as I thought
for bed; on Larose's part a scraping of the chairs and on the
seaman's the plumping down somewhere of the heavy boots he
announced earlier to me that he was going to take off to ease his
aching feet. Then a deep intense silence filled the house. From
where I was lying I could not see into the kitchen, but the
flickering shadows upon the wall of the passage told me the fire
was still burning well. Larose had said he was not certain how
long the oil in the hurricane lamps would hold out and so was
going to keep a bright fire to enable him to keep a good watch
upon his companion.</p>

<p>The minutes passed and I began to feel drowsy, my thoughts
became the less and less coherent and, hours sooner than I had
expected, I dropped into a heavy and coma-like sleep.</p>

<p>As I learnt later I must have slept nearly three hours, and
then a dream came into my sleep, as dreadful and vivid a dream as
I ever remember, before or since.</p>

<p>Sakao, the wolf, was chasing me, and as when too exhausted to
run a step further, I turned to face him, I saw he was about to
spring at my throat. The fur upon his neck was bristling, his
eyes were shining like balls of fire and with his mouth wide open
and dripping froth I saw the huge fangs which were about to tear
the life out of me.</p>

<p>I gave a shrill scream of terror and it was my own scream
which woke me.</p>

<p>Then with all my senses still half-drugged from sleep, upon my
startled ears came a succession of crashing sounds from the
kitchen. It seemed that chairs were being flung about, that the
hurricane lamp had been thrown on to the floor and more
horrifying than all, I heard a cry from Larose, followed by a
snarling shout of triumph which I knew could have only come from
the seaman.</p>

<p>For only a very few seconds did I seem to lose my presence of
mind and then I threw off the rug which covered me and darted
like an arrow into the kitchen. The room itself was half in
darkness as the hurricane was lying extinguished somewhere upon
the floor and there was only the flickering light of the fire
which enabled me to see what was happening, but what I did see
made me feel sick with terror.</p>

<p>With all his watchful intentions, I realised Larose must have
fallen asleep to be awakened by my scream and find himself in
deadly peril. I took in everything in a lightning glance.</p>

<p>Larose was prone upon his back on the floor. The seaman was
astride his chest, with one hand pinioning his right arm to the
floor and with the other endeavouring to plunge the large and
dagger shaped knife into his throat. But Larose had caught the
man's wrist there and was holding it away, though it was only an
inch or two from piercing the flesh.</p>

<p>I did not hesitate an instant, but spring forward seized the
seaman's long hair with both my hands and tugged fiercely to pull
his head back. The muscles of his neck were like bars of steel
and I did not quite succeed in my effort. Still, the fury of my
tugging undoubtedly unbalanced him, as Larose was able to slant
the dagger away from menacing his throat. Then with a lightning
movement of his wrist he twisted the man's arm right round until
the dagger point now threatened him.</p>

<p>Some spasmodic gasps on both sides and then, still grasped
convulsively in the man's own hand, with a mighty effort Larose
forced the dagger upwards to plunge deeply into the man's own
throat.</p>

<p>It was all over in a few seconds. The man gave a dreadful
gurgling squeal and the blood gushed in torrents from the wound
as he crumpled up like a limp rag. Larose flung the body away
from him and sprang to his feet. His first thought was for
me.</p>

<p>"Don't look," he ordered hoarsely. "You get out of this. Go
back into the passage," and I obeyed him instantly. I flung
myself down on my improvised bed, and for a minute or two was
sure I was going to be violently sick. My heart was beating like
a sledge hammer, and I pressed hard upon my eyes with fingers to
shut out what I had seen.</p>

<p>However, gradually I calmed down and was able to take in what
was going on in the kitchen. Larose had succeeded in relighting
the lamp, and I could hear him moving softly about the room. I
heard him go out into the other passage and, as he trod heavily
and slowly I guessed he was taking the body of the seaman away. I
had no doubt about the man being dead.</p>

<p>Next I heard a splashing of water in the sink&mdash;Larose
seemed to be quite a long time there&mdash;and then came a long
silence. At last Larose put his head round the kitchen door. "You
can come in now, Mrs. Fane," he said gently. "There's nothing to
distress you. I've taken it away."</p>

<p>I walked unsteadily into the kitchen, where the fire was
burning brightly again. Larose came up close to me, and feeling
for my hand, took it and held it, looking down at me very
intently with eyes that I guessed were moist with tears.</p>

<p>"Thank you, so very much, Mrs. Fane," he said softly. "I won't
say more, but I know you will understand." He pressed my hand
tenderly, but then let it go with a jerk and turned his eyes away
and sighed.</p>

<p>Tears welled up into my eyes. I wanted to cry and, much as I
loved my husband, would have liked to have buried my head on
Larose's shoulder. I am sure he sensed the emotional stress I was
in, for he reached out again and took my hand. He lifted it to
his lips. "My first and last kiss, Marie." He bowed. "From now on
always your most devoted slave. You are one of the bravest women
I have ever met," and he dropped my hand again as abruptly as he
had done before.</p>

<p>"But I'm not really brave," I said, "I think it was temper
more than anything that made me seize his hair. I was furious to
think that he had got the better of you."</p>

<p>"And, indeed, he had," said Larose solemnly. "It was a
dreadful thing my going off to sleep." A thought struck him. "But
how on earth did you come to give me that warning scream. From
where you were lying you couldn't have seen into here."</p>

<p>"I didn't," I said and I told him what had happened.</p>

<p>"Well, it came exactly at the right moment," he said, "as it
gave me that split second to roll off my chairs before he was
upon me." He laughed. "And your pulling his hair was a master
stroke. You could have done nothing better. No kicks or blows
such as you could have given him would have been any use." He
pointed to a chair. "Now you sit down and we'll talk things over.
First, here are what I found in his pockets."</p>

<p>"That's the ten shilling note I gave him," I said with a
shudder at the recollection of my meeting him on the high moor
road.</p>

<p>"Well, that and these few shillings were all the money he
had," said Larose, "So we can understand why he was interested in
the roll of notes you let him see in your bag. Now, here's a
discharge in Plymouth from the steamer <i>Janeeta</i> exactly a
week ago of a fireman Carlos Vasco, so we can be pretty sure that
was his name. And here's another name, Philip Vasco, of 17, River
Lane, Bristol. That of course is the fisherman brother whom he
told you he was going to see."</p>

<p>"Oh, burn everything," I said impatiently, "so that his body
will never be able to be identified."</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "I'm afraid we can't hope that, Mrs.
Fane," he said. He spoke very solemnly. "We are in a very awkward
position, for it looks as if there is going to be a lot of
publicity about the death of this man. I hate to tell you, but I
don't see how you can escape being brought into it, too."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why," I exclaimed with a dreadful fear beginning to
surge up into me, "I was certain that you'd leave him here to be
discovered by the next person who came to the house, which
mightn't be perhaps for years and years. No one could ever learn
then who'd come here with him."</p>

<p>Larose shook his head again. "But I'm afraid it's not going to
be as easy as that," he said, and he took a key out of his pocket
and held it up for me to see. "Yesterday I went to the
house-agent in Torquay and, as a possible purchaser, borrowed
this to look over the place. Worse even than that, the man said
he himself was coming out here very shortly to see how the roof
was standing up to the rough weather." He made a grimace. "So you
see that anyhow I am in it up to the neck, and will have to tell
the police."</p>

<p>His words broke upon my astounded ears like a thunderclap. My
mind had been so filled with relief at the thought that the
seaman was dead that I had given no thought at all about anything
else. Now the awful possibilities of what might be going to
happen made me gasp in my dismay.</p>

<p>"Then my husband and everyone will learn that I came here?" I
exclaimed wildly. "This secret of mine which I want no one to
know will become known everywhere and broadcast in the
newspapers."</p>

<p>I burst into tears at last. "I would rather that vile man had
killed me."</p>

<p>Larose was obviously upset at my distress. "You know I'd make
any sacrifice I could," he said earnestly, "if it would be the
slightest good to you in any way"&mdash;he frowned&mdash;"even if
I had to perjure myself, but I can't think of anything I could
say or do to help you."</p>

<p>"But couldn't you leave me out altogether," I wailed, "and
make no mention of having seen me here?"</p>

<p>"I could," he replied at once, "but the police won't do it.
Directly they learn of the way this man met his death they are
bound to want to question you, as probably the last person except
me to see him alive. Then, when they see your wheel-marks to and
from this house, they'll be intensely curious to know what you
were doing here in this lonely place all by yourself, if you gave
the man a lift here or if he followed you against your wishes. If
we make any mystery of anything they'll suspect something at
once."</p>

<p>"But how will they ever be able to learn," I asked petulantly,
"about me ever having set eyes upon the man at all?"</p>

<p>"You forget the charabanc of tourists," he said very gravely,
"which went by when he was helping you to change your wheel, and
aren't both of you people to be remembered?" He smiled sadly.
"Beauty and the beast! You, a prepossessingly young woman all by
yourself with your fine-looking expensive car and he a repulsive
mahogany-faced foreigner with earrings and long hair! Why,
directly the story of the horrible form of death a Scotland Yard
detective had to give him to save his own life becomes
known&mdash;the story will be red-hot news for the sensational
newspapers and everyone will be talking about it. Then don't you
think some of those charabanc people will go rushing to the
police and say, 'Oh, yes, I saw him talking with a pretty girl in
her car not far from the house where that detective must have
stabbed him?'"</p>

<p>"But how will they find me?" I quavered. "I left no traces
coming here that they can pick up."</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Fane," said Larose with a deep sigh, "you began
to leave the clearest of traces in the first village you passed
leaving Exeter. As I have said, a woman such as you in a car such
as yours would be remarked upon everywhere when you were on the
road, particularly in the comparatively slack time in the middle
of the week." A sudden thought seemed to strike him and he asked
sharply. "What about Chudleigh? You say your car was in the local
garage there for upward of two hours, then was there anything in
it that would give any clue as to whom you are, even if they
didn't take the car number which they usually do?"</p>

<p>My stomach heaved over in my fright. "My driving-licence was
in one of the pockets," I faltered, "and I think I had left some
of my visiting-cards in a pigeon-hole on the dashboard."</p>

<p>Larose made no comment and went on, "Then, when they take the
finger-marks in these rooms they'll find hundreds of yours, many
many more than you can find now and wipe away. They'll see
they're a woman's at once and, directly they have identified them
as yours, they'll know you passed a long, long time in the house,
and guess, probably that you stayed the night here." He shrugged
his shoulders despondently and asked. "So what can I do? If I
attempt to leave you out I should create a mystery and that will
make the whole trouble a hundred times worse."</p>

<p>Then to Larose's obvious astonishment, he could see that all
of a sudden I was smiling. Still, he would have thought that the
smile was a forced one, as my hands were shaking like a gambler
who was about to make his last throw with the dice.</p>

<p>"Mr. Larose," I said quietly, "I take you to be a brave man
and, more than that, one who is not afraid to take risks."</p>

<p>Larose frowned. He told me afterwards that he wondered what on
earth was coming. However, he made no comment.</p>

<p>I went on speaking quickly because I was upon tenterhooks to
get over what I had to say. "Now there is quite an easy way out
of all this," I said, "quite a simple one which was tried once
many years ago and proved quite successful." I held his eyes with
mine. "But, first, I shall have to be more frank with you than I
have been up to now and keep nothing back. I have told you that,
when that man I was to know later as Caesar Sturm came here after
Colonel Jasper's gold coins, he didn't succeed in getting them,
as the Colonel drove him away with a hail of bullets from his
rifle."</p>

<p>"And that was true?" asked Larose, because I had stopped
speaking to get my breath.</p>

<p>"Quite true," I nodded, "but I should have added that he came
with another man who was not so fortunate in getting away. He did
not return home and is still here?"</p>

<p>"What?" queried Larose with his eyes opened very widely.</p>

<p>I shook my head. "No," I said with my voice trembling, "he had
his throat torn out. Unbeknown to anyone in the district, Colonel
Jasper was keeping a pet wolf here and he set him on to him.
Caesar Sturm ran back to try to save him, but he was too late,
though he killed the wolf."</p>

<p>"And you saw it all?" asked Larose with horrified eyes. "What
a dreadful secret for a young girl to have to keep!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I was not much more than sixteen at the time," I
said, "and that wretched Sturm brought everything up so vividly
at the s&eacute;ance I thought it was the genuine spirit of the
dead man which had come into the room. Do you wonder it upset
me?"</p>

<p>In reply Larose reached his hand across the table and laid it
gently upon one of mine. The kind and sympathetic smile which
accompanied this action made it easier all at once for what more
I was intending to say.</p>

<p>"Well," I began in matter of fact tones, "Colonel Jasper found
himself then in exactly the same difficulty we are in now. Living
in this lonely house so far away from all help, he dreaded the
publicity his valuable gold coins would get and how it might
suggest to others to come after them. And another thing&mdash;he
knew the fearful censure which would fall upon him for having, in
a farming district like this, kept a tame wolf here. The animal
had escaped upon several nights from his cage and killed quite a
number of sheep. He had been seen by lots of people but they had
never been close enough to recognise him as a wolf. So, with
these difficulties confronting him, Colonel
Jasper&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did what you are now going to suggest I should do," broke in
Larose with an ominous shake of his head&mdash;"say nothing to
the police and give this man's body a private burial somewhere in
a lonely part of the moor, trusting to good fortune the place may
never be discovered." He frowned. "But I don't like these private
burial grounds, Mrs. Fane, as all the annals of crime tell us
that when a killer gives the body of his victim to the earth she
has so often proved a most unwilling ally. So many times she has
seemed to be on the side of the Law and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I am not going to suggest anything as clumsy as burial,"
I broke in in my turn. "No, Colonel Jasper just threw the body
into an almost unfathomable bog near here and it disappeared for
ever. This bog is Fowler's Bog and it's the deepest and most
dangerous on the whole moor-side. It never gives up anything that
gets into it. The man who lived in this house before the Colonel
slipped into it and was never seen again. Lots of moor ponies all
known to have been lost there and some have actually been seen
sinking down."</p>

<p>Larose looked incredulous. "And you mean to tell me," he
asked, "that bodies falling into it disappear at once and never
rise to the surface again?"</p>

<p>"No, not at once," I said. "They take from twenty minutes to
half an hour for the bog to finally close over them and then they
lie hidden deep down under the mud and peat for ever and
ever."</p>

<p>"But it's against all reason," objected Larose. "When they
putrefy the gases of putrefaction must force them to the surface
again."</p>

<p>"But they don't putrefy," I said sharply. "It is well known
that peat has some preservative qualities and no gasses are
formed."</p>

<p>"And how big is this bog?" asked Larose thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"More than half a mile long and some hundreds of yards broad
and this end begins just behind Black Tor, a huge tor which when
the fog clears you'll see about a quarter of a mile away from
here. A wide ledge of the tor hangs over the bog for about ten
feet and that's where the bodies were dropped over. The man's
body and that of the wolf went together. I'll show you the exact
spot tomorrow. About a year later one of the big Alsatians, too,
became so sick that Colonel Jasper had to shoot it and it was
thrown in at the same spot. The Colonel was so overcome with
grief that he couldn't wait to see it disappear, but I did and,
as I say, it took about twenty minutes."</p>

<p>Larose considered for quite a long time and then said, "But
one thing I don't understand. About that man the wolf
killed&mdash;why didn't his companion, go at once to the police
and tell them what had happened?"</p>

<p>"He daren't," I replied, "and we knew we were quite safe
there. When he had come here the first time, that night of the
storm when he had lost his way, after he had gone I remembered
him as a man whom I had overheard someone in the village of Bovey
Tracey say had recently served a sentence of penal servitude for
burglary. Then if he had gone to the police what account could he
have given them for he and his companion having been up here to
throw poison to our dogs in the dead of night? No, we didn't
expect any trouble and it followed we didn't get any either."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, of course," nodded Larose, "I was forgetting all
about Bellamy being known to the police."</p>

<p>A long silence ensued and then I asked anxiously. "Have you
any scruples about getting rid of the body in that way, if you
don't think it will be found out?"</p>

<p>"None whatever," he smiled, "as it would do nobody any harm
and that's how I would <i>always</i> judge matters like that. I
was only considering if the idea were really feasible and I must
think it well over before I decide anything." He looked at his
watch. "But come, we'll sleep on it, young lady. We can have a
good two hours, and then, with the first breaking of the dawn, if
our good fortune is in and the fog has cleared a bit, you shall
take me to this dreadful bog and I will make up my mind at
once."</p>

<p>And the fog did clear and soon after dawn the high gaunt pile
of Black Tor was visible from the house. I led Larose to behind
it and pointed out the exact spot where the bodies had been
thrown in. For a long minute he regarded the black oily surface
of the bog and then, to my immense relief, exclaimed cheerfully,
"Yes, I'll risk it, though the consequences will be terrible if
you've misled me and the body doesn't disappear as completely as
you say."</p>

<p>We went back to the house and he set me clearing up as far as
possible, all traces of our having been there. With the seaman's
body he would allow me to have nothing to do, and indeed I never
would set eyes upon it again. Finding a derelict old wheelbarrow
in one of the sheds he made use of it to cart the body away. He
was gone a good hour and the sun was beginning to come through
the mist when he returned.</p>

<p>"All right so far," he announced, "it disappeared in just over
the twenty minutes you gave it."</p>

<p>He made short work of starting my car and on his motor-bicycle
preceded me up the track towards the high road. "I'll go first,"
he said, "to make certain the road is clear. Then I'll go Bovey
Tracey way, while you'll turn in the opposite direction. Make a
wide detour round and don't go through any of the villages you
passed when coming here. Get into Exeter by the Okehampton
road."</p>

<p>"And how can I get in touch with you later on?" he asked. He
grinned impishly. "As a fellow criminal, I can keep you wise as
to anything moving in Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>"You can always phone me," I said, "my husband is not the
least bit inquisitive and never wants to know who is ringing me
up?"</p>

<p>"Good," he said, "and I'd like to meet him one day if we can
arrange it somehow." He smiled all over his face. "It would be
interesting to see the lucky man who owns this lively piece of
goods who holds so many secrets in her pretty little head."</p>

<p>We shook hands warmly in parting and in an assumption of
affection called each other by our christian names. Obeying his
instructions, I made a wide detour round and reached home in
plenty of time to meet my husband who arrived by the afternoon
train.</p>

<p>In one way I felt very ashamed of myself and, in another way,
I didn't. My love was all for my husband and the great deception
of my life in no way detracted from my worthiness as his wife.
So, I would forget it all, I told myself, and harrow my
conscience no more about it.</p>

<p>And now I come to what I am sure I shall always regard as the
very greatest surprise of my whole life, and it was avalanched
upon me without a second's warning. It came about six months
after my dreadful adventure with the Spanish seaman. David and I
had accepted a very short notice invitation to dinner from Clara.
We were in Town and she rang up from her flat.</p>

<p>"Frank and his wife are coming," she said, "and we want you
two to make up a table for bridge. You know she doesn't play and
so I shall sit out with her."</p>

<p>Frank was the Eastbourne Dr. Burton and I had noticed she
always made a great fuss of him. I liked him very much, too, for
he was always such a bright-natured young fellow and so full of
fun. Indeed, I had once said laughingly to Clara that if only it
had happened I had met him before I had her brother I would
probably have become Mrs. Burton, and she had commented that it
was quite likely, as anyone could see he was half in love with me
now.</p>

<p>She told me over the phone to be sure and come early as she
had something very important that she wanted to tell me before
the others arrived. Accordingly we arrived in good time and she
took me into her own little room and rather shocked me by
announcing abruptly that Anton Meynall was dead.</p>

<p>Three days previously she had a message from him from the
Eastbourne Hospital to ask her to go to see him. He was in the
last stages of leukaemia, that dreadful incurable disease, and
knew his death could be only a matter of days. He had wanted to
express to her for the last time his great grief at the way he
had behaved to me.</p>

<p>The news was certainly a shock, but I did not for a moment
pretend that I was sorry, for the haunting thought had always
been with me that one day he and David might have somehow met and
he, in an uncontrolled agony of contrition have burst out
something which might have started David questioning me.</p>

<p>However, now I discussed Anton's death very shortly with her,
just saying what a relief it always was to my conscience that he
had not been able to carry out the dreadful crime I had been
urging him to.</p>

<p>"And what another great relief to me it would be," I went on,
"if we could only be sure that the death of that wretch in the
lane was the accident we all think it to be. I am always a little
bit afraid that one day Inspector Stone will come jumping round
with something else he's found out about you or me."</p>

<p>"No chance of that, Marie, dear," said Clara smilingly, "as
there is nothing more to be found out."</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't there?" I said sharply. "What about who fired the
actual shot? Can you tell me that?"</p>

<p>All on the instant the smile passed from Clara's face and she
regarded me with the utmost solemnity. "Yes, I can," she said,
speaking very slowly, "though I'd never dare to tell anybody
else. But I'm not afraid of telling you and many times have
thought of doing so." She looked round to make sure the door was
closed before almost whispering her next words. "I killed him and
it was only through Dr. Burton that I was saved. He changed the
bullets at the post-mortem and gave the police a different one
which could not have been fired from my rifle."</p>

<p>I stood aghast. Clara a murderess! And she had sworn to me so
solemnly that she had not killed him! Clara whose word I had
thought, too, that I could always rely upon as never being
anything but the truth!</p>

<p>She coloured up and reached impulsively for my hand. "No,
Marie, darling, I did not lie to you when you asked me if I had
deliberately shot the man and I assured you solemnly I had not.
The quibble was about the word 'deliberate' which you had used.
My killing him was not deliberate. It was purely accidental. He
was menacing me. I was holding the rifle in defence and it seemed
to go off by itself. I'd swear I never pressed on the trigger."
She pointed to a chair. "But sit down, dear, and I'll tell you
everything quickly. I must be quick as the others may be here any
minute now."</p>

<p>I sat down as ordered and she went on. "That afternoon,
directly Sturm returned from his drive he came running up the
lane looking about everywhere for his cigarette case, just as I
had got a big crow before the sights of my rifle, and that made
me angrier than ever with him. I ordered him to leave the Court
instantly, as an unwholesome sexual beast. He was furious and
said it was not because of that girl I was wanting to get him
into trouble, but because you had come sneaking to me about what
he had found out about you. He called you a vile word and said
that by shielding you I was probably one, too. Then he advanced
close and I pointed the rifle at him in self-defence&mdash;and it
went off."</p>

<p>Her voice shook. "Imagine the state of terror I was in, as
like a flash of lightning, I realised everyone would say I had
done it on purpose. Then, as in another flash of lightning, all
my terror passed from me when I heard the report of a rifle being
fired in that quarry across the road. If I said nothing it would
be thought he had been killed by that rifle over there! Then it
would be considered his death had been an accident. I calmed down
instantly and putting my rifle back in the summerhouse, walked as
casually as I could back into the house."</p>

<p>She smiled wanly. "I felt quite safe until those few minutes
later, upon my husband's orders I had run for Dr. Burton and
stood panting before him. Then I realised for the first time what
a fool I was, as of course the police would be able to tell that
the bullet which killed Sturm had come from my rifle. I blurted
out everything to Frank in a fierce rush of words and he was
terribly shocked. Then, as we were running back to the Court, he
ordered me to admit everything immediately, as the longer I put
it off the worse it would look for me. Then I sobbed out that you
might be dragged into a horrible scandal, too, as Sturm had been
making out he knew something dreadful about you, and people would
say I had shot him on purpose to close his mouth. That seemed to
upset Frank more than ever. Then, to my amazement, just as we
came in sight of where Robert was waiting for us by the body, he
said sharply, 'No, continue on saying nothing, I will make things
quite safe for you. I shall be doing the post-mortem tomorrow and
I'll change your bullet for another one I have. It's in a hare
which the Vicar gave me. He shot it yesterday with a rifle the
same size as yours!'"</p>

<p>Clara smiled brightly. "And that's why, Marie dear, I've
always felt so safe. I was so sure nothing could ever be brought
home to me."</p>

<p>"But Clara," I asked incredulously, "how was it Dr. Burton was
willing to take such a risk for you. If it had been found out the
consequences would have been dreadful for him. Of course I know
you are great friends but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We are far more than great friends," she said earnestly. She
dropped her voice again to a whisper and her whisper was a very
solemn and tender one. "He is my dearly beloved son, Marie, the
child of that slip I told you I made when I was only
sixteen."</p>

<p>"My God," I exclaimed, more astounded than ever, "does he know
it?"</p>

<p>"You old goose," she laughed, "of course he does, and so would
do anything for his foolish old mother." She lifted a hand
warningly. "But hark! There goes the bell! They've arrived!" She
patted me affectionately upon the cheek. "Now never you worry any
more about Inspector Stone. He can harm neither of us now." Her
face was all smiles. "And, after what you know Frank did for us,
you be extra nice to him tonight. He's going to take you in to
dinner."</p>
