  <h2>I. &mdash; A SOCIETY SCANDAL</h2>

  <p class="first">Tall and burly, with features and skin hardened by exposure
  to the sun and winds of many climates, he looked like a man ready to face all
  hardships, equal to any emergency. Already one seemed to see the clothes and
  habits of civilization falling away from him, the former to be replaced by
  the stern, unlovely outfit of the war correspondent who plays the game. They
  crowded round him in the club smoking room, for these were his last few
  minutes. They had dined him, toasted him, and the club loving cup had been
  drained to his success and his safe return. For Lovell was a popular member
  of this very Bohemian gathering, and he was going to the Far East, at a few
  hours' notice, to represent one of the greatest of English dailies.</p>

  <p>A pale, slight young man, who stood at this right hand, was speaking. His
  name was Walter Aynesworth, and he was a writer of short stories&mdash;a
  novelist in embryo.</p>

  <p>"What I envy you most, Lovell," he declared, "is your escape from the
  deadly routine of our day by day life. Here in London it seems to me that we
  live the life of automatons. We lunch, we dine, we amuse or we bore
  ourselves, and we sleep&mdash;and all the rest of the world does the same.
  Passion we have outgrown, emotion we have destroyed by analysis. The storms
  which shake humanity break over other countries. What is there left to us of
  life? Civilization ministers too easily to our needs, existence has become a
  habit. No wonder that we are a tired race."</p>

  <p>"Life is the same, the world over," another man remarked. "With every
  forward step in civilization, life must become more mechanical. London is no
  worse than Paris, or Paris than Tokyo."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth shook his head. "I don't agree with you," he replied. "It is
  the same, more or less, with all European countries, but the Saxon
  temperament, with its mixture of philosophy and philistinism, more than any
  other, gravitates towards the life mechanical. Existence here has become
  fossilized. We wear a mask upon our faces; we carry a gauge for our emotions.
  Lovell is going where the one great force of primitive life remains. He is
  going to see war. He is going to breathe an atmosphere hot with naked
  passion; he is going to rub shoulders with men who walk hand in hand with
  death. That's the sort of tonic we all want, to remind us that we are human
  beings with blood in our veins, and not sawdust-stuffed dolls."</p>

  <p>Then Lovell broke silence. He took his pipe from his mouth, and he
  addressed Aynesworth.</p>

  <p>"Walter," he said, "you are talking rot. There is nothing very complex or
  stimulating about the passion of war, when men kill one another unseen; where
  you feel the sting in your heart which comes from God knows where, and you
  crumple up, with never a chance to have a go at the chap who has potted you
  from the trenches, or behind a rock, a thousand yards off. Mine is going to
  be, except from a spectacular point of view, a very barren sort of year,
  compared with what yours might be if the fire once touched your eyes. I go
  where life is cruder and fiercer, perhaps, but you remain in the very city of
  tragedies."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth laughed, as he lit a fresh cigarette.</p>

  <p>"City of tragedies!" he exclaimed. "It sounds all right, but it's bunkum
  all the same. Show me where they lie, Lovell, old chap. Tell me where to stir
  the waters."</p>

  <p>Several of those who were watching him noticed a sudden change in Lovell's
  face. The good humor and bonhomie called up by this last evening amongst his
  old friends had disappeared. His face had fallen into graver lines, his eyes
  seemed fixed with a curious introspective steadiness on a huge calendar which
  hung from the wall. When at last he turned towards Aynesworth, his tone was
  almost solemn.</p>

  <p>"Some of them don't lie so very far from the surface, Walter," he said.
  "There is one"&mdash;he took out his watch&mdash;"there is one which, if you
  like, I will tell you about. I have just ten minutes."</p>

  <p>"Good!"</p>

  <p>"Go ahead, Lovell, old chap!"</p>

  <p>"Have a drink first!"</p>

  <p>He held out his hand. They were all silent. He stood up amongst them, by
  far the tallest man there, with his back to the chimney piece, and his eyes
  still lingering about that calendar.</p>

  <p>"Thirteen years ago," he said, "two young men&mdash;call them by their
  Christian names, Wingrave and Lumley&mdash;shared a somewhat extensive
  hunting box in Leicestershire. They were both of good family, well off, and
  fairly popular, Lumley the more so perhaps. He represented the ordinary type
  of young Englishman, with a stronger dash than usual of selfishness. Wingrave
  stood for other things. He was reticent and impenetrable. People called him
  mysterious."</p>

  <p>Lovell paused for a moment to refill his pipe. The sudden light upon his
  face, as he struck a match, seemed to bring into vivid prominence something
  there, indescribable in words, yet which affected his hearers equally with
  the low gravity of his speech. The man himself was feeling the tragedy of the
  story he told.</p>

  <p>"They seemed," he continued, "always to get on well together, until they
  fell in love with the same woman. Her name we will say was Ruth. She was the
  wife of the Master of Hounds with whom they hunted. If I had the
  story-writing gifts of Aynesworth here, I would try to describe her. As I
  haven't, I will simply give you a crude idea of what she seemed like to
  me.</p>

  <p>"She was neither dark nor fair, short nor tall; amongst a crowd of other
  women, she seemed undistinguishable by any special gifts; yet when you had
  realized her there was no other woman in the room. She had the eyes of an
  angel, only they were generally veiled; she had the figure of a miniature
  Venus, soft and with delicate curves, which seemed somehow to be always
  subtly asserting themselves, although she affected in her dress an almost
  puritanical simplicity. Her presence in a room was always felt at once. There
  are some women, beautiful or plain, whose sex one scarcely recognizes. She
  was not one of these! She seemed to carry with her the concentrated essence
  of femininity. Her quiet movements, the almost noiseless rustling of her
  clothes, the quaint, undistinguishable perfumes which she used, her soft,
  even voice, were all things which seemed individual to her. She was like a
  study in undernotes, and yet"&mdash;Lovell paused a moment&mdash;"and yet no
  Spanish dancing woman, whose dark eyes and voluptuous figure have won her the
  crown of the demi-monde, ever possessed that innate and mystic gift of
  kindling passion like that woman. I told you I couldn't describe her! I
  can't! I can only speak of effects. If my story interests you, you must build
  up your own idea of her."</p>

  <p>"Becky Sharpe!" Aynesworth murmured.</p>

  <p>Lovell nodded.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he admitted, "only Ruth was a lady. To go on with my story. A
  hunting coterie, as you fellows know, means lots of liberty, and a general
  free-and-easiness amongst the sexes, which naturally leads to flirtations
  more or less serious. Ruth's little affairs were either too cleverly
  arranged, or too harmless for gossip. Amongst the other women of the hunt,
  she seemed outwardly almost demure. But one day&mdash;there was a row!"</p>

  <p>Lovell paused, and took a drink from a glass by his side.</p>

  <p>"I hope you fellows won't think that I'm spinning this out," he said. "It
  is, after all, in itself only a commonplace story, but I've carried it locked
  up in my memory for years, and now that I've let it loose, it unwinds itself
  slowly. This is how the row came about. Lumley one afternoon missed Wingrave
  and Ruth from the hunting field. Someone most unfortunately happened to tell
  him that they had left the run together, and had been seen riding together
  towards White Lodge, which was the name of the house where these two young
  men lived. Lumley followed them. He rode into the stable yard, and found
  there Ruth's mare and Wingrave's covert hack, from which he had not changed
  when they had left the field. Both animals had evidently been ridden hard,
  and there was something ominous in the smile with which the head groom told
  him that Lady Ruth and Wingrave were in the house.</p>

  <p>"The two men had separate dens. Wingrave's was much the better furnished,
  as he was a young man of considerable taste, and he had also fitted it with
  sporting trophies collected from many countries. This room was at the back of
  the house, and Lumley deliberately crossed the lawn and looked in at the
  window."</p>

  <p>Lovell paused for a moment or two to relight his pipe.</p>

  <p>"Remember," he continued, "that I have to put this story together, partly
  from facts which came to my knowledge afterwards, and partly from reasonable
  deductions. I may say at once that I do not know what Lumley saw when he
  played the spy. The housekeeper had just taken tea in, and it is possible
  that Wingrave may have been holding his guest's hand, or that something in
  their faces or attitude convinced him that his jealousy was well founded.
  Anyhow, it is certain that Lumley was half beside himself with rage when he
  strode away from that window. Then in the avenue he must have heard the soft
  patter of hounds coming along the lane, or perhaps seen the pink coats of the
  huntsmen through the hedge. This much is certain. He hurried down the drive,
  and returned with Ruth's husband."</p>

  <p>Lovell took another drink. No one spoke. No one even made a remark. The
  little circle of listeners had caught something of his own gravity. The story
  was an ordinary one enough, but something in Lovell's manner of telling it
  seemed somehow to bring into their consciousness the apprehension of the
  tangled web of passions which burned underneath its sordid details.</p>

  <p>"Ruth's husband&mdash;Sir William I will call him&mdash;stood side by side
  with Lumley before the window. What they saw I cannot tell you. They entered
  the room. The true story of what happened there I doubt if anyone will ever
  know. The evidence of servants spoke of raised voices and the sound of a
  heavy fall. When they were summoned, Sir William lay on the floor
  unconscious. Lady Ruth had fainted; Lumley and Wingrave were both bending
  over the former. On the floor were fragments of paper, which were afterwards
  put together, and found to be the remains of a check for a large amount,
  payable to Lady Ruth, and signed by Wingrave.</p>

  <p>"The sequel is very soon told. Sir William died in a few days, and
  Wingrave, on the evidence of Lumley and Ruth, was committed for manslaughter,
  and sent to prison for fifteen years!"</p>

  <p>Lovell paused. A murmur went round the little group of listeners. The
  story, after all, except for Lovell's manner of telling it, was an ordinary
  one. Everyone felt that there was something else behind.</p>

  <p>So they asked no questions whilst Lovell drank his whisky and soda, and
  refilled his pipe. Again his eyes seemed to wander to the calendar.</p>

  <p>"According to Lady Ruth's evidence," he said thoughtfully, "her husband
  entered the room at the exact moment when she was rejecting Wingrave's
  advances, and indignantly refusing a check which he was endeavoring to
  persuade her to accept. A struggle followed between the two men, with fatal
  results for Sir William. That," he added slowly, "is the story which the
  whole world read, and which most of it believes. Here, however, are a few
  corrections of my own, and a suggestion or two for you, Aynesworth, and those
  of you who like to consider yourselves truth seekers. First, then, Lady Ruth
  was a self-invited guest at White Lodge. She had asked Wingrave to return
  with her, and as they sat together in his room, she confessed that she was
  worried, and asked for his advice. She was in some money trouble, ingeniously
  explained, no doubt. Wingrave, with the utmost delicacy, offered his
  assistance, which was of course accepted. It was exactly what she was there
  for. She was in the act of taking the check, when she saw her husband and
  Lumley. Her reputation was at stake. Her subsequent course of action and
  evidence becomes obvious. The check unexplained was ruin. She explained
  it!</p>

  <p>"Of the struggle, and of the exact means by which Sir William received his
  injuries, I know nothing. There is the evidence! It may or may not be true.
  The most serious part of the case, so far as Lady Ruth was concerned, lay in
  the facts as to her husband's removal from the White Lodge. In an unconscious
  state he was driven almost twelve miles at a walking pace. No stimulants were
  administered, and though they passed two doctors' houses no stop was made. A
  doctor was not sent for until half an hour after they reached home, and even
  then they seemed to have chosen the one who lived furthest away. The
  conclusion is obvious enough to anyone who knows the facts of the case. Sir
  William was not meant to live!</p>

  <p>"Wingrave's trial was a famous one. He had no friends and few
  sympathizers, and he insisted upon defending himself. His cross examination
  of the man who had been his friend created something like a sensation.
  Amongst other things, he elicited the fact that Lumley, after first seeing
  the two together, had gone and fetched Sir William. It was a terrible half
  hour for Lumley, and when he left the box, amongst the averted faces of his
  friends, the sweat was pouring down his face. I can seem him now, as though
  it were yesterday. Then Lady Ruth followed. She was quietly dressed; the
  effect she produced was excellent. She told her story. She hinted at the
  insult. She spoke of the check. She had imagined no harm in accepting
  Wingrave's invitation to tea. Men and women of the hunt, who were on friendly
  terms, treated one another as comrades. She spoke of the blow. She had seen
  it delivered, and so on. And all the time, I sat within a few feet of
  Wingrave, and I knew that in the black box before him were burning love
  letters from this woman, to the man whose code of honor would ever have
  protected her husband from disgrace; and I knew that I was listening to the
  thing which you, Aynesworth, and many of your fellow story writers, have so
  wisely and so ignorantly dilated upon&mdash;the vengeance of a woman denied.
  Only I heard the words themselves, cold, earnest words, fall one by one from
  her lips like a sentence of doom&mdash;and there was life in the thing, life
  and death! When she had finished, the whole court was in a state of tension.
  Everyone was leaning forward. It would be the most piquant, the most
  wonderful cross examination every heard&mdash;the woman lying to save her
  honor and to achieve her vengeance; the man on trial for his life. Wingrave
  stood up. Lady Ruth raised her veil, and looked at him from the witness box.
  There was the most intense silence I ever realized. Who could tell the things
  which flashed from one to the other across the dark well of the court; who
  could measure the fierce, silent scorn which seemed to blaze from his eyes,
  as he held her there&mdash;his slave until he chose to give the signal for
  release? At last he looked away towards the judge, and the woman fell forward
  in the box gasping, a crumpled up, nerveless heap of humanity.</p>

  <p>"'My lord,' he said, 'I have no questions to ask this witness!'</p>

  <p>"Everyone staggered. Wingrave's few friends were horrified. After that
  there was, of course, no hope for him. He got fifteen years' penal
  servitude."</p>

  <p>Like an echo from that pent-up murmur of feeling which had rippled through
  the crowded court many years ago, his little group of auditors almost gasped
  as Lovell left his place and strolled down the room. Aynesworth laid his hand
  upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"All the time," he said, "you were looking at that calendar! Why?"</p>

  <p>Lovell once more faced them. He was standing with his back to a round
  table, strewn with papers and magazines.</p>

  <p>"It was the date," he said, "and the fact that I must leave England within
  a few hours, which forced this story from me. Tomorrow Wingrave will be free!
  Listen, Aynesworth," he continued, turning towards him, "and the rest of you
  who fancy that it is I who am leaving a humdrum city for the world of
  tragedies! I leave you the legacy of a greater one than all Asia will yield
  to me! Lady Ruth is married to Lumley, and they hold today in London a very
  distinguished social position. Tomorrow Wingrave takes a hand in the game. He
  was once my friend; I was in court when he was tried; I was intimately
  acquainted with the lawyer's clerk who had the arrangement of his papers. I
  know what no one else breathing knows. He is a man who never forgives; a man
  who was brutally deceived, and who for years has had no other occupation than
  to brood upon his wrongs. He is very wealthy indeed, still young, he has
  marvelous tenacity of purpose, and he has brains. Tomorrow he will be
  free!"</p>

  <p>Aynesworth drew a little breath.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he murmured, "if anything will happen."</p>

  <p>Lovell shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Where I go," he said, "the cruder passions may rage, and life and death
  be reckoned things of little account. But you who remain&mdash;who can
  tell?&mdash;you may look into the face of mightier things."</p><br>

  <h2>II. &mdash; OUTSIDE THE PALE</h2>

  <p class="first">Three men were together in a large and handsomely furnished
  sitting room of the Clarence Hotel, in Piccadilly. One, pale, quiet, and
  unobtrusive, dressed in sober black, the typical lawyer's clerk, was busy
  gathering up a collection of papers and documents from the table, over which
  they had been strewn. His employer, who had more the appearance of a country
  gentleman than the junior partner in the well-known firm of Rocke and Son,
  solicitors, had risen to his feet, and was drawing on his gloves. At the head
  of the table was the client.</p>

  <p>"I trust, Sir Wingrave, that you are satisfied with this account of our
  stewardship," the solicitor said, as his clerk left the room. "We have felt
  it a great responsibility at times, but everything seems to have turned out
  very well. The investments, of course, are all above suspicion."</p>

  <p>"Perfectly satisfied, I thank you," was the quiet reply. "You seem to have
  studied my interests in a very satisfactory manner."</p>

  <p>Mr. Rocke had other things to say, but his client's manner seemed designed
  to create a barrier of formality between them. He hesitated, unwilling to
  leave, yet finding it exceedingly difficult to say the things which were in
  his mind. He temporized by referring back to matters already discussed,
  solely for the purpose of prolonging the interview.</p>

  <p>"You have quite made up your mind, then, to put the Tredowen property on
  the market," he remarked. "You will excuse my reminding you of the fact that
  you have large accumulated funds in hand, and nearly a hundred thousand
  pounds worth of easily realizable securities. Tredowen has been in your
  mother's family for a good many years, and I should doubt whether it will be
  easily disposed of."</p>

  <p>The man at the head of the table raised his head. He looked steadily at
  the lawyer, who began to wish that he had left the room with his clerk.
  Decidedly, Sir Wingrave Seton was not an easy man to get on with.</p>

  <p>"My mind is quite made up, thank you, on this and all other matters
  concerning which I have given you instructions," was the calm reply. "I have
  had plenty of time for consideration," he added drily.</p>

  <p>The lawyer had his opening at last, and he plunged.</p>

  <p>"Sir Wingrave," he said, "we were at college together, and our connection
  is an old one. You must forgive me if I say how glad I am to see you here,
  and to know that your bad time is over. I can assure you that you have had my
  deepest sympathy. Nothing ever upset me so much as that unfortunate affair. I
  sincerely trust that you will do your best now to make up for lost time. You
  are still young, and you are rich. Let us leave business alone now, for the
  moment. What can I do for you as a friend, if you will allow me to call you
  so?"</p>

  <p>Wingrave turned slightly in his chair. In his altered position, a ray of
  sunshine fell for the first time upon his gaunt but striking face. Lined and
  hardened, as though by exposure and want of personal care, there was also a
  lack of sensibility, an almost animal callousness, on the coldly lit eyes and
  unflinching mouth, which readily suggested some terrible and recent
  experience&mdash;something potent enough to have dried up the human nature
  out of the man and left him soulless. His clothes had the impress of the
  ready-made, although he wore them with a distinction which was obviously
  inherent; and notwithstanding the fact that he seemed to have been writing,
  he wore gloves.</p>

  <p>"I am much obliged to you, Rocke," he said. "Let me repeat your question.
  What is there that you can do for me?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Rocke was apparently a little nonplussed. The absolute
  imperturbability of the man who had once been his friend was
  disconcerting.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "the governor sent me instead of coming himself, because
  he thought that I might be more useful to you. London changes so
  quickly&mdash;you would hardly know your way about now. I should like you to
  come and dine with me tonight, and I'll take you round anywhere you care to
  go; and then if you don't want to go back to your old tradespeople, I could
  take you to my tailor and bookmaker."</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" Wingrave asked calmly.</p>

  <p>Rocke was again taken aback.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," he answered. "There must be many ways in which I could be
  useful to you, but I can't think of them all at once. I am here to serve you
  professionally or as a friend, to the best of my ability. Can you suggest
  anything yourself? What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"That is the question," Wingrave said, "which I have been asking myself.
  Unfortunately, up to now, I have not been able to answer it. Regarding
  myself, however, from the point of view of a third party, I should say that
  the thing I was most in need of was the society of my fellow creatures."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," Rocke declared. "That is what I thought you would say! It won't
  take us long to arrange something of the sort for you."</p>

  <p>"Can you put me up," Wingrave asked, "at your club, and introduce me to
  your friends there?"</p>

  <p>Rocke flinched before the steady gaze of those cold enquiring eyes, in
  which he fancied, too, that a gleam of malice shone. The color mounted to his
  cheeks. It was a most embarrassing situation.</p>

  <p>"I can introduce you to some decent fellows, of course, and to some very
  charming ladies," he said hesitatingly, "but as to the
  club&mdash;I&mdash;well, don't you think yourself that it would scarcely be
  wise to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," Wingrave interrupted. "And these ladies that you spoke
  of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh! There's no difficulty about that," Rocke declared with an air of
  relief. "I can make up a little dinner party for tonight, if you like.
  There's an awfully smart American woman over here, with the Fanciful Fan
  Company&mdash;I'm sure you'd like her, and she'd come like a shot. Then I'd
  get Daisy Vane&mdash;she's all right. They don't know anything, and wouldn't
  care if they did. Besides, you could call yourself what you liked."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Wingrave said. "I am afraid I did not make myself quite
  clear. I was not thinking of play fellows. I was thinking of the men and
  women of my own order. Shall I put the matter quite clearly? Can I take my
  place in society under my own name, renew my old friendships and build up new
  ones? Can I do this even at the risk of a few difficulties at first? I am not
  a sensitive man. I am prepared for the usual number of disagreeable
  incidents. But can I win my way through?"</p>

  <p>With his back against the wall, Rocke displayed more courage. Besides,
  what was the use of mincing matters with a man who had all the appearance of
  a human automaton, who never flinched or changed color, and whose passions
  seemed dried up and withered things?</p>

  <p>"I am afraid not, Sir Wingrave," he said. "I should not recommend you to
  try, at any rate for the present."</p>

  <p>"Give me your reasons," was the cool response.</p>

  <p>"I will do so with pleasure," Rocke answered. "About the time of the trial
  and immediately afterwards, there was a certain amount of sympathy for you.
  People felt that you must have received a good deal of provocation, and there
  were several unexplained incidents which told in your favor. Today, I should
  think that the feeling amongst those who remember the affair at all is rather
  the other way. You heard, I believe, that Lady Ruth married Lumley
  Barrington?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Barrington has been very successful at the Bar, and they say that he is
  certain of a judgeship before long. His wife has backed him up well, they
  have entertained lavishly, and today I should think that she is one of the
  most popular hostesses in London. In her earlier days, I used to hear that
  she was one of the very fast hunting set&mdash;that was the time when you
  knew her. I can assure you that if ever that was true, she is a completely
  altered woman today. She is patroness of half a dozen great charitable
  schemes, she writes very clever articles in the Reviews on the Betterment of
  the Poor Question, and royalty itself visits at her house."</p>

  <p>"I see," Wingrave said drily. "I was not aware of these changes."</p>

  <p>"If ever," Mr. Rocke continued, "people were inclined to look a little
  askance at her, that has all gone by. Today she is one of the last women in
  the world of whom people would be likely to believe ill."</p>

  <p>Wingrave nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"I am very much obliged to you," he said, "for this information. You seem
  to have come here today, Mr. Rocke, with good intentions towards me. Let me
  ask you to put yourself in my place. I am barely forty years old, and I am
  rich. I want to make the most of my life&mdash;under the somewhat peculiar
  circumstances. How and where should you live?"</p>

  <p>"It depends a little upon your tastes, of course," Rocke answered. "You
  are a sportsman, are you not?"</p>

  <p>"I am fond of sport," Wingrave answered. "At least I was. At present I am
  not conscious of having any positive tastes."</p>

  <p>"I think," Rocke continued, "that I should first of all change my name.
  Then, without making any effort to come into touch with your old friends, I
  should seek acquaintance amongst the Bohemian world of London and Paris.
  There I might myself, perhaps, be able to help you. For sport, you might fish
  in Norway or Iceland, or shoot in Hungary; you could run to a yacht if you
  cared about it, and if you fancy big game, why, there's all Africa before
  you."</p>

  <p>Wingrave listened, without changing a muscle of his face.</p>

  <p>"Your programme," he remarked, "presupposes that I have no ambitions
  beyond the pursuit of pleasure."</p>

  <p>Rocke shrugged his shoulders. He was becoming more at his ease. He felt
  that his advice was sound, that he was showing a most comprehensive grasp of
  the situation.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, "that none of what we call the careers are open to
  you. You could not enter Parliament, and you are too old for the professions.
  The services, of course, are impossible. You might write, if your tastes ran
  that way. Nowadays, it seems to be the fashion to record one's experiences in
  print, if&mdash;if they should happen to be in any way exceptional. I can
  think of nothing else!"</p>

  <p>"I am very much obliged to you," Wingrave said. "Your suggestions are
  eminently practical. I will think them over. Don't let me keep you any
  longer!"</p>

  <p>"About this evening," Rocke remarked. "Shall I fix up that little dinner
  party? You have only to say the word!"</p>

  <p>"I am very much obliged to you, but I think not," answered Wingrave. "I
  will dine with you alone some evening, with pleasure! Not just as
  present!"</p>

  <p>Rocke looked, as he felt, puzzled. He honestly wished to be of service to
  this man, but he was at a loss to know what further suggestion he could make.
  There was something impenetrable about his client, something which he could
  not arrive at, behind the hard, grim face and measured words. He could not
  even guess as to what the man's hopes or intentions were. Eventually,
  although with some reluctance, he took up his hat.</p>

  <p>"Well, Sir Wingrave," he said, "if there is really nothing I can do for
  you, I will go. If you should change your mind, you have only to telephone.
  You can command me at any time. I am only anxious to be of service to
  you."</p>

  <p>"You have already been of service to me," Wingrave answered quietly. "You
  have spoken the truth! You have helped me to realize my position more
  exactly. Will you give your father my compliments and thanks, and say that I
  am entirely satisfied with the firm's conduct of affairs during
  my&mdash;absence?"</p>

  <p>Rocke nodded.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he said. "That will please the governor! I must be off now. I
  hope you'll soon be feeling quite yourself again, Sir Wingrave! It must seem
  a bit odd at first, I suppose, but it will wear off all right. What you want,
  after all, is society. Much better let me arrange that little dinner for
  tonight!"</p>

  <p>Wingrave shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Later on, perhaps," he answered. "Good morning!"</p>

  <h2>III. &mdash; A STUDENT OF CHARACTER</h2>

  <p class="first">Left alone, Wingrave walked for several minutes up and down
  the room, his hands behind him, his head bent. He walked, not restlessly, but
  with measured footsteps. His mind was fixed steadfastly upon the one
  immediate problem of his own future. His interview with Rocke had
  unsettled&mdash;to a certain extent unnerved&mdash;him. Was this freedom for
  which he had longed so passionately, this return into civilized life, to mean
  simply the exchange of an iron-barred cell for a palace whose outer gates
  were as hopelessly locked, even though the key was of gold! Freedom! Was it
  after all an illusion? Was his to be the hog's paradise of empty delights;
  were the other worlds indeed forbidden? He moved abruptly to the window and
  threw it open. Below was Piccadilly, brilliant with May sunshine, surging
  with life. Motors and carriages, omnibuses and hansoms, were all jostled
  together in a block; the pavements were thronged with a motley and
  ever-hurrying crowd. It seemed to him, accustomed to the callous and hopeless
  appearance of a less happy tribe, that the faces of these people were all
  aflame with the joy of the springtime. The perfume from the great clusters of
  yellow daffodils and violets floated up from the flower sellers' baskets
  below; the fresh, warm air seemed to bring him poignant memories of
  crocus-starred lawns, of trim beds of hyacinths, of the song of birds, of the
  perfume of drooping lilac. Grim and motionless, as a figure of fate, Wingrave
  looked down from his window, with cold, yet discerning eyes. He was still an
  alien, a denizen in another world from that which flowed so smoothly and
  pleasantly below. It was something to which he did not belong, which he
  doubted, indeed, if ever again he could enter. He had no part in it, no share
  in that vigorous life, whose throbbings he could dimly feel, though his own
  heart was beating to a slower and a very different tune. They were his
  fellows in name only. Between him and them stood the judgment
  of&mdash;Rocke!</p>

  <p>The evil chances of the world are many! It was whilst his thoughts
  traveled in this fashion that the electric landaulette of Lady Ruth
  Barrington glided round the corner from St. James' Street, and joined in the
  throng of vehicles slowly making their way down Piccadilly. His attention was
  attracted first by the white and spotless liveries of the servants&mdash;the
  form of locomotion itself was almost new to him. Then he saw the woman who
  leaned back amongst the cushions. She was elegantly dressed; she wore no
  veil; she did not look a day more than thirty. She was attractive, from the
  tips of her patent shoes, to the white bow which floated on the top of her
  lace parasol; a perfectly dressed, perfectly turned out woman. She had, too,
  the lazy confident air of a woman sure of herself and her friends. She knew
  nothing of the look which flashed down upon her from the window overhead.</p>

  <p>Wingrave turned away with a little gasp; a half-stifled exclamation had
  crept out from between his teeth. His cheeks seemed paler than ever, and his
  eyes unnaturally bright. Nevertheless, he was completely master of himself.
  On the table was a large deed box of papers, which Rocke had left for his
  inspection. From its recesses he drew out a smaller box, unlocked it with a
  key from his chain, and emptied its sole contents&mdash;a small packet of
  letters&mdash;upon the table. He counted them one by one. They were all
  there&mdash;and on top a photograph. A breath of half-forgotten perfume stole
  out into the room. He opened one of the letters, and its few passionate words
  came back to his memory, linked with a hundred other recollections, the
  desire of her eyes, of her lips raised for his, the caressing touch of her
  fingers. He found himself wondering, in an impersonal sort of way, that these
  things should so little affect him. His blood ran no less coldly, nor did his
  pulses beat the faster, for this backward glance into things finished.</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door. He raised his head.</p>

  <p>"Come in!"</p>

  <p>A slim, fair young man obeyed the summons, and advanced into the room.
  Wingrave eyed him with immovable face. Nevertheless, his manner somehow
  suggested a displeased surprise.</p>

  <p>"Sir Wingrave Seton, I believe?" the intruder said cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"That is my name," Wingrave admitted; "but my orders below have evidently
  been disobeyed. I am not disposed to receive visitors today."</p>

  <p>The intruder was not in the least abashed. He laid his hat upon the table,
  and felt in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry," he said. "They did try to keep me out, but I told them
  that my business was urgent. I have been a journalist, you see, and am used
  to these little maneuvers."</p>

  <p>Wingrave looked at him steadily, with close-drawn eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Am I to understand," he said "that you are in here in your journalistic
  capacity?"</p>

  <p>The newcomer shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Pray do not think," he said, "that I should be guilty of such an
  impertinence. My name is Aynesworth. Walter Aynesworth. I have a letter for
  you from Lovell. You remember him, I daresay. Here it is!"</p>

  <p>He produced it from his breast coat pocket, and handed it over.</p>

  <p>"Where is Lovell?" Wingrave asked.</p>

  <p>"He left for the East early this morning," Aynesworth answered. "He had to
  go almost at an hour's notice."</p>

  <p>Wingrave broke the seal, and read the letter through. Afterwards he tore
  it into small pieces and threw them into the grate.</p>

  <p>"What do you want with me, Mr. Aynesworth?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I want to be your secretary," Aynesworth answered.</p>

  <p>"My secretary," Wingrave repeated. "I am much obliged to you, but I am not
  requiring anyone in that capacity."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," Aynesworth answered, "but I think you are. You may not have
  realized it yet, but if you will consider the matter carefully, I think you
  will agree with me that a secretary, or companion of some sort, is exactly
  what you do need."</p>

  <p>"Out of curiosity," Wingrave remarked, "I should be glad to know why you
  think so."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Aynesworth answered. "In the first place, I know the story of
  your life, and the unfortunate incident which has kept you out of society for
  the last ten years."</p>

  <p>"From Lovell, I presume," Wingrave interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Aynesworth admitted. "Ten years' absence from English life
  today means that you return to it an absolute and complete stranger. You
  would be like a Cook's tourist abroad, without a guide or a Baedeker, if you
  attempted to rely upon yourself. Now I am rather a Bohemian sort of person,
  but I have just the sort of all-round knowledge which would be most useful to
  you. I have gone a little way into society, and I know something about
  politics. I can bring you up-to-date on both these matters. I know where to
  dine well in town, and where to be amused. I can tell you where to get your
  clothes, and the best place for all the etceteras. If you want to travel, I
  can speak French and German; and I consider myself a bit of a sportsman."</p>

  <p>"I am sure," Wingrave answered, "I congratulate you upon your versatility.
  I am quite convinced! I shall advertise at once for a secretary!"</p>

  <p>"Why advertise?" Aynesworth asked. "I am here!"</p>

  <p>Wingrave shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You would not suit me at all," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Aynesworth asked. "I forget whether I mentioned all my
  accomplishments. I am an Oxford man with a degree, and I can write tolerable
  English. I've a fair head for figures, and I don't require too large a
  salary."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," Wingrave answered drily. "You are altogether too desirable? I
  should not require an Admirable Crichton for my purpose."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth remained unruffled.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said. "You know best, of course! Suppose you tell me what
  sort of a man would satisfy you!"</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" Wingrave asked coldly.</p>

  <p>"It would amuse me," Aynesworth answered, "and I've come a mile or so out
  of my way, and given up a whole morning to come and see you. Go on! It won't
  take long!"</p>

  <p>Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I will not remind you," he said, "that you came on your own initiative. I
  owe you the idea, however, so I will tell you the sort of person I shall look
  out for. In the first place, I do not require him to be a gentleman."</p>

  <p>"I can be a shocking bounder at times," Aynesworth murmured.</p>

  <p>"He must be more a sort of an upper servant," Wingrave continued. "I
  should require him to obey me implicitly, whatever I told him to do. You have
  a conscience, I presume?"</p>

  <p>"Very little," Aynesworth answered. "I have been a journalist."</p>

  <p>"You have the remnants of one, at all events," Wingrave said, "quite
  sufficient, no doubt, to interfere with your possible usefulness to me. I
  must have someone who is poor&mdash;too poor to question my will, or to
  dispute my orders, whatever they might be."</p>

  <p>"I have never," Aynesworth declared, "possessed a superfluous half-crown
  in my life."</p>

  <p>"You probably possess what is called a sense of honor," Wingrave
  continued. "You would certainly disapprove of some of my proceedings, and you
  would probably disobey my orders."</p>

  <p>"Sense of honor!" Aynesworth repeated. "You have too flattering an opinion
  of me. I don't know what it is. I always cheat at cards if I get the
  chance."</p>

  <p>Wingrave turned away.</p>

  <p>"You are a fool," he said, "and you won't suit me."</p>

  <p>"When can I come?" Aynesworth asked.</p>

  <p>"You can stay now," Wingrave answered. "Your salary will be four hundred a
  year. You will live at my expense. The day you disobey an order of mine, you
  go! No notice, mind!"</p>

  <p>"Agreed," Aynesworth answered. "What should I do first? Send you a tailor,
  I should think."</p>

  <p>Wingrave nodded.</p>

  <p>"I will give the afternoon to that sort of people," he said. "Here is a
  list of the tradesmen I used to deal with. Kindly avoid them."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth glanced at the slip of paper, and nodded.</p>

  <p>"All out-of-date now," he remarked. "I'll be back to lunch."</p>
  <hr>

  <p><a name="ch1-04"
     id="ch1-04"><!--Chapter Anchor--></a></p>

  <h2>IV. &mdash; A DELICATE MISSION</h2>

  <p class="first">Aynesworth was back in less than an hour. He carried under
  his arm a brown paper parcel, the strings of which he commenced at once to
  untie. Wingrave, who had been engrossed in the contents of his deed box,
  watched him with immovable face.</p>

  <p>"The tailor will be here at two-thirty," he announced, "and the other
  fellows will follow on at half an hour's interval. The manicurist and the
  barber are coming at six o'clock."</p>

  <p>Wingrave nodded.</p>

  <p>"What have you there?" he asked, pointing to the parcel.</p>

  <p>"Cigars and cigarettes, and jolly good ones, too," Aynesworth answered,
  opening a flat tin box, and smelling the contents appreciatively. "Try one of
  these! The finest Turkish tobacco grown!"</p>

  <p>"I don't smoke," Wingrave answered.</p>

  <p>"Oh! You've got out of it, but you must pick it up again," Aynesworth
  declared. "Best thing out for the nerves&mdash;sort of humanizes one, you
  know!"</p>

  <p>"Humanizes one, does it?" Wingrave remarked softly. "Well, I'll try!"</p>

  <p>He took a cigarette from the box, curtly inviting Aynesworth to do the
  same.</p>

  <p>"What about lunch?" the latter asked. "Would you care to come round with
  me to the Cannibal Club? Rather a Bohemian set, but there are always some
  good fellows there."</p>

  <p>"I am much obliged," Wingrave answered. "If you will ask me again in a few
  days' time, I shall be very pleased. I do not wish to leave the hotel just at
  present."</p>

  <p>"Do you want me?" Aynesworth asked.</p>

  <p>"Not until five o'clock," Wingrave answered. "I should be glad if you
  would leave me now, and return at that hour. In the meantime, I have a
  commission for you."</p>

  <p>"Good!" Aynesworth declared. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"You will go," Wingrave directed, "to No. 13, Cadogan Street, and you will
  enquire for Lady Ruth Barrington. If she should be out, ascertain the time of
  her return, and wait for her."</p>

  <p>"If she is out of town?"</p>

  <p>"She is in London," Wingrave answered. "I have seen her from the window
  this morning. You will give her a message. Say that you come from me, and
  that I desire to see her tomorrow. The time and place she can fix, but I
  should prefer not to go to her house."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth stooped down to relight his cigarette. He felt that Wingrave
  was watching him, and he wished to keep his face hidden.</p>

  <p>"I am unknown to Lady Ruth," he remarked. "Supposing she should refuse to
  see me?"</p>

  <p>Wingrave looked at him coldly.</p>

  <p>"I have told you what I wish done," he said. "The task does not seem to be
  a difficult one. Please see to it that I have an answer by five
  o'clock&mdash;&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>Aynesworth lunched with a few of his particular friends at the club. They
  heard of his new adventure with somewhat doubtful approbation.</p>

  <p>"You'll never stand the routine, old chap!"</p>

  <p>"And what about your own work!"</p>

  <p>"What will the Daily Scribbler people say?"</p>

  <p>Aynesworth shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I don't imagine it will last very long," he answered, "and I shall get a
  fair amount of time to myself. The work I do on the Daily Scribbler doesn't
  amount to anything. It was a chance I simply couldn't refuse."</p>

  <p>The editor of a well-known London paper leaned back in his chair, and
  pinched a cigar carefully.</p>

  <p>"You'll probably find the whole thing a sell," he remarked. "The story, as
  Lovell told it, sounded dramatic enough, and if the man were to come back to
  life again, fresh and vigorous, things might happen, provided, of course,
  that Lovell was right in his suppositions. But ten or twelve years' solitary
  confinement, although it mayn't sound much on paper, is enough to crush all
  the life and energy out of a man."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You haven't seen him," he said. "I have!"</p>

  <p>"What's he like, Walter?" another man asked.</p>

  <p>"I can't describe him," Aynesworth answered. "I shouldn't like to try.
  I'll bring him here some day. You fellows shall see him for yourselves. I
  find him interesting enough."</p>

  <p>"The whole thing," the editor declared, "will fizzle out. You see if it
  doesn't? A man who's just spent ten or twelve years in prison isn't likely to
  run any risk of going there again. There will be no tragedy; more likely
  reconciliation."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," Aynesworth said imperturbably. "But it wasn't only the
  possibility of anything of that sort happening, you know, which attracted me.
  It was the tragedy of the man himself, with his numbed, helpless life, set
  down here in the midst of us, with a great, blank chasm between him and his
  past. What is there left to drive the wheels? The events of one day are
  simple and monotonous enough to us, because they lean up against the events
  of yesterday, and the yesterdays before! How do they seem, I wonder, to a man
  whose yesterday was more than a decade of years ago!"</p>

  <p>The editor nodded.</p>

  <p>"It must be a grim sensation," he admitted, "but I am afraid with you, my
  dear Walter, it is an affair of shop. You wish to cull from your interesting
  employer the material for that every-becoming novel of yours. Let's go
  upstairs! I've time for one pool."</p>

  <p>"I haven't," Aynesworth answered. "I've a commission to do."</p>

  <p>He left the club and walked westwards, humming softly to himself, but
  thinking all the time intently. His errand disturbed him. He was to be the
  means of bringing together again these two people who had played the
  principal parts in Lovell's drama&mdash;his new employer and the woman who
  had ruined his life. What was the object of it? What manner of vengeance did
  he mean to deal out to her? Lovell's words of premonition returned to him
  just then with curious insistence&mdash;he was so certain that Wingrave's
  reappearance would lead to tragical happenings. Aynesworth himself never
  doubted it. His brief interview with the man into whose service he had almost
  forced himself had impressed him wonderfully. Yet, what weapon was there,
  save the crude one of physical force, with which Wingrave could strike?</p>

  <p>He rang the bell at No. 13, Cadogan Street, and sent in his card by the
  footman. The man accepted it doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Her ladyship has only just got up from luncheon, sir, and she is not
  receiving this afternoon," he announced.</p>

  <p>Aynesworth took back his card, and scribbled upon it the name of the
  newspaper for which he still occasionally worked.</p>

  <p>"Her ladyship will perhaps see me," he said, handing the card back to the
  man. "It is a matter of business. I will not detain her for more than a few
  minutes."</p>

  <p>The man returned presently, and ushered him into a small sitting room.</p>

  <p>"Her ladyship will be quite half an hour before she can see you, sir," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"I will wait," Aynesworth answered, taking up a paper.</p>

  <p>The time passed slowly. At last, the door was opened. A woman, in a plain
  but exquisitely fitting black gown, entered. From Lovell's description,
  Aynesworth recognized her at once, and yet, for a moment, he hesitated to
  believe that this was the woman whom he had come to see. The years had indeed
  left her untouched. Her figure was slight, almost girlish; her complexion as
  smooth, and her coloring, faint though it was, as delicate and natural as a
  child's. Her eyes were unusually large, and the lashes which shielded them
  heavy. It was when she looked at him that Aynesworth began to understand.</p>

  <p>She carried his card in her hand, and glanced at it as he bowed.</p>

  <p>"You are the Daily Scribbler," she said. "You want me to tell you about my
  bazaar, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"I am attached to the Daily Scribbler, Lady Ruth Barrington," Aynesworth
  answered; "but my business this afternoon has nothing to do with the paper. I
  have called with a message from&mdash;an old friend of yours."</p>

  <p>She raised her eyebrows ever so slightly. The graciousness of her manner
  was perceptibly abated.</p>

  <p>"Indeed! I scarcely understand you, Mr.&mdash;Aynesworth."</p>

  <p>"My message," Aynesworth said, "is from Sir Wingrave Seton."</p>

  <p>The look of enquiry, half impatient, half interrogative, faded slowly from
  her face. She stood quite still; her impassive features seemed like a plaster
  cast, from which all life and feeling were drawn out. Her eyes began slowly
  to dilate, and she shivered as though with cold. Then the man who was
  watching her and wondering, knew that this was fear&mdash;fear undiluted and
  naked.</p>

  <p>He stepped forward, and placed a chair for her. She felt for the back of
  it with trembling fingers and sat down.</p>

  <p>"Is&mdash;Sir Wingrave Seton&mdash;out of prison?" she asked in a strange,
  dry tone. One would have thought that she had been choking.</p>

  <p>"Since yesterday," Aynesworth answered.</p>

  <p>"But his time&mdash;is not up yet?"</p>

  <p>"There is always a reduction," Aynesworth reminded her, "for what is
  called good conduct."</p>

  <p>She was silent for several moments. Then she raised her head. She was a
  brave woman, and she was rapidly recovering her self-possession.</p>

  <p>"Well," she asked, "what does he want?"</p>

  <p>"To see you," Aynesworth answered, "tomorrow afternoon, either here or at
  his apartments in the Clarence Hotel. He would prefer not to come here!"</p>

  <p>"Are you his friend?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I am his secretary," Aynesworth answered.</p>

  <p>"You are in his confidence?"</p>

  <p>"I only entered his service this morning," he said.</p>

  <p>"How much do you know," she persisted, "of the unfortunate affair which
  led&mdash;to his imprisonment?"</p>

  <p>"I have been told the whole story," Aynesworth answered.</p>

  <p>Her eyes rested thoughtfully upon his. It seemed as though she were trying
  to read in his face exactly what he meant by "the whole story."</p>

  <p>"Then," she said, "do you think that anything but pain and unpleasantness
  can come of a meeting between us?"</p>

  <p>"Lady Ruth," Aynesworth answered, "it is not for me to form an opinion. I
  am Sir Wingrave Seton's secretary."</p>

  <p>"What is he going to do?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I have no idea," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Is he going abroad?"</p>

  <p>"I know nothing of his plans," Aynesworth declared. "What answer shall I
  take back to him?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him earnestly. Gradually her face was softening. The frozen
  look was passing away. The expression was coming back to her eyes. She leaned
  a little towards him. Her voice, although it was raised above a whisper, was
  full of feeling.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Aynesworth," she murmured, "I am afraid of Sir Wingrave Seton!"</p>

  <p>Aynesworth said nothing.</p>

  <p>"I was always a little afraid of him," she continued, "even in the days
  when we were friendly. He was so hard and unforgiving. I know he thinks that
  he has a grievance against me. He will have been brooding about it all these
  years. I dare not see him! I&mdash;I am terrified!"</p>

  <p>"If that is your answer," Aynesworth said, "I will convey it to him!"</p>

  <p>Her beautiful eyes were full of reproach.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Aynesworth," she said, in a low tone, "for a young man you are very
  unsympathetic."</p>

  <p>"My position," Aynesworth answered, "does not allow me the luxury of
  considering my personal feelings."</p>

  <p>She looked hurt.</p>

  <p>"I forgot," she said, looking for a moment upon the floor; "you have
  probably been prejudiced against me. You have heard only one story.
  Listen"&mdash;she raised her eyes suddenly, and leaned a little forward in
  her chair&mdash;"some day, if you will come and see me when I am alone and we
  have time to spare, I will tell you the whole truth. I will tell you exactly
  what happened! You shall judge for yourself!"</p>

  <p>Aynesworth bowed.</p>

  <p>"In the meantime?"</p>

  <p>Her eyes filled slowly with tears. Aynesworth looked away. He was
  miserably uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"You cannot be quite so hard-hearted as you try to seem, Mr. Aynesworth,"
  she said quietly. "I want to ask you a question. You must answer it? You
  don't know how much it means to me. You are Sir Wingrave Seton's secretary;
  you have access to all his papers. Have you seen any letters of mine? Do you
  know if he still has any in his possession?"</p>

  <p>"My answer to both questions is 'No!'" Aynesworth said a little stiffly.
  "I only entered the service of Sir Wingrave Seton this morning, and I know
  nothing at all, as yet, of his private affairs. And, Lady Ruth, you must
  forgive my reminding you that, in any case, I could not discuss such matters
  with you," he added.</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a faint, strange smile. Afterwards, when he tried
  to do so, Aynesworth found it impossible to describe the expression which
  flitted across her face. He only knew that it left him with the impression of
  having received a challenge.</p>

  <p>"Incorruptible!" she murmured. "Sir Wingrave Seton is indeed a fortunate
  man."</p>

  <p>There was a lingering sweetness in her tone which still had a note of
  mockery in it. Her silence left Aynesworth conscious of a vague sense of
  uneasiness. He felt that her eyes were raised to his, and for some reason,
  which he could not translate even into a definite thought, he wished to avoid
  them. The silence was prolonged. For long afterwards he remembered those few
  minutes. There was a sort of volcanic intensity in the atmosphere. He was
  acutely conscious of small extraneous things, of the perfume of a great bowl
  of hyacinths, the ticking of a tiny French clock, the restless drumming of
  her finger tips upon the arm of her chair. All the time he seemed actually to
  feel her eyes, commanding, impelling, beseeching him to turn round. He did so
  at last, and looked her full in the face.</p>

  <p>"Lady Ruth," he said, "will you favor me with an answer to my
  message?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," she answered, smiling quite naturally. "I will come and see
  Sir Wingrave Seton at four o'clock tomorrow afternoon. You can tell him that
  I think it rather an extraordinary request, but under the circumstances I
  will do as he suggests. He is staying at the Clarence, I presume, under his
  own name? I shall have no difficulty in finding him?"</p>

  <p>"He is staying there under his own name," Aynesworth answered, "and I will
  see that you have no difficulty."</p>

  <p>"So kind of you," she murmured, holding out her hand. And again there was
  something mysterious in her eyes as she raised them to him, as though there
  existed between them already some understanding which mocked the
  conventionality of her words. Aynesworth left the house, and lit a cigarette
  upon the pavement outside with a little sigh of relief. He felt somehow
  humiliated. Did she fancy, he wondered, that he was a callow boy to dance to
  any tune of her piping&mdash;that he had never before seen a beautiful woman
  who wanted her own way?</p>

  <h2>V. &mdash; THE GOSPEL OF HATE</h2>

  <p class="first">"And what," Wingrave asked his secretary as they sat at
  dinner that night, "did you think of Lady Ruth?"</p>

  <p>"In plain words, I should not like to tell you," Aynesworth answered. "I
  only hope that you will not send me to see her again."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Lady Ruth," Aynesworth answered deliberately, "is a very beautiful woman,
  with all the most dangerous gifts of Eve when she wanted her own way. She did
  me the scanty honor of appraising me as an easy victim, and she asked
  questions."</p>

  <p>"For instance?"</p>

  <p>"She wanted me to tell her if you still had in your possession certain
  letters of hers," Aynesworth said.</p>

  <p>"Good! What did you say?"</p>

  <p>"I told her, of course," Aynesworth continued, "that having been in your
  service for a few hours only, I was scarcely in a position to know. I
  ventured further to remind her that such questions, addressed from her to me,
  were, to say the least of it, improper."</p>

  <p>Wingrave's lips parted in what should have been a smile, but the spirit of
  mirth was lacking.</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>"There was nothing else," Aynesworth answered. "She simply dismissed
  me."</p>

  <p>"I can see," Wingrave remarked, "your grievance. You are annoyed because
  she regarded you as too easy a victim."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," Aynesworth admitted.</p>

  <p>"There was some excuse for her, after all," Wingrave continued coolly.
  "She possesses powers which you yourself have already admitted, and you, I
  should say, are a fairly impressionable person, so far as her sex is
  concerned. Confess now, that she did not leave you altogether
  indifferent."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," Aynesworth admitted reluctantly. He did not care to say
  more.</p>

  <p>"In case you should feel any curiosity on the subject," Wingrave remarked,
  "I may tell you that I have those letters which she was so anxious to know
  about, and I shall keep them safe&mdash;even from you! You can amuse yourself
  with her if you like. You will never be able to tell her more than I care for
  her to know."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth continued his dinner in silence. After all, he was beginning to
  fear that he had made a mistake. Lovell had somehow contrived to impart a
  subtly tragic note to his story, but the outcome of it all seemed to assume a
  more sordid aspect. These two would meet, there would be recriminations, a
  tragic appeal for forgiveness, possibly some melodramatic attempt at
  vengeance. The glamour of the affair seemed to him to be fading away, now
  that he had come into actual contact with it. It was not until he began to
  study his companion during a somewhat prolonged silence that he felt the
  reaction. It was then that he began to see new things, that he felt the
  enthusiasm kindled by Lovell's strangely told story begin to revive. It was
  not the watching for events more or less commonplace which would repay him
  for the step he had taken; it was the study of this man, placed in so strange
  a position,&mdash;a man come back to life, after years of absolute isolation.
  He had broken away from the chain which links together men of similar tastes
  and occupations, and which goes to the creation of type. He was in a unique
  position! He was in the world, but not of it. He was groping about amongst
  familiar scenes, over which time had thrown the pall of unfamiliarity. What
  manner of place would he find&mdash;what manner of place did he desire to
  find? It was here that the real interest of the situation culminated. At
  least, so Aynesworth thought then.</p>

  <p>They were dining at a restaurant in the Strand, which Aynesworth had
  selected as representing one, the more wealthy, type of Bohemian life. The
  dinner and wine had been of his choosing. Wingrave had stipulated only for
  the best. Wingrave himself had eaten very little, the bottle of wine stood
  half empty between them. The atmosphere of the place, the effect of the wine,
  the delicate food, and the music, were visible to a greater or less degree,
  according to temperament, amongst all the other little groups of men and
  women by whom they were surrounded. Wingrave alone remained unaffected. He
  was carefully and correctly dressed in clothes borrowed from his new tailor,
  and he showed not the slightest signs of strangeness or gaucherie amongst his
  unfamiliar surroundings. He looked about him always, with the cold, easy
  nonchalance of the man of the world. Of being recognized he had not the
  slightest fear. His frame and bearing, and the brightness of his deep, strong
  eyes, still belonged to early middle age, but his face itself, worn and
  hardened, was the face of an elderly man. The more Aynesworth watched him,
  the more puzzled he felt.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he remarked, "that you are disappointed in this place."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," Wingrave answered. "It is typical of a class, I suppose. It
  is the sort of place I wished to visit."</p>

  <p>In a corner of the room Aynesworth had recognized a friend and fellow
  clubman, who was acting at a neighboring theater. He was dining with some
  young ladies of his company, and beckoned to Aynesworth to come over and join
  them. He pointed them out to Wingrave.</p>

  <p>"Would you care to be introduced?" he asked. "Holiwell is a very good
  fellow, and the girls might interest you. Two of them are Americans, and they
  are very popular."</p>

  <p>Wingrave shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, no!" he said. "I should be glad to meet your friend some time
  when he is alone."</p>

  <p>It was the first intimation which Aynesworth had received of his
  companion's sentiments as regards the other sex. Years afterwards, when his
  attitude towards them was often quoted as being one of the extraordinary
  features of an extraordinary personality, he remembered his perseverance on
  this occasion.</p>

  <p>"You have not spoken to a woman for so many years," he persisted. "Why not
  renew the experience? Nothing so humanizing, you know&mdash;not even
  cigarettes."</p>

  <p>Wingrave's face fell, if possible into sterner lines. His tone was cold
  and hard.</p>

  <p>"My scheme of life," he said, "may be reconstructed more than once before
  I am satisfied. But I can assure you of this! There will be no serious place
  in it for women!"</p>

  <p>Aynesworth shrugged his shoulders. He never doubted but that in a month of
  two his vis-a-vis would talk differently.</p>

  <p>"Your scheme of life," he repeated thoughtfully. "That sounds interesting!
  Have you any objection, I wonder, to telling me what manner of life you
  propose to lead?"</p>

  <p>It was several moments before Wingrave answered him. He was smoking a
  cigar in a mechanical sort of way, but he obviously derived no pleasure from
  it. Yet Aynesworth noticed that some instinct had led him to choose the
  finest brand.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he said, letting his eyes rest coldly upon his questioner, "if
  I told you all that was in my mind you would waive your month's salary and
  get back to your journalism!"</p>

  <p>Aynesworth shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Why should you suppose that?" he asked. "I am not a moralist myself, nor
  am I the keeper of your conscience. I don't think that you could frighten me
  off just yet."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," Wingrave admitted, "there are times when I fear that we
  shall not get on together. I begin to suspect that you have a
  conscience."</p>

  <p>"You are the first," Aynesworth assured him, "who has ever flattered me to
  that extent."</p>

  <p>"It may be elastic, of course," Wingrave continued, "but I suspect its
  existence. I warn you that association with me will try it hard."</p>

  <p>"I accept the challenge," Aynesworth answered lightly.</p>

  <p>"You are rasher than you imagine," Wingrave declared. "For instance, I
  have admitted to you, have I not, that I am interested in my fellow
  creatures, that I want to mix with them and watch them at their daily lives.
  Let me assure you that that interest is not a benevolent one."</p>

  <p>"I never fancied that you were a budding philanthropist," Aynesworth
  remarked, lighting a fresh cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I find myself," Wingrave continued thoughtfully, "in a somewhat unique
  position. I am one of the ordinary human beings with whom the world is
  peopled, but I am not conscious of any of the usual weaknesses of sentiment
  or morality. For instance, if that gentleman with the red face, who has
  obviously eaten and drunk too much, were to have an apoplectic fit at the
  moment, and die in his chair, it would not shock or distress me in the least.
  On the contrary, I should be disposed to welcome his removal from a world
  which he obviously does nothing to adorn."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth glanced at the person in question. He was a theatrical agent
  and financier of stock companies, whom he knew very well by sight.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," Wingrave continued, "that I was born with the usual moral
  sentiments, and the usual feelings of kinship towards my fellow creatures.
  Circumstances, however, have wholly destroyed them. To me, men have become
  the puppets and women the dancing dolls of life. My interest in them, if it
  exists at all, is malevolent. I should like to see them all suffer exactly as
  I have suffered. It would interest me exceedingly."</p>

  <p>Still Aynesworth remained silent. He was anxious to hear all that was in
  the other's mind, and he feared lest any interruption might divert him.</p>

  <p>"There are men in the world," Wingrave continued, "called philanthropists,
  amiable, obese creatures as a rule, whose professed aim in life it is to do
  as much good as possible. I take my stand upon the other pole. It is my
  desire to encourage and to work as much evil as possible. I wish to bring all
  the suffering I can upon those who come within the sphere of my
  influence."</p>

  <p>"You are likely," Aynesworth remarked, "to achieve popularity."</p>

  <p>Wingrave regarded him steadfastly.</p>

  <p>"Your speech," he said, "is flippant, but you yourself do not realize how
  near it comes to the truth. Human beings are like dogs&mdash;they are always
  ready to lick the hand that flogs them. I mean to use the scourge whenever I
  can seize the opportunity, but you will find the jackals at my heels,
  nevertheless, whenever I choose to whistle."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth helped himself to a liqueur. He felt that he needed it.</p>

  <p>"One weakness alone distresses me," Wingrave continued. "In all ordinary
  matters of sentiment I am simply a negation. There is one antipathy, however,
  which I find it hard to overcome. The very sight of a woman, or the sound of
  her voice, distresses me. This is the more unfortunate," he continued,
  "because it is upon the shoulders of her sex that the greater portion of my
  debt to my fellow creatures rests. However, time may help me!"</p>

  <p>Aynesworth leaned back in his chair, and contemplated his companion for
  the next few moments in thoughtful silence. It was hard, he felt, to take a
  man who talked like this seriously. His manner was convincing, his speech
  deliberate and assured. There was not the slightest doubt but that he meant
  what he said, yet it seemed to Aynesworth equally certain that the time would
  come, and come quickly, when the unnatural hardness of the man would yield to
  the genial influence of friendship, of pleasure, of the subtle joys of
  freedom. Those past days of hideous monotony, of profitless, debasing toil,
  the long, sleepless nights, the very nightmare of life to a man of Wingrave's
  culture and habits, might well have poisoned his soul, have filled him with
  ideas such as these. But everything was different now! The history of the
  world could show no epoch when pleasures so many and various were there for
  the man who carries the golden key. Today he was a looker-on, and the ice of
  his years of bitterness had not melted. Tomorrow, at any moment, he might
  catch a whiff of the fragrance of life, and the blood in his veins would move
  to a different tune. This was how it seemed to Aynesworth, as he studied his
  companion through the faint blue mist of tobacco smoke.</p>

  <p>"This expression of your sentiments," he remarked at last, "is interesting
  so far as it goes. I am, however, a practical person, and my connection with
  you is of a practical order. You don't propose, I presume, to promenade the
  streets with a cat-o-nine-tails?"</p>

  <p>"Your curiosity," Wingrave remarked, "is reasonable. Tomorrow I may
  gratify some portion of it after my interview with Lady Ruth. In the
  meantime, I might remark that to the observant person who has wits and money,
  the opportunities for doing evil present themselves, I think, with reasonable
  frequency. I do not propose, however, to leave things altogether to
  chance."</p>

  <p>"A definite scheme of ill-doing," Aynesworth ventured to suggest, "would
  be more satisfactory?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," he admitted.</p>

  <p>He called for the bill, and his eyes wandered once more around the room as
  the waiter counted out the change. The band were playing the "Valse
  Amoureuse"; the air was grown heavy with the odor of tobacco and the mingled
  perfumes of flowers and scents. A refrain of soft laughter followed the
  music. An after-dinner air pervaded the place. Wingrave's lip curled.</p>

  <p>"My lack of kinship with my fellows," he remarked, "is exceedingly well
  defined just now. I agree with the one philosopher who declared that 'eating
  and drinking are functions which are better performed in private.'"</p>

  <p>The two men went on to a theater. The play was a society trifle&mdash;a
  thing of the moment. Wingrave listened gravely, without a smile or any
  particular sign of interest. At the end of the second act, he turned towards
  his companion.</p>

  <p>"The lady in the box opposite," he remarked, "desires to attract your
  attention."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth looked up and recognized Lady Ruth. She was fanning herself
  languidly, but her eyes were fixed upon the two men. She leaned a little
  forward, and her gesture was unmistakable.</p>

  <p>Aynesworth rose to his feet a little doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"You had better go," Wingrave said. "Present my compliments and excuses. I
  feel that a meeting now would amount to an anti-climax."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth made his way upstairs. Lady Ruth was alone, and he noticed that
  she had withdrawn to a chair where she was invisible to the house. Even
  Aynesworth himself could not see her face clearly at first, for she had
  chosen the darkest corner of the box. He gathered an impression of a gleaming
  white neck and bosom rising and falling rather more quickly than was natural,
  eyes which shone softly through the gloom, and the perfume of white roses, a
  great cluster of which lay upon the box ledge. Her voice was scarcely raised
  above a whisper.</p>

  <p>"That is&mdash;Sir Wingrave with you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Aynesworth answered. "It was he who saw you first!"</p>

  <p>She seemed to catch her breath. Her voice was still tremulous.</p>

  <p>"He is changed," she said. "I should not have recognized him."</p>

  <p>"They were the best ten years of his life," Aynesworth answered. "Think of
  how and in what surroundings he has been compelled to live. No wonder that he
  has had the humanity hammered out of him."</p>

  <p>She shivered a little.</p>

  <p>"Is he always like this?" she asked. "I have watched him. He never smiles.
  He looks as hard as fate itself."</p>

  <p>"I have known him only a few hours," Aynesworth reminded her.</p>

  <p>"I dare not come tomorrow," she whispered; "I am afraid of him."</p>

  <p>"Do you wish me to tell him so?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she answered. "You are very unfeeling, Mr.
  Aynesworth."</p>

  <p>"I hope not," he answered, and looked away towards the orchestra. He did
  not wish to meet her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You are!" she murmured. "I have no one to whom I dare speak&mdash;of
  this. I dare not mention his name to my husband. It was my evidence which
  convicted him, and I can see, I know, that he is vindictive. And he has those
  letters! Oh! If I could only get them back?"</p>

  <p>Her voice trembled with an appeal whispered but passionate. It was
  wonderful how musical and yet how softly spoken her words were. They were
  like live things, and the few feet of darkened space through which they had
  passed seemed charged with magnetic influence.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Aynesworth!"</p>

  <p>He turned and faced her.</p>

  <p>"Can't you help me?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot, Lady Ruth."</p>

  <p>The electric bell rang softly from outside, and the orchestra commenced to
  play. Lady Ruth rose and looked at herself in the mirror. Then she turned and
  smiled at her visitor. The pallor of her face was no longer unnatural. She
  was a wonderful woman.</p>

  <p>"I shall come tomorrow," she said. "Shall I see you?"</p>

  <p>"That," he answered, "depends upon Sir Wingrave."</p>

  <p>She made a little grimace as she dismissed him. Wingrave did not speak to
  his companion for some time after he had resumed his seat. Then he inclined
  his head towards him.</p>

  <p>"Have you come to terms with her ladyship?" he asked drily.</p>

  <p>"Not yet!" Aynesworth answered.</p>

  <p>"You can name your own price," he continued. "She will pay! Don't be
  afraid of making her bid up. She has a good deal at stake!"</p>

  <p>Aynesworth made no reply. He was thinking how easy it would be to hate
  this man!</p>

  <h2>VI. &mdash; "HAST THOU FOUND ME, O MINE ENEMY?"</h2>

  <p class="first">Aynesworth was waiting in the hall on the following
  afternoon when Lady Ruth arrived. He had half expected that she would drive
  up to the side door in a hansom, would wear a thick veil, and adopt the other
  appurtenances of a clandestine meeting. But Lady Ruth was much too clever a
  woman for anything of the sort. She descended at the great front entrance
  from her own electric coupe, and swept into the hotel followed by her maid.
  She stopped to speak to the manager of the hotel, who knew her from her
  visits to the world-famous restaurant, and she asked at once for Sir Wingrave
  Seton. Then she saw Aynesworth, and crossed the hall with outstretched
  hand.</p>

  <p>"How nice of you to be here," she murmured. "Can you take me to Sir
  Wingrave at once? I have such a busy afternoon that I was afraid at the last
  moment that I should be unable to come!"</p>

  <p>Aynesworth led her towards the lift.</p>

  <p>"Sir Wingrave is in his sitting room," he remarked. "It is only on the
  first floor."</p>

  <p>She directed her maid where to wait, and followed him. On the way down the
  corridor, he stole a glance at her. She was a little pale, and he could see
  that she had nerved herself to this interview with a great effort. As he
  knocked at the door, her great eyes were raised for a moment to his, and they
  were like the eyes of a frightened child.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>There was no time for more. They were in the room, and Wingrave had risen
  to meet them. Lady Ruth did not hesitate for a moment. She crossed the room
  towards him with outstretched hands. Aynesworth, who was standing a little on
  one side, watched their meeting with intense, though covert interest. She had
  pushed back her veil, her head was a little upraised in a mute gesture of
  appeal.</p>

  <p>She was pale to the lips, but her eyes were soft with hidden tears.
  Wingrave stood stonily silent, like a figure of fate. His hands remained by
  his sides. Her welcome found no response from him. She came to a standstill,
  and, swaying a little, stretched out her hand and steadied herself by
  grasping the back of a chair.</p>

  <p>"Wingrave," she murmured, and her voice was full of musical reproach.</p>

  <p>Aynesworth turned to leave the room, but Wingrave, looking over her head,
  addressed him.</p>

  <p>"You will remain here, Aynesworth," he said. "There are some papers at
  that desk which require sorting."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth hesitated. He had caught the look on Lady Ruth's face.</p>

  <p>"If you could excuse me for half an hour, Sir Wingrave," he began.</p>

  <p>"I cannot spare you at present," Wingrave interrupted. "Kindly
  remain!"</p>

  <p>Aynesworth had no alternative but to obey. Wingrave handed a chair to Lady
  Ruth. He was looking at her steadfastly. There were no signs of any sort of
  emotion in his face. Whatever their relations in the past might have been, it
  was hard to believe, from his present demeanor, that he felt any.</p>

  <p>"Wingrave," she said softly, "are you going to be unkind to me&mdash;you,
  whom I have always thought of in my dreams as the most generous of men! I
  have looked forward so much to seeing you again&mdash;to knowing that you
  were free! Don't disappoint me!"</p>

  <p>Wingrave laughed shortly, and Aynesworth bent closer over his work, with a
  gathering frown upon his forehead. A mirthless laugh is never a pleasant
  sound.</p>

  <p>"Disappoint you!" he repeated calmly. "No! I must try and avoid that! You
  have been looking forward with so much joy to this meeting then? I am
  flattered."</p>

  <p>She shivered a little.</p>

  <p>"I have looked forward to it," she answered, and her voice was dull and
  lifeless with pain. "But you are not glad to see me," she continued. "There
  is no welcome in your face! You are changed&mdash;altogether! Why did you
  send for me?"</p>

  <p>"Listen!"</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. Wingrave was standing upon the hearthrug,
  cold, passionless, Sphinx-like. Lady Ruth was seated a few feet away, but her
  face was hidden.</p>

  <p>"You owe me something!" he said.</p>

  <p>"Owe&mdash;you something?" she repeated vaguely.</p>

  <p>"Do you deny it?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, no!" she declared with emotion. "Not for a moment."</p>

  <p>"I want," he said, "to give you an opportunity of repaying some portion of
  that debt!"</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes to his. Her whispered words came so softly that they
  were almost inaudible.</p>

  <p>"I am waiting," she said. "Tell me what I can do!"</p>

  <p>He commenced to speak at some length, very impassively, very
  deliberately.</p>

  <p>"You will doubtless appreciate the fact," he said, "that my position,
  today, is a somewhat peculiar one. I have had enough of solitude. I am rich!
  I desire to mix once more on equal terms amongst my fellows. And against
  that, I have the misfortune to be a convicted felon, who has spent the last
  ten or a dozen years amongst the scum of the earth, engaged in degrading
  tasks, and with no identity save a number. The position, as you will
  doubtless observe, is a difficult one."</p>

  <p>Her eyes fell from his. Once more she shivered, as though with physical
  pain. Something that was like a smile, only that it was cold and lifeless,
  flitted across his lips.</p>

  <p>"I have no desire," he continued, "to live in foreign countries. On the
  contrary, I have plans which necessitate my living in England. The
  difficulties by this time are, without doubt, fully apparent to you."</p>

  <p>She said nothing. Her eyes were once more watching his face.</p>

  <p>"My looking glass," he continued, "shows me that I am changed beyond any
  reasonable chance of recognition. I do not believe that the Wingrave Seton of
  today would readily be recognized as the Wingrave Seton of twelve years ago.
  But I propose to make assurance doubly sure. I am leaving this country for
  several years, at once. I shall go to America, and I shall return as Mr.
  Wingrave, millionaire&mdash;and I propose, by the way, to make money there. I
  desire, under that identity, to take my place once more amongst my fellows. I
  shall bring letters of introduction&mdash;to you."</p>

  <p>There was a long and somewhat ominous silence! Lady Ruth's eyes were fixed
  upon the floor. She was thinking, and thinking rapidly, but there were no
  signs of it in her pale drawn face. At last she looked up.</p>

  <p>"There is my husband," she said. "He would recognize you, if no one else
  did."</p>

  <p>"You are a clever woman," he answered. "I leave it to you to deal with
  your husband as seems best to you."</p>

  <p>"Other people," she faltered, "would recognize you!"</p>

  <p>"Do me the favor," he begged her, "to look at me carefully for several
  moments. You doubtless have some imperfect recollection of what I was.
  Compare it with my present appearance! I venture to think that you will agree
  with me. Recognition is barely possible."</p>

  <p>Again there was silence. Lady Ruth seemed to have no words, but there was
  the look of a frightened child upon her face.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he continued, "that the idea does not appeal to you! I can
  understand that my presence may serve to recall a period which you and your
  husband would doubtless prefer to forget&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>A little staccato cry of pain; a cry which seemed to spring into life from
  a tortured heart, broke from her lips. Aynesworth heard it, and, at that
  moment, he hated his employer. Wingrave paused for a moment politely, and
  then continued.</p>

  <p>"But after all," he said, "I can assure you that you will find very little
  in the Mr. Wingrave of New York to remind you of the past. I shall do my
  utmost to win for myself a place in your esteem, which will help you to
  forget the other relationship, which, if my memory serves me, used once to
  exist between us!"</p>

  <p>She raised her head. Either she realized that, for the present, the man
  was immune against all sentiment, or his calm brutality had had a
  correspondingly hardening effect upon her.</p>

  <p>"If I agree," she said, "will you give me back my letters?"</p>

  <p>"No!" he answered.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with them?"</p>

  <p>"It depends," he said, "upon you. I enter into no engagement. I make no
  promises. I simply remind you that it would be equally possible for me to
  take my place in the world as a rehabilitated Wingrave Seton. Ten years ago I
  yielded to sentiment. Today I have outlived it."</p>

  <p>"Ten years ago," she murmured, "you were a hero. God knows what you are
  now!"</p>

  <p>"Exactly!" he answered smoothly. "I am free to admit that I am a puzzle to
  myself. I find myself, in fact, a most interesting study."</p>

  <p>"I consent," she said, with a little shudder. "I am going now."</p>

  <p>"You are a sensible woman," he answered. "Aynesworth, show Lady Ruth to
  her carriage."</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet. Hung from her neck by a chain of fine gold, was a
  large Chinchilla muff. She stood before him, and her hands had sought its
  shelter. Timidly she withdrew one.</p>

  <p>"Will you shake hands with me, Wingrave?" she asked timidly.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me," he said; "I may better my manners in America, but a present
  I cannot."</p>

  <p>She passed out of the room. Aynesworth followed, closing the door behind
  them. In the corridor she stumbled, and caught at his arm for support.</p>

  <p>"Don't speak to me," she gasped. "Take me where I can sit down."</p>

  <p>He found her a quiet corner in the drawing room. She sat perfectly still
  for nearly five minutes, with her eyes closed. Then she opened them, and
  looked at her companion.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Aynesworth," she said, "are you so poor that you must serve a man
  like that?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is not poverty," he answered. "I knew his history, and I am interested
  in him!"</p>

  <p>"You write novels, don't you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I try," he answered. "His story fascinated me. He stands today in a
  unique position to life. I want to see how he will come out of it."</p>

  <p>"You knew his story&mdash;the truth?"</p>

  <p>"Everything," he answered. "I heard it from a journalist who was in court,
  his only friend, the only man who knew."</p>

  <p>"Where is he now?"</p>

  <p>"On his way to Japan."</p>

  <p>She drew a little breath between her teeth.</p>

  <p>"There were rumors," she said. "It was hard for me at first, but I lived
  them down. I was very young then. I ought not to have accepted his sacrifice.
  I wish to heaven I had not. I wish that I had faced the scandal then. It is
  worse to be in the power of a man like this today! Mr. Aynesworth!"</p>

  <p>"Lady Ruth!"</p>

  <p>"Do you think that he has the right to keep those letters?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot answer that question."</p>

  <p>"Will you be my friend?"</p>

  <p>"So far as I can&mdash;in accordance with my obligations to my
  employer!"</p>

  <p>She tried him no further then, but rose and walked slowly out of the room.
  He found her maid, and saw them to their carriage. Then he returned to the
  sitting room. Wingrave was smoking a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I am trying the humanizing influence," he remarked. "Got rid of her
  ladyship?"</p>

  <p>"Lady Ruth has just gone," Aynesworth answered.</p>

  <p>"Have you promised to steal the letters yet?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Not yet!"</p>

  <p>"Her dainty ladyship has not bid high enough, I suppose," he continued.
  "Don't be afraid to open your mouth. There's another woman there besides the
  Lady Ruth Barrington, who opens bazaars, and patronizes charity, and
  entertains Royalty. Ask what you want and she'll pay!"</p>

  <p>"What a brute you are!" Aynesworth exclaimed involuntarily.</p>

  <p>"Of course I am," he admitted. "I know that. But whose fault is it? It
  isn't mine. I've lived the life of a brute creature for ten years. You don't
  abuse a one-legged man, poor devil. I've had other things amputated. I was
  like you once. It seemed all right to me to go under to save a woman's honor.
  You never have. Therefore, I say you've no right to call me a brute.
  Personally, I don't object. It is simply a matter of equity."</p>

  <p>"I admit it," Aynesworth declared. "You are acting like a brute."</p>

  <p>"Precisely. I didn't make myself what I am. Prison did it. Go and try ten
  years yourself, and you'll find you will have to grope about for your fine
  emotions. Are you coming to America with me?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," Aynesworth answered. "When do we start?"</p>

  <p>"Saturday week."</p>

  <p>"Sport west, or civilization east?"</p>

  <p>"Both," Wingrave answered. "Here is a list of the kit which we shall
  require. Add yourself the things which I have forgotten. I pay for both!"</p>

  <p>"Very good of you," Aynesworth answered.</p>

  <p>"Not at all. I don't suppose you'd come without. Can you shoot?"</p>

  <p>"A bit," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"Be particular about the rifles. I can take you to a little corner in
  Canada where the bears don't stand on ceremony. Put everything in hand, and
  be ready to come down to Cornwall with me on Monday."</p>

  <p>"Cornwall!" Aynesworth exclaimed. "What on earth are we going to do in
  Cornwall?"</p>

  <p>"I have an estate there, the home of my ancestors, which I am going to
  sell. I am the last of the Setons, fortunately, and I am going to smash the
  family tree, sell the heirlooms, and burn the family records!"</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't if I were you," Aynesworth said quietly. "You are a young man
  yet. You may come back to your own!"</p>

  <p>"Meaning?"</p>

  <p>"You may smoke enough cigarettes to become actually humanized! One can
  never tell! I have known men proclaim themselves cynics for life, who have
  been making idiots of themselves with their own children in five years."</p>

  <p>Wingrave nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"True enough," he answered. "But the one thing which no man can mistake is
  death. Listen, and I will quote some poetry to you. I think&mdash;it is
  something like this:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'The rivers of ice may melt, and the mountains crumble into dust, but the
  heart of a dead man is like the seed plot unsown. Green grass shall not
  sprout there, nor flowers blossom, nor shall all the ages of eternity show
  there any sign of life.'"</p>

  <p>He spoke as though he had been reading from a child's Primer. When he had
  finished, he replaced his cigarette between his teeth.</p>

  <p>"I am a dead man," he said calmly. "Dead as the wildest seed plot in God's
  most forgotten acre!"</p>

  <h2>VII. &mdash; LORD OF THE MANOR</h2>

  <p class="first">She came slowly towards the two men through the overgrown
  rose garden, a thin, pale, wild-eyed child, dressed in most uncompromising
  black. It was a matter of doubt whether she was the more surprised to see
  them, or they to find anyone else, in this wilderness of desolation. They
  stood face to face with her upon the narrow path.</p>

  <p>"Have you lost your way?" she inquired politely.</p>

  <p>"We were told," Aynesworth answered, "that there was a gate in the wall
  there, through which we could get on to the cliffs."</p>

  <p>"Who told you so?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"The housekeeper," Aynesworth answered. "I will not attempt to pronounce
  her name."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Tresfarwin," the child said. "It is not really difficult. But she
  had no right to send you through here! It is all private, you know!"</p>

  <p>"And you?" Aynesworth asked with a smile, "you have permission, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered. "I have lived here all my life. I go where I please.
  Have you seen the pictures?"</p>

  <p>"We have just been looking at them," Aynesworth answered.</p>

  <p>"Aren't they beautiful?" she exclaimed. "I&mdash;oh!"</p>

  <p>She sat suddenly down on a rough wooden seat and commenced to cry. For the
  first time Wingrave looked at her with some apparent interest.</p>

  <p>"Why, what is the matter with you, child?" Aynesworth exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I have loved them so all my life," she sobbed; "the pictures, and the
  house, and the gardens, and now I have to go away! I don't know where! Nobody
  seems to know!"</p>

  <p>Aynesworth looked down at her black frock.</p>

  <p>"You have lost someone, perhaps?" he said.</p>

  <p>"My father," she answered quietly. "He was organist here, and he died last
  week."</p>

  <p>"And you have no other relatives?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"None at all. No one&mdash;seems&mdash;quite to know&mdash;what is going
  to become of me!" she sobbed.</p>

  <p>"Where are you staying now?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"With an old woman who used to look after our cottage," she answered. "But
  she is very poor, and she cannot keep me any longer. Mrs. Colson says that I
  must go and work, and I am afraid. I don't know anyone except at Tredowen!
  And I don't know how to work! And I don't want to go away from the pictures,
  and the garden, and the sea! It is all so beautiful, isn't it? Don't you love
  Tredowen?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I haven't been here very long, you see," Aynesworth explained.</p>

  <p>Wingrave spoke for the first time. His eyes were fixed upon the child, and
  Aynesworth could see that she shrank from his cold, unsympathetic
  scrutiny.</p>

  <p>"What is your name?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Juliet Lundy," she answered.</p>

  <p>"How long was your father organist at the church?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she answered. "Ever since I was born, and before."</p>

  <p>"And how old are you?"</p>

  <p>"Fourteen next birthday."</p>

  <p>"And all that time," he asked, "has there been no one living at
  Tredowen?"</p>

  <p>"No one except Mrs. Tresfarwin," she answered. "It belongs to a very rich
  man who is in prison."</p>

  <p>Wingrave's face was immovable. He stood on one side, however, and turned
  towards his companion.</p>

  <p>"We are keeping this young lady," he remarked, "from what seems to be her
  daily pilgrimage. I wonder whether it is really the pictures, or Mrs.
  Tresfarwin's cakes?"</p>

  <p>She turned her shoulder upon him in silent scorn, and looked at Aynesworth
  a little wistfully.</p>

  <p>"Goodbye!" she said.</p>

  <p>He waved his hand as he strolled after Wingrave.</p>

  <p>"There you are, Mr. Lord of the Manor," he said. "You can't refuse to do
  something for the child. Her father was organist at your own church, and a
  hard struggle he must have had of it, with an absentee landlord, and a
  congregation of seagulls, I should think."</p>

  <p>"Are you joking?" Wingrave asked coldly.</p>

  <p>"I was never more in earnest in my life," Aynesworth answered. "The girl
  is come from gentlefolks. Did you see what a delicate face she had, and how
  nicely she spoke? You wouldn't have her sent out as a servant, would
  you?"</p>

  <p>Wingrave looked at his companion ominously.</p>

  <p>"You have a strange idea of the duties of a landlord," he remarked. "Do
  you seriously suppose that I am responsible for the future of every brat who
  grows up on this estate?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not!" Aynesworth answered. "You must own for yourself that this
  case is exceptional. Let us go down to the Vicarage and inquire about
  it."</p>

  <p>"I shall do nothing of the sort," Wingrave answered. "Nor will you! Do you
  see the spray coming over the cliffs there? The sea must be worth
  watching."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth walked by his side in silence. He dared not trust himself to
  speak. Wingrave climbed with long, rapid strides to the summit of the
  headland, and stood there with his face turned seawards. The long breakers
  were sweeping in from the Atlantic with a low, insistent roar; as far as the
  eye could reach the waves were crusted with white foam. Every now and then
  the spray fell around the two men in a little dazzling shower; the very
  atmosphere was salt. About their heads the seagulls whirled and shrieked.
  From the pebbled beach to the horizon there was nothing to break the monotony
  of that empty waste of waters.</p>

  <p>Wingrave stood perfectly motionless, with his eyes fixed upon the horizon.
  Minute after minute passed, and he showed no signs of moving. Aynesworth
  found himself presently engaged in watching him. Thoughts must be passing
  through his brain. He wondered what they were. It was here that he had spent
  his boyhood; barely an hour ago the two men had stood before the picture of
  his father. It was here, if anywhere, that he might regain some part of his
  older and more natural self. Was it a struggle, he wondered, that was going
  on within the man? There were no signs of it in his face. Simply he stood and
  looked, and looked, as though, by infinite perseverance, the very horizon
  itself might recede, and the thing for which he sought become
  revealed....</p>

  <p>Aynesworth turned away at last, and there, not many yards behind,
  apparently watching them, stood the child. He waved his hand and advanced
  towards her. Her eyes were fixed upon Wingrave half fearfully.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid of the other gentleman," she whispered, as he reached her
  side. "Will you come a little way with me? I will show you a seagull's
  nest."</p>

  <p>They left Wingrave where he was, and went hand in hand, along the cliff
  side. She was a curious mixture or shyness and courage. She talked very
  little, but she gripped her companion's fingers tightly.</p>

  <p>"I can show you," she said, "where the seagulls build, and I can tell you
  the very spot in the sea where the sun goes down night after night.</p>

  <p>"There are some baby seagulls in one of the nests, but I daren't go very
  near for the mother bird is so strong. Father used to say that when they have
  their baby birds to look after, they are as fierce as eagles."</p>

  <p>"Your father used to walk with you here, Juliet?" Aynesworth asked.</p>

  <p>"Always till the last few months when he got weaker and weaker," she
  answered. "Since then I come every day alone."</p>

  <p>"Don't you find it lonely?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"At first," she answered, "not now. It makes me unhappy. Would you like to
  go down on the beach and look for shells? I can find you some very pretty
  ones."</p>

  <p>They clambered down and wandered hand in hand by the seashore. She told
  him quaint little stories of the smugglers, of wrecks, and the legends of the
  fisher people. Coming back along the sands, she clung to his arm and grew
  more silent. Her eyes sought his every now and then, wistfully. Presently she
  pointed out a tiny whitewashed cottage standing by itself on a piece of waste
  ground.</p>

  <p>"That is where I live now, at least for a day or two," she said. "They
  cannot keep me any longer. When are you going away?"</p>

  <p>"Very soon, I am afraid, little girl," he answered. "I will come and see
  you, though, before I go."</p>

  <p>"You promise," she said solemnly.</p>

  <p>"I promise," Aynesworth repeated.</p>

  <p>Then she held up her face, a little timidly, and he kissed her.
  Afterwards, he watched her turn with slow, reluctant footsteps to the
  unpromising abode which she had pointed out. Aynesworth made his way to the
  inn, cursing his impecuniosity and Wingrave's brutal indifference.</p>

  <p>He found the latter busy writing letters.</p>

  <p>"Doing your work, Aynesworth?" he remarked coldly. "Be so good as to write
  to Christie's for me, and ask them to send down a valuer to go through the
  pictures."</p>

  <p>"You are really going to sell!" Aynesworth exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Most certainly," Wingrave answered. "Heirlooms and family pictures are
  only so much rubbish to me. I am the last of my line, and I doubt whether
  even my lawyer could discover a next of kin for my personal property. Sell!
  Of course I'm going to sell! What use is all this hoarded rubbish to me? I am
  going to turn it into gold!"</p>

  <p>"And what use is gold?" Aynesworth asked curiously. "You have plenty!"</p>

  <p>"Not enough for my purpose," Wingrave declared. "We are going to America
  to make more."</p>

  <p>"It's vandalism!" Aynesworth said, "rank vandalism! The place as it is is
  a picture! The furniture and the house have grown old together. Why, you
  might marry!"</p>

  <p>Wingrave scowled at the younger man across the room.</p>

  <p>"You are a fool, Aynesworth," he said shortly. "Take down these
  letters."</p>

  <p>After dinner, Wingrave went out alone. Aynesworth followed him about an
  hour later, when his work was done, and made his way towards the Vicarage. It
  was barely nine o'clock, but the little house seemed already to be in
  darkness. He rang twice before anybody answered him. Then he heard slow,
  shuffling footsteps within, and a tall, gaunt man, in clerical attire, and
  carrying a small lamp, opened the door.</p>

  <p>Aynesworth made the usual apologies and was ushered into a bare,
  gloomy-looking apartment which, from the fact of its containing a writing
  table and a few books, he imagined must be the study. His host never asked
  him to sit down. He was a long, unkempt-looking man with a cold, forbidding
  face, and his manner was the reverse of cordial.</p>

  <p>"I have called to see you," Aynesworth explained, "with reference to one
  of your parishioners&mdash;the daughter of your late organist."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" the clergyman remarked solemnly.</p>

  <p>"I saw her today for the first time and have only just heard her story,"
  Aynesworth continued. "It seems to be a very sad one."</p>

  <p>His listener inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"I am, unfortunately, a poor man," Aynesworth continued, "but I have some
  friends who are well off, and I could lay my hands upon a little ready money.
  I should like to discuss the matter with you and see if we cannot arrange
  something to give her a start in life."</p>

  <p>The clergyman cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"It is quite unnecessary," he answered. "A connection of her father's has
  come forward at the last moment, who is able to do all that is required for
  her. Her future is provided for."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth was a little taken aback.</p>

  <p>"I am very glad to hear it," he declared. "I understood that she had
  neither friends nor relations."</p>

  <p>"You were misinformed," the other answered. "She has both."</p>

  <p>"May I ask who it is who has turned up so unexpectedly?" Aynesworth
  inquired. "I have taken a great fancy to the child."</p>

  <p>The clergyman edged a little towards the door, and the coldness of his
  manner was unmistakable.</p>

  <p>"I do not wish to seem discourteous," he said, "but I cannot recognize
  that you have any right to ask me these questions. You may accept my word
  that the child is to be fittingly provided for."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth felt the color rising in his cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I trust," he said, "that you do not find my interest in her
  unwarrantable. My visit to you is simply a matter of charity. If my aid is
  unneeded, so much the better. All the same, I should like to know where she
  is going and who her friends are."</p>

  <p>"I do not find myself at liberty to afford you any information," was the
  curt reply.</p>

  <p>Thereupon there was nothing left for Aynesworth to do but to put on his
  hat and walk out, which he did.</p>

  <p>Wingrave met him in the hall on his return.</p>

  <p>"Where have you been?" he asked a little sharply.</p>

  <p>"On a private errand," Aynesworth answered, irritated by his words and
  look.</p>

  <p>"You are my secretary," Wingrave said coldly. "I do not pay you to go
  about executing private errands."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth looked at him in surprise. Did he really wish to quarrel?</p>

  <p>"I imagine, sir," he said, "that my time is my own when I have no work of
  yours on hand. If you think otherwise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused and looked at his employer significantly. Wingrave turned on his
  heel.</p>

  <p>"Be so kind," he said, "as to settle the bill here tonight. We leave by
  the seven o'clock train in the morning."</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow!" Aynesworth exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Precisely!"</p>

  <p>"Do you mind," he asked, "if I follow by a later train?"</p>

  <p>"I do," Wingrave answered. "I need you in London directly we arrive."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," Aynesworth said, after a moment's reflection, "that it is
  impossible for me to leave."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"You will think it a small thing," he said, "but I have given my promise.
  I must see that child again before I go!"</p>

  <p>"You are referring," he asked, "to the black-frocked little creature we
  saw about the place yesterday?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>Wingrave regarded his secretary as one might look at a person who has
  suddenly taken leave of his senses.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said, "to interfere with your engagements, but it is
  necessary that we should both leave by the seven o'clock train tomorrow
  morning."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth reflected for a moment.</p>

  <p>"If I can see the child first," he said, "I will come. If not, I will
  follow you at midday."</p>

  <p>"In the latter case," Wingrave remarked, "pray do not trouble to follow me
  unless your own affairs take you to London. Our connection will have
  ended."</p>

  <p>"You mean this?" Aynesworth asked.</p>

  <p>"It is my custom," Wingrave answered, "to mean what I say."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth set his alarm that night for half-past five. It seemed to him
  that his future would largely depend upon how soundly the child slept.</p>

  <h2>VIII. &mdash; THE HEART OF A CHILD</h2>

  <p class="first">The cottage, as Aynesworth neared it, showed no sign of
  life. The curtainless windows were blank and empty, no smoke ascended from
  the chimney. Its plastered front was innocent of any form of creeper, but in
  the few feet of garden in front a great, overgrown wild rose bush, starred
  with deep red blossoms, perfumed the air. As he drew near, the door suddenly
  opened, and with a little cry of welcome the child rushed out to him.</p>

  <p>"How lovely of you!" she cried. "I saw you coming from my window!"</p>

  <p>"You are up early," he said, smiling down at her.</p>

  <p>"The sun woke me," she answered. "It always does. I was going down to the
  sands. Shall we go together? Or would you like to go into the gardens at
  Tredowen? The flowers are beautiful there while the dew is on them!"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," Aynesworth answered, "that I cannot do either. I have come
  to say goodbye."</p>

  <p>The light died out of her face all of a sudden. The delicate beauty of her
  gleaming eyes and quivering mouth had vanished. She was once more the pale,
  wan little child he had seen coming slowly up the garden path at
  Tredowen.</p>

  <p>"You are going&mdash;so soon!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>He took her hand and led her away over the short green turf of the
  common.</p>

  <p>"We only came for a few hours," he told her. "But I have good news for
  you, Juliet, unless you know already. Mr. Saunders has found out some of your
  friends. They are going to look after you properly, and you will not be alone
  any more."</p>

  <p>"What time are you going?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Silly child," he answered, giving her hand a shake. "Listen to what I am
  telling you. You are going to have friends to look after you always. Aren't
  you glad?"</p>

  <p>"No, I am not glad," she answered passionately. "I don't want to go away.
  I am&mdash;lonely."</p>

  <p>Her arms suddenly sought his neck, and her face was buried on his
  shoulder. He soothed her as well as he could.</p>

  <p>"I must go, little girl," he said, "for I am off to America almost at
  once. As soon as I can after I come back, I will come and see you."</p>

  <p>"You have only been here one day," she sobbed.</p>

  <p>"I would stay if I could, dear," Aynesworth answered. "Come, dry those
  eyes and be a brave girl. Think how nice it will be to go and live with
  people who will take care of you properly, and be fond of you. Why, you may
  have a pony, and all sorts of nice things."</p>

  <p>"I don't want a pony," she answered, hanging on his arm. "I don't want to
  go away. I want to stay here&mdash;and wait till you come back."</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"Why, when I come back, little woman," he answered, "you will be almost
  grown up. Come, dry your eyes now, and I tell you what we will do. You shall
  come back with me to breakfast, and then drive up to the station and see us
  off."</p>

  <p>"I should like to come," she whispered, "but I am afraid of the other
  gentleman."</p>

  <p>"Very likely we sha'n't see him," Aynesworth answered. "If we do, he won't
  hurt you."</p>

  <p>"I don't like his face!" she persisted.</p>

  <p>"Well, we won't look at it," Aynesworth answered. "But breakfast we must
  have!"</p>

  <p>They were half way through the meal, and Juliet had quite recovered her
  spirits when Wingrave entered. He looked at the two with impassive face, and
  took his place at the table. He wished the child "Good morning" carelessly,
  but made no remark as to her presence there.</p>

  <p>"I have just been telling Juliet some good news," Aynesworth remarked. "I
  went to see Mr. Saunders, the Vicar here, last night, and he has found out
  some of her father's friends. They are going to look after her."</p>

  <p>Wingrave showed no interest in the information. But a moment later he
  addressed Juliet for the first time.</p>

  <p>"Are you glad that you are going away from Tredowen?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am very, very sorry," she answered, the tears gathering once more in
  her eyes.</p>

  <p>"But you want to go to school, don't you, and see other girls?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head decidedly.</p>

  <p>"It will break my heart," she said quietly, "to leave Tredowen. I think
  that if I have to go away from the pictures and the garden, and the sea, I
  shall never be happy any more."</p>

  <p>"You are a child," he remarked contemptuously; "you do not understand. If
  you go away, you can learn to paint pictures yourself like those at Tredowen.
  You will find that the world is full of other beautiful places!"</p>

  <p>The sympathetic aspect of his words was altogether destroyed by the thin
  note of careless irony, which even the child understood. She felt that he was
  mocking her.</p>

  <p>"I could never be happy," she said simply, "away from Tredowen. You
  understand, don't you?" she added, turning confidentially to Aynesworth.</p>

  <p>"You think so now, dear," he said, "but remember that you are very young.
  There are many things for you to learn before you grow up."</p>

  <p>"I am not a dunce," she replied. "I can talk French and German, and do
  arithmetic, and play the organ. Father used to teach me these things. I can
  learn at Tredowen very well. I hope that my friends will let me stay
  here."</p>

  <p>Wingrave took no more notice of her. She and Aynesworth walked together to
  the station. As they passed the little whitewashed cottage, she suddenly let
  go his hand, and darted inside.</p>

  <p>"Wait one moment," she cried breathlessly.</p>

  <p>She reappeared almost at once, holding something tightly clenched in her
  right hand. She showed it to him shyly.</p>

  <p>"It is for you, please," she said.</p>

  <p>It was a silver locket, and inside was a little picture of herself.
  Aynesworth stooped down and kissed her. He had had as many presents in his
  life as most men, but never an offering which came to him quite like that!
  They stood still for a moment, and he held out her hands. Already the morning
  was astir. The seagulls were wheeling, white-winged and noiseless, above
  their heads; the air was fragrant with the scent of cottage flowers. Like a
  low, sweet undernote, the sea came rolling in upon the firm sands&mdash;out
  to the west it stretched like a sheet of softly swaying inland water. For
  those few moments there seemed no note of discord&mdash;and then the harsh
  whistle of an approaching train! They took hold of hands and ran.</p>

  <p>It was, perhaps, as well that their farewells were cut short. There was
  scarcely time for more than a few hurried words before the train moved out
  from the queer little station, and with his head out of the window,
  Aynesworth waved his hand to the black-frocked child with her pale, eager
  face already stained with tears&mdash;a lone, strange little figure, full of
  a sort of plaintive grace as she stood there, against a background of milk
  cans, waving a crumpled handkerchief!</p>

  <p>Wingrave, who had been buried in a morning paper, looked up presently.</p>

  <p>"If our journeyings," he remarked drily, "are to contain everywhere
  incidents such as these, they will become a sort of sentimental
  pilgrimage."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said, "that my interest in the child has annoyed you. At
  any rate, it is over now. The parson was mysterious, but he assured me that
  she was provided for."</p>

  <p>Wingrave looked across the carriage with cold, reflective curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Your point of view," he remarked, "is a mystery to me! I cannot see how
  the future of an unfledged brat like that can possibly concern you!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," Aynesworth answered, "but you must remember that you are a
  little out of touch with your fellows just now. I daresay when you were my
  age, you would have felt as I feel. I daresay that as the years go on, you
  will feel like it again."</p>

  <p>Wingrave was thoughtful for a moment.</p>

  <p>"So you think," he remarked, "that I may yet have in me the making of a
  sentimentalist."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth returned his gaze as steadfastly.</p>

  <p>"One can never tell," he answered. "You may change, of course. I hope that
  you will."</p>

  <p>"You are candid, at any rate!"</p>

  <p>"I do not think," Aynesworth answered, "that there is any happiness in
  life for the man who lives entirely apart from his fellow creatures. Not to
  feel is not to live. I think that the first real act of kindness which you
  feel prompted to perform will mark the opening of a different life for
  you."</p>

  <p>Wingrave spread out the newspaper.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, with a faint sneer, "that it is quite time you took
  this sea voyage."</p>

  <h2>IX. &mdash; THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES</h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. Lumley Barrington, K.C. and M.P., was in the act of
  stepping into his carriage to drive down to the House, when he was
  intercepted by a message. It was his wife's maid, who came hurrying out after
  him.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir," she said, "but her ladyship particularly wished
  to see you as soon as you came in."</p>

  <p>"Is your mistress in?" Barrington asked in some surprise.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir!" the maid answered. "Her ladyship is resting, before she goes
  to the ball at Caleram House. She is in her room now."</p>

  <p>"I will come up at once," Barrington said.</p>

  <p>He kept the carriage waiting while he ascended to his wife's room. There
  was no answer to his knock. He opened the door softly. She was asleep on a
  couch drawn up before the fire.</p>

  <p>He crossed the room noiselessly, and stood looking down upon her. Her
  lithe, soft figure had fallen into a posture of graceful, almost voluptuous
  ease; the ribbons and laces of her muslin dressing gown quivered gently with
  her deep regular breathing. She had thrown off her slippers, and one long,
  slender foot was exposed; the other was doubled up underneath her body. Her
  face was almost like the face of a child, smooth and unwrinkled, save for one
  line by the eyes where she laughed. He looked at her steadfastly. Could the
  closing of the eyes, indeed, make all the difference? Life and the knowledge
  of life seemed things far from her consciousness. Could one look like
  that&mdash;even in sleep&mdash;and underneath&mdash;! Barrington broke away
  from his train of thought, and woke her quickly.</p>

  <p>She sat up and yawned.</p>

  <p>"Parsons managed to catch you, then," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" he answered. "I was just off. I got away from Wills' dinner party
  early, and called here for some notes. I must be at the House"&mdash;he
  glanced at the clock&mdash;"in three-quarters of an hour!"</p>

  <p>She nodded. "I won't keep you as long as that."</p>

  <p>Her eyes met his, a little furtively, full of inquiry. "I have done what
  you wished," he said quietly. "I called at the Clarence Hotel!"</p>

  <p>"You saw him!"</p>

  <p>"No! He sent back my card. He declined to see me."</p>

  <p>She showed no sign of disappointment. She sat up and looked into the fire,
  smoothing her hair mechanically with her hands.</p>

  <p>"Personally," Barrington continued, "I could see no object whatever in my
  visit. I have nothing to say to him, nor, I should think, he to me. I am
  sorry for him, of course, but he'd never believe me if I told him so. What
  happened to him was partly my fault, and unless he's changed, he's not likely
  to forget it."</p>

  <p>She swayed a little towards him.</p>

  <p>"It was partly&mdash;also&mdash;mine," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"I don't see that at all," he objected. "You at any rate were
  blameless!"</p>

  <p>She looked up at him, and he was astonished to find how pale she was.</p>

  <p>"I was not!" she said calmly.</p>

  <p>There was a short silence. Barrington had the air of a man who has
  received a shock.</p>

  <p>"Ruth!" he exclaimed, glancing towards the door, and speaking almost in a
  whisper. "Do you mean&mdash;that there are things which I have never
  known?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" she answered. "I mean that he might, if he chose, do us
  now&mdash;both of us&mdash;an immense amount of harm."</p>

  <p>Barrington sat down at the end of the sofa. He knew his wife well enough
  to understand that this was serious.</p>

  <p>"Let us understand one another, Ruth," he said quietly. "I always thought
  that you were a little severe on Wingrave at the trial! He may bear you a
  grudge for that; it is very possible that he does. But what can he do now? He
  had his chance to cross examine you, and he let it go by."</p>

  <p>"He has some letters of mine," Lady Ruth said slowly.</p>

  <p>"Letters! Written before the trial?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"Why did he not make use of them there?"</p>

  <p>"If he had," Lady Ruth said, with her eyes fixed upon the carpet, "the
  sympathy would have been the other way. He would have got off with a much
  lighter sentence, and you&mdash;would not have married me!"</p>

  <p>"Good God!" Barrington muttered.</p>

  <p>"You see," Lady Ruth continued, resting her hand upon her husband's coat
  sleeve, "the thing happened all in a second. I had the check in my hand when
  you and Sir William came crashing through that window, and Sir William's eyes
  were upon me. The only way to save myself was to repudiate it, and let
  Wingrave get out of the affair as well as he could. Of course, I never
  guessed what was going to happen."</p>

  <p>"Then it was Wingrave," Barrington muttered, "who played the game?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Lady Ruth answered quietly. "But I am not so sure about him now.
  You and I, Lumley, know one another a little better today than we did twelve
  years ago. We have had a few of the corners knocked off, I suppose. I can
  tell you things now I didn't care to then. Wingrave had lent me money before!
  He has letters from me today, thanking him for it."</p>

  <p>Barrington was a large, florid man, well built and well set up. In court
  he presented rather a formidable appearance with his truculent chin, his
  straight, firm mouth, and his commanding presence. Yet there was nothing
  about him now which would have inspired fear in the most nervous of
  witnesses. He looked like a man all broken up by some unexpected shock.</p>

  <p>"If he had produced those letters&mdash;at the trial&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I risked it, anyhow," she said. "I had to. My story was the only one
  which gave me a dog's chance, and I didn't mean to go under&mdash;then.
  Wingrave never gave me away, but I fancy he's feeling differently about it
  now!"</p>

  <p>"How do you know, Ruth?"</p>

  <p>"I have seen him! He sent for me!" she answered. "Lumley, don't look at me
  like that! We're not in the nursery, you and I. I went because I had to. He's
  going to America for a time, and then he's coming back here. I think that
  when he comes back&mdash;he means mischief!"</p>

  <p>"He is not the sort of man to forget," Barrington said, half to
  himself.</p>

  <p>She shuddered ever so slightly. Then she stretched out a long white arm,
  and drawing his head suddenly down to her, kissed him on the lips.</p>

  <p>"If only," she murmured, "he would give up the letters! Without them, he
  might say&mdash;anything. No one would believe!"</p>

  <p>Barrington raised his eyes to hers. There was something almost pathetic in
  the worshiping light which shone there. He was, as he had always been, her
  abject slave.</p>

  <p>"Can you think of any way?" he asked. "Shall I go to him again?"</p>

  <p>"Useless!" she answered. "You have nothing to offer in exchange. He would
  not give them to me. He surely would not give them to you. Shall I tell you
  what is in his mind? Listen, then! He is rich now; he means to make more
  money there. Then he will return, calling himself Mr. Wingrave&mdash;an
  American&mdash;with imaginary letters of introduction to us. He has
  ambitions&mdash;I don't know what they are, but they seem to entail his
  holding some sort of a place in society. We are to be his sponsors."</p>

  <p>"Is it practicable?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Quite," she answered. "He is absolutely unrecognizable now. He has
  changed cruelly. Can't you imagine the horror of it? He will be always in
  evidence; always with those letters in the background. He means to make life
  a sort of torture chamber for us!"</p>

  <p>"Better defy him at once, and get over," Barrington said. "After all,
  don't you think that the harm he could do is a little imaginary?"</p>

  <p>She brushed the suggestion aside with a little shiver.</p>

  <p>"Shall I tell you what he would do, Lumley?" she said, leaning towards
  him. "He would have my letters, and a copy of my evidence, printed in an
  elegant little volume and distributed amongst my friends. It would come one
  day like a bomb, and nothing that you or I could do would alter it in the
  least. Your career and my social position would be ruined. Success brings
  enemies, you know, Lumley, and I have rather more than my share."</p>

  <p>"Then we are helpless," he said.</p>

  <p>"Unless we can get the letters&mdash;or unless he should never return from
  America," she answered.</p>

  <p>Barrington moved uneasily in his seat. He knew very well that some scheme
  was already forming in his wife's brain.</p>

  <p>"If there is anything that I can do," he said in a low tone, "don't be
  afraid to tell me."</p>

  <p>"There is one chance," she answered, "a sort of forlorn hope, but you
  might try it. He has a secretary, a young man named Aynesworth. If he were on
  our side&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't you think," Barrington interrupted, "that you would have more
  chance with him than I?"</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"You foolish man," she said, touching his fingers lightly. "I believe you
  think that I am irresistible!"</p>

  <p>"I have seen a good many lions tamed," he reminded her.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! Anyhow, there is one here who seems quite insensible. I have
  talked already with Mr. Aynesworth. He would not listen to me!"</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," she continued softy, "of one thing I am very sure. Every
  man is like every woman; he is vulnerable if you can discover the right spot
  and the right weapons. Mr. Aynesworth is not a woman's man, but I fancy that
  he is ambitious. I thought that you might go and see him. He has rooms
  somewhere in Dorset Street."</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet. A glance at the clock reminded him of the hour.</p>

  <p>"I will go," he said. "I will do what I can. I think, dear," he added,
  bending over her to say farewell, "that you should have been the man!"</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Am I such a failure as a woman, then?" she asked with a swift upward
  glance. "Don't be foolish, Lumley. My woman will be here to dress me
  directly. You must really go away."</p>

  <p>He strode down the stairs with tingling pulses, and drove to the House,
  where his speech, a little florid in its rhetoric, and verbose as became the
  man, was nevertheless a great success.</p>

  <p>"Quite a clever fellow, Barrington," one of his acquaintances remarked,
  "when you get him away from his wife."</p>
  <hr>

     id="ch1-10"><!--Chapter Anchor--></a></p>

  <h2>X. &mdash; A FORLORN HOPE</h2>

  <p class="first">Aynesworth ceased tugging at the strap of his portmanteau,
  and rose slowly to his feet. A visitor had entered his rooms&mdash;apparently
  unannounced.</p>

  <p>"I must apologize," the newcomer said, "for my intrusion. Your
  housekeeper, I presume it was, whom I saw below, told me to come up."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth pushed forward a chair.</p>

  <p>"Won't you sit down?" he said. "I believe that I am addressing Mr. Lumley
  Barrington."</p>

  <p>Not altogether without embarrassment, Barrington seated himself. Something
  of his ordinary confidence of bearing and demeanor had certainly deserted
  him. His manner, too, was nervous. He had the air of being altogether ill at
  ease.</p>

  <p>"I must apologize further, Mr. Aynesworth," he continued, "for an
  apparently ill-timed visit. You are, I see, on the eve of a journey."</p>

  <p>"I am leaving for America tomorrow," Aynesworth answered.</p>

  <p>"With Sir Wingrave Seton, I presume?" Barrington remarked.</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Aynesworth answered.</p>

  <p>Barrington hesitated for a moment. Aynesworth was civil, but inquiring. He
  felt himself very awkwardly placed.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Aynesworth," he said, "I must throw myself upon your consideration.
  You can possibly surmise the reason of my visit."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, "that I must plead guilty to denseness&mdash;in
  this particular instance, at any rate. I am altogether at a loss to account
  for it."</p>

  <p>"You have had some conversation with my wife, I believe?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Before you proceed, Mr. Aynesworth," Barrington interrupted, "one word.
  You are aware that Sir Wingrave Seton is in possession of certain documents
  in which my wife is interested, which he refuses to give up?"</p>

  <p>"I have understood that such is the case," Aynesworth admitted. "Will you
  pardon me if I add that it is a matter which I can scarcely discuss?"</p>

  <p>Barrington shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Let it go, for the moment," he said. "There is something else which I
  want to say to you."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth nodded a little curtly. He was not very favorably impressed
  with his visitor.</p>

  <p>"Well!"</p>

  <p>Barrington leaned forward in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Aynesworth," he said, "you have made for yourself some reputation as
  a writer. Your name has been familiar to me for some time. I was at college,
  I believe, with your uncle, Stanley Aynesworth."</p>

  <p>He paused. Aynesworth said nothing.</p>

  <p>"I want to know," Barrington continued impressively, "what has induced you
  to accept a position with such a man as Seton?"</p>

  <p>"That," Aynesworth declared, "is easily answered. I was not looking for a
  secretaryship at all, or anything of the sort, but I chanced to hear his
  history one night, and I was curious to analyze, so far as possible, his
  attitude towards life and his fellows, on his reappearance in it. That is the
  whole secret."</p>

  <p>Barrington leaned back in his chair, and glanced thoughtfully at his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"You know the story of his misadventures, then?" he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I know all about his imprisonment, and the cause of it," Aynesworth said
  quietly.</p>

  <p>Barrington was silent for several moments. He felt that he was receiving
  but scanty encouragement.</p>

  <p>"Is it worth while, Mr. Aynesworth?" he asked at length. "There is better
  work for you in the world than this."</p>

  <p>Again Aynesworth preferred to reply by a gesture only. Barrington was
  watching him steadily.</p>

  <p>"A political secretaryship, Mr. Aynesworth," he said, "might lead you
  anywhere. If you are ambitious, it is the surest of all stepping stones into
  the House. After that, your career is in your own hands. I offer you such a
  post."</p>

  <p>"I am exceedingly obliged to you," Aynesworth replied, "but I scarcely
  understand."</p>

  <p>"I have influence," Barrington said, "which I have never cared to use on
  my own account. I am willing to use it on yours. You have only to say the
  word, and the matter is arranged."</p>

  <p>"I can only repeat," Aynesworth said, "that I am exceedingly obliged to
  you, Mr. Barrington, but I cannot understand why you should interest yourself
  so much on my behalf."</p>

  <p>"If you wish me to speak in plain words," Barrington said, "I will do so.
  I ask you to aid me as a man of honor in the restoration of those letters to
  my wife."</p>

  <p>"I cannot do it," Aynesworth said firmly. "I am sorry that you should have
  come to me with such an offer. It is quite out of the question!"</p>

  <p>Barrington held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Do not decide too hastily," he said. "Remember this. Sir Wingrave Seton
  had once an opportunity of putting those letters to any use he may have
  thought fit. He ignored it. At that time, their tenor and contents might
  easily have been explained. After all these years, that task would be far
  more difficult. I say that no man has a right to keep a woman's letters back
  from her years after any friendship there may have been between them is over.
  It is not the action of an honorable man. Sir Wingrave Seton has placed
  himself outside the pale of honorable men."</p>

  <p>"Your judgment," Aynesworth answered quietly, "seems to me severe. Sir
  Wingrave Seton has been the victim of peculiar circumstances."</p>

  <p>Barrington looked at his companion thoughtfully. He was wondering exactly
  how much he knew.</p>

  <p>"You defend him," he remarked. "That is because you have not yet found out
  what manner of man he is."</p>

  <p>"In any case," Aynesworth answered, "I am not his judge. Mr. Barrington,"
  he added, "You must forgive me if I remind you that this is a somewhat
  unprofitable discussion."</p>

  <p>A short silence followed. With Barrington it did not appear to be a
  silence of irresolution. He was leaning a little forward in his chair, and
  his head was resting upon his hand. Of his companion he seemed for the moment
  to have become oblivious. Aynesworth watched him curiously. Was he looking
  back through the years, he wondered, to that one brief but lurid chapter of
  history; or was it his own future of which he was thinking,&mdash;a future
  which, to the world, must seem so full of brilliant possibilities, and yet
  which he himself must feel to be so fatally and miserably insecure?</p>

  <p>"Mr. Aynesworth," he said at last, "I suppose from a crude point of view I
  am here to bribe you."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Is it worth while?" he asked a little wearily. "I have tried to be
  civil&mdash;but I have also tried to make you understand. Your task is
  absolutely hopeless!"</p>

  <p>"It should not be," Barrington persisted. "This is one of those rare
  cases, in which anything is justifiable. Seton had his chance at the trial.
  He chose to keep silence. I do not praise him or blame him for that. It was
  the only course open to a man of honor. I maintain that his silence then
  binds him to silence for ever. He has no right to ruin my life and the
  happiness of my wife by subtle threats, to hold those foolish letters over
  our heads, like a thunderbolt held ever in suspense. You are ambitious, I
  believe, Mr. Aynesworth! Get me those letters, and I will make you my
  secretary, find you a seat in Parliament, and anything else in reason that
  you will!"</p>

  <p>Aynesworth rose to his feet. He wished to intimate that, so far as he was
  concerned, the interview was at an end.</p>

  <p>"Your proposition, Mr. Barrington," he said, "is absolutely impossible. In
  the first place, I have no idea where the letters in question are, and Sir
  Wingrave is never likely to suffer them to pass into my charge."</p>

  <p>"You have opportunities of finding out," Barrington suggested.</p>

  <p>"And secondly," Aynesworth continued, ignoring the interruption, "whatever
  the right or the wrong of this matter may be, I am in receipt of a salary
  from Sir Wingrave Seton, and I cannot betray his confidence."</p>

  <p>Barrington also rose to his feet. He was beginning to recognize the
  hopelessness of his task.</p>

  <p>"This is final, Mr. Aynesworth?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely!" was the firm reply.</p>

  <p>Barrington bowed stiffly, and moved towards the door. On the threshold he
  paused.</p>

  <p>"I trust, Mr. Aynesworth," he said hesitatingly, "that you will not regard
  this as an ordinary attempt at bribery and corruption. I have simply asked
  you to aid me in setting right a great injustice."</p>

  <p>"It is a subtle distinction, Mr. Barrington," Aynesworth answered, "but I
  will endeavor to keep in mind your point of view."</p>

  <p>Barrington drove straight home, and made his way directly to his study.
  Now that he was free from his wife's influence, and looked back upon his
  recent interview, he realized for the first time the folly and indignity of
  the whole proceedings. He was angry that, a man of common sense, keen witted
  and farseeing in the ordinary affairs of life, should have placed himself so
  completely in a false, not to say a humiliating position. And then, just as
  suddenly, he forgot all about himself, and remembered only her. With a breath
  of violets, and the delicate rustling of half-lifted skirts, she had come
  softly into the room, and stood looking at him inquiringly. Her manner seemed
  to indicate more a good-natured curiosity than real anxiety. She made a
  little grimace as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I have failed," he said shortly. "That young man is a prig!"</p>

  <p>"I was afraid," she said, "that he would be obstinate. Men with eyes of
  that color always are!"</p>

  <p>"What are we to do, Ruth?"</p>

  <p>"What can we?" she answered calmly. "Nothing but wait. He is going to
  America. It is a terrible country for accidents. Something may happen to him
  there! Do go and change your things, there's a dear, and look in at the
  Westinghams' for me for an hour. We'll just get some supper and come
  away."</p>

  <p>"I will be ready in ten minutes," Barrington answered. He understood that
  he was to ask no questions, nor did he. But all the time his man was hurrying
  him into his clothes, his brain was busy weaving fancies.</p>

  <h2>XI. &mdash; PROFESSOR SINCLAIR'S DANCING ACADEMY</h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. Sinclair, or as he preferred to be called, Professor
  Sinclair, waved a white kid glove in the direction of the dancing hall.</p>

  <p>"This way, ladies and gentlemen!" he announced. "A beautiful valse just
  about to commence. Tickets, if you please! Ah! Glad to see you, Miss
  Cullingham! You'll find&mdash;a friend of yours inside!"</p>

  <p>There was a good deal of giggling as the girls came out from the little
  dressing room and joined their waiting escorts, who stood in a line against
  the wall, mostly struggling with refractory gloves. Mr. Sinclair, proprietor
  of the West Islington Dancing Academy, and host of these little
  gatherings&mdash;for a consideration of eighteenpence&mdash;did his best, by
  a running fire of conversation, to set everyone at their ease. He wore a
  somewhat rusty frock coat, black trousers, a white dress waistcoat, and a red
  tie. Evening dress was not DE RIGUEUR! The money at the door, and that
  everyone should behave as ladies and gentlemen, were the only things insisted
  upon.</p>

  <p>Mr. Sinclair's best smile and most correct bow was suddenly in
  evidence.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle Violet!" he exclaimed to a lady who came in alone, "we are
  enchanted. We feared that you had deserted us. There is a young gentleman
  inside who is going to be made very happy. One shilling change, thank you.
  Won't you step into the cloak room?"</p>

  <p>The lady shook her head.</p>

  <p>"If you don't mind, Mr. Sinclair," she said, "I would rather keep my hat
  and veil on. I can only stay for a few minutes. Is Mr. Richardson here, do
  you know? Ah! I can see him."</p>

  <p>She stepped past the Professor into the little dancing hall. A young lady
  was pounding upon a piano, a boy at her side was playing the violin. A few
  couples were dancing, but most of the company was looking on. The evening was
  young, and Mr. Sinclair, who later on officiated as M.C., had not yet made
  his attack upon the general shyness. The lady known as Mademoiselle Violet
  paused and looked around her. Suddenly she caught sight of a pale,
  anemic-looking youth, who was standing apart from the others, lounging
  against the wall. She moved rapidly towards him.</p>

  <p>"How do you do, Mr. Richardson?" she said, holding out her hand.</p>

  <p>He started, and a sudden rush of color streamed into his cheeks. He took
  her hand awkwardly, and he was almost speechless with nervousness.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you're at all glad to see me!" she remarked.</p>

  <p>"Oh! Miss Violet!" he exclaimed. He would have said more, but the words
  stuck in his throat.</p>

  <p>"Can we sit down somewhere?" she said. "I want to talk to you."</p>

  <p>There were one or two chairs placed behind a red drugget curtain, where
  adventurous spirits led their partners later in the evening. They found a
  place there, and the young man recovered his power of speech.</p>

  <p>"Not glad to see you!" he exclaimed almost vehemently. "Why, what else do
  you suppose I come here for every Thursday evening? I never dance; they all
  make game of me because they know I come here on the chance of seeing you
  again. I'm a fool! I know that! You just amuse yourself here with me, and
  then you go away, back to your friends&mdash;and forget! And I hang about
  round here, like the silly ass that I am!"</p>

  <p>"My dear&mdash;George!"</p>

  <p>The young man blushed at the sound of his Christian name. He was mollified
  despite himself.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it's got to be the same thing all over again," he declared
  resignedly. "You'll talk to me and let me be near you&mdash;and make a fool
  of me all round; and then you'll go away, and heaven knows when I'll see you
  again. You won't let me take you home, and won't tell me where you live, or
  who your friends are. You do treat me precious badly, Miss Violet."</p>

  <p>"This time," she said quietly, "it will not be the same. I have something
  quite serious to say to you."</p>

  <p>"Something serious&mdash;you? Go on!" he exclaimed in excitement.</p>

  <p>"Have you found another place yet?"</p>

  <p>"No. I haven't really tried. I have a little money saved, and I could get
  one tomorrow if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped him with a smiling gesture.</p>

  <p>"I don't mean that&mdash;yet," she said. "I wanted to know whether it
  would be possible for you to go away for a little time, if someone paid all
  your expenses."</p>

  <p>"To go away!" he repeated blankly. "What for?"</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Violet leaned a little nearer to him.</p>

  <p>"My mistress asked me yesterday," she said, "if I knew anyone who could be
  trusted who would go away, at a moment's notice, on an errand for her."</p>

  <p>"Your mistress," he repeated. "You really are a lady's maid, then, are
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course!" she answered impatiently. "Haven't I told you so before? Now
  what do you say? Will you go?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno," he answered thoughtfully. "If it had been for you, I don't know
  that I'd have minded. I ain't fond of traveling."</p>

  <p>"It is for me," she interrupted hastily. "If I can find her anyone who
  will do what she wants, she will make my fortune. She has promised. And
  then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, and then?"</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Violet looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I should not make any promises," she said demurely, "but things would
  certainly be different."</p>

  <p>The young man's blood was stirred. Mademoiselle Violet stood to him for
  the whole wonderful world of romance, into which he had peered dimly from
  behind the counter of an Islington emporium. Her low voice&mdash;so strange
  to his ears after the shrill chatter of the young ladies of his
  acquaintance&mdash;the mystery of her coming and going, all went to give
  color to the single dream of his unimaginative life. Apart from her, he was a
  somewhat vulgar, entirely commonplace young man, of saving habits, and with
  some aptitude for business, in a small way. He had been well on his way to
  becoming a small but successful shopkeeper, thereby realizing the only ideals
  which had yet presented themselves to him, when Madame Violet had
  unconsciously intervened. Of what might become of him now he had no clear
  conception of himself.</p>

  <p>"I'll go!" he declared.</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Violet's eyes flashed behind her veil. Her fingers touched
  his for a moment.</p>

  <p>"It is a long way," she said.</p>

  <p>"I don't care," he answered valiantly.</p>

  <p>"To&mdash;America!"</p>

  <p>"America!" he gasped. "But&mdash;is this a joke, Miss Violet?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Of course not! America is not a great journey."</p>

  <p>"But it will cost&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"My mistress is very rich," she said. "The cost does not matter at all.
  You will have all the money you can spend&mdash;and more."</p>

  <p>He felt himself short of breath, and bereft of words.</p>

  <p>"Gee whiz!" he murmured.</p>

  <p>They sat there in silence for a few moments. A promenading couple put
  their heads behind the screen, and withdrew with the sound of feminine
  giggling. Outside, the piano was being thumped to the tune of a popular
  polka.</p>

  <p>"But what have I go to do?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"To watch a man who will go out by the same steamer as you," she answered.
  "Write to London, tell me what he does, how he spends his time, whether he is
  ill or well. You must stay at the same hotel in New York, and try and find
  out what his business is there. Remember, we want to know, my mistress and I,
  everything that he does."</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" he asked. "A friend of your mistress?"</p>

  <p>"No!" she answered shortly, "an enemy. A cruel enemy&mdash;the cruelest
  enemy a woman could have!"</p>

  <p>The subdued passion of her tone thrilled him. He felt himself
  bewildered&mdash;in touch with strange things. She leaned a little closer
  towards him, and that mysterious perfume, which was one of her many
  fascinations, dazed him with its sweetness.</p>

  <p>"If you could send home word," she whispered, "that he was ill, that
  anything had happened to him, that he was not likely to return&mdash;our
  fortunes would be made&mdash;yours and mine."</p>

  <p>"Stop!" he muttered. "You&mdash;phew! It's hot here!"</p>

  <p>He wiped the perspiration recklessly from his forehead with a red silk
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"What made you come to me?" he asked. "I don't even know the name of your
  mistress."</p>

  <p>"And you must not ask it," she declared quietly. "It is better for you not
  to know. I came to you because you were a man, and I knew that I could trust
  you."</p>

  <p>Her flattery sank into his soul. No one else had ever called him a man. He
  felt himself capable of great things. To think that, but for the coming of
  this wonderful Mademoiselle Violet, he might even now have been furnishing a
  small shop on the outskirts of Islington, with collars and ties and gloves
  designed to attract the youth of that populous neighborhood!</p>

  <p>"When do I start?" he asked with a coolness which surprised himself.</p>

  <p>She drew a heavy packet from the recesses of the muff she carried.</p>

  <p>"All the particulars are here," she said. "The name of the steamer, the
  name of the man, and money. You will be told where to get more in New York,
  if you need it."</p>

  <p>He took it from her mechanically. She rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>"You will remember," she said, looking into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I ain't likely to forget anything you've said tonight," he answered
  honestly. "But look here! Let me take you home&mdash;just this once! Give me
  something to think about."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I will give you something to hope for," she whispered. "You must not come
  a yard with me. When you come back it will, perhaps&mdash;be different."</p>

  <p>He remained behind the partition, gripping the packet tightly.
  Mademoiselle Violet took a hasty adieu of Mr. Sinclair, and descended to the
  street. She walked for a few yards, and then turned sharply to the left. A
  hansom, into which she stepped at once, was waiting there. She wrapped
  herself hastily in a long fur coat which lay upon the seat, and thrust her
  hand through the trap door.</p>

  <p>"St. Martin's Schoolroom!" she told the cabman.</p>

  <p>Apparently Mademoiselle Violet combined a taste for philanthropy with her
  penchant for Islington dancing halls. She entered the little schoolroom and
  made her way to the platform, dispensing many smiles and nods amongst the
  audience of the concert, which was momentarily interrupted for her benefit.
  She was escorted on to the platform by a young and earnest-looking clergyman,
  and given a chair in the center of the little group who were gathered there.
  And after the conclusion of the song, the clergyman expressed his
  gratification to the audience that a lady with so many calls upon her time,
  such high social duties, should yet find time to show her deep interest in
  their welfare by this most kind visit. After which, he ventured to call upon
  Lady Barrington to say a few words.</p>

  <h2>XII. &mdash; MEPHISTOPHELES ON A STEAMER</h2>

  <p class="first">In some respects, the voyage across the Atlantic was a
  surprise to Aynesworth. His companion seemed to have abandoned, for the time
  at any rate, his habit of taciturnity. He conversed readily, if a little
  stiffly, with his fellow passengers. He divided his time between the smoke
  room and the deck, and very seldom sought the seclusion of his state room.
  Aynesworth remarked upon this change one night as the two men paced the deck
  after dinner.</p>

  <p>"You are beginning to find more pleasure," he said, "in talking to
  people."</p>

  <p>Wingrave shook his head.</p>

  <p>"By no means," he answered coldly. "It is extremely distasteful to
  me."</p>

  <p>"Then why do you do it?" Aynesworth asked bluntly.</p>

  <p>Wingrave never objected to being asked questions by his secretary. He
  seemed to recognize the fact that Aynesworth's retention of his post was due
  to a desire to make a deliberate study of himself, and while his own attitude
  remained purely negative, he at no time exhibited any resentment or
  impatience.</p>

  <p>"I do it for several reasons," he answered. "First, because misanthropy is
  a luxury in which I cannot afford to indulge. Secondly, because I am really
  curious to know whether the time will ever return when I shall feel the
  slightest shadow of interest in any human being. I can only discover this by
  affecting a toleration for these people's society, which I can assure you, if
  you are curious about the matter, is wholly assumed."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Surely," he said, "you find Mrs. Travers entertaining?"</p>

  <p>Wingrave reflected for a moment.</p>

  <p>"You mean the lady with a stock of epigrams, and a green veil?" he
  remarked. "No! I do not find her entertaining."</p>

  <p>"Your neighbor at table then, Miss Packe?"</p>

  <p>"If my affections have perished," Wingrave answered grimly, "my taste, I
  hope, is unimpaired. The young person who travels to improve her mind, and
  fills up the gaps by reading Baedeker on the places she hasn't been to, fails
  altogether to interest me!"</p>

  <p>"Aren't you a little severe?" Aynesworth remarked.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," Wingrave answered, "that it depends upon the point of view,
  to use a hackneyed phrase. You study people with a discerning eye for good
  qualities. Nature&mdash;and circumstances have ordered it otherwise with me.
  I see them through darkened glasses."</p>

  <p>"It is not the way to happiness," Aynesworth said.</p>

  <p>"There is no highroad to what you term happiness," Wingrave answered. "One
  holds the string and follows into the maze. But one does not choose one's
  way. You are perhaps more fortunate than I that you can appreciate Mrs.
  Travers' wit, and find my neighbor, who has done Europe, attractive. That is
  a matter of disposition."</p>

  <p>"I should like," Aynesworth remarked, "to have known you fifteen years
  ago."</p>

  <p>Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I fancy," he said, "that I was a fairly average person&mdash;I mean that
  I was possessed of an average share of the humanities. I have only my memory
  to go by. I am one of those fortunate persons, you see, who have realized an
  actual reincarnation. I have the advantage of having looked out upon life
  from two different sets of windows.&mdash;By the bye, Aynesworth, have you
  noticed that unwholesome-looking youth in a serge suit there?"</p>

  <p>Aynesworth nodded.</p>

  <p>"What about him?"</p>

  <p>"I fancy that he must know&mdash;my history. He sits all day long smoking
  bad cigarettes and watching me. He makes clumsy attempts to enter into
  conversation with me. He is interested in us for some reason or other."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth nodded.</p>

  <p>"Shocking young bounder," he remarked. "I've noticed him myself."</p>

  <p>"Talk to him some time, and find out what he means by it," Wingrave said.
  "I don't want to find my biography in the American newspapers. It might
  interfere with my operations there. Here's this woman coming to worry us! You
  take her off, Aynesworth! I shall go into the smoking room."</p>

  <p>But Mrs. Travers was not so easily to be disposed of. For some reason or
  other, she had shown a disposition to attach herself to Wingrave.</p>

  <p>"Please put me in my chair," she said to him, holding out her rug and
  cushion. "No! Not you, Mr. Aynesworth. Mr. Wingrave understands so much
  better how to wrap me up. Thanks! Won't you sit down yourself? It's much
  better for you out here than in the smoking room&mdash;and we might go on
  with our argument."</p>

  <p>"I thought," Wingrave remarked, accepting her invitation after a moment's
  hesitation, "that we were to abandon it."</p>

  <p>"That was before dinner," she answered, glancing sideways at him. "I feel
  braver now."</p>

  <p>"You are prepared," he remarked, "for unconditional surrender?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him again. She had rather nice eyes, quite dark and very
  soft, and she was a great believer in their efficacy.</p>

  <p>"Of my argument?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer her for a moment. He had turned his head slightly
  towards her, and though his face was, as usual, expressionless, and his eyes
  cold and hard, she found nevertheless something of meaning in his steady
  regard. There was a flush in her cheek when she looked away.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," she remarked, "that you are rather a terrible person."</p>

  <p>"You flatter me," he murmured. "I am really quite harmless!"</p>

  <p>"Not from conviction then, I am sure," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," he admitted. "Let us call it from lack of enterprise! The
  virtues are all very admirable things, but it is the men and women with vices
  who have ruled the world. The good die young because there is no useful work
  for them to do. No really satisfactory person, from a moral point of view,
  ever achieved greatness!"</p>

  <p>She half closed her eyes.</p>

  <p>"My head is going round," she murmured. "What an upheaval! Fancy
  Mephistopheles on a steamer!"</p>

  <p>"He was, at any rate, the most interesting of that little trio," Wingrave
  remarked, "but even he was a trifle heavy."</p>

  <p>"Do you go about the world preaching your new doctrines?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Not I!" he answered. "Nothing would every make a missionary of me, for
  good or for evil, for the simple reason that no one else's welfare except my
  own has the slightest concern for me."</p>

  <p>"What hideous selfishness!" she said softly. "But I don't think&mdash;you
  quite mean it?"</p>

  <p>"I can assure you I do," he answered drily. "My world consists of myself
  for the central figure, and the half a dozen or so of people who are useful
  or amusing to me! Except that the rest are needed to keep moving the
  machinery of the world, they might all perish, so far as I was
  concerned."</p>

  <p>"I don't think," Mrs. Travers said softly, "that I should like to be in
  your world."</p>

  <p>"I can very easily believe you," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Unless," she remarked tentatively, "I came to convert!"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"There is something in that," he admitted. "It would be a great work, a
  little difficult, you know."</p>

  <p>"All the more interesting!"</p>

  <p>"You see," he continued, "I am not only bad, but I admire badness. My wish
  is to remain bad&mdash;in fact, I should like to be worse if I knew how. You
  would find it hard to make a start. I couldn't even admit that a state of
  goodness was desirable!"</p>

  <p>She looked at him curiously. The night air was perhaps getting colder, for
  she shivered, and drew the rug a little closer around her.</p>

  <p>"You speak like a prophet," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"A prophet of evil then!"</p>

  <p>She looked at him steadfastly. The lightness had gone out of her tone.</p>

  <p>"Do you know," she said, "I am almost sorry that I ever knew you?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You can't mean it," he declared.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"I have done you the greatest service one human being can render another!
  I have saved you from being bored!"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"That may be true," she admitted. "But can you conceive no worse state in
  the world than being bored?"</p>

  <p>"There is no worse state," he answered drily. "I was bored once," he
  added, "for ten years or so; I ought to know!"</p>

  <p>"Were you married?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not quite so bad as that," he answered. "I was in prison!"</p>

  <p>She turned a startled face towards him.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!"</p>

  <p>"It is perfectly true," he said coolly. "Are you horrified?"</p>

  <p>"What did you do?" she asked in a low tone.</p>

  <p>"I killed a man."</p>

  <p>"Purposely?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"He attacked me! I had to defend myself."</p>

  <p>She said nothing for several moments.</p>

  <p>"Shall I go?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No! Sit still," she answered. "I am frightened of you, but I don't want
  you to go away. I want to think.... Yes! I can understand you better now!
  Your life was spoilt!"</p>

  <p>"By no means," he answered. "I am still young! I am going to make up for
  those ten years."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You cannot," she answered. "The years can carry no more than their
  ordinary burden of sensations. If you try to fill them too full, you lose
  everything."</p>

  <p>"I shall try what I can do!" he remarked calmly.</p>

  <p>She rose abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid of you tonight," she said. "I am going downstairs. Will you
  give my rug and cushion to the deck steward? And&mdash;good night."</p>

  <p>She gave him her hand, but she did not look at him, and she hurried away a
  little abruptly.</p>

  <p>Wingrave yawned, and lighting a cigar, strolled up and down the deck. A
  figure loomed out of the darkness and almost ran into him. It was the young
  man in the serge suit. He muttered a clumsy apology and hurried on.</p>

  <h2>XIII. &mdash; A COCKNEY CONSPIRATOR</h2>

  <p class="first">"The bar closes in ten minutes, sir!" the smoking room
  steward announced.</p>

  <p>The young man who had been the subject of Wingrave's remarks hastily
  ordered another drink, although he had an only half-emptied tumbler in front
  of him. Presently he stumbled out on to the deck. It was a dark night, and a
  strong head wind was blowing. He groped his way to the railing and leaned
  over, with his head half buried in his hands. Below, the black tossing sea
  was churned into phosphorescent spray, as the steamer drove onwards into the
  night.</p>

  <p>Was it he indeed&mdash;George Richardson? He doubted it. The world of tape
  measures and calico counters seemed so far away; the interior of his quondam
  lodgings in a by-street of Islington, so unfamiliar and impossible. He felt
  himself swallowed up in this new and bewildering existence, of which he was
  so insignificant an atom, the existence where tragedy reared her gloomy head,
  and the shadows of great things loomed around him. Down there in the cold
  restless waste of black waters&mdash;what was it that he saw? The sweat broke
  out upon his forehead, the blood seemed turned to ice in his veins. He knew
  very well that his fancy mocked him, that it was not indeed a man's white
  face gleaming on the crest of the waves. But none the less he was
  terrified.</p>

  <p>Mr. Richardson was certainly nervous. Not all the brandy he had
  drunk&mdash;and he had never drunk half as much before in his
  life&mdash;afforded him the least protection from these ghastly fancies. The
  step of a sailor on the deck made him shiver; the thought of his empty state
  room was a horror. He tried to think of the woman at whose bidding he had
  left behind him Islington and the things that belonged to Islington! He tried
  to recall her soft suggestive whispers, the glances which promised more even
  than her spoken words, all the perfume and mystery of her wonderful presence.
  Her very name was an allurement. Mademoiselle Violet! How softly it fell from
  the lips!... God in heaven, what was that? He started round, trembling in
  every limb. It was nothing more than the closing of the smoking room door
  behind him. Sailors with buckets and mops were already beginning their
  nightly tasks. He must go to his state room! Somehow or other, he must get
  through the night...</p>

  <p>He did it, but he was not a very prepossessing looking object when he
  staggered out on deck twelve hours later, into the noon sunshine. The chair
  towards which he looked so eagerly was occupied. He scarcely knew himself
  whether that little gulp of acute feeling, which shot through his veins, was
  of relief or disappointment. While he hesitated, Wingrave raised his
  head.</p>

  <p>Wingrave did not, as a rule, speak to his fellow passengers. Of
  Richardson, he had not hitherto taken the slightest notice. Yet this morning,
  of all others, he addressed him.</p>

  <p>"I believe," he said, holding it out towards him, "that this envelope is
  yours. I found it under your chair."</p>

  <p>Richardson muttered something inarticulate, and almost snatched it away.
  It was the envelope of the fatal letter which Mademoiselle Violet had written
  him to Queenstown.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Mr. Richardson, if you are not in a hurry," Wingrave continued
  calmly. "I was hoping that I might see you this morning. Can you spare me a
  few minutes?"</p>

  <p>Richardson subsided into his chair. His heart was thumping against his
  ribs. Wingrave's voice sounded to him like a far-off thing.</p>

  <p>"The handwriting upon that envelope which I have just restored to you, Mr.
  Richardson, is well known to me," Wingrave continued, gazing steadfastly at
  the young man whom he was addressing.</p>

  <p>"The envelope! The handwriting!" Richardson faltered. "I&mdash;it was
  from&mdash;"</p>

  <p>An instant's pause. Wingrave raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he said. "We need not mention the lady's name. That she should be a
  correspondent of yours, however, helps me to understand better several
  matters which have somewhat puzzled me lately. No! Don't go, my dear sir. We
  must really have this affair straightened out."</p>

  <p>"What affair?" Richardson demanded, with a very weak attempt at bluster.
  "I don't understand you&mdash;don't understand you at all."</p>

  <p>Wingrave leaned a little forward in his chair. His eyebrows were drawn
  close together; his gaze was entirely merciless.</p>

  <p>"You are not well this morning," he remarked. "A little headache perhaps!
  Won't you try one of these phenacetine lozenges&mdash;excellent things for a
  headache, I believe? Warranted, in fact, to cure all bodily ailments for
  ever! What! You don't like the look of them?"</p>

  <p>The young man cowered back in his chair. He was gripping the sides tightly
  with both hands, and the pallor of a ghastly fear had spread over his
  face.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;don't know what you mean," he faltered. "I haven't a
  headache!"</p>

  <p>Wingrave looked thoughtfully at the box between his fingers.</p>

  <p>"If you took one of these, Mr. Richardson," he said, "you would never have
  another, at any rate. Now, tell me, sir, how you came by them!"</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about&mdash;" the young man began.</p>

  <p>"Don't lie to me, sir," Wingrave said sharply. "I have been wondering what
  the &mdash;&mdash; you meant by hanging around after me, giving the deck
  steward five shillings to put your chair next mine, and pretending to read,
  while all the time you were trying to overhear any scraps of conversation
  between my secretary and myself. I thought you were simply guilty of
  impertinent curiosity. This, however, rather alters the look of affairs."</p>

  <p>"What does?" Richardson asked faintly. "That box ain't mine."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," Wingrave answered, "but you found it in my state room and
  filled it up with its present contents. My servant saw you coming out, and
  immediately went in to see what you had stolen, and report you. He found
  nothing missing, but he found this box full of lozenges, which he knows quite
  well was half full before you went in. Now, what was your object, Mr.
  Richardson, in tampering with that box upon my shelf?"</p>

  <p>"I have&mdash;I have never seen it before," Richardson declared. "I have
  never been in your state room!"</p>

  <p>The deck steward was passing. Wingrave summoned him.</p>

  <p>"I wish you would ask my servant to step this way," he said. "You will
  find him in my state room."</p>

  <p>The man disappeared through the companion way. Richardson rose to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to stay here to be bullied and cross examined," he
  declared. "I'm off!"</p>

  <p>"One moment," Wingrave said. "If you leave me now, I shall ask the captain
  to place you under arrest."</p>

  <p>Richardson looked half fearfully around.</p>

  <p>"What for?"</p>

  <p>"Attempted murder! Very clumsily attempted, but attempted murder none the
  less."</p>

  <p>The young man collapsed. Wingrave's servant came down the deck.</p>

  <p>"You sent for me, sir?" he inquired respectfully.</p>

  <p>Wingrave pointed towards his companion.</p>

  <p>"Was that the person whom you saw coming out of my state room?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes sir," the man replied at once.</p>

  <p>"You could swear to him, if necessary?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

  <p>"That will do, Morrison."</p>

  <p>The man withdrew. Wingrave turned to his victim. "A few weeks ago," he
  remarked, "I had a visit from the lady whose handwriting is upon that
  envelope. I had on the table before me a box of phenacetine lozenges. She
  naturally concluded that I was in the habit of using them. That lady has
  unfortunately cause to consider me, if not an enemy, something very much like
  it. You are in correspondence with her. Only last night you placed in my box
  of these lozenges some others, closely resembling them, but fortunately a
  little different in shape. Mine were harmless&mdash;as a matter of fact, a
  single one of yours would kill a man in ten minutes. Now, Mr. Richardson,
  what have you to say about all this? Why should I not send for the captain,
  and have you locked up till we arrive at New York?"</p>

  <p>Richardson drew his handkerchief across his damp forehead.</p>

  <p>"You can't prove nothing," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that I must differ from you," Wingrave answered. "We will see
  what the captain has to say."</p>

  <p>He leaned forward in his chair, to attract the attention of a seaman.</p>

  <p>Richardson interposed.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said thickly. "Suppose I own up! What then?"</p>

  <p>"A few questions&mdash;nothing terrifying. I am not very frightened of
  you."</p>

  <p>"Go on!"</p>

  <p>"How did you become acquainted with the writer of that letter?"</p>

  <p>Richardson hesitated.</p>

  <p>"She came to a dancing class at Islington," he said.</p>

  <p>Wingrave's face was expressionless, but his tone betrayed his
  incredulity.</p>

  <p>"A dancing class at Islington! Nonsense!"</p>

  <p>"Mind," the young man asserted, "it was her mistress who put her up to
  this! It was nothing to do with her. It was for her mistress's sake."</p>

  <p>"Do you know the mistress?" Wingrave asked.</p>

  <p>"No; I don't know her name even. Never heard it."</p>

  <p>"Your letter, then, was from the maid?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, it was," Richardson answered. "If you recognize the writing,
  you must know that yourself."</p>

  <p>Wingrave looked reflectively seaward. The matter was not entirely clear to
  him. Yet he was sure that this young man was telling the truth, so far as he
  could divine it.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "you have made your attempt and failed. If fortune had
  favored you, you might at this moment have been a murderer. I might have
  warned you, by the bye, that I am an exceedingly hard man to kill."</p>

  <p>Richardson looked uneasily around.</p>

  <p>"I ain't admitting anything, you know," he said.</p>

  <p>"Precisely! Well, what are you going to do now? Are you satisfied with
  your first reverse, or are you going to renew the experiment?"</p>

  <p>"I've had enough," was the dogged answer. "I've been made a fool of. I can
  see that. I shall return home by the next steamer. I never ought to have got
  mixed up in this."</p>

  <p>"I am inclined to agree with you," Wingrave remarked calmly. "Do I
  understand that if I choose to forget this little episode, you will return to
  England by the next steamer?"</p>

  <p>"I swear it," Richardson declared.</p>

  <p>"And in the meantime, that you make no further attempt of a similar
  nature?"</p>

  <p>"Not I!" he answered with emphasis. "I've had enough."</p>

  <p>"Then," Wingrave said, "we need not prolong this conversation. Forgive my
  suggesting, Mr. Richardson, that whilst I am on deck, the other side of the
  ship should prove more convenient for you!"</p>

  <p>The young man rose, and without a word staggered off. Wingrave watched him
  through half-closed eyes, until he disappeared.</p>

  <p>"It was worth trying," he said softly to himself. "A very clever woman
  that! She looks forward through the years, and she sees the clouds gathering.
  It was a little risky, and the means were very crude. But it was worth
  trying!"</p>

  <h2>XIV. &mdash; THE MOTH AND THE CANDLE</h2>

  <p class="first">"Tomorrow morning," Aynesworth remarked, "we shall
  land."</p>

  <p>Wingrave nodded.</p>

  <p>"I shall not be sorry," he said shortly.</p>

  <p>Aynesworth fidgeted about. He had something to say, and he found it
  difficult. Wingrave gave him no encouragement. He was leaning back in his
  steamer chair, with his eyes fixed upon the sky line. Notwithstanding the
  incessant companionship of the last six days, Aynesworth felt that he had not
  progressed a single step towards establishing any more intimate relations
  between his employer and himself.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Travers is not on deck this afternoon," he remarked a trifle
  awkwardly.</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" Wingrave answered. "I hadn't noticed."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth sat down. There was nothing to be gained by fencing.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to talk about her, sir, if I might," he said.</p>

  <p>Wingrave withdrew his eyes from the sea, and looked at his companion in
  cold surprise.</p>

  <p>"To me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes! I thought, the first few days, that Mrs. Travers was simply a vain
  little woman of the world, perfectly capable of taking care of herself, and
  heartless enough to flirt all day long, if she chose, without any risk, so
  far as she was concerned. I believe I made a mistake!"</p>

  <p>"This is most interesting," Wingrave said calmly, "but why talk to me
  about the lady? I fancy that I know as much about her as you do."</p>

  <p>"Very likely; but you may not have realized the same things. Mrs. Travers
  is a married woman, with a husband in Boston, and two little children, of
  whom, I believe, she is really very fond. She is a foolish, good-natured
  little woman, who thinks herself clever because her husband has permitted her
  to travel a good deal, and has evidently been rather fascinated by the
  latitudinarianism of continental society. She is a little afraid of being
  terribly bored when she gets back to Boston, and she is very
  sentimental."</p>

  <p>"I had no idea," Wingrave remarked, "that you had been submitting the lady
  and her affairs to the ordeal of your marvelous gift of analysis. I rather
  fancied that you took no interest in her at all."</p>

  <p>"I did not," Aynesworth answered, "until last night."</p>

  <p>"And last night?" he repeated questioningly.</p>

  <p>"I found her on deck&mdash;crying. She had been tearing up some
  photographs, and she talked a little wildly. I talked to her then for a
  little time."</p>

  <p>"Can't you be more explicit?" Wingrave asked.</p>

  <p>Aynesworth looked him in the face.</p>

  <p>"She gave me the impression," he said, "that she did not intend to return
  to her husband."</p>

  <p>Wingrave nodded.</p>

  <p>"And what have you to say to me about this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I have no right to say anything, of course," Aynesworth answered. "You
  might very properly tell me that it is no concern of mine. Mrs. Travers has
  already compromised herself, to some extent, with the people on board who
  know her and her family. She never leaves your side for a moment if she can
  help it, and for the last two or three days she has almost followed you
  about. You may possibly derive some amusement from her society for a short
  time, but&mdash;afterwards!"</p>

  <p>"Explain yourself exactly," Wingrave said.</p>

  <p>"Is it necessary?" Aynesworth declared brusquely. "Talk sensibly to her!
  Don't encourage her if she should really be contemplating anything
  foolish!"</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, hang it all!" Aynesworth declared. "I'm not a moralist, but she's a
  decent little woman. Don't ruin her life for the sake of a little
  diversion!"</p>

  <p>Wingrave, who had been holding a cigar case in his hand for the last few
  minutes, opened it, and calmly selected a cigar.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you a little melodramatic, Aynesworth?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Sounds like it, no doubt," his companion answered, "but after all, hang
  it, she's not a bad little sort, and you wouldn't care to meet her in
  Piccadilly in a couple of years' time."</p>

  <p>Wingrave turned a little in his chair. There was a slight hardening of the
  mouth, a cold gleam in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"That," he remarked, "is precisely where you are wrong. I am afraid you
  have forgotten our previous conversations on this or a similar subject.
  Disconnect me in your mind at once from all philanthropic notions! I desire
  to make no one happy, to assist at no one's happiness. My own life has been
  ruined by a woman. Her sex shall pay me where it can. If I can obtain from
  the lady in question a single second's amusement, her future is a matter of
  entire indifference to me. She can play the repentant wife, or resort to the
  primeval profession of her sex. I should not even have the curiosity to
  inquire which."</p>

  <p>"In that case," Aynesworth said slowly, "I presume that I need say no
  more."</p>

  <p>"Unless it amuses you," Wingrave answered, "it really is not worth
  while."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," Aynesworth remarked, "it is as well that I should tell you
  this. I shall put the situation before Mrs. Travers exactly as I see it. I
  shall do my best to dissuade her from any further or more intimate
  intercourse with you."</p>

  <p>"At the risk, of course," Wingrave said, "of my offering
  you&mdash;this?"</p>

  <p>He drew a paper from his pocket book, and held it out. It was the return
  half of a steamer ticket.</p>

  <p>"Even at that risk," Aynesworth answered without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Wingrave carefully folded the document, and returned it to his pocket.</p>

  <p>"I am glad," he said, "to find that you are so consistent. There is Mrs.
  Travers scolding the deck steward. Go and talk to her! You will scarcely find
  a better opportunity."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth rose at once. Wingrave in a few moments also left his seat, but
  proceeded in the opposite direction. He made his way into the purser's room,
  and carefully closed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Travers greeted Aynesworth without enthusiasm. Her eyes were resting
  upon the empty place which Wingrave had just vacated.</p>

  <p>"Can I get your chair for you, Mrs. Travers," Aynesworth asked, "or shall
  we walk for a few minutes?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Travers hesitated. She looked around, but there was obviously no
  escape for her.</p>

  <p>"I should like to sit down," she said. "I am very tired this morning. My
  chair is next Mr. Wingrave's there."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth found her rug and wrapped it around her. She leaned back and
  closed her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I shall try to sleep," she said. "I had such a shocking night."</p>

  <p>He understood at once that she was on her guard, and he changed his
  tactics.</p>

  <p>"First," he said, "may I ask you a question?"</p>

  <p>She opened her eyes wide, and looked at him. She was afraid.</p>

  <p>"Not now," she said hurriedly. "This afternoon."</p>

  <p>"This afternoon I may not have the opportunity," he answered. "Is your
  husband going to meet you at New York, Mrs. Travers?"</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"Are you going direct to Boston?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him steadily. There was a slight flush of color in her
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I find your questions impertinent, Mr. Aynesworth," she answered.</p>

  <p>There was a short silence. Aynesworth hated his task and hated himself.
  But most of all, he pitied the woman who sat by his side.</p>

  <p>"No!" he said, "they are not impertinent. I am the looker-on, you know,
  and I have seen&mdash;a good deal. If Wingrave were an ordinary sort of man,
  I should never have dared to interfere. If you had been an ordinary sort of
  woman, I might not have cared to."</p>

  <p>She half rose in her chair.</p>

  <p>"I shall not stay here," she began, struggling with her rug.</p>

  <p>"Do!" he begged. "I am&mdash;I want to be your friend, really!"</p>

  <p>"You are supposed to be his," she reminded him.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I am his secretary. There is no question of friendship between us. For
  the rest, I told him that I should speak to you."</p>

  <p>"You have no right to discuss me at all," she declared vehemently.</p>

  <p>"None whatever," he admitted. "I have to rely entirely upon your mercy.
  This is the truth. People are thrown together a good deal on a voyage like
  this. You and Mr. Wingrave have seen a good deal of one another. You are a
  very impressionable woman; he is a singularly cold, unimpressionable man. You
  have found his personality attractive. You fancy&mdash;other things. Wingrave
  is not the man you think he is. He is selfish and entirely without
  affectionate impulses. The world has treated him badly, and he has no
  hesitation in saying that he means to get some part of his own back again. He
  does not care for you, he does not care for anyone. If you should be
  contemplating anything ridiculous from a mistaken judgment of his character,
  it is better that you should know the truth."</p>

  <p>The anger had gone. She was pale again, and her lips were trembling.</p>

  <p>"Men seldom know one another," she said softly. "You judge from the
  surface only."</p>

  <p>"Mine is the critical judgment of one who has studied him intimately,"
  Aynesworth said. "Yours is the sentimental hope of one fascinated by what she
  does not understand. Wingrave is utterly heartless!"</p>

  <p>"That," she answered steadfastly, "I do not believe."</p>

  <p>"You do not because you will not," he declared. "I have spoken because I
  wish to save you from doing what you would repent of for the rest of your
  days. You have the one vanity which is common to all women. You believe that
  you can change what, believe me, is unchangeable. To Wingrave, women are less
  than playthings. He owes the unhappiness of his life to one, and he would see
  the whole of her sex suffer without emotion. He is impregnable to sentiment.
  Ask him and I believe that he would admit it!"</p>

  <p>She smiled and regarded him with the mild pity of superior knowledge.</p>

  <p>"You do not understand Mr. Wingrave," she remarked.</p>

  <p>Aynesworth sighed. He realized that every word he had spoken had been
  wasted upon this pale, pretty woman, who sat with her eyes now turned
  seawards, and the smile still lingering upon her lips. Studying her for a
  moment, he realized the danger more acutely than ever before. The fretfulness
  seemed to have gone from her face, the weary lines from her mouth. She had
  the look of a woman who has come into the knowledge of better things. And it
  was Wingrave who had done this! Aynesworth for the first time frankly hated
  the man. Once, as a boy, he had seen a keeper take a rabbit from a trap and
  dash its brains out against a tree. The incident flashed then into his mind,
  only the face of the keeper was the face of Wingrave!</p>

  <h2>XV. &mdash; "DEVIL TAKE THE HINDMOST"</h2>

  <p class="first">Wingrave and Aynesworth were alone in a private room of the
  Waldorf Astoria Hotel. The table at which the former was seated was covered
  with letters and papers. A New York directory and an atlas were at his
  elbow.</p>

  <p>"I propose," Wingrave said, leaning back in his chair, "to give you some
  idea of the nature of my business in this country. You will be able then, I
  trust, to carry out my instructions more intelligibly."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth nodded.</p>

  <p>"I thought," he said, "that you came here simply to remain in seclusion
  for a time."</p>

  <p>"That is one of my reasons," Wingrave admitted, "but I had a special
  purpose in coming to America. During my&mdash;enforced seclusion&mdash;I made
  the acquaintance of a man called Hardwell. He was an Englishman, but he had
  lived in America for some years, and had got into trouble over some company
  business. We had some conversation, and it is upon his information that I am
  now going to act."</p>

  <p>"He is trustworthy?" Aynesworth asked.</p>

  <p>"I take the risk," Wingrave answered coolly. "There is a small copper mine
  in Utah called the Royal Hardwell Copper Mine. The shares are hundred dollar
  ones, and there are ten thousand of them. They are scarcely quoted now, as
  the mine has become utterly discredited. Hardwell managed this himself with a
  false report. He meant to have the company go into liquidation, and then buy
  it for a very small amount. As a matter of fact, the mine is good, and could
  be worked at a large profit."</p>

  <p>"You have Hardwell's word for that," Aynesworth remarked.</p>

  <p>"Exactly!" Wingrave remarked. "I am proceeding on the assumption that he
  told me the truth. I wish to buy, if possible, the whole of the shares, and
  as many more as I can get brokers to sell. The price of the shares today is
  two dollars!"</p>

  <p>"I presume you will send out an expert to the mine first?" Aynesworth
  said.</p>

  <p>"I shall do nothing of the sort," Wingrave answered. "The fact that I was
  buying upon information would send the shares up at once. I mean to buy
  first, and then go out to the mine. If I have made a mistake, I shall not be
  ruined. If Hardwell's story is true, there will be millions in it."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth said nothing, but his face expressed a good deal.</p>

  <p>"Here are the names of seven respectable brokers," Wingrave continued,
  passing a sheet of paper towards him. "I want you to buy five hundred shares
  from each of them. The price may vary a few points. Whatever it is, pay it.
  Here are seven signed checks. I shall buy myself as many as I can without
  spoiling the market. You had better start out in about a quarter of an hour
  and see to this. You have my private ledger?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Open an account to Hardwell in it; a quarter of all the shares I buy are
  to be in his name, and a quarter of all the profits I make in dealing in the
  shares is to be credited to him."</p>

  <p>"A fairly generous arrangement for Mr. Hardwell," Aynesworth remarked.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing generous about it," Wingrave answered coldly. "It is the
  arrangement I made with him, and to which I propose to adhere. You understand
  what I want you to do?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," Aynesworth answered; "I still think, however, that much the
  wiser course would be to send an expert to the mine first."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" Wingrave remarked politely. "That is all, I think. I shall
  expect to see you at luncheon time. If you are asked questions as to why you
  are dealing in these shares to such an extent, you can say that the friend
  for whom you are acting desires to boom copper, and is going on the low price
  of the metal at the moment. They will think you a fool, and perhaps may not
  trouble to conceal their opinion after they have finished the business. You
  must endeavor to support the character. I have no doubt but that you will be
  successful."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth moved towards the door.</p>

  <p>Once more Wingrave called him back. He was leaning a little forward across
  the table. His face was very set and cold.</p>

  <p>"There is a question which I wish to ask you, Aynesworth," he said. "It
  concerns another matter altogether. Do you know who sent the Marconigram to
  Dr. Travers, which brought him to New York to meet his wife?"</p>

  <p>"I do not," Aynesworth answered.</p>

  <p>"It was sent by someone on board the ship," Wingrave continued. "You have
  no suspicion as to whom it could have been?"</p>

  <p>"None!" Aynesworth answered firmly. "At the same time, I do not mind
  telling you this. If I had thought of it, I would have sent it myself."</p>

  <p>Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It is perhaps fortunate for the continuation of our mutual relations that
  you did not think of it," he remarked quietly. "I accept your denial. I shall
  expect you back at one o'clock."</p>

  <p>At a few minutes after that hour the two men sat down to luncheon.
  Wingrave at that time was the possessor of six thousand shares in the Royal
  Hardwell Copper Mine, which had cost him, on an average, two dollars
  twenty-five. The news of the dealing, however, had got about, and although
  derision was the chief sentiment amongst the brokers, the price steadily
  mounted. A dozen telegrams were sent out to the mine, and on receipt of the
  replies, the dealing became the joke of the day. The mine was still deserted,
  and no fresh inspection had been made. The price dropped a little. Then
  Wingrave bought a thousand more by telephone, and it rose again to four. A
  few minutes before closing time, he threw every share of which he was
  possessed upon the market, and the next morning Royal Hardwells stood at one
  dollar seventy-five.</p>

  <p>For a week Wingrave pursued the same tactics, and at the end of that time
  he had made twenty thousand dollars. The brokers, however, now understood, or
  thought they understood, the situation. No one bought for the rise; they were
  all sellers. Wingrave at once changed his tactics. He bought five thousand
  shares in one block, and sold none. Even then, the market was only mildly
  amused. In a fortnight he was the nominal owner of sixteen thousand shares in
  a company of which only ten thousand actually existed. Then he sat still, and
  the panic began. The shares in a company which everyone believed to be
  worthless stood at thirty dollars, and not a share was offered.</p>

  <p>A small pandemonium reigned in Wingrave's sitting room. The telephone rang
  all the time; the place was besieged with brokers. Then Wingrave showed his
  hand. He had bought these shares to hold; he did not intend to sell one. As
  to the six thousand owed to him beyond the number issued, he was prepared to
  consider offers. One broker left him a check for twenty thousand dollars,
  another for nearly forty thousand. Wingrave had no pity. He had gambled and
  won. He would accept nothing less than par price. The air in his sitting room
  grew thick with curses and tobacco smoke.</p>

  <p>Aynesworth began by hating the whole business, but insensibly the
  fascination of it crept over him. He grew used to hearing the various forms
  of protest, of argument and abuse, which one and all left Wingrave so
  unmoved. Sphinx-like he lounged in his chair, and listened to all. He never
  condescended to justify his position, he never met argument by argument. He
  had the air of being thoroughly bored by the whole proceedings. But he
  exacted always his pound of flesh.</p>

  <p>On the third afternoon, Aynesworth met on the stairs a young broker, whom
  he had come across once or twice during his earlier dealings in the shares.
  They had had lunch together, and Aynesworth had taken a fancy to the
  boy&mdash;he was little more&mdash;fresh from Harvard and full of enthusiasm.
  He scarcely recognized him for a moment. The fresh color had gone from his
  cheeks, his eyes were set in a fixed, wild stare; he seemed suddenly aged.
  Aynesworth stopped him.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Nesbitt!" he exclaimed. "What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>The young man would have passed on with a muttered greeting, but
  Aynesworth turned round with him, and led the way into one of the smaller
  smoking rooms. He called for drinks and repeated his question.</p>

  <p>"Your governor has me six hundred Hardwells short," Nesbitt answered
  curtly.</p>

  <p>"Six hundred! What does it mean?" Aynesworth asked.</p>

  <p>"Sixty thousand dollars, or thereabouts," the young man answered
  despairingly. "His brokers won't listen to me, and your governor&mdash;well,
  I've just been to see him. I won't call him names! And we thought that some
  fool of an Englishman was burning his fingers with those shares. I'm not the
  only one caught, but the others can stand it. I can't, worse luck!"</p>

  <p>"I'm beastly sorry," Aynesworth said truthfully. "I wish I could help
  you."</p>

  <p>Nesbitt raised his head. A sudden light flashed in his eyes; he spoke
  quickly, almost feverishly.</p>

  <p>"Say, Aynesworth," he exclaimed, "do you think you could do anything with
  your governor for me? You see&mdash;it's ruin if I have to pay up. I wouldn't
  mind&mdash;for myself, but I was married four months ago, and I can't bear
  the thought of going home&mdash;and telling her. All the money we have
  between us is in my business, and we've got no rich friends or anything of
  that sort. I don't know what I'll do if I have to be hammered. I've been so
  careful, too! I didn't want to take this on, but it seemed such a soft thing!
  If I could get off with twenty thousand, I'd keep my head up. I hate to talk
  like this. I'd go down like a man if I were alone, but&mdash;but&mdash;oh!
  Confound it all&mdash;!" he exclaimed with an ominous break in his tone.</p>

  <p>Aynesworth laid his hand upon the boy's arm.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "I'll try what I can do with Mr. Wingrave. Wait
  here!"</p>

  <p>Aynesworth found his employer alone with his broker, who was just
  hastening off to keep an appointment. He plunged at once into his appeal.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Wingrave," he said, "you have just had a young broker named Nesbitt
  on."</p>

  <p>Wingrave glanced at a paper by his side.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said. "Six hundred short! I wish they wouldn't come to me."</p>

  <p>"I've been talking to him downstairs," Aynesworth said. "This will break
  him."</p>

  <p>"Then I ought not to have done business with him at all," Wingrave said
  coolly. "If he cannot find sixty thousand dollars, he has no right to be in
  Wall street. I daresay he'll pay, though! They all plead
  poverty&mdash;curs!"</p>

  <p>"I think Nesbitt's case is a little different from the others," Aynesworth
  continued. "He is quite young, little more than a boy, and he has only just
  started in business. To be hammered would be absolute ruin for him. He seems
  such a decent young fellow, and he's only just married. He's in an awful
  state downstairs. I wish you'd have another talk with him. I think you'd feel
  inclined to let him down easy."</p>

  <p>Wingrave smiled coldly.</p>

  <p>"My dear Aynesworth," he said, "you astonish me. I am not interested in
  this young man's future or in his matrimonial arrangements. He has gambled
  with me and lost. I presume that he would have taken my money if I had been
  the fool they all thought me. As it is, I mean to have his&mdash;down to the
  last cent!"</p>

  <p>"He isn't like the others," Aynesworth protested doggedly. "He's only a
  boy&mdash;and it seems such jolly hard luck, doesn't it, only four months
  married! New York hasn't much pity for paupers. He looks mad enough to blow
  his brains out. Have him up, sir, and see if you can't compromise!"</p>

  <p>"Fetch him," Wingrave said curtly.</p>

  <p>Aynesworth hurried downstairs. The boy was walking restlessly up and down
  the room. The look he turned upon Aynesworth was almost pitiful.</p>

  <p>"He'll see you again," Aynesworth said hurriedly. "Come along."</p>

  <p>The boy wrung his hand.</p>

  <p>"You're a brick!" he declared.</p>

  <h2>XVI. &mdash; THE HIDDEN HAND</h2>

  <p class="first">Wingrave glanced up as they entered. He motioned Nesbitt to
  a chair by his side, but the young man remained standing.</p>

  <p>"My secretary tells me," Wingrave said curtly, "that you cannot pay me
  what you owe."</p>

  <p>"It's more than I possess in the world, sir," Nesbitt answered.</p>

  <p>"It is not a large amount," Wingrave said. "I do not see how you can carry
  on business unless you can command such a sum as this."</p>

  <p>Nesbitt moistened his dry lips with his tongue.</p>

  <p>"I have only been doing a very small business, sir," he answered, "but
  quite enough to make a living. I don't speculate as a rule. Hardwells seemed
  perfectly safe, or I wouldn't have touched them. I sold at four. They are not
  worth one. I could have bought thousands last week for two dollars."</p>

  <p>"That is beside the question," Wingrave answered. "If you do not pay this,
  you have cheated me out of my profits for I should have placed the commission
  with brokers who could. Why did you wish to see me again?"</p>

  <p>"I thought that you might give me time," Nesbitt answered, raising his
  head and looking Wingrave straight in the face. "It seems rather a low down
  thing to come begging. I'd rather cut my right hand off than do it for
  myself, but I've&mdash;someone else to think about, and if I'm hammered, I'm
  done for. Give me a chance, Mr. Wingrave! I'll pay you in time."</p>

  <p>"What do you ask for?" Wingrave said.</p>

  <p>"I thought that you might give me time," Nesbitt said, "and I'll pay you
  the rest off with the whole of my profits every year."</p>

  <p>"A most absurd proposal," Wingrave said coolly. "I will instruct my
  brokers to take twenty thousand dollars down, and wait one week for the
  balance. That is the best offer I can make you. Good day!"</p>

  <p>The young man stood as though he were stunned.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I can't find it," he faltered. "I can't indeed."</p>

  <p>"Your resources are not my affair," Wingrave said. "I shall instruct my
  broker to do as I have said. If the money is not forthcoming, you know the
  alternative."</p>

  <p>"You mean to ruin me, then?" Nesbitt said slowly.</p>

  <p>"I mean to exact the payment of what is due to me," Wingrave said curtly.
  "If you cannot pay, it seems to me that I am the person to be
  pitied&mdash;not you. Show Mr. Nesbitt out, Aynesworth."</p>

  <p>Nesbitt turned towards the door. He was very pale, but he walked steadily.
  He did not speak another word to Wingrave.</p>

  <p>"I'm beastly sorry," Aynesworth said to him on the stairs. "I wish I could
  help you!"</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Nesbitt answered. "No one can help me. I'm through."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth returned to the sitting room. Wingrave had lit a cigarette and
  watched him as he arranged some papers.</p>

  <p>"Quite a comedy, isn't it?" he remarked grimly.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't present itself in that light to me," Aynesworth answered.</p>

  <p>Wingrave blew the smoke away from in front of his face. "Ah!" he said, "I
  forgot that you were a sentimentalist. I look upon these things from my own
  point of view. From yours, I suppose I must seem a very disagreeable person.
  I admit frankly that the sufferings of other people do not affect me in the
  slightest."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry for you," Aynesworth said shortly. "If there is going to be
  much of this sort of thing, though, I must ask you to relieve me of my post.
  I can't stand it."</p>

  <p>"Whenever you like, my dear fellow," Wingrave answered. "I think that you
  would be very foolish to leave me, though. I must be a most interesting
  study."</p>

  <p>"You are&mdash;what the devil made you!" Aynesworth muttered.</p>

  <p>Wingrave laid down his cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I am what my fellows have made me," he said slowly. "I tasted hell for a
  good many years. It has left me, I suppose, with a depraved taste. Ring up my
  brokers, Aynesworth! I want to speak to Malcolmson. He had better come round
  here."</p>

  <p>The day dragged on. Aynesworth hated it all, and was weary long before it
  was half over. Everyone who came was angry, and a good many came whom
  Wingrave refused to see. Just before five o'clock, young Nesbitt entered the
  room unannounced. Aynesworth started towards him with a little exclamation.
  The young man's evident excitement terrified him, and he feared a tragedy.
  Malcolmson, too, half rose to his feet. Wingrave alone remained unmoved.</p>

  <p>Nesbitt walked straight up to the table at which Malcolmson and Wingrave
  were sitting. He halted in front of the latter.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Wingrave," he said, "you will give me my receipt for those shares for
  fifty-seven thousand six hundred dollars."</p>

  <p>Wingrave turned to a paper by his side, and ran his forefinger down the
  list of names.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Nesbitt," he said. "Yes! sixty thousand dollars."</p>

  <p>The young man laid a slip of paper upon the table.</p>

  <p>"That is a certified check for the amount," he said. "Mr. Malcolmson,
  please give me my receipt."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Mr. Wingrave remarked. "I thought that you would find the
  money."</p>

  <p>Nesbitt bit his lip, but he said nothing till he had the receipt and had
  fastened it up in his pocket. Then he turned suddenly round upon
  Wingrave.</p>

  <p>"Look here!" he said. "You've got your money. I don't owe you a cent. Now
  I'm going to tell you what I think of you."</p>

  <p>Wingrave rose slowly to his feet. He was as tall as the boy, long, lean,
  and hard. His face expressed neither anger nor excitement, but there was a
  slight, dangerous glitter in his deep-set eyes.</p>

  <p>"If you mean," he said, "that you are going to be impertinent, I would
  recommend you to change your mind."</p>

  <p>Nesbitt for a moment hesitated. There was something ominous in the cool
  courage of the older man. And before he could collect himself, Wingrave
  continued:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I presume," he said, "that you chose your own profession. You knew quite
  well there was no place in it for men with a sense of the higher morality. It
  is a profession of gamblers and thieves. If you'd won, you'd have thought
  yourself a smart fellow and pocketed your winnings fast enough. Now that
  you've lost&mdash;don't whine. You sat down willingly enough to play the game
  with me. Don't call me names because you lost. This is no place for children.
  Pocket your defeat, and be more careful next time."</p>

  <p>Nesbitt was silent for a moment. Wingrave, cool and immovable, dominated
  him. He gave a little laugh, and turned towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Guess you're right," he declared; "we'll let it go at that."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth followed him from the room.</p>

  <p>"I'm awfully glad you're out of the scrape," he said.</p>

  <p>Nesbitt caught him by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Come right along," he said. "I haven't had a drink in the daytime for a
  year, but we're going to have a big one now. I say, do you know how I got
  that money?"</p>

  <p>Aynesworth shook his head.</p>

  <p>"On easy terms, I hope."</p>

  <p>They sat down in the American Bar, and a colored waiter in a white linen
  suit brought them whisky and Apollinaris in tall tumblers.</p>

  <p>"Listen," Nesbitt said. "My brain is on the reel still. I went back to my
  office, and if it hadn't been for the little girl, I should have brought a
  revolver by the way. Old Johnny there waiting to see me, no end of a swell,
  Phillson, the uptown lawyer. He went straight for me.</p>

  <p>"'Been dealing in Hardwells?' he asked.</p>

  <p>"I nodded.</p>

  <p>"'Short, eh?'</p>

  <p>"'Six hundred shares,' I answered. There was no harm in telling him for
  the Street knew well enough.</p>

  <p>"'Bad job,' he said. 'How much does Wingrave want?'</p>

  <p>"'Shares at par,' I answered. 'It comes to close on fifty-seven thousand
  six hundred dollars.'</p>

  <p>"'I'm going to find you the money,' he said.</p>

  <p>"Then I can tell you the things in my office began to swim. I'd an idea
  somehow that he was there as a friend, but nothing like this. I couldn't
  answer him.</p>

  <p>"'It's a delicate piece of business,' he went on. 'In fact, the fewer
  questions you ask the better. All I can say is there's a chap in Wall Street
  got his eye on you. Your old dad once helped him over a much worse place than
  this. Anyhow, I've a check here for sixty thousand dollars, and no
  conditions, only that you don't talk.'</p>

  <p>"'But when am I to pay it back?' I gasped.</p>

  <p>"'If my client ever needs it, and you can afford it, he will ask for it.'
  Phillson answered. 'That's all.'</p>

  <p>"And before I could say another darned word, he was gone, and the check
  was there on my desk."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth sipped his whisky and Apollinaris, and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"And they say," he murmured, "that romance does not exist in Wall Street.
  You're a lucky chap, Nesbitt."</p>

  <p>"Lucky! Do you think I don't realize it? Of course, I know the old
  governor had lots of friends on the Street, but he was never in a big way,
  and he got hit awfully hard himself before he died. I can't understand it
  anyway."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't try," Aynesworth remarked, laughing. "By the bye, your friend,
  whoever he was, must have got to know pretty quickly."</p>

  <p>Nesbitt nodded.</p>

  <p>"I thought of that," he said. "Of course, Phillsons are lawyers for
  Malcolmson, Wingrave's broker, so I daresay it came from him. Say,
  Aynesworth, you don't mind if I ask you something?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," Aynesworth answered. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Why the devil do you stop with a man like Wingrave? He doesn't seem your
  sort at all."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Wingrave interests me," he answered. "He has had a curious life, and he
  is a man with very strange ideas."</p>

  <p>Nesbitt finished his drink, and rose up.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "he's not a man I should care to be associated with. Not
  but what I daresay he was right upstairs. He's strong, too, and he must have
  a nerve. But he's a brute for all that!"</p>

  <p>Nesbitt went his way, and Aynesworth returned upstairs. Wingrave was
  alone.</p>

  <p>"Have we finished this miserable business?" Aynesworth asked.</p>

  <p>"For the present," Wingrave answered. "Mr. Malcolmson will supply you with
  a copy of the accounts. See that Hardwell is credited with a quarter share of
  the profits. Our dealings are over for the present. Be prepared to start on
  Saturday for the West. We are going to look for those bears."</p>

  <p>"But the mine?" Aynesworth exclaimed. "It belongs to you now. Aren't you
  going out to examine it?"</p>

  <p>Wingrave shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "I know nothing about mines. My visit could not teach me
  anything one way or the other. I have sent a commission of experts. I am
  tired of cities and money-making. I want a change."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth looked at him suddenly. The weariness was there
  indeed&mdash;was it his fancy, or was it something more than weariness which
  shone out of the dark, tired eyes?</p>

  <h2>I. &mdash; "MR. WINGRAVE FROM AMERICA"</h2>

  <p class="first">"Four years ago tonight," Aynesworth said, looking round the
  club smoking room thoughtfully, "we bade you farewell in this same room!"</p>

  <p>Lovell, wan and hollow-eyed, his arm in a sling, his once burly frame
  gaunt and attenuated with disease, nodded.</p>

  <p>"And I told you the story," he remarked, "of&mdash;the man who had been my
  friend."</p>

  <p>"Don't let us talk of Wingrave tonight!" Aynesworth exclaimed with sudden
  emphasis.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Lovell knocked the ashes from his pipe, and commenced leisurely
  to refill it. "Why not, indeed? I mean to go and see him as soon as I can get
  about a little better."</p>

  <p>"If your description of him," Aynesworth said, "was a faithful one, you
  will find him changed."</p>

  <p>Lovell laughed a little bitterly.</p>

  <p>"The years leave their mark," he said, "upon us all&mdash;upon all of us,
  that is, who step out into the open where the winds of life are blowing. Look
  at me! I weighed eighteen stone when I left England. I had the muscles of a
  prize fighter and nerves of steel. Today I turn the scale at ten stone and am
  afraid to be alone in the dark."</p>

  <p>"You will be yourself again in no time," Aynesworth declared
  cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"I shall be better than I am now, I hope," Lovell answered, "but I shall
  never be the man I was. I have seen&mdash;God grant that I may some day
  forget what I have seen! No wonder that my nerves have gone! I saw a Russian
  correspondent, a strong brutal-looking man, go off into hysterics; I saw
  another run amuck through the camp, shooting right and left, and, finally,
  blow his own brains out. Many a night I sobbed myself to sleep. The men who
  live through tragedies, Aynesworth, age fast. I expect that I shall find
  Wingrave changed."</p>

  <p>"I would give a good deal," Aynesworth declared, "to have known him when
  you did."</p>

  <p>Lovell nodded.</p>

  <p>"You should be able to judge of the past," he said, "by the present. Four
  years of&mdash;intimate companionship with any man should be enough!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps!" Aynesworth declared. "And yet I can assure you that I know no
  more of Wingrave today than when I was first attracted to him by your story
  and became his secretary. It is a humiliating confession, but it is the
  truth."</p>

  <p>"That is why you remain with him," Lovell remarked.</p>

  <p>"I suppose so! I have often meant to leave, but somehow, when the time
  comes, I stay on. His life seems to be made up of brutalities, small and
  large. He ruins a man with as little compunction as one could fancy him, in
  his younger days, pulling the legs from a fly. I have never seen him do a
  kindly action. And yet, all the time I find myself watching for it. A
  situation arises, and I say to myself: 'Now I am going to see something
  different.' I never do, and yet I always expect it. Am I boring you,
  Lovell?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least! Go on! Anything concerning Wingrave interests me."</p>

  <p>"It is four years ago, you know, since I went to him. My first glimpse of
  his character was the cold brutality with which he treated Lady Ruth when she
  went to see him. Then we went down to his country place in Cornwall. There
  was a small child there, whose father had been the organist of the village,
  and who had died penniless. There was no one to look after her, no one to
  save her from the charity schools and domestic service afterwards. The church
  was on Wingrave's estate, it should have been his duty to augment the
  ridiculous salary the dead man had received. Would you believe it, Wingrave
  refused to do a single thing for that child! He went down there like a vandal
  to sell the heirlooms and pictures which had belonged to his family for
  generations. He had no time, he told me coldly, for sentiment."</p>

  <p>"It sounds brutal enough," Lovell admitted. "What became of the
  child?"</p>

  <p>"One of her father's relations turned up after all and took care of her,"
  Aynesworth said. "Wingrave knew nothing about that, though. Then on the
  voyage across the Atlantic, there was a silly, pretty little woman on board
  who was piqued by Wingrave's indifference and tried to flirt with him. In a
  few days she was his slave. She was going home to her husband, and you would
  have thought that any decent fellow would have told her that she was a little
  fool, and let her go. But not Wingrave! She was landing with him at New York,
  but someone amongst the passengers, who guessed what was up, sent a
  Marconigram to her husband, and he met us at the landing stage."</p>

  <p>"Nothing came of that, then?"</p>

  <p>"No, but it wasn't Wingrave's fault. Then he began dealing with some
  shares in a mine&mdash;THE mine, you know. They were supposed to be
  worthless, and one boy, who was a little young to the game, sold him too
  many. Wingrave was bleeding these brokers for hundreds of thousands of
  dollars, and the boy came and asked to be let off by paying his whole fortune
  to escape being hammered. Wingrave refused. I believe if the boy hadn't just
  been married, he'd have blown his brains out!"</p>

  <p>Lovell laughed.</p>

  <p>"I don't envy you your job," he remarked. "Is there nothing to set down on
  the credit side of the ledger?"</p>

  <p>"Not much," Aynesworth answered. "He is a fine sportsman, and he saved my
  life in the Rockies, which makes me feel a bit uncomfortable sometimes. He
  has a sense of justice, for he heard of this mine from a man in prison, and
  he has kept accounts showing the fellow's share down to the last halfpenny.
  But I have never yet known him to speak a kindly word or do a kindly deed. He
  seems intent upon carrying out to the letter his own principles&mdash;to make
  as many people as possible suffer for his own broken life. Now he is back
  here, a millionaire, with immense power for good or for evil, I am almost
  afraid of him. I wouldn't be Lady Ruth or her husband for something."</p>

  <p>Lovell smoked thoughtfully for a time.</p>

  <p>"Wingrave was always a little odd," he remarked, "but I never thought that
  he was a bad chap."</p>

  <p>"Go and see him now!" Aynesworth said. "Tell me if you think he wears a
  mask or whether he is indeed what he seems."</p>

  <p>The hall porter entered the room and addressed Aynesworth.</p>

  <p>"Gentleman called for you, sir," he announced.</p>

  <p>"It is Wingrave," Aynesworth declared. "Come and speak to him!"</p>

  <p>They descended the stairs together. Outside, Wingrave was leaning back in
  the corner of an electric brougham, reading the paper. Aynesworth put his
  head in at the window.</p>

  <p>"You remember Lovell, Mr. Wingrave?" he said. "We were just talking when
  your message came up. I've brought him down to shake hands with you."</p>

  <p>Wingrave folded his paper down at the precise place where he had been
  reading and extended a very limp hand. His manner betrayed not the slightest
  interest or pleasure.</p>

  <p>"How are you, Lovell?" he asked. "Some time since we met!"</p>

  <p>"A good many years," Lovell answered.</p>

  <p>"Finished your campaigning?" Wingrave inquired. "Knocked you about a bit,
  haven't they?"</p>

  <p>"They very nearly finished me," Lovell admitted. "I shall pick up all
  right over here, though."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. Lovell's thoughts had flashed backwards
  through the years, back to the time when he had sat within a few feet of this
  man in the crowded court of justice and listened through the painful
  stillness of that heavy atmosphere, charged with tragedy, to the slow
  unfolding of the drama of his life. There had been passion enough then in his
  voice and blazing in his eyes, emotion enough in his twitching features and
  restless gestures to speak of the fire below. And now, pale and cold, the man
  who had gripped his fingers then and held on to them like a vise, seemed to
  find nothing except a slight boredom in this unexpected meeting.</p>

  <p>"I shall see you again, I hope," Wingrave remarked at last. "By the bye,
  if we do meet, I should be glad if you would forget our past acquaintance.
  Sir Wingrave Seton does not exist any longer. I prefer to be known only as
  Mr. Wingrave from America."</p>

  <p>Lovell nodded.</p>

  <p>"As you wish, of course," he answered. "I do not think," he added, "that
  you need fear recognition. I myself should have passed you in the
  street."</p>

  <p>Wingrave leaned back in the carriage.</p>

  <p>"Aynesworth," he said, "if you are ready, will you get in and tell the man
  to drive to Cadogan Square? Good night, Mr. Lovell!"</p>

  <p>Lovell re-entered the club with a queer little smile at his lips. The
  brougham glided up into the Strand, and turned westwards.</p>

  <p>"We are going straight to the Barringtons'?" Aynesworth asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Wingrave answered. "While I think of it, Aynesworth, I wish you to
  remember this. Both Lady Ruth and her husband seem to think it part of the
  game to try and make a cat's paw of you. I am not suggesting that they are
  likely to succeed, but I do think it possible that one of them may ask you
  questions concerning certain investments in which I am interested. I rely
  upon you to give them no information."</p>

  <p>"I know very little about your investments&mdash;outside the mine,"
  Aynesworth answered. "They couldn't very well approach a more ignorant
  person. Are you going to help Barrington to make a fortune?"</p>

  <p>Wingrave turned his head. There was a slight contraction of the forehead,
  an ominous glitter in his steel grey eyes.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "you know that I am not likely to do that."</p>

  <p>The two men did not meet again till late in the evening. Lady Ruth's rooms
  were crowded for it was the beginning of the political season, and her
  parties were always popular. Nevertheless, she found time to beckon Wingrave
  to her before they had been in the room many minutes.</p>

  <p>"I want to talk to you," she said a little abruptly. "You might have come
  this afternoon as you promised."</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth was a wonderful woman. A well-known statesman had just asked a
  friend her age.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," was the answer, "but whatever it is, she doesn't look
  it."</p>

  <p>Tonight she was almost girlish. Her complexion was delicate and perfectly
  natural, the graceful lines of her figure suggested more the immaturity of
  youth than any undue slimness. She wore a wonderful collar of pearls around
  her long, shapely neck, but very little other jewelry. The touch of her
  fingers upon Wingrave's coat sleeve was a carefully calculated thing. If he
  had thought of it, he could have felt the slight appealing pressure with
  which she led him towards one of the smaller rooms.</p>

  <p>"There are two chairs there," she said. "Come and sit down. I have
  something to say to you."</p>

  <h2>II. &mdash; THE SHADOW OF A FEAR</h2>

  <p class="first">For several minutes Lady Ruth said nothing. She was leaning
  back in the farthest corner of her chair, her head resting slightly upon her
  fingers, her eyes studying with a curious intentness the outline of
  Wingrave's pale, hard face. He himself, either unconscious of, or indifferent
  to her close scrutiny, had simply the air of a man possessed of an
  inexhaustible fund of patience.</p>

  <p>"Wingrave," she said quietly, "I think that the time has gone by when I
  was afraid of you."</p>

  <p>He turned slightly towards her, but he did not speak.</p>

  <p>"I am possessed," she continued, "at present, of a more womanly sentiment.
  I am curious."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he murmured, "you were always a little inclined that way."</p>

  <p>"I am curious about you," she continued. "You are, comparatively speaking,
  young, well-looking enough, and strong. Your hand is firmly planted upon the
  lever which moves the world. What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"That," he said, "depends upon many things."</p>

  <p>"You may be ambitious," she remarked. "If so, you conceal it admirably.
  You may be devoting your powers to the consummation of vengeance against
  those who have treated you ill. There are no signs of that, either, at
  present."</p>

  <p>"We have excellent authority," he remarked, "for the statement that a
  considerable amount of satisfaction is derivable from the exercise of that
  sentiment."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," she answered, "but the pursuit of vengeance for wrongs of the
  past is the task of a fool. Now, you are not a fool. You carry your life
  locked up within you as a strong man should. But there are always some who
  may look in through the windows. I should like to be one."</p>

  <p>"An empty cupboard," he declared. "A cupboard swept bare by time and
  necessity."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Your life," she said, "is molded towards a purpose. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"I must ask myself the question," he declared, "before I can tell you the
  answer!"</p>

  <p>"No," she said, "the necessity does not exist. Your reckless pursuit of
  wealth, your return here, the use you are making of my husband and me, are
  all means towards some end. Why not tell me?"</p>

  <p>"Your imagination," he declared, "is running away with you."</p>

  <p>"Are you our enemy?" she asked. "Is this seeming friendship of yours a
  cloak to hide some scheme of yours to make us suffer? Or&mdash;" She drew a
  little closer to him, and her eyes drooped.</p>

  <p>"Or what?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"Is there a little left," she whispered, "of the old folly?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he answered quietly. "I was very much in love with you."</p>

  <p>"It is dead," she murmured. "I believe that you hate me now!"</p>

  <p>Her voice was almost a caress. She was leaning a little towards him; her
  eyes were seeking to draw his.</p>

  <p>"Hate you! How impossible!" he said calmly. "You are still a beautiful
  woman, you know, Ruth."</p>

  <p>He turned and studied her critically. Lady Ruth raised her eyes once, but
  dropped them at once. She felt herself growing paler. A spasm of the old fear
  was upon her.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he continued, "age has not touched you. You can still pour, if you
  will, the magic drug into the wine of fools. By the bye, I must not be
  selfish. Aren't you rather neglecting your guests?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind my guests," she answered. "I have been wanting to talk to you
  alone for days. Why have you done this? Why are you here? What is it that you
  are seeking for in life?"</p>

  <p>"A little amusement only," he declared. "I cannot find it except amongst
  my own kind."</p>

  <p>"You have not the appearance of a pleasure seeker," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Mine is a passive search," he said. "I have some years to live&mdash;and
  of solitude, well, I have tasted at once the joys and the depths."</p>

  <p>"You are not in love with me any longer, are you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I am not bold enough to deny it," he answered, "but do not be afraid that
  I shall embarrass you with a declaration. To tell you the truth, I have not
  much feeling left of any sort."</p>

  <p>"You mean to keep your own counsel, then?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It is so little to keep," he murmured, "and I have parted with so
  much!"</p>

  <p>She measured the emotion of his tone, the curious yet perfectly natural
  indifference of his manner, and she shivered a little. Always she feared what
  she could not understand.</p>

  <p>"I had hoped," she said sadly, "that we might at least have been
  friends."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I have no fancy," he declared, "for the cemeteries of affection. You must
  remember that I am beginning life anew. I do not know myself yet, or you! Let
  us drift into the knowledge of one another, and perhaps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well! Perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"There may be no question of friendship!"</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth went back to her guests, and with the effortless ease of long
  training, she became once more the gracious and tactful hostess. But in her
  heart, the fear had grown a little stronger, and a specter walked by her
  side. Once during the evening, her husband looked at her questioningly, and
  she breathed a few words to him. He laughed reassuringly.</p>

  <p>"Oh! Wingrave's all right, I believe," he said, "it's only his manner that
  puts you off a bit. He's just the same with everyone! I don't think he means
  anything by it!"</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth shivered, but she said nothing. Just then Aynesworth came up,
  and with a motion of her fan she called him to her.</p>

  <p>"Please take me into the other room," she said "I want a glass of
  champagne, and on the way you can tell me all about America."</p>

  <p>"One is always making epigrams about America," he protested, smiling.
  "Won't you spare me?"</p>

  <p>"Tell me, then, how you progress with your great character study!"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he remarked quietly, "you come now to a more interesting
  subject."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Frankly, I do not progress at all."</p>

  <p>"So far as you have gone?"</p>

  <p>"If," he said, "I were to take pen and paper and write down, at this
  moment, my conclusions so far as I have been able to form any, I fancy that
  they would make evil reading. Permit me!"</p>

  <p>They stood for a few minutes before the long sideboard. A footman had
  poured champagne into their glasses, and Lady Ruth talked easily enough the
  jargon of the moment. But when they turned away, she moved slowly, and her
  voice was almost a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Tell me this," she said, "is he really as hard and cold as he seems? You
  have lived with him now for four years. You should know that, at least."</p>

  <p>"I believe that he is," Aynesworth answered. "I can tell you that much, at
  least, without breach of faith. So far as one who watches him can tell, he
  lives for his own gratification&mdash;and his indulgence in it does not, as a
  rule, make for the happiness of other people."</p>

  <p>"Then what does he want with us?" she asked almost sharply. "I ask myself
  that question until&mdash;I am terrified."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth hesitated.</p>

  <p>"It is very possible," he said, "that he is simply making use of you to
  re-enter the world. Curiously enough, he has never seemed to care for
  solitude. He makes numberless acquaintances. What pleasure he finds in it I
  do not know, but he seldom avoids people. He may be simply making use of
  you."</p>

  <p>"What do you think yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell," Aynesworth answered. "Indeed I cannot tell."</p>

  <p>She left him a little impatiently, and Aynesworth joined the outside of
  the circle of men who had gathered round Wingrave. He was answering their
  questions readily enough, if a little laconically. He was quite aware that he
  occupied in society the one unique place to which princes might not even
  aspire&mdash;there was something of divinity about his millions, something of
  awe in the tone of the men with whom he talked. Women pretended to be
  interested in him because of the romance of his suddenly acquired
  wealth&mdash;the men did not trouble to deceive themselves or anyone else. A
  break up of the group came when a certain great and much-talked-about lady
  sent across an imperative message by her cavalier for the moment. She desired
  that Mr. Wingrave should be presented to her.</p>

  <p>They passed down the room together a few moments later, the Marchioness
  wonderfully dressed in a gown of strange turquoise blue, looking up at her
  companion, and talking with somewhat unusual animation. Everyone made
  remarks, of course&mdash;exchanged significant glances and unlovely smiles.
  It was so like the Marchioness to claim, as a matter of course, the best of
  everything that was going. Lady Ruth watched them with a curious sense of
  irritation for which she could not altogether account. It was impossible that
  she should be jealous, and yet it was equally certain that she was annoyed.
  If Wingrave resisted his present fair captor, he would enjoy a notability
  equal to that which his wealth already conferred upon him. No man as yet had
  done it. Was it likely that Wingrave would wear two crowns? Lady Ruth
  beckoned Aynesworth to her.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she said, "what is Mr. Wingrave's general attitude towards my
  sex?"</p>

  <p>"Absolute indifference," he declared promptly, "unless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped short.</p>

  <p>"You must go on," she told him.</p>

  <p>"Unless he is possessed of the ability to make them suffer," he answered
  after a moment's hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Then Emily will never attract him," she declared almost triumphantly,
  "for she has no more heart that he has."</p>

  <p>"He has yet to discover it," Aynesworth remarked. "When he does, I think
  you will find that he will shrug his shoulders&mdash;and say farewell."</p>

  <p>"All the same," Lady Ruth murmured to herself, "Emily is a cat."</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth spoke to one more man that night of Wingrave&mdash;and that man
  was her husband. Their guests had departed, and Lady Ruth, in a marvelous
  white dressing gown, was lying upon the sofa in her room.</p>

  <p>"How do you get on with Wingrave?" she asked. "What do you think of
  him?"</p>

  <p>Barrington shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"What can one think of a man," he answered, "who goes about like an
  animated mummy? I have done my best; I talked to him for nearly half an hour
  at a stretch today when I took him to the club for lunch. He is the
  incarnation of indifference. He won't listen to politics; women, or tales
  about them, at any rate, seem to bore him to extinction; he drinks only as a
  matter of form, and he won't talk finance. By the bye, Ruth, I wish you could
  get him to give you a tip. I scarcely see how we are going to get through the
  season unless something turns up."</p>

  <p>"Is it as bad as that?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Worse!" her husband answered gloomily. "We've been living on our capital
  for years. Every acre of Queen's Norton is mortgaged, and I'm shot if I can
  see how we're going to pay the interest."</p>

  <p>She sighed a little wearily.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that it would be wise?" she asked. "Let me tell you
  something, Lumley. I have only known what fear was once in my life. I am
  afraid now. I am afraid of Wingrave. I have a fancy that he does not mean any
  good to us."</p>

  <p>Barrington frowned and threw his cigarette into the fire with a little
  jerk.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" he exclaimed. "The man's not quite so bad as that. We've been
  useful to him. We've done exactly what he asked. The other matter's dead and
  buried. We don't want his money, but it is perfectly easy for him to help us
  make a little."</p>

  <p>She looked up at him quietly.</p>

  <p>"I think, Lumley, that it is dangerous!" she said.</p>

  <p>"Then you're not the clever woman I take you for," he answered, turning to
  leave the room. "Just as you please. Only it will be that or the bankruptcy
  court before long!"</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth lay quite still, looking into the fire. When her maid came, she
  moved on tiptoe for it seemed to her that her mistress slept. But Lady Ruth
  was wide awake though the thoughts which were flitting through her brain had,
  perhaps, some kinship to the land of dreams.</p>

  <h2>III. &mdash; JULIET ASKS QUESTIONS</h2>

  <p class="first">"Any place," the girl exclaimed as she entered, "more unlike
  a solicitor's office, I never saw! Flowers outside and flowers on your desk,
  Mr. Pengarth! Don't you have to apologize to your clients for your
  surroundings? There's absolutely nothing, except the brass plate outside, to
  show that this isn't an old-fashioned farmhouse, stuck down in the middle of
  a village. Fuchsias in the window sill, too!"</p>

  <p>He placed a chair for her, and laid down the deed which he had been
  examining, with a little sigh of relief. It really was very hard work
  pretending to be busy.</p>

  <p>"You see, Miss Juliet," he explained with twinkling eyes, "my clients are
  all country folk, and it makes them feel more at home to find a lawyer's
  office not very different from their own parlor."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"What would the great man say?" she inquired, pointing to the rows of
  black tin boxes which lined the walls.</p>

  <p>"Sir Wingrave Seton is never likely to come here again, I am afraid," he
  answered. "If he did, I don't think he'd mind. To tell you the truth, I'm
  rather proud of my office, young lady!"</p>

  <p>She looked around.</p>

  <p>"They are nice," she said decidedly, "but unbusinesslike."</p>

  <p>"You're going to put up the pony and stay to lunch, of course?" he said.
  "I'll ring for the boy."</p>

  <p>She stopped him.</p>

  <p>"Please don't!" she exclaimed. "I have come to see you&mdash;on
  business!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Pengarth, after his first gasp of astonishment, was a different man.
  He fumbled about on the desk, and produced a pair of gold spectacles, which
  he adjusted with great nicety on the edge of his very short nose.</p>

  <p>"On business, my dear!" he repeated. "Well, well! To be sure! Is it Miss
  Harrison who has sent you?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Pengarth's visitor looked positively annoyed. She leaned across the
  table towards him so that the roses in her large hat almost brushed his
  forehead. Her wonderful brown eyes were filled with reproach.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Pengarth," she said, "do you know how old I am?"</p>

  <p>"How old, my dear? Why, let me see!" he exclaimed. "Fourteen
  and&mdash;why, God bless my soul, you must be eighteen!"</p>

  <p>"I am nineteen years old, Mr. Pengarth," the young lady announced with
  dignity. "Perhaps you will be kind enough to treat me now&mdash;er&mdash;with
  a little more respect."</p>

  <p>"Nineteen!" he repeated vaguely. "God bless my&mdash;nineteen years
  old?"</p>

  <p>"I consider myself," she repeated, "of age. I have come to see you about
  my affairs!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes!" he said. "Quite natural."</p>

  <p>"For four years," she continued, "I seem to have been supported by some
  relative of my father, who has never vouchsafed to send me a single line or
  message except through you. I have written letters which I have given to you
  to forward. There has been no reply. Have you sent on those letters, Mr.
  Pengarth?"</p>

  <p>"Why certainly, my dear, certainly!"</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me how it is that I have had no answer?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Pengarth coughed. He was not at all comfortable.</p>

  <p>"Your guardian, Miss Juliet, is somewhat eccentric," he answered, "and he
  is a very busy man."</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me, Mr. Pengarth, exactly what relation he is to me?"</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence. Mr. Pengarth found the room suddenly warm, and
  mopped his forehead with a large silk handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"I have no authority," he declared, "to answer any questions."</p>

  <p>"Then can you tell me of your own accord," she said, "why there is all
  this mystery? Why may I not know who he is, why may I not write to him? Am I
  anything to be ashamed of, that he will not trust me even with his name? I am
  tired of accepting so much and not being able to offer even my thanks in
  return. It is too much like charity! I have made up my mind that if this is
  to go on, I will go away and earn my own living! There, Mr. Pengarth!"</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" he exclaimed briskly. "What at?"</p>

  <p>"Painting!" she declared triumphantly. "I have had this in my mind for
  some time, and I have been trying to see what I can do best. I have quite
  decided, now, to be an artist."</p>

  <p>"Pictures," he declared sententiously, "don't sell!"</p>

  <p>"Mine do," she answered, smiling. "I have had a check for three guineas
  from a shop in London for a little sea piece I did in two afternoons!"</p>

  <p>He regarded her admiringly.</p>

  <p>"You are a wonderful child!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I am not a child at all," she interrupted warmly, "and you can just sit
  down and write to your silly client and tell him so."</p>

  <p>"I will certainly write to him," he affirmed. "I will do so today. You
  will not do anything rash until I have had time to get a reply?"</p>

  <p>"No!" she answered graciously. "I will wait for a week. After
  that&mdash;well, I might do anything!"</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't leave Tredowen, Miss Juliet!" he protested.</p>

  <p>"It would break my heart, of course," she declared, "but I would do it and
  trust to time to heal it up again. Tredowen seems like home to me, but it
  isn't really, you know. Some day, Sir Wingrave Seton may want to come back
  and live there himself. Are you quite certain, Mr. Pengarth, that he won't be
  angry to hear that we have been living at the house all this time?"</p>

  <p>"Certain," Mr. Pengarth declared firmly. "He left everything entirely in
  my hands. He did not wish me to let it, but he did not care about its being
  altogether uninhabited. The arrangement I was able to make with your guardian
  was a most satisfactory one."</p>

  <p>"But surely he will come back himself some time?" she asked,</p>

  <p>The lawyer shook his head sorrowfully.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, "that Sir Wingrave has no affection for the place
  whatever."</p>

  <p>"No affection for Tredowen," she repeated wonderingly. "Do you know what I
  think, Mr. Pengarth? I think that it is the most beautiful house in the
  world!"</p>

  <p>"And yet you talk of leaving it."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to go," she answered, "but I don't want to be accepting
  things all my life from someone whose name even I do not know."</p>

  <p>"Well, well," he said, "you must wait until I have written my letter. Time
  enough to talk about that later on. Now, if you won't stay to lunch, you must
  come and see Rachael and have some cake and a glass of wine."</p>

  <p>"How sweet of you," she exclaimed. "I'm frightfully hungry. Can I do
  anything to stop growing, Mr. Pengarth? I'm getting taller and taller!"</p>

  <p>She stood up. She was head and shoulders taller than the little lawyer,
  slim as a lath, and yet wonderfully graceful. She laughed down at him and
  made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"I'm a giraffe, am I not?" she declared; "and I'm still growing. Do show
  me your garden, Mr. Pengarth. I want to see your hollyhocks. Everyone is
  talking about them."</p>

  <p>They were joined in a few minutes by a prim, dignified little lady,
  ridiculously like Mr. Pengarth, whom he called sister, and she Miss Rachael.
  Juliet walked down the garden between them.</p>

  <p>"Sister," Mr. Pengarth said, "Juliet has come today to see me on business.
  In effect, she has come to remind me that she is grown up."</p>

  <p>"Grown up," Miss Rachael protested vigorously, "rubbish!"</p>

  <p>"I am nineteen years old," Juliet declared.</p>

  <p>"And what if you are," Miss Rachael replied briskly. "In my young days we
  were in the nursery at nineteen."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," Mr. Pengarth assented with relief. "You took me by storm just
  now, Miss Juliet. After all, you are only a child."</p>

  <p>"I am old enough to feel and to mean all that I said to you, Mr.
  Pengarth," she answered gravely. "And that reminds me, too&mdash;there was
  something else I meant to ask you."</p>

  <p>"Sister," Mr. Pengarth said, "have you ordered the wine and the cake?"</p>

  <p>"Bless me, no!" Miss Rachael declared. "It shall be ready in five
  minutes."</p>

  <p>She entered the house. Mr. Pengarth stooped to pick some lavender.</p>

  <p>"The only time I ever saw Sir Wingrave Seton," she said, "was on the day
  before I was told that a relation of my father had been found, who was
  willing to take charge of me. There was a younger man with him, someone very,
  very different from Sir Wingrave. Do you know who he was?"</p>

  <p>"A sort of secretary of Sir Wingrave, I believe, dear. I never met him. I
  was, unfortunately, away at the time they came."</p>

  <p>"He was very nice and kind to me," the girl continued, "just as nice as
  Sir Wingrave was horrid. I suppose it was because they came on that day, but
  I have always connected him somehow with this mysterious relation of mine.
  Mr. Aynesworth didn't help to find him, did he?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not!" the lawyer answered. "The instructions I had came first
  from Mr. Saunders, the vicar of the parish. It was he who appeared to have
  made the necessary inquiries."</p>

  <p>"Horrid old man!" she declared. "He used to make me feel that I wanted to
  cry every time that I saw him."</p>

  <p>"Miss Rachael is calling us," the lawyer declared with obvious relief.</p>

  <p>"New cake!" Juliet declared, "I can smell it! Delicious!"</p>

  <h2>IV. &mdash; LADY RUTH'S LAST CARD</h2>

  <p class="first">"There are two letters," Aynesworth announced, "which I have
  not opened. One, I think, is from the Marchioness of Westhampton, the other
  from some solicitors at Truro. They were both marked private."</p>

  <p>Wingrave was at breakfast in his flat; Aynesworth had been in an adjoining
  room sorting his correspondence. He accepted the two letters, and glanced
  them through without remark. But whereas he bestowed scarcely a second's
  consideration upon the broad sheet of white paper with the small coronet and
  the faint perfume of violets, the second letter apparently caused him some
  annoyance. He read it through for a second time with a slight frown upon his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"You must cancel my engagements for two days, Aynesworth," he said. "I
  have to go out of town."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth nodded.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing very special on," he remarked. "Do you want me to go with
  you?"</p>

  <p>"It is not necessary," Wingrave answered. "I am going," he added, after a
  moment's pause, "to Cornwall."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth was immediately silent. The one time when Wingrave had spoken
  to him as an employer, was in answer to some question of his as to what had
  eventually become of the treasures of Tredowen. He had always since
  scrupulously avoided the subject.</p>

  <p>"Be so good as to look out the trains for me," Wingrave continued. "I
  cannot go until the afternoon," he added after a momentary pause. "I have an
  engagement for luncheon. Perhaps, if you are not too busy, you will see that
  Morrison packs some things for me."</p>

  <p>He moved to the writing table, and wrote a few lines to the Marchioness,
  regretting that his absence from town would prevent his dining with her on
  the following day. Then he studied the money column in several newspapers for
  half an hour, and telephoned to his broker. At eleven o'clock, he rode for an
  hour in the quietest part of the park, avoiding, so far as possible, anyone
  he knew, and galloping whenever he could. It was the only form of exercise in
  which he was known to indulge although the knowledge of English games, which
  he sometimes displayed, was a little puzzling to some of his acquaintances.
  On his return, he made a simple but correct toilet, and at half-past one he
  met Lady Ruth at Prince's Restaurant.</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth's gown of dove color, with faint touches of blue, was effective,
  and she knew it. Nevertheless, she was a little pale, and her manner lacked
  that note of quiet languor which generally characterized it. She talked
  rather more than usual, chattering idly about the acquaintances to whom she
  was continually nodding and bowing. Her face hardened a little as the
  Marchioness, on her way through the room with a party of friends, stopped at
  their table.</p>

  <p>The two women exchanged the necessary number of inanities, then the
  Marchioness turned to Wingrave.</p>

  <p>"You won't forget that you are dining with me tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>Wingrave shook his head regretfully.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said, "but I have to go out of town. I have just written
  you."</p>

  <p>"What a bore," she remarked. "Business, of course!"</p>

  <p>She nodded and passed on. Her farewell to Lady Ruth was distinctly curt.
  Wingrave resumed his seat and his luncheon without remark.</p>

  <p>"Hateful woman," Lady Ruth murmured.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were friends," Wingrave remarked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we are," Lady Ruth assented, "the sort of friendship you men don't
  know much about. You see a good deal of her, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Wingrave raised his head and looked at Lady Ruth contemplatively.</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask me that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Curiosity!"</p>

  <p>"I do," he remarked; "you should be grateful to her."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"It may save you a similar infliction."</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth was silent for several moments.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," she said at last, "I do not choose to be relieved."</p>

  <p>Wingrave bowed, his glass in his hand. His lips were curled into the
  semblance of a smile, but he did not say a word. Lady Ruth leaned a little
  across the table so that the feathers of her hat nearly brushed his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"Wingrave," she asked, "do you know what fear is? Perhaps not! You are a
  man, you see. No one has ever called me a coward. You wouldn't, would
  you?"</p>

  <p>"No!" he said deliberately, "you are not a coward."</p>

  <p>"There is only one sort of fear which I know," she continued, "and that is
  the fear of what I do not understand. And that is why, Wingrave, I am afraid
  of you."</p>

  <p>He set down his glass, and his fingers trifled for a moment with its stem.
  His expression was inscrutable.</p>

  <p>"Surely," he said, "you are not serious!"</p>

  <p>"I am serious," she declared, "and you know that I am."</p>

  <p>"You are afraid of me," he repeated softly. "I wonder why."</p>

  <p>She looked him straight in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"Because," she said, "I did you once a very grievous wrong. Because I know
  that you have not forgiven me. Because I am very sure that all the good that
  was in you lies slain."</p>

  <p>"By whose hand?" he asked quietly. "No! You need not answer. You know. So
  do I. Yes, I can understand your fear. But I do not understand why you
  confess it to me."</p>

  <p>"Nor I," she answered. "Nor do I understand why I am here&mdash;at your
  bidding, nor why I keep you always by my side whenever you choose to take
  your place there. Are you a vain man, Wingrave? Do you wish to pose as the
  friend of a woman whom the world has thought too ambitious to waste time upon
  such follies? There is the Marchioness! She would do you more credit
  still."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," he answered. "I like to choose the path myself when I pass
  into the maze of follies!"</p>

  <p>"You have not yet explained yourself," she reminded him. "Of all people in
  world, you have chosen us for your presumptive friends. Why? You hate us
  both. You know that you do. Is it part of a scheme? Lumley is investing money
  on your advice, I am allowing myself to be seen about with you more than is
  prudent&mdash;considering all things. Do you want to rake out the ashes of
  our domestic hearth&mdash;to play the part of&mdash;melodramatic villain? You
  are ingenious enough, and powerful enough."</p>

  <p>"You put strange ideas into my head," he told her lightly. "Why should I
  not play the part that you suggest? It might be amusing, and you certainly
  deserve all the evil which I could bring upon you."</p>

  <p>She leaned a little across the table towards him. Her eyes were soft and
  bright, and they looked full into his. The color in her cheeks was natural.
  The air around him was faintly fragrant with the perfume of her clothes and
  hair.</p>

  <p>"We couldn't leave off playing at the game&mdash;and act it, could we?"
  she murmured. "We couldn't really&mdash;be friends?"</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth had played her trump card. She had touched his fingers with
  hers, her eyes shone with the promise of unutterable things. But if Wingrave
  was moved, he did not show it.</p>

  <p>"I wish," he said, "that I could accept your offer in the spirit with
  which you tender it. Unfortunately, I am a maimed person. My sensibilities
  have gone. Friendship, in the more intimate sense of the word, I may never
  hope to feel again. Enmity&mdash;well, that is more comprehensible; even
  enmity," he continued slowly, "which might prompt a woman to disguise herself
  as her own lady's maid, to seek out a tool to get rid of the man she feared.
  Pardon me, Lady Ruth, you are eating nothing."</p>

  <p>She pulled down her veil.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, I have finished," she said in a low tone.</p>

  <p>He called for the bill.</p>

  <p>"Pray, don't let my little remark distress you," he said. "I had almost
  forgotten the circumstance until something you said brought it into my mind.
  It is you yourself, you must remember, who set the example of candor."</p>

  <p>"I deserve everything you can say," she murmured, "everything you can do.
  There is nothing left, I suppose, but suffering. Will you take me out to my
  carriage? You can come back and have your coffee with the Marchioness! She
  keeps looking across at you, and it will please her to think that you got rid
  of me."</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, rising, "that I must deny myself the pleasure of
  seeking the Marchioness again today. I have a train to catch in half an hour.
  You are ready?"</p>

  <p>"Quite!"</p>

  <p>They made their way through the maze of tables towards the door, Lady Ruth
  exchanging greetings right and left with her friends, although the tall,
  grave-looking man who followed her was by far the greater object of
  interest.</p>

  <p>"Just like Ruth to keep him in her pocket," remarked her dearest friend,
  looking after them; "they say that he has millions."</p>

  <p>She sighed a little enviously.</p>

  <p>"The Barrington menage needs a little backing up," her companion remarked.
  "I should say that he had come just in time. The Marchioness has her eye upon
  him too. There may be some fun presently."</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth's dearest friend smiled.</p>

  <p>"I will back Ruth," she said drily. "Emily is beautiful, but she is too
  obvious, and too eager! Ruth's little ways are more subtle. Besides, look at
  the start she has. She isn't the sort of woman men tire of."</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth held out her hand through the window of her electric coupe.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for my luncheon," she said. "When shall we see you again?"</p>

  <p>"In a few days," he answered, standing bareheaded upon the pavement. "I
  shall call directly I return."</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth nodded and leaned back. Wingrave smiled faintly as he turned
  away. He had seen the little shudder which she had done her best to hide!</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth found her husband at home, writing letters in his study. She
  sank wearily into a chair by his side.</p>

  <p>"Been lunching out?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"At Prince's, with Wingrave."</p>

  <p>He made no remark, but he seemed far from displeased.</p>

  <p>"If I'd only had the pluck," he remarked a little disconsolately, "I might
  have made thousands by following his advice this week. It was you who put me
  off, too!"</p>

  <p>"It turned out all right?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Exactly as he said. I made five hundred! I might just as well have made
  five thousand."</p>

  <p>"Can you let me have a couple of hundred?" she asked. "The people are all
  bothering so."</p>

  <p>"You know that I can't," he answered irritably. "I had to send the lot to
  Lewis, and then it wasn't a quarter of what he is pressing for. We shall
  never get through the season, Ruth, unless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Unless what?"</p>

  <p>"Unless something turns up!"</p>

  <p>There was a short, uncomfortable silence. Lady Ruth rose to her feet and
  stood facing the fireplace with her back to him.</p>

  <p>"Lumley," she said, "let's face it!"</p>

  <p>He gave a little start.</p>

  <p>"Face what?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Ruin, the Bankruptcy Court, and all the rest of it!" she declared, a note
  of defiance creeping into her tone.</p>

  <p>Her husband's face was white with astonishment. He stared across at her
  blankly.</p>

  <p>"Are you mad, Ruth?" he exclaimed. "Do you know what you are saying?"</p>

  <p>"Quite well," she answered. "I'm a little sick of the whole show. The
  tradespeople are getting impertinent. I don't even know where to get flowers
  for dinner tonight or where to go for my Ascot gowns. It must come sooner or
  later."</p>

  <p>"You're talking like a fool," he declared harshly. "Do you know that I
  should have to give up my seat and my clubs?"</p>

  <p>"We could live quietly in the country."</p>

  <p>"Country be&mdash;hanged!" he exclaimed savagely. "What use is the country
  to you and me? I'd sooner put a bullet through my brain. Ruth, old lady," he
  added more gently, "what's gone wrong? You're generally such a well
  plucked'un! Have you&mdash;had a row with Wingrave?" he asked, looking at her
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"Then what is it?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing! I've lost my nerve, I suppose!"</p>

  <p>"You want a change! It isn't so very long to Cowes now and, thank heavens,
  that'll cost us nothing. We're going on Wingrave's yacht, aren't we?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! We did accept."</p>

  <p>Barrington fidgeted for a moment with a paper knife.</p>

  <p>"Ruth," he asked, "what's wrong between you and Wingrave?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she answered; "I'm afraid of him, that's all!"</p>

  <p>"Afraid of him! Afraid of Wingrave!" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"Yes! I do not think that he has forgotten. I think that he means to make
  us suffer."</p>

  <p>Barrington was almost dignified.</p>

  <p>"I never heard such nonsense in my life, Ruth!" he exclaimed. "I have
  watched Wingrave closely, and I have seen no trace of anything of the sort.
  Nonsense! It is worse than nonsense! You must be getting hysterical. You must
  get all this rubbish out of your head. To tell you the truth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I was thinking that you might ask Wingrave to help us a bit. I don't
  believe he'd hesitate for a moment."</p>

  <p>Ruth looked her husband in the face. There was a curious expression in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that it would be wise of me to ask him?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he answered. "You can take care of yourself. I can trust
  you."</p>

  <p>"I told you that I was afraid of Wingrave," she reminded him. "I can take
  care of myself as a rule&mdash;and I do&mdash;as you know. I have elected to
  be one of the unfashionables in that respect. But to ask Wingrave for money
  is more than I dare do."</p>

  <p>"Then I shall ask him myself," Barrington declared.</p>

  <p>She picked up her gloves and turned to leave the room.</p>

  <p>"I should prefer even that," she said.</p>

  <h2>V. &mdash; GUARDIAN AND WARD</h2>

  <p class="first">"Up to the present, then," Wingrave remarked, "the child has
  no idea as to who has been responsible for the charge of her?"</p>

  <p>"No idea at all, Sir Wingrave," the lawyer declared. "Your wishes have
  been strictly carried out, most strictly. She imagines that it is some
  unknown connection of her father. But, as I explained to you in my letter,
  she has recently exhibited a good deal of curiosity in the matter. She
  is&mdash;er&mdash;a young lady of considerable force of character for her
  years, and her present attitude&mdash;as I explained in my letter&mdash;is a
  trifle difficult."</p>

  <p>Wingrave was sitting in the lawyer's own chair. Mr. Pengarth, who was a
  trifle nervous, preferred to stand.</p>

  <p>"She shows, I think, a certain amount of ingratitude in forcing this
  journey and explanation upon me," Wingrave declared coldly. "It should have
  been sufficient for her that her benefactor preferred to remain
  anonymous."</p>

  <p>"I regret, Sir Wingrave, that I must disagree with you," Mr. Pengarth
  answered boldly. "Miss Juliet, Miss Lundy I should say, is a young lady of
  character&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;some originality of disposition. She is a
  great favorite with everyone around here."</p>

  <p>Wingrave remained silent. He had the air of one not troubling to reply to
  what he considered folly. Through the wide open window floated in the various
  sounds of the little country town, the rumbling of heavy carts passing along
  the cobbled streets, the shrill greetings of neighbors and acquaintances
  meeting upon the sidewalk. And then the tinkling bell of a rubber-tired cart
  pulling up outside, and a clear girlish voice speaking to some one of the
  passers-by.</p>

  <p>Wingrave betrayed as much surprise as it was possible for him to show when
  at last she stood with outstretched hand before him. He had only an imperfect
  recollection of an ill-clad, untidy-looking child, with pale tear-stained
  cheeks, and dark unhappy eyes. The march of the years had been a thing whose
  effects he had altogether underestimated. The girl who stood now facing him
  was slight, and there was something of the child left in her bright eager
  face, but she carried herself with all the graceful assurance of an older
  woman. Her soft, dark eyes were lit with pleasure and excitement, her
  delicately traced eyebrows and delightful smile were somehow suggestive of
  her foreign descent. Her clothes were country-made, but perfect as regarded
  fit and trimness, her beflowered hat was worn with a touch of coquettish
  grace, a trifle un-English, but very delightful. She had not an atom of
  shyness or embarrassment. Only there was a great surprise in her face as she
  held out her hands to Wingrave.</p>

  <p>"I know who you are," she exclaimed. "You are Sir Wingrave Seton. To think
  that I never guessed."</p>

  <p>"You remember seeing me, then?" he remarked, and his tone sounded all the
  colder after the full richness of her young voice.</p>

  <p>"I just remember it&mdash;only just," she answered. "You see you did not
  take much notice of me that time, did you? But I have lived amongst your
  ancestors too long to make any mistake. Why have you stayed away from
  Tredowen so long?"</p>

  <p>"I have been abroad," Wingrave answered. "I am not fond of England."</p>

  <p>"You had trouble here, I know," she said frankly. "But that is all past
  and over. I think that you must forget how beautiful your home is or you
  would never bear to live away from it. Now, please, may I ask you a
  question?"</p>

  <p>"Any that you think necessary," Wingrave answered. "Spare me as much as
  possible; I am not fond of them."</p>

  <p>"Shall I leave you two together for a little time?" Mr. Pengarth
  suggested, gathering up some papers.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," Wingrave said shortly. "There is not the slightest
  necessity for it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pengarth resumed his seat.</p>

  <p>"Just as you please," he answered. "But you must sit down, Juliet. There,
  you shall have my clients' chair."</p>

  <p>The girl accepted it with a little laugh. There was no shadow of
  embarrassment about her manner, notwithstanding the cold stiffness of
  Wingrave's deportment. He sat where the sunlight fell across his chair, and
  the lines in his pale face seemed deeper than usual, the grey hairs more
  plentiful, the weariness in his eyes more apparent. Yet she was not in the
  least afraid of him.</p>

  <p>"First of all, then, Sir Wingrave, may I ask you why you have been so
  extraordinarily kind to me?"</p>

  <p>"There is nothing extraordinary about it at all," he answered. "Your
  father died and left you friendless in a parish of which I am Lord of the
  Manor. He received a starvation pittance for his labors, which it was my duty
  to augment, a duty which, with many others, I neglected. I simply gave orders
  that you should be looked after."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Looked after! Why, I have lived at Tredowen. I have had a governess, a
  pony to drive. Heaven knows how many luxuries!"</p>

  <p>"That," he interrupted hastily, "is nothing. The house is better occupied.
  What I have done for you is less in proportion than the sixpence you may
  sometimes have given to a beggar for I am a rich, a ridiculously rich man,
  with no possible chance of spending one-quarter of my income. You had a
  distinct and obvious claim upon me, and, at no cost or inconvenience to
  myself, I have endeavored, through others, to recognize it."</p>

  <p>"I will accept your view of the situation," the girl said, still smiling,
  but with a faint note of disappointment in her tone. "I do not wish to force
  upon you expressions of gratitude which you would only find wearisome. But I
  must thank you! It is in my heart, and I must speak of it. There, it is over,
  you see! I shall say no more."</p>

  <p>"You are a sensible young lady," Wingrave said, making a motion as though
  to rise. "I have only one request to make to you, and that is that you keep
  to yourself the knowledge which Mr. Pengarth informs me that you insisted
  upon acquiring. You are nearly enough of age now, and I will make you your
  own mistress. That is all, I think."</p>

  <p>The smile died away from her lips. Her tone became very earnest.</p>

  <p>"Sir Wingrave," she said, "for all that you have done for me, I am, as you
  know grateful. I would try to tell you how grateful, only I know that it
  would weary you. So we will speak only of the future. I cannot continue to
  accept&mdash;even such magnificent alms as yours."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, child?" he asked, frowning across at her.</p>

  <p>"I mean," she said, "that now I am old enough to work, I cannot accept
  everything from one upon whom I have no claim. If you will help me a little
  still, I shall be more than grateful. But it must be in my own way."</p>

  <p>"You talk about work," he said. "What can you do?"</p>

  <p>"I can paint," she answered, "fairly well. I should like to go to London
  and have a few lessons. If I cannot make a living at that, I shall try
  something else."</p>

  <p>"You disappoint me," Wingrave said. "There is no place for you in London.
  There are thousands starving there already because they can paint a little,
  or sing a little, or fancy they can. Do you find it dull down here?"</p>

  <p>"Dull!" she exclaimed wonderingly. "I think that there can be no place on
  earth so beautiful as Tredowen."</p>

  <p>"You are happy here?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly!"</p>

  <p>"Then, for heaven's sake, forget all this folly," Wingrave said hardly.
  "London is no place for children. Miss Harrison can take you up for a month
  when you choose. You can go abroad if you want to. But for the
  rest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She rose suddenly, and sweeping across the office with one graceful
  movement, she leaned over Wingrave's chair. Her hands rested upon his
  shoulders, her eyes, soft with gathering tears, pleaded with his. Wingrave
  sat with all the outward immobility of a Sphinx.</p>

  <p>"Dear Sir Wingrave," she said, "you have been so generous, so kind, and I
  may not even speak of my gratitude. Don't please think me unreasonable or
  ungracious. I can't tell you how I feel, but I must, I must, I must go away.
  I could not live here any longer now that I know. Fancy for a moment that I
  am your sister, or your daughter! Don't you believe, really, that she would
  feel the same? And I think you would wish her to. Don't be angry with me,
  please."</p>

  <p>Wingrave's face never changed; but his fingers gripped the arms of his
  chair so that a signet ring he wore cut deep into his flesh. When he spoke,
  his tone sounded almost harsh. The girl turned away to dash the tears from
  her eyes.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of this&mdash;folly, Pengarth?"</p>

  <p>The lawyer looked his best client squarely in the face. "I do not call it
  folly, Sir Wingrave. I think that Miss Lundy is right."</p>

  <p>There was a pause. Her eyes were still pleading with him.</p>

  <p>"Against the two of you," Wingrave remarked, "I am, of course, powerless.
  After all, it is no concern of mine. I shall leave you, Pengarth, to make
  such arrangements as Miss Lundy desires!"</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet. Juliet now was pale. She dashed the tears from her
  eyes and looked at him in amazement mingled with something which was almost
  like despair.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean," she exclaimed, "you are going away without coming to
  Tredowen?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he asked. "I never had any intention of going there!"</p>

  <p>"You are very angry with me," she cried in despair. "I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her lip quivered. Wingrave interposed.</p>

  <p>"I shall be happy to go and have a look at the place," he said carelessly,
  "if you will drive me back. I fancy I have almost forgotten what it is
  like."</p>

  <p>She looked at him as at one who had spoken irreverently. Her eyes were
  full of wonder.</p>

  <p>"I think that you must have indeed forgotten," she said, "how very
  beautiful it is. It is your home too! There is no one else," she added
  softly, "who can live there, amongst all those wonderful things, and call it
  really&mdash;home!"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, "you will find that I have outlived all sentiment;
  but I will certainly come to Tredowen with you!"</p><br>

  <h2>VI. &mdash; GHOSTS OF DEAD THINGS</h2>

  <p class="first">"It was here," she said, as they passed through the walled
  garden seawards, "that I saw you first&mdash;you and the other gentleman who
  was so kind to me."</p>

  <p>Wingrave nodded.</p>

  <p>"I believe that I remember it," he said; "you were a mournful-looking
  object in a very soiled pinafore and most untidy hair."</p>

  <p>"I had been out on the cliffs," she reminded him, "where I am taking you
  now. If you are going to make unkind remarks about my hair, I think that I
  had better fetch a hat."</p>

  <p>"Pray don't leave me," he answered. "I should certainly lose my way. Your
  hair in those days was, I fancy, a little more&mdash;unkempt!"</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"It used to be cut short," she said. "Hideous! There! Isn't that
  glorious?"</p>

  <p>She had opened the postern gate in the wall, and through the narrow
  opening was framed a wonderful picture of the Cornish sea, rolling into the
  rock-studded bay. Its soft thunder was in their ears; salt and fragrant, the
  west wind swept into their faces. She closed the gate behind her, and stepped
  blithely forward.</p>

  <p>"Come!" she cried. "We will climb the cliffs where we left you alone once
  before."</p>

  <p>Side by side they stood looking over the ocean. Her head was thrown back,
  her lips a little parted. He watched her curiously.</p>

  <p>"You must have sea blood in your veins," he remarked. "You listen as
  though you heard music all the time."</p>

  <p>"And what about you?" she asked him, smiling. "You are the grandson of
  Admiral Sir Wingrave Seton who commanded a frigate at Trafalgar, and an
  ancestor of yours fought in the Armada."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said quietly, "that there is a hiatus in my life
  somewhere. There are no voices which call to me any more, and my family
  records are so much dead parchment."</p>

  <p>Trouble passed into her glowing face and clouded her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she said, "I do not like to hear you talk so. Do you know that when
  you do, you make me afraid that something I have always hoped for will never
  come to pass?"</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I have always hoped," she said, "that some day you would come once more
  to Tredowen. I suppose I am rather a fanciful person. This is a country of
  superstitions and fancies, you know; but sometimes when I have been alone in
  the picture gallery with all that long line of dark faces looking down upon
  me from the walls, I have felt like an interloper. Always they seem to be
  waiting! Tonight, after dinner, I will take you there. I will try and show
  you what I mean."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I shall never come back," he said, "and there are no more of my
  name."</p>

  <p>She hesitated. When at last she spoke, the color was coming and going in
  her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Sir Wingrave," she said, "I am only an ignorant girl, and I have no right
  to talk to you like this. Please be angry with me if you want to. I deserve
  it. I know all about&mdash;that ten years! Couldn't you forget it, and come
  back? None of the country people round here, your own people, believe
  anything evil about you. You were struck, and you struck back again. A man
  would do that. You could be as lonely as you liked here, or you could have
  friends if you wished for them. But this is the place where you ought to
  live. You would be happier here, I believe, than in exile. The love of it all
  would come back, you would never be lonely. It is the same sea which sang to
  you when you were a child, and to your fathers before you. It would bring you
  forgetfulness when you wanted it, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Wingrave interrupted her. His tone was cold, but not unkind.</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady," he said, "it is very good of you to be so
  sympathetic, but I am afraid I am not at all the sort of person you imagine
  me to be. What I was before those ten years&mdash;well, I have forgotten.
  What I am now, I unfortunately know. I am a soured, malevolent being whose
  only pleasure lies in the dealing out to others some portion of the
  unhappiness which was dealt out to me."</p>

  <p>"I do not believe it," she declared briskly.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, it is true," he declared coolly. "Listen! More or less you
  interest me. I will tell you something which I have never yet told to a
  single human being. I need not go into particulars. You will probably believe
  a broad statement. My ten years' imprisonment was more or less an
  injustice!"</p>

  <p>"Sir Wingrave!"</p>

  <p>He checked her. There was not a tremor in his tone. The gesture with which
  he had repelled her was stiff and emotionless.</p>

  <p>"I went into prison one man, I came out another. While I live, I shall
  never be able to think kindly again of a single one of my fellow creatures.
  It was not my fault. So far as our affections are concerned, we are machines,
  all of us. Well, my mainspring has broken."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it," she declared.</p>

  <p>"It is, nevertheless, true," he affirmed calmly. "I am living in exile
  because I have no friends, because friends have become an impossibility to
  me. I shall not tell you any more of my life because you are young and you
  would not believe me if I did. Some day," he added grimly, "you will probably
  hear for yourself."</p>

  <p>"I shall never believe anything," she declared, "which I do not choose to
  believe. I shall never believe, for instance, that you are quite what you
  think yourself."</p>

  <p>"We will talk of other things," he said. "Five years ago, you showed
  Aynesworth where the seagulls built."</p>

  <p>"And now I will show you," she exclaimed, "if you are sure that your head
  is steady enough. Come along!"...</p>

  <p>It was after dinner that she took him into the picture gallery. Miss
  Harrison, very much disturbed by the presence of the master of Tredowen, and
  still more so by the hint which she had already received as to coming
  changes, followed them at a little distance.</p>

  <p>"I am so sorry," Juliet said, "that we have no cigars or cigarettes."</p>

  <p>"I seldom smoke," Wingrave answered.</p>

  <p>"If only we had had the slightest idea of your coming," Miss Harrison said
  for the tenth time, "we would have made more adequate preparations. The wine
  cellar, at least, could have been opened. I allowed Mr. and Mrs. Tresfarwin
  to go for their holiday only yesterday, and the cellars, of course, are never
  touched."</p>

  <p>"Your claret was excellent," Wingrave assured her.</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure," Miss Harrison said, "that claret from the local grocer
  is not what you are accustomed to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear madam," Wingrave protested, "I seldom touch wine. Show me which
  picture it is, Juliet, that you&mdash;ah!"</p>

  <p>She had led him to the end of the gallery and stopped before what seemed
  to be a plain oak cupboard surrounded by a massive frame. She looked at him
  half fearfully.</p>

  <p>"You want to see that picture?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"If I might."</p>

  <p>He drew a bunch of keys from his pocket and calmly selected one. It was a
  little rusty, but the cupboard turned at once on its hinges. A woman's face
  smiled down upon them, dark and splendid, from the glowing touch of a great
  painter. Juliet studied it eagerly, and then stole a sidelong glance at the
  man by her side. He was surveying it critically and without any apparent
  emotion.</p>

  <p>"Herkomer's, I think," he remarked. "Quite one of his best."</p>

  <p>"It is your mother?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'm not great at genealogy," he said, "but I can go as far back as that.
  She was by way of being a great lady, the daughter of the Duke of
  Warminster."</p>

  <p>"You were an only son," she said softly. "She must have been very fond of
  you."</p>

  <p>"Customary thing, I suppose," he remarked. "Lucky for her, under the
  circumstances, that she died young."</p>

  <p>He closed the oaken door in front of the picture, and locked it.</p>

  <p>"I should like to see the armory," he said; "but I really forget&mdash;let
  me see, it is at the end of the long gallery, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>She led him there without a word. She was getting a little afraid of him.
  They inspected the library and wandered back into the picture gallery. It was
  she, now, who was silent. She had shown him all her favorite treasures
  without being able to evoke a single spark of enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"Once," she remarked, "we all had a terrible fright. We were told that
  everything was going to be sold."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I did think of it," he admitted; "but there seemed to be no hurry. All
  these things are growing into money year by year. Some day I shall send
  everything to Christie's."</p>

  <p>She looked at him in horror.</p>

  <p>"You cannot&mdash;oh, you cannot mean it?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Why not? They are no use to me."</p>

  <p>"No use?" she faltered.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit. I don't suppose I shall see them again for many years. And the
  money&mdash;well, one can use that."</p>

  <p>"But I thought&mdash;that you were rich?" she faltered.</p>

  <p>"So I am," he answered, "and yet I go on making more and more, and I shall
  go on. Money is the whip with which its possessor can scourge humanity. It is
  with money that I deal out my&mdash;forgive me, I forgot that I was talking
  aloud, and to a child," he wound up suddenly.</p>

  <p>She looked at him, dry-eyed, but with a strained look of sorrow strangely
  altering her girlish face.</p>

  <p>"You must be very unhappy," she said.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he assured her. "I am one of those fortunate persons who
  have outlived happiness and unhappiness. I have nothing to do but
  live&mdash;and pay off a few little debts."</p>

  <p>He rose directly afterwards, and she walked with him out to the gardens
  whence a short cut led to the village.</p>

  <p>"I have not tried again to make you change your mind," he said as they
  stood for a moment on the terrace. "If my wishes have any weight with you, I
  trust that you will do nothing without consulting Mr. Pengarth."</p>

  <p>"And you&mdash;" she faltered, "are you&mdash;never in London? Sha'n't I
  see you again any time?"</p>

  <p>"If you care to, by all means," he answered. "Tell Mr. Pengarth to let me
  have your address. Goodbye! Thank you for taking care of my treasures so
  well."</p>

  <p>She held his cold hand in hers and suddenly raised it to her lips. Then
  she turned away and hurried indoors.</p>

  <p>Wingrave stood still for a moment and gazed at his hand through the
  darkness as though the ghosts of dead things had flitted out from the dark
  laurel shrubs. Then he laughed quietly to himself.</p>

  <h2>VII. &mdash; SPREADING THE NETS</h2>

  <p class="first">"By the bye," the Marchioness asked him, "have you a
  Christian name?"</p>

  <p>"Sorry," Wingrave answered, "if I ever had, I've forgotten it."</p>

  <p>"Then I must call you Wingrave," she remarked. "I hate calling anyone I
  know decently well Mr. anything."</p>

  <p>"Charmed," Wingrave answered; "it isn't a bad name."</p>

  <p>"It isn't," she admitted. "By the bye," she continued, looking at him
  critically, "you are rather a surprising person, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Glad you've found it out," Wingrave answered. "I always thought so."</p>

  <p>"One associates all sorts of terrible things with
  millionaires&mdash;especially African and American ones," she remarked. "Now
  you could pass anywhere for the ordinary sort of decent person."</p>

  <p>Wingrave nodded.</p>

  <p>"I was told the other day," he remarked reflectively, "that if I would
  only cultivate two things, I might almost pass as a member of the English
  aristocracy."</p>

  <p>"What were they?" she asked rashly.</p>

  <p>"Ignorance and impertinence," he answered.</p>

  <p>The Marchioness was silent for a moment. There was a little more color
  than usual in her beautiful cheeks and a dangerous glitter in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You can go home, Mr. Wingrave," she said.</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet imperturbably. The Marchioness stretched out a long
  white hand and gently forced him back again.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't talk like that to me," she said quietly. "I am
  sensitive."</p>

  <p>He bowed.</p>

  <p>"A privilege, I believe, of your order," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Of course, if you want to quarrel&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"I don't," he assured her.</p>

  <p>"Then be sensible! I want to talk to you."</p>

  <p>"Sensible, alone with you!" he murmured. "I should establish a new
  record."</p>

  <p>"You certainly aren't in the least like a millionaire," she declared,
  smiling at him, "you are more like a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Please go on," he begged.</p>

  <p>"I daren't," she answered, shaking her head.</p>

  <p>"Then you aren't in the least like a marchioness," he declared. "At least,
  not like our American ideas of one."</p>

  <p>She laughed outright.</p>

  <p>"Bring your chair quite close to mine," she ordered, "I really want to
  talk to you."</p>

  <p>He obeyed, and affected to be absorbed in the contemplation of the rings
  on the hand which a great artist had called the most beautiful in England.
  She withdrew it a little peevishly, after a moment's pause.</p>

  <p>"I want to talk about the Barringtons," she said. "Do you know that they
  are practically ruined?"</p>

  <p>"I heard that Barrington had been gambling on the Stock Exchange the last
  few days," he answered.</p>

  <p>"He has lost a great deal of money," she answered, "and they were almost
  on their last legs before. Are you going to set them straight again?"</p>

  <p>"No idea," he answered. "I haven't been asked, for one thing."</p>

  <p>"Ruth will ask you, of course," the Marchioness said impatiently. "I
  expect that she is waiting at your flat by now. I want to know whether you
  are going to do it."</p>

  <p>The hand was again very close to his. Again Wingrave contemplated the
  rings.</p>

  <p>"I forgot that you were her friend, and are naturally anxious," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"I am not her friend," the Marchioness answered, "and&mdash;I do not wish
  you to help them."</p>

  <p>Wingrave was silent. The hand was insistent, and he held it for a moment
  lightly, and then let it go.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know," he said doubtfully. "The Barringtons have been very
  hospitable to me."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" the Marchioness answered. "You have done quite enough for them
  already. Of course, you are a man&mdash;and you must choose. I am sure that
  you understand me."</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I must think this out," he said. "The Barringtons have a sort of claim on
  me. I will let you know which way I decide."</p>

  <p>She stood close to him, and her hand fell upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You are not going!" she exclaimed. "I have told them that I am at home to
  no one, and I thought that you would stay and entertain me. Sit down again,
  Wingrave!"</p>

  <p>"Sorry," he answered, "I have a lot to do this afternoon. I came directly
  I had your note; but I have had to keep some other people waiting."</p>

  <p>"You are going to see Lady Ruth!"</p>

  <p>"Not that I know of," he declared. "I have heard nothing from her. By the
  bye, I lost some money to you at bridge the other evening. How much was it?
  Do you remember?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him for a second, and turned away.</p>

  <p>"Do you really want to know?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"If you please. Put the amount down on a piece of paper, and then I
  sha'n't forget it."</p>

  <p>She crossed the room to her desk, and returned with a folded envelope. He
  stuffed it into his waistcoat pocket.</p>

  <p>"I shall be at the opera tonight," she said. "Will you come there and tell
  me what&mdash;which you decide?"</p>

  <p>"With pleasure," he answered, "if I can get away from a stupid dinner in
  time."</p>

  <p>She let him go reluctantly. Afterwards she passed into her own room, and
  stood looking at herself in the pier glass. Artists and the society papers
  called her the most beautiful woman in England; fashion had placed her upon
  such a pinnacle that men counted it a distinction to be seen speaking to her.
  She dealt out her smiles and favors like Royalty itself; she had never once
  known a rebuff. This afternoon she felt that she had received one. Had she
  been too cold or too forward? Perhaps she had underestimated the man himself.
  She rang for her maid.</p>

  <p>"Celeste," she said, "I shall wear my new Paquin gown tonight at the
  opera, and my pearls."</p>

  <p>"Very good, your ladyship."</p>

  <p>"And I am going to lie down for an hour or two now. Don't let me be
  disturbed. I want to look my best tonight. You understand?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, your ladyship."</p>

  <p>The Marchioness rested, but she did not sleep. She was thinking of
  Wingrave!</p>

  <p>It was not Lady Ruth, but her husband, who was waiting to see Wingrave on
  his return. Aynesworth was talking to him, but at once withdrew. Wingrave
  nodded with slightly upraised eyebrows. He never shook hands with
  Barrington.</p>

  <p>"You wanted to see me?" he inquired, carelessly turning over a little pile
  of letters.</p>

  <p>Barrington was ill at ease. He hated himself and he hated his errand.</p>

  <p>"Yes, for a moment or two&mdash;if you're not busy," he said. "May I
  smoke? I'm nervous this morning."</p>

  <p>"Help yourself," Wingrave said shortly. "Cigarettes and cigars on the
  sideboard. Touch the bell if you'll take anything to drink."</p>

  <p>"Thanks&mdash;Aynesworth gave me a brandy and soda. Capital fellow,
  Aynesworth!"</p>

  <p>"Have another," Wingrave said shortly.</p>

  <p>He crossed the room to the sideboard. Wingrave glanced up from his
  letters, and smiled coldly as he saw the shaking fingers.</p>

  <p>"I don't often indulge like this," Barrington said, turning away from the
  sideboard with a tumbler already empty in his hands. "The fact is, I've had
  rather a rude knock, and Ruth thought I'd better come and see you."</p>

  <p>Wingrave remained a study of impassivity. His guest's whole demeanor, his
  uneasy words and nervous glances were an unspoken appeal to be helped out in
  what he had come to say. And Wingrave knew very well what it was.
  Nevertheless, he remained silent&mdash;politely questioning. Barrington sat
  down a little heavily. He was not so carefully dressed as usual; he looked
  older, his appearance lacked altogether that air of buoyant prosperity which
  was wont to inspire his friends and creditors with confidence.</p>

  <p>"I've been a fool, Wingrave," he said. "You showed me how to make a little
  money a few weeks ago, and it seemed so easy that I couldn't resist having a
  try by myself, only on rather a larger scale. I lost! Then I went in again to
  pull myself round, and I lost again. I lost&mdash;more than I can easily
  raise before settlement."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," Wingrave said politely. "It is very unwise to meddle in
  things you know so little about."</p>

  <p>For a moment the worm turned. Barrington rose to his feet, and with a deep
  flush upon his cheeks moved towards the door. But his spark of genuine
  feeling died out almost as soon as it had been kindled. Outside that door was
  ruin; within, as he very well knew, lay his only chance of salvation. He set
  down his hat, and turned round.</p>

  <p>"Wingrave," he said, "will you lend me some money?"</p>

  <p>Wingrave looked at him with upraised eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"I," he remarked, "lend you money? Why should I?"</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows," Barrington answered. "It is you who have chosen to seek us
  out. You have forced upon us something which has at least the semblance of
  friendship. There is no one else whom I could ask. It isn't only this damned
  Stock Exchange transaction. Everything has gone wrong with me for years. If I
  could have kept going till next July, I should have been all right. I have
  made a little success in the House, and I am promised a place in the next
  government. I know it seems queer that I should be asking you, but it is
  that&mdash;or ruin. Now you know how things are with me."</p>

  <p>"You are making," Wingrave said quietly, "a mistake. I have not pretended
  or given the slightest evidence of any friendship for yourself."</p>

  <p>Barrington looked at him with slowly mounting color.</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Wingrave interrupted. "I do not know what I might or might
  not do for Lady Ruth. I have not considered the subject. It has not, in fact,
  been presented to me."</p>

  <p>"It is the same thing," Barrington declared hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me&mdash;it is not," Wingrave answered.</p>

  <p>"What I ask you to do," Barrington said, "I ask on behalf of my wife."</p>

  <p>"As an ambassador," Wingrave said coldly, "you are not acceptable to me.
  It is a matter which I could only discuss with Lady Ruth herself. If Lady
  Ruth has anything to say to me, I will hear it."</p>

  <p>Barrington stood quite still for several moments. The veins on his
  forehead stood out like tightly drawn cords, his breath came with difficulty.
  The light in his eyes, as he looked at Wingrave, was almost murderous.</p>

  <p>"If Lady Ruth desires to see me," Wingrave remarked slowly, "I shall be
  here at nine o'clock this evening. Tomorrow my movements are uncertain. You
  will excuse me if I hurry you away now. I have an engagement which is already
  overdue."</p>

  <p>Barrington took up his hat and left the room without a word. Wingrave
  remained in his chair. His eyes followed the departing figure of his visitor.
  When he was absolutely sure that he was alone, he covered his face with one
  hand. His engagement seemed to have been with his thoughts for he did not
  stir for nearly an hour later. Then he rang the bell for Aynesworth.</p>
  <hr>

  <p><a name="ch2-08"
     id="ch2-08"><!--Chapter Anchor--></a></p>

  <h2>VIII. &mdash; IN THE TOILS</h2>

  <p class="first">Wingrave did not speak for several moments after Aynesworth
  had entered the room. He had an engagement book before him and seemed to be
  deep in its contents. When at last he looked up, his forehead was furrowed
  with thought, and he had the weary air of a man who has been indulging in
  unprofitable memories.</p>

  <p>"Aynesworth," he said, "be so good as to ring up Walters and excuse me
  from dining with him tonight."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth nodded.</p>

  <p>"Any particular form of excuse?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No! Say that I have an unavoidable engagement. I will see him tomorrow
  morning."</p>

  <p>"Anything else?" Aynesworth asked, preparing to leave the room.</p>

  <p>"No! You might see that I have no visitors this evening. Lady Ruth is
  coming here at nine o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Lady Ruth is coming here," Aynesworth repeated in a colorless tone.
  "Alone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth shrugged his shoulders, but made no remark. He turned towards
  the door, but Wingrave called him back.</p>

  <p>"Your expression, Aynesworth," he said, "interests me. Am I or the lady in
  question responsible for it?"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry for Lady Ruth," Aynesworth said. "I think that I am sorry,
  too, for her husband."</p>

  <p>"Why? She is coming of her own free will."</p>

  <p>"There are different methods of compulsion," Aynesworth answered.</p>

  <p>Wingrave regarded him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"That," he said, "is true. But I still do not understand why you are sorry
  for her."</p>

  <p>"Because," Aynesworth said, "I know the history of a certain event, and I
  know you. It is, I suppose, for this end that you made use of them."</p>

  <p>Wingrave nodded.</p>

  <p>"Quite right," he declared. "I think that the time is not far off when
  that dear lady and I can cry quits. This time, too, I see nothing to impair
  my satisfaction at the probable finale. In various other cases, as you might
  remember, I have not been entirely successful."</p>

  <p>"It depends," Aynesworth remarked drily, "upon what you term success."</p>

  <p>Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said coldly, "that you are aware of what my feelings and
  desired course of action have been with regard to those of my fellow
  creatures with whom I have happened to come into contact. It seems to me that
  I have been a trifle unfortunate in several instances."</p>

  <p>"As for instance?" Aynesworth asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, to take a few cases only," Wingrave continued, "there was the child
  down at Tredowen whom you were so anxious for me to befriend. Of course, I
  declined to do anything of the sort, and she ought, by rights, to have gone
  to some charitable institution, founded and supported by fools, and
  eventually become, perhaps, a domestic servant. Instead of which, some
  relation of her father turns up and provides for her lavishly. You must admit
  that that was unfortunate."</p>

  <p>"It depends upon the point of view," Aynesworth remarked drily.
  "Personally, I considered it a most fortunate occurrence."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," Wingrave agreed. "But then you are a sentimentalist. You like
  to see people happy, and you would even help to make them so if you could
  without any personal inconvenience. I am at the other pole. If I could
  collect humanity into one sentient force, I would set my heel upon it without
  hesitation. I try to do what I can with the atoms, but I have not the best of
  fortune. There was Mrs. Travers, now! There I should have been successful
  beyond a doubt if some busybody hadn't sent that cable to her husband. I
  wonder if you were idiot enough to do that, Aynesworth?"</p>

  <p>"If I had thought of the Marconigram," Aynesworth said, "I am sure I
  should have done it. But as a matter of fact, I did not."</p>

  <p>"Just as well, so far as our relations are concerned," Wingrave said
  coldly. "I did manage to make poor men of a few brokers in New York, but my
  best coup went wrong. That boy would have blown his brains out, I believe, if
  some meddling idiot hadn't found him all that money at the last moment. I
  have had a few smaller successes, of course, and there is this affair of Lady
  Ruth and her estimable husband. You know that he came to borrow money of me,
  I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I guessed it," Aynesworth answered. "You should be modern in your revenge
  and lend it to him."</p>

  <p>Wingrave smiled coldly.</p>

  <p>"I fancy," he said, "that Lumley Barrington will find my revenge modern
  enough. I may lend the money they need&mdash;but it will be to Lady Ruth! I
  told her husband so a few minutes ago. I told him to send his wife to me. He
  has gone to tell her now!"</p>

  <p>"I wonder," Aynesworth remarked, "that he did not thrash you&mdash;or try
  to."</p>

  <p>Again Wingrave's lips parted.</p>

  <p>"Moral deterioration has set in already," he remarked. "When he pays his
  bills with my money, he will lose the little he has left of his
  self-respect."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth turned abruptly away. He was strongly tempted to say things
  which would have ended his connection with Wingrave, and as yet he was not
  ready to leave. For the sake of a digression, he took up a check book from
  the table.</p>

  <p>"There are three checks," he remarked, "which I cannot trace. One for ten
  thousand pounds, another for five, and a third for a thousand pounds. What
  account shall I put them to?"</p>

  <p>"Private drawing account," Wingrave answered. "They represent a small
  speculation. By the bye, you'd better go and ring up Walters."</p>

  <p>"Do you wish the particulars entered in your sundry investment book?"
  Aynesworth asked.</p>

  <p>Wingrave smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"I think not," he answered. "You can put them to drawing account. If you
  want me again this evening, I shall dine at the Cafe Royal at eight o'clock,
  and shall return here at five minutes to nine."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Lady Ruth was punctual. At a few minutes past nine, Morrison announced
  that a lady had called to see Mr. Wingrave by appointment.</p>

  <p>"You can show her in," Wingrave said. "See that we are not disturbed."</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth was scarcely herself. She was dressed in a high-necked muslin
  gown, and she wore a hat and veil, which somewhat obscured her features. The
  latter she raised, however, as she accepted the chair which Wingrave had
  placed for her. He saw then that she was pale, and her manner betrayed an
  altogether unfamiliar nervousness. She avoided his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Did you expect me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" he answered, "I thought that you would come."</p>

  <p>Her foot, long and slender, beat impatiently upon the ground. She looked
  up at him once, but immediately withdrew her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Why did you bring me here?" she asked in a low tone.</p>

  <p>"My dear Lady Ruth!" he protested.</p>

  <p>"If you want to play at being friends," she said, "for heaven's sake call
  me Ruth. You found it easy enough once."</p>

  <p>"You are very kind," he answered. "Ruth, by all means."</p>

  <p>"Now will you answer my question?" she said. "Do you mean&mdash;to help
  us?"</p>

  <p>"Us&mdash;no!" he answered; "you&mdash;perhaps yes!" he added.</p>

  <p>Then she looked at him, and found herself puzzled by the perfect
  impassivity of his features. Surely he would drop the mask now. He had
  insisted upon her coming!</p>

  <p>"Perhaps?" she repeated. "What then&mdash;are the conditions?"</p>

  <p>He bent over towards her. Curiously enough, there was, mingled with many
  other sensations, a certain sense of triumph in the thought, it was almost a
  hope, that at last he was going to betray himself, that he was going to admit
  tacitly, or by imputation, that her power over him was not wholly dead. It
  was a terrible situation&mdash;in her heart she felt so, but it had its
  compensations. Wingrave had been her constant attendant for months. He had
  seen her surrounded by men, all anxious to secure a smile from her; he had
  seen her play the great lady in her own house, and she played it very well.
  She knew that she was a past mistress in the arts which fascinate his sex,
  she understood the quiet speeches, the moods, every trick of the gamester in
  emotions, from the fluttering of eyelids to the unchaining of the passions.
  And he had loved her. Underneath it all, he must love her now. She was
  determined that he should tell her so. It was genuine excitement which
  throbbed in her pulses, a genuine color which burned in her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"The conditions?" he repeated. "You believe, then, that I mean to make
  conditions?"</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes to his, eloquent eyes she knew, and looked at him. The
  mask was still there&mdash;but he had moved a little nearer to her.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," she said softly. "You must tell me."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. She had scarcely given herself credit for
  such capacity for emotion. He was on his feet. Surely the mask must go now!
  And then&mdash;she felt that it must be a nightmare. It was incredible! He
  had struck a match and was calmly lighting a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"One," he said coolly, "is that Mademoiselle Violet employs no more
  amateur assassins to make clumsy attempts upon my life."</p>

  <p>She sat in her place rigid&mdash;half frozen with a cold, numbing fear. He
  had sent for her, then, only to mock her. She had failed! They were not even
  to have the money! Speech was quite impossible. Then he continued.</p>

  <p>"I will take your assent for granted," he said. "Do you know how much you
  require to free yourself?"</p>

  <p>"About eight thousand pounds!" she answered mechanically.</p>

  <p>He sat down and wrote a check, which he laid before her.</p>

  <p>"You will have to endorse that," he remarked in a matter-of-fact tone.
  "Your name at the back will do instead of a receipt."</p>

  <p>She sprang to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Keep your money," she cried. "I will not touch it. Please open the door
  for me! I am going."</p>

  <p>"By all means&mdash;if you wish it," he answered undisturbed. "At the same
  time, I am curious to know why you came here at all if you did not intend to
  accept it."</p>

  <p>She faced him, hot and angry.</p>

  <p>"I did intend to accept it," she declared. "It is that or ruin. But you
  are too cruel! You make it&mdash;impossible."</p>

  <p>"You surprise me," he answered. "I suppose you know best."</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake tell me," she cried passionately, "what has come to
  you, what manner of a man are you? You loved me once! Now, even, after all
  these years, you cannot deny it. You have gone out of your way to be with me,
  to be my companion wherever we are. People are beginning to smile when they
  see us together. I don't mind. I&mdash;for God's sake tell me, Wingrave! Why
  do you do it? Why do you lend me this money? What can I do for you? What do
  you want me to be? Are you as cold as a stone? Have you no heart&mdash;no
  heart even for friendship!"</p>

  <p>"I would not seek," he answered, "to buy&mdash;your friendship with a
  check!"</p>

  <p>"But it is yours already," she cried, holding out her hands. "Give me a
  little kindness, Wingrave! You make me feel and seem a perfect idiot. Why,
  I'd rather you asked me anything that treated me like this."</p>

  <p>"I was under the impression," Wingrave remarked, "that I was behaving
  rather well. I wonder what would really satisfy you!"</p>

  <p>"To have you behave as you are doing, and want to behave differently," she
  cried. "You are magnificent&mdash;but it is because you are indifferent. Will
  you kiss me, Wingrave?"</p>

  <p>"With pleasure!" he answered.</p>

  <p>She drew away from him quickly.</p>

  <p>"Is it&mdash;another woman?" she asked. "The Marchioness?"</p>

  <p>Her eagerness was almost painful. He did not answer her at once. She
  caught hold of his wrist and drew him towards her. Her eyes searched his
  face.</p>

  <p>"The Marchioness," he said, "is a very beautiful woman. She does not,
  however, affect the situation as between you and me."</p>

  <p>"If she dared!" Lady Ruth murmured. "Wingrave, won't you try and be
  friends with me?"</p>

  <p>"I will try&mdash;certainly," he answered. "You would be surprised,
  however, if you could realize the effect of a long period of enforced
  seclusion upon a man of my&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't!" she shrieked; "stop!"</p>

  <p>"My temperament, I was about to say," he concluded. "There was a time when
  I am afraid I might have been tempted, under such circumstances as these, to
  forget that you were no longer free, to forget everything that except we were
  alone, and that you&mdash;are as beautiful as ever you were!"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" she murmured, moving imperceptibly a little nearer towards him.</p>

  <p>He picked up the check and gave it to her.</p>

  <p>"I am no actor," he said, looking at her steadily. "At present, I make no
  conditions. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She leaned towards him. He took her face between his hands and kissed her
  on the lips.</p>

  <p>"I may make them later," he said. "I reserve my right."</p>

  <p>She looked at him for a moment, and dropped her veil.</p>

  <p>"Please take me down to my carriage," she asked.</p>

  <h2>IX. &mdash; THE INDISCRETION OF THE MARCHIONESS</h2>

  <p class="first">"I am perfectly certain," Juliet declared, "that we ought
  not to be here."</p>

  <p>"That," Aynesworth remarked, fanning himself lightly with his pocket
  handkerchief, "may account for the extraordinary sense of pleasure which I am
  now experiencing. At the same time, I can't see why not."</p>

  <p>"I only met you this afternoon&mdash;a few hours ago. And here we are,
  absolutely wedged together on these seats&mdash;and my chaperon is dozing
  half the time."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," Aynesworth objected, "I knew you when you were a child."</p>

  <p>"For one day!"</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," Aynesworth persisted, "the fact remains. If you date our
  acquaintance from this afternoon, I do not. I have never forgotten the little
  girl in short frocks and long black hair, who showed me where the seagulls
  built, and told me Cornish fairy stories."</p>

  <p>"It was a very long time ago," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"Four years," he answered; "for you, perhaps, a long time, because you
  have changed from a child&mdash;into a woman. But for a man approaching
  middle age&mdash;as I am&mdash;nothing!"</p>

  <p>"That is all very well," she answered, "but I am not sure that we ought to
  be in the gallery at Covent Garden together, with a chaperon who will
  sleep!"</p>

  <p>"She will wake up," he declared, "with the music."</p>

  <p>"And I," she murmured, "will dream. Isn't it lovely?"</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"I wonder how it really seems to you," he remarked. "We are breathing an
  atmosphere hot with gas, and fragrant with orange peel. We are squashed in
  amongst a crowd of people of a class whom I fancy that neither you nor I know
  much about. And I saw you last in a wilderness! We saw only the yellow sands,
  and the rocks, and the Atlantic. We heard only the thunder of the sea and the
  screaming of seagulls. This is very different."</p>

  <p>"Wonderfully, wonderfully different," she answered. "I miss it all! Of
  course I do, and yet one is so much nearer to life here, the real life of men
  and women. Oh, one cannot compare it. Why should one try? Ah, listen!"</p>

  <p>The curtain went up. The music of the orchestra subsided, and the music of
  the human voice floated through the Opera House&mdash;the human voice,
  vibrant with joy and passion and the knowledge which lies behind the veil.
  Juliet found no time to talk then, no time to think even of her companion.
  Her young cheeks were flushed, her eyes were bright with excitement. She
  leaned a little forward in her place, she passed with all the effortless
  facility of her ingenuous youth, into the dim world of golden fancies which
  the story of the opera was slowly unfolding. Beside her, Mrs. Tresfarwin
  dozed and blinked and dozed again&mdash;and on her left Aynesworth himself, a
  little affected by the music, still found time to glance continually at his
  companion, so radiant with life and so fervently intent upon realizing to the
  full this, the first of its unknown joys. So with crashing of chords and
  thunder of melody the act went on. And when it was over, Juliet thought no
  more of the Cornish sea and the lullaby of the waves. A new music was
  stirring in her young blood.</p>

  <p>They were in the front row of the gallery, and presently she leaned over
  to gaze down at the panorama below, the women in the boxes and stalls, whose
  bare shoulders and skillfully coiffured hair flashed with jewels. Suddenly
  her hand fell upon Aynesworth's arm.</p>

  <p>"Look!" she cried in some excitement, "do you see who that is in the box
  there&mdash;the one almost next to the stage?"</p>

  <p>Aynesworth, too, uttered a little exclamation. The lights from beneath
  were falling full upon the still, cold face of the man who had just taken a
  vacant chair in one of the boxes.</p>

  <p>"Wingrave!" he exclaimed, and glanced at once at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Sir Wingrave Seton," she murmured. "Isn't it strange that I should see
  him here tonight?"</p>

  <p>"He comes often," Aynesworth answered. "Music is one of his few
  weaknesses."</p>

  <p>There was a movement in the box, and a woman's head and shoulders appeared
  from behind the curtain. Juliet gave a little gasp.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Aynesworth," she exclaimed, "did you ever see such a beautiful woman?
  Do tell me who she is!"</p>

  <p>"A very great lady in London society," Aynesworth answered. "That is
  Emily, Marchioness of Westchester."</p>

  <p>Juliet's eyes never moved from her until the beautiful neck and shoulders
  were turned away. She leaned over towards her companion, and she did not
  again, for some few minutes, face the house.</p>

  <p>"She is the loveliest woman I ever saw in my life," Juliet said with a
  little sigh. "Is she a great friend of Sir Wingrave Seton, Mr.
  Aynesworth?"</p>

  <p>"He has no friends," Aynesworth answered. "I believe that they are very
  well acquainted."</p>

  <p>"Poor Sir Wingrave!" Juliet murmured softly.</p>

  <p>Aynesworth looked at her in some surprise.</p>

  <p>"It is odd that you should have recognized him from up here," he remarked
  thoughtfully. "He has changed so much during the last few years."</p>

  <p>Juliet smiled, but she did not explain. She felt that she was obeying
  Wingrave's wishes.</p>

  <p>"I should have recognized him anywhere," she answered simply. "I wonder
  what they are talking about. She seems so interested, and he looks so
  bored."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth looked at his watch. It was barely ten o'clock.</p>

  <p>"I am very glad to see him here this evening," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I should like so much," she said, still gazing at them earnestly, "to
  know that they are talking about."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>"So you will not tell me," the Marchioness murmured, ceasing for a moment
  the graceful movements of her fan, and looking at him steadily. "You refuse
  me this&mdash;almost the first thing I have ever asked you?"</p>

  <p>"It is scarcely," Wingrave objected, "a reasonable question."</p>

  <p>"Between you and me," she murmured, "such punctiliousness is scarcely
  necessary&mdash;is it?"</p>

  <p>He withstood the attack of those wonderful eyes lifted swiftly to his, and
  answered her gravely.</p>

  <p>"You are Lady Ruth's friend," he remarked. "Probably, therefore, she will
  tell you all about it."</p>

  <p>The Marchioness laughed softly, yet with something less than mirth.</p>

  <p>"Friends," she exclaimed, "Lady Ruth and I? There was never a woman in
  this world who was less my friend&mdash;especially now!"</p>

  <p>He asked for no explanation of her last words, but in a moment or two she
  vouchsafed it. She leaned a little forward, her eyes flashed softly through
  the semi-darkness.</p>

  <p>"Lady Ruth is afraid," she said quietly, "that I might take you away from
  her."</p>

  <p>"My dear lady," he protested, "the slight friendship between Lady Ruth and
  myself is not of the nature to engender such a fear."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her beautiful shoulders. Her hands were toying with the rope
  of pearls which hung from her neck. She bent over them, as though examining
  the color of the stones.</p>

  <p>"How long have you known Ruth?" she asked quietly.</p>

  <p>He looked at her steadfastly. He could not be sure whether it was his
  fancy, or whether indeed there was some hidden meaning in her question.</p>

  <p>"Since I came to live in England," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. Then with a little wave of her hands and a
  brilliant smile, she figuratively dismissed the subject.</p>

  <p>"We waste time," she remarked lightly, "and we may have callers at any
  moment. I will ask you no more questions save those which the conventions may
  permit you to answer truthfully. We can't depart from our code, can we, even
  for the sake of an inquisitive woman?"</p>

  <p>"I can assure you&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"But I will have no assurances," she interrupted smilingly. "I am going to
  talk of other things. I am going to ask you a ridiculous question. Are you
  fond of music?&mdash;seriously!"</p>

  <p>"I believe so," he answered. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because," she answered, "I sometimes wonder what there is in the world
  that interests you! Certainly, none of the ordinary things seem to. Tonight,
  almost for the first time, I saw you look a little drawn out of yourself. I
  was wondering whether it was the music or the people. I suppose, until one
  gets used to it," she added, looking a little wearily around the house, "an
  audience like this is worth looking at."</p>

  <p>"It certainly is not the people," he said. "Do you make as close a study
  of all your acquaintances?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally not," she answered, "and I do not class you amongst my
  acquaintances at all. You interest me, my friend&mdash;very much indeed!"</p>

  <p>"I am flattered," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"You are not&mdash;I wish that you were," she answered simply. "I can
  understand why you have succeeded where so many others have failed. You are
  strong. You have nerves of steel&mdash;and very little heart. But
  now&mdash;what are you going to do with your life, now that wealth must even
  have lost its meaning to you? I should like to know that. Will you tell
  me?"</p>

  <p>"What is there to do?" he asked. "Eat and drink, and juggle a little with
  the ball of fate."</p>

  <p>"You are not ambitious?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least."</p>

  <p>"Pleasure, for itself, does not attract you. No! I know that it does not.
  What are you going to do, then?"</p>

  <p>"I have no idea," he answered. "Won't you direct me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will," she answered, "if you will pay my price."</p>

  <p>He looked at her more intently. He himself had been attaching no
  particular importance to this conversation, but he was suddenly conscious
  that it was not so with the woman at his side. Her eyes were shining at him,
  soft and full and sweet; her beautiful bosom was rising and falling quickly;
  there had come to her something which even he was forced to recognize, that
  curious and voluptuous abandonment which a woman rarely permits herself, and
  can never assume. He was a little bewildered. His speech lost for a moment
  its cold precision.</p>

  <p>"Your price?" he repeated. "I&mdash;I am stupid. I'm afraid I don't
  understand."</p>

  <p>"Marry me," she whispered in his ear, "and I will take you a little
  further into life than you could ever go alone You don't care for me, of
  course&mdash;but you shall. You don't understand this world, Wingrave, or how
  to make the best of it. I do! Let me be your guide!"</p>

  <p>Wingrave looked at her in grave astonishment.</p>

  <p>"You are not by any chance&mdash;in earnest?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You know very well that I am," she answered swiftly. "And yet you
  hesitate! What is it that you are afraid of? Don't you like to give up your
  liberty? We need not marry unless you choose. That is only a matter of form
  nowadays at any rate. I have a hundred chaperons to choose from. Society
  expects strange things from me. It is your companionship I want. Your money
  is fascinating, of course. I should like to see you spend it, to spend it
  with both hands. Don't be afraid that we should be talked about. I am not
  Lady Ruth! I am Emily, Marchioness of Westchester, and I live and choose my
  friends as I please; will you be chief amongst them? Hush!"</p>

  <p>For Wingrave it was providential. The loud chorus which had heralded the
  upraising of the curtain died away. Melba's first few notes were floating
  through the house. Silence was a necessity. The low passion of the music
  rippled from the stage, through the senses and into the hearts of many of the
  listeners. But Wingrave listened silent and unmoved. He was even unconscious
  that the woman by his side was watching him half anxiously every now and
  then.</p>

  <p>The curtain descended amidst a thunder of applause. Wingrave turned slowly
  towards his companion. And then there came a respite&mdash;a knock at the
  door.</p>

  <p>The Marchioness frowned, but Wingrave was already holding it open. Lady
  Ruth, followed by an immaculate young guardsman, a relative of her husband,
  was standing there.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Wingrave!" she exclaimed softly, with upraised eyebrows, "why have
  you contrived to render yourself invisible? We thought you were alone,
  Emily," she continued, "and took pity on you. And all the time you had a
  prize."</p>

  <p>The Marchioness looked at Lady Ruth, and Lady Ruth looked at the
  Marchioness. The young guardsman was a little sorry that he had come, but
  Lady Ruth never turned a hair.</p>

  <p>"You must really have your eyes seen to, dear," the Marchioness remarked
  in a tone of tender concern. "When you can't see such an old friend as Mr.
  Wingrave from a few yards away, they must be very bad indeed. How are you,
  Captain Kendrick? Come and tell me about the polo this afternoon. Sorry I
  can't offer you all chairs. This is an absurd box&mdash;it was only meant for
  two!"</p>

  <p>"Come into ours," Lady Ruth said; "we have chairs for six, I think."</p>

  <p>The Marchioness shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I wish I had a millionaire in the family," she murmured. "All the same, I
  hate large parties. I am old-fashioned enough to think that two is a
  delightful number."</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth laid her hand upon Wingrave's arm.</p>

  <p>"A decided hint, Mr. Wingrave," she declared. "Come and let me introduce
  you to my sister. Our box is only a few yards off."</p>

  <h2>X. &mdash; "I AM MISANTHROPOS, AND HATE MANKIND"</h2>

  <p class="first">Wingrave had just come in from an early gallop. His pale
  cheeks were slightly flushed, and his eyes were bright. He had been riding
  hard to escape from disconcerting thoughts. He looked in at the study, and
  found Aynesworth with a mass of correspondence before him.</p>

  <p>"Anything important?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," Aynesworth answered. "The letters marked private I have sent up
  to your room. By the bye, there was something I wanted to tell you."</p>

  <p>Wingrave closed the door.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I was up in the gallery of the Opera House last night," Aynesworth said,
  "with a&mdash;person who saw you only once, soon after I first came to
  you&mdash;before America. You were some distance away, and yet&mdash;my
  friend recognized you."</p>

  <p>Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"That, of course, is possible," he answered. "It really does not matter so
  very much unless they knew me&mdash;as Wingrave Seton!"</p>

  <p>"My friend," Aynesworth said, "recognized you as Sir Wingrave Seton."</p>

  <p>Wingrave frowned thoughtfully for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Who was it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"A most unlikely person," Aynesworth remarked smiling. "Do you remember,
  when we went down to Tredowen just before we left for America, a little,
  long-legged, black-frocked child, whom we met in the gardens&mdash;the
  organist's daughter, you know?"</p>

  <p>"What of her?" Wingrave asked.</p>

  <p>"It was she who was with me," Aynesworth remarked. "It was she who saw you
  in the box with the Marchioness of Westchester."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth was puzzled by the intentness with which Wingrave was regarding
  him. Impenetrable though the man was, Aynesworth, who had not yet lost his
  early trick of studying him closely, knew that, for some reason or other, his
  intelligence had proved disturbing.</p>

  <p>"Have you then&mdash;kept up your acquaintance with this child?" he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>Aynesworth shook his head.</p>

  <p>"She is not a child any longer, but a very beautiful young woman," he
  said. "I met her again quite by accident. She is up in London, studying art
  at the studio of an old friend of mine who has a class of girls. I called to
  see him the other afternoon, and recognized her."</p>

  <p>"Your acquaintance," Wingrave remarked, "has progressed rapidly if she
  accepts your escort&mdash;to the gallery of the Opera!"</p>

  <p>"It was scarcely like that," Aynesworth explained. "I met her and Mrs.
  Tresfarwin on the way there, and asked to be allowed to accompany them. Mrs.
  Tresfarwin was once your housekeeper, I think, at Tredowen."</p>

  <p>"And did you solve the mystery of this relation of her father who turned
  up so opportunely?" Wingrave asked.</p>

  <p>Aynesworth shook his head.</p>

  <p>"She told me nothing about him," he answered.</p>

  <p>Wingrave passed on to his own room. His breakfast was on the table
  awaiting him, and a little pile of letters and newspapers stood by his plate.
  His servant, his head groom, and his chauffeur were there to receive their
  orders for the morning. About him were all the evidences of his well-ordered
  life. He sent both the men away and locked the door. It was half an hour
  before he touched either his breakfast or his letters....</p>

  <p>He lunched at Westchester House in obedience to a somewhat imperative
  summons. There were other guests there, whom, however, he outstayed. As soon
  as they were alone, his hostess touched him on the arm and led him to her own
  room.</p>

  <p>"At last!" she exclaimed, with an air of real relief. "There, sit down
  opposite to me, please&mdash;I want to watch your face."</p>

  <p>She was a little paler than usual, and he noticed that she had avoided
  talking much to him at luncheon time. And yet he thought that he had never
  seen her more beautiful. Something in her face had altered. He could not tell
  what it was for he was not a man of much experience as regarded her sex. Yet,
  in a vague sort of way, he understood the change. A certain part of the
  almost insolent quietness, the complete self-assurance of her manner, had
  gone. She was a little more like an ordinary woman!</p>

  <p>"Lady Ruth proved herself an excellent tactician last night," she
  remarked. "She has given me an exceedingly uncomfortable few hours. For you,
  well for you it was a respite, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I should call it exactly that," he answered
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>She looked at him steadfastly, almost wistfully.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, "I am not going to make excuses for myself. But the
  things which one says naturally enough when the emotions provoke them sound
  crude enough in cold blood and colder daylight. We women are creatures of
  mood, you know. I was feeling a little lonely and a little tired last night,
  and the music stole away my common sense."</p>

  <p>"I understand," he murmured. "All that you said shall be forgotten."</p>

  <p>"Then you do not understand," she answered, smiling at him. "What I said I
  do not wish to be forgotten. Only&mdash;just at that moment, it sounded
  natural enough&mdash;and today&mdash;I think that I am a little ashamed."</p>

  <p>He rose from his seat. Her eyes leaped up to his expectantly, and the
  color streamed into her cheeks. But he only stood by her side. He did nothing
  to meet the half-proffered embrace.</p>

  <p>"Dear Lady Emily," he said, "all the kind things that you said were spoken
  to a stranger. You did not know me. I did not mean anyone to know me. It is
  you who have commanded the truth. You must have it. I am not the person I
  seem to be. I am not the person to whom words such as yours should have been
  spoken. Even my name is an assumed one. I should prefer to leave it at
  that&mdash;if you are content."</p>

  <p>"I am not content," she answered quietly; "I must hear more."</p>

  <p>He bowed.</p>

  <p>"I am a man," he said, "who spent ten years in prison, the ten best years
  of my life. A woman sent me there&mdash;a woman swore my liberty away to save
  her reputation. I was never of a forgiving disposition, I was never an
  amiably disposed person. I want you to understand this. Any of the ordinary
  good qualities with which the average man may be endowed, and which I may
  have possessed, are as dead in me as hell fire could burn them. You have
  spoken of me as of a man who failed to find a sufficient object in life. You
  were wrong. I have an object, and I do my best to live up to it. I hate the
  whole world of men and women who laughed their way through life whilst I
  suffered&mdash;tortures. I hate the woman who sent me there. I have no heart,
  nor any sense of pity. Now perhaps you can understand my life and the manner
  of it."</p>

  <p>Her hands were clasped to the side of her head. Something of horror had
  stolen into the steadfast gaze with which she was still regarding him. Yet
  there were other things there which puzzled him.</p>

  <p>"This&mdash;is terrible!" she murmured. "Then you are not&mdash;Mr.
  Wingrave at all?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated. After all, it was scarcely worth while concealing anything
  now.</p>

  <p>"I am Sir Wingrave Seton," he said. "You may remember my little
  affair!"</p>

  <p>She caught hold of his hands.</p>

  <p>"You poor, poor dear!" she cried. "How you must have suffered!"</p>

  <p>Wingrave had a terrible moment. What he felt he would never have admitted,
  even to himself. Her eyes were shining with sympathy, and it was so
  unexpected. He had expected something in the nature of a cold withdrawal; her
  silence was the only thing he had counted upon. It was a fierce, but short
  battle. His sudden grasp of her hands was relaxed. He stood away from
  her.</p>

  <p>"You are very kind," he said. "As you can doubtless imagine, it is a
  little too late for sympathy. The years have gone, and the better part of me,
  if ever there was a better part, with them."</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure of that!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>He looked at her coldly.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"If you were absolutely heartless," she said, "if you were perfectly
  consistent, why did you not make me suffer? You had a great chance! A little
  feigned affection, and then a few truths. You could have dragged me down a
  little way into the pit of broken hearts! Why didn't you?"</p>

  <p>He frowned.</p>

  <p>"One is forced to neglect a few opportunities!"</p>

  <p>She smiled at him&mdash;delightfully.</p>

  <p>"You foolish man!" she murmured. "Some day or other, you will turn out to
  be a terrible impostor. Do you know, I think I am going to ask you
  again&mdash;what I asked you last night?"</p>

  <p>"I scarcely think that you will be so ill-advised," he declared coldly.
  "Whether you believe it or not, I can assure you that I am incapable of
  affection."</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure about that," she said with protesting eyebrows, "but you
  are terribly hard-hearted?"</p>

  <p>He was entirely dissatisfied with the impression he had produced. He
  considered the attitude of the Marchioness unjustifiably frivolous. He had an
  uneasy conviction that she was not in the least inclined to take him
  seriously.</p>

  <p>"I don't think," he said, glancing at the clock, "that I need detain you
  any longer."</p>

  <p>"You are really going away, then?" she asked him softly.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"To call on Lady Ruth, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"As it happens, no," he answered.</p>

  <p>Suddenly her face changed&mdash;she had remembered something.</p>

  <p>"It was Lady Ruth!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Exactly!" he interrupted.</p>

  <p>"What a triumph of inconsistency!" she declared scornfully. "You are
  lending them money!"</p>

  <p>"I am lending money to Lady Ruth," he answered slowly.</p>

  <p>Their eyes met. She understood, at any rate, what he intended to convey.
  Certainly his expression was hard and merciless enough now!</p>

  <p>"Poor Ruth," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Some day," he answered, "you will probably say that in earnest."</p>

  <h2>XI. &mdash; JULIET GAINS EXPERIENCE</h2>

  <p class="first">"Of course," Juliet said, "after Tredowen it seems very
  small, almost poky, but it isn't, really, and Tredowen was not for me all my
  days. It was quite time I got used to something else."</p>

  <p>Wingrave looked around him with expressionless face. It was a tiny room,
  high up on the fifth floor of a block of flats, prettily but inexpensively
  furnished. Juliet herself, tall and slim, with all the fire of youth and
  perfect health on her young face, was obviously contented.</p>

  <p>"And your work?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"I have a good deal to unlearn," she said, "but Mr. Pleydell is very kind
  and encouraging."</p>

  <p>"You will go down to Cornwall for the hot weather, I hope?" he said.
  "London is unbearable in August."</p>

  <p>"The class are going for a sketching tour to Normandy," she said, "and Mr.
  Pleydell thought that I might like to join them. It is very inexpensive, and
  I should be able to go on with my work all the time."</p>

  <p>He nodded thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I hear," he said, "that you have met Mr. Aynesworth again."</p>

  <p>"Wasn't it delightful?" she exclaimed. "He is quite an old friend of Mr.
  Pleydell. I was so glad to see him."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he remarked, "you are a little lonely sometimes?"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes," she admitted. "But I sha'n't be when I get to know the girls
  in the class a little better."</p>

  <p>"I have some friends," he said thoughtfully, "women, of course, who would
  come and see you with pleasure. And yet," he added, "I am not sure that you
  would not be better off without knowing them."</p>

  <p>"They are fashionable ladies, perhaps?" she said simply.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"They belong to the Juggernaut here which is called society. They would
  probably try to draw you a little way into its meshes. I think, yes, I am
  sure," he added, looking at her, "that you are better off outside."</p>

  <p>"And I am quite sure of it," she answered laughing. "I haven't the clothes
  or the time or the inclination for that sort of thing. Besides, I am going to
  be much too happy ever to be lonely."</p>

  <p>"I myself," he said, "am not an impressionable person. But they tell me
  that most people, especially of your age, find London a terribly lonely
  place."</p>

  <p>"I can understand that," she answered, "unless they really had something
  definite to do. I have felt a little of that myself. I think London frightens
  me a little. It is so different from the country, and there is a great deal
  that is difficult to understand."</p>

  <p>"For instance?"</p>

  <p>"The great number of poor people who find it so hard to live," she
  answered. "Some of the small houses round here are awful, and Mr.
  Malcolm&mdash;he is the vicar of the church here, and he called
  yesterday&mdash;tells me that they are nothing like so bad as in some other
  parts of London. And then you take a bus, it is such a short
  distance&mdash;and the shops are full of wonderful things at such fabulous
  prices, and the carriages and houses are so lovely, and people seem to be
  showering money right and left everywhere."</p>

  <p>"It is the same in all large cities," he answered, "more or less. There
  must always be rich and poor, when a great community are herded together. As
  a rule, the extreme poor are a worthless lot."</p>

  <p>"There must be some of them, though," she answered, "who deserve to have a
  better time. Of course, I have never been outside Tredowen, where everyone
  was contented and happy in their way, and it seems terrible to me just at
  first. I can't bear to think that everyone hasn't at least a chance of
  happiness."</p>

  <p>"You are too young," he said, "to bother your head about these things yet.
  Wait until you have gathered in a little philosophy with the years. Then you
  will understand how helpless you are to alter by ever so little the existing
  state of things, and it will trouble you less."</p>

  <p>"I," she answered, "may, of course, be helpless, but what about those
  people who have huge fortunes, and still do nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Why should they?" he answered coldly. "This is a world for individual
  effort. No man is strong enough to carry even a single one of his fellows
  upon his shoulders. Charity is the most illogical and pernicious of all
  weaknesses."</p>

  <p>"Now you are laughing at me," she declared. "I mean men like that Mr.
  Wingrave, the American who has come to England to spend all his millions. I
  have just been reading about him," she added, pointing to an illustrated
  paper on the table. "They say that his income is too vast to be put into
  figures which would sound reasonable; that he has estates and shooting
  properties, and a yacht which he has never yet even seen. And yet he will not
  give one penny away. He gives nothing to the hospitals, nothing to the poor.
  He spends his money on himself, and himself alone!"</p>

  <p>Wingrave smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"I am not prepared to defend my namesake," he said; "but every man has a
  right to do what he likes with his own, hasn't he? And as for hospitals, Mr.
  Wingrave probably thinks, like a good many more, that they should be state
  endowed. People could make use of them, then, without loss of self
  respect."</p>

  <p>She shook her head a little doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"I can't argue about it yet," she said, "because I haven't thought about
  it long enough. But I know if I had all the money this man has, I couldn't be
  happy to spend thousands and thousands upon myself while there were people
  almost starving in the same city."</p>

  <p>"You are a sentimentalist, you see," he remarked, "and you have not
  studied the laws on which society is based. Tell me, how does Mrs. Tresfarwin
  like London?"</p>

  <p>Juliet laughed merrily.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it amusing?" she declared. "She loves it! She grumbles at the milk,
  and we have the butter from Tredowen. Everything else she finds perfection.
  She doesn't even mind the five flights of stone steps."</p>

  <p>"Social problems," Wingrave remarked, "do not trouble her."</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," Juliet declared. "She spends all her pennies on
  beggars and omnibus rides, and she is perfectly happy."</p>

  <p>Wingrave rose to go in a few minutes. Juliet walked with him to the
  door.</p>

  <p>"I am going to be really hospitable," she declared. "I am going to walk
  with you to the street."</p>

  <p>"All down those five flights?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Every one of them!"</p>

  <p>They commenced the descent.</p>

  <p>"There is something about a flat," she declared, "which makes one horribly
  curious about one's neighbors&mdash;especially if one has never had any. All
  these closed doors may hide no end of interesting people, and I have never
  seen a soul go in or out. How did you like all this climbing?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I didn't appreciate it," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you won't come to see me again, then?" she asked. "I hope you
  will."</p>

  <p>"I will come," he said a little stiffly, "with pleasure!"</p>

  <p>They were on the ground floor, and Juliet opened the door. Wingrave's
  motor was outside, and the man touched his hat. She gave a little breathless
  cry.</p>

  <p>"It isn't yours?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he answered. "Do you want to come and look at it?"</p>

  <p>"Rather!" she exclaimed. "I have never seen one close to in my life."</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I'll take you a little way, if you like," he said.</p>

  <p>Her cheeks were pink with excitement.</p>

  <p>"If I like! And I've never been in one before! I'll fly up for my hat. I
  sha'n't be a moment."</p>

  <p>She was already halfway up the first flight of stairs, with a whirl of
  skirts and flying feet. Wingrave lit a cigarette and stood for a moment
  thoughtfully upon the pavement. Then he shrugged his shoulders. His face had
  grown a little harder.</p>

  <p>"She must take her chances," he muttered. "No one knows her. Nobody is
  likely to find out who she is."</p>

  <p>She was down again in less time than seemed possible. Her cheeks were
  flushed and her eyes bright with excitement. Wingrave took the wheel himself,
  and she sat up by his side. They glided off almost noiselessly.</p>

  <p>"We will go up to the Park," he said. "It is just the time to see the
  people."</p>

  <p>"Anywhere!" she exclaimed. "This is too lovely!"</p>

  <p>They passed from Battersea northwards into Piccadilly, and down into the
  Park. Juliet was too excited to talk; Wingrave had enough to do to drive the
  car. They passed plenty of people who bowed, and many who glanced with
  wondering admiration at the beautiful girl who sat by Wingrave's side. Lady
  Ruth, who drive by quickly in a barouche, almost rose from her seat; the
  Marchioness, whose victoria they passed, had time to wave her hand and flash
  a quick, searching glance at Juliet, who returned it with her dark eyes
  filled with admiration. The Marchioness smiled to herself a little sadly as
  the car shot away ahead.</p>

  <p>"If one asked," she murmured to herself, "he would try to persuade one
  that it was another victim."</p>

  <h2>XII. &mdash; NEMESIS AT WORK</h2>

  <p class="first">Wingrave was present that evening at a reception given by
  the Prime Minister to some distinguished foreign guests. He had scarcely
  exchanged the usual courtesies with his host and hostess before Lady Ruth,
  leaning over from a little group, whispered in his ear.</p>

  <p>"Please take me away. I am bored. I want to talk to you."</p>

  <p>He paused at once. Lady Ruth nodded to her friends.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Wingrave is going to take me to hear Melba sing," she said. "See you
  all again, I suppose, at Hereford House!"</p>

  <p>They made slow progress through the crowded rooms. Once or twice Wingrave
  fancied that his companion hung a little heavily upon his arm. She showed no
  desire to talk. She even answered a remark of his in a monosyllable. Only
  when they passed the Marchioness, on the arm of one of the foreign guests in
  whose honor the reception was given, she seemed to shiver a little, and her
  grasp upon his arm was tightened. Once, in a block, she was forced to speak
  to some acquaintances, and during those few seconds, Wingrave studied her
  curiously. She was absolutely colorless, and her strange brilliant eyes
  seemed to have lost all their fire. Her gown was black, and the decorations
  of her hair were black except for a single diamond. There was something
  almost spectral about her appearance. She walked stiffly&mdash;for the moment
  she had lost the sinuous grace of movement which had been one of her many
  fascinations. Her neck and shoulders alone remained, as ever, dazzlingly
  beautiful.</p>

  <p>They reached a quiet corner at last. Lady Ruth sank with a little gesture
  of relief into an easy chair. Wingrave stood before her.</p>

  <p>"You are tired tonight," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I am always tired," she answered wearily. "I begin to think that I always
  shall be."</p>

  <p>He said nothing. Lady Ruth closed her eyes for a moment as though from
  sheer fatigue. Suddenly she opened them again and looked him full in the
  face.</p>

  <p>"Who was she?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I do not understand," he replied.</p>

  <p>"The child you were with&mdash;the ingenue, you know&mdash;with the pink
  cheeks and the wonderful eyes! Is she from one of the theaters, or a genuine
  article?"</p>

  <p>"The young lady to whom you refer," he answered, "is the daughter of an
  old friend of mine. I am practically her guardian. She is in London studying
  painting."</p>

  <p>"You are her guardian?" Lady Ruth repeated. "I am sorry for her."</p>

  <p>"You need not be," he answered. "I trust that I shall be able to fulfill
  my duties in a perfectly satisfactory manner."</p>

  <p>"Oh! I have no doubt of it," she answered. "Yet I am sorry for her."</p>

  <p>"You are certainly," he remarked, "not in an amiable mood."</p>

  <p>"I am in rather a desperate one if that is anything," she said, looking at
  him with something of the old light in her tired eyes.</p>

  <p>"You made a little error, perhaps, in those calculations?" he suggested.
  "It can be amended."</p>

  <p>"Don't be a brute," she answered fiercely.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"That sounds a little severe," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Don't take any notice of anything I say tonight," she murmured softly. "I
  am a little mad. I think that everything is going against me! I know that you
  haven't a grain of sympathy for me&mdash;that you would rather see me suffer
  than not, and yet you see I give myself away entirely. Why shouldn't I? Part
  of it is through you in a way."</p>

  <p>"I rather fancied," he remarked, "that up to now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes! Of course!" she interrupted, "you saved me from ruin, staved it off
  at any rate. And you held over the reckoning! I&mdash;I almost
  wish&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused. Again her eyes were searching his.</p>

  <p>"I am a little tired of it all, you see," she continued. "I don't suppose
  Lumley and I can ever be the same again since I brought him&mdash;that check.
  He avoids being alone with me&mdash;I do the same with him. One would
  think&mdash;to watch the people, that the whole transaction was in the
  Morning Post. They smile when they see us together, they grin when they see
  you with anybody else. It's getting hateful, Wingrave!"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said quietly, "that you are in a nervous, hypersensitive
  state. No one else can possibly know of the little transaction between us,
  and, so far as I am concerned, there has been nothing to interfere with your
  relations with your husband."</p>

  <p>"You are right," she answered, "I am losing my nerve. I am only afraid
  that I am losing something else. I haven't an ounce of battle left in me. I
  feel that I should like to close my eyes and wake up in a new world, and
  start all over again."</p>

  <p>"It is nothing but a mood," he assured her. "Those new worlds don't exist
  any longer. They generally consist of foreign watering places where the sheep
  and the goats house together now and then. I think I should play the game
  out, Lady Ruth, until&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Until what?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps to the end," he answered. "Who can tell? Not I! By this time
  tomorrow, it might be I who would be reminding you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"That there are other worlds, and other lives to live!"</p>

  <p>"I should like," she whispered very softly, "to hear of them. But I fancy
  somehow that you will never be my instructor. What of your ward?"</p>

  <p>"Well! What of her?" he answered calmly.</p>

  <p>She shivered a little.</p>

  <p>"You were very frank with me once, Wingrave," she said. "You are a man
  whose life fate has wrecked, fate and I! You have no heart left, no feeling.
  You can create suffering and find it amusing. I am beginning to realize
  that."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"There is some truth," he declared, "In what you say."</p>

  <p>"What of that child? Is she, too, to be a victim?"</p>

  <p>"I trust," he answered, "that you are not going to be melodramatic."</p>

  <p>"I don't call it that. I really want to know. I should like to warn
  her."</p>

  <p>"I am not at war with children," he answered. "Her life and mine are as
  far apart as the poles."</p>

  <p>"I had an odd fancy when I saw you with her," Lady Ruth said slowly. "She
  is very good-looking&mdash;and not so absurdly young."</p>

  <p>"The fancy was one," he remarked coldly, "which I think you had better get
  rid of."</p>

  <p>"In a way," she continued thoughtfully, "I should like to get rid of it,
  and yet&mdash;how old are you, Wingrave? Well, I know. You are very little
  over forty. You are barely in the prime of life, you are strong, you have the
  one thing which society today counts almost divine&mdash;great, immeasurable
  wealth! Can't you find someone to thaw the snows?"</p>

  <p>"I loved a woman once," he answered. "It was a long time ago, and it seems
  strange to me now."</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth lifted her eyes to his, and their lambent fires were suddenly
  rekindled.</p>

  <p>"Love her again," she murmured. "What is past is past, but there are the
  days to come! Perhaps the woman, too, is a little lonely."</p>

  <p>"I think not," he answered calmly. "The woman is married, she has lived
  with her husband more or less happily for a dozen years or so! She is a
  little ambitious, a little fond of pleasure, but a leader of society, and, I
  am sure, a very reputable member of it. To love her again would be as
  embarrassing to her&mdash;as it would be difficult for me. You, my dear Lady
  Ruth, I am convinced, would be the last to approve of it."</p>

  <p>"You mock me," she murmured, bending her head. "Is forgiveness also an
  impossibility?"</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "that any sentiment whatever between those two would
  be singularly misplaced. You spoke of Melba, I think! She is singing in the
  further room."</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth rose up, still and pale. There was fear in her eyes when she
  looked at him.</p>

  <p>"Is it to be always like this, then?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he answered, "I am no prophet. Who can tell what the days may bring?
  In the meantime..."</p>

  <p>The Marchioness was very much in request that evening, and she found time
  for only a few words with Wingrave.</p>

  <p>"What have you been doing to poor Ruth?" she asked. "I never saw her look
  so ill!"</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" he answered, "I had not noticed it."</p>

  <p>"If I didn't know her better," she remarked, "I might begin to suspect her
  of a conscience. Whose baby were you driving about this afternoon? I didn't
  know that your taste ran to ingenues to such an extent. She's sweetly pretty,
  but I don't think it's nice of you to flaunt her before us middle-aged
  people. It's enough to drive us to the rouge box. Come to lunch
  tomorrow!"</p>

  <p>"I shall be delighted," he answered, and passed on.</p>

  <p>An hour or so later, on his way out, he came upon Lady Ruth sitting a
  little forlornly in the hall.</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether I dare ask you to drop me in Cadogan Square?" she asked.
  "Is it much out of your way? I am leaving a little earlier than I
  expected."</p>

  <p>"I shall be delighted," he answered, offering his arm.</p>

  <p>They passed out of the door and down the covered way into the street. A
  few stragglers were loitering on the pavement, and one, a tall, thin young
  man in a long ulster, bent forwards as they came down the steps. Wingrave
  felt his companion's grasp tighten upon his arm; a flash of light upon the
  pale features and staring eyes of the young man a few feet off, showed him to
  be in the act of intercepting them. Then, at a sharp word from Wingrave, a
  policeman stretched out his arm. The young man was pushed unceremoniously
  away. Wingrave's tall footman and the policeman formed an impassable
  barrier&mdash;in a moment the electric brougham was gliding down the street.
  Lady Ruth was leaning back amongst the cushions, and the hand which fell
  suddenly upon Wingrave's was cold as ice!</p>

  <h2>XIII. &mdash; RICHARDSON TRIES AGAIN</h2>

  <p class="first">"You saw&mdash;who that was?"</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth's voice seemed to come from a greater distance. Wingrave turned
  and looked at her with calm curiosity. She was leaning back in the corner of
  the carriage, and she seemed somehow to have shrunk into an unusual
  insignificance. Her eyes alone were clearly visible through the
  semi-darkness&mdash;and the light which shone from their depths was the light
  of fear.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered slowly, "I believe that I recognized him. It was the
  young man who persists in some strange hallucination as to a certain
  Mademoiselle Violet."</p>

  <p>"It was no hallucination," she answered. "You know that! I was
  Mademoiselle Violet!"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"It amazes me," he said thoughtfully, "that you should have stooped to
  such folly. That my demise would have been a relief to you I can, of course,
  easily believe, but the means&mdash;they surely were not worthy of your
  ingenuity."</p>

  <p>"Don't!" she cried sharply. "I must have been utterly, miserably mad!"</p>

  <p>"Even the greatest of schemers have their wild moments," he remarked
  consolingly. "This was one of yours. You paid me a very poor compliment, by
  the bye, to imagine that an insignificant creature like that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Will you&mdash;leave off?" she moaned.</p>

  <p>"I daresay," he continued after a moment's pause, "that you find him now
  quite an inconvenient person to deal with."</p>

  <p>She shuddered.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am paying for my folly, if that is what you mean," she declared.
  "He knows&mdash;who I am&mdash;that he was deceived. He follows me
  about&mdash;everywhere."</p>

  <p>Wingrave glanced out of the carriage window.</p>

  <p>"Unless I am very much surprised," he answered, "he is following us
  now!"</p>

  <p>She came a little closer to him.</p>

  <p>"You won't leave me? Promise!"</p>

  <p>"I will see you home," he answered.</p>

  <p>"You are coming on to Hereford House."</p>

  <p>"I think not," he answered; "I have had enough of society for one
  evening."</p>

  <p>"Emily will be there later," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Even Lady Emily," he answered, "will not tempt me. I will see you safely
  inside. Afterwards, if your persistent follower is hanging about, I will
  endeavor to talk him into a more reasonable frame of mind."</p>

  <p>She was silent for a moment. Then she turned to him abruptly.</p>

  <p>"You are more kind to me sometimes than I deserve, Wingrave," she
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"It is not kindness," he answered. "I dislike absurd situations. Here we
  are! Permit me!"</p>

  <p>Wingrave kept his word. He saw Lady Ruth to her front door, and then
  turned back towards his carriage. Standing by the side of the footman, a
  little breathless, haggard and disheveled-looking, was the young man who had
  attempted to check their progress a few minutes ago.</p>

  <p>Wingrave took hold of his arm firmly.</p>

  <p>"Get in there," he ordered, pointing to the carriage.</p>

  <p>The young man tried to escape, but he was held as though in a vise. Before
  he well knew where he was, he was in the carriage, and Wingrave was seated by
  his side.</p>

  <p>"What do you want with me?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"I want to know what you mean by following that lady about?" Wingrave
  asked.</p>

  <p>The young man leaned forward. His hand was upon the door.</p>

  <p>"Let me get out," he said sullenly.</p>

  <p>"With pleasure&mdash;presently," Wingrave answered. "I can assure you that
  I am not anxious to detain you longer than necessary. Only you must first
  answer my question."</p>

  <p>"I want to speak to her! I shall follow her about until I can!" the young
  man declared.</p>

  <p>Wingrave glanced at him with a faint derisive smile. His clothes were worn
  and shabby, he was badly in need of a shave and a wash. He sat hunched up in
  a corner of the carriage, the picture of mute discomfort and misery.</p>

  <p>"Do you know who she is?" Wingrave asked.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle Violet!" the young man answered.</p>

  <p>"You are mistaken," Wingrave answered. "She is Lady Ruth Barrington, wife
  of Lumley Barrington and daughter of the Earl of Haselton."</p>

  <p>The young man was unmoved.</p>

  <p>"She is Mademoiselle Violet," he declared.</p>

  <p>The coupe drew up before the great block of buildings in which was
  Wingrave's flat. The footman threw open the door.</p>

  <p>"Come in with me," Wingrave said. "I have something more to say to
  you."</p>

  <p>"I would rather not," the young man muttered, and would have slouched off,
  but Wingrave caught him by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Come!" he said firmly, and the youth obeyed.</p>

  <p>Wingrave led the way into his sitting room and dismissed his servant who
  was setting out a tray upon the sideboard.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," he ordered, and his strange guest again obeyed. Wingrave
  looked at him critically.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," he said deliberately, "that you are another of those
  poor fools who chuck away their life and happiness and go to the dogs because
  a woman had chosen to make a little use of them. You're out of work, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"Hungry?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so."</p>

  <p>Wingrave brought a plate of sandwiches from the sideboard, and mixed a
  whisky and soda. He set them down in front of his guest, and turned away with
  the evening paper in his hand.</p>

  <p>"I am going into the next room for some cigarettes," he remarked.</p>

  <p>He was gone scarcely two minutes. When he returned, the room was in
  darkness. He moved suddenly towards the electric lights, but was pushed back
  by an unseen hand. A man's hot breath fell upon his cheek, a hoarse, rasping
  voice spoke to him out of the black shadows.</p>

  <p>"Don't touch the lights! Don't touch the lights, I say!"</p>

  <p>"What folly is this?" Wingrave asked angrily. "Are you mad?"</p>

  <p>"Not now," came the quick answer. "I have been. It has come to me here, in
  the darkness. I know why she is angry, I know why she will not speak to me.
  It is&mdash;because I failed."</p>

  <p>Wingrave laughed, and moved towards the lights.</p>

  <p>"We have had enough of this tomfoolery," he said scornfully. "If you won't
  listen to reason&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He never finished his sentence. He had stumbled suddenly against a soft
  body, he had a momentary impression of a white, vicious face, of eyes blazing
  with insane fury. Quick to act, he struck&mdash;but before his hand
  descended, he had felt the tearing of his shirt, the sharp, keen pain in his
  chest, the swimming of his senses. Yet even then he struck again with
  passionate anger, and his assailant went down amongst the chairs with a dull,
  sickening crash!</p>

  <p>Then there was silence in the room. Wingrave made an effort to drag
  himself a yard or two towards the bell, but collapsed hopelessly. Richardson,
  in a few moments, staggered to his feet.</p>

  <p>He groped his way to the side of the wall, and found the knobs of the
  electric lights. He turned two on and looked around him. Wingrave was lying a
  few yards off, with a small red stain upon his shirt front. His face was
  ghastly pale, and he was breathing thickly. The young man looked at him for
  several moments, and then made his way to the side table where the sandwiches
  were. One by one he took them from the dish, and ate deliberately. When he
  had finished, he made his way once more towards where Wingrave lay. But
  before he reached the spot, he stopped short. Something on the wall had
  attracted his attention. He put his hand to his head and thought for a
  moment. It was an idea&mdash;a glorious idea.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Lady Ruth's maid stepped back and surveyed her mistress ecstatically.</p>

  <p>"Milady," she declared, "has never, no never, appeared more charming. The
  gown, it is divine&mdash;and the coiffure! Milady will have no rivals."</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth looked at herself long and earnestly in the glass. Her face
  reflected none of the pleased interest with which her maid was still
  regarding her. The latter grew a little anxious.</p>

  <p>"Milady thinks herself a trifle pale, perhaps&mdash;a little more
  color?"</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth set down the glass.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you, Annette," she answered. "I shall do very well, I suppose.
  Certainly, I won't have any rouge."</p>

  <p>"Milady knows very well what becomes her," the woman answered discreetly.
  "The pallor, it is the more distinguished. Milady cannot fail to have all the
  success she desires!"</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth smiled a little wearily. And at that moment, there came a knock
  at the door. A servant entered.</p>

  <p>"Someone wishes to speak to your ladyship on the telephone," the girl
  announced.</p>

  <p>"On the telephone, at this time of night?" Lady Ruth exclaimed.
  "Ridiculous! They must send a message, whoever they are!"</p>

  <p>"Parkins told them so, your ladyship," the girl answered; "but they
  insisted that the matter was important. They would give no name, but said
  that they were speaking from Mr. Wingrave's rooms."</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"It is very extraordinary," she said coldly, "but I will come to the
  telephone."</p>

  <h2>XIV. &mdash; "IT WAS AN ACCIDENT"</h2>

  <p class="first">Lady Ruth took up the receiver. Some instinct seemed to have
  prompted her to close the door of the study.</p>

  <p>"Who is there?" she asked. "Who is it that wants me?"</p>

  <p>A thin, unfamiliar voice answered her.</p>

  <p>"Is that Lady Ruth Barrington?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"Is it&mdash;Mademoiselle Violet?"</p>

  <p>The receiver nearly dropped from her hand.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand you," she answered, "I am Lady Ruth Barrington! Who
  are you?"</p>

  <p>"You are Mademoiselle Violet," was the answer, "and you know who I am!
  Listen, I am in Mr. Wingrave's rooms."</p>

  <p>She would have liked to have rung off and gone away, but it seemed a sheer
  impossibility for her to move! And all the time her knees were shaking, and
  the fear of evil things was in her heart.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing there?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"He brought me in himself," the thin voice answered. "Can you hear me? I
  don't want to speak any louder for fear anyone else should be listening."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I can hear," she answered. "But how dared you ring me up? Say what
  you desire to quickly! I am going away."</p>

  <p>"Wait, please," the voice answered. "I know why you have been angry with
  me. I know why you have kept away from me, why you have been so cruel! It was
  because I failed. Was it not, dear Mademoiselle Violet?"</p>

  <p>She had not the breath or the courage to answer him. In a moment or two he
  continued, and there was a note of suppressed exultation in his tone.</p>

  <p>"Listen! This time&mdash;I have not failed!"</p>

  <p><a id="pic2"

    <p class="caption">"This time&mdash;I have not failed."</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>She nearly screamed. The receiver in her hand burned like a live thing.
  Her eyes were set in a fixed and awful stare as though she were trying to see
  for herself outside the walls of the little room where she stood into the
  larger chamber from which the voice&mdash;that awful voice&mdash;came! Her
  own words were hysterical and uncertain, but she managed to falter them out
  at last.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? Where is Mr. Wingrave? Tell me at once!"</p>

  <p>The voice, without being raised, seemed to take to itself a note of
  triumph.</p>

  <p>"He is dying&mdash;on the floor&mdash;just here! Listen hard! Perhaps you
  can hear him groan! Now will you believe that I am not a coward?"</p>

  <p>Her shriek drowned his words. She flung the receiver from her with a crash
  and rushed from the room into the hall. She brushed past her maid with a wild
  gesture.</p>

  <p>"Never mind my wraps. Open the door, Parkins! Is the carriage
  waiting?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Milady! Shall&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But she was past him and down the steps.</p>

  <p>"No. 18, Grosvenor Mansions," she cried to the man. "Drive fast."</p>

  <p>The man obeyed. The servants, who had come to the door, stood there a
  little frightened group. She ignored them and everything else completely. The
  carriage had scarcely stopped when she sprang out and crossed the pavement in
  a few hasty steps. The tall commissionaire looked in amazement at her. She
  wore an opera cloak&mdash;she was a bewildering vision of white satin and
  diamonds, and her eyes were terrible with the fear which was in her
  heart.</p>

  <p>She clutched him by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Come up with me to Mr. Wingrave's rooms," she exclaimed. "Something
  terrible has happened. I heard through the telephone."</p>

  <p>The man dashed up the stairs by her side. Wingrave's suite was on the
  first floor, and they did not wait for the lift. The commissionaire put his
  finger on the bell of the outside door. She leaned forward, listening
  breathlessly. Inside all was silence except for the shrill clamor of the
  bell.</p>

  <p>"Go on ringing," she said breathlessly. "Don't leave off!"</p>

  <p>The man looked at her curiously. "Mr. Wingrave came in about an hour ago
  with a young man, madam," he said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes!" she cried. "Listen! There's someone coming."</p>

  <p>They heard a hesitating step inside. The door was cautiously opened. It
  was Richardson, pale, disheveled, but triumphant, who peered out.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle&mdash;Mademoiselle Violet," he cried. "You have come to see
  for yourself. This way!"</p>

  <p>She raised her arm and struck him across the face so that, with a little
  moan, he staggered back against the wall. Then she hastened forward into the
  room towards which he had pointed and the door of which stood open. The
  commissionaire followed her. The servants were beginning to appear.</p>

  <p>The room was in darkness save for one electric light. A groan, however,
  directed them. She fell on her knees by Wingrave's prostrate figure and
  raised his head slightly. His servant, too, was hurrying forward. She looked
  up.</p>

  <p>"Get me some brandy," she ordered. "Send someone for a doctor. Don't let
  that young man escape. The brandy, quick!"</p>

  <p>She forced some between his lips. There was already a spot of blood upon
  the gown which, a few minutes ago, had seemed so immaculate. One of the
  ornaments fell from her hair. It lay unnoticed by her side. Suddenly Wingrave
  opened his eyes. She saw at once that he was conscious and that he recognized
  her.</p>

  <p>"Don't move, please," she begged. "It will be better for you not to speak.
  The doctor will be here directly."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I don't think that I am much hurt," he said slowly. "Your young friend
  was a born bungler!"</p>

  <p>She shuddered, but said nothing.</p>

  <p>"How on earth," he asked, "did you get here?"</p>

  <p>She whispered in his ear.</p>

  <p>"The brute&mdash;telephoned. Please don't talk."</p>

  <p>The doctor arrived. His examination was over in a few moments.</p>

  <p>"Nothing serious," he declared. "The knife was pretty blunt fortunately.
  How did it happen? It seems like a case for the police."</p>

  <p>"It was an accident," Wingrave declared coolly.</p>

  <p>The doctor shrugged his shoulders. He was busy making bandages. Lady Ruth
  rose to her feet. She was white and giddy. The commissionaire and Morrison
  were talking together at the door. The latter turned to Lady Ruth.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that we had better send for the police, your ladyship?" he
  asked. "It was the young man who came in with Mr. Wingrave who must have done
  this! I thought he was a very wild-looking sort of person."</p>

  <p>"You heard what Mr. Wingrave said," she answered. "I don't think that I
  should disobey him, if I were you. The doctor says that, after all, it is not
  very serious."</p>

  <p>"He can't have got far," the hall porter remarked. "He only slipped out as
  we came in."</p>

  <p>"I should let him go for the present," Lady Ruth said. "If Mr. Wingrave
  wishes to prosecute afterwards, it will be easy for him to do so."</p>

  <p>She stepped back to where Wingrave lay. He was in a recumbent position now
  and, although a little pale, he was obviously not seriously hurt.</p>

  <p>"If there is nothing else that I can do," she said, "I will go now!"</p>

  <p>"By all means," Wingrave answered. "I am exceedingly obliged to you for
  your kindness," he added a little stiffly. "Morrison, show Lady Barrington to
  her carriage!"</p>

  <p>She spoke a few conventional words of farewell and departed. Outside on
  the pavement she stood for a moment, looking carefully around. There was no
  sign of Richardson anywhere! She stepped into the carriage and leaned back in
  the corner.</p>

  <h2>XV. &mdash; AYNESWORTH PLANS A LOVE STORY</h2>

  <p class="first">Wingrave disappeared suddenly from London. Aynesworth alone
  knew where he was gone, and he was pledged to secrecy. Two people received
  letters from him. Lady Ruth was one of them.</p>

  <p>"This," she remarked quietly, handing it over to her husband, "may
  interest you."</p>

  <p>He adjusted his eye glasses and read it aloud:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Dear Lady Ruth,&mdash;I am leaving London today for several weeks. With
  the usual inconsistency of the person to whom life is by no means a valuable
  asset, I am obeying the orders of my physician. I regret, therefore, that I
  cannot have the pleasure of entertaining your husband and yourself during
  Cowes week. The yacht, however, is entirely at your disposal, and I have
  written Captain Masterton to that effect. Pray extend your cruise, if you
  feel inclined to.&mdash;I remain, yours sincerely, W."</p>

  <p>Mr. Barrington looked at his wife inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"That seems to me entirely satisfactory, Ruth," he said. "I think that he
  might have added a word or two of acknowledgment for what you did for him.
  There is no doubt that, but for your promptness, things might have gone much
  worse."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Lady Ruth said slowly, "I think that he might have added a few
  words."</p>

  <p>Her husband regarded her critically.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, dear," he said, "that all this anxiety has knocked you up a
  little. You are not looking well."</p>

  <p>"I am tired," she answered calmly. "It has been a long season. I should
  like to do what Wingrave has done&mdash;go away somewhere and rest."</p>

  <p>Barrington laid his hand upon hers affectionately. It seemed to him that
  the rings hung a little loosely upon the thin, white fingers. She was pale,
  too, and her eyes were weary. He did not notice that, as soon as she could,
  she drew her hand away.</p>

  <p>"Pon my word," he said, "I wish we could go off somewhere by ourselves.
  But with Wingrave's yacht to entertain on, we must do something for a few of
  the people. I don't suppose he minds whom we ask, or how many."</p>

  <p>"No!" she answered, "I do not suppose he cares."</p>

  <p>"It is most opportune," Barrington declared. "I wanted particularly to do
  something for the Hendersons. He seems very well disposed, and his influence
  means everything just now. Really, Ruth, I believe we are going to pull
  through after all."</p>

  <p>She smiled a little wearily.</p>

  <p>"Do you think so, Lumley?"</p>

  <p>"I am sure of it, Ruth," he answered. "I only wish I could see you a
  little more cheerful. Surely you can't still&mdash;be afraid of Wingrave," he
  added, glancing uneasily across the table.</p>

  <p>She looked him in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I am," she answered. "I am afraid of him. I have
  always been afraid. Nothing has happened to change him. He came back to have
  his revenge. He will have it."</p>

  <p>Lumley Barrington, for once, felt himself superior to his clever wife. He
  smiled upon her reassuringly.</p>

  <p>"My dear Ruth," he said, "if only you would reflect for a few moments, I
  feel sure you would realize the absurdity of such fancies. We did Wingrave a
  service in introducing him to society here, and I am sure that he appreciated
  it. If he wished for our ruin, why did he lend us eight thousand pounds on no
  security? Why does he lend us his yacht to entertain our friends? Why did he
  give me that information which enabled me to make the only money I ever did
  make on the Stock Exchange?"</p>

  <p>She smiled contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"You do not understand a man like Wingrave," she declared. "Nothing that
  he has done is inconsistent with my point of view. He gave you a safe tip,
  knowing very well that when you had won a little, you would try again on your
  own account and lose&mdash;which you did. He lent us the money to become our
  creditor; and he lends us the yacht to give another handle to the people who
  are saying already that he occupies the position in our family which is more
  fully recognized on the other side of the Channel!"</p>

  <p>"You are talking rubbish," he declared vehemently. "No one would dare to
  say such a thing of you&mdash;of my wife!"</p>

  <p>She laughed unmercifully.</p>

  <p>"If you were not my husband," she said cruelly, "you would have heard it
  before now. I have been careful all my life&mdash;more careful than most
  women, but I can hear the whisperings already. There are more ways to ruin
  than one, Lumley."</p>

  <p>"We will refuse the yacht," Barrington said sullenly, "and I will go to
  the Jews for that eight thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"We will do nothing of the sort," Lady Ruth answered. "I am not going to
  be a laughing stock for Emily and her friends if I can help it. We'll play
  the game through now! Only&mdash;it is best for you to know the risks..."</p>

  <p>Wingrave's second letter was to Juliet. She found it on her table one
  afternoon when she came back from her painting class. She tore it open
  eagerly enough, but her face clouded over as she read.</p>

  <p>"Dear Juliet,&mdash;I am sorry that I am unable to carry out my promise to
  come and see you, but I have been slightly indisposed for some days, and am
  leaving London, for the present, almost at once. I trust that you are still
  interested in your work, and will enjoy your trip to Normandy.</p>

  <p>"I received your letter, asking for my help towards re-establishing in
  life a poor family in whom you are interested. I regret that I cannot accede
  to your request. It is wholly against my principles to give money away to
  people of this class. I look upon all charity as a mischievous attempt to
  tamper with natural laws, and I am convinced that if everyone shared my
  views, society would long ago have been re-established on a sounder and more
  logical basis. To be quite frank with you, also, I might add that the gift of
  sympathy has been denied to me. I am quite indifferent whether the family you
  allude to starve or prosper.</p>

  <p>"So far as you yourself are concerned, however, the matter is entirely
  different. If it gives you pleasure to assist in pauperizing any number of
  your fellow creatures, pray do so. I enclose a check for L100. It is a
  present to you. Use it entirely as you please&mdash;only, if you use it for
  the purpose suggested in your letter to me, remember that the responsibility
  is yours, and yours alone.&mdash;I remain, sincerely yours, Wingrave
  Seton."</p>

  <p>Juliet walked straight to her writing table. Her cheeks were flushed, and
  her eyes were wet with tears. She drew out a sheet of note paper and wrote
  rapidly:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"My dear guardian,&mdash;I return you the check. I cannot accept such
  presents after all your goodness to me. I am sorry that you feel as you do
  about giving money away. You are so much older and wiser than I am that I
  dare not attempt to argue with you. Only it seems to me that life would be a
  cruelly selfish thing if we who are so much more fortunate than many of our
  fellow creatures did not sometimes try to help them a little through their
  misery. Perhaps I feel this a little more keenly because I wonder sometimes
  what might not have become of me but for your goodness.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry that you are going away without coming to see me again. You
  are not displeased with me, I hope, for asking you this, or for any other
  reason? I am foolish enough to feel a little lonely sometimes. Will you take
  me out again when you come back?&mdash;Your affectionate ward, Juliet."</p>

  <p>Juliet went out and posted her letter. On the way back she met
  Aynesworth.</p>

  <p>"Come and sit in the Park for a few minutes," he begged.</p>

  <p>She turned and walked by his side willingly enough.</p>

  <p>"Have you been in to see me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" he answered. "I have some tickets for the Haymarket for tonight. Do
  you think we could persuade Mrs. Tresfarwin to come?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure we could," she answered, laughing. "Hannah never wants any
  persuading. How nice of you to think of us!"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he answered, "that I think of you a good deal."</p>

  <p>"Then I think that that also is very nice of you!" she declared.</p>

  <p>"You like to be thought of?"</p>

  <p>"Who doesn't? What is the play tonight?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you about it afterwards," he said. "There is something else I
  want to say to you first."</p>

  <p>She nodded. She scarcely showed so much interest as he would have
  liked.</p>

  <p>"It is about Berneval," he said, keeping his eyes fixed upon her face. "I
  saw Mr. Pleydell today, and he told me that you were all going there. He
  suggested that I should come too!"</p>

  <p>"How delightful!" she exclaimed. "Can you really get off?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Sir Wingrave is going away, and doesn't want me. I must go
  somewhere, and I thought that I might go over and take rooms near you all.
  Would you care to have me?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I would," she answered frankly. "Oh!" she exclaimed suddenly,
  her face clouding over&mdash;"I forgot!"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," she said, "that I am going."</p>

  <p>"Not going?" he repeated incredulously. "Mr. Pleydell told me that it was
  all arranged."</p>

  <p>"It was&mdash;until today," she said. "I am a little uncertain now."</p>

  <p>He looked at her perplexed.</p>

  <p>"May I know why?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She raised her eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>"You are rather an inquisitive person," she remarked. "The fact is, I may
  need the money I have saved for Berneval for somewhere else."</p>

  <p>"Of course," he said slowly, "if you don't go&mdash;I don't. But you can't
  stay in London all through the hot weather!"</p>

  <p>"Miss Pengarth has asked me to go down there," she said.</p>

  <p>He laid his hand suddenly upon hers.</p>

  <p>"Juliet," he said.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Miss Lundy, please!"</p>

  <p>"Well, Miss Lundy then! May I talk to you seriously?"</p>

  <p>"I prefer you frivolous," she murmured. "I like to be amused."</p>

  <p>"I'll be frivolous enough later on this evening. I've been wondering if
  you'd think it impertinent if I asked you to tell me about your
  guardian."</p>

  <p>"What do you want to know?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Just who he is, and why he is content to let you live with only an old
  woman to look after you. It isn't the best thing in the world for you, is it?
  I should like to know him, Juliet."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," she said, "I cannot tell you anything."</p>

  <p>There was a short silence. Aynesworth was disappointed, and showed it.</p>

  <p>"It isn't exactly ordinary curiosity," he continued. "Don't think that!
  Only I feel that you need someone who has the right to advise you and look
  after you. I should like to be your guardian, Juliet!"</p>

  <p>She laughed merrily.</p>

  <p>"Good!" she declared. "I like you so much better frivolous. Well, you
  shall have your wish. You shall be my guardian for the evening. I have one
  cutlet for dinner, and I am sure it will be spoilt. Will you come and share
  it?"</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet and stood looking down upon him. He was struck, for
  the first time, by something different in her appearance. The smooth,
  delicate girlishness of her young face was, as yet, untroubled. Her eyes
  laughed frankly into his, and all the grace of natural childhood seemed still
  to linger about her. And yet&mdash;there was a change! Understanding was
  there; understanding, with sorrow in its wake. Aynesworth was suddenly
  anxious. Had anything happened of which he was ignorant? He rose up slowly.
  He was sure of himself now! Was he sure of her?</p>

  <h2>XVI. &mdash; A DEED OF GIFT</h2>

  <p class="first">Wingrave threw the paper aside with an impatient
  exclamation. A small notice in an obscure corner had attracted his attention;
  the young man, Richardson, had been fished out of the river half drowned, and
  in view of his tearful and abject penitence, had been allowed to go his way
  by a lenient magistrate. He had been ill, he pleaded, and disappointed. His
  former employer, in an Islington emporium, gave him a good character, and
  offered to take him back. So that was an end of Mr. Richardson, and the
  romance of his days!</p>

  <p>A worm like that to have brought him&mdash;the strong man, low! Wingrave
  thought with sullen anger as he leaned back in his chair with half-closed
  eyes. Here was an undignified hiatus, if not a finale, to all his schemes, to
  the even tenor of his self-restrained, purposeful life! The west wind was
  rippling through the orchards which bordered the garden. The muffled roar of
  the Atlantic was in his ears, a strange everlasting background to all the
  slighter summer sounds, the murmuring of insects, the calling of birds, the
  melodious swish of the whirling knives in the distant hayfield. Wingrave was
  alone with his thoughts, and he hated them!</p>

  <p>Even Mr. Pengarth was welcome, Mr. Pengarth very warm from his ride,
  carrying his hat and a small black bag in his hand. As he drew nearer, he
  became hotter and was obliged to rest his bag upon the path and mop his
  forehead. He was more afraid of his client than of anything else in the
  world.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon, Sir Wingrave," he said. "I trust that you are feeling
  better today."</p>

  <p>Wingrave eyed him coldly. He did not reply to the inquiry as to his
  health.</p>

  <p>"You have brought the deed?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Sir Wingrave."</p>

  <p>The lawyer produced a roll of parchment from his bag. In response to
  Wingrave's gesture, he seated himself on the extreme edge of an adjacent
  seat.</p>

  <p>"I do not propose to read all that stuff through," Wingrave remarked. "I
  take it for granted that the deed is made out according to my
  instructions."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Sir Wingrave!"</p>

  <p>"Then we will go into the house, and I will sign it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pengarth mopped his forehead once more. It was a terrible thing to
  have a conscience.</p>

  <p>"Sir Wingrave," he said, "I apologize most humbly for what I am about to
  say, but as the agent of your estates in this county and
  your&mdash;er&mdash;legal adviser with regard to them, I am forced to ask you
  whether you are quite determined upon this&mdash;most unexampled piece of
  generosity. Tredowen has been in your mother's family for a great many years,
  and although I must say that I have a great affection for this young lady, I
  have also an old fashioned dislike to seeing&mdash;er&mdash;family property
  pass into the hands of strangers. You might, forgive me&mdash;marry!"</p>

  <p>Wingrave smiled very faintly, otherwise his face was inscrutable.</p>

  <p>"I might," he admitted calmly, "but I shall not. Do you consider me, Mr.
  Pengarth, to be a person in possession of his usual faculties?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, most certainly&mdash;most certainly," the lawyer declared
  emphatically.</p>

  <p>"Then please do not question my instructions any further. So far as
  regards the pecuniary part of it, I am a richer man than you have any idea
  of, Mr. Pengarth, and for the rest&mdash;sentiment unfortunately does not
  appeal to me. I choose to give the Tredowen estates away, to disappoint my
  next of kin. That is how you may regard the transaction. We will go into the
  house and complete this deed."</p>

  <p>Wingrave rose slowly and walked with some difficulty up the gravel path.
  He ignored, however, his companion's timid offer of help, and led the way to
  the library. In a few minutes the document was signed and witnessed.</p>

  <p>"I have ordered tea in the garden," Wingrave said, as the two servants
  left the room; "that is, unless you prefer any other sort of refreshment. I
  don't know much about the cellars, but there is some cabinet hock, I
  believe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Pengarth interposed.</p>

  <p>"I am very much obliged," he said, "but I will not intrude upon you
  further. If you will allow me, I will ring the bell for my trap."</p>

  <p>"You will do nothing of the sort," Wingrave answered testily. "You will
  stay here and talk to me."</p>

  <p>"I will stay with pleasure if you desire it," the lawyer answered. "I had
  an idea that you preferred solitude."</p>

  <p>"Then you were wrong," Wingrave answered. "I hate being alone."</p>

  <p>They moved out together towards the garden. Tea was set out in a shady
  corner of the lawn.</p>

  <p>"If you will forgive my remarking it," Mr. Pengarth said, "this seems
  rather an extraordinary place for you to come to if you really dislike
  solitude."</p>

  <p>"I come to escape from an intolerable situation, and because I was ill,"
  Wingrave said.</p>

  <p>"You might have brought friends," the lawyer suggested.</p>

  <p>"I have no friends," Wingrave answered.</p>

  <p>"Some of the people in the neighborhood would be very glad&mdash;" Mr.
  Pengarth began.</p>

  <p>"I do not wish to see them," Wingrave answered.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pengarth took a peach, and held his tongue. Wingrave broke the silence
  which followed a little abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Mr. Pengarth," he said, "do I look like a man likely to fail in
  anything he sets out to accomplish?"</p>

  <p>The lawyer shook his head vigorously.</p>

  <p>"You do not," he declared.</p>

  <p>"Nor do I feel like one," Wingrave said, "and yet my record since I
  commenced, shall I call it my second life, is one of complete failure!
  Nothing that I planned have I been able to accomplish. I look back through
  the months and through the years, and I see not a single purpose carried out,
  not a single scheme successful.</p>

  <p>"Not quite so bad as that, I trust, Sir Wingrave," the lawyer
  protested.</p>

  <p>"It is the precise truth," Wingrave affirmed drily. "I am losing
  confidence in myself."</p>

  <p>"At least," the lawyer declared, "you have been the salvation of our dear
  Miss Juliet, if I may call her so. But for you, her life would have been
  ruined."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Wingrave agreed. "But I forgot! You don't understand! I have
  saved her from heaven knows what! I am going to give her the home she loves!
  Benevolence, isn't it? And yet, if I had only the pluck, I might succeed even
  now&mdash;so far as she is concerned."</p>

  <p>The lawyer took off his spectacles and rubbed them with his handkerchief.
  He was thoroughly bewildered.</p>

  <p>"I might succeed," Wingrave repeated, leaning back in his chair, "if
  only&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His face darkened. It seemed to Mr. Pengarth as he sipped his tea under
  the cool cedars, drawing in all their wonderful perfume with every puff of
  breeze, that he saw two men in the low invalid's chair before him. He saw the
  breath and desire of evil things struggling with some wonderful dream vainly
  seeking to realize itself.</p>

  <p>"Some of us," the lawyer said timidly, "build our ideals too high up in
  the clouds, so that to reach them is very difficult. Nevertheless, the effort
  counts."</p>

  <p>Wingrave laughed mockingly.</p>

  <p>"It is not like that with me," he declared. "My plans were made down in
  hell."</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul!" the lawyer murmured. "But you are not serious, Sir
  Wingrave?"</p>

  <p>"Ay! I'm serious enough," Wingrave answered. "Do you suppose a man, with
  the best pages of his life rooted out, is likely to look out upon his fellows
  from the point of view of a philanthropist? Do you suppose that the man, into
  whose soul the irons of bitterness have gnawed and eaten their way, is likely
  to come out with a smirk and look around him for the opportunity of doing
  good? Rubbish! My aim is to encourage suffering wherever I see it, to create
  it where I can, to make sinners and thieves of honest people."</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul!" the lawyer gasped again. "I don't think you can
  be&mdash;as bad as you think you are. What about Juliet Lundy?"</p>

  <p>Fire flashed in Wingrave's eyes. Again, at the mention of her name, he
  seemed almost to lose control of himself. It was several moments before he
  spoke. He looked Mr. Pengarth in the face, and his tone was unusually
  deliberate.</p>

  <p>"Gifts," he said, "are not always given in friendship. Life may easily
  become a more complicated affair for that child with the Tredowen estates
  hanging round her neck. And anyhow, I disappoint my next of kin."</p>

  <p>Morrison, smooth-footed and silent, appeared upon the lawn. He addressed
  Wingrave.</p>

  <p>"A lady has arrived in a cab from Truro, sir," he announced. "She wishes
  to see you as soon as convenient."</p>

  <p>A sudden light flashed across Wingrave's face, dying out again almost
  immediately.</p>

  <p>"Who is she, Morrison?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The man glanced at Mr. Pengarth.</p>

  <p>"She did not give her name, sir."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pengarth and Wingrave both rose. The former at once made his adieux
  and took a short cut to the stables. Wingrave, who leaned heavily upon his
  stick, clutched Morrison by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Who is it, Morrison?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"It is Lady Ruth Barrington, sir," the man answered.</p>

  <p>"Alone?"</p>

  <p>"Quite alone, sir."</p>

  <h2>XVII. &mdash; FOR PITY'S SAKE</h2>

  <p class="first">The library at Tredowen was a room of irregular shape, full
  of angles and recesses lined with bookcases. It was in one of these, standing
  motionless before a small marble statue of some forgotten Greek poet, that
  Wingrave found his visitor. She wore a plain serge traveling dress, and the
  pallor of her face, from which she had just lifted a voluminous veil, matched
  almost in color the gleaming white marble upon which she was gazing. But when
  she saw Wingrave, leaning upon his stick, and regarding her with stern
  surprise, strange lights seemed to flash in her eyes. There was no longer any
  resemblance between the pallor of her cheeks and the pallor of the
  statue.</p>

  <p>"Lady Ruth," Wingrave said quietly, "I do not understand what has procured
  for me the pleasure of this unexpected visit."</p>

  <p>She swayed a little towards him. Her head was thrown back, all the silent
  passion of the inexpressible, the hidden secondary forces of nature, was
  blazing out of her eyes, pleading with him in the broken music of her
  tone.</p>

  <p>"You do not understand," she repeated. "Ah, no! But can I make you
  understand? Will you listen to me for once as a human being? Will you
  remember that you are a man, and I a woman pleading for a little
  mercy&mdash;a little kindness?"</p>

  <p>Wingrave moved a step further back.</p>

  <p>"Permit me," he said, "to offer you a chair."</p>

  <p>She sank into it&mdash;speechless for a moment. Wingrave stood over her,
  leaning slightly against the corner of the bookcase.</p>

  <p>"I trust," he said, "that you will explain what all this means. If it is
  my help which you require&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her hands flashed out towards him&mdash;a gesture almost of horror.</p>

  <p>"Don't," she begged, "you know that it is not that! You know very well
  that it is not. Why do you torture me?"</p>

  <p>"I can only ask you," he said, "to explain."</p>

  <p>She commenced talking quickly. Her sentences came in little gasps.</p>

  <p>"You wanted revenge&mdash;not in the ordinary way. You had brooded over it
  too long. You understood too well. Once it was I who sought to revenge myself
  on you because you would not listen to me! You hurt my pride. Everything that
  was evil in me rebelled&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is this necessary?" he interrupted coldly. "I have never reproached you.
  You chose the path of safety for yourself. Many another woman in your place
  would doubtless have done the same thing! What I desire to know is why you
  are here in Cornwall. What has happened to make this journey seem necessary
  to you?"</p>

  <p>"Listen!" she continued. "I want you to know how thoroughly you have
  succeeded. Before you came, Lumley and I were living together decently
  enough, and, as hundreds of others live, with outside interests for our chief
  distraction. You came, a friend! You were very subtle, very skillful! You
  never spoke a word of affection to me, but you managed things so
  that&mdash;people talked. You encouraged Lumley to speculate&mdash;not in
  actual words, perhaps, but by suggestion. Then you lent me money. Lumley, my
  husband, let me borrow from you. Everyone knew that we were ruined; everyone
  knew where the money came from that set us right. So misery has been piled
  upon misery. Lumley has lost his self respect, he is losing his ambition, he
  is deteriorating every day. I&mdash;how can I do anything else but despise
  him? He let me, his wife, come to your rooms to borrow money from you. Do you
  think I can ever forget that? Do you think that he can? Don't you know that
  the memory of it is dragging us apart, must keep us apart
  always&mdash;always?"</p>

  <p>Wingrave leaned a little forward. His hands were clasped upon the handle
  of his stick.</p>

  <p>"All that you tell me," he remarked coldly, "might equally well have been
  said in London! I do not wish to seem inhospitable, but I am still waiting to
  know why you have taken an eight hours' journey to recite a few fairly
  obvious truths. Your relations with your husband, frankly, do not interest
  me. The deductions which society may have drawn concerning our friendship
  need scarcely trouble you, under the circumstances."</p>

  <p>Then again the light was blazing in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Under the circumstances!" she repeated. "I know what you mean. It is true
  that you have asked for nothing. It is true that all this time you have never
  spoken a single word which all the world might not hear, you have never even
  touched my fingers, except as a matter of formality. Once I was the woman you
  loved&mdash;and I&mdash;well you know! Is this part of your scheme of
  torture, to play with me as though we were marionettes, you and I, with
  sawdust in our veins, dull, lifeless puppets! Well, it is finished&mdash;your
  vengeance! You may reap the harvest when you will! Publish my letters, prove
  yourself an injured man. Take a whip in your hand if you like, and I will
  never flinch. But, for heaven's sake, remember that I am a woman! I am
  willing to be your slave, nurse you, wait upon you, follow you about! What
  more can your vengeance need? You have made me despise my husband, you have
  made me hate my life with him! You have forced me into a remembrance of what
  I have never really forgotten&mdash;and oh! Wingrave," she added, opening her
  arms to him with a little sob, "if you send me away, I think that I shall
  kill myself. Wingrave!"</p>

  <p>There was a note of despair in her last cry. Her arms fell to her side.
  Wingrave was on his way to the further end of the room. He rang the bell and
  turned towards her.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he said calmly, "you will return to London tonight. If ever I
  require you, I shall send for you&mdash;and you will come. At present I do
  not. You will return to your husband. Understand!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she gasped, "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He held out his hand. Morrison was at the door.</p>

  <p>"Morrison," he said, "you will order the motor to be round in half an hour
  to take Lady Ruth to Truro, She has to catch the London express. You will go
  with her yourself, and see that she has a reserved carriage. If, by any
  chance, you should miss the train, order a special."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir."</p>

  <p>"And tell the cook to send in tea and wine, and some sandwiches, in ten
  minutes."</p>

  <p>Once more they were alone. Lady Ruth rose slowly to her feet and,
  trembling in every limb, she walked down the room and fell on her knees
  before Wingrave.</p>

  <p>"Wingrave," she said, "I will go away. I will do all that you tell me; I
  will wear my chains bravely, and hold my peace. But before I go, for heaven's
  sake, say a kind word, look at me kindly, kiss me, hold my hands; anything,
  anything, anything to prove to me that you are not a dead man. I could bear
  unkindness, reproaches, abuse. I can bear anything but this deadly coldness.
  It is becoming a horror to me! Do, Wingrave&mdash;do!"</p>

    <p class="caption">"Before I go, for heaven's sake say a kind word."</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>She clasped his hand&mdash;he drew it calmly away.</p>

  <p>"Lady Ruth," he said, "you have spoken the truth. I am a dead man. I have
  no affections; I care neither for you nor for any living being. All that goes
  to the glory and joy of life perished in that uncountable roll of days, when
  the sun went out, and inch by inch the wall rose which will divide me forever
  from you and all the world. Frankly, it was not I who once loved you. It was
  the man who died in prison. His flesh and bones may have
  survived&mdash;nothing else!"</p>

  <p>She rose slowly to her feet. Her eyes seemed to be dilating.</p>

  <p>"There is another woman!" she exclaimed softly. Her voice was like velvet,
  but the agony in her face was unmistakable.</p>

  <p>"There is no other woman," he answered.</p>

  <p>She stood quite still.</p>

  <p>"She is here with you now," she cried. "Who is it, Wingrave? Tell me the
  truth!"</p>

  <p>"The truth is already told," he answered. "Except my cook and her
  assistants, there is not a woman in the house!"</p>

  <p>Again she listened. She gave a little hoarse cry, and Wingrave started.
  Out in the hall a girl's clear laugh rang like a note of music to their
  ears.</p>

  <p>"You lie!" she cried fiercely. "You lie! I will know who she is."</p>

  <p>Suddenly the door was thrown open! Juliet stood there, her hands full of
  roses, her face flushed and brilliant with smiles.</p>

  <p>"How delightful to find you here!" she exclaimed, coming swiftly across to
  Wingrave. "I do hope you won't mind my coming. Normandy is off, and I have
  nowhere else to go."</p>

  <p>She saw Lady Ruth and stopped.</p>

  <p>"Oh! I beg your pardon!" she exclaimed. "I did not know."</p>

  <p>"This is Lady Ruth Barrington," Wingrave said; "my ward, Miss Juliet
  Lundy."</p>

  <p>"Your&mdash;ward?" Lady Ruth said, gazing at her intently.</p>

  <p>Juliet nodded.</p>

  <p>"Sir Wingrave has been very kind to me since I was a child," she said
  softly. "He has let me live here with Mrs. Tresfarwin, and I am afraid I
  sometimes forget that it is not really my home. Am I in the way?" she asked,
  looking wistfully towards Wingrave.</p>

  <p>"By no means!" he exclaimed. "Lady Ruth is just going. Will you see that
  she has some tea or something?"</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth laughed quietly.</p>

  <p>"I think," she said, "that it is I who am in the way! I should love some
  tea, if there is time, but whatever happens, I must not miss that train."</p>

  <h2>XVIII. &mdash; A DREAM OF PARADISE</h2>

  <p class="first">It seemed to Wingrave that the days which followed formed a
  sort of hiatus in his life&mdash;an interlude during which some other man in
  his place, and in his image, played the game of life to a long-forgotten
  tune. He moved through the hours as a man in a maze, unrecognizable to
  himself, half unconscious, half heedless of the fact that the garments of his
  carefully cultivated antagonism to the world and to his fellows had slipped
  very easily from his unresisting shoulders. The glory of a perfect English
  midsummer lay like a golden spell upon the land. The moors were purple with
  heather, touched here and there with the fire of the flaming gorse, the wind
  blew always from the west, the gardens were ablaze with slowly bursting
  rhododendrons. Every gleam of coloring, every breath of perfume, seemed to
  carry him unresistingly back to the days of his boyhood. He fished once more
  in the trout streams; he threw away his stick, and tramped or rode with
  Juliet across the moors. At night time she sang or played with the windows
  open, Wingrave himself out of sight under the cedar trees, whose perfume
  filled with aromatic sweetness the still night air. Piles of letters came
  every day, which he left unopened upon his study table. Telegrams followed,
  which he threw into the wastepaper basket. Juliet watched the accumulating
  heap with amazement.</p>

  <p>"Whatever do people write to you so much for?" she asked one morning,
  watching the stream of letters flow out of the post bag.</p>

  <p>Wingrave was silent for a moment. Her question brought a sudden and sharp
  sting of remembrance. Juliet knew him only as Sir Wingrave Seton. She knew
  nothing of Mr. Wingrave, millionaire.</p>

  <p>"Advertisements, a good many of them," he said. "I must send for
  Aynesworth some day to go through them all."</p>

  <p>"What fun!" she exclaimed. "Do send for him! He thinks that I am staying
  with Miss Pengarth, and I haven't written once since I got here!"</p>

  <p>To Wingrave, it seemed that a chill had somehow stolen into the hot summer
  morning. His feet were very nearly upon the earth again.</p>

  <p>"I forgot," he said, "that Aynesworth was&mdash;a friend of yours. He came
  and saw you often in London?"</p>

  <p>She smiled reflectively.</p>

  <p>"He has been very, very kind," she answered. "He was always that, from the
  first time I saw you both. Do you remember? It was down in the lower
  gardens."</p>

  <p>"Yes!" he answered, "I remember quite well."</p>

  <p>"He was very kind to me then," she continued, "and you&mdash;well, I was
  frightened of you." She stopped for a moment and laughed. Her eyes were full
  of amazed reminiscence. "You were so cold and severe! I never could have
  dreamed that, after all, it was you who were going to be the dearest, most
  generous friend I could ever have had! Do you know, Walter&mdash;I mean Mr.
  Aynesworth&mdash;isn't very pleased with me just now?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"He cannot understand why I will not tell him my guardian's name. I think
  it worries him."</p>

  <p>"You would like to tell him?" Wingrave asked.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I think so," she answered.</p>

  <p>Wingrave said no more, but after breakfast he went to his study alone.
  Juliet found him there an hour later, sitting idly in front of his table. His
  great pile of correspondence was still untouched. She came and sat on the
  edge of the table.</p>

  <p>"What are we going to do this morning, please?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Wingrave glanced towards his letters.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, "that I must spend the day here!"</p>

  <p>She looked at him blankly.</p>

  <p>"Not really!" she exclaimed. "I thought that we were going to walk to
  Hanging Tor?"</p>

  <p>Wingrave took up a handful of letters and let them fall through his
  fingers. He had all the sensations of a man who is awakened from a dream of
  Paradise to face the dull tortures of a dreary and eventless life. His eyes
  were set in a fixed state. An undernote of despair was in his tone.</p>

  <p>"You know we arranged it yesterday," she continued eagerly, "and if you
  are going to send for Mr. Aynesworth, you needn't bother about these letters
  yourself, need you?"</p>

  <p>He turned and regarded her deliberately. Her forehead was wrinkled a
  little with disappointment, her brown eyes were filled with the soft light of
  confident appeal. Tall and elegantly slim, there was yet something in the
  graceful lines of her figure which reminded him forcibly that the days of her
  womanhood had indeed arrived.</p>

  <p>She wore a plain white cambric dress and a simple, but much beflowered
  hat; the smaller details of her toilet all indicated the correct taste and
  instinctive coquetry of her French descent. And she was beautiful! Wingrave
  regarded her critically and realized, perhaps for the first time, how
  beautiful. Her eyes were large and clear, and her eyebrows delicately
  defined. Her mouth, with its slightly humorous curl, was a little large, but
  wholly delightful. The sun of the last few weeks had given to her skin a
  faint, but most becoming, duskiness. Under his close scrutiny, a flush of
  color stole into her cheeks. She laughed not altogether naturally.</p>

  <p>"You look at me," she said, "as though I were someone strange!"</p>

  <p>"I was looking," he answered, "for the child, the little black-frocked
  child, you know, with the hair down her back, and the tearful eyes. I don't
  think I realized that she had vanished so completely."</p>

  <p>"Not more completely," she declared gaily, "than the gloomy gentleman who
  frowned upon my existence and resented even my gratitude. Although," she
  added, leaning a little towards him, "I am very much afraid that I see some
  signs of a relapse today. Don't bother about those horrid letters. Let me
  tell Mrs. Tresfarwin to pack us up some lunch, and take me to Hanging Tor,
  please!"</p>

  <p>Wingrave laughed a little unsteadily as he rose to his feet. One day more,
  then! Why not? The end would be soon enough!...</p>

  <p>Sooner, perhaps, than even he imagined, for that night Aynesworth came,
  pale and travel-stained, with all the volcanic evidences of a great passion
  blazing in his eyes, quivering in his tone. The day had passed to Wingrave as
  a dream, more beautiful even than any in the roll of its predecessors. They
  sat together on low chairs upon the moonlit lawn, in their ears the murmur of
  the sea; upon their faces, gathering strength with the darkness, the night
  wind, salt and fragrant with all the sweetness of dying flowers. Wingrave had
  never realized more completely what still seemed to him this wonderful gap in
  his life. Behind it all, he had a subconsciousness that he was but taking a
  part in some mystical play; yet with an abandon which, when he stopped to
  think of it, astonished him, he gave himself up without effort or scruple to
  this most amazing interlude. All day he had talked more than ever before; the
  flush on his cheeks was like the flush of wine or the sun which had fired his
  blood. As he had talked the more, so had she grown the more silent. She was
  sitting now with her hands clasped and her head thrown back, looking up at
  the stars with unseeing eyes.</p>

  <p>"You do not regret Normandy, then?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No!" she murmured. "I have been happy here. I have been happier than I
  could ever have been in Normandy."</p>

  <p>He turned and looked at her with curious intentness.</p>

  <p>"My experience," he said thoughtfully, "of young ladies of your age is
  somewhat limited. But I should have thought that you would have found
  it&mdash;lonely."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am different, then," she murmured. "I have never been lonely
  here&mdash;all my life!"</p>

  <p>"Except," he reminded her, "when I knew you first."</p>

  <p>"Ah! But that was different," she protested. "I had no home in those days,
  and I was afraid of being sent away."</p>

  <p>It was in his mind then to tell her of the envelope with her name upon it
  in his study, but a sudden rush of confusing thoughts kept him silent. It was
  while he was laboring in the web of this tangled dream of wild but beautiful
  emotions that Aynesworth came. A pale, tragic figure in his travel-stained
  clothes, and face furrowed with anxiety, he stood over them almost before
  they were aware of his presence.</p>

  <p>"Walter!" she cried, and sprang to her feet with extended hands.
  Wingrave's face darkened, and the shadow of evil crept into his suddenly
  altered expression. It was an abrupt awakening this, and he hated the man who
  had brought it about.</p>

  <p>Aynesworth held the girl's hands for a moment, but his manner was
  sufficient evidence of the spirit in which he had come. He drew a little
  breath, and he looked from one to the other anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Is this&mdash;your mysterious guardian, Juliet?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

  <p>She glanced at Wingrave questioningly. His expression was ominous, and the
  light faded from her own face. While she hesitated, Wingrave spoke.</p>

  <p>"I imagine," he said, "that the fact is fairly obvious. What have you to
  say about it?"</p>

  <p>"A good deal," Aynesworth answered passionately. "Juliet, please go away.
  I must speak to your guardian&mdash;alone!"</p>

  <p>Again she looked at Wingrave. He pointed to the house.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "that you had better go."</p>

  <p>She hesitated. Something of the impending storm was already manifest.
  Aynesworth turned suddenly towards her.</p>

  <p>"You shall not enter that house again, Juliet," he declared. "Stay in the
  gardens there, and presently you shall know why."</p>
  <hr>

     id="ch2-19"><!--Chapter Anchor--></a></p>

  <h2>XIX. &mdash; THE AWAKENING</h2>

  <p class="first">Wingrave had risen to his feet. He was perfectly calm, but
  there was a look on his face which Juliet had never seen there before.
  Instinctively she drew a little away, and Aynesworth took his place between
  them.</p>

  <p>"Are you mad, Aynesworth?" Wingrave asked coolly.</p>

  <p>"Not now," Aynesworth answered. "I have been mad to stay with you for four
  years, to look on, however passively, at all the evil you have done. I've had
  enough of it now, and of you! I came here to tell you so."</p>

  <p>"A letter," Wingrave answered, "would have been equally efficacious.
  However, since you have told me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll go when I'm ready," Aynesworth answered, "and I've more to say. When
  I first entered your service and you told me what your outlook upon life was,
  I never dreamed but that the years would make a man of you again, I never
  believed that you could be such a brute as to carry out your threats. I saw
  you do your best to corrupt a poor, silly little woman, who only escaped ruin
  by a miracle; I saw you deal out what might have been irretrievable disaster
  to a young man just starting in life. Since your return to London, you have
  done as little good, and as much harm, with your millions as any man
  could."</p>

  <p>Wingrave was beginning to look bored.</p>

  <p>"This is getting," he remarked, "a little like melodrama. I have no
  objection to being abused, even in my own garden, but there are limits to my
  patience. Come to the point, if you have one."</p>

  <p>"Willingly," Aynesworth answered. "I want you to understand this. I have
  never tried to interfere in any of your malicious schemes, although I am
  ashamed to think I have watched them without protest. But this one is
  different. If you have harmed, if you should ever dare to harm this child, as
  sure as there is a God above us, I will kill you!"</p>

  <p>"What is she to you?" Wingrave asked calmly.</p>

  <p>"She&mdash;I love her," Aynesworth answered. "I mean her to be my
  wife."</p>

  <p>"And she?"</p>

  <p>"She looks upon me as her greatest friend, her natural protector, and
  protect her I will&mdash;even against you."</p>

  <p>Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," he said, "that the young lady is very well off as she
  is. She has lived in my house, and been taken care of by my servants. She has
  been relieved of all the material cares of life, and she has been her own
  mistress. I scarcely see how you, my young friend, could do better for
  her."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth moved a step nearer to him. The veins on his forehead were
  swollen. His voice was hoarse with passion.</p>

  <p>"Why have you done this for her?" he demanded, "secretly, too, you a man
  to whom a good action is a matter for a sneer, who have deliberately
  proclaimed yourself an evil-doer by choice and destiny? Why have you
  constituted yourself her guardian? Not from kindness for you don't know what
  it is; not from good nature for you haven't any. Why, then?"</p>

  <p>Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I admit," he remarked coolly, "that it does seem rather a problem; we all
  do unaccountable things at times, though."</p>

  <p>"For your own sake," Aynesworth said fiercely, "I trust that this is one
  of the unaccountable things. For the rest, you shall have no other chance. I
  shall take her to Truro tonight."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure that she will go?"</p>

  <p>"I shall tell her the truth."</p>

  <p>"And if she does not believe you?"</p>

  <p>"She will! If you interfere, I shall take her by force."</p>

  <p>"I interfere!" Wingrave remarked. "You need not be afraid of that. The
  affair as it stands is far too interesting. Call her, and make your
  appeal."</p>

  <p>"I shall tell her the truth," Aynesworth declared.</p>

  <p>"By all means! I shall remain and listen to my indictment. Quite a novel
  sensation! Call the young lady, by all means, and don't spare me."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth moved a few steps up the path. He called to her softly, and she
  came through the little iron gates from the rose gardens. She was very pale,
  and there was a gleam in her eyes which was like fear. Aynesworth took her by
  the hand and led her forward.</p>

  <p>"You must be brave, dear," he whispered. "I am compelled to say some
  disagreeable things. It is for your good. It is because I care for you so
  much."</p>

  <p>She looked towards Wingrave. He was sitting upon the garden seat, and his
  face was absolutely expressionless. He spoke to her, and his cold, precise
  tone betrayed not the slightest sign of any emotion.</p>

  <p>"Aynesworth," he remarked, "is going to tell you some interesting facts
  about myself. Please listen attentively as afterwards you will be called upon
  to make a somewhat important decision."</p>

  <p>She looked at him a little wistfully and sighed. There was no trace any
  longer of her companion of the last few weeks. It was the stern and gloomy
  stranger of her earlier recollections who sat there with folded arms.</p>

  <p>"Is it really necessary?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," Aynesworth answered hurriedly. "It won't take long, but
  there are things which you must know."</p>

  <p>"Very well," she answered, "I am listening."</p>

  <p>Aynesworth inclined his head towards the place where Wingrave sat.</p>

  <p>"I will admit," he said, "that the man there, whom I have served for the
  last four years and more, never deceived me as to his real character and
  intentions. He had been badly treated by a woman, and he told me plainly that
  he entered into life again at war with his fellows. Where he could see an
  opportunity of doing evil, he meant to do it; where he could bring misery and
  suffering upon anyone with whom he came into contact, he meant to grasp the
  opportunity. I listened to him, but I never believed. I told myself that it
  would be interesting to watch his life, and to see the gradual, inevitable
  humanizing of the man. So I entered his service, and have remained in it
  until today."</p>

  <p>He turned more directly towards Juliet. She was listening breathlessly to
  every word.</p>

  <p>"Juliet," he said, "he has kept his word. I have been by his side, and I
  speak of the things I know. He has sought no one's friendship who has not
  suffered for it, there is not a man or woman living who owes him the
  acknowledgment of a single act of kindness. I have seen him deliberately
  scheme to bring about the ruin of a harmless little woman. I have seen him
  exact his pound of flesh, even at the cost of ruin, from a boy. I tell you,
  Juliet, of my own knowledge, that he has neither heart nor conscience, and
  that he glories in the evil that his hand finds to do. Even you must know
  something of his reputation&mdash;have heard something of his doings, under
  the name he is best known by in London&mdash;Mr. Wingrave, millionaire."</p>

  <p>She started back as though in terror. Then she turned to Wingrave, who sat
  stonily silent.</p>

  <p>"It isn't true," she cried. "You are not&mdash;that man?"</p>

  <p>He raised his eyes and looked at her. It seemed to her that there was
  something almost satanic in the smile which alone disturbed the serenity of
  his face.</p>

  <p>"Certainly I am," he answered; "when I returned from America, it suited me
  to change my identity. You must not doubt anything that Mr. Aynesworth says.
  I can assure you that he is a most truthful and conscientious young man. I
  shall be able to give him a testimonial with a perfectly clear
  conscience."</p>

  <p>Juliet shuddered as she turned away. All the joy of life seemed to have
  gone from her face.</p>

  <p>"You are Mr. Wingrave&mdash;the Mr. Wingrave. Oh! I can't believe it," she
  broke off suddenly. "No one could have been so kind, so generous, as you have
  been to me."</p>

  <p>She looked from one to the other of the two men. Both were silent, but
  whereas Aynesworth had turned his head away, Wingrave's position and attitude
  were unchanged. She moved suddenly over towards him. One hand fell almost
  caressingly upon his shoulder. She looked eagerly into his face.</p>

  <p>"Tell me&mdash;that it isn't all true," she begged. "Tell me that your
  kindness to me, at least, was real&mdash;that you did not mean it to be for
  my unhappiness afterwards. Please tell me that. I think if you asked me, if
  you cared to ask me, that I could forgive everything else."</p>

  <p>"Every vice, save one," Wingrave murmured, "Nature has lavished upon me. I
  am a poor liar. It is perfectly true that my object in life has been exactly
  as Aynesworth has stated it. I may have been more or less
  successful&mdash;Aynesworth can tell you that, too. As regards
  yourself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I congratulate you upon your escape," Wingrave said. "Aynesworth is
  right. Association of any sort with me is for your evil!"</p>

  <p>She covered her face with her hands. Even his tone was different. She felt
  that this man was a stranger, and a stranger to be feared. Aynesworth came
  over to her side and drew her away.</p>

  <p>"I have a cart outside," he said. "I am going to take you to
  Truro&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Wingrave heard the gate close after them&mdash;he heard the rumble of the
  cart in the road growing fainter and fainter. He was alone now in the garden,
  and the darkness was closing around him. He staggered to his feet. His face
  was back in its old set lines. He was once more at war with the world.</p>

  <h2>XX. &mdash; REVENGE IS&mdash;BITTER</h2>

  <p class="first">At no time during his career did Wingrave appear before the
  public more prominently than during the next few months. As London began to
  fill up again, during the early part of October, he gave many and magnificent
  entertainments, his name figured in all the great social events, he bought a
  mansion in Park Lane which had been built for Royalty, and the account of the
  treasures with which he filled it read like a chapter from some modern
  Arabian Nights. In the city, he was more hated and dreaded than ever. His
  transactions, huge and carefully thought out, were for his own aggrandizement
  only, and left always in their wake ruin and disaster for the less fortunate
  and weaker speculators. He played for his own hand only, the camaraderie of
  finance he ignored altogether. In one other respect, too, he occupied a
  unique position amongst the financial magnates of the moment. All appeals on
  behalf of charity he steadily ignored. He gave nothing away. His name never
  figured amongst the hospital lists; suffering and disaster, which drew their
  humble contributions from the struggling poor and middle classes, left him
  unmoved and his check book unopened. In an age when huge gifts on behalf of
  charity was the fashionable road to the peerage, his attitude was all the
  more noticeable. He would give a thousand pounds for a piece of Sevres china
  which took his fancy; he would not give a thousand farthings to ease the
  sufferings of his fellows. Yet there were few found to criticize him. He was
  called original, a crank; there were even some who professed to see merit in
  his attitude. To both criticism and praise he was alike indifferent. With a
  cynicism with seemed only to become more bitter he pursued his undeviating
  and deliberate way.</p>

  <p>One morning he met Lady Ruth on the pavement in Bond Street. She pointed
  to the vacant seat in her landau.</p>

  <p>"Get in, please, for a few minutes," she said. "I want to talk to you. I
  will take you where you like."</p>

  <p>They drove off in silence.</p>

  <p>"You were not at the Wavertons' last night," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"No!" she answered quietly. "I was not asked."</p>

  <p>He glanced at her questioningly.</p>

  <p>"I thought that you were so friendly," he said.</p>

  <p>"I was," she answered. "Lady Waverton scarcely knows me now! It is the
  beginning of the end, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"You are a little enigmatical this morning," he declared.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! You understand me very well," she answered. "Everybody knows that
  it is you who keep us going. Lumley has not got quite used to taking your
  money. He has lost nearly all his ambition. Soon his day will have gone by.
  People shrug their shoulders when they speak of us. Two years ago the
  Wavertons were delighted to know me. Society seems big, but it isn't. There
  are no end of little sets, one inside the other. Two years ago, I was in the
  innermost, today I'm getting towards the outside edge. Look at me! Do you see
  any change?"</p>

  <p>He scrutinized her mercilessly in the cold morning light.</p>

  <p>"You look older," he said, "and you have begun to use rouge, which is a
  pity."</p>

  <p>She laughed hardly.</p>

  <p>"You think so? Well, I don't want Emily to see my hollow cheeks&mdash;or
  you! Are you satisfied, Wingrave?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I don't understand&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Don't lie," she interrupted curtly. "You do understand. This is your
  vengeance&mdash;very subtle and very crafty. Everything has turned out
  exactly as you planned. You have broken us, Wingrave! I thought myself a
  clever woman, but I might as well have tried to gamble with the angels. Why
  don't you finish it off now&mdash;make me run away with you?"</p>

  <p>"It would bore us both," he answered calmly. "Besides, you wouldn't
  come!"</p>

  <p>"I should, and you know that I would," she answered. "Everyone expects it
  of us. I think myself that it would be more decent."</p>

  <p>He looked at her thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"You are a strange woman," he said. "I find it hard sometimes to
  understand you."</p>

  <p>"Then you are a fool," she declared in a fierce little whisper. "You know
  what is underneath all my suffering, all my broken pride! You know that I was
  fool enough to keep the flame flickering&mdash;that I have cared always and
  for no one else!"</p>

  <p>He stopped the carriage.</p>

  <p>"You are the most original woman I ever met," he said quietly. "I neither
  wish to care nor be cared for by anyone. Go home to your husband, and tell
  him to buy Treadwells up to six."</p>

  <p>That same afternoon Wingrave met Aynesworth and cut him dead. Something in
  the younger man's appearance, though, perplexed him. Aynesworth certainly had
  not the air of a successful man. He was pale, carelessly dressed, and
  apparently in ill health. Wingrave, after an amount of hesitation, which was
  rare with him, turned his car towards Battersea, and found himself, a few
  minutes later, mounting the five flights of stone steps. Juliet herself
  opened the door to him. She gave a little gasp when she saw who it was, and
  did not immediately invite him to enter.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," Wingrave said coldly, "to inflict this visit upon you. If
  you are alone, and afraid to ask me in, we can talk here."</p>

  <p>Her cheeks became as flushed as a moment before they had been pale. She
  looked at him reproachfully, and, standing on one side to let him pass,
  closed the door behind him. Then she led the way into her sitting room.</p>

  <p>"I am glad that you have come to see me," she said. "Won't you sit
  down?"</p>

  <p>He ignored her invitation, and stood looking around him. There was a
  noticeable change in the little room. There were no flowers, some of the
  ornaments and the silver trifles from her table were missing. The place
  seemed to have been swept bare of everything, except the necessary furniture.
  Then he looked at her. She was perceptibly thinner, and there were black
  rings under her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Where is Mrs. Tresfarwin?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"In Cornwall," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"I could not afford to keep her here any longer."</p>

  <p>"What are you doing for a living&mdash;painting still?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head a little piteously.</p>

  <p>"They can't sell any more of my pictures," she said. "I am trying to get a
  situation as governess or companion or&mdash;anything."</p>

  <p>"When did you have anything to eat last?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday," she answered, and he was just in time to catch her. She had
  fainted.</p>

  <p>He laid her upon the sofa, poured some water over her face, and fanned her
  with a newspaper. His expression of cold indifference remained unmoved. It
  was there in his face when she opened her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Are you well enough to walk?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Quite, thank you," she answered. "I am so sorry!"</p>

  <p>"Put on your hat," he ordered.</p>

  <p>She disappeared for a few minutes, and returned dressed for the street. He
  drove her to a restaurant and ordered some dinner. He made her drink some
  wine, and while they waited he buried himself in a newspaper. They ate their
  meal almost in silence. Afterwards, Wingrave asked her a question.</p>

  <p>"Where is Aynesworth?"</p>

  <p>"Looking for work, I think," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Why did you not stay down in Cornwall?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Pengarth was away&mdash;and I preferred to return to London," she
  told him quietly.</p>

  <p>"When are you going to marry Aynesworth?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She looked down into her glass and was silent. He leaned a little towards
  her.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he remarked quietly, "you are already married?"</p>

  <p>Still she was silent. He saw the tears forced back from her eyes. He heard
  the sob break in her throat. Yet he said nothing. He only waited. At last she
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"Nothing is settled yet," she said, still without looking at him.</p>

  <p>"I see no reason," he said calmly, "why, until that time, you should
  refuse to accept your allowance from Mr. Pengarth."</p>

  <p>"I cannot take any more of your money," she answered. "It was a mistake
  from the first, but I was foolish. I did not understand."</p>

  <p>His lip curled with scorn.</p>

  <p>"You are one of those," he said, "who, as a child, were wise, but as a
  young woman with a little knowledge, become&mdash;a prig. What harm is my
  money likely to do you? I may be the Devil himself, but my gold is not
  tainted. For the rest, granted that I am at war with the world, I do not
  number children amongst my enemies."</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes then, and looked him in the face.</p>

  <p>"I am not afraid of you," she declared. "It is not that; but I have been
  dependent long enough. I will keep myself&mdash;or starve."</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders and paid the bill.</p>

  <p>"My man," he said, "will take you wherever you like. I have a call to make
  close here."</p>

  <p>They stood upon the pavement. She held out her hand a little timidly. Her
  eyes were soft and wistful.</p>

  <p>"Goodbye, guardian," she said. "Thank you very much for my lunch."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he said gravely, "if you would let me always call myself that!"</p>

  <p>She got into the car without a word. Wingrave walked straight back to his
  own house. Several people were waiting in the entrance hall, and the
  visitors' book was open upon the porter's desk. He walked through, looking
  neither to the right nor the left, crossed the great library, with its curved
  roof, its floor of cedar wood, and its wonderful stained-glass windows, and
  entered a smaller room beyond&mdash;his absolute and impenetrable sanctum. He
  rang the bell for his servant.</p>

  <p>"Morrison," he said, "if you allow me to be disturbed by any living
  person, on any pretense whatever, until I ring, you lose your place. Do you
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, sir."</p>

  <p>Wingrave locked the door. The next hour belonged to himself alone...</p>

  <p>When at last he rang the bell, he gave Morrison a note.</p>

  <p>"This is to be delivered at once," he said.</p>

  <p>The man bowed and withdrew. Wingrave, with his hands behind him, strolled
  out into the library. In a remote corner, a small spectacled person was busy
  writing at a table. Wingrave crossed the room and stood before him.</p>

  <p>"Are you my librarian?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The man rose at once.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir," he answered. "My name is Woodall. You may have forgotten
  it. I am at work now upon a new catalogue."</p>

  <p>Wingrave nodded.</p>

  <p>"I have a quarto Shakespeare, I think," he said, "that I marked at
  Sotheby's, also a manuscript Thomas a Kempis, and a first edition of Herrick.
  I should like to see them."</p>

  <p>"By all means," the man answered, hurrying to the shelves. "You have,
  also, a wonderful rare collection of manuscripts, purchased from the Abbey
  St. Jouvain, and a unique Horace. If you will permit me."</p>

  <p>Wingrave spent half an hour examining his treasures, leaving his attendant
  astonished.</p>

  <p>"A millionaire who understands!" he exclaimed softly as he resumed his
  seat. "Miraculous!"</p>

  <p>Wingrave passed into the hall, and summoned his major domo.</p>

  <p>"Show me the ballroom," he ordered, "and the winter garden."</p>

  <p>The little man in quiet black clothes&mdash;Wingrave abhorred
  liveries&mdash;led him respectfully through rooms probably unequaled for
  magnificence in England. He spoke of the exquisite work of French and Italian
  artists; with a gesture almost of reverence he pointed out the carving in the
  wonderful white ballroom.</p>

  <p>Wingrave listened and watched with immovable face. Just as they had
  completed their tour, Morrison approached.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lumley and Lady Ruth Barrington are in the library, sir," he
  announced.</p>

  <p>Wingrave nodded.</p>

  <p>"I am coming at once," he said.</p>
  <hr>

  <p><a name="ch2-21"
     id="ch2-21"><!--Chapter Anchor--></a></p>

  <h2>XXI. &mdash; THE WAY OF PEACE</h2>

  <p class="first">They awaited his coming in varying moods. Barrington was
  irritable and restless, Lady Ruth gave no signs of any emotion whatever. She
  had the air of a woman who had no longer fear or hope. Only her eyes were a
  little weary.</p>

  <p>Barrington was walking up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, his
  eyes fixed upon his wife. Every now and then he glanced nervously towards
  her.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he said, "if he wants a settlement&mdash;well, there's an end
  of all things. And I don't see why he shouldn't. He hasn't lent money out of
  friendship. He hates me&mdash;always has done, and sometimes I wonder whether
  he doesn't hate you too!"</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth shivered a little. Her husband's words came to her with peculiar
  brutality. It was as though he were blaming her for not having proved more
  attractive to the man who held them in the hollow of his hand.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't it strike you," she murmured, "that a discussion like this is
  scarcely in the best possible taste? We cannot surmise what he
  wants&mdash;what he is going to do. Let us wait!"</p>

  <p>The door opened and Wingrave entered. To Barrington, who greeted him with
  nervous cordiality, he presented the same cold, impenetrable appearance; Lady
  Ruth, with quicker perceptions, noticed at once the change. She sat up in her
  chair eagerly. It was what she had prayed for, this&mdash;but was it for good
  or evil? Her eyes sought his eagerly. So much depended upon his first few
  words.</p>

  <p>Wingrave closed the door behind him. His greetings were laconic as usual.
  He addressed Lady Ruth.</p>

  <p>"I find myself obliged," he said, "to take a journey which may possibly be
  a somewhat protracted one. I wished, before I left, to see you and your
  husband. I sent for you together, but I wish to speak to you
  separately&mdash;to your husband first. You have often expressed a desire to
  see over my house, Lady Ruth. My major domo is outside. Will you forgive me
  if I send you away for a few minutes?"</p>

  <p>Lady Ruth rose slowly to her feet.</p>

  <p>"How long do you wish me to keep away?" she asked calmly.</p>

  <p>"A few minutes only," he answered. "You will find me here when Parkinson
  has shown you round."</p>

  <p>He held the door open and she passed out, with a single upward and
  wondering glance. Wingrave closed the door, and seated himself close to where
  Barrington was standing.</p>

  <p>"Barrington," he said, "twenty years ago we were friends. Since then we
  have been enemies. Today, so far as I am concerned, we are neither."</p>

  <p>Barrington started a little. His lips twitched nervously. He did not quite
  understand.</p>

  <p>"I am sure, Wingrave&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>Wingrave interrupted him ruthlessly.</p>

  <p>"I give you credit," he continued, "for understanding that my attitude
  towards you since I&mdash;er&mdash;reappeared, has been inimical. I intended
  you to speculate, and you did speculate. I meant you to lose, and you have
  lost. The money I lent to your wife was meant to remain a rope around your
  neck. The fact that I lent it to her was intended to humiliate you, the
  attentions which I purposely paid to her in public were intended to convey a
  false impression to society&mdash;and in this, too, I fancy that I have been
  successful."</p>

  <p>Barrington drew a thick breath&mdash;the dull color was mounting to his
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>Wingrave continued calmly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I had possibly in my mind, at one time," he said, "the idea of drawing
  things on to a climax&mdash;of witnessing the final disappearance of yourself
  and your wife from the world&mdash;such as we know it. I have, however,
  ceased to derive amusement or satisfaction from pursuing what we may call my
  vengeance. Consequently, it is finished."</p>

  <p>The light of hope leaped into Barrington's dull eyes, but he recognized
  Wingrave's desire for silence.</p>

  <p>"A few feet to your left, upon my writing table," Wingrave continued, "you
  will find an envelope addressed to yourself. It contains a discharge, in
  full, for the money I have lent you. I have also ventured to place to your
  credit, at your own bank, a sum sufficient to give you a fresh start. When
  you return to Cadogan Square, or, at least, this evening, you will receive a
  communication from the Prime Minister, inviting you to become one of the
  International Board of Arbitration on the Alaskan question. The position, as
  you know, is a distinguished one, and if you should be successful, your
  future career should be assured."</p>

  <p>Barrington broke down. He covered his face with his hands. Great sobs
  shook him. Wingrave waited for a few minutes, and then rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Barrington," he said, "there is one thing more! What the world may say or
  think counts for very little. Society reverses its own judgments and eats its
  own words every day. A little success will bring it to your feet like a
  whipped dog. It is for yourself I say this, for yourself alone. There is no
  reason why you should hesitate to accept any service I may be able to render
  you. You understand me?"</p>

  <p>Barrington's face was like the face of a young man. All the cloud of
  suspicion and doubts and fears was suddenly lifted. He looked through new
  eyes on to a new world.</p>

  <p>"Thank God!" he exclaimed. "Not that I ever doubted it, Wingrave,
  but&mdash;thank God!"...</p>

  <p>Barrington left the house radiant,&mdash;Lady Ruth and Wingrave were
  alone. She watched him close the door and turn towards her, with a new
  timidity. The color came and went in her pale cheeks, her eyes were no longer
  tired. When he turned towards her, she leaned to him with a little seductive
  movement of her body. Her hands stole out towards him.</p>

  <p>"Wingrave!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>His first action seemed to crush all the desperate joy which was rising
  fast in her heart. He took one hand, and he led her to a chair.</p>

  <p>"Ruth," he said, "I have been talking to your husband. There are only a
  few words I want to say to you."</p>

  <p>"There are only three I want to hear from you," she murmured, and her eyes
  were pleading with him passionately all the time. "It seems to me that I have
  been waiting to hear them all my life. Wingrave, I am so tired&mdash;and I am
  losing&mdash;I want to leave it all!"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," he answered cheerfully, "what you are going to do. You are
  going to America with your husband."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she asked sharply.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I am rather tired of the game," he said, "that is all. I am like the
  child who likes to build up again the house of bricks which he has thrown
  down. I have procured for your husband a seat on the Alaskan Board. It is a
  very distinguished position, and you will find that it will entail
  considerable social obligations in America. When you return, he will be able
  to claim a judgeship, or a place in the Government. You will find things go
  smoothly enough then."</p>

  <p>"But you!" she cried; "I want you!"</p>

  <p>He looked at her gravely.</p>

  <p>"Dear Lady Ruth," he said, "you may think so at this moment, but you are
  very much mistaken. What you really desire is a complete reconciliation with
  your husband and a place in the great world which no one shall be able to
  question. These things are arranged for you; also&mdash;these."</p>

  <p>He handed her a little packet. She dropped it idly into her lap. She was
  looking steadfastly away from them.</p>

  <p>"You are free from me now," he continued. "You will find life run quite
  smoothly, and I do not think that you will be troubled with me when you come
  back from America. I have other plans."</p>

  <p>"There was a slave," she murmured, "who grew to love her gaoler, and when
  they came to set her free and take her back to her own people&mdash;she
  prayed only to be left in her cell! Freedom for her meant a broken
  heart!"</p>

  <p>"But that was fiction," he answered. "For you, freedom will mean other
  things. There is work for you to do, honorable work. You must fan the flame
  of your husband's ambition, you must see that he does justice to his great
  opportunities. You have your own battle to fight with society, but you have
  the winning cards for, before you go, you and your husband will be received
  as guests&mdash;well, by the one person whose decision is absolute."</p>

  <p>She looked at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>"My word of honor," he said quietly, "was enough for Lord Marendon. You
  will find things go smoothly with you."</p>

  <p>"You are wonderful," she gasped, "but&mdash;you&mdash;you spoke of going
  away."</p>

  <p>"I am going to travel," he said quietly, "rather a long journey. I have
  lived three lives, I am going to try a fourth!"</p>

  <p>"Alone?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Quite alone," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Tell me where you are going?" she begged.</p>

  <p>"I cannot do that," he answered. "It is my secret."</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet. She was very pale. She stood in front of him, and
  she laid her hands upon his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Wingrave," she said, "I will obey. I will live the life you have shown
  me, and I will live it successfully. But I will know this. Who is it that has
  succeeded where I have failed?"</p>

  <p>"I do not understand you," he answered.</p>

  <p>"You do!" she declared, "and I will know. For years you have been a man
  with a shell upon your heart. Every good impulse, every kind thought seemed
  withered up. You were absolutely cold, absolutely passionless! I have worn
  myself out trying to call you back to your own, to set the blood flowing once
  more in your veins, to break for one moment the barriers which you had set up
  against Nature herself. Some day, I felt that it must come&mdash;and it has!
  Who has done it, Wingrave? It is not&mdash;Emily?"</p>

  <p>"Emily!" he exclaimed. "I have not seen her for months. She has no
  interest for me&mdash;she never had."</p>

  <p>"Then tell me who it is!"</p>

  <p>"Nature unaided," he answered carelessly. "Human intervention was not
  necessary. It was the swing of the pendulum, Ruth, the eternal law which
  mocks our craving for content. I had no sooner succeeded in my new
  capacity&mdash;than the old man crept out."</p>

  <p>"But Nature has her weapons always," she protested. "Wingrave, was it the
  child?"</p>

  <p>He touched the electric bell. Taking her hands, he bent down and kissed
  them.</p>

  <p>"Dear lady," he said, "goodbye&mdash;good fortune! Conquer new worlds, and
  remember&mdash;white is your color, and Paquin your one modiste. Morrison,
  Lady Barrington's carriage."</p><br>

  <h2>XXII. &mdash; "LOVE SHALL MAKE ALL THINGS NEW"</h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. Pengarth was loth to depart. He felt that all pretext
  for lingering was gone, that he had outstayed his welcome. Yet he found
  himself desperately striving for some excuse to prolong an interview which
  was to all effects and purposes concluded.</p>

  <p>"I will do my best, Sir Wingrave," he said, reverting to the subject of
  their interview, "to study Miss Lundy's interests in every way. I will also
  see that she has the letter you have left for her within eight days from now.
  But if you could see you way to leave some sort of address so that I should
  have a chance of communicating with you, if necessary, I should assume my
  responsibilities with a lighter heart."</p>

  <p>Wingrave gave vent to a little gesture of annoyance.</p>

  <p>"My dear sir," he said, "surely I have been explicit enough. I have told
  you that, within a week from now, I shall be practically dead. I shall never
  return to England&mdash;you will never see me again. I have given life here a
  fair trial, and found it a failure. I am going to make a new
  experiment&mdash;and it is going to be in an unexplored country. You could
  not reach me there through the post. You, I think, would scarcely care to
  follow me. Let it go at that."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pengarth took up his bag with a sigh.</p>

  <p>"Sir Wingrave," he said, "I am a simple man, and life with me has always
  been a very simple affair. I recognize the fact, of course, that I am not in
  a position to judge or to understand the mental attitude of one who, like
  yourself, has suffered and passed through great crises. But I cannot help
  wishing that you could find it possible to try, for a time, the quiet life of
  a countryman in this beautiful home of yours."</p>

  <p>Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Pengarth," he said, "no two men are born alike into this world. Some
  are blessed with a contented mind, some are wanderers by destiny. You will
  forgive me if I do not discuss the matter with you more fully. My journey,
  wherever and whatever it is, is inevitable."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pengarth was braver than he had ever been in his life.</p>

  <p>"Sir Wingrave," he said, "there is one journey which we must all take in
  God's good time. But the man who starts before he is called finds no welcome
  at the end. The greatest in life are those who are content to wait!"</p>

  <p>"I am not in the least disposed to doubt it, Mr. Pengarth," Wingrave said
  calmly. "Now I must really send you away."</p>

  <p>So Mr. Pengarth went, but Wingrave was not long destined to remain in
  solitude. There was a sound of voices in the hall, Morrison's protesting,
  another insistent. Then the door opened, and Wingrave looked up with
  darkening face, which did not lighten when he recognized the intruder.</p>

  <p>"Aynesworth!" he exclaimed, "what are you doing here? What do you want
  with me?"</p>

  <p>"Five minutes," Aynesworth answered, "and I mean to have it. You may as
  well tell your man to take his hand off my shoulder."</p>

  <p>Wingrave nodded to Morrison.</p>

  <p>"You can go," he said. "Come back when I ring."</p>

  <p>They were alone! Aynesworth threw down his hat and crossed the room until
  he was within a few feet of Wingrave.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir?"</p>

  <p>Aynesworth laughed a little unnaturally.</p>

  <p>"I had to come," he said. "It is humiliating, but the discipline is good
  for me! I was determined to come and see once more the man who has made an
  utter and complete fool of me."</p>

  <p>Wingrave eyed him coldly.</p>

  <p>"If you would be good enough to explain," he began.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I'll explain," Aynesworth answered. "I engaged myself to you as
  secretary, didn't I, and I told you the reason at the time? I wanted to make
  a study of you. I wanted to trace the effect of your long period of isolation
  upon your subsequent actions. I entered upon my duties&mdash;how you must
  have smiled at me behind my back! Never was a man more completely and
  absolutely deceived. I lived with you, was always by your side, I was there
  professedly to study your actions and the method of them. And yet you found
  it a perfectly simple matter to hoodwink me whenever you chose!"</p>

  <p>"In what respect?" Wingrave asked calmly.</p>

  <p>"Every respect!" Aynesworth answered. "Let me tell you two things which
  happened to me yesterday. I met a young New York stockbroker, named Nesbitt,
  in London, and in common with all London, I suppose, by this time, I learnt
  the secret of all those anonymous contributions to the hospitals and other
  charitable causes during the last year."</p>

  <p>"Go on," Wingrave said.</p>

  <p>"I have come here on purpose to tell you what I think you are," Aynesworth
  said. "You are the greatest hypocrite unhanged. You affect to hate your
  fellows and to love evil-doers. You deceived the whole world, and you
  deceived me. I know you now for what you are. You conceived your evil plans,
  but when the time came for carrying them out, you funked it every time. You
  had that silly little woman on the steamer in your power, and you yourself,
  behind your own back, released her with that Marconigram to her husband, sent
  by yourself. You brought the boy Nesbitt face to face with ruin, and to his
  face you offered him no mercy. Behind his back you employ a lawyer to advance
  him your own money to pay your own debt. You decline to give a single penny
  away in charity and, as stealthily as possible, you give away in one year
  greater sums than any other man has ever parted with. You decline to help the
  poor little orphan child of the village organist, and secretly you have her
  brought up in your own home, and stop the sale of your pictures for the sake
  of the child whom you had only once contemptuously addressed. Can you deny
  any one of these things?"</p>

  <p>"No!" Wingrave answered quietly, "I cannot."</p>

  <p>"And I thought you a strong man," Aynesworth continued, aggrieved and
  contemptuous. "I nearly went mad with fear when I heard that it was you who
  were the self-appointed guardian of Juliet Lundy. I looked upon this as one
  more, the most diabolical of all your schemes!"</p>

  <p>Wingrave rose to his feet, still and grave.</p>

  <p>"Aynesworth," he said, "this interview does not interest me. Let us bring
  it to an end. I admit that I have made a great failure of my life. I admit
  that I have failed in realizing the ambitions I once confided to you. I came
  out from prison with precisely those intentions, and I was conscious of
  nothing in myself or my nature to prevent my carrying them out. It seems that
  I was mistaken. I admit all this, but I do not admit your right to force
  yourself into my presence and taunt me with my failure. You served me well
  enough, but you were easily hoodwinked, and our connection is at an end. I
  have only one thing to say to you. I am leaving this part of the world
  altogether. I shall not return. That child has some foolish scruples about
  taking any more of my money. That arises through your confounded
  interference. She is poor, almost in want. If you should fail her
  now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Aynesworth interrupted with a hoarse little laugh.</p>

  <p>"Wingrave," he said, "are you playing the simpleton? If Juliet will not
  take your money, why should she take mine?"</p>

  <p>Wingrave came out from his place. He was standing now between Aynesworth
  and the door.</p>

  <p>"Aynesworth," he said, "do I understand that you are not going to marry
  the child?"</p>

  <p>"I? Certainly not!" Aynesworth answered.</p>

  <p>Wingrave remained quite calm, but there was a terrible light in his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Now, for the first time, Aynesworth," he said, "I am glad that you are
  here. We are going to have a complete understanding before you leave this
  room. Juliet Lundy, as my ward, was, I believe, contented and happy. It
  suited you to disturb our relations, and your excuse for doing so was that
  you loved her. You took her away from me, and now you say that you do not
  intend to marry her. Be so good as to tell me what the devil you do
  mean!"</p>

  <p>Aynesworth laughed a little bitterly.</p>

  <p>"You must excuse me," he said, "but a sense of humor was always my
  undoing, and this reversal of our positions is a little odd, isn't it? I am
  not going to marry Juliet Lundy because she happens not to care for me in
  that way at all. My appearance is scarcely that of a joyous lover, is
  it?"</p>

  <p>Wingrave eyed him more closely. Aynesworth had certainly fallen away from
  the trim and carefully turned out young man of a few months back. He was
  paler, too, and looked older.</p>

  <p>"I do not understand this," Wingrave said.</p>

  <p>"I do!" Aynesworth answered bitterly. "There is someone else?"</p>

  <p>"Someone whom I do not know about?" Wingrave said, frowning heavily. "Who
  is he, Aynesworth?"</p>

  <p>Aynesworth shrugged his shoulders. He said nothing. Wingrave came a step
  nearer to him.</p>

  <p>"You may as well tell me." he said quietly, "for I shall postpone my
  journey until I know the whole truth."</p>

  <p>"It is not my secret," Aynesworth answered. "Ask her yourself!"</p>

  <p>"Very well," Wingrave declared, "I will. I shall return to London
  tonight."</p>

  <p>"It is not necessary," Aynesworth remarked.</p>

  <p>Wingrave started.</p>

  <p>"You mean that she is here?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Aynesworth drew him towards the window.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "you shall ask her now."</p>

  <p>Wingrave hesitated for a moment. An odd nervousness seemed to have taken
  possession of him.</p>

  <p>"I do not understand this, Aynesworth," he said. "Why is she here?"</p>

  <p>"Go and ask her your question," Aynesworth said. "Perhaps you will
  understand then."</p>

  <p>Wingrave went down the path which led to the walled garden and the sea.
  The tall hollyhocks brushed against his knees; the air, as mild as
  springtime, was fragrant with the perfume of late roses. Wingrave took no
  note of these things. Once more he seemed to see coming up the path the
  little black-frocked child, with the pale face and the great sad eyes; it was
  she indeed who rose so swiftly from the hidden seat. Then Wingrave stopped
  short for he felt stirring within him all the long repressed madness of his
  unlived manhood. It was the weakness against which he had fought so long and
  so wearily, triumphant now, so that his heart beat like a boy's, and the
  color flamed into his cheeks. And all the time she was coming nearer, and he
  saw that the child had become a woman, and it seemed to him that all the joy
  of life was alight in her face, and the one mysterious and wonderful secret
  of her sex was shining softly out of her eager eyes. So that, after all, when
  they met, Wingrave asked her no questions. She came into his arms with all
  the graceful and perfect naturalness of a child who has wandered a little
  away from home....</p>

  <p>"I am too old for you, dear," he said presently, as they wandered about
  the garden, "much too old."</p>

  <p>"Age," she answered softly, "what is that? What have we to do with the
  years that are past? It is the years to come only which we need consider, and
  to think of them makes me almost tremble with happiness. You are much too
  rich and too wonderful a personage for a homeless orphan like me; but," she
  added, tucking her arm through his with a contented little sigh, "I have you,
  and I shall not let you go!"</p>
