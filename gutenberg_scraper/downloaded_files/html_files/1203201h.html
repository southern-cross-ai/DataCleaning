  <h2><a name="chI"
     id="chI"></a>I.&mdash;THE MEETING</h2>

  <p class="first">The soft mantle of a southern twilight had fallen upon land
  and sea, and the heart of the Palermitans was glad. Out they trooped into the
  scented darkness, strolling along the promenade in little groups, listening
  to the band, drinking in the cool night breeze from the sea, singling out
  friends, laughing, talking, flirting, and passing on. A long line of
  carriages was drawn up along the Marina, and many of the old Sicilian
  aristocracy were mingling with the crowd.</p>

  <p>Palermo is like a night blossom which opens only with the first breath of
  evening. By day, it is parched and sleepy and stupid; by night, it is alive
  and joyous&mdash;the place itself becomes an <i>al fresco</i> paradise. It is
  night which draws the sweetness from the flowers. The air is heavy with the
  faint perfume of hyacinths and wild violets, and a breeze stirring among the
  orange groves wafts a delicious aromatic odor across the bay. Long rays of
  light from the little semi-circle of white-fronted villas flash across the
  slumbering waters of the harbor. Out of door restaurants are crowded; all is
  light and life and bustle; every one is glad to have seen the last of the
  broiling sun; every one is happy and light-hearted. The inborn gaiety of the
  south asserts itself. Women in graceful toilettes pass backward and forward
  along the broad parade, making the air sweeter still with the perfume of
  their floating draperies, and the light revelry of their musical
  laughter.</p>

  <p>'Tis a motley throng, and there is no respecting of persons. Townspeople,
  a sprinkling of the old nobility, and a few curious visitors follow in each
  other's footsteps. By day, those who can, sleep; by night, they awake and don
  their daintiest clothing, and Palermo is gay.</p>

  <p>The terrace of the Hotel de l'Europe extends to the very verge of the
  promenade, and, night by night, is crowded with men of all conditions and
  nations, who sit before little marble tables facing the sea, smoking and
  drinking coffee and liqueurs. At one of these, so close to the promenade that
  the dresses of the passers-by almost touched them, two men were seated.</p>

  <p>One was of an order and race easily to be distinguished in any quarter of
  the globe&mdash;an English country gentleman. There was no possibility of any
  mistake about him. Saxon was written in his face, in the cut of his clothes;
  even his attitude betrayed it. He was tall and handsome, and young enough not
  to have outlived enthusiasm, for he was looking out upon the gay scene with
  keen interest. His features were well cut, his eyes were blue, and his bronze
  face was smooth, save for a slight, well-formed moustache. He wore a brown
  tweed coat and waistcoat, flannel trousers, a straw hat tilted over his eyes,
  and he was smoking a briar pipe, with his hands in his pockets, and his feet
  resting upon the stone work.</p>

  <p>His companion was of a different type. He was of medium height only, and
  thin; his complexion was sallow, and his eyes and hair were black. His
  features, though not altogether pleasing, were regular, and almost classical
  in outline. His clothes displayed him to the worst possible advantage. He
  wore black trousers and a dark frock coat, tightly fitting, which accentuated
  the narrowness of his shoulders. The only relief to the sombreness of his
  attire consisted in a white flower carefully fastened in his button-hole. He,
  too, had been smoking, but his cigarette had gone out, and he was watching
  the stream of people pass and repass, with a fixed, searching gaze. Though
  young, his face was worn and troubled. He had none of the <i>sang froid</i>
  or the pleasure-seeking carelessness of the Englishman who sat by his side.
  His whole appearance was that of a man with a steadfast definite purpose in
  life&mdash;of a man who had tasted early the sweets and bitters of existence,
  joy and sorrow, passion and grief.</p>

  <p>They were only acquaintances, these two men; chance had brought them
  together for some evil purpose of her own. When the Englishman, who, unlike
  most of his compatriots, was a young man of a sociable turn of mind, and
  detested solitude, had come across him a few minutes ago in the long, low
  dining-room of the hotel, and had proposed their sharing a table and their
  coffee outside, the other would have refused if he could have done so with
  courtesy. As that had been impossible, he had yielded, however, and they had
  become for a while companions, albeit silent ones.</p>

  <p>The Englishman was in far too good a humor with himself, the place, and
  his surroundings, to hold his peace for long. He exchanged his pipe for a
  Havana, and commenced to talk.</p>

  <p>"I say, this is an awfully jolly place! No idea it was anything like it.
  I'm glad I came!"</p>

  <p>His <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> bowed in a courteous but abstracted manner. He had no
  wish to encourage the conversation, so he made no reply. But the Englishman,
  having made up his mind to talk, was not easily repulsed.</p>

  <p>"You don't live here, do you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The Sicilian shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No! It happens that I was born here, but my home was on the other side of
  the island. It is many years since I visited it."</p>

  <p>He had made a longer speech than he had intended, and he paid the penalty
  for it. The Englishman drew his chair a little nearer, and continued with an
  air of increasing familiarity.</p>

  <p>"It's very stupid of me, but, do you know, I've quite forgotten your name
  for the moment. I remember my cousin, Cis Davenport, introducing us at Rome,
  and I knew you again directly I saw you. But I'm hanged if I can think of
  your name! I always had a precious bad memory."</p>

  <p>The Sicilian looked none too well pleased at the implied request. He
  glanced uneasily around, and then bent forward, leaning his elbow upon the
  table so that the heads of the two men almost touched. When they had come
  into the place, he had carefully chosen a position as far away from the
  flaming lights as possible, but they were still within hearing of many of the
  chattering groups around.</p>

  <p>"I do not object to telling you my name," he said in a low tone, sunk
  almost to a whisper, "but you will pardon me if I make a request which may
  appear somewhat singular to you. I do not wish you to address me by it here,
  or to mention it. To be frank, there are reasons for wishing my presence in
  this neighborhood not to be known. You are a gentleman, and you will
  understand."</p>

  <p>"Oh, perfectly," the Englishman answered him, in a tone of blank
  bewilderment.</p>

  <p>What did it all mean? Had he run off with some one else's wife, or was he
  in debt? One of the two seemed to be the natural conclusion. Anyhow, he did
  not want to know the fellow's name. He had only asked out of politeness, and
  if he were in any sort of scrape, perhaps it would be better not to know
  it.</p>

  <p>"I tell you what," the Englishman explained, in the midst of the other's
  hesitating pause, "don't tell it me! I can call you anything you like for
  this evening. I daresay we I sha'n't meet afterwards, and if you want to keep
  it dark about your being here, why, then, I sha'n't be able to give you
  away&mdash;by accident, of course. Come, I'll call you anything you like.
  Choose your name for the night!"</p>

  <p>The Sicilian shook his head slowly.</p>

  <p>"You have been told my name when I had the honor of being presented to you
  at Rome," he said, "and at any chance mention you might recall it. I prefer
  to tell it to you, and rely upon your honor."</p>

  <p>"As you like."</p>

  <p>"My name is Leonardo di Marioni!"</p>

  <p>"By Jove! of course it is!" the Englishman exclaimed. "I should have
  thought of it in a moment. I remember Davenport made me laugh when he
  introduced us. His pronunciation's so queer, you know, and he's only been at
  Rome about a month, so he hasn't had time to pick it up. Good old Cis! he was
  always a dunce! I suppose his uncle got him in at the Embassy."</p>

  <p>"No doubt," the Sicilian answered politely. "I have only had the pleasure
  of meeting your cousin once or twice, and I know him but slightly. You will
  not forget my request, and if you have occasion to address me, perhaps you
  will be so good as to do so by the name of 'Cortegi.' It is the name by which
  I am known here, and to which I have some right."</p>

  <p>The Englishman nodded.</p>

  <p>"All right. I'll remember. By the bye," he went on, "I had the pleasure of
  meeting your sister in Naples, I believe. She is engaged to marry Martin
  Briscoe, isn't she?"</p>

  <p>The Sicilian's face darkened into a scowl; the thin lips were tightly
  compressed, and his eyes flashed with angry light.</p>

  <p>"I was not aware of it," he answered haughtily.</p>

  <p>The other raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Fact, I assure you," he continued suavely, not noticing the Sicilian's
  change of countenance. "Martin told me about it himself. I should have
  thought that you would have known all about it. Briscoe isn't half a bad
  fellow," he went on meditatively. "Of course, it isn't altogether pleasant to
  have a father who makes pickles, and who won't leave off, although he must
  have made a fine pot of money. But Martin stands it very well. He isn't half
  a bad fellow."</p>

  <p>The Sicilian rose from his chair with a sudden impetuous movement. The
  moonlight fell upon his white, furious face and black eyes, ablaze with
  passion. He was in a towering rage.</p>

  <p>"I repeat, sir, that I know of no such engagement!" he exclaimed, in a
  voice necessarily subdued, but none the less fierce and angry. "I do not
  understand your nation, which admits into the society of nobles such men. It
  is infamous! In Sicily we do not do these things. For such a man to think of
  an alliance with a Marioni is more than presumption&mdash;it is
  blasphemy!"</p>

  <p>"That's all very well, but I only know what I was told," the Englishman
  answered bluntly.</p>

  <p>"It's no affair of mine. I'm sorry I mentioned it."</p>

  <p>The Sicilian stood quite still for a moment; a shade of sadness stole into
  his marble face, and his tone, when he spoke again, was more mournful than
  angry.</p>

  <p>"It may be as you say, Signor. I have been traveling, and for many months
  I have seen nothing of my sister. I have heard such rumors as you allude to,
  but I have not heeded them. The affair is between us two. I will say no more.
  Only this. While I am alive, that marriage will not take place!"</p>

  <p>He resumed his seat, and conversation languished between the two men. The
  Englishman sat with knitted eyebrows, watching the people pass backward and
  forward, with an absent, puzzled look in his blue eyes. He had an indistinct
  recollection of having been told something interesting about this man at the
  time of their introduction. He was notorious for something. What was it? His
  memory seemed utterly to fail him. He could only remember that, for some
  reason or other, Leonardo di Marioni had been considered a very interesting
  figure in Roman society during his brief stay at the capital, and that he had
  vanished from it quite suddenly.</p>

  <p>The Sicilian, too, was watching the people pass to and fro, but more with
  the intent gaze of one who awaits an expected arrival than with the idle
  regard of his companion. Once the latter caught his anxious, expectant look,
  and at the same time noticed that the slim fingers which held his cigarette
  were trembling nervously.</p>

  <p>"Evidently looking out for some one," he thought. "Seems a queer fish
  anyhow. Is it a man or a woman, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>Soon he knew.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chII"
     id="chII"></a>II.&mdash;"SHE IS A SINGER"</h2>

  <p class="first">There was a brief lull in the stream of promenaders. The
  Englishman turned round with a yawn, and ordered another cup of coffee. From
  his altered position he had a full view of the Sicilian's face, and became
  suddenly aware of an extraordinary change in it. The restlessness was gone;
  the watching seemed to be at an end. The fire of a deep passion was blazing
  in his dark eyes, and the light of a great wistful joy shone in his face. The
  Englishman, almost involuntarily, turned in his chair, and glanced round to
  see what had wrought the change.</p>

  <p>He looked into the eyes of the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. A
  flood of silver moonlight lay upon the Marina, glancing away across the dark
  blue waters of the bay, and the soft dazzling light gently touched her hair,
  and gleamed in her dark, sweet eyes. She was tall, and clad in white flowing
  draperies clinging softly around her slim, girlish figure, and giving to her
  appearance an inexpressible daintiness, as though they were indeed emblematic
  of the spotless purity of that fair young being. Was it the chastened light,
  or was there indeed something spiritual, something more than humanly
  beautiful in the delicate oval face&mdash;perfect in its outline, perfect in
  its faint coloring and stately poise? She was walking slowly, her every
  movement full of a distinctive and deliberate grace, and her head a little
  upturned, as though her thoughts were far away among the softly burning
  stars, rather than concerned with the fashionable and picturesque crowd which
  thronged around her. A remark from her companion, a girl of somewhat slighter
  stature and darker complexion, caused her to lower her eyes, and in doing so
  they fell upon the eager, impassioned gaze of the young Englishman.</p>

  <p>Afterwards he was never ashamed to confess that that moment brought with
  it a peculiar lingering sweetness which never altogether died away. It was
  the birth of a new sensation, the most poignant of all sensations, although
  philosophers deny and materialists scoff at it. After all, there is something
  more than refined sensuality in love which has so sudden a dawning; there is
  a certain innate spirituality which sublimates and purifies it, so that the
  flame burns softly but brightly still through joy and grief, mocking at
  satiety, surviving the sorrow of gray hairs, triumphing over the desolation
  of old age, and sweetening the passage to the grave. He was a headstrong,
  chivalrous young man, passionate, loyal, and faithful, among all his faults.
  That first love of his never grew cold, never lessened. It lasted forever.
  For some men it is not possible to give the better part of themselves up to
  the worship of a pure woman; selfishness forbids it. But this young
  Englishman who sat there spellbound, absorbed in the consciousness of this
  new and sweet emotion, was not one of these.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she withdrew her eyes with a faint, conscious blush, and as she
  did so she saw for the first time the Sicilian. Her whole aspect swiftly
  changed. A terrified shudder swept across her features, and her lips parted
  with fear. She looked into a face but a moment before, at her first
  appearance, all aglow with passionate love, now black with suppressed anger
  and fierce jealousy. His eyes fascinated her, but it was the fascination of
  dread; and, indeed, his appearance was not pleasant to look upon. His thin
  form seemed dilated with nervous passion, and his eyes were on fire. Suddenly
  he conquered himself, and, with the swiftness of lightning across the water,
  the fierceness died out of his face, leaving it pale almost to ghastliness in
  the moonlight. He half rose from his seat, and, lifting his hat, bowed
  low.</p>

  <p>She answered his salutation timidly, and touched her companion on the arm.
  She, too, started as she saw that dark, thin figure gazing so steadfastly
  upon them, and her first impulse seemed to be to approach him. She stopped
  short on the promenade, and though there was a certain amount of apprehension
  in her dark eyes, there was also some pleasure, and her lips were parted in a
  half-welcoming, half-inviting smile. But he did not make any advance toward
  her; on the contrary, with a slight and almost imperceptible gesture, he
  motioned them to proceed. With a little wave of the hand, she obeyed him, and
  he resumed his seat, drawing his hat over his eyes, and no longer watching
  the stream of promenaders.</p>

  <p>The Englishman, absorbed in his own sudden passion, had seen nothing out
  of the common in the brief interchange of glances between the trio. All that
  he noticed was that his companion had saluted the taller of the two girls,
  and that she had acknowledged the salutation. It was quite enough for
  him.</p>

  <p>He leaned over the low palisade, watching her until she disappeared among
  the crowd, scarcely daring to hope that she might look back, and yet
  determined to lose no opportunity of a farewell glance should she do so. When
  she was finally out of sight, he drew a long breath and turned toward his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"Who is she?" he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I fear that I do not quite understand you," he said quietly, although his
  voice and limbs were trembling with passion; "to whom do you allude?"</p>

  <p>"The girl in white who passed just now. You knew her! Tell me her
  name!"</p>

  <p>"Why should I?"</p>

  <p>"I wish to know it."</p>

  <p>The Sicilian lit his cigarette. He was growing calmer, but the fingers
  which held the match were still shaking.</p>

  <p>"Possibly. But that is no reason why I should tell it to you. That lady is
  a friend of mine, certainly, but it is not the custom in my country, however
  it may be in yours, to bandy a lady's name about a public place."</p>

  <p>"But I am not asking out of curiosity," the other persisted, "nor am I a
  stranger to you."</p>

  <p>"What is your motive, if it be not curiosity?" the Sicilian asked, with a
  dark shade stealing into his face. "You had better be careful, Signor; there
  is danger at hand for any man who so much as directs an impertinent glance at
  either of those ladies."</p>

  <p>The Englishman was far too deeply in earnest to be angry.</p>

  <p>"You won't tell me, then?" he said simply.</p>

  <p>"I will not."</p>

  <p>"Certain?"</p>

  <p>"Quite certain."</p>

  <p>"Very good. I shall find out."</p>

  <p>The Sicilian laid his hand upon the other's arm. His black eyes were
  flashing angrily, and his tone was threatening.</p>

  <p>"Signor! a word of warning! I constitute myself the protector of those
  ladies. I have a very good right to do so. Any idle and public inquiries
  concerning them, or any attempt to obtrude an acquaintance upon them, I
  shall&mdash;punish! You understand!"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he answered. "You have only to prove the offense and the
  right of protectorship, and I shall be at your service. You probably know
  little concerning the men of my country. Let me tell you that we are not in
  the habit of forcing ourselves upon unknown ladies, nor in our respect for
  them are we second to the men of any nation in the world. I wish you
  good-evening, Signor."</p>

  <p>He walked away with his head in the air, an object of much curiosity to
  the many scattered little groups of dusky foreigners and Jews through which
  he passed. At the door of the hotel he paused for a moment, and then, instead
  of joining the stream of promenaders, he entered and slowly ascended the
  broad marble staircase toward his room. Just as he reached the first landing,
  however, he felt a light touch on his arm, and a guttural voice In his ear.
  He turned sharply round, and found before him one of the waiters&mdash;the
  one who had served him with his coffee outside.</p>

  <p>"Well! what do you want?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The man answered in a low tone, with his eyes glancing suspiciously around
  all the time.</p>

  <p>"The Signor was inquiring the name of the lady who passed by," he said
  apologetically. "The Signor spoke loudly, and I could not choose but
  hear."</p>

  <p>The Englishman came to a sudden standstill, and looked down into the
  ferretlike face and black eyes of the man who had followed him.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I can tell it to the Signor."</p>

  <p>"Look sharp then!"</p>

  <p>"The Signor is generous," he remarked, with a cunning look. "I have risked
  my place by leaving the terrace without permission to bring him this news,
  and I am poor&mdash;very, very poor!" he added, with a sudden drop in his
  voice which resembled a whine.</p>

  <p>The Englishman threw a piece of gold into the brown, greedy palm.</p>

  <p>"Tell it me, and be off," he said shortly.</p>

  <p>The waiter&mdash;half Greek, half native, and a thorough
  rascal&mdash;bowed low, and his beadlike eyes glistened.</p>

  <p>"The Signor is noble. The beautiful lady's name is Signorina Adrienne
  Cartuccio."</p>

  <p>"The singer?"</p>

  <p>"The same, Signor. The divine singer."</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>The Englishman turned toward the wide, open window, and gazed steadfastly
  at the place in the crowd where she had vanished.</p>

  <p>"She sings to-night, does she not?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Truly, Signor. Palermo is full of visitors from all parts of the island
  on purpose to hear her."</p>

  <p>"At what time?"</p>

  <p>"At nine o'clock, Signor, in the concert hall. If the Signor desires to
  hear her he should go early, for to-night is the only chance. She sings but
  once, and it is for the poor. They say that she has come to the Villa
  Fiolesse on the hill, to be away from the world, to rest."</p>

  <p>The Englishman descended the stairs and went slowly back to his seat. He
  had only one thought. In a few hours' time he would see her again. It would
  be Paradise!</p>

  <p>He reached his table and sat down. The seat opposite to him was empty. The
  Sicilian had gone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chIII"
     id="chIII"></a>III.&mdash;"BETTER THOU WERT DEAD BEFORE ME"</h2>

  <p class="first">On the brow of the Hill Fiolesse, at a sharp angle in the
  white dusty road, a man and woman stood talking. On one side of them was a
  grove of flowering magnolias, and on the other a high, closely-trimmed hedge
  skirted the grounds of the Villa Fiolesse. There was not another soul in
  sight, but, as though the place were not secure enough from interruption, the
  girl, every now and then, glanced half fearfully around her, and more than
  once paused in the middle of a sentence to listen. At last her fears escaped
  from her lips.</p>

  <p>"Leonardo, I wish that you had not come!" she cried. "What is the good of
  it? I shall have no rest till I know that you are beyond the sea again."</p>

  <p>His face darkened, and his tone was gloomy and sad.</p>

  <p>"Beyond the seas, while my heart is chained forever here, Margharita!" he
  answered. "Ah! I have tried, and I know the bitterness of it. You cannot tell
  what exile has been like to me. I could bear it no longer. Tell me, child! I
  watched you climb this hill together. You looked back and saw me, and waited.
  Did she see me, too? Quick! answer me! I will know! She saw me on the Marina.
  Did she know that I was following her?"</p>

  <p>"I think she saw you. She said nothing when I lingered behind. It was as
  though she knew."</p>

  <p>The Sicilian clasped his hands, and looked away over the sea. The
  moonlight fell upon his weary pallid face, and glistened in his dark sad
  eyes. He spoke more to himself than her.</p>

  <p>"She knew! And yet she would not wait to speak a single word to me! Ah! it
  is cruel! If only she could know how night by night, in those far-distant
  countries, I have lain on the mountain tops, and wandered through the
  valleys, thinking and dreaming of her&mdash;always of her! It has been an
  evil time with me, my sister, a time of dreary days and sleepless nights. And
  this the end of it! My heart is faint and sick with longing, and I hastened
  here before it should break. I must see her, Margharita! Let us hasten on to
  the villa!"</p>

  <p>She laid her hand upon his arm. Her eyes were soft with coming tears.</p>

  <p>"Leonardo, listen," she cried. "It is best to tell you. She will not see
  you. She is quite firm. She is angry with you for coming."</p>

  <p>"Angry with me! Angry because I love her, so that I risk my life just to
  see her, to hear her speak! Ah! but that is cruel! Let me go in and speak to
  her! Let me plead with her in my own fashion!"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Leonardo, the truth is best," she said softly. "Adrienne does not love
  you. She is quite determined not to see you again. Even I, pleading with
  tears in my eyes, could not persuade her. She has locked herself in her room
  while she prepares for the concert. You could not see her unless you forced
  yourself upon her, and that would not do."</p>

  <p>"No, I would not do that," he answered wearily. "Margharita, there is a
  question; I must ask it, though the answer kill me. Is there&mdash;any one
  else?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"There is no one else, Leonardo, yet. But what matter is that, since it
  cannot be you? Some day it will come. All that a sister could do, I have
  done. She pities you, Leonardo, but she does not love you. She never
  will!"</p>

  <p>He moved from the open space, where the moonlight fell upon his marble
  face, to the shadow of the magnolia grove. He stood there quite silent for a
  moment. Then he spoke in a strained, hard voice, which she scarcely
  recognized.</p>

  <p>"Margharita, you have done your best for me. You do not know what a man's
  love is, or you would not wonder that I suffer so much. Yet, if it must be,
  it must. I will give her up. I will go back to my exile and forget her. Yet
  since I am here, grant me a last favor. Let me see her to say farewell."</p>

  <p>She looked up at him in distress.</p>

  <p>"Leonardo, how can I? She has given orders that under no circumstances
  whatever are you to be admitted."</p>

  <p>"But to say farewell!"</p>

  <p>"She would not believe it. It has been so before, Leonardo, and then you
  have been passionate, and pleaded your cause all over again. I have promised
  that I will never ask her to see you again."</p>

  <p>"Then let me see her without asking. You can find an opportunity, if you
  will. For my sake, Margharita!"</p>

  <p>She laid her troubled, tear-stained face upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"It is wrong of me, Leonardo. Yet, if you will promise me to say farewell,
  and farewell only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Be it so! I promise!"</p>

  <p>"Well, then, each night we have walked past the Marina, and home by the
  mountain road. It is a long way round and it is lonely; but we have Pietro
  with us, and on these moonlight nights the view is like fairy-land."</p>

  <p>"And will you come that way home to-night, after the concert?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"It is good."</p>

  <p>"You will remember your promise, Leonardo," she said anxiously.</p>

  <p>"I will remember," he answered. "And, Margharita, since this is to be our
  farewell, I have something to say to you also, before I pass away from your
  life into my exile. In Rome I was told a thing which for a moment troubled
  me. I say for a moment, because it was for a moment only that I believed it.
  The man who told me was my friend, or he would have answered to me for it, as
  for an insult. Shall I tell you, Margharita, what this thing was?"</p>

  <p>Her face was troubled, and her eyes were downcast. The Sicilian watched
  her confusion with darkening brows. Since she made no answer, he
  continued:</p>

  <p>"They told me, Margharita, that you, a Marioni, daughter of one of
  Europe's grandest families, daughter of a race from which princes have
  sprung, and with whom, in the old days, kings have sought alliance, they told
  me that you were betrothed to some low American, a trader, a man without
  family or honor. They told me this, Margharita, and I answered them that they
  lied. Forgive me for the shadow of a doubt which crossed my mind, sister.
  Forgive me that I beg for a denial from your own lips."</p>

  <p>She lifted her head. She was pale, but her dark eyes had an indignant
  sparkle in them.</p>

  <p>"They did lie, Leonardo," she answered firmly, "but not in the fact
  itself. It is true that I am engaged to be married."</p>

  <p>"Betrothed! Without my sanction! Margharita, how is that? Am I not your
  guardian?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but, Leonardo, you have been away, and no one knew when you would
  return, or where you were."</p>

  <p>"It is enough. Tell me of the man to whom you are betrothed. I would know
  his name and family."</p>

  <p>"Leonardo, his name is Martin Briscoe, and his family&mdash;he has no
  family that you would know of. It is true that he is an American, but he is a
  gentleman."</p>

  <p>"An American! It is perhaps also true that he is a trader?"</p>

  <p>His coolness alarmed her. She looked into his face and trembled.</p>

  <p>"I do not know; it may be so. His father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Sicilian interrupted her. His face was marble white, but his eyes were
  afire.</p>

  <p>"His father! Spare me the pedigree! I know it! Margharita, stand there,
  where the moonlight touches your face. Let me look at you. Is it you, a
  daughter of the Marionis, who can speak so calmly of bringing this disgrace
  upon our name? You, my little sister Margharita, the proud-spirited girl who
  used to share in my ambitions, and to whom our name was as dear as to
  myself?"</p>

  <p>"Leonardo, spare me!"</p>

  <p>"Spare you? Yes, when you have told me that this is some nightmare, some
  phantasm&mdash;a lie! Spare you! Yes, when you tell me that this presumptuous
  upstart has gone back to his upstart country."</p>

  <p>She dropped her hands from before her face, and stood before him, pale and
  desperate.</p>

  <p>"Leonardo, I cannot give him up, I love him!"</p>

  <p>"And do you owe me no love? Do you owe no duty to the grandeur of our
  race? <i>Noblesse oblige</i>, Margharita! We bear a great name, and with the
  honor which it brings, it brings also responsibilities. I do not believe that
  you can truly love this man; but if you do, your duty is still plain. You
  must crush your love as you would a poisonous weed under your feet. You must
  sacrifice yourself for the honor of our name."</p>

  <p>"Leonardo, you do not understand. I love him, and cannot give him up. My
  word is given; I cannot break it."</p>

  <p>He drew a step further away from her, and his voice became harder.</p>

  <p>"You must choose, then, between him and me; between your honor and your
  unworthy lover. There is no other course. As my sister, you are the dearest
  thing on earth to me; as that man's wife, you will be an utter stranger. I
  will never willingly look upon your face, nor hear you speak. I will write
  your name out of my heart, and my curse shall follow you over the seas to
  your new home, and ring in your ears by day and by night. I will never
  forgive; I swear it!"</p>

  <p>He ceased and bent forward, as though for her answer. She did not speak.
  The deep silence was broken only by the far-off murmur of the sea, and the
  sound of faint sobbing from between her clasped hands. The sound of her
  distress softened him for a moment; he hesitated, and then spoke again more
  quietly.</p>

  <p>"Margharita, ponder this over. Be brave, and remember that you are a
  Marioni. Till to-morrow, farewell!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chIV"
     id="chIV"></a>IV.&mdash;"DOWN INTO HELL TO WIN THE LOVE HE SOUGHT"</h2>

  <p class="first">It was two hours later, and the Marina was almost deserted.
  The streets and squares, too, of the southern city were silent and empty. It
  seemed as though all Palermo had gathered together in that sprawling,
  whitewashed building, called in courtesy a concert hall. Flashes of light
  from its many windows gleamed upon the pavements below, and from the upper
  one the heads of a solid phalanx of men and women, wedged in together, threw
  quaint shadows across the narrow street. The tradespeople, aristocracy, and
  visitors of the place had flocked together to the concert, frantically
  desirous of hearing the great singer who although so young, had been made
  welcome at every court in Europe. It was an honor to their island city that
  she should have visited it at all; much more that she should choose to sing
  there; and the quick Palermitans, fired with enthusiasm, rushed to welcome
  her. The heavy slumberous air was still vibrating with the shout which had
  greeted her first appearance, and the echoes from across the scarcely rippled
  surface of the bay were lingering among the rocky hills on the other side of
  the harbor.</p>

  <p>The Sicilian heard it as he threaded his way toward the poorer part of the
  city, and a dull red glow burned for a moment in his sallow cheeks. It
  maddened him that he, too, was not there to join in it, to feast his eyes
  upon her, and listen to the matchless music of her voice. Was she not more to
  him than to any of them? So long he had carried her image in his heart that a
  curious sense of possession had crept into all his thoughts of her. He was
  frantically jealous, heedless of the fact that he had no right to be. He
  would have felt toward the man on whom Adrienne Cartuccio had smiled, as
  toward a robber. She was his, and his only she should be. Years of faithful
  homage and unabated longing had made her so. His was a narrow but a strong
  nature, and the desire of her had become the mainspring of his life. His she
  should surely be! No other man had the right to lift his eyes to her. As he
  hurried through those silent streets, he forgot her many kindly but firm
  repulses. Jesuitical in his love, any means by which he might win her seemed
  fair and honorable. And to-night, though he was stooping to treachery to
  possess himself of this long coveted jewel, he felt no shame; only his heart
  beat strong and fast with passionate hope. The moment had come at length for
  him to play his last card, and at the very prospect of success heaven itself
  seemed open before his eyes.</p>

  <p>He had been threading his way swiftly, and with the air of one well
  acquainted with the neighborhood, through a network of narrow streets and
  courts, filthy and poverty stricken. At last he came to a sudden pause before
  a flight of steps leading down to the door of a small wine shop, which was
  little more than a cellar.</p>

  <p>From the street one could see into the bar, and the Sicilian paused for a
  moment, and peered downward. Behind the counter, a stout, swarthy-looking
  native woman was exchanging coarse badinage with a man in a loose jersey and
  baggy trousers. There seemed to be no one else in the place, save another man
  who sat in the darkest corner, with his head buried upon his arms.</p>

  <p>The Sicilian only hesitated for a moment. Then he pulled his soft hat
  lower over his eyes, and lighting a cigarette, to dispel as far as possible
  the rank stale odor of the place, stepped down and entered the wine shop.</p>

  <p>Evidently he was not known there. The woman stared curiously at him as she
  passed the glass of cura&ccedil;ao for which he asked, and the man scowled. He took
  no notice of either, but, with his glass in his hand, made his way across the
  sawdust-covered floor to the most remote of the small tables.</p>

  <p>A few feet only from him was the man who slept, or who seemed to sleep,
  and all around quaint shadows of the tall buildings outside stealing in
  through the open window almost shut the two men off from the rest of the wine
  shop where the gas jets hung. The Sicilian smoked on in silence; his neighbor
  commenced to move. Presently the woman and her admirer resumed their talk,
  with their heads a little closer together and their voices lowered. They were
  absorbed in themselves and their coarse flirtation. The man sipped more
  liquor, and the woman filled his glass with no sparing hand. The strong
  brandy ran through his veins quicker and quicker. He tried to embrace the
  woman, and failed, owing to the barrier between them. He tried again, and
  this time partially succeeded. Then he tried to clamber over the counter, but
  missed his footing and fell in a heap on the floor, where he lay, to all
  appearance, too drunk to get up&mdash;helpless and stupefied.</p>

  <p>The woman peered over at him with a sneer on her face. Then she arranged
  the bottles in their places, and called out a noisy greeting to the Sicilian
  who was smoking silently among the shadows with only the red tip of his
  cigarette visible in the darkness. He made no reply. She yawned, and looked
  downward at the drunken man once more. There was no sign of life in his
  coarse face. He was wrapped deep in a drunken sleep, and he still had money
  in his pockets. Ah, well! It should be hers when these two strangers had
  gone.</p>

  <p>She turned to a little recess behind the bar, and, approaching the wall,
  looked at herself in a cracked looking-glass which hung there. Something in
  her hair needed rearrangement, and she remained there straightening it with
  her fingers. From where she stood she was within hearing distance if any one
  descended the steps and entered the wine shop, so she did not hurry. The
  contemplation of her coarse features and small black eyes seemed to inspire
  her with a strange pleasure. She remained at the glass, turning her head from
  side to side with a curiously grotesque satisfaction. Then one of her large
  glass earrings was dull. She took it out, and rubbed it vigorously on her
  skirt, humming a popular tune to herself the while. The whole thing took
  time; but what matter? There was no one in the vault save two drunken men,
  and another who chose to sit in the darkness without making any response to
  her advances. If a fresh customer had descended the greasy stone steps, and
  pushed open the rickety swing door, he would have found her in her place,
  ready with the usual coarse greeting or jest, should he chance to be a
  neighbor or an acquaintance. Meanwhile, she was happy where she was.</p>

  <p>In the wine shop itself things were not exactly as she supposed. No sooner
  had her back been turned, than the man near whom the Sicilian had seated
  himself slowly raised his head, and looked around. Assured of her departure,
  and after a moment's contemplation of the man who lay upon the floor to all
  appearance so hopelessly drunk, he turned toward the Sicilian.</p>

  <p>"My orders, Signor," he whispered. "It is to be to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"The Signorina will not listen to reason, then?"</p>

  <p>In the darkness the Sicilian felt the deep flush which stole into his
  olive cheeks. He was not there without an effort. In all his deeds and
  thoughts he had always reckoned himself as others had reckoned him, an
  honorable man. His presence in this place, and the means he was stooping to
  use, filled him with the most intense humiliation. Only one thing was
  stronger&mdash;his passionate love for Adrienne Cartuccio.</p>

  <p>"Do not breathe the Signorina's name," he muttered. "Receive your
  instructions, but make no comments."</p>

  <p>"Command, Signor; I am ready," was the whispered answer.</p>

  <p>"First; have you succeeded as you expected? The carriage and mules and
  men?"</p>

  <p>"In ten minutes I could have them all here, Signor. The task was not easy,
  but it is accomplished. They are at the Signor's disposal. All that remains
  is for you to give the orders."</p>

  <p>The Sicilian was perfectly silent for a moment. The darkness hid his
  face&mdash;hid the shame which for a moment lowered it, the shame which an
  honorable gentleman feels when he stoops to dishonor. It passed away before
  the stronger feeling, and when he spoke his tone was firm though low.</p>

  <p>"It is well. Listen, Pietro. The attempt is to be made to-night, in three
  hours' time. You will be prepared? The notice is sufficient?"</p>

  <p>"More than sufficient, Signor. The sooner the better. The mouths of my men
  are closed with gold, and they are carefully chosen; but, one and all, they
  love the wine, and wine, in its way, is as powerful as gold. See that animal
  yonder, Signor. My men love the drink as well as he, and before he reached
  that state he might have chattered away a dozen secrets."</p>

  <p>The Sicilian watched the man who was lying on the sawdust-strewn floor.
  Something in his breathing attracted him, and he leaned forward.</p>

  <p>"Is he asleep, do you think?" he whispered. "I thought I saw his eyes
  open."</p>

  <p>Pietro rose, and crawling like a cat, drew close to the drunken man. He
  passed his hand lightly over him, and listened to his breathing. Finally he
  crept back to his seat.</p>

  <p>"That is no spy!" he whispered; "he is only a common fisherman, and he is
  stupefied with drink. I watched him when he came in. Proceed, Signor. Let me
  know your plans."</p>

  <p>The Sicilian continued, speaking as rapidly as possible. He had conspired
  before, but honorably, and with men of his own rank. But here&mdash;in this
  low den, with such a companion&mdash;it made his heart sick. He was only
  anxious to get away as speedily as possible.</p>

  <p>"To-night the Signorina sings at the Town Hall. She leaves there at ten
  o'clock, on foot, accompanied only by another lady and a manservant who is in
  my pay. She will dismiss her carriage, and walk. The road to the Villa
  Fiolesse, you know. They will pursue it past the turn, thinking to follow a
  winding path which leads from it into the grounds of the villa about half a
  mile further on. The road is quite deserted there, and sheltered by pine
  groves. At the entrance to the first grove the cart and mules must be in
  waiting&mdash;also your men. There will be no resistance; but, above
  everything, Pietro, remember this&mdash;no discourtesy or roughness to either
  of the ladies. Let them be treated firmly, but with the utmost respect.
  Remember that one will be my wife, and the other is my sister!"</p>

  <p>"But you yourself, Signor! Shall you not be there?"</p>

  <p>"No! If all goes well, I shall follow, and join you at Ajalito. At that
  place more mules must be purchased, as we shall take the mountain road to the
  Castle of Marioni, and the cart will be useless. Is all clear to you,
  Pietro?"</p>

  <p>"It is clear, Signor!"</p>

  <p>"It may be that you will require more money. Here are a hundred francs.
  Use what you will."</p>

  <p>"I shall use all of them, Signor. To be well served requires good pay. The
  Signor shall be well served."</p>

  <p>"Spend it as you will, and come to me afterwards for your own reward. I
  will go now to make my own preparations. Be faithful this night, Pietro, and
  your fortune is secured. I am not one to forget a service!"</p>

  <p>"The Signor is a prince," Pietro answered, bowing. "See, the moon is
  behind a cloud. It is a propitious moment to leave this place without being
  observed. I, too, must go, but outside our ways lie apart."</p>

  <p>"Come, then," the Sicilian answered, rising quickly. "But one last
  caution, Pietro. See that your men understand perfectly that, for any
  rudeness or ill-usage to either of the Signorinas, they will answer to me
  with their lives. It may be that I shall not join you before daybreak. If so,
  remember that the man who offends those whom you guard, by so much as a look,
  shall die. His corpse shall whiten on the mountains for carrion crows to peck
  at!"</p>

  <p>"It is well, Signor. There is no fear."</p>

  <p>They crept out of the door, opening and closing it noiselessly, ascended
  into the street, and separated. The sound of their footsteps died away upon
  the rude stone pavements. For a minute or two unbroken silence reigned in the
  wine shop.</p>

  <p>"Diabolo!"</p>

  <p>The exclamation came from the man who had fallen while endeavoring to
  embrace the hostess, and who since, to all appearance, had been in a drunken
  sleep. A very remarkable change had come over him. He was sitting bolt
  upright on the floor, shaking the sawdust from his hair, and his dark eyes
  were no longer vacant, but bright and full of excitement. He peered
  cautiously over the counter. The woman who had repelled his advances was
  still loitering near the looking-glass. Then he stole softly on to his feet,
  and walking on tip-toe, and without the slightest difficulty, left the place.
  Outside he simulated once more the walk of a drunken man, and staggered down
  the street and out of sight.</p>

  <p>Presently the hostess of the place, having arranged her head-dress to her
  own satisfaction, came out behind the counter. She leaned over and looked for
  her drunken admirer. After all, he had money in his pocket, and he was not
  such a bad fellow. She would take him into her little room behind, and let
  him sleep for a while more comfortably. But&mdash;but where was he? He was
  not there. She turned the light higher and looked around. There was no one in
  the room at all. Two hopelessly drunken men and the stranger had left the
  place without making the slightest sound, or without calling for more drink.
  It was incredible. But it was true. The wine-shop keeper had never been so
  surprised in her life. Not only was she surprised, but she was frightened.
  The thing was beyond belief. The sweat broke out upon her forehead, and she
  crossed herself. The devil himself must have come and fetched them away, and,
  if so, why should he not fetch her. She was wicked enough. What a horrible
  thought.</p>

  <p>Half a dozen men, the crew of a fishing boat, suddenly entered the court,
  filling the air with their voices, and descended the steps. She came to
  herself while serving them, and commenced to forget her fright. But she did
  not mention that little occurrence, and the very thought of a drunken man for
  days afterwards made her shudder.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chV"
     id="chV"></a>V.&mdash;TREACHERY</h2>

  <p class="first">It was almost midnight, and Palermo lay sleeping in the
  moonlight. The concert was over, and the people who had shouted themselves
  hoarse with enthusiasm had dispersed at last to their homes. The last of the
  broad-wheeled, heavily-built carriages had rolled away through the white
  streets of the town. One by one the promenaders had left the Marina, and all
  sound had died away. There was a faint, sighing breeze in the orange groves
  around the bay, but scarcely a ripple upon the water. One man alone lingered
  drinking in the sweetness of the night. The Englishman sat on the last seat
  of the Marina, in the shadow of a cluster of orange trees.</p>

  <p>He had seen her again&mdash;nay, more, he had heard her sing&mdash;this
  girl-nightingale, who had taken the world by storm. Chance had favored him,
  insomuch that he had been able to secure almost a front seat in the concert
  room, and the wonderful music of her voice rang still in his ears. He had
  stolen out here to try and think it all over, and to calm the passion which
  had suddenly leaped up within him. It was quite a new experience through
  which he was passing; he scarcely knew himself. He was happy and miserable,
  sanguine and despondent, all in a moment. One question was always before
  him&mdash;one end, one aim. How was he to know her? How could he endure to
  live here, seeing her day by day for a brief while, without making her
  acquaintance? There was nothing to be hoped for from the Sicilian, who would
  not even tell him her name. Possibly, though, she would visit, or be visited
  by, some of the nobility of the place. This was almost his only hope. He had
  letters to most of them, and he made up his mind to present them all on the
  morrow.</p>

  <p>He sat there dreaming, with a burned-out cigar between his teeth, and his
  eyes idly wandering over the blue Mediterranean. Suddenly the stillness was
  broken by the sound of a soft gliding footstep close at hand. He had heard no
  one approach, yet when he looked up quickly he found he was no longer alone.
  A man in the garb of a native peasant was standing by his side.</p>

  <p>Naturally the Englishman was a little surprised. He half rose from his
  seat, and then resumed it as he recognized the dark, swarthy face and black
  eyes of the waiter who had told him Adrienne Cartuccio's name.</p>

  <p>"Hullo! What are you doing here?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I was in search of the Signor!" was the hasty response. "For an hour I
  have sought him everywhere, and now it is by chance that I am
  successful."</p>

  <p>The Englishman looked at him with suspicion. This change of dress was
  doubtless for the purpose of disguise. What was the meaning of it?</p>

  <p>"Well, and now you've found me, what do you want?" he asked, watching him
  closely.</p>

  <p>"I will tell the Signor. Is it not that he has an admiration for
  Mademoiselle Cartuccio, the singer? Well, she is in danger! It is for the
  Signor to rescue her."</p>

  <p>The Englishman sprang up with sparkling eyes, and pitched his dead cigar
  into the sea.</p>

  <p>"In danger!" he repeated breathlessly. "Quick! Tell me where!"</p>

  <p>The man pointed inland.</p>

  <p>"Do you see that belt of white road there, leading up into the hills?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; what about it?"</p>

  <p>"Have you noticed anything pass along it?"</p>

  <p>"There was a heavy cart or carriage and some mules, I think, went by half
  an hour ago."</p>

  <p>The native shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It was an hour, Signor, but no matter! Step back with me into the shadow
  of those olive trees. That is better. Now we cannot be seen, and I will
  explain."</p>

  <p>The Englishman beat the ground with his foot.</p>

  <p>"Explanations be damned!" he exclaimed. "Where is Mademoiselle Cartuccio?
  Quick!"</p>

  <p>The man held up his hands, and spoke more rapidly.</p>

  <p>"This evening I heard by accident of a plot to carry off Signorina
  Cartuccio by a rejected suitor. I hasten to inform the police, but on the way
  I pause. I say to myself, what shall I get for my pains, and for the risk I
  run? Nothing! Then I think of the Signor. I watched his face when the
  Signorina pass by, and I say to myself he has the passion of her. If I show
  him the way to save her he will be generous. He will win the lady, and he
  will reward poor Andrea."</p>

  <p>"That's all right. Tell me what to do, and I will give you fifty
  pounds&mdash;anything you like. Don't waste time. Speak up!"</p>

  <p>The man's eyes shone with cupidity. He went on rapidly:</p>

  <p>"The Signor is a prince. Listen! Along yonder road, before many minutes
  have passed, will come the Signorina Cartuccio with her friend, attended only
  by an aged servant. Men are waiting for them in the grove of orange trees
  above the Villa Fiolesse. Their orders are to carry off the two ladies to the
  other side of the island, where a place has been prepared for them. For an
  hour I have searched for the Signor, that he might procure aid, and so
  encounter these brigands, but in vain. I was in despair."</p>

  <p>"I want no help! How many of the black-guards are there?"</p>

  <p>"Four, Signor!"</p>

  <p>"Natives?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Signor."</p>

  <p>"And cowards, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>The man smiled.</p>

  <p>"They have not much bravery, Signor. I know the men."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't have anyone else here for the world," the Englishman said,
  shaking his fist.</p>

  <p>"Does the Signor want a knife?" asked the man, thrusting his hand into his
  inner pocket.</p>

  <p>"Not I. We don't understand that sort of thing in our country, my brave
  Andrea. Fisticuffs will settle this little matter, you'll see!"</p>

  <p>The man looked up admiringly at the Englishman's commanding figure and
  broad shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I think they will run away from the Signor when they see him," he
  whispered. "But let the Signor remember this: if one of them thrusts his hand
  inside his coat, so, do not wait one moment&mdash;knock him down or get out
  of his way. He will have the knife, and they know how to use it, these
  brigands."</p>

  <p>"Tell me the name of their leader&mdash;I mean the fellow who is trying to
  carry off the Signorina. Will he be there?"</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell the Signor his name. I dare not. I was once in his service,
  and he has powers&mdash;hush!"</p>

  <p>The two men held their breath, keeping well in the shadow of the orange
  grove. They had reached the road, and in the distance they could hear the
  sound of approaching voices.</p>

  <p>"I leave you now, Signor," whispered his companion to the Englishman. "I
  dare not be seen. To-morrow, at the hotel."</p>

  <p>He glided noiselessly away. The Englishman scarcely heard him, he was
  listening intently. Light footsteps were coming along the winding road toward
  him, and soon a laughing voice rang out upon the night air.</p>

  <p>"My dear Adrienne, don't you think we were a little foolish to walk home
  so late as this? See, there is not a soul upon the promenade."</p>

  <p>"<i>Tant mieux!</i>" was the light answer. "Is it not to escape from them
  all, that we came this way? The stillness is exquisite, and the night breeze
  from the sea, after that hot room, is divine. What a view we shall have of
  the bay when we get to the top of the hill."</p>

  <p>"They say that this place is infested with robbers, and it is terribly
  lonely," was the somewhat fearful answer. "Why would you not let poor
  Leonardo come with us?"</p>

  <p>"Because I did not want Leonardo, <i>cherie</i>. Leonardo is very good,
  but he wearies me by persisting to dwell upon a forbidden subject; and as for
  protection&mdash;well, I fancy Giovanni is sufficient."</p>

  <p>They were passing him now so close that he felt impelled to hold his
  breath. He had only a momentary glimpse of them, but it was sufficient. A few
  yards behind, a sullen-looking servant was trudging along, looking carefully
  around. In the white moonlight their faces, even their expressions, were
  perfectly visible to him; Adrienne's rapt and absorbed by the still restful
  beauty of the dreaming night, and indifferent to all fear; her companion,
  whose dark eyes were glancing somewhat anxiously around her, and Giovanni's,
  whose furtive looks, more expectant than apprehensive, marked him out to the
  Englishman as an accomplice in whatever devilry was afoot. Unseen himself, he
  watched them pass, and listened to their voices growing fainter and fainter
  in the distance. They were out of sight and out of hearing.</p>

  <p>He was preparing to follow them, when suddenly another sound broke the
  stillness. He held his breath, and crouched down, watching. In a minute, two
  dark forms, keeping carefully in the shadows by the side of the road, crept
  stealthily past.</p>

  <p>He waited till they, too, were out of sight, and then stood up with
  tingling pulses, but quite cool. Moving on tip-toe, he stepped lightly over
  the low stone wall into the road, and gazed after them.</p>

  <p>The ascent was steep, and the road curved round and round in zig-zag
  fashion. On one side it was bordered by a thickly-growing orange grove, whose
  delicate perfume was sweetening the still languid air. On the other was a
  stretch of waste open country, separated from the road by a low wall. He
  chose the seaward side, and keeping under the shadow of the trees, followed
  them, his footsteps sinking noiselessly into the thick dust.</p>

  <p>Once the two ladies paused to look back. He stopped too; and the two
  bending figures between them drew closer into the shadows, and waited. He was
  some distance away, but the sound of her voice floated clearly down to him on
  a breath of that faint night air.</p>

  <p>"Ah, how beautiful it is," she cried, pointing downward; "just a few
  steps, and we shall see the sea glistening through the leaves of the orange
  trees."</p>

  <p>"I am sure that it is not prudent, Adrienne. We have come past the
  footpath down to the villa, and this upper road is so lonely. Listen! I
  fancied that I heard footsteps."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence, then a low musical laugh which sounded to
  him like the sweetest music.</p>

  <p>"It was the echo of our own, you foolish child. There is nothing to fear,
  and have we not Giovanni?"</p>

  <p>Again they turned, and again he followed. Suddenly his heart gave a great
  bound. About fifty yards in front of the two girls was a rudely-built country
  carriage, drawn by a pair of mules and with a single man on the box. They had
  paused at such an unexpected sight, and seemed to be deliberating in whispers
  whether or no they should proceed. Before they had come to any decision, the
  two men had crept out from the shadow of the wall and trees into the road,
  and with bent bodies hurried toward them.</p>

  <p>He did not shout out or make any noise; he simply lessened the distance
  between him and them by increasing his pace. The two stooping forms, casting
  long, oblique shadows across the white, hard road, were almost level with
  their intended victims. Now the shadow of one of them crept a little in
  advance of the ladies, and Adrienne Cartuccio, seeing it, stepped suddenly
  back with a cry of alarm.</p>

  <p>"Giovanni! Giovanni! There are robbers! Ah!"</p>

  <p>The cry became a shriek, but it was instantly stifled by a coarse hand
  thrust upon her mouth. At the same moment her companion felt herself treated
  in a similar manner. They could only gaze into the dark ruffianly faces of
  their captors in mute terror. The whole thing had been too sudden for them to
  make any resistance, and Giovanni, their trusted escort, seemed suddenly to
  have disappeared. As a matter of fact, he was watching the proceedings from
  behind a convenient bowlder.</p>

  <p>The man who was holding Adrienne pointed to the carriage, the door of
  which the driver had thrown open.</p>

  <p>"This way, Signorina," he said "It is useless to struggle. We shall not
  harm you."</p>

  <p>She shook her head violently, and with a sudden effort thrust his hand
  away from her mouth.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" she cried. "Who are you? You can have my jewels, but I
  will never step inside that carriage. Help! help!"</p>

  <p>He wound his arms around her, and, without a word, commenced dragging her
  across the road.</p>

  <p>"You may shout as much as you like," he muttered. "There will only be
  echoes to answer you."</p>

  <p>A sudden warning cry rang out from his companion, and, with a start, he
  released his victim. The Englishman had stepped into the middle of the group,
  and, before he could spring back, a swinging left-hander sent him down into
  the dust with a dull, heavy thud.</p>

  <p>"You blackguard!" he thundered out Then turning quickly round he faced the
  other man, who had sprung across the road with bent body, and with his right
  hand in his breast. There was a gleam of cold steel, but before he could use
  the knife which he had drawn, his arm was grasped and held as though by a
  vice, and slowly bent backward. He dropped the weapon, with a shriek of pain,
  upon the road, and fell on his knees before his captor.</p>

  <p>The Englishman's grasp relaxed, and taking advantage of it, the man
  suddenly jumped up, leaped over the wall, and disappeared in the plantation.
  Pursuit would have been impossible, but none of them thought of it.</p>

  <p>The two ladies looked at their preserver standing in the middle of the
  road&mdash;fair and straight and tall, like a Greek god, but with a terrible
  fury blazing in his dark blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"You are not hurt, I trust?" he asked, his breath coming quickly, for he
  was in a towering passion. He was not speaking to the darker of the two girls
  at all; in fact, he was unconscious of her presence. He was standing by
  Adrienne Cartuccio's side, watching the faint color steal again into her
  cheeks, and the terror dying out of her eyes, to be replaced by a far softer
  light. Her black lace wrap, which she had been wearing in Spanish fashion,
  had fallen a little back from her head, and the moonlight was gleaming upon
  her ruddy golden hair, all wavy and disarranged, throwing into soft relief
  the outline of her slim, girlish figure, her heaving bosom, and the exquisite
  transparency of her complexion. She stood there like an offended young queen,
  passionately wrathful with the men who had dared to lay their coarse hands
  upon her, yet feeling all a woman's gratitude to their preserver. Her eyes
  were flashing like stars, and her brows were bent, but as she looked into his
  face her expression softened. Of the two sensations gratitude was the
  stronger.</p>

  <p>"You are not hurt?" he repeated "I am sorry that I did not get here
  sooner, before that fellow touched you."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand to him with a little impetuous movement.</p>

  <p>"Thanks to you. No, Signor," she said, her eyes suddenly filling with
  tears. "Oh, how grateful we are, are we not, Margharita?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, indeed we are. The Signor has saved us from a terrible
  danger."</p>

  <p>He laughed a little awkwardly. Where is the Englishman who likes to be
  thanked?</p>

  <p>"It is nothing. The fellows were arrant cowards. But what was the carriage
  doing here?"</p>

  <p>He pointed along the road. Already the clumsy vehicle had become a black
  speck in the distance, swaying heavily from side to side from the pace at
  which it was being driven, and almost enveloped in a cloud of dust.</p>

  <p>Adrienne shook her head. Margharita had turned away, with her face buried
  in her hands.</p>

  <p>"I cannot imagine. Perhaps they were brigands, and intended to carry us
  off for a ransom."</p>

  <p>The Englishman shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Odd sort of bandits," he remarked. "Why, they hadn't the pluck of a
  chicken between them, especially this one."</p>

  <p>He touched the prostrate figure with his foot, and the two girls
  shuddered.</p>

  <p>"He is&mdash;is not dead, is he?" Margharita asked.</p>

  <p>"Not he. I shouldn't say that he was very badly hurt either," the
  Englishman declared, bending down and listening to his breathing. "More
  frightened than anything. He'll get up and be off directly we leave. You will
  let me see you home?" he continued, speaking to Adrienne.</p>

  <p>She looked up at him with a gleam of humor in her wet eyes.</p>

  <p>"You don't imagine that we should let you go and leave us here?" she said.
  "Come, Margharita."</p>

  <p>The Englishman looked at the other girl, almost for the first time, as she
  came up and joined them. Her dark eyes were full of tears and her face was
  troubled. There was very little relief or thankfulness for her escape in her
  expression. The Englishman was no physiognomist, but he was a little
  puzzled.</p>

  <p>"There is no danger now, Signorina," he said reassuringly. "To-morrow I
  will go to the police, and I dare say that we shall get to the bottom of the
  whole affair."</p>

  <p>She shuddered, but made no reply, walking on by their side, but a little
  distance apart. As for the Englishman, he was in paradise. To all intents and
  purposes, he was alone with Adrienne Cartuccio, listening to her low voice,
  and every now and then stealing a glance downward into those wonderful eyes,
  just then very soft and sweet. That walk through the scented darkness, with
  the far-off murmur of the sea always in their ears, was like the dawning of a
  new era in his life.</p>

  <p>It was she who talked most, and he who listened. Yet he was very happy;
  and when they reached her villa, and he left them at the door, she gave him a
  white flower which he had found courage to beg for.</p>

  <p>"May I call on you to-morrow?" he asked, trembling for the answer.</p>

  <p>"If you would like to, yes," she answered readily. "Come early if you have
  nothing to do, and we will give you afternoon tea <i>&agrave; l'Anglaise</i>. By the
  bye," she added, a little shyly, "is there not something which you have
  forgotten?"</p>

  <p>He divined her meaning at once.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I ought to have told you my name!" he exclaimed hastily. "How
  stupid of me. It is St. Maurice&mdash;Lord St Maurice."</p>

  <p>"Lord St Maurice! Then are you not the fortunate possessor of that
  delightful little yacht in the harbor?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, if you mean the <i>Pandora</i>, she's mine. Do you like sailing?
  Will you come for a sail?" he asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"We'll talk about it to-morrow," she laughed, holding out her hand.
  "Good-night."</p>

  <p>He let her hand go. If he held it a moment longer, and a little more
  firmly than was absolutely necessary, was he much to blame?</p>

  <p>"Good-night," he said. "Good-night, Signorina," he added, bowing to
  Margharita. "I shall come to-morrow afternoon."</p>

  <p>Then he turned away, and walked with long swinging steps back to the
  hotel.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chVI"
     id="chVI"></a>VI.&mdash;"THE BITTER SPRINGS OF ANGER AND FEAR"</h2>

  <p class="first">"Margharita!"</p>

  <p>She had found her way into a lonely corner of the villa grounds, and, with
  her head resting upon her hands, she was gazing across the blue sunlit waters
  of the bay. Below, hidden by the thickly-growing shrubs, was the white, dusty
  road, and the voice which disturbed her thoughts seemed to come from it. She
  pushed the white flowering rhododendrons on one side, and peered through.</p>

  <p>"Leonardo!" she exclaimed. "Leonardo!"</p>

  <p>She seemed surprised to see him standing there, pale, dusty, and with a
  great weariness shining out of his black eyes, and it did not occur to her to
  offer him any greeting. She could not say that she was glad to see him, and
  yet her heart ached when she looked into his pale, sorrowful face. So she was
  silent.</p>

  <p>"Are you alone?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Adrienne is in the house, I believe."</p>

  <p>"Then I am coming in."</p>

  <p>She looked troubled, but she could not send him away. He clambered over
  the low paling, and, pushing back the boughs of the shrubs which grew between
  them, made his way up the bank to her side.</p>

  <p>"Have you been away?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have been home. Home," he repeated bitterly. "I have wandered
  through the woods, and I have climbed the hills where we spent our childhood.
  I have looked upon the old scenes, and my heart is broken."</p>

  <p>Her eyes filled with tears. For a moment her thoughts, too, went back to
  the days when they had been children together, and he had been her hero
  brother. How time had changed them both, and how far apart they had drifted.
  They could never be the same again. She knew it quite well. There had grown
  up a great barrier between them. She could not even pretend to sympathize
  with him, although her heart was still full of pity.</p>

  <p>"Leonardo, I am sorry," she whispered. "How is it, I wonder, that all
  through life you seem to have set your heart upon things which are
  impossible."</p>

  <p>"It is fate!"</p>

  <p>"Fate! But you are a man, and man should control fate."</p>

  <p>"Have I not tried?" he answered bitterly. "Tell me, do I so easily
  relinquish my great desire? Why am I here? Because I have said to myself that
  I will not be denied. Adrienne shall be mine!"</p>

  <p>She looked at him steadily.</p>

  <p>"We have not met, Leonardo, since the night after the concert. Do you know
  that we had an adventure on the way home?"</p>

  <p>"Tell me about it," he answered, looking away.</p>

  <p>"Is there any need, Leonardo?"</p>

  <p>A faint tinge of color stole into his olive cheek.</p>

  <p>"You guessed then," he said. "Tell me, does she know? Has she any
  idea?"</p>

  <p>"None."</p>

  <p>"She does not suspect me at all?"</p>

  <p>"No; she thinks that it was an ordinary attack by robbers, and that the
  carriage was to take us a little way into the interior, so that they might
  hold us and demand a ransom. It was her own idea; I said nothing. I feel as
  though I were deceiving her, but I cannot tell her. She would never look upon
  your face again, Leonardo."</p>

  <p>"You must not tell her," he muttered. "Swear that you will not!"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"There is no need. I am not anxious to denounce my own brother as a
  would-be abductor."</p>

  <p>"Margharita, I was desperate," he cried passionately. "And that cursed
  Englishman, he has become my evil genius. It was a miserable chance that
  enabled him to become your preserver."</p>

  <p>"It was a very fortunate one for you, Leonardo."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he cried sharply. "Tell me, has he been here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>He seemed to calm himself with a great effort. He was on the threshold of
  what he had come to know. He must keep cool, or she would tell him
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"Margharita," he said slowly, "the time is fast coming when I shall have
  no more favors to ask you. Will you remember that you are my sister, and
  grant me a great one now?"</p>

  <p>"If I can, Leonardo."</p>

  <p>"It is good. I shall not ask you anything impossible or unreasonable. Tell
  me the truth about Adrienne and this Englishman, Tell me how you have spent
  your days since this affair, and how often he has been here. Then tell me
  what you yourself think. Tell me whether she cares for him; and he for her.
  Let me hear the whole truth, so that I may know how to act."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. A yellow-breasted bird flew between them,
  and a shower of rhododendron blossoms fell at their feet. The lazy murmur of
  insects floated upon the heavy afternoon air, so faint and breathless that
  the leaves which grew thick around them scarcely rustled. A clump of pink and
  white hyacinths grew out of the wall, the waxy heads bent with the weight of
  their heavy, bell-shaped petals. She snapped off a white blossom, and toyed
  with it in her fingers for a moment. The lazy joy of the hot afternoon seemed
  to grate upon her when she looked into that white, strained face, deep lined
  and suffering. What right had nature to put forth all her sweet sights and
  perfumes, to be so peaceful and joyous, while man, her master, could feel
  such agony? It was mockery, it was not right or fair.</p>

  <p>She thrust the flower into his hand.</p>

  <p>"Leonardo," she whispered, "remember our watchword, 'Endurance.' I will
  tell you everything. Lord St. Maurice came on the day after our adventure. He
  stayed till evening, and we walked with him on the Marina. The next day we
  went yachting with him. Yesterday and to-day he has spent nearly the whole of
  his time here. I believe that he is in love with Adrienne, and as for her, if
  she does not love him already, I believe that she soon will. You have asked
  for the truth, my brother, and it is best that you should have it. Forgive me
  for the pain it must cause you."</p>

  <p>He passed his arm round the gnarled branch of a small chestnut tree, and
  then, turning round, hid his face. There was a great lump rising in her
  throat, but she dared not attempt to console him. She knew that he was angry
  with her&mdash;that he blamed her for his fruitless love, and despised her
  for the lover she had chosen. In the days of their youth they had both been
  dreamers. He had been faithful to the proud, romantic patriotism which had
  been the keynote of their idealism; she, in his eyes at any rate, had been
  utterly faithless. Only her affection had remained steadfast, and even that
  he had commenced to doubt.</p>

  <p>Presently he turned and faced her. His face was ghastly white, but his
  eyes were hot and red.</p>

  <p>"Where is she?" he asked. "I am going to her. I am going to see with my
  own eyes, and hear with my own ears, whether this story of yours be true.
  Where is she?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Leonardo," she said, "forgive me; but you will frighten her if you go as
  you are now. Your clothes are all dusty and ragged, and you look as though
  you were on the threshold of a fever. Besides, she is asleep. Go down to the
  hotel and change your clothes, and then ride up here to call. Somehow or
  other I will manage that she shall see you then."</p>

  <p>He looked down at himself and smiled bitterly.</p>

  <p>"It is true," he said, "I look but a sorry lover. Remember, Margharita,
  that I hold you to your promise. In an hour I shall return."</p>

  <p>He left the grounds, and walked down the hill, with bent shoulders, and
  never a glance to the right or the left.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chVII"
     id="chVII"></a>VII.&mdash;COMFORT! COMFORT SCORNED OF DEVILS</h2>

  <p class="first">"Adrienne, I am the happiest man in the world."</p>

  <p>"For how long, sir?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Pour la vie</i>," he answered solemnly.</p>

  <p>Her hand stole softly into his, and there was a long silence between them.
  What need had they of words? It is only the lighter form of love, fancy
  touched by sentiment, which seeks for expressions by such means. Their love
  was different; a silent consciousness of each other's presence sufficed for
  them. And so they sat there, side by side, steeped in the deep, subtle joy of
  that perfect love which upon the nature of both the man and the woman had so
  chastening and spiritualizing an influence. There was a new music in their
  lives, a sweeter harmony than either of them had ever been conscious of
  before. The world had grown more beautiful&mdash;and it was for them. The
  love which widens and deepens also narrows. Humanity was a forgotten factor
  in their thoughts. All that they saw and dreamed of was theirs to taste, to
  admire and to enjoy together. It was for them that the silvery moon and the
  softly burning stars cast upon the sleeping earth a strange new beauty. It
  was for them the air hung heavy with the faint perfume of spices, and the
  mingled scents of heliotrope and violets. It was for them that the dark pine
  trees waved softly backward and forward against the violet sky; for them that
  the far-away sea made melancholy music against the pebbly beach, and the soft
  night wind rustled among the tree tops in the orange groves. All nature was
  fair for their sakes. It is the grand selfishness of love&mdash;a noble
  vice.</p>

  <p>"Adrienne!"</p>

  <p>They both started and looked round. The voice was harsh and agitated, and
  it broke in like a jarring note upon their sweet, absorbed silence. It was
  Leonardo di Marioni who stood before them on the balcony&mdash;Leonardo, with
  white face and darkly-gleaming eyes. To Lord St. Maurice, that stifled cry
  had sounded like the hiss of the snake in paradise, and when he looked up the
  simile seemed completed.</p>

  <p>"Is it you, Leonardo?" Adrienne said, letting go her lover's hand, and
  leaning back in her chair. "Your entrance is a little unceremonious, is it
  not? Were there no servants to announce you, or to bring me word of your
  presence? I dislike surprises."</p>

  <p>"And I, too, Adrienne&mdash;I, too, dislike surprises," he answered, his
  voice quivering with passion. "I find one awaiting me here."</p>

  <p>She rose and stood facing him, cold but angry.</p>

  <p>"You are forgetting yourself, Count di Marioni, and your speech is a
  presumption. We have been friends, but, if you wish our friendship to
  continue, you will alter your tone. You have no right to speak to me in that
  tone, and I expect an apology."</p>

  <p>His lips quivered, and he spoke with a strange bitterness.</p>

  <p>"No right! Ay, you say well 'no right,' Adrienne. Will you spare me a few
  moments alone? I have a thing to say to you."</p>

  <p>She frowned and hesitated for a moment. After all, she had a woman's
  heart, and she could not choose but pity him.</p>

  <p>"Will not another time do, Leonardo?" she asked almost gently. "You see I
  have a visitor."</p>

  <p>Yes, he saw it. He had looked up into the handsome, debonair face, with
  that proud, happy smile upon the parted lips, from the garden path below. How
  he hated it.</p>

  <p>"I may be summoned away from Palermo at any moment," he said. "Cannot you
  spare me a short five minutes? I will go away then."</p>

  <p>She looked down at her lover. He rose to his feet promptly.</p>

  <p>"I'll have a cigar among the magnolias," he exclaimed. "Call me when I may
  come up."</p>

  <p>A look passed between them which sent a swift, keen pain through the
  Sicilian's heart. Then Lord St. Maurice vaulted over the balcony, alighting
  in the garden below, and they were alone.</p>

  <p>"Adrienne!" Leonardo cried, and his voice was low and bitter, "I dare not
  ask, and yet I must know. Tell me quickly. Don't torture me. You care for
  this Englishman?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You love him?"</p>

  <p>"Dearly. With all my heart."</p>

  <p>"You are going to marry him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>And not all her pity could keep the joy from her tone as she uttered the
  last monosyllable.</p>

  <p>"My God! My God!"</p>

  <p>The suffering in his white face was awful to see. Her eyes filled with
  tears. She knew that she had done this man no wrong, that he had never had a
  single word of definite encouragement from her, that, time after time, she
  had told him that his love was hopeless. Yet her heart was heavy as she
  watched his anguish.</p>

  <p>"Leonardo!" she said softly, "I am sorry. But surely you do not blame me?
  Is it my fault that I love him, and not you? Have I not begged you often to
  accept the only answer I could ever give you? Be generous, Leonardo, and let
  us be friends."</p>

  <p>It was several moments before he spoke, and then it seemed as though there
  had been a conflict in the man, and the worse half had conquered. The dumb
  grief in his eyes, which had been so piteous to witness, had changed suddenly
  into a furious, passionate anger. He shook with the violence of his emotions,
  and though she was used to his stormy, impetuous nature, she was
  frightened.</p>

  <p>"Friends! A curse upon such folly! Is it for friendship's sake that I have
  followed you here at the risk of my life, just to breathe the same air, to
  look but now and then into your face? Ah! Adrienne! Adrienne! listen once
  more to me. Do you think that he can love as I do? Never! never! I know that
  sluggish English temperament. Their wives are their servants or their dolls.
  Their passion is the passion of animals, and they have not even
  constancy."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand. He had destroyed her pity. Henceforth he was
  obnoxious to her.</p>

  <p>"Leave me," she commanded. "You are talking of what you do not understand.
  You are insulting me. I detest you!"</p>

  <p>"Detest me!" he laughed hysterically, and the fire in his eyes grew
  brighter. "Since when? Since this cursed Englishman whispered his lies into
  your ears and stole you from me. Nay, do not shake your head. Mine you would
  have been some day, as surely as now you have made my life a hell. My love
  would have conquered in the end. It would have worn away your coldness and
  your resistance drop by drop. Mother of God! it shall conquer! Do I come of a
  race who are content to stand calmly by and see the woman they love stolen
  away by strangers? No!"</p>

  <p>He stopped short, and there was a strange look in his face. Adrienne saw
  it, and trembled.</p>

  <p>"Leonardo," she said, "I call a man who cannot bear a disappointment a
  coward. I do not love you; and under no circumstances whatever would it have
  been possible for me ever to have married you. Never! never!"</p>

  <p>He turned on his heel and walked away.</p>

  <p>"We shall see!" he said. "<i>Au revoir</i>, my cousin."</p>

  <p>The emphasis in his tone, and a certain fixed look in his face chilled
  her. She held up her hands, and he stayed.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" she said, speaking slowly, and with her eyes fixed steadily upon
  him. "I do not wish to think ill of you; I do not wish to think that you
  could harm the man I love; but, if you did&mdash;if you did, I say&mdash;you
  should taste a woman's vengeance! You think me weak, but there are things
  which will fire the blood and steel the nerve of a weaker woman than I am.
  Remember, Leonardo! Lift but your little finger against Lord St. Maurice, and
  all ties of kindred and country are forgotten. Those means which lie ready to
  my hand, I will use! I have warned you! Remember!"</p>

  <p>Her tone had passed from earnestness to solemnity; her attitude, her final
  gesture, were full of dramatic grace. Beside her, he appeared mean and
  insignificant.</p>

  <p>"I thank you for your candor, cousin," he said slowly. "If I harm your
  lover&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you harm him," she interrupted fiercely, "you will win my undying
  hate, even while you are undergoing my vengeance. You know my power,
  Leonardo; you know the means which lie ready to my hand. Never doubt but that
  I shall use them."</p>

  <p>He turned round and walked out of the house, passing Lord St. Maurice in
  the garden without even glancing toward him. In the road he paused for a
  moment, watching the long shadows pass quivering across the dark hills, and
  the gleam of the moonlight upon the water far away below.</p>

  <p>"She would never dare!" he murmured to himself. "She is a woman, and she
  would forget."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chVIII"
     id="chVIII"></a>VIII.&mdash;"DEATH IN THE FACE, AND MURDER IN THE
     HEART"</h2>

  <p class="first">Lord St. Maurice was in a good humor with himself and the
  entire world that night. He had spent nearly the whole of the day with the
  woman he loved, and whom he was shortly to marry, and with the prospect of
  another such day on the morrow, even his temporary exile from paradise was
  not a very severe trial. He was an ardent suitor, and deeply in love, but an
  hour or two alone with a case of excellent cigars, with delightful thoughts
  to keep him company, the softest air in Europe to breathe, and one of the
  most picturesque sights to look upon, could scarcely be esteemed a hardship.
  Above him, among the woods, twinkled the bright lights of the Villa Fiolesse
  which he had just quitted, and below was the gay little Marina, still dotted
  about with groups of men in soft hats and light clothes, and bright-eyed,
  laughing women, whose musical voices rang out on the still night air with
  strange distinctness.</p>

  <p>Through the clinging magnolia bushes and rhododendron shrubs he pushed his
  way downward, the red end of his cigar shining out like a signal light in the
  semi-purple darkness. Every now and then he stopped to take a breath of air
  perfumed by a clump of hyacinth, or some star-shaped flower which had yielded
  up its sweetness to the softly-falling night. Now and then, too, he took a
  lover's look at the stars, and downward to the softly-heaving bosom of the
  Mediterranean. All these things seemed to mean so much more to him now!
  Adrienne had changed the world, and he was looking out upon it with different
  eyes. Sentiment, which before he had scoffed at a little, as became a sturdy
  young Briton but lately escaped from public school and college, had suddenly
  become for him something akin to a holy thing. He was almost a poet that
  night&mdash;he who had scarcely read a line of what the world calls poetry
  since his school days. There was a man whom he had hated all his life. Just
  then he began to think of him without a particle of anger or resentment. If
  he could have met him there, among those drooping, white-flowering shrubs, he
  felt that he could have shaken his hand, have asked him heartily after his
  health, and doubtless have fixed a day to dine with him. The world was a
  capital place, and Palermo was on the threshold of heaven. His big, boyish
  heart was full to over-flowing. Oh! it is a fine thing to be in love!</p>

  <p>From the present he began to think a little of the future. He was right in
  the clouds, and he began to dream. At twenty-five years old imagination is
  the master of the man; at forty the situations are reversed; but in losing
  the upper hand imagination often loses its power and freshness. Lord St.
  Maurice was in his twenty-sixth year, and he began to dream. He was his own
  master, and he was rich. There was a fine estate in Eastshire, a shooting
  lodge in Scotland, and a box in Leicestershire. Which would Adrienne prefer?
  How delightful it would be to take her to them in the proper seasons, and
  find out which one pleased her most. When they reached England, after a
  cruise as far as Cairo and back along the Mediterranean, July would be on the
  wane. It was just the best time. They would go straight to Scotland and have
  a few days alone upon those glorious moors before the shooting commenced. He
  remembered, with a little laugh, the bachelor invitations which he had given,
  and which must now be rescinded. Bother bachelor invitations! Adrienne was
  sure to like Scotland. This southern land with its profusion of flowers, its
  deep, intense coloring, and its softly-blowing winds, was beautiful enough in
  its way, but the purple covered moors and cloud-topped hills of Scotland had
  their own charm. Adrienne had never seen heather; and his long, low cottage
  was set in a very sea of it. How pleasant the evening would be, out on the
  balcony, with the red sun sinking down behind Bathness Hill. Ah! how happy
  they would be. Life had never seemed so fair a thing!</p>

  <p>He was on the Marina by this time, elbowing his way among the people who
  were still lazily walking backward and forward, or standing in little knots
  talking. The open-air restaurant, too, was crowded, but there were a few
  vacant seats, and among them the little iron chair in which he had been
  lounging on that evening when Adrienne Cartuccio had passed by among the
  crowd. He stopped short, and stepping lightly over the railing, drew it to
  him, and sat down. The busy waiter was by his side in a moment with coffee
  and liqueurs, and taking a cigar from his case he began meditatively to
  smoke.</p>

  <p>Since sundown the hot air had grown closer and more sulphurous, and away
  westward over the waters the heavens seemed to be continually opening and
  closing, belching out great sheets of yellow light. A few detached masses of
  black clouds were slowly floating across the starlit sky. Now one had reached
  the moon, and a sudden darkness fell upon the earth. With such a lamp in the
  sky illuminations in the hotel gardens were a thing unheard of, and the
  effect was singular. Only the red lights of the smokers were visible, dotted
  here and there like glow-worms. Conversation, too, dropped. Men lowered their
  voices, the women ceased to make the air alive with the music of their
  laughter. It was the southern nature. When the sky was fair, their hearts
  were light and their voices gay. Now there was a momentary gloom, and every
  one shivered.</p>

  <p>The Englishman looked up at the cloud, wondered whether there would be a
  storm, and calmly went on smoking. The sudden hush and darkness meant nothing
  to him. In his state of mind they were rather welcome than otherwise. But in
  the midst of the darkness a strange thing happened.</p>

  <p>He was neither superstitious nor impressionable. From either weakness he
  would contemptuously, and with perfect truth, have declared himself
  altogether free. But suddenly the sweet, swiftly-flowing current of his
  thoughts came to a full stop. He was conscious of a cold chill, which he
  could not in any way explain. There had been no sound of footsteps, nothing
  to warn him of it, but he fancied himself abruptly encountered by some
  nameless danger. The perspiration broke out upon his forehead, and the cigar
  dropped from his fingers. Was it a nightmare, the prelude to a fever? Was he
  going mad? Oh! it was horrible!</p>

  <p>By a great effort of will he contrived to raise his eyes to the cloud. It
  had almost passed away from the face of the moon. The main body of it was
  already floating northward, only one long jagged edge remained. There could
  be only a second or two more of this unnatural gloom. His heart was thankful
  for it. Ah! what was that? He bit his tongue hard, or he would have called
  out. Either he was dreaming, or that was the warm panting breath of a human
  being upon his cheek.</p>

  <p>He sprang up, with his arm stretched out as though to defend himself, and
  holding his breath; but there was no sound, save the dull murmur of whispered
  conversation around. One glance more at the cloud. How slowly it moved. Ah!
  thank God! the light was coming. Already the shadows were moving away. Voices
  were being raised; figures were becoming distinct; in a moment the moon would
  be free.</p>

  <p>It was all over. Laughing voices once more filled the air. The waiters
  were running about more busily than ever; people rubbed their eyes and joked
  about the darkness. But the Englishman sat quite still, holding in his hand a
  long, curiously-shaped dagger, which the first gleam of moonlight had shown
  him lying at his feet.</p>

  <p>He was no coward, but he gave a little shudder as he examined the thing,
  and felt its blueish steel edge with his finger. It was by no means a toy
  weapon; it had been fashioned and meant for use. What use? Somehow he felt
  that he had escaped a very great danger, as he put the thing thoughtfully
  into his pocket, and leaned back in his chair. The shrill voices and clatter
  of glasses around him sounded curiously unreal in his ears.</p>

  <p>By degrees he came to himself, and leaning forward took a match from the
  little marble table, and re-lit his cigar. Then, for the first time, he
  noticed with a start, that the chair opposite to him was occupied, occupied,
  too, by a figure which was perfectly familiar. It was the Sicilian who sat
  there, quietly smoking a long cigarette, and with his face shaded by the open
  palm of his hand.</p>

  <p>Lord St. Maurice made no sign of recognition. On the contrary, he turned
  his head away, preferring not to be seen. His nerves were already highly
  strung, and there seemed to him to be something ominous in this second
  meeting with the Sicilian. If he could have been sure of being able to do so
  unnoticed, he would have got up and gone into the hotel.</p>

  <p>"Good-evening, Signor!"</p>

  <p>Lord St. Maurice turned and looked into the white, corpse-like face of the
  Sicilian. It told its own story. There was trouble to come.</p>

  <p>"Good-evening, Signor," he answered quietly.</p>

  <p>The Sicilian leaned over the table. There were gray rims under his eyes,
  and even his lips had lost their color.</p>

  <p>"A week ago, Signor," he remarked, "we occupied these same seats
  here."</p>

  <p>"I remember it," Lord St. Maurice replied quietly.</p>

  <p>"It is well. It is of the events which have followed that night that I
  desire to speak, if you, Signor, will grant me a few moments of your
  time?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," the Englishman replied courteously. After all, perhaps the
  fellow did not mean to quarrel.</p>

  <p>"I regret exceedingly having to trouble you, Signor, with a little
  personal history," the Sicilian continued. "I must tell you, at the
  commencement, that for five years I have been a suitor for the hand of the
  Signorina Adrienne Cartuccio, my cousin."</p>

  <p>"Second cousin, I believe," Lord St. Maurice interposed.</p>

  <p>The Sicilian waved his hand. It was of no consequence.</p>

  <p>"Certain political differences with the Imperial party at Rome," he
  continued, "culminated two years ago in my banishment from Italy and Sicily.
  You, I believe, Lord St. Maurice, are of ancient family, and it is possible
  that you may understand to some extent the bitterness of exile from a country
  and a home which has been the seat of my family for nearly a thousand years.
  Such a sentence is not banishment as the world understands it; it is a living
  death! But, Signor, it was not all. It was not even the worst. Alas, that I,
  a Marioni, should live to confess it! But to be parted from the woman I love
  was even a sorer trial. Yet I endured it. I endured it; hoping against hope
  for a recall. My sister and I were orphans. She made her home with the
  Signorina Cartuccio. Thus I had news of her continually. Sometimes my cousin
  herself wrote to me. It was these letters which preserved my reason, and
  consciously or unconsciously, they breathed to me ever of hope.</p>

  <p>"Not Adrienne's, I'll swear," the Englishman muttered to himself. He was a
  true Briton, and there was plenty of dormant jealousy not very far from the
  surface.</p>

  <p>The Sicilian heard the words, and his eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>"The Signorina Cartuccio, if you please, Signor," he remarked coldly. "We
  are in a public place."</p>

  <p>Lord St. Maurice felt that he could afford to accept the rebuke, and he
  bowed his head.</p>

  <p>"My remark was not intended to be audible!" he declared.</p>

  <p>"For two years I bore with my wretched life," the Sicilian continued, "but
  at last my endurance came to an end. I determined to risk my liberty, that I
  might hear my fate from her own lips. I crossed the Alps without molestation,
  and even entered Rome. There I was watched, but not interfered with. The
  conclusion I came to was, that as long as I lived the life of an ordinary
  citizen, and showed no interest in politics, I was safe. I crossed to Palermo
  unharmed. I have seen the Signorina, and I have made my appeal."</p>

  <p>The Englishman dropped his eyes and knocked the ash from his cigar. The
  fellow was coming to the point at last.</p>

  <p>"You, Signor," the Sicilian continued, in a tone which, although it was no
  louder, seemed to gain in intensity from the smoldering passion underneath,
  "you, Signor, know what my answer was, for you were the cause. I have not
  told you this much of my story to win your pity; I simply tell it that I may
  reason with you. I have tried to make you understand something of the
  strength of my love for the Signorina. Do you think that, after what I have
  risked, after what I have suffered, that I shall stand aside, and see another
  man, an alien, take her from me? I come of a race, Signor, who are not used
  to see the women they love chosen for other men's wives. Have you ever heard
  of Count Hubert di Marioni, who, with seven hundred men, carried off a
  princess of Austria from her father's court, and brought her safely through
  Italy here to be one of the mothers of my race? It was five hundred years
  ago, and, among the ruins of ancient kingdoms, the Marionis have also fallen
  in estate. But the old spirit lingers. Lord St. Maurice, I am not a
  blood-thirsty man. I do not wish your life. Go back to your country, and
  choose for a bride one of her own daughters. Give up all thought of the
  Signorina di Cartuccio, or, as surely as the moon yonder looks down upon you
  and me, I shall kill you."</p>

  <p>Lord St. Maurice threw his cigar away and shrugged his shoulders. The
  affair was going to be serious, then.</p>

  <p>"You must forgive me, Signor, if I do not quite follow you," he said
  slowly. "The custom in our countries doubtless differs. In England it is the
  lady who chooses, and it is considered&mdash;pardon me&mdash;ill-mannered for
  a rejected suitor to have anything more to say."</p>

  <p>"As you remark, the ideas and customs of our countries differ," the
  Sicilian rejoined. "Here a nobleman of my descent would consider it an
  everlasting shame to stand quietly on one side, and see the woman whom he
  worshiped become the bride of another man, and that man an alien. He would be
  esteemed, and justly, a coward. Let us waste no more words, Signor. I have
  sought you to-night to put this matter plainly before you. Unless you leave
  this island, and give up your pretensions to the hand of the Signorina
  Cartuccio, you die. You have climbed for the last time to the Villa Fiolesse.
  Swear to go there no more; swear to leave this island before day breaks
  to-morrow, or your blood shall stain its shores. By the unbroken and sacred
  oath of a Marioni, I swear it!"</p>

  <p>To Lord St. Maurice, the Sicilian's words and gestures seemed only
  grotesque. He looked at him a little contemptuously&mdash;a thin, shrunken-up
  figure, ghastly pale, and seeming all the thinner on account of his somber
  black attire. What a husband for Adrienne! How had he dared to love so
  magnificent a creature. The very idea of such a man threatening him seemed
  absurd to Lord St. Maurice, an athlete of public school and college renown,
  with muscles like iron, and the stature of a guardsman. He was not angry, and
  he had not a particle of fear, but his stock of patience was getting
  exhausted.</p>

  <p>"How are you going to do the killing?" he asked. "Pardon my ignorance, but
  it is evidently one of the customs of the country which has not been
  explained to me. How do you manage it?"</p>

  <p>"I should kill you in a duel!" the Sicilian answered. "It would be easily
  done."</p>

  <p>The Englishman burst out laughing. It was too grotesque, almost like a
  huge joke.</p>

  <p>"Damn you and your duels!" he said, rising to his feet, and towering over
  his companion. "Look here, Mr. di Marioni, I've listened to you seriously
  because I felt heartily sorry for you; but I've had enough of it. I don't
  know whether you understand the slang of my country. If you do, you'll
  understand what I mean when I tell you that you've been talking 'bally rot.'
  We may be a rough lot, we Englishmen, but we're not cowards, and no one but a
  coward would dream of giving a girl up for such a tissue of whimperings. Be a
  man, sir, and get over it, and look here&mdash;none of this sort of
  business!"</p>

  <p>He drew the dagger from his breast pocket, and patted it. The Sicilian was
  speechless and livid with rage.</p>

  <p>"You are a coward!" he hissed. "You shall fight with me!"</p>

  <p>"That I won't," Lord St Maurice answered good-humoredly. "Just take my
  advice. Make up your mind that we both can't have her, and she's chosen me,
  and come and give me your hand like a man. Think it over, now, before the
  morning. Good-night!"</p>

  <p>The Sicilian sprang up, and looked rapidly around. At an adjoining table
  he recognized two men, and touched one on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Signors!" he cried, "and you, Signor le Capitaine, pardon me if I ask you
  for your hearing for an instant. This&mdash;gentleman here has insulted me,
  and declines to give me satisfaction. I have called him a coward and a
  rascal, and I repeat it! His name is Lord St Maurice. If he forfeits his
  right to be considered a gentleman, I demand that his name be struck off the
  visitors' club."</p>

  <p>The three men had risen to their feet. Two of them were gentlemen of the
  neighborhood with whom Lord St Maurice had a bowing acquaintance. The third
  was a French officer. They looked inquiringly at Lord St. Maurice.</p>

  <p>"It's quite true, gentlemen," he said with easy self-possession. "He's
  been calling me all the bad names under the sun, and I have declined to give
  him what he calls satisfaction. I haven't the least objection to your knowing
  it."</p>

  <p>The two Palermitans looked at one another doubtfully. The officer, giving
  his moustache a twist, stepped forward and bowed.</p>

  <p>"Might we inquire your reasons for declining the duel?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The Englishman shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he answered. "In the first place, I am an officer in the
  service of Her Majesty the Queen, and duelling is strictly forbidden; in the
  second, Signor di Marioni is too excited to know what he is talking
  about."</p>

  <p>"In England, Signor, your first objection is valid; here, it is scarcely
  so. As to the latter, Monsieur le Count seems now to be perfectly composed. I
  am on the committee of the club, and I fear that I must erase your name if
  you persist in your refusal."</p>

  <p>"I don't care two straws about your club," Lord St. Maurice answered
  carelessly. "As for the duel, I decline it, once and for all. We Englishmen
  have a code of honor of our own, and it is more to us than the custom of the
  countries which we chance to visit. I wish you good-night, gentlemen."</p>

  <p>They fell back, impressed in spite of themselves by the coolness and
  hauteur of his words. Suddenly, with the swiftness of a tiger-cat, the
  Sicilian leaped forward and struck the Englishman on the cheek.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you will tell us all, Signor, how the men of your country resent
  an insult such as that," he cried.</p>

  <p>Every one turned round at the sound of the scuffle. The eyes of all were
  upon the Englishman, who stood there, head and shoulders above all the crowd,
  with blazing eyes and pale cheeks. He was in a towering passion, but his
  voice never shook or faltered.</p>

  <p>"You shall see for yourself, Signor!" he cried.</p>

  <p>The Sicilian struggled, but he was like a child in the Englishman's arms.
  He had caught him up in a vice-like grasp, and held him high over the heads
  of the astonished onlookers. For a moment he seemed as though he were going
  to throw him right out of the restaurant on to the Marina, but at the last
  moment he changed his mind, and with a contemptuous gesture set him down in
  the midst of them, breathless and choking.</p>

  <p>"You can send your seconds as soon as you like," he said shortly.
  "Good-evening, gentlemen."</p>

  <p>They fell back before him like sheep, leaving a broad way right into the
  hotel, through which he passed, stern and self-possessed. The Sicilian
  watched him curiously, with twitching lips.</p>

  <p>"There goes a brave man," whispered one of the Palermitans to the French
  officer. "But his days are numbered."</p>

  <p>The Frenchman gazed at the Sicilian and nodded. There was death in his
  face.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chIX"
     id="chIX"></a>IX.&mdash; "AH! WHY SHOULD LOVE..."</h2>

  <p class="verse">Ah! why should love, like men in drinking songs<br>
  Spice his fair banquet with the dust of earth?</p>

  <p class="first">Lord St. Maurice walked straight into his room without
  perceiving that it was already occupied. He flung his hat into a corner, and
  himself into an easy-chair, with an exclamation which was decidedly
  unparliamentary.</p>

  <p>"D&mdash;n!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"That's a lively greeting," remarked a voice from the other end of the
  room.</p>

  <p>He looked quickly up. A tall figure loomed out of the shadows of the
  apartment, and presently resolved itself into the figure of a man with his
  hands in his pockets, and a huge meerschaum pipe in his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Briscoe, by Jove! How long have you been here?"</p>

  <p>"About two hours. I've been resting. Anything wrong downstairs? Thought I
  heard a row."</p>

  <p>"Strike a light, there's a good fellow, and I'll tell you."</p>

  <p>The new-comer moved to the window, and pulled aside the curtain.</p>

  <p>"Moon's good enough," he remarked. "I hate those sickly candles. Great
  Scott! what's the matter with you? You look as black as thunder."</p>

  <p>Lord St. Maurice told him the whole story. Martin Briscoe listened without
  remark until he had finished. Then he pushed the tobacco firmly down into the
  bowl of his pipe and re-lit it, smoking for a few minutes in silence.</p>

  <p>"I tell you what, Maurice," he said at length, "of all the blood-thirsty
  little devils that ever were hatched, that Marioni takes the cake. Why, I'm
  going to fight him myself to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>"What!" cried St. Maurice, starting up in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Fact, I assure you. Margharita told me that he was going to be
  troublesome, but I'd no idea that he was such a little spitfire. I landed two
  hours ago, and came straight here. I'd scarcely had a tub, and made myself
  decent, when in the little beggar walks, and kicks up no end of a row. I
  listened for a bit, and then told him to go to hell. In five minutes he'd got
  the whole thing arranged, seconds and all. To-morrow morning, at 6.30, on the
  sands, 'll see me a dead man, if he can use his tools as well as he can talk,
  little beast."</p>

  <p>"Briscoe, this is a horrible mess," Lord St. Maurice declared
  emphatically. "I don't know what you think of duels; I hate them."</p>

  <p>"It isn't duels I hate, it's the being spitted," Briscoe answered
  gloomily. "I can fence a bit, but it's always been with foils. I'm not used
  to swords, and I expect that fellow is a regular 'don' at it. There's a sort
  of corpse-like look about him, anyway. Got any 'baccy, St. Maurice? Mine's so
  beastly dry."</p>

  <p>"Help yourself, old fellow. Who the devil's that?"</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door, and one of the servants of the hotel
  appeared. With some difficulty, for he was a native, and spoke French
  execrably, he explained that there were some gentlemen below who desired to
  speak with Lord St. Maurice.</p>

  <p>The two men exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>"My time has come, you see," Lord St Maurice remarked grimly. "Wait for
  me."</p>

  <p>In the deserted <i>salle &agrave; manger</i> the French officer and one of the
  Palermitan gentlemen were talking together. The latter approached Lord St.
  Maurice and drew him on one side.</p>

  <p>"I do not know how you may be situated here for friends, Lord St.
  Maurice," he said, "but I felt that you would only consider it courteous of
  me to offer my services to you in case you are without a second in this
  affair. My father wrote to me from Rome of your visit here, and I went to
  your yacht to call this afternoon. My name is Pruccio&mdash;Signor Adriano
  Pruccio."</p>

  <p>Lord Maurice bowed.</p>

  <p>"I remember your father quite well," he said, "and I am glad to commence
  our acquaintance by accepting the favor you offer. Will you be so good as to
  make all the necessary arrangements with the Count Marioni's second, and let
  me know the result."</p>

  <p>The Palermitan withdrew into a corner of the room with the Frenchman, and
  a few minutes' whispered conversation took place between them. Then he
  rejoined Lord St. Maurice, who was standing at the window.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to say that Count Marioni, who is the insulted person in this
  affair, chooses swords."</p>

  <p>Lord St. Maurice nodded.</p>

  <p>"When, and where?"</p>

  <p>"At a place below the cliffs to which I shall conduct you at six o'clock
  to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>"At six o'clock! But he has another affair on at half-past."</p>

  <p>"So I understand," the Palermitan answered, "I pointed out that we should
  prefer an interval of at least a day; but Monsieur le Capitaine there
  explains that the Count de Marioni, having dispensed with his incognito, is
  hourly in danger of arrest on account of some political trouble, and is
  therefore anxious to have both affairs settled. I have agreed, therefore,
  with your permission, to waive all etiquette in the matter."</p>

  <p>"I don't know that it makes any difference to me," Lord St. Maurice
  answered. "To-night, by moonlight, would have suited me best."</p>

  <p>Signor Pruccio laughed.</p>

  <p>"You are in a great hurry, Lord St. Maurice. May I ask whether you are
  proficient with your weapon?"</p>

  <p>"I never fenced since I was at school," he answered coolly. "I suppose
  Marioni is dangerous?"</p>

  <p>The Palermitan looked very grave. He began to see that it would be more
  like a murder than a duel.</p>

  <p>"Count Marioni is one of the finest swordsmen in Italy," he answered.
  "Perhaps, if I were to explain that you are not accustomed to the
  rapier&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pray don't," Lord St. Maurice interrupted. "He'd be just as likely to
  shoot me."</p>

  <p>"That is true," Signor Pruccio assented. "I have seen him do wonderful
  things with the pistol. If you can spare an hour or two, Signor, I should be
  happy to give you a little advice as to the management of your weapon. There
  is a large room at the top of my house where we fence."</p>

  <p>Lord St. Maurice shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, I'll take my chance," he answered.</p>

  <p>"At five o'clock, Signor. Will you not come to my house for the
  night?"</p>

  <p>"I'm much obliged, but I must write some letters. Good-night, Signor."</p>

  <p>"Good-night, Signor. Sleep well!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The golden light died out of the waning moon, and afar off
  in the east a long line of red clouds seemed to rise out of the sea. The air
  was still and calm and breathless. Even the sea seemed hushed as the yellow
  stars faded from the sky. Behind that bank of glowing clouds was the promise
  of the richer and fuller day. Amber was becoming golden, and pink purple,
  till through a very rainbow of coloring the sun's first rays shot across the
  chilled waters.</p>

  <p>Lord St. Maurice had fallen asleep, with his head resting upon his arms,
  close to the open window. By his side, with the ink scarcely dry upon either,
  were his will, and his farewell letter to Adrienne. No one but himself would
  ever know the agony, the hopeless grief, which had rent his heart, as word
  after word, sentence after sentence of passionate leave-taking had found
  their way on to those closely-written sheets of paper. But it was over
  now&mdash;over and done with. When some faint sound from below, or a breath
  of the morning breeze from the bosom of the sea awoke him, and he commenced
  making a few preparations for the start, he was surprised to find how calm he
  was. The passion of his grief had spent itself. He thought of those hours
  before sleep had fallen upon him with horror, but they seemed to him very far
  away. He was face to face with death, but he felt only that he was about to
  make a journey into an undiscovered land. His imagination was dulled. He
  remembered only that he was going out to meet death, and it behoved him to
  meet it as an honorable English gentleman.</p>

  <p>He plunged his head into a basin of cold water and made a careful
  toilette, not forgetting even the button-hole which Adrienne had fetched for
  him with her own fingers on the evening before. Then he quietly left the
  hotel, and walked slowly up and down the Marina until Signor Pruccio
  arrived.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chX"
     id="chX"></a>X.&mdash;A MARIONI'S OATH</h2>

  <p class="first">Two men stood facing one another on a narrow belt of sand,
  stripped to the shirt, and with rapiers in their hands. One was the Sicilian,
  Leonardo di Marioni, the other the Englishman, Lord St. Maurice. Their
  attitude spoke for itself. They were about to fight for each other's
  life.</p>

  <p>It was a fair spot which their two seconds had chosen to stain with
  bloodshed. Close almost to their feet, the blue waters of the Mediterranean,
  glistening in the early morning sunlight, broke in tiny, rippling waves upon
  the firm white sand. Inland was a semi-circle of steep cliffs, at the base of
  which there were great bowlders of rock, fern-covered and with hyacinths of
  many colors growing out of the crevices, and lending a sweet fragrance to the
  fresh morning air. It was a spot shut off from the world, for the towering
  cliffs ran out into the sea on either side, completely enclosing the little
  cove. There was only one possible approach to it, save by boat, and that a
  difficult and tedious one, and, looking upward from the shore, hard to
  discover. But on the northward side the cliffs suddenly dropped, and in the
  deft was a thick plantation of aloes, through which a winding path led down
  to the beach.</p>

  <p>Perhaps of all the little group gathered down there to witness and take
  part in the coming tragedy, Signor Pruccio, Lord St. Maurice's second, was
  looking the most disturbed and anxious. His man, he knew, must fall, and an
  ugly sickening dread was in his heart. It was so like a murder. He pictured
  to himself that fair boyish face&mdash;and in the clear morning sunlight the
  young Englishman's face showed marvelously few signs of the night of agony
  through which he had passed&mdash;ghastly and livid, with the stamp of death
  upon the forehead, and the deep blue eyes glazed and dull. It was an awful
  thing, yet what could he do? What hope was there? Leonardo di Marioni he knew
  to be a famous swordsman; Lord St. Maurice had never fenced since he had left
  Eton, and scarcely remembered the positions. It was doubtful even whether he
  had ever held a rapier. But what Signor Pruccio feared most was the pale,
  unflinching hate in the Sicilian's white face. He loathed it, and yet it
  fascinated him. He knew, alas! how easily, by one swift turn of the wrist, he
  would be able to pass his sword through the Englishman's body, mocking at his
  unskilled defense. He fancied that he could see the arms thrown up to heaven,
  the fixed, wild eyes, the red blood spurting out from the wound and staining
  the virgin earth; almost he fancied that he could hear the death-cry break
  from those agonized white lips. Horrible effort of the imagination! What evil
  chance had made him offer his services to this young English lord, and
  dragged him into assisting at a duel which could be but a farce&mdash;worse
  than a farce, a murder? He would have given half his fortune for an
  earthquake to have come and swallowed up that merciless Sicilian.</p>

  <p>A few yards away Martin Briscoe was standing with his second. He and Lord
  St. Maurice, at this tragical moment of their lives, had been nearer a
  quarrel than ever before. Briscoe, with some justice, had claimed priority
  with the Sicilian, and had maintained his right in the face of Lord St.
  Maurice's opposition. But the Sicilian had stepped in, and insisted upon his
  privilege to decide for himself whom he should first meet. The times had been
  distinctly stated, he reminded them, six o'clock by Lord St. Maurice's
  second, and half-past six by Mr. Briscoe's. He had arranged it so with a
  definite purpose, and he claimed that it should be carried out. There was no
  appeal from his decision. He was in the right, and Martin Briscoe, with a
  dull red glow of anger in his homely rugged cheeks, had been forced to retire
  and become a most unwilling spectator of what he feared could only be a
  butchery.</p>

  <p>Signor Pruccio had delayed the duel as long as he could, under the pretext
  of waiting for the doctor who had been instructed to follow them, but who had
  not yet arrived. Twice the Sicilian had urged that they should commence, and
  each time he had pleaded that they might wait for a few minutes longer. To
  enter upon a duel <i>&agrave; l'outrance</i>, save in the presence of a medical man,
  was a thing unheard of, he declared. But at last this respite was exhausted,
  for the opposing second, with a pleasant smile, had remarked that he himself
  was skilled in surgery, and would be happy to officiate should any necessity
  arise. There was no longer any excuse. Lord St. Maurice himself insisted upon
  the signal being given. Sadly therefore he prepared to give it. Already both
  men had fallen into position. The word trembled upon his lips.</p>

  <p>A flock of sea-birds flew screaming over their heads, and he waited a
  moment until they should have passed. Then he raised his hand.</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>The cry was a woman's. They all looked round. Only a few yards away from
  them stood Adrienne, her fair hair streaming loose in the morning breeze, and
  her gown torn and soiled. She had just issued from the sloping aloe
  plantation, and was trembling in every limb from the speed of her
  descent.</p>

  <p>The cloud on the Sicilian's face grew black as night.</p>

  <p>"This is no sight for you to look upon!" he cried, between his teeth. "You
  will not save your lover by waiting. You had better go, or I will kill him
  before your eyes!"</p>

  <p>She walked calmly between them, and looked from one to the other.</p>

  <p>"Lord St. Maurice, I need not ask you, I know! This duel is not of your
  seeking?"</p>

  <p>"It is not!" he answered, lowering his sword. "This fellow insulted me,
  and I punished him publicly in the restaurant of the Hotel de l'Europe last
  night. In my opinion, that squared matters, but he demanded satisfaction, and
  from his point of view, I suppose he has a right to it. I am quite ready to
  give it to him."</p>

  <p>The seconds had fallen back. They three were alone. She went up to the
  Sicilian and laid her hand upon his arm.</p>

  <p>"Leonardo, we have been friends, have we not? Why should you seek to do
  that which will make us enemies for ever? I have broken no faith with you; I
  never gave you one word of hope. I never loved you; I never could have loved
  you! Why should you seek to murder the man whom I do love, and make me
  miserable for ever?"</p>

  <p>His face was ghastly, but he showed no sign of being moved by her
  words.</p>

  <p>"Bah! You talk as you feel&mdash;just now!" he said quickly. "I tell you
  that I do not believe one word. If he had not come between us, you would have
  been mine some day. Love like mine would have conquered in the end. Away!
  away!" he cried, pushing her back in growing excitement, and stamping on the
  ground with his feet. "The sight of you only maddens me, and nerves my arm to
  kill! Though you beg on your knees for his life, that man shall die!"</p>

  <p>"I shall not beg upon my knees," she answered proudly. "Yet, Leonardo, for
  your own sake, for the sake of your own happiness, I bid you once more
  consider. You would stain your hand with the blood of the man who is more to
  me than you can ever be. Is this what you call love? Leonardo, beware! I am
  not a woman to be lightly robbed of what is dear to me. Put up your sword, or
  you will repent it to your dying day."</p><a id="picNNN"
        name="picNNN"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">"Put up your sword, or you will repent it:"</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Her voice rang out clear and threatening upon the morning stillness, and
  her eyes were flashing with anger. It was a wonderful tableau which had
  grouped itself upon that little strip of sand.</p>

  <p>The Sicilian was unmoved. The sight of the woman he loved championing his
  foe seemed to madden him.</p>

  <p>"Out of my way!" he cried, grasping his sword firmly. "Lord St. Maurice,
  are you not weary of skulking behind a woman's petticoats? On guard! I say.
  On guard!"</p>

  <p>She suddenly flung her hands above her head, and there was what seemed to
  be a miraculous increase in the little group. Three men in plain, dark
  clothes sprang from behind a gigantic bowlder, and, in an instant, the
  Sicilian was seized from behind.</p>

  <p>He looked around at his captors, pale and furious. They were strangers to
  him. As yet, he did not realize what had happened.</p>

  <p>"What does this mean?" he cried furiously. "Who dares to lay hands upon
  me? We are on free ground!"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Leonardo, you have brought this upon yourself," she said, firmly but
  compassionately. "You plotted to murder the man I love. I warned you that, to
  protect him, there was nothing which I would not dare. Only a moment ago I
  gave you another chance. One word from you and I would have thrown these
  papers into the sea," producing a packet from her bosom, "rather than have
  placed them where I do now!"</p>

  <p>A fourth man had strolled out of the aloe grove, smoking a long cigarette.
  Into his hands Adrienne had placed the little packet of letters, which he
  accepted with a low bow.</p>

  <p>Even now the Sicilian felt bewildered; but as his eyes fell upon the
  fourth man he started and trembled violently, gazing at him as though
  fascinated.</p>

  <p>"I do not understand!" he faltered.</p>

  <p>The fourth man removed his cigarette from his teeth and produced a
  paper.</p>

  <p>"Permit me to explain," he said politely. "I have here a warrant for your
  arrest, Count di Marioni, alias Leonardo di Cortegi, on two counts: first,
  that you, being an exile, have returned to Italian soil; and secondly, on a
  further and separate charge of conspiracy against the Italian Government, in
  collusion with a secret society, calling themselves 'Members of the Order of
  the White Hyacinth.' The proofs of the latter conspiracy, which were wanting
  at your first trial, have now been furnished."</p>

  <p>He touched the little roll of papers which he had just received, and, with
  a low bow, fell back. There was an ominous silence.</p>

  <p>At the mention of his first name a deathlike pallor had swept in upon the
  Sicilian's face. His manner suddenly became quite quiet and free from
  excitement. But there was a look in his dark eyes more awful than had been
  his previous fury.</p>

  <p>"You have done a brave thing indeed, Adrienne!" he said slowly. "You have
  saved your lover. You have betrayed the man who would have given his life to
  serve you. Listen to me! As I loved you before so do I hate you now! As my
  love for you in the past has governed my life, and brought me always to your
  side, so in the days to come shall my undying hate for you and for that man
  shape my actions and mold my life, and bring me over sea and land to the
  farthest corners of the earth to wreak my vengeance upon you. Be it ten, or
  twenty, or thirty years, they keep me rotting in their prisons, the time will
  come when I shall be free again; and then, beware! Search your memory for the
  legends of our race! Was ever a hate forgotten, or an oath broken? Hear me
  swear," he cried, raising his clasped hands above his head with a sudden
  passionate gesture, "by the sun, and the sky, and the sea, and the earth, I
  swear that, as they continue unchanged and unchanging, so shall my hate for
  you remain! Ah! you can take your lover's hand, traitress, and think to find
  protection there. But in your heart I read your fear. The day shall come when
  you shall kneel at my feet for mercy, and there shall be no mercy. Gentlemen,
  my sword. I am at your service."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chXI"
     id="chXI"></a>XI.&mdash;A MEETING OF THE ORDER</h2>

  <p class="first">A man in a fur-lined overcoat&mdash;thin, shrunken, and
  worn&mdash;stood on the pavement in a little street in Camberwell, looking
  about him in evident disgust. Before him stretched a long row of six-roomed
  houses, smoke-begrimed, hideously similar, hideously commonplace. The street
  was empty save for the four-wheeled cab from which he had just alighted, and
  which was now vanishing in a slight fog, a milkman and a greengrocer's boy in
  amicable converse, and a few dirty children playing in the gutter. Nothing
  could be more depressing, or more calculated to unfavorably impress a
  stranger from a southern land visiting the great city for the first time. It
  was a picture of suburban desolation, the home of poverty-stricken
  philistinism, uncaring and uncared for. In Swinburne's words, though with a
  different meaning, one saw there, without the necessity of further travel, "a
  land that was lonelier than ruin."</p>

  <p>The little old man who had alighted from the cab, stood for a moment or
  two looking helplessly around, half surprised at what he saw, half disgusted.
  Such monotonous and undeviating ugliness was a thing which he had never
  dreamed of&mdash;certainly he had never encountered anything like it. Was it
  possible that he had made a mistake in the address? He drew a scrap of paper
  from his pocket and consulted it again. The address was written there plainly
  enough&mdash;85, Eden Street, Camberwell. He was certainly in Eden Street,
  Camberwell, and the figures on the gate-post opposite him, worn and black
  with dirt, were unmistakably an eight and a five. With a little shudder he
  pushed open the gate, and walked through the narrow strip of untidy garden to
  the front door. The bell he found broken and useless, so he knocked softly at
  first, and then louder against the worn panels.</p>

  <p>It was some time before an answer came. Several of the neighbors appeared
  upon their doorsteps, and took bold and somewhat ribald stock of the visitor.
  A young person of eighty-one, who was considered the wit of the neighborhood,
  made several very audible remarks, which produced a chorus of gigglings, on
  the subject of his clothes and foreign appearance. But he stood there as
  though he had been deaf, his hands thrust down into the loose pockets of his
  overcoat and his deep-sunken eyes fixed wistfully but not impatiently upon
  the closed door. He was a mute picture of resignation.</p>

  <p>At last, after his third summons, the door was slowly and cautiously
  opened, and the astonished visitor beheld, for the first time in his life, a
  London maid-of-all-work. The astonishment seemed perfectly mutual. He, with
  his parchment dried face, white hair and eyebrows, and piercing black eyes
  only a little dimmed by time, muffled up to the throat in furs, and
  unmistakably a foreigner, was as strange to her as her appearance was to him.
  He looked at her black hands, her face besmeared with dirt, and with her
  uncombed hair hanging loose around it, at the tattered and soiled print gown
  looped up on one side and held together on the other by pins, and at the
  white-stockinged feet showing through the holes in her boots. What an object
  it was! It was fortunate for him that the twilight and fog concealed,
  partially at any rate, the disgust in his face.</p>

  <p>"Is&mdash;Mr. Bartlezzi in?" he inquired, as soon as he could find words
  to speak at all.</p>

  <p>"Lawk-a-mussy! I dunno," the girl answered in blank bewilderment. "He
  don't have no visitors, he don't. You ain't taxes, are you?"</p>

  <p>"No!" he answered, somewhat at a venture, for he did not catch her
  meaning.</p>

  <p>"Nor water rate? No, you ain't the water rate," she continued,
  meditatively. "I knows him. He wears a brown billycock and glasses, 'e does,
  and I see him walking with Mary Ann Stubbins on a Sunday."</p>

  <p>He admitted doubtfully that she was correct He was not the water rate.</p>

  <p>It began to dawn upon her that it would be safe to admit him into the
  house.</p>

  <p>"Just yer come hinside, will yer," she said. "I dunno who yer are, but I
  guess you ain't nothink to be afraid of. Come hinside."</p>

  <p>She opened the door and admitted him into a dark, narrow passage. He had
  to squeeze himself against the wall to allow her to pass him. Then she
  surveyed him critically again, with her arms akimbo and her head a little on
  one side.</p>

  <p>"I reckon you've got a name," she surmised. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"You can tell Mr. Bartlezzi that a gentleman from abroad desires to speak
  with him," he answered. "My name is immaterial. Will you accept this?" he
  added, holding out a half-crown timidly toward her.</p>

  <p>She grabbed it from him, and turned it over incredulously in the
  semi-darkness. There was no deception about it; it was indeed a
  half-crown&mdash;the first she had ever been given in her life.</p>

  <p>She dropped a rude sort of curtsey, and, opening the door of a room, half
  ushered, half pushed him in. Then she went to the foot of the stairs, the
  coin tightly clinched in her hand, and he heard her call
  out&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Master! There's a gent here from furrin parts has wants you, which 'is
  name his immaterial. 'E's in the parlor."</p>

  <p>There was a growl in reply, and then silence. The handmaiden, her duty
  discharged, shuffled off to the lower regions. The visitor was left
  alone.</p>

  <p>He looked around him in deep and increasing disgust. The walls of the
  little room into which he had been shown were bare, save for a few cheap
  chromos and glaring oleographs of the sort distributed by grocers and petty
  tradespeople at Christmas. A cracked looking-glass, with a dirty gilt frame,
  tottered upon the mantelpiece. The furniture was scanty, and of the
  public-house pattern, and there was a strong nauseous odor of stale tobacco
  smoke and beer. A small piano stood in one corner, the cheapest of its kind,
  and maintaining an upright position only by means of numerous props. One leg
  tilted in the air was supported by two old and coverless volumes of a novel,
  and another was casterless. The carpet was worn into shreds, and there was no
  attempt to conceal or mend the huge ravages which time had made in it. The
  ceiling was cracked and black with smoke, and the faded paper was hanging
  down from the top of the wall. There was not a single article or spot in the
  room on which the eye could rest with pleasure. It was an interior which
  matched the exterior. Nothing worse could be said about it.</p>

  <p>The visitor took it all in, and raising his hand to his head closed his
  eyes. Ah! what a relief it was to blot it all out of sight, if only for a
  moment. He had known evil times, but at their worst, such surroundings as
  these he had never met with. A strange nervousness was creeping slowly over
  him, the presage of disappointment. He dropped his hands, and walked
  restlessly up and down, striving to banish his fears. Might not all this be
  necessary&mdash;a form of disguise&mdash;a clever mode of concealment?
  Poverty alone could not have brought things to this strait. Poverty! There
  had been no poverty in his day. Yet he was full of forebodings. He remembered
  the wonder, the evasions, almost the pity with which his first inquiries in
  Rome had been met. He could not expect to find things exactly the same.
  Twenty years is a long time, and there must be many changes. Why had he not
  stayed in Rome a little longer, and learned more. He could easily have
  obtained the knowledge which he desired there. It would have been wiser,
  surely it would have been wiser.</p>

  <p>The door opened in the midst of his meditations, and he looked eagerly up.
  Again his heart fell. It was not such a man as this that he had expected to
  see. Ah! what a day of disappointments it was!</p>

  <p>The figure which, after a moment's pause in the doorway, now advanced
  somewhat hesitatingly toward him, was that of a man a little past middle age.
  He was of medium height, but stout even to corpulency, and his cheeks were
  fat and puffy. His hair was gray, and his thick, stubbly mustaches, which had
  evidently once been black, were also changing color. His dark, shiny coat was
  ridiculously short for him, and his trousers terminated above his ankles. He
  wore no necktie, and his collar was ragged and soiled. In short, his whole
  appearance was not only untidy but dirty. His gait, too, was slouching and
  undignified.</p>

  <p>"You wished to speak to me," he said in a thick tone and with a foreign
  accent. "My name is Bartlezzi&mdash;Signor Alfonso Bartlezzi."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I wished to speak with you."</p>

  <p>Signor Bartlezzi began to feel uncomfortable under his visitor's fixed
  gaze. Why should he look at him so intently? He had never set eyes upon him
  before&mdash;and what an odd, shrunken little figure it was. He coughed and
  shifted his position.</p>

  <p>"Ah! yes. I am ready, as you see. Is it anything to do with my
  profession?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know what your profession is."</p>

  <p>Signor Bartlezzi made an effort to draw himself up, and assumed a military
  air.</p>

  <p>"I am a master of fencing," he announced, "also a professor of
  Italian&mdash;Professor Alfonso Bartlezzi, at your service. I am fairly
  well-known in this neighborhood. If you have pupils to recommend, sir, or if
  you are thinking of taking lessons yourself, I should be most happy. My
  services are sometimes made use of as interpreter, both in the police court
  and privately. I should be happy to serve you in that capacity, sir."</p>

  <p>Signor Bartlezzi, having declared himself, folded his arms and waited. He
  felt certain that his visitor must now divulge his name and mission. That,
  however, he seemed in no hurry to do.</p>

  <p>"You are an Italian?" he asked presently.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

  <p>"May I ask, have you still correspondents or friends in that country?"</p>

  <p>The Professor was a little uneasy. He looked steadfastly at his visitor
  for a moment, however, and seemed to regain his composure.</p>

  <p>"I have neither," he answered sorrowfully. "The friends of former days are
  silent; they have forgotten me."</p>

  <p>"You have lived in England for long, then?"</p>

  <p>"Since I was a boy, sir."</p>

  <p>"And you are content?"</p>

  <p>The Professor shrugged his shoulders and looked round. The gesture was
  significant.</p>

  <p>"Scarcely so," he answered. "But what would you have? May I now ask you a
  question, sir?" he continued.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Your name?"</p>

  <p>His visitor looked around him mournfully.</p>

  <p>"The day for secrecy is past, I suppose," he said sadly. "I am the Count
  Leonardo di Marioni."</p>

  <p>"What!" shrieked the Professor.</p>

  <p>"Count Leonardo di Marioni&mdash;that is my name. I am better known as
  Signor di Cortegi, perhaps, in the history of our society."</p>

  <p>"My God!"</p>

  <p>If a thunderbolt had burst through the ceiling of the little sitting room,
  the Professor could not have been more agitated. He had sunk down upon a
  chair, pale and shaking all over with the effect of the surprise.</p>

  <p>"He was a young man?" he faltered.</p>

  <p>His visitor sighed.</p>

  <p>"It was five-and-twenty years ago," he answered slowly. "Five-and-twenty
  years rotting in a Roman prison. That has been my fate. I was a young man
  then. You see me now."</p>

  <p>He held up his arms, and let them drop again heavily to his side. It was a
  gesture full of sad dramatic pathos, but in that little room there was no one
  to observe it, no one to pity him for those white hairs and deep-drawn lines.
  But that was nothing. It was not pity that he wanted.</p>

  <p>There was silence. Both men were absorbed in their own thoughts. Signor
  Bartlezzi was thunderstruck and completely unnerved. The perspiration stood
  out upon his forehead, and he could feel his hands and legs shaking. This was
  a terrible and altogether unexpected blow to him. It was not the thought of
  that twenty-five years' lonely captivity which was oppressing him, so much as
  the fact that it was over&mdash;that the day of release had come, and that it
  was indeed Count Marioni who stood before him, alive and a free man. That was
  the serious part of it. Had it not been proclaimed that the imprisonment was
  for life? That had certainly been the sentence. A gleam of hope flashed in
  upon him. Perhaps he had escaped from prison. If so, the sooner he was back
  there the better.</p>

  <p>"Was not the sentence for life?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>The Count assented, shaking his head slowly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, for life," he answered bitterly. "That was the sentence,
  imprisonment for life."</p>

  <p>"Then you have escaped?"</p>

  <p>The same slow shake of the head. The Professor was bitterly
  disappointed.</p>

  <p>"No. At five-and-twenty years a prisoner with a good-conduct sheet is
  restored to liberty. My time came at last. It was a weary while."</p>

  <p>"What evil fate kept him alive all that time?" the Professor muttered
  under his breath. "Men are buried deep who pass within the walls of an
  Italian prison. What had kept this frail old man alive?" Before the night was
  over, he knew!</p>

  <p>The Professor sat on the edge of his chair, limp and dejected. He was
  quite powerless to frame any speech of welcome or congratulation.
  Fortunately, it was not expected. His visitor was deep in thought, and some
  time passed before he appeared even to notice the presence of Signor
  Bartlezzi. At last, however, he looked up and spoke.</p>

  <p>"I fear that all things have not gone well with us!" he said sadly. "On my
  release, I visited the old home of our society in the Piazza di Spiola at
  Rome. It was broken up. I met with no one who could tell me anything about
  it. It was doubtless because I knew not where to go; but I had
  fancied&mdash;I had hoped&mdash;that there might have been some one whose
  memory would not have been altogether dulled by time, who would have come to
  meet me at the prison gates, and welcome me back into the living world once
  more. But that is nothing. Doubtless the day of my release was unknown. It
  was the hot season at Rome, and I wandered wearily about, seeing no familiar
  face, and unable to hear anything of our friends. I might have had patience
  and lingered, but it seemed to me that I had been patient so long&mdash;it
  was all exhausted. From there I went to Florence, with the same result. At
  last I came to London, and by making cautious inquiries through my bank, I
  discovered your address. So I have come here."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes, yes," answered the Professor, with blinking eyes, and still
  completely bewildered. "You have come here. Just so. Just so."</p>

  <p>"The numbers have fallen off, I suppose? Yet you still have meetings?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes; certainly. We still have meetings," the Professor assented
  spasmodically.</p>

  <p>The little old man nodded his head gravely. He had never doubted it.</p>

  <p>"When is the next?" he asked, with the first touch of eagerness creeping
  into his voice.</p>

  <p>Signor Bartlezzi felt a cold perspiration on his forehead, and slowly
  mopped it with a red cotton handkerchief. The calmness of despair was
  settling down upon him. "He must know," he thought. "Better get it over."</p>

  <p>"To-night," he answered, "in an hour&mdash;perhaps before. They'll be
  dropping in directly."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" It was a long-drawn and significant monosyllable. The Count rose to
  his feet, and commenced pacing the room. Already its meanness was forgotten,
  its narrow walls had expanded. The day of his desire had come. "What are your
  numbers now?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The Professor drew a long breath, and kept his eyes fixed upon his
  visitor. The thing was narrowing down.</p>

  <p>"Four," he answered; "four besides myself."</p>

  <p>The Count started and appeared perplexed.</p>

  <p>"Four on the acting committee, you mean, I suppose?" he suggested. "Four
  is the old number."</p>

  <p>The Professor shook his head doggedly.</p>

  <p>"Four altogether," he repeated.</p>

  <p>The old man's eyes flashed, but the angry light died almost immediately
  away. After all, there might be grave reasons, of which he was ignorant, for
  restricting the number.</p>

  <p>"Four desperate and brave men may be much," he mused, half aloud. "One
  will do enough for my purpose."</p>

  <p>There was a ghastly humor in that speech which was nearly too much for
  Signor Bartlezzi. He was within an ace of collapsing, but he saved himself by
  a quick glance at that worn old man. His visitor was living in the light of
  five-and-twenty years ago. The awakening would come. It was at hand.</p>

  <p>"Signor Bartlezzi," the Count said, pausing suddenly in his restless walk,
  "I have a confession to make."</p>

  <p>"So had he," Signor Bartlezzi mused, though his would keep.</p>

  <p>"Proceed," he begged, with a wave of his hand and a touch of his old
  bombast, which had collapsed so suddenly. "Proceed, I am all attention."</p>

  <p>The Count stood in the middle of the room, with his left hand thrust into
  the bosom of his coat, and the right stretched out toward the Professor. It
  was his old attitude of bygone days into which he had unconsciously fallen,
  but his expression was no longer threatening, and his voice, though indeed it
  quivered, was free from the passion and fire of his youth. He was apologetic
  now, rather than denunciatory. It was a great change.</p>

  <p>"You will doubtless imagine, Signor Bartlezzi," he said, "from my presence
  here, from my seeking you out immediately upon my release, that the old fires
  burn still in my heart; that my enthusiasm for the cause still survives the
  chill of five-and-twenty years. Alas! that I should confess it, but it is not
  so!"</p>

  <p>"Then what the mischief does he want here?" mused the Professor. "An
  account of his money, I suppose. Oh, damn those meddlesome Italians who set
  him free."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, but it is natural," he remarked aloud, wagging his head
  sagely. "Five-and-twenty years is a devil of a time!"</p>

  <p>"You will not misunderstand me, Professor," he went on almost pleadingly.
  "You will not imagine for one moment that the 'Order of the White Hyacinth'
  and everything connected with it, is not still dear to me, very dear. I am an
  old man, and my time for usefulness is past. Yet there is one demand which I
  have to make of the association which I have faithfully served and suffered
  for. Doubtless you know full well what I mean. Will you hear it now, or shall
  I wait and lay it before the meeting to-night?"</p>

  <p>"The latter, by all means," begged the Professor hastily. "They wouldn't
  like it if you told me first. They'd feel hurt, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>The Count bowed his head.</p>

  <p>"So be it, then," he said gravely.</p>

  <p>There was a short silence. The Professor, with his thumbs in his
  waistcoat, gazed fixedly down the street.</p>

  <p>"I don't see why they shouldn't share the storm," he mused. "He's small,
  but he looks as though he might be awkward. I would very much rather Martello
  and the others were here; Martello is a strong man."</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the outside door, and Signor Bartlezzi peered through
  the window.</p>

  <p>"There they are!" he exclaimed. "I'll go and let them in myself. It would
  be better to prepare them for your presence. Excuse me."</p>

  <p>His visitor bowed, and resumed his seat.</p>

  <p>"I await the pleasure of the Council," he said with dignity.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chXII"
     id="chXII"></a>XII.&mdash;"A FIGURE FROM A WORLD GONE BY"</h2>

  <p class="first">The Count was left to himself in the bare, untidy-looking
  parlor, and for a minute or two he was content to sit quite still and recover
  himself after the unaccustomed exertion of speech. He needed all his strength
  for what lay before him, but, by degrees, his restlessness grew. He rose from
  his chair and paced up and down in increasing excitement&mdash;his misgivings
  were growing fainter&mdash;he worked himself up into the firm belief that the
  day for which he had waited so long was at hand.</p>

  <p>"They dare not deny me!" he cried, lifting his hands high above his head
  until they almost touched the smoke-begrimed ceiling; "it is my due, my just
  reward!"</p>

  <p>He was so absorbed that he did not hear the noises outside&mdash;the
  shuffling of feet, and, after a while, a brief suppressed tittering. Signor
  Bartlezzi, who had entered the room quietly, had to speak twice before he was
  conscious of his presence.</p>

  <p>"They are in the room behind, Signor Count, and I have informed them of
  your presence," he announced.</p>

  <p>The Count drew himself up, and stopped suddenly short in his restless
  walk.</p>

  <p>"Good!" he exclaimed. "Lead the way! I follow."</p>

  <p>Together they passed into the narrow passage, and the Professor threw open
  the door of another room. The Count entered.</p>

  <p>The Professor had done what he could in the short time at his disposal.
  Pens and ink had been placed upon the deal table, and the chairs had been
  ranged along it instead of around the fire. The tobacco jar and pipes were
  there, however, and some suspicious-looking jugs; and the hasty current of
  fresh air, caused by the withdrawal of a sheet of brown paper from the upper
  window frame, was altogether powerless to cope with the close beer-house
  smell which hung about the place.</p>

  <p>The company consisted of four men. The chair at the head of the table had
  been left vacant for the Professor. On the right sat Andrew Martello, an
  anglicized Italian, and a vendor of ice cream; on the left was Pietro
  Muratti, the proprietor of an itinerant musical instrument. These were the
  only two, besides the Professor, who had any pretense to Italian blood. The
  other two were a French barber and a Jew pawnbroker.</p>

  <p>The light was purposely dim, and the Count's eyes were bad. Besides, his
  long confinement, and the great though suppressed excitement under which he
  was laboring, had to a certain extent confused his judgment. He saw a mean
  room, and four men only, when he had dreamed of a chamber in some great house
  and an important assemblage; but, disappointing though this was, it did not
  seem fatal to his hopes. Let but these four men be faithful to their oaths,
  and he, who had served their cause so well, could demand as a right the boon
  he craved. He strove earnestly to read their faces, but the light was bad and
  his eyes were dim. He must wait. Their voices would show him what manner of
  men they were. After all, why should he doubt for a moment? Men who had
  remained faithful to a dying and deserted cause, must needs be men of
  strength and honorable men. The very fewness of their numbers proved it, else
  why should they too not have fallen away. He would banish all doubt. He would
  speak when his time came with all confidence.</p>

  <p>The Professor introduced him with all solemnity, casting an appealing
  glance at each in turn, as though begging them to accept this matter
  seriously. There was just a slender thread of hope still, and he did not
  intend to abandon it.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he said, "I have the honor to present to you the Count
  Leonardo di Marioni, a martyr, as you all know, to our cause. Count Marioni
  was, only last week, released from an imprisonment which has lasted for
  five-and-twenty years."</p>

  <p>They all looked at him curiously&mdash;a little compassionately, but none
  of them were quite sure how to acknowledge the salutation. The Jew alone
  stood up and made a shuffling little bow; the others remained silent except
  the little French barber, who murmured something about pleasure and
  acquaintance, which the Professor promptly frowned down. The Count, who had
  remained standing, advanced to the bottom of the table, and, laying his
  trembling hands upon it, spoke:</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen and Brothers of the Order of the White Hyacinth," he said
  solemnly, "I am glad to meet you."</p>

  <p>The Frenchman and the Italian Muratti exchanged expressive winks. The
  vendor of ice cream growled across the table for the bird's-eye, and
  commenced leisurely filling his pipe, while the Jew ventured upon a feeble
  "hear, hear."</p>

  <p>"My name is doubtless known to you," the Count continued, "and the story
  of my life, which, I am proud to remember, is closely interwoven with the
  history of your Order. Your faces, alas! are strange to me. My old comrades,
  whom, I had hoped to meet, and whose sympathy I had counted on, are no more.
  I feel somewhat as though I had stepped out of the shadows of a bygone life,
  and everything is a little strange to me. I have grown unaccustomed even to
  speech itself. You must pardon me if I do not make myself understood with
  ease. The past seems very, very far away."</p>

  <p>By this time all the pipes were lit, and the mugs were filled. The smoke
  hung round the little assembly in a faint cloud, and the atmosphere was
  growing dense. The Count looked a little puzzled, but he only hesitated for a
  moment. He remembered that he was in England, and the habits of foreigners
  were not easy to grow accustomed to. It was a small matter, although he
  wished that the odor of the tobacco had not been quite so rank. When he
  resumed speaking, however, it was forgotten in a moment.</p>

  <p>"I must ask you to bear with me in a certain confession which I am about
  to make," he continued. "I am not here to-night to inquire or in any way to
  concern myself in the political prospects of our Order. Alas! that the time
  should come when I should find myself calmly acknowledging that my country's
  sorrows were mine no longer. But, comrades, I must claim from you your
  generous consideration. Five-and-twenty years is a long time. I have lost my
  touch of history. My memory&mdash;I must confess it&mdash;my memory itself is
  weak. I do not doubt that, small though your numbers be, you are nobly
  carrying on the work in which I, too, once bore a part. I do not doubt but
  that you are laboring still in the glorious cause of liberty. But I am with
  you no longer; my work on earth for others, such as it has been, is
  accomplished. I do not come to aid or to join you. Alas! that I should say
  it, I, Leonardo di Marioni, whose life was once so closely bound up with your
  prosperity as the breath of a man is to his body. But it is so. I am stranded
  upon the wreck of my past, and I can only call upon you with a far-distant
  voice for my own salvation."</p>

  <p>There was a distinct air of relief. The vendor of ice cream spat upon the
  floor, and, in response to a frown from the Professor, at once covered it
  with his foot. The Professor drew his hand thoughtfully down his chin. They
  were approaching the <i>crux</i> of the whole matter.</p>

  <p>"We regret it deeply, Count," he said solemnly. "In that case the small
  trifle of money which the London agents of your bank have placed to our
  credit yearly on your behalf for the cause, and which has regularly been used
  for the&mdash;er&mdash;necessary expenses&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Count stretched out his hand.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing," he answered. "Why should you mention it? That and more,
  too, the Order is welcome to. I doubt not that it has been well used."</p>

  <p>"It has!" they cried, with one voice.</p>

  <p>"A drop more beer, and a bottle of bran&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The ice vendor never finished his sentence. A furious kick from the
  Professor, under the table, reminded him that he was on dangerous grounds,
  and he desisted, rubbing his leg and growling.</p>

  <p>The Count scarcely heeded the interruption. His whole form was shaking
  with eagerness; his bony, white hands were outstretched toward his four
  listeners. For five-and-twenty years he had dreamed of this.</p>

  <p>"No, my appearance once more before you, comrades, brothers, has no such
  petty object!" he cried. "I am here to demand my rights as a member of the
  Order of the White Hyacinth. I am here to remind you of our great
  principle&mdash;vengeance upon traitors! I am here to remind you of your
  unchanging oaths, and to claim your fulfillment of them, even as Francesco
  Dellia pleaded, and not in vain, before the council at Rome thirty years ago.
  We are a society of peace, save alone where traitors are concerned. I point
  out to you a traitor, and I cry&mdash;punishment!"</p>

  <p>The Professor knitted his brows, and his hopes suddenly fell. They all
  exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>"Old buffer's dotty," whispered the Jew to his neighbor, tapping his head
  significantly.</p>

  <p>The musical gentleman nodded.</p>

  <p>"Let's hear what it's all about, anyhow," muttered the ice-cream vendor,
  tapping the table.</p>

  <p>There was silence at once. They all turned toward the Count, and
  waited.</p>

  <p>He had not been disappointed in their silence. It seemed to him like the
  prudent reserve of true conspirators. They wished to hear his case, and, as
  yet, he had only reached the preamble. Good! they should hear it.</p>

  <p>"You all know that I was arrested and thrown into prison because I broke
  what they choose to call my parole&mdash;because, after the sentence of
  banishment had been passed upon me, I returned to my native country, and took
  part once more in the counsels of our Order. But you have yet to learn this,
  comrades; you have yet to learn that I was betrayed, foully,
  wilfully&mdash;betrayed into the clutches of the Italian police. Before my
  very eyes papers of our society incriminating me were placed in the hand of
  our enemy, Signor Villesco, by one who had sworn our oaths in the first
  degree and worn our flower. At your hands I call for vengeance upon my
  betrayers&mdash;vengeance upon Adrienne di Cartuccio, calling herself Lady
  St. Maurice, vengeance upon her husband, her family, and all belonging to
  her. It is the first decree of our Order, which all of you have sworn to, and
  I stand within my rights. Answer, comrades of the Order of the White
  Hyacinth! For your sake I have languished five-and-twenty years in a Roman
  prison. With you it rests to sweeten my death. By your oaths, I charge you,
  give me vengeance!"</p>

  <p>His eyes were flashing, and his features, for the first time, were
  convulsed with anxiety. What meant this unsympathetic silence, this lack of
  enthusiasm? He looked from one to another of their stolid, puzzled faces.
  Where were the outstretched hands, the deep solemn oaths, the cry for lots to
  be drawn, which he had confidently expected? Their silence was driving him
  mad. Suddenly the ice-cream vendor spoke.</p>

  <p>"What is it you want, gaffer?" he asked, without removing his pipe from
  his mouth. "Cursed if I can see what you're driving at, or any of us, for
  that matter."</p>

  <p>"What is it I want?" he cried passionately. "The life of my betrayer, or
  such a mark of my vengeance as will make her rue the day she sent one of your
  Order to work out his life, a miserable captive, in a prison cell. Is it not
  clear what I want? Speak, all of you! Do you grudge me this thing? Do you
  hesitate?"</p>

  <p>The vendor of ice cream constituted himself the spokesman of the little
  party. He knocked the dead ashes from his pipe, and leisurely refilled it.
  The little old man at the bottom of the table was shaking with anxiety. The
  thunderbolt quivered in the air.</p>

  <p>"That's all bally rot, you know, guv'nor," he said calmly. "We ain't
  murderers here! This White Hyacinth crew as you're a-talking of must a been a
  blood-thirsty lot o' chaps. We ain't on that track. We meets here just for a
  drop and a smoke, sociable like, with our friend the Professor, and forms a
  sort of a club like among hourselves. You've come to the wrong shop!"</p>

  <p>The man's words, blunt and unfeeling, answered their purpose well. They
  left no possibility of doubt or misunderstanding. The Count, after a moment's
  wild stare around, tottered, and sank into a chair. All that had seemed
  strange to him was suddenly clear. His head fell upon his arms, and he
  crouched there motionless. The hopes of five-and-twenty years were wrecked.
  The spark which had left him alive had died out! The Order of the White
  Hyacinth was no more!</p>

  <p>There was a distinct and terrible pathos in the scene. Even those rough,
  coarse men, casting uneasy glances at that white, bowed head and crouching
  figure at the head of the table, and listening to his low moaning, were
  conscious of a vague pity. They thought of him as of some wandering lunatic
  who had strayed in upon them; and, indeed, none of them, except the
  Professor, doubted but that he was mad.</p>

  <p>He looked up at last, and the ice-cream vendor, who was not a bad sort at
  heart, poured out a mugful of the unwholesome-looking beer, and pushed it
  across the table toward him.</p>

  <p>"Here, guv'nor, drink this," he said gruffly; "it'll do you good. Cheer
  up, old buck! I should. What's done can't be undone, and what's dead can't be
  brought to life again. Make the best of it, I say. You've got some of the
  ready left, I'll go bail, and you ain't too old to get a bit out o' life
  yet&mdash;if yer make haste. And about that blood-thirsty talk of yours,
  about vengeance and such like, you just take my tip and chuck it. We think
  more of life here than they does in furrin parts, and hangin' ain't a
  pleasant death. Take my tip, guv'nor, you chuck it!"</p>

  <p>The Count pushed the mug away, and rose to his feet. He had not heard a
  word. There was a terrible buzzing in his head and ears.</p>

  <p>"I am a foolish old man, I fear," he said unsteadily. "I ought to have
  considered. Five-and-twenty-years! Ah, yes, it is a long time ago. Professor,
  will you send your servant for a carriage? I will go away."</p>

  <p>He stood quite still, talking softly to himself, with the tips of his
  fingers still resting lightly upon the table, and a far-away look in his
  eyes. Signor Bartlezzi himself ran hatless to the nearest cabstand, and in a
  few minutes the rattle of a vehicle was heard outside, and the Professor
  returned breathless. The Count rose at once.</p>

  <p>"I wish you good-night, gentlemen," he said mildly. "You have been very
  patient with me. Five-and-twenty years! It is a long while&mdash;a long
  while! Five-and-twenty years! Good-evening, gentlemen. Professor, I will take
  your arm to the door. My sight is a&mdash;little dim. Thank you. How dark it
  is. The Hotel Continental, if you please. Thank you, Professor."</p>

  <p>And so he went away.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chXIII"
     id="chXIII"></a>XIII.&mdash;BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH</h2>

  <p class="first">For three days Count Leonardo di Marioni abode in his
  sitting-room at the Hotel Continental, living the life of a man in a dream.
  So far as the outside world was concerned, it was a complete case of
  suspended animation. Of all that passed around him he was only dimly
  conscious. The faces of his fellow creatures were strange to him. He had lost
  touch with the world, and the light of his reason was flickering; almost it
  seemed as though it would go out indeed, and leave him groping in the chaos
  of insanity. Mechanically he rose late in the morning, ate what was brought
  to him, or ordered what was suggested. All day long he sat in a sort of
  dreamless apathy, living still the life of the last five-and-twenty years,
  and finding no change, save that the chair in which he sat was softer, and
  the fire over which he stretched his withered palms was a new experience to
  him. There were things even which he missed in the freedom&mdash;if freedom
  it could be called. He missed the warm dancing sunlight which, day by day,
  had filled the shabby sitting-room of his confinement. He missed that patch
  of deep blue sky seen through his high, barred window, and the fragrant
  scents of the outside world which, day by day, had floated through it. He
  missed the kindly greeting of his pitying gaoler, and the simple
  food&mdash;the macaroni, the black coffee, and the fruit&mdash;which had been
  served to him; and above all, there was something else which he missed.</p>

  <p>For through all his apathy he was conscious of a great sickening
  disappointment, something gone out of his life which had helped him, day by
  day, through all that weary imprisonment. Dear to his heart had grown that
  hope of standing one day before the masters of his Order, and claiming, as
  his rightful due, vengeance upon those whose word had sent him into
  captivity. Dear to his memory and treasured among his thoughts had grown that
  hope. In his prison house he had grown narrower; other thoughts and purposes
  had faded away. That one only remained, growing stronger and stronger day by
  day, until it had seized hold of his whole being. He lived only through it
  and with it.</p>

  <p>Given some soul-absorbing purpose, some cherished end, however dimly seen
  through the mists of futurity, and a man may preserve his reason through the
  longest captivity; while, day by day, his narrowing life contracts till all
  conscience, all hope, all sentiment, become the slaves of that one passionate
  desire. Day by day, it looms larger before him; day by day, all doubts
  concerning it grow weaker, and the justice of it becomes clearer and more
  unquestioned. Right and wrong, justice and injustice, according to other
  men's standards, have no power over it in his own thoughts. His moral sense
  slumbers. So deeply has it become grafted into his life, that he no more
  questions its right to exist than he does the presence of the limbs upon his
  body. As surely as the night follows day, so surely does his whole being
  gravitate toward the accomplishment of his desire. It is a part of what is
  left of his life, and if it is smitten, his life is smitten. They are at once
  sympathetic and identical, so closely entwined that to sever them is death to
  both.</p>

  <p>Thus it was with Count Marioni, and thus it was that, day by day, he sat
  in his sitting-room slowly pining to death. Rude feet had trampled upon the
  desire of his life, and the wound was open and bleeding. Only a little while
  longer and he would have turned upon his side with a sigh, and yielded up his
  last breath; and, so far as his numbed faculties could have conceived a
  thought, death would have seemed very pleasant to him. He was dying of
  loneliness, of disappointment and despair.</p>

  <p>The people at the hotel had made several attempts to rouse him, but in
  vain. He answered no questions, and in his quiet way resented intrusion. He
  paid whatever was demanded, and he gave no trouble. The manager, who knew his
  history from a short cutting in a newspaper which had chronicled his arrival
  in London, was at his wits' end to know how to save him. He had once
  endeavored to reason gently with his eccentric visitor, and he had been
  bidden quietly to leave the room. On his endeavoring to make one more appeal,
  the Count had risen quietly and pointed to the door.</p>

  <p>"I wish only to be left in peace," he said, with a touch of dignity in his
  sad, calm manner. "If you cannot do that I will go away to another hotel.
  Choose!"</p>

  <p>The manager had bowed and withdrawn in silence. But he was a kind-hearted
  man, and he was still troubled about the matter. Day by day the Count was
  growing weaker; before long he would doubtless die from sheer distaste of
  living as much as from any actual disease. Something ought to be done toward
  communicating with his friends, if he had any. With a certain amount of
  reluctance, the manager, as a last resource, penned the following
  advertisement and sent it to the principal London papers:</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">"If there are any friends or relatives still alive of
  Count Leonardo di Marioni, who has recently been set free by the Italian
  Government after a long term of imprisonment, they are requested to
  communicate, personally, if possible, with the manager of the Hotel
  Continental, where the Count is now lying dangerously ill."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chXIV"
     id="chXIV"></a>XIV.&mdash;AN EVERLASTING HATE</h2>

  <p class="first">At four o'clock on the afternoon of the following day, an
  open barouche, drawn by a pair of magnificent bay horses, drove up to the
  door of the Hotel Continental. The manager, who was standing at the window of
  his private room, noticed two things&mdash;first, that there was a coronet
  upon the carriage door; and secondly, that the lady who was alighting carried
  in her hand a copy of the <i>Morning Post</i> turned down, as though to mark
  a certain place in it.</p>

  <p>As she crossed the pavement he had a better view of her face, and
  recognized her with a little start of surprise. In a moment he was outside,
  and on the steps to receive her, an attention he very rarely bestowed upon
  his guests.</p>

  <p>The swing doors opened and closed, and the lady, with the paper still in
  her hand, turned to the manager.</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything about this paragraph?" she asked, touching it with
  her delicately-gloved forefinger. "The one, I mean, which concerns the Count
  di Marioni?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, your ladyship," he answered. "I inserted it myself."</p>

  <p>"He is still here, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"He is, your ladyship. I do not know whether you will consider that I
  acted wisely in taking such a step, but I could see no alternative. He
  arrived here alone about a fortnight ago, and at that time there seemed to be
  nothing singular about him excepting his clothing, and a certain nervousness
  which the servants marked in his manner, and which we can scarcely wonder at,
  considering his painful history and recent return to&mdash;er&mdash;civilized
  ways. He left the hotel almost immediately after engaging his room, and was
  away, I believe, for several hours. I chanced to be in the hall on his
  return, and was struck by the change in his appearance. Your ladyship, I
  never saw a man on whose face was written such dumb and helpless agony. He
  went straight to his room, and since then has never left it. He is simply
  pining to death there. He neither eats, nor drinks, nor speaks. He sits
  there, with his eyes fixed upon the fire, like a man waiting for his end. I
  ventured to visit him one morning, but my attempts at remonstrance were cut
  short at once in a most dignified fashion. I feel that it would be heartless
  to ask him to leave the hotel; but, at the same time, if he remains, and
  continues in the same way, he will certainly either die or go mad very
  shortly. What he wants is the personal care of friends, and very kind
  treatment; and as I could think of no other way of communication with them, I
  decided to advertise his presence here. I trust that your ladyship does not
  think my interference officious?"</p>

  <p>He bowed his head, and turned away out of respect for the tears which he
  could see in her eyes, and which she made scarcely an effort to conceal.</p>

  <p>"No; you did quite right," she said after a moment's pause. "I was waiting
  for my husband outside the club, and quite by chance I took up the
  <i>Post</i> and saw your paragraph. I drove here at once. Will you show me to
  the Count's rooms, if you please?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, your ladyship. Will you come this way?"</p>

  <p>She followed him up the fine marble staircase and down the first-floor
  corridor. At the extreme end he paused outside a door.</p>

  <p>"It is of no use knocking," he said; "he never answers. If I can be of any
  further service, your ladyship will perhaps be so good as to ring the
  bell."</p>

  <p>He opened the door for her, and closed it quietly as she entered. Then he
  retreated along the corridor, and returned to his room, wondering not a
  little at the visitor whom his advertisement had brought.</p>

  <p>The great room in which the Count Marioni was sitting was almost in
  darkness, for the afternoon was dull and foggy, and the curtains were
  partially closed. There was no lamp lit, and the only light came from the
  brightly-burning fire near which the Count was sitting in an armchair
  ludicrously too large for his frail body. The flames fell upon his white,
  worn face, with its deep branding lines, and gleamed in his great sad eyes,
  so bright and dry that they seemed like mirrors for the firelight. His hair
  and short unkempt beard were as white as snow, matching even the unnatural
  pallor of his skin, and his black frock coat was buttoned across a chest
  which would have been narrow for a consumptive boy. He did, indeed, look on
  the threshold of death.</p>

  <p>He had not turned his head at the opening or closing of the door, but
  presently another sound broke the silence. It was a woman's sob, and as he
  slowly turned his head, a tall, graceful figure moved forward out of the
  shadows, and he heard his name softly murmured.</p>

  <p>"Leonardo!"</p>

  <p>His hand went up to his forehead. Was it a dream; or was he indeed back
  once more in the days of his youth, back among the pine woods which topped
  his castle, walking side by side with her whose presence seemed to make the
  long summer days one sweet dream of delight? The familiar odor of violets and
  wild hyacinths seemed to fill the room. The fog-bound city, with its
  ceaseless roar, existed for him no longer. The sun of his own dear country
  warmed his heart, and the sea wind blew in his eager face. And she was
  there&mdash;his queen&mdash;the great desire of his weary life. All his
  pulses leaped with the joy of her presence. Five-and-twenty years of lonely
  misery were blotted out. Ah! memory is a wonderful magician!</p>

  <p>"Leonardo! Will you not speak to me?"</p>

  <p>Again that voice! Where was he now? Face to face with her on the sands at
  Palermo, deceived, betrayed, given over to the enemies of his country, and by
  her&mdash;the woman for whom his passionate love had been his sole crime.
  Listen! The air is full of that cry of threatened vengeance. Hark how the
  echoes ring back from the cliffs. "By the sun, and the sky, and the sea, and
  the earth, I swear that, as they continue unchanged and unchanging, so shall
  my hate for you remain!" Darkness&mdash;a prison cell. Year by year, year by
  year, darkness, solitude, misery! See the blade hair turn gray, the strength
  of manhood wasting away, the eye growing dim, the body weak. Year by year,
  year by year, it goes on. What was that scratched upon the whitewashed walls?
  What was the cry which rang back from the towering cliff! "Hate unchanging
  and unchanged!" The same&mdash;ever the same.</p>

  <p>"Leonardo, have you no word for me?"</p>

  <p>He rose slowly from his chair, and fixed his eyes upon her.</p>

  <p>Before their fire she shrank back, appalled. Was it a storm about to burst
  upon her? No! The words were slow and few.</p>

  <p>"You have dared to come&mdash;here; dared to come and look upon your
  handiwork! Away! Out of my sight! You have seen me. Go!"</p>

  <p>Tears blinded her eyes. The sight of him was horrible to her. She forgot,
  in her great pity, that justice had been upon her side. She sank upon her
  knees before him on the velvet pile carpet.</p>

  <p>"Leonardo, for the love of God, forgive me!" she sobbed. "Oh! it is
  painful to see you thus, and to know the burden of hate which you carry in
  your heart. Forgive me! Forgive us both!"</p>

  <p>He stooped down until his ghastly face nearly touched hers.</p>

  <p>"Curse you!" he muttered hoarsely. "You dare to look at me, and ask for
  forgiveness. Never! never! Every morning and night I curse you. I curse you
  when my mother taught me to pray. I live for nothing else. If I had the
  strength I would strangle you where you stand. Hell's curses and mine ring in
  your ears and sit in your heart day by day and night by night! Away with you!
  Away, away!"</p>

  <p>She was a brave woman, but she fled from the room like a hunted animal,
  and passed out of the hotel with never a look to the right or to the
  left.</p>

  <p>The manager came out to speak to her, but he stood still, aghast, and let
  her go without uttering a word or offering to assist her. As long as he lived
  he remembered the look on the Countess of St. Maurice's face as she came down
  those stairs, clutching hold of the banisters, and, with hasty trembling
  steps, left the hotel. He was a great reader of fiction, and he had heard of
  Irish banshees and Brahmin ghosts; but never a living story-teller had
  painted such a face as he looked upon at that moment.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chXV"
     id="chXV"></a>XV.&mdash;THE COUNT'S SECOND VISITOR</h2>

  <p class="first">Two days more passed without any change in the Count's
  conduct or health, save that his brow was a little darker, and he was heard
  occasionally muttering to himself.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the third, a four-wheeled cab deposited at the door of
  the hotel a young lady, who demanded somewhat haughtily to see the manager.
  She was shown into the waiting-room, and in a few minutes he appeared.</p>

  <p>He had been expecting a visit from an applicant for the post of assistant
  bookkeeper, and he entered the room with a little less than his usual
  ceremony, under the impression that this was she. He found himself confronted
  with a tall, slim girl, elegantly but simply dressed in plain black clothes.
  She carried herself with the dignity of a queen, and before the quick glance
  of her flashing black eyes he felt himself abashed into making a low bow.
  There was something foreign in her appearance, but something eminently
  aristocratic.</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, madam."</p>

  <p>She disdained to notice the salutation, and, holding out a paper toward
  him, pointed with her long slim finger to the advertisement column.</p>

  <p>"I have come about this paragraph. Take me to him!"</p>

  <p>"With the greatest pleasure, madam," he answered, bowing. "May I be
  permitted to ask, are you a relation of the Count's?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, I am his niece," she answered, frowning. "Take me to him at
  once. I don't choose to be kept waiting," she added impetuously.</p>

  <p>The manager bit his lip, and bowed again to hide a smile. It seemed to him
  that if this young lady failed to rouse his eccentric visitor the task was
  hopeless indeed.</p>

  <p>"Will you pardon me, madam, if I detain you one moment," he said
  deferentially. "I should like, before you see the Count, to explain to you
  the reasons which induced me to insert that notice in the <i>Times</i>."</p>

  <p>She tapped the floor impatiently with her foot.</p>

  <p>"Be quick, then!"</p>

  <p>"The Count arrived here on the first of the month, almost a fortnight ago.
  Immediately on his arrival he went out in a cab, and returned somewhat late
  at night, looking dazed and ill. From that moment he has not left his room,
  and we fear, madam, to be candid, that he is losing his reason. He declines
  to go out to see a physician; to write to his friends. It is pitiable to see
  him, especially when one considers his long and painful imprisonment, from
  which he has only just been released. He would not listen to any suggestions
  or advice from us, so it occurred to me to put that advertisement in the
  paper unknown to him. May I be pardoned if I beg of you not to mention the
  means by which you became aware of his presence here, or to simply state that
  you saw his arrival chronicled in the paper? He may regard our interference
  in the light of a liberty, although it was solely for his good."</p>

  <p>"It was a liberty to take!" she answered coldly. "I will not promise
  anything. I dare say I shall not mention it."</p>

  <p>"There is one thing more which I should tell you, madam," he continued.
  "Two days ago a visitor came to see him, having noticed in the paper, as you
  have done, the paragraph I inserted. I will not tell you her name, but she
  was one of the most beautiful and distinguished Englishwomen of our
  aristocracy, and from the manner of her departure, I could not help coming to
  the conclusion that the Count, by some means or other, had frightened her to
  death. She was nearly fainting as she came downstairs, and she has not been
  here since. I have no reason, beyond what I have told you, to doubt the
  Count's sanity, but I think that it is right for you to know this."</p>

  <p>"Very well. I am not afraid. Kindly take me to him at once, now!" she
  directed.</p>

  <p>He led her out of the apartment, and up the broad staircase. Outside the
  door of the Count's sitting-room he paused.</p>

  <p>"Shall I announce you, madam?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No! Go away!" she answered shortly. "I wish to enter alone."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chXVI"
     id="chXVI"></a>XVI.&mdash;A NEW MEMBER FOR THE ORDER</h2>

  <p class="first">Count Marioni sat in his old attitude, brooding over the
  fire from the depths of his armchair, with a sad, vacant look in his dull
  eyes. At first he took no notice of the opening of the door, but as the
  light, smooth footsteps crossed the floor toward him and hesitated at his
  side, he glanced wearily up. In a moment his whole expression was changed. He
  was like a numbed and torpid figure suddenly galvanized into acute life.</p>

  <p>He passed his hand swiftly across his eyes, and his thin fingers grasped
  the sides of his chair with nervous force. Ah! he must be dreaming again! It
  was one of the faces of the past, tempting and mocking him! Yet, no! she
  stood there; surely she stood there. Mother of God! Was this madness come at
  last?</p>

  <p>"Margharita!" he cried, stretching out his hands toward her.
  "Margharita!"</p>

  <p>It was no dream, then, nor was it madness. It was truth. There were
  loving, clinging arms around his neck, a passionate, weeping face pressed
  close against his. Hot tears, her tears, were tricking down his hollow
  cheeks, kindling his stagnant blood by their warmth, and thawing the
  apathetic chill whose icy hand had lain so heavy upon him. A sob escaped him.
  His eager, trembling fingers pushed back the clustering hair from her
  temples. He peered wonderingly into her face. It must be a vision; it would
  surely fade away, and leave him once more in the outer darkness.
  Five-and-twenty years had passed! She had been like this then! A sense of
  bewilderment crept in upon him.</p>

  <p>"Margharita!" he exclaimed feebly. "I do not understand! You are
  Margharita; you have her hair, her eyes, her mouth! And yet, of course, it
  cannot be. Ah, no! it cannot be!"</p>

  <p>"You are thinking of my mother," she cried softly. "She loved you so much.
  I am like her, am I not?"</p>

  <p>"Married! Margharita married! Ah, of course! I had forgotten. And you are
  her child. My sister's child. Ah, five-and-twenty years is a long time."</p>

  <p>"It is a shameful, cruel time," she cried passionately. "My mother used to
  tell me of it, when I was a little girl, and her voice would shake with anger
  and pity. Francesca, too, would talk to me about you. I prayed for you every
  evening when I was little, that they might soon set you free again. Oh, it
  was cruel!"</p>

  <p>She threw her arms around his neck, and he rested his head upon her
  shoulder. It was like an elixir of life for him.</p>

  <p>"And your mother, Margharita?" he asked fearfully.</p>

  <p>"She is dead," was the low reply.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Margharita dead! She was so like you, child. Dead! Five-and-twenty
  years is a weary while. Dead!"</p>

  <p>He sighed, and his tearless eyes looked thoughtfully into the fire.
  Memories of other days were rising up and passing before him in swift
  procession. He saw himself and her, orphan brother and sister, wandering hand
  in hand over their beautiful island home, with the sea wind blowing in their
  faces, and the spirit of the mountains which towered around them entering
  into their hearts. Dear to them had been that home, dear that close and
  precious companionship. They had talked of the life which lay before
  them&mdash;rose-colored and joyous, pregnant with glorious opportunities and
  possibilities. For their island and the larger continent close at hand were
  convulsed at that time in certain patriotic efforts, the history of which has
  been written into the history of Europe, and no one desired more ardently to
  bear a hand in the struggle than young Leonardo di Marioni. Large hearted,
  romantic, and with an imagination easily fired, he was from the first a
  dreamer, and Margharita had ever been ready to share his dreams. The blood of
  kings was in their veins, to lead him on to great things; and she,
  Margharita, his sister, his beloved sister, should be the mistress of his
  destinies. Thus they had talked, thus they had dreamed, and now from the
  other side of the gulf he looked backward, and saw in his own life, in the
  place of those great deeds which he had hoped to accomplish, one black
  miserable chasm, and in hers, forgetfulness of her high descent&mdash;for she
  had married this English merchant's son&mdash;and the grave. Ah! it was sad,
  very sad!</p>

  <p>Her soft breath upon his cheek brought him back to the present. He looked
  down into her face with such a wistful fondness that it brought the tears
  again into her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Your mother, then, married Martin Briscoe?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My father, too, is dead," she answered sadly. "I am an orphan."</p>

  <p>"Ah! And now you live&mdash;with whom do you live, child?" he asked, with
  sudden eagerness. "Tell me, are you happy?"</p>

  <p>"I am miserable," she cried passionately.</p>

  <p>A quiet smile flitted across his face. There was hope. It was well.</p>

  <p>"I am miserable. Often I wish that I were dead."</p>

  <p>"Tell me all about it, child," he whispered. "I have a right to know."</p>

  <p>She sank down upon the floor, and rested her head upon the side of the
  chair. In a moment she began.</p>

  <p>"I think that I was quite happy when I was a little girl. I do not
  remember very much about that time, or about my mother, for she died when I
  was six years old. Papa was very good to me, but he was stern and cold
  always. I do not think that he ever smiled after mamma died, and he had money
  troubles, too. A bank failed, and he lost a great deal; and then he had a
  great many shares in a company which failed. I don't understand much about
  it, but when he died three years ago nearly everything he had went to pay
  people. I had to go and live with my father's brother, and I hate it. I hate
  them all&mdash;my uncle, my aunt, and my cousins. They are vulgar, common
  people. They are in business, and they are fearfully rich, but their manners
  are dreadful, and they are always talking of their money. They have no taste,
  no art, no refinement. I was going to leave them, when I heard that you were
  here. I was going to be a governess&mdash;yes, even earn my own
  bread&mdash;rather than stay with them any longer. I hated them so, and their
  life, and everything to do with them. Oh, uncle, uncle, let me live with you.
  Let us go away from this wretched England. Let us go to some southern country
  where the sun is warm, and the people do not talk of their money, and there
  are beautiful things to see and admire. It is ugly and cold here, and I am
  weary of it."</p>

  <p>She broke off in a sudden fit of sobbing. He took her face gently in his
  hands, and held it up to him. It was he, now, who was to play the part of
  consoler.</p>

  <p>"Margharita, I am a lonely old man whose life is well nigh spent. Yet, if
  you will come to me, if you will really live with me, then you will make my
  last days happy. When I die all that I have will be yours. It is settled, is
  it not?"</p>

  <p>Like summer lightning the tempest of her grief died away, and her face was
  brilliant with smiles.</p>

  <p>"I will never, never leave you, uncle," she cried joyously. "We will live
  together always. Oh, how happy we shall be!"</p>

  <p>Then she looked at him&mdash;looked at his shrunken limbs and worn,
  pinched face, and a sudden darkening fire kindled in her face. She stamped
  her foot, and her eyes flashed angrily. The sight of him reminded her that,
  so far as he was concerned at least, their happiness could not be of very
  long duration. The finger of death had laid its mark upon that ashen gray
  face. It was written there.</p>

  <p>"How I hate them!" she cried. "Those cruel, wicked people, who kept you in
  prison all these years. I should like to kill them all&mdash;to see them die
  here before us. I would not spare one&mdash;not one!"</p>

  <p>He thrust her away, and started to his feet a changed man. The old fires
  had leaped up anew; the old hate, the old desire, was as strong as ever
  within him. She looked at him, startled and wondering. His very form seemed
  dilated with passion.</p>

  <p>"Child!" he cried, "have you ever heard the story of my seizure and
  imprisonment? No, you have not. You shall hear it. You shall judge between me
  and them. Listen! When I was a young man, Italy seemed trembling on the verge
  of a revolution. The history of it all you know. You know that the country
  was honeycombed with secret societies, more or less dangerous. To one of
  these I belonged. We called our Order the 'Order of the White Hyacinth.' We
  were all young, ardent and impetuous, and we imagined ourselves the apostles
  of the coming liberation. Yet we never advocated bloodshed; we never really
  transgressed the law. We gave lectures, we published pamphlets. We were a set
  of boy dreamers with wild theories&mdash;communists, most of us. But there
  was not one who would not have died to save our country the misery of civil
  war&mdash;not one, not one! Even women wore our flower, and were admitted
  associates of our Order. We pledged ourselves that our aims were bloodless.
  No society that ever existed was more harmless than ours. I say it! I swear
  it! Bear me witness, oh, my God, if what I say be not true!"</p>

  <p>He was a strong man again. The apathy was gone; his reason was saved. He
  stood before this dark, tall girl, who, with clasped hands, was drinking in
  every word, and he spoke with all the swelling dignity of one who has
  suffered unjustly.</p>

  <p>"By some means or other our society fell under the suspicion of the
  government. The edict went forth that we should be broken up. We heard the
  mandate with indignation. We were young and hot-blooded, and we were
  conscious that we had done no harm&mdash;that we were innocent of the things
  ascribed to us. We swore that we would carry on our society, but in secret.
  Before then, everything had been open; we had had a recognized meeting place,
  the public had attended our lectures, ladies had worn the white hyacinth
  openly at receptions and balls. Now, all was changed. We met in secret and
  under a ban. Still our aim was harmless. One clause alone was added to our
  rules of a different character, and we all subscribed to&mdash;'Vengeance
  upon traitors!' We swore it solemnly one to the other&mdash;'Vengeance upon
  traitors!"</p>

  <p>"Ah! if I had lived in those days I would have worn your flower at the
  court of the king," she cried, with glowing cheeks.</p>

  <p>He pressed her hand in silence, and continued.</p>

  <p>"As time went on, and things grew still more unsettled in the country, a
  species of inquisition was established. The eyes of the law were everywhere.
  They fell upon us. One night ten of us were arrested as we left our meeting
  place. We were all noble, and the families of my companions were powerful. I
  was looked upon as the ringleader; and upon me fell the most severe sentence.
  I was banished from Italian soil for ten years, with the solemn warning that
  death would be my lot if I ventured to return."</p>

  <p>"It was atrocious!"</p>

  <p>He held up his hand.</p>

  <p>"Margharita, in those days I loved. Her name was Adrienne. She, too, was
  an orphan, and although she was of noble birth, she was poor, as we Marionis
  were poor also. She had a great gift; she was a singer; and, sooner than be
  dependent upon her relatives, she had sung at concerts and operas, until all
  Europe knew of her fame. When I was exiled I was given seven days in which to
  make my adieux. I went to her, and declared my love. She did not absolutely
  reject me, nor did she accept me. She asked for time for consideration. I
  could give her none! I begged her to leave the country with me. Alas! she
  would not! Perhaps I was too passionate, too precipitate! It may have been
  so; I cannot say. I went away alone and left her. I plunged into gay life at
  Paris; I dwelt among the loneliest mountains of Switzerland; I endured the
  dullness of this cold gray London, and the dissipation of Vienna. It was all
  in vain! One by one they palled upon me. No manner of life, no change of
  scene, could cure me of my love. I fell ill, and I knew that my heart was
  breaking. You and I, Margharita, come of a race whose love and hatred are
  eternal!"</p>

  <p>She crept into his arms; and he went on, holding her there.</p>

  <p>"Back I came at the peril of my life; content to die, if it were only at
  her feet. I found her cold and changed; blaming me even for my rashness,
  desiring even my absence. Not a word of pity to sweeten those weary days of
  exile; not a word of hope to repay me for all that I had risked to see her
  again. Soon I knew the reason&mdash;another love had stolen away her heart.
  There was an Englishman&mdash;one of those cursed Englishmen&mdash;visiting
  her daily at Palermo; and she told me calmly one day that she loved him, and
  intended to become his wife. She forgot my long years of devoted service; she
  forgot her own unspoken, yet understood, promise; she forgot all that I had
  suffered for her; she forgot that her words must sound to me as the death
  warrant of all joy and happiness in this world. And she forgot, too, that I
  was a Marioni! Was I wrong, I wonder, Margharita, that I quarreled with him!
  You are a child, and yet my instinct tells me that you have a woman's
  judgment! Tell me, should I have stepped aside, and let him win her, without
  a blow?"</p>

  <p>"You would have been a coward if you had!" she cried. "You fought him!
  Tell me that you fought him?"</p>

  <p>"Margharita, you are a true daughter of your country!" the old man cried.
  "You are a Marioni! Listen! I insulted him! He declined to fight! I struck
  him across the face in a public restaurant, and forced him to accept my
  challenge. The thing was arranged. We stood face to face on the sand, sword
  in hand. The word had been given! His life was at my mercy; but mind,
  Margharita, I had no thought of taking it without giving him a fair chance. I
  intended to wait until my sword was at his throat and then I would have said
  to him, 'Give up the woman whom I have loved all my life, and go unhurt!' He
  himself should have chosen. Was not that fair?"</p>

  <p>"Fair! It was generous! Go on! Go on!"</p>

  <p>"The word had been given; our swords were crossed. And at that moment,
  she, Adrienne, the woman whom I loved, stood before us. With her were Italian
  police come to arrest me! There was one letter alone of mine, written in a
  hasty moment, which could have been used in evidence against me at my former
  trial, and which would have secured for me a harsher sentence. That letter
  had fallen into her hands; and she had given it over to my bitter enemy, the
  chief of the Italian police. I was betrayed, betrayed by the woman whom I had
  braved all dangers to see! It was she who had brought them; she
  who&mdash;without remorse or hesitation&mdash;calmly handed me over to
  twenty-five years' captivity in a prison cell!"</p>

  <p>Margharita freed herself from his arms. She was very pale, and her limbs
  were shaking. But what a fire in those dark, cruel eyes.</p>

  <p>"Go on! Go on!" she cried. "Let me hear the rest."</p>

  <p>"Then, as I stood there, Margharita, love shriveled up, and hate reigned
  in its place. The memory of the oath of our Order flashed into my mind. A
  curtain seemed raised before my eyes. I saw the long narrow room of our
  meeting place. I saw the dark, faithful faces of my comrades. I heard their
  firm voices&mdash;'Vengeance upon traitors, vengeance upon traitors!' She,
  too, this woman who had betrayed me, had worn our flower upon her bosom and
  in her hair! She had come under the ban of that oath. Margharita, I threw my
  sword into the sea, and I raised my clasped hands to the sky, and I swore
  that, were it the last day of my life, the day of my release should see me
  avenged. Let them hide in the uttermost corners of the earth, I cried, that
  false woman and her English lover, still I would find them out, and they
  should taste of my vengeance! To my trial I went, with that oath written in
  my heart. I carried it with me into my prison cell, and day by day and year
  by year I repeated it to myself. It kept me alive; the desire of it grew into
  my being. Even now it burns in my heart!</p>

  <p>"During my captivity I was allowed to see my lawyer, and I made over by
  deed so much, to be paid every year to the funds of our Order at the London
  Branch, for our headquarters had been moved there after my first arrest. Day
  by day I dreamed of the time when I should stand, a martyr in their cause,
  before my old comrades, and demand of them the vengeance which was my due. I
  imagined them, one by one, grasping my hand, full of deep, silent sympathy
  with my long sufferings. I heard again the oath which we had
  sworn&mdash;'Vengeance upon traitors, vengeance upon traitors!' It was the
  music which kept me alive, the hope which nourished my life!"</p>

  <p>The dark eyes glowed upon him like stars, and her voice trembled with
  eagerness.</p>

  <p>"You have been to them? You will be avenged! Tell me that it is so?"</p>

  <p>A little choking sob escaped from him. The numbness was passing away from
  his heart and senses. His sorrows were becoming human, and demanding human
  expression.</p>

  <p>"Alas, Margharita, alas!" he cried, with drooping head, "the bitterest
  disappointment of my life came upon me all unawares. While I have lain
  rotting in prison history has turned over many pages. The age for secret
  societies has gone by. The 'Order of the White Hyacinth' is no
  more&mdash;worse than that, its very name has been dragged through the dust.
  One by one the old members fell away; its sacred aims were forgotten. The
  story of its downward path will never be written. A few coarse, ignorant men
  meet in a pothouse, night by night, to spend the money I sent in beer and
  foul tobacco. That is the end of the 'Order of the White Hyacinth!'"</p>

  <p>Margharita looked like a beautiful wild animal in her passion. Her hair
  had fallen all over her face, and was streaming down her back. Her small
  white hand was clenched and upraised, and her straight, supple figure,
  panther-like in its grace, was distended until she towered over the little
  shrunken form before her. Terrible was the gleam in her eyes, and terrible
  the fixed rigidity of her features. Yet she was as beautiful as a young
  goddess in her wrath.</p>

  <p>"No!" she cried fiercely, "the Order shall not die! You belong to it
  still; and I&mdash;I, too, swear the oath of vengeance! Together we will hunt
  her down&mdash;this woman! She shall suffer!"</p>

  <p>"She shall die!" he cried.</p>

  <p>A slight shudder passed across the girl's face, but she repeated his
  words.</p>

  <p>"She shall die! But, uncle, you are ill. What is it?"</p>

  <p>She chafed his hands and held him up. He had fainted.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chXVII"
     id="chXVII"></a>XVII.&mdash;THE RETURN TO REASON</h2>

  <p class="first">"Where am I, Margharita?"</p>

  <p>She leaned over him, and drew a long deep breath of relief. It was the
  reward of many weary days and nights of constant watching and careful
  nursing. His reason was saved.</p>

  <p>"In your own room at the hotel," she whispered. "Don't you remember? You
  were taken ill."</p>

  <p>He looked at her, helpless and puzzled. Slowly the mists began to roll
  away.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you were with me," he murmured softly. "I remember now. I was
  telling you the story of the past&mdash;my past. You are Margharita's child.
  Yes, I remember. Was it this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>She kissed his forehead, and then drew back suddenly, lest the warm tear
  which was quivering on her eyelid should fall back upon his face.</p>

  <p>"It was three weeks ago!"</p>

  <p>"Three weeks ago!" He looked wonderingly around&mdash;at the little table
  at his side, where a huge bowl of sweet-scented roses was surrounded by a
  little army of empty medicine bottles, at Margharita's pale, wan face, and at
  a couch drawn up to the bedside. "And you have been nursing me all the time?"
  he whispered.</p>

  <p>She smiled brightly through the tears which she could not hide.</p>

  <p>"Of course I have. Who has a better right, I should like to know?"</p>

  <p>He sighed and closed his eyes. In a few minutes he was asleep.</p>

  <p>For a fortnight his life had hung upon a thread, and even when the doctor
  had declared him out of danger, the question of his sanity or insanity
  quivered upon the balance for another week. He would either awake perfectly
  reasonable, in all respects his old self, or he would open his eyes upon a
  world, the keynote to which he had lost forever. In other words he would
  either awake a perfectly sane man, or hopelessly and incurably insane. There
  would be no middle course. That was the doctor's verdict.</p>

  <p>And through all those long days and nights Margharita had watched over him
  as though he had been her own father. All the passionate sympathy of her warm
  southern nature had been kindled by the story of his wrongs. Day by day the
  sight of his helpless suffering had increased her indignation toward those
  whom she really believed to have bitterly wronged him. Through those long
  quiet days and silent nights, she had brooded upon them. She never for one
  moment repented of having allied herself to that wild oath of vengeance,
  whose echoes often at dead of night seemed still to ring in her ears. Her
  only fear was that he would emerge from the fierce illness under which he was
  laboring, so weakened and shaken, that the desire of his life should have
  passed from him. She had grown to love this shrunken old man. In her girlhood
  she had heard stories of him from her nurse, and many times the hot tears had
  stood in her eyes as she conjured up to herself that pathetic figure, waiting
  and waiting, year by year, for that liberty which was to come only with old
  age. She had thought of him, sad-eyed and weary, pacing his lonely prison
  cell, and ever watching through his barred window the little segment of blue
  sky and sunlight which penetrated into the high-walled court. How he must
  long for the scent of flowers, the fresh open air, the rustle of leaves, and
  the hum of moving insects. How his heart must ache for the sound of men's
  voices, the touch of their hands, some sense of loving or friendly
  companionship to break the icy monotony of his weary, stagnant existence. Her
  imagination had been touched, and she had been all ready to welcome and to
  love him as a hero and a martyr, even if he had appealed to her in no other
  way. But when she had seen him stricken down and helpless, with that look of
  ineffable sadness in his soft dark eyes, it was more than her sympathy which
  was aroused, more than her imagination which was stirred. Her large pitying
  heart became his absolutely. She was alone in the world, and she must needs
  love some one. For good or for evil, fate had brought this strange old man to
  her, and woven this tie between them.</p>

  <p>That night she scarcely slept at all, and before daybreak she stole softly
  over to the window and looked out. The roar of the great city was hushed and
  silent. Below, the streets and squares were white and empty in the gray light
  of the approaching dawn. The mists were rising from the river, and the yellow
  light was dying out of the room. Away eastward, there was a break in the sky,
  a long thin line of amber light which widened even while she watched it.
  Below, the sky was red, a dull brick red, as though the yellow fog had
  mingled with the fainter and rosier coloring. Gradually the two came nearer
  together. In the distance a cock crew, and a cab drove across the empty
  square at the end of the street. A lamplighter came round the corner,
  whistling, and, one by one, the row of gaslights beneath were extinguished.
  Even in that moment or two a brighter shade had stolen into the eastern sky.
  That bank of dull purple clouds was breaking away, and a few brilliant specks
  of cloudlets were shot up toward St. Paul's. Then the sun showed a rim, and
  almost its first pale beam quivered upon the great church dome, traveled
  across a thousand slate roofs, and fell upon the girl's white, upturned face,
  and across the white coverlet.</p>

  <p>"Margharita!"</p>

  <p>She turned round quickly. He was sitting up in bed, and the sunbeam was
  traveling up toward him.</p>

  <p>"Are you awake? Did I disturb you?" she asked tenderly.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I have been awake, thinking. I remember being taken ill. I remember
  everything. Tell me. I must know. Did you&mdash;did you mean&mdash;everything
  you said? You pitied me, and my story made you sad. I would not hold you to
  your word."</p>

  <p>She drew herself up; she was pale no longer; the color burned in her
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I am a Marioni!" she answered proudly. "Every word I said seems to me now
  too weak. That is the only change."</p>

  <p>He held out his hands; she grasped them fondly.</p>

  <p>"Margharita, she came here!" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"What, here? Here in this room?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"It was two days before you came. I was sitting alone in the twilight. The
  door opened. I thought I was dreaming. It was she, as beautiful as ever,
  richly dressed, happy, comely. She came to pity, to sue for pardon. I let her
  talk, and then, when I had gathered strength, I stood up and cursed her. I
  thrust her away; I cursed her with the fiercest and crudest words which my
  lips could utter. It drove the warm color from her cheeks, and the light from
  her eyes. I cursed her till her heart shook with fear. She staggered out of
  the room a stricken woman. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tell me her name."</p>

  <p>"It was Adrienne Cartuccio. It is now Lady Maurice."</p>

  <p>"The Lady St. Maurice! She was my mother's friend then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Margharita's eyes were bright, and her voice trembled.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" she cried. "When my mother was dying she gave me a letter. If
  ever you need a friend or help," she whispered, "go to Lady St. Maurice. This
  letter is to her. She will help you for my sake. Uncle, fate is on our side.
  Just before I came to you I wrote to Lady St. Maurice. I told her that I was
  unhappy in my life, and I wished for a situation as a governess. I sent her
  my mother's letter."</p>

  <p>"And she replied?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. She offered me a home. If I wished I could teach her little
  girl."</p>

  <p>Her voice was trembling, and her eyes, dry and brilliant, were fixed upon
  his. He was sitting upright in bed, leaning a little forward toward her, and
  the sunbeam which had stolen in through the parted curtains fell upon his
  white corpse-like face. A strange look was in his eyes; his fingers clutched
  the bedclothes nervously.</p>

  <p>"You will&mdash;go?" he asked hoarsely. "You will go to Lady St.
  Maurice?"</p>

  <p>An answering light shot back from her eyes. She was suddenly pale to the
  lips. Her voice was hushed as though in fear, but it was firm.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I shall go. To-night I shall accept her offer."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chXVIII"
     id="chXVIII"></a>XVIII.&mdash;"I HAVE A FEAR&mdash;A FOOLISH FEAR"</h2>

  <p class="first">"Geoff, it's the most extraordinary thing in the world."</p>

  <p>"What is it, dear?" he asked, throwing down his newspaper on the breakfast
  table, and lighting a cigarette. "Tell me about it."</p>

  <p>"Listen."</p>

  <p>She read the letter, which was open in her hands, and he listened
  thoughtfully, leaning back in the high-backed oak chair, and watching the
  blue smoke from his cigarette curl upward to the ceiling.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"London, Thursday.</p>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Dear Lady St. Maurice</span>:<br>
  I have delayed answering your letter for some time, longer than may seem
  courteous to you, owing to the illness of a member of the family with whom I
  have been living. I trust, however, that you will not consider it too late
  for me to thank you heartily for your generous offer to me, which, if we can
  agree upon one point, I shall be most happy and grateful to accept. You have
  a little girl, you tell me, and no governess. If you will allow me to fill
  the latter position, which I believe that I am quite capable of doing, I
  shall be glad to come. I could not feel myself at ease in becoming one of
  your household on any other footing. Hoping to hear from you soon, I am,
  yours sincerely,</p>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Margharita Briscoe.</span>"</p><br>

  <p>"Did you ever hear of such a thing?" Lady St. Maurice exclaimed.
  "Margharita's child, my governess. I call it very stupid pride."</p>

  <p>Lord St. Maurice shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I think you are wrong, dear. After all, you must remember that you are a
  complete stranger to her."</p>

  <p>"That has been her mother's fault. Margharita never exactly blamed me for
  what I did at Palermo, but she always felt bitterly for her brother, and she
  could not forget that it was my hand which had sent him to prison. It was
  very unreasonable of her, but, after all, one can understand her feeling.
  Still, this girl of hers can have no such feeling toward me."</p>

  <p>"Of course not; but, none the less, as I said before, you are a complete
  stranger to her," Lord St. Maurice answered. "Her parentage is just the sort
  to have given her those independent ideas, and I'm inclined to think that she
  is quite right."</p>

  <p>Lady St. Maurice sighed.</p>

  <p>"I would have been only too happy to have welcomed her as a daughter," she
  said. "I dare say you are right, Geoff. I shall write and tell her to
  come."</p>

  <p>She walked away to the window, looking across the pine-bound cliffs to the
  sea. Time had dealt with her very leniently, as indeed he needs must with
  those whose life is like one long summer's day. Her brow was still smooth,
  and her hair, rich and soft as ever, had not a single tinge of gray. Her
  figure, too, was perfect; the lithe gracefulness of youth had only ripened
  into the majesty of dignified womanhood. There was not a society paper which
  did not sometimes allude to her as "the beautiful Lady St. Maurice."</p>

  <p>But just at that moment her eyes were sad, and her face was troubled. Her
  husband, looking up suddenly, saw it, and throwing down his paper, walked
  across the room to her side.</p>

  <p>"Adrienne, what is it, little woman?" he asked fondly.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of poor Leonardo," she answered. "Geoffrey, it is very
  foolish to let it trouble me, is it not?"</p>

  <p>"Very, darling. Why should it?"</p>

  <p>"Do you remember how terrible he looked when they arrested him on the
  sands, and those fierce threatening words of his? Even now I can hear them
  sometimes in my ears."</p>

  <p>"Foolish little woman."</p>

  <p>"I cannot help it. This girl's letter, with its note of proud
  independence, brings it all back to me. Geoffrey, Leonardo di Marioni comes
  of a race who pride themselves more than anything upon keeping their word in
  love and in hate. You can scarcely understand their fierce passionate nature.
  I have always felt that when the day of his release came he would remember
  his oath, and strive to work some evil upon us."</p>

  <p>Lord St. Maurice passed his arm around his wife's waist, with a reassuring
  smile.</p>

  <p>"It is five-and-twenty years ago, love. Is not that enough to set your
  fears at rest?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him without a smile, grave and serious.</p>

  <p>"The five-and-twenty years are up, Geoffrey. Leonardo is free!"</p>

  <p>"What of it?" he answered carelessly. "If he has not forgotten us
  altogether, what harm could he do us?"</p>

  <p>She clasped her hands around his neck, and looked into his face.</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey, I have a confession to make," she whispered. "Will you forgive
  me?"</p>

  <p>"It's a rash promise, but I'll chance it," he answered, smoothing her hair
  and smiling down into her upturned face.</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey, he is in London. I have seen him."</p>

  <p>He looked a little surprised, but he did not draw away.</p>

  <p>"Seen him! Where? When?"</p>

  <p>"Do you remember the day when I was to have called for you at the
  'Travelers,' and you waited for me, and I did not come? Yes, I know that you
  do. Well, I did come, really, but as I sat in the carriage waiting, I took up
  the <i>Morning Post</i> and I read an advertisement there, signed by the
  manager of the Continental Hotel. It was inquiring for any friend or relative
  of Count Leonardo di Marioni, who was lying there dangerously ill and alone.
  Geoffrey, of course I ought to have waited for you, but I am impulsive
  sometimes, and I was then. I thought that if I could see him alone for the
  first time, that I might win his forgiveness, and so I drove there at once.
  They showed me into his room; he was sitting over the fire, a miserable,
  shrunken little figure, wasted to a shadow. Ah, how my heart ached to see
  him. Geoffrey, I knelt by his side; I spoke to him as tenderly as I could to
  one of my own children; and then he turned a white corpse-like face upon me,
  and spoke words which God grant I may some day forget. I do not believe that
  human lips have ever framed such hideous curses. How I got down to the
  carriage, I do not know. You are not angry with me, Geoffrey?"</p>

  <p>"Angry? why no, love," he answered tenderly. "You did it for the best.
  What a vindictive little beggar."</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey, I can't help thinking that some day, if he recovers, he will
  try to do you or me a mischief."</p>

  <p>Lord St. Maurice laughed outright.</p>

  <p>"We are not in Sicily," he answered lightly.</p>

  <p>"What could he do to either of us? Am I not big enough to protect myself,
  and take care of you? I tell you what, Adrienne, why shouldn't I go and see
  him when I am in London next week?"</p>

  <p>"You!" She shuddered and clasped him tightly. "Geoffrey, promise me at
  once that you will not go near him," she begged. "Promise me!"</p>

  <p>"On one condition."</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>"That you will give up troubling about this nonsense."</p>

  <p>"I will try," she promised.</p>

  <p>"That's right. Now put on your hat, and come for a run on the cliff. I
  can't have you looking so pale."</p>

  <p>He walked to the door with her and opened it, kissing her forehead as she
  passed through. She looked up at him fondly, and the quiet pleasure which
  glowed for a moment in her cheeks and shone in her eyes made her look once
  more like a girl of twenty. A woman's greatest happiness had been hers. In
  middle age her husband was still her lover.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me for being silly," she whispered. "I can't help it. Our life
  has been so happy that I cannot bear to think of a cloud of any sort coming
  over it, even for a very short while."</p>

  <p>"The only cloud we have to fear is that big fellow yonder over Gorton
  point," he laughed.</p>

  <p>"Better bring your mackintosh down. I shall not shoot to-day until I have
  seen some color in your cheeks."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chXIX"
     id="chXIX"></a>XIX.&mdash;THE NEW GOVERNESS</h2>

  <p class="first">None of the little household at Mallory Grange, Lord St.
  Maurice's Norfolk seat, ever forgot Margharita's first appearance among them.
  She came late in the afternoon, and was shown into Lady St. Maurice's own
  little sitting room, without the ceremony of an announcement. Lady St.
  Maurice had many kind words ready to say, but the sight of the figure who
  crossed the threshold, and came out of the dusk toward the center of the
  room, struck her dumb. She stood up for a moment perfectly silent, with her
  hand pressed to her side. Such a likeness was marvelous. In this girl's
  proud, dark face she could recall Leonardo's features one by one. The air
  seemed suddenly full of voices, sobbing and cursing and threatening. Then she
  came to herself, and held out her hand&mdash;forced her lips even to wear a
  kindly welcoming smile.</p>

  <p>"I am so glad to have you here, Margharita," she said. "Do you know that
  your likeness to your mother&mdash;and her family&mdash;has startled me. It
  is wonderful."</p>

  <p>"It is very nice to hear you say so," the girl answered, taking the chair
  which, at Lady St. Maurice's motion, a servant had wheeled up to the fire. "I
  like to think of myself as belonging altogether to my mother and her people.
  I have been very unhappy with my father's relations."</p>

  <p>"I am only sorry that you remained with them so long," Lady St. Maurice
  said. "Let me give you some tea, and then you must tell me why you never
  wrote to me before."</p>

  <p>"Because I made up my mind to bear it as long as I was able," she
  answered. "I have done so. It was impossible for me to remain there any
  longer, and I determined to take my life into my own hands, and, if
  necessary, find a situation. I wrote first to you, and you have been kind
  enough to engage me."</p>

  <p>To Lady St. Maurice, who was a woman of genial manners and kindly
  disposition, there seemed to be a curious hardness in the girl's tone and
  mode of expressing herself. She had avoided the kiss with which she had been
  prepared to greet her, and had shaken hands in the most matter-of-fact way.
  This last phrase, too, was a little ungracious.</p>

  <p>"Engage you! I hope you are not going to look upon our little arrangement
  in that light," Lady St. Maurice said pleasantly. "For your mother's sake,
  Margharita, I should have been only too glad to have welcomed you here at any
  time as my daughter, and I hope that when we know one another better, you
  will not be quite so independent. Don't be afraid," she added, "you shall
  have your own way at first. Some day I hope that you will come round to
  mine."</p>

  <p>Margharita sipped her tea quietly, and made no reply; but in the firelight
  her dark eyes glowed softly and brightly, and Lady St. Maurice was quite
  satisfied with her silence. For a few moments neither of them spoke. Then
  Lady St. Maurice leaned back in her chair, away from the firelight, and asked
  a question.</p>

  <p>"Did you know that the Count di Marioni, your uncle, was in London?"</p>

  <p>"I knew that he had been there," Margharita answered in a low tone.</p>

  <p>"Had been! Has he gone away?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," the girl continued, looking steadily at her questioner.
  "Yesterday I called to see him at a hotel in Piccadilly, and they told me
  that he had left that morning for abroad. I was sorry to be too late."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Lady St. Maurice asked no more. The dark eyes seemed to be trying to
  pierce the dusk between them, and read her face. She turned the conversation,
  and asked a few questions about the journey. Afterward would be time enough
  to find out how much this girl knew.</p>

  <p>Soon Lord St. Maurice came in from shooting, wet to the skin, and stood by
  the fire, drinking his tea and talking pleasantly to Margharita and his wife.
  She talked more readily to him than to Lady St. Maurice, but in the middle of
  the conversation she checked herself and stood up.</p>

  <p>"I am tired," she said abruptly. "May I go to my room?"</p>

  <p>Lady St. Maurice took her away herself, and showed her the suite which had
  been prepared for her. There was a bedroom, a daintily furnished little
  sitting room, and a bath room, all looking out upon the sea. A bright fire
  had been lit in both the rooms, and bowls of flowers and many little feminine
  trifles helped to unite comfort to undoubted luxury. Margharita went from one
  to the other without remark.</p>

  <p>"These are far too nice," she said simply, when Lady St. Maurice turned to
  go. "I have not been used to such luxury."</p>

  <p>Lady St. Maurice left her with a sigh, and went downstairs. She had hoped
  to see the cold proud face relax a little at the many signs of thought in the
  preparations which had been made for her, and she was disappointed. She
  entered her sitting room thoughtfully, and went up to her husband.</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey, she is horribly like him."</p>

  <p>"If poor Marioni had had this girl's looks I should have felt more
  jealous," he answered lightly. "I'm almost sorry Lumley is here."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"She is beautiful, but I don't think Lumley will admire her. He places
  expression before everything, and this girl has none. She must have been very
  unhappy, I think, or else she is very heartless!"</p>

  <p>He stood with his back to the fire, twisting his mustache and warming
  himself.</p>

  <p>"The fact is," he remarked, "you're disappointed because she didn't jump
  into your arms and cry a little, and all that sort of thing. Now, I respect
  the girl for it; for I think she was acting under constraint. Give her time,
  Adrienne, and I think you'll find her sympathetic enough. And as to the
  expression&mdash;well, I may be mistaken, but I should say that she had a
  sweeter one than most women, although we haven't seen it yet. Give her time,
  Adrienne. Don't hurry her."</p>

  <p>It was two hours before they saw her again, and then she came into the
  drawing room just as the dinner gong was going. Neither of them had seen her
  save by the dim light of a single lamp, and even then she had been wrapped in
  a long traveling coat; and so, although Lord St. Maurice had called her
  beautiful, they were neither of them prepared to see her quite as she was.
  She wore a plain black net dinner gown, curving only slightly downward at the
  white throat, the somberness of which was partially relieved by an amber
  foundation. She had no jewelry of any sort, nor any flowers, and she carried
  only a tiny lace handkerchief in her left hand. But she had no need of a
  toilet or of adornment. That proud, exquisitely graceful carriage, which only
  race can give, was the dowry of her descent from one of the ancient families
  of Southern Europe; but the beauty of her face was nature's gift alone. It
  was beauty of the best and purest French type&mdash;the beauty of the
  aristocrats of the court of Louis the Fourteenth. The luxurious black hair
  was parted in the middle, and raised slightly over the temples, showing a
  high but delicately arched forehead. Her complexion was dazzling in its
  purity, but colorless. There was none of the harshness of the Sicilian type
  in her features, or in the lines of her figure. The severest critic of
  feminine beauty could have asked only for a slightly relaxed mouth, and a
  touch of humanity in her dark, still eyes; and even he, knowing that the
  great joys of womanhood&mdash;the joys of loving and being loved&mdash;were
  as yet untasted by her, would have held his peace, murmuring, perhaps, that
  the days of miracles were not yet passed, and a daughter of Diana had
  appeared upon the earth.</p>

  <p>The little group, to whom her entrance was something like a thunderbolt,
  consisted only of Lord and Lady St. Maurice, and their son, Lord Lumley. He,
  although his surprise was the greatest, was the first to recover from it.</p>

  <p>"I am happy to meet you in proper form, Miss Briscoe," he said, bowing,
  and then looking into her face with a humorous light in his eyes. "I was
  afraid that I should never have the opportunity of telling you that those
  fellows met with, at any rate, a part of what they deserved. I saw them
  locked up."</p>

  <p>She looked at him for a moment with slightly arched eyebrows, and then
  suddenly smiled.</p>

  <p>"Oh! is it really you?" she exclaimed, holding out her hand, which she had
  not previously offered. "I am so glad. I was afraid that I should never have
  the opportunity to thank you for your kindness."</p>

  <p>"You have met Lumley before, then?" asked Lady St. Maurice, wondering.</p>

  <p>"Scarcely so much as that," he answered, laughing. "Don't you remember my
  telling you of my adventure in Piccadilly, mother?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I remember. Do you mean that the young lady was really
  Margharita?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him, and he colored slightly. For the first time he
  remembered how enthusiastically he had spoken of the girl whom he had
  assisted, and Lady St. Maurice remembered, too, that for several days
  afterward he had been silent and distrait. She could not fail to remember it,
  for it was the first time she had ever heard Lumley admire a girl in such
  terms.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was Miss Briscoe," he answered, keeping his head turned away from
  his mother.</p>

  <p>"It was indeed I," she admitted. "I don't know what I should have done,
  but for your help, Lord Lumley. I am afraid that I should have screamed and
  made a scene."</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine your doing it!" he remarked truthfully.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not! But I was so surprised, I could not understand it."</p>

  <p>"May I remind you that I am completely in the dark as to this little
  adventure," Lord St. Maurice remarked pleasantly. "What was it, Lumley?"</p>

  <p>"A very simple affair after all. I was in Piccadilly, and Miss Briscoe
  here was coming out of some milliner's shop and crossing the pavement to her
  carriage."</p>

  <p>"Cab!" she interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Cab, then. Well, it was late in the afternoon, and two drunken little
  cads tried to speak to her. Naturally, as I was the nearest decent person, I
  interfered and assisted Miss Briscoe into her cab. That I was passing was a
  piece of good fortune for which I have always been thankful."</p>

  <p>"Lord Lumley does not add that his interference consisted in knocking one
  man down and holding the other until he almost choked with one hand, while he
  helped me into the cab with the other."</p>

  <p>"I only shook him a little," he laughed, giving his mother his arm, for
  the butler had announced dinner while they had been talking. "If I had been
  he I would rather have had the shaking than the look Miss Briscoe flashed at
  him."</p>

  <p>"I detest being touched," she said coldly, "especially by a stranger."</p>

  <p>"How did the affair end?" Lord St. Maurice asked, sipping his soup. "I
  hope you got them locked up, Lumley."</p>

  <p>"Why, the termination of the affair was the part on which I do really
  congratulate myself," he answered. "A policeman came up at once, but before I
  could give them in charge&mdash;in which case I should, of course, have been
  called upon to prosecute and got generally mixed up in the affair&mdash;one
  of the fellows began thumping the policeman; so of course he collared them
  and marched them off. I slipped away, and I noticed the next morning that
  they got pretty heavily fined for assaulting a policeman in the execution of
  his duty."</p>

  <p>"A satisfactory ending to a most unpleasant affair," Lord St. Maurice
  remarked.</p>

  <p>During dinner Lord Lumley devoted himself to their guest, but for a long
  time the burden of the conversation lay altogether upon his shoulders. It was
  not until he chanced to mention the National Gallery, in connection with the
  season's exhibition of pictures, that Margharita abandoned her monosyllabic
  answers and generally reserved demeanor. He saw at once that he had struck
  the right note, and he followed it up with tact. He was fresh from a tour
  among the galleries of southern Europe and Holland, and he himself was no
  mean artist. But Margharita, he soon found, knew nothing of recent art. She
  was hopelessly out of date. She knew nothing of the modern cant, of the
  nineteenth century philistinism, at which it was so much the fashion to
  scoff. She had not caught the froth of the afternoon talk at fashionable
  studios, and, having jumbled it together in the popular fashion, she was not
  prepared to set forth her views on art in somebody else's pet phrases. Lord
  Lumley had met that sort of young lady, and had shunned her. Margharita had
  simply acquired from a hurried visit to Italy, when she was quite young, a
  dim but vast appreciation of the soul of the great masters. She could not
  have defined art, nor could she have expressed in a few nicely-rounded
  sentences her opinion of Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece, or of the genius of
  Pico della Mirandola. But she felt that a great world lay beyond a larger
  knowledge and understanding of these things, and some day she hoped, after
  time, and thought, and study, to enter it.</p>

  <p>And Lord Lumley, reading her thoughts with a keen and intuitive sympathy,
  talked to her that night at dinner and afterward in a corner of the perfumed
  rose-lit drawing room, as no man had ever talked to her before&mdash;talked
  to her so earnestly, and with so much effect, that Lady St. Maurice rose from
  her writing table at the other end of the room, watched them with pale and
  troubled face, and more than once made some faint effort to disturb them. He
  showed her the systems and manner of thought by which the dimly-felt,
  wondering admiration of the uncultured, yet sensitive, mind can develop into
  the large and soul-felt appreciation of the artist. It was the keys of her
  promised land which he held out to her with winning speech and a kindliness
  to which she was unaccustomed. He was young himself, but he had all the
  advantages of correct training, of travel, and of delicate artistic
  sensibilities. He had taught himself much, and fresh from the task of
  learning, he had all the best enthusiasm of the teacher. He had told himself
  that he, too, like the Athenians, worshiped beauty, but never in his life had
  he seen anything so beautiful as Margharita's face as she listened to him.
  Spiritual life seemed to have been poured into a piece of beautiful imagery.
  Her lips were parted and her dark eyes were softened. It was the face of a
  St. Cecilia. How long before it would become the face of a woman!</p>

  <p>It was Lord St. Maurice's arrival which dissolved the spell. He had missed
  his after-dinner cigar and chat with Lumley, and directly he entered the
  drawing room he saw the cause. Adrienne's eyes and his met. A little annoyed
  by his son's defection he did not hesitate to act.</p>

  <p>"Miss Briscoe, are you too tired, or may we ask for a little music?" he
  said, walking up to the pair.</p>

  <p>She looked up, frowning a little at the interruption. Then a swift
  recollection of her position came to her, and the light died out of her face.
  She rose at once.</p>

  <p>"I shall be pleased to do what I can. I sing a little, but I play
  badly."</p>

  <p>She affected not to notice Lord St Maurice's arm, but crossed the room by
  his side toward the piano. He opened it, arranged the stool, and remained
  standing there.</p>

  <p>She struck a few minor chords, and suddenly the room seemed full of a sad,
  plaintive music rising gradually to a higher pitch, and then dying away as
  her voice took up the melody and carried it on. Lady St. Maurice held her
  hand to her side for a moment, and her husband frowned. It was a Sicilian
  love song which she was singing; the song of a peasant whose bride lies dead
  by his side, the victim of another's jealousy. Adrienne had heard it often in
  the old days, and the beautiful wild music which rang in their ears was full
  of memories to her. It closed abruptly, and only Lumley, with an unusual
  sparkle in his eyes, found words to thank her.</p>

  <p>"Are all your songs sad ones, Miss Briscoe?" Lord St. Maurice asked
  abruptly. "Can't you offer us something in the shape of an antidote?"</p>

  <p>She sat down at the piano again.</p>

  <p>"I do not know anything gay," she said. "I can only sing what I feel. I
  will play something."</p>

  <p>She dashed off into a light Hungarian dance, full of <i>verve</i> and
  sparkle, and Lord St. Maurice kept time with his foot, smiling approvingly.
  Directly it was over she closed the piano and turned to Lady St. Maurice.</p>

  <p>"If I may I should be glad to go to my room now," she said. "I had no idea
  it was so late."</p>

  <p>Lumley held the door open for her, and felt unreasonably disappointed
  because she passed out with a slight inclination of the head, but without
  looking at him. Then he turned back into the room, and they all three looked
  at one another for a moment.</p>

  <p>"She is marvelously handsome," Lord St. Maurice pronounced.</p>

  <p>"Marvelously!" his son echoed softly.</p>

  <p>But Lady St. Maurice said nothing.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chXX"
     id="chXX"></a>XX.&mdash;LORD LUMLEY AND MARGHARITA</h2>

  <p class="first">"Geoffrey, come here for a moment!"</p>

  <p>The Earl of St. Maurice, who was a most obedient husband, folded up his
  paper and joined his wife at the window.</p>

  <p>"Well, dear."</p>

  <p>"Look there."</p>

  <p>He followed her finger. It pointed to three figures; a man in shooting
  clothes, with a gun under his arm, a girl and a child between them, strolling
  along the cliffs outside the grounds. He glanced at them carelessly, and back
  into his wife's face as though for an explanation.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"This is the third morning that Lumley has joined Margharita and Gracie in
  their walk."</p>

  <p>"Very good natured of him," the Earl replied carelessly. "He always was
  fond of Gracie though, wasn't he?"</p>

  <p>"I wish I could feel sure that it was entirely for Gracie's sake," she
  answered anxiously.</p>

  <p>Her husband whistled, and his brows contracted a little.</p>

  <p>"You mean to suggest, I suppose, that Miss Briscoe is the attraction," he
  remarked thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"How can I help thinking so? Both yesterday and this morning he was in the
  schoolroom until I heard her tell him quite severely that he must go, as he
  was interrupting their work. Both mornings I have asked him to drive with me,
  and each time he made an excuse. If Margharita's name is mentioned before
  him, he is either unusually silent and reserved, or very talkative. As a
  rule, you know, Lumley does not care for girls. That makes me all the more
  anxious."</p>

  <p>"Miss Briscoe is certainly wonderfully beautiful," he said. "Yet I think
  that Lumley has common sense."</p>

  <p>"He has peculiar ideas," his wife answered. "I have always been afraid of
  his doing something <i>bizarre</i>, and as you say, Margharita is wonderfully
  beautiful&mdash;far more so than her mother, I think. What would you advise
  me to do, Geoffrey?"</p>

  <p>He stroked his long gray mustache, and looked thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"It's a delicate matter," he said. "To even hint at the girl going away
  because Lumley admires her would be unjust, and, at the same time, if Lumley
  got an inkling of the reason it would certainly make him think more of her
  than he does now. You have no fault to find with her in any way?"</p>

  <p>"None! absolutely none! Her behavior is perfect. She is proud, but I do
  not consider that a fault. Her manners are the manners of a perfectly-bred
  lady."</p>

  <p>"And Gracie likes her?"</p>

  <p>"Gracie adores her!"</p>

  <p>"She certainly doesn't attempt to encourage Lumley in any way," the Earl
  continued thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Her manners and behavior, in fact, her whole conduct, is perfectly
  irreproachable," Lady St. Maurice acknowledged. "In certain ways she has been
  a great disappointment to me, but I wish to be just to her, and I feel bound
  to say so. It makes the situation all the more difficult."</p>

  <p>"In that case we can do nothing," her husband said decidedly. "Things must
  take their course. If they develop, as we will hope they may not, I will
  speak to Lumley privately."</p>

  <p>"You see she is coming back because Lumley has joined them," Lady St.
  Maurice said. "Geoffrey, look at her now at the top of that hill. Does she
  not remind you of him?"</p>

  <p>He took up a pair of field glasses from the table and looked at her
  steadily.</p>

  <p>"Yes, she does," he admitted. "She is just like that poor fellow Marioni
  sometimes. I never noticed it so clearly."</p>

  <p>"She is horribly like him, and, Geoffrey, it is foolish of me, but
  sometimes she looks at me with his eyes. It makes me shiver."</p>

  <p>"Foolish little woman! Why, you are actually nursing your fears."</p>

  <p>"They are scarcely fears; only a stupid sort of foreboding that comes on
  sometimes, and which, afterward, I look upon as morbid. It is foolish of me,
  I know, to connect them with Margharita, and yet I can't help it sometimes.
  She is so like him."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you ask her if she knows anything about him, or where he is?
  Surely you might do that."</p>

  <p>"I have made up my mind to more than once, but really, Geoffrey, absurd
  though it may sound, I have never felt quite at ease in asking Margharita
  personal questions. She so obviously insists upon our relations remaining
  exactly those of employer and employed. It was not at all what I intended;
  but what can I do? I wish to be a friend to her, but her manner quite forbids
  it. She is far prouder than I am."</p>

  <p>Lord St. Maurice shrugged his shoulders and kissed his wife's
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't trouble about it, dear. They are a headstrong, intractable
  race, those Marionis, and this girl takes after her mother. Treat her kindly
  and she'll come round some day. Come and sit in the library if you have
  nothing better to do for half an hour. I have some stupid letters to
  write."</p>

  <p>"I will come in one moment, Geoffrey," she answered. "I may as well clear
  off some of my correspondence debts. There are some invitations to answer,
  too."</p>

  <p>Lord St. Maurice left the room and Adrienne remained by the window, her
  eyes fixed upon the little group which had come to a standstill now on the
  summit of the low line of cliffs. The field glasses were still on the table
  by her side, and raising them to her eyes, she watched them steadfastly for
  several minutes. When she put them down she was a shade paler, and there were
  tears in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"If I thought that it would wipe out the past," she murmured, "after all
  it might be well. But how can it? He will never forgive! Never! never!"</p>

  <p>She turned away, brushing the tears from her eyes, and went into her
  husband's room smiling and comely. Such sorrows as she had were not for him
  to share&mdash;not even for him to know of. The burden of them was for her
  alone.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">And, meanwhile, Lord Lumley, her only son, was leaning
  against the trunk of a pine tree on the brow of the cliff, with something
  very much like a frown upon his forehead; and a little distance away,
  Margharita was calmly reading to Gracie out of a French picture book,
  brought, as Lord Lumley had been quick to surmise, chiefly with a view of
  excluding him from their company. It was quite true, as his father had
  remarked, that he had received very little encouragement from Margharita; in
  fact, he had been told somewhat plainly, a few minutes ago, that his presence
  was interfering with the lesson. "As if there was any necessity to bring
  lesson books out of doors," he had muttered <i>sotto voce</i>, withdrawing
  himself a few yards, however, and relapsing into an irritated silence. The
  book had been brought on his account altogether. There was no doubt whatever
  about that, and, manlike, he felt aggrieved. Of course he ought to have gone
  away at once, and he had started with that intention, but the sound of
  Margharita's voice arrested him before he had gone half a dozen yards. After
  all, it would be pleasanter to stay and listen.</p>

  <p>So he stood there, crumpling up a sprig of heather in his hand, and
  ostensibly waiting for a shot at a sea gull. He was quite aware that no sea
  gull was likely to rise anywhere near, and that his gun was unloaded, but the
  excuse was the only one that had occurred to him at a minute's notice. His
  real object in remaining was that he might walk home with Margharita when the
  lesson was over.</p>

  <p>The Earl of St. Maurice had been a handsome man in his youth, but his son
  was handsomer. To the fine Saxon physique of the St. Maurices, in Lord Lumley
  had been added something of the more delicate beauty of his mother. He had
  the long limbs and broad shoulders of which a gallery full of St. Maurices
  boasted, but his features were more delicately formed, and his forehead was
  higher and more intellectual than any of them.</p>

  <p>Yet it had not in any way spoiled him. He had not an atom of conceit or
  pride of any sort. At college, where he had graduated early, he presented the
  rare combination of a nobleman's son, a moderate athlete, and a hard reading
  man. His had been the intellectual set of the whole university, and having
  the rare gift of attaining an unsought influence over most of those with whom
  he was brought into contact, he had imparted a distinctly scholarly tone to
  the little circle which he had formed. Men of all grades spoke well of him.
  He was reserved, and he was not a prig; he was consistent to his own ideals,
  and yet not censorious. He was possessed of an agreeable and even winning
  manner, and yet he had rather avoided the society of women than otherwise.
  The consequence was that, at twenty-four, he had the thoughtful intellectual
  air of a much older man.</p>

  <p>The lesson came to an end at last, and the three strolled down toward the
  house together. Lord Lumley had joined them because there was something which
  he was determined to say.</p>

  <p>"Miss Briscoe," he began, during a momentary halt while they watched a
  yacht tacking in the bay below, "may I ask you a question?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," she answered carelessly, without looking at him.</p>

  <p>"You are beginning to avoid me."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!"</p>

  <p>"You brought that wretched book out this morning as an excuse to get rid
  of me."</p>

  <p>"Well, if I did, you should certainly relieve me of the necessity, should
  you not?"</p>

  <p>"You know that you did. And, yesterday morning, if Gracie had not pleaded
  to stay out a little longer, you would have cut your work short because of my
  presence."</p>

  <p>"Then, if you think so, Lord Lumley, it is clearly your duty to go away,
  as I reminded you just now."</p>

  <p>"Thanks. I wonder why the path of duty is always so disagreeable."</p>

  <p>She did not answer him; but, taking Gracie by the hand, turned homeward.
  He kept his place by her side, heedless of the angry glance which she flashed
  upon him.</p>

  <p>"I want to know why you object to my society so much, Miss Briscoe?" he
  said presently.</p>

  <p>"There are a great many things we want to know in this world which we
  don't know," she answered. "Where we go to after we die, for instance. We
  have to be patient, and wait till we find out."</p>

  <p>"Then you won't tell me?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I? But if you really want to know, the reason is simple
  enough. I have been used to solitude. I prefer it. If I cannot have it
  absolutely I can have it comparatively, at any rate."</p>

  <p>"With Gracie?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly."</p>

  <p>"You are complimentary," he laughed.</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Why should I not tell the truth when there is nothing to be gained by
  telling a falsehood?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her gravely.</p>

  <p>"That sounds cynical, Miss Briscoe."</p>

  <p>"I am indifferent as to its sound," she answered. "Hadn't you better go
  and shoot something?"</p>

  <p>He did not notice her suggestion.</p>

  <p>"Miss Briscoe, I do not like the way in which we are talking.
  I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The remedy is obvious," she interrupted haughtily.</p>

  <p>"Probably the fault is mine," he continued, calmly ignoring her speech. "I
  have not been used to talking to girls much. My friends have all been men,
  and I daresay that I have got into the habit, therefore, of expressing myself
  clumsily. But what I want to say to you, if you will give me the opportunity,
  is this: The first few evenings after your arrival here were very pleasant
  ones indeed&mdash;for me. You talked to me, and I found more pleasure in our
  conversation than I have ever done in anything else in my life. There, that
  is being frank, is it not? I hoped that we might be friends; indeed, it
  seemed to me that we were certainly going to be so. I do not wish to offend
  you by any apparent exaggeration, but I must say that it made a considerable
  difference to my interest in life. That is putting it mildly. Where you have
  found the time to read and think so much, of course, I cannot tell. It is not
  my business. Only, I know that it makes your companionship very pleasant for
  me. You see I am trying to be as matter-of-fact as possible&mdash;do please
  give me credit for that. I just want to know why you have altered your manner
  to me; why we cannot be friends? Will you tell me, please, Miss Briscoe?"</p>

  <p>His pleading tone had a manly musical ring in it which was very pleasant
  to listen to, and in his anxiety for her answer he had stooped down until his
  dark handsome head nearly touched hers. She drew away impatiently.</p>

  <p>"That is impossible," she said coldly.</p>

  <p>"And why?"</p>

  <p>"If for no other reason, surely the Countess of St. Maurice's governess is
  no suitable friend for Lord Lumley."</p>

  <p>He colored under the intense hauteur of her words.</p>

  <p>"You will forgive my saying that that is the first remark which I have
  heard from you, Miss Briscoe, which has not been in good taste. Good-morning.
  Good-bye, Gracie."</p>

  <p>He turned abruptly along a private path through the pine wood. Margharita
  and her charge went on up to the house alone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chXXI"
     id="chXXI"></a>XXI.&mdash;A LAND THAT IS LONELIER THAN RUIN</h2>

  <p class="first">Late in the afternoon of the same day they met again, and
  this time really by accident. Since morning a storm had been blowing, but
  just before sunset the wind and rain had dropped, and an angry sun glared out
  in its last moments upon the troubled sea. Lord Lumley, tired of struggling
  with a pile of books and smoking cigarettes, had seen the change from his
  study window, and seizing his cap and a stick had hurried out to taste the
  strong salt wind and to watch the cloud effects from the cliffs; and, as he
  had rounded the corner, he had come face to face with Margharita.</p>

  <p>She was standing on the highest point of the cliffs, her skirts blowing
  wildly around her tall, slim figure, and making strange havoc with her hair.
  Her face was turned seaward, but at the sound of his footsteps she turned
  quickly round. His heart beat fast for a moment, and then he remembered their
  parting earlier in the day.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to have disturbed you," he said coldly, raising his cap. "If I
  had had the least idea that you were here I would have taken the other
  path."</p>

  <p>He was passing on, but as she made him no answer he glanced up at her
  face. Then all thought of going vanished. There were glistening tears in her
  dark eyes, and her lips were quivering.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me, Miss Briscoe," he said, springing up to her side. "I was a
  clumsy idiot, but I was afraid that you would think that I had followed you.
  May I stay?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, and turned her face away from him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, stay," she answered softly; "stay and talk to me. Don't think me
  silly, but I was feeling sad&mdash;lonely, perhaps&mdash;and you have always
  spoken so kindly to me, that the change&mdash;it was a little too
  sudden."</p>

  <p>"I was a brute," he whispered gently.</p>

  <p>The change in her was wonderful. Her voice was soft, and, glancing up at
  her face, he could see that it was stained with tears. At that moment he felt
  that he would have given the world to have taken her into his arms and held
  her there, but he thrust the thought resolutely from him. Now was his
  opportunity to teach her to trust him. He would not even suffer his voice to
  take too tender a note.</p>

  <p>"The fresh air is glorious after a day cooped up in a little study," he
  said lightly. "See the curlews there, flying round and round over the
  marshes. Tennyson's old home lies that way, you know. Do you wonder that this
  flat country, with its strange twilight effects, should have laid hold of him
  so powerfully?"</p>

  <p>"It is strange and weird," she murmured thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Weird is the very word for it. Tennyson might have written that lovely
  but hackneyed poem, 'Locksley Hall,' from this very spot. The place seems
  born to evoke sentiment, and a stormy twilight like this seems to fit in with
  it. It is not a fair-weather land. People come here in the summer, and call
  the place flat and uninteresting. One can scarcely wonder at it."</p>

  <p>"It is a sad-looking country," she said. "It was its sadness which brought
  me out this afternoon; <i>similia similibus curantur</i>, you know; but in my
  case it has failed."</p>

  <p>"And why should you be sad?" he asked softly. "Won't you give me a little
  of your confidence?"</p>

  <p>She smiled bitterly, and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, you could never know. Ask me no questions; only leave me alone. Talk
  to me of other things, if you will. My thoughts are bad companions to-night.
  I do not want to be left alone with them. Do you know any of Swinburne's
  'Salt Marshes'?"</p>

  <p>"A little."</p>

  <p>"Say it to me. I want to escape from my thoughts."</p>

  <p>He obeyed her, standing up by her side and watching the wild music of the
  poetry kindle her imagination and work into her heart. He understood the
  situation now. She was oppressed by some great trouble, and he must help her
  to forget it. And so, when he had come to the last line, he talked to her
  softly of it, pointing out the strange lights on the sea, and the shadows
  lying across the desolate country. Soon he drifted into verse again,
  striving, so far as he could, to avoid the poetry of pessimism and despair,
  so beautiful and yet so noxious, and strike a more joyous and hopeful note.
  Soon he found himself at "Maud," and here he was fluent, but here she stopped
  him, warned perhaps by the light which was creeping into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Let us go home now," she said. "You have been very kind to me. I shall
  never forget it."</p>

  <p>He gave her his hand, and they scrambled down on to the path. They
  retraced their steps toward the house almost in silence. He was only fearful
  of losing one particle of the advantage which he had gained. The fear of not
  seeing her again, however, gave him courage.</p>

  <p>"May I ask a favor?" he begged humbly.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Make it a small one, please. I am almost afraid of having to refuse
  it."</p>

  <p>"Will you come down into the drawing room to-night?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I cannot. I have a long letter to write."</p>

  <p>His face fell.</p>

  <p>"For just a short time, then."</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Yes, if you wish it."</p>

  <p>"We are friends now, are we not?" anxiously.</p>

  <p>She flashed a brilliant look upon him, which made the color steal into his
  cheeks, and his heart beat fast.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said softly, "if you will."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chXXII"
     id="chXXII"></a>XXII.&mdash;LORD LUMLEY'S CONFESSION</h2>

  <p class="first">"Mother, don't you think that Miss Briscoe is a very strange
  girl?"</p>

  <p>Lady St. Maurice looked up from her work quickly. Nine o'clock was just
  striking, and her son only a moment before had replaced his watch in his
  pocket with an impatient little gesture.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do think so," she answered quietly. "I think her very strange
  indeed. Why do you ask me?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know exactly. It seems odd that she should want to spend all
  her evening alone, and that she should have so many long letters to write. Do
  you think that she quite understands that you would like her to come down
  with us?"</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure that she does, Lumley. I even objected to having her come
  here as a governess at all. Her mother was a dear friend of mine many years
  ago, and I told Margharita from the first that I would rather have her here
  as my daughter. She would have been very welcome to a home with us. It was
  only her pride which made her insist upon coming as Gracie's governess, and I
  suppose it is the same feeling which prompts her to keep herself so much
  aloof from us. I am sorry, but I can do no more than I have done toward
  making her see things differently."</p>

  <p>Lord Lumley fidgeted about for a minute or two on the hearthrug. There was
  a certain reserve in his mother's manner which made the task which he had set
  himself more difficult even than it would have been under ordinary
  circumstances. Besides, he felt that from her low seat she was watching him
  intently, and the knowledge did not tend toward setting him more at his
  ease.</p>

  <p>"You loved her mother, then?"</p>

  <p>"I did. She was my dearest friend."</p>

  <p>"And yet&mdash;forgive me if I am wrong&mdash;but sometimes I fancy that
  you do not even like Miss Briscoe."</p>

  <p>"She will not let me like or dislike her, Lumley."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It isn't that exactly. I have seen you watching her sometimes&mdash;as
  for instance when she sang that Sicilian song here&mdash;as though you
  were&mdash;well, almost afraid of her; as though there was something about
  her which almost repelled you."</p>

  <p>The Countess laid down her work, and looked steadfastly into the fire.
  There was a moment's silence.</p>

  <p>"You have been a close watcher, Lumley."</p>

  <p>"I admit it. But, tell me, have I not watched to some purpose. There is no
  mistaking the look in your face sometimes, when she comes into the room
  unexpectedly. If the thing were not absurd, I should say that you were afraid
  of her."</p>

  <p>Lady St. Maurice held her hand to her side for a moment, as though she
  felt a sudden pain. She repeated her son's words without looking up at
  him.</p>

  <p>"Afraid of her! No, no, Lumley. I am afraid of something else, something
  of which her face continually reminds me. It is the shadow of the past which
  seems to follow her footsteps."</p>

  <p>A tragic note had suddenly been struck in the conversation between mother
  and son. Lord Lumley, who had been altogether unprepared for it, was full of
  interest.</p>

  <p>"The past!" he repeated. "Whose past? Tell me all about it, mother."</p>

  <p>She looked up at him, and he saw that her face was unusually pale.</p>

  <p>"Lumley, it is only a little while ago since your father and I told you
  the story of our strange meeting and marriage. You remember it?"</p>

  <p>"Every word! Every word, mother!"</p>

  <p>"You remember the duel which the Count di Marioni sought to force upon
  your father, but which I prevented? You remember the means which I was driven
  to use to prevent it, and the oath of vengeance which Leonardo&mdash;the
  Count di Marioni&mdash;swore against us both?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Lumley, twenty-five years have passed away, and he is free."</p>

  <p>"But, Miss Briscoe?" he asked, bewildered. "How does all this concern
  her?"</p>

  <p>"She is his niece."</p>

  <p>"His niece! his niece!"</p>

  <p>Lord Lumley could say nothing. With all the swift selfishness of a man his
  thoughts were centered round one point. Would this new development hinder his
  purpose, or was it favorable to him?</p>

  <p>"Leonardo's sister, Lumley, was my dear friend. She married a man named
  Briscoe, and died very soon afterward. Margharita is their daughter, and,
  Lumley, there is no English blood in her veins. She is a Marioni! I can see
  his eyes and his forehead every time I look at hers. They seem to tell me
  that that wild oath still lives; that some day he will stretch out his hand
  and redeem that murderous threat. Lumley, there have been times when it has
  terrified me to look at that girl."</p>

  <p>His face was clearing. A smile even began to dawn upon his lips.</p>

  <p>"Why, mother, don't you see that so far as Miss Briscoe is concerned that
  is all fancy," he said. "You feel in that way toward her simply because she
  happens to resemble the Count di Marioni. Isn't that a little unfair to her?
  What can she know of an oath which was sworn five-and-twenty years ago, long
  before she was born. Why, I don't suppose that she ever heard of it."</p>

  <p>She smiled a little sadly.</p>

  <p>"Lumley, I do not attempt to defend my feeling. Of course it is absurd to
  connect her with it, really."</p>

  <p>"I was sure that you would say so, mother."</p>

  <p>"But, Lumley, although I cannot defend it the feeling remains. Listen. No
  woman has known greater happiness than I have. My life has been sometimes
  almost too perfect, and yet I never altogether forgot those passionate words
  of Leonardo's. They lay like a shadow across my life, darkening and growing
  broader as the years of his confinement passed away. The time of his release
  came at last&mdash;only a few months ago, and only a few months ago, Lumley,
  I saw him."</p>

  <p>"You saw him! Where?"</p>

  <p>"In London, Lumley! Why did he come, almost on the day of his release,
  here to England? It was a country which he hated in his younger days, and
  yet, instead of visiting his old home, his love for which was almost a
  passion, instead of lingering in those sunny southern towns where many
  friends still remained who would have received him with open arms, he came
  straight to London alone. I found him at a hotel there, broken down, and
  almost, as it were, on the threshold of death! Yet, when he saw me, when he
  heard my voice, the old passion blazed out. Lumley, I prayed to him for
  forgiveness, and he scorned me. He had never forgotten! He would never
  forgive! He pointed to his person, his white hairs, to all the terrible
  evidences of his long imprisonment, and once more, with the same passion
  which had trembled in his tone twenty-five years ago, he cursed me! It was
  horrible! I fled from that place like a haunted woman, and since then,
  Lumley, I have been haunted. Every feature in the girl's magnificent face,
  and every movement of her figure, reminds me that she is a Marioni!"</p>

  <p>She had risen and was standing by his side, a beautiful, but a suffering
  woman. He took her into his arms and kissed her forehead.</p>

  <p>"Mother, you have too much imagination," he said gently. "Look at the
  matter seriously. Granted that this old man still harbors a senseless
  resentment against you. Yet what could he do? He forgets the days in which he
  lives, and the country to which you belong! Vendettas and romantic
  vengeances, such as he may have dreamt of five-and-twenty years ago, are
  extinct even in his own land; here, they cannot be taken seriously at
  all!"</p>

  <p>She shivered a little, and looked into his face as though comforted in
  some measure.</p>

  <p>"That is what I say to myself, Lumley," she said; "but there are times
  when the old dread is too strong for me wholly to crush it. I am not an
  Englishwoman, you know; I come of a more superstitious race!"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry that Miss Briscoe should be the means of bringing these
  unpleasant thoughts to you," he remarked thoughtfully. "Mother!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Lumley."</p>

  <p>"Would it be a great trouble to you if&mdash;some day&mdash;I asked you to
  receive her as a daughter?"</p>

  <p>She stood quite still and shivered. Her face was suddenly of a marble
  pallor.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you mean this, Lumley?"</p>

  <p>"I mean that I care for her, mother."</p>

  <p>"You have not&mdash;spoken to her?"</p>

  <p>"No. I should not have said anything to you yet, only it pained me to
  think that there was anything between you&mdash;any aversion, I mean. I
  thought that if you knew, you would try and overcome it."</p>

  <p>"I cannot!"</p>

  <p>"Mother!"</p>

  <p>"Lumley, I cannot! She looks at me out of his eyes; she speaks to me with
  his voice; something tells me that she bears in her heart his hate toward me.
  You do not know these Marionis! They are one in hate and one in love;
  unchanging and hard as the rocks on which their castle frowns. Even
  Margharita herself, in the old days, never forgave me for sending Leonardo to
  prison, although I saved her lover's life as well as mine. Lumley, you have
  said nothing to her?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet."</p>

  <p>"She would not marry you! I tell you that in her heart she hates us all!
  Sometimes I fancy that she is here&mdash;only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mother!"</p>

  <p>He laid his hand firmly upon her white trembling arm. She looked around,
  following his eyes. Margharita, pale and proud, was standing upon the
  threshold, with a great bunch of white hyacinths in the bosom of her black
  dress.</p>

  <p>"Am I intruding?" she asked quietly. "I will come down some other
  evening."</p>

  <p>Lord Lumley sprang forward to stop her; but his mother was the first to
  recover herself.</p>

  <p>"Pray don't go away, Margharita," she said, with perfect self-possession.
  "Only a few minutes ago we were complaining that you came down so seldom.
  Lumley, open the piano, and get Miss Briscoe's songs."</p>

  <p>He was by her side in a moment, but he found time for an admiring glance
  toward his mother. She had taken up a paper knife, and was cutting the pages
  of her book. It was the <i>savoir-faire</i> of a great lady.</p>

     id="chXXIII"></a>XXIII.&mdash;MARGHARITA'S DIARY&mdash;A
     CORRESPONDENCE</h2>

  <p class="first">Letter from Count Leonardo di Marioni to Miss M. Briscoe,
  care of the Earl of St. Maurice, Mallory Grange, Lincolnshire.</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Hotel de Paris, Turin</span>.</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My beloved Niece</span>: Alas! I have
  but another disappointment to recount. I arrived here last night, and early
  this morning I visited the address which I obtained at Florence with so much
  difficulty. The house was shut up. From inquiries made with caution among the
  neighbors I learned that Andrea Paschuli had left a few months before for
  Rome. Thither I go in search of him.</p>

  <p class="letter">The delay is irksome, but it is necessary. Although my
  desire for the day of my vengeance to come is as strong as ever, I would not
  have the shadow of a suspicion rest upon you. Truly, yours will be no crime,
  but the world and the courts of justice would have it otherwise. You will, in
  verity, be but the instrument. Upon my head be the guilt, as mine will be the
  exceeding joy, when the thing for which I crave is accomplished. Bless you,
  my child, that you have elected to aid me in carrying out this most just
  requital! Bless you, my child, that you have chosen to bring peace into the
  heart of one who has known great suffering!</p>

  <p class="letter">Your last letter was short; yet I do not wonder at it. What
  is there you can find to say to me, while our great purpose remains thus in
  abeyance? My health continues good, I am thankful to say, yet, were it
  otherwise, I know that my strength would linger with me till my oath is
  accomplished. Till that day shall come death itself has no power over me.
  Even though its shadow lay across my path I could still defy it. Think not
  that I am blaspheming, Margharita, or that I believe in no God. I believe in
  a God of justice, and he will award me my right. Oh, that the time may be
  short, for I am growing weary. Life is very burdensome, save only for its
  end.</p>

  <p class="letter">Sometimes, my beloved Margharita, you have sought to
  lighten the deep gloom through which I struggle, by picturing the happy days
  we may yet spend together in some far-distant country, where the shadows of
  this great selfish world barely reach, and its mighty roar and tumult sound
  but as a faint, low murmur. I have listened, but I have answered not; for in
  my heart I know that it will never be. Those days will never come. I have
  shrunk from throwing a chill upon your warm, generous heart; but of late I
  have wondered whether I do well in thus silently deceiving you. For,
  Margharita, there is no such time of peaceful happiness in store for me. I am
  dying! Nay, do not start! Do not pity me! Do not fear! I know it so well; and
  I feel no pang, no sorrow. The limit of my days is fixed&mdash;not in actual
  days or weeks, but by events. I shall live to see my desire accomplished, and
  then I shall die. The light may flicker, but, till then, it will not go out.
  You will ask me: Who am I that I dare to fix a limit to an existence which
  God alone controls? I cannot tell you, Margharita, why I know, or how, yet it
  is surely so. The day which sees me free of my vow will also be the day of my
  death.</p>

  <p class="letter">Trouble not, my child, at this thought, nor wonder why I
  can write of the end of my days so calmly. Ask yourself rather what further
  life could mean for me. There is no joy which I desire; my worn-out frame
  could find no pleasure in dragging out a tasteless and profitless existence.
  I look for death as one looks for his couch who has toiled and labored
  through the heat of the day. I shall find there rest and peace. I have no
  other desire.</p>

  <p class="letter">For yourself, Margharita, have no fear. I have made your
  fortune my care, and God grant that it may be a happy one. Honest men have
  made good profit out of my lands during my imprisonment. I have wealth to
  leave, and it is yours. The Castle of the Marionis will be yours, and well I
  know you will raise once more and uphold the mighty, though fallen,
  traditions of our race. I leave all fearlessly in your hands, at your entire
  disposal. Only one thing I beg of you, and that without fear of refusal.
  Marry not an Englishman. Marry one of the nobility of our own island, if you
  can find one worthy of you; if not, there are nobles of Italy with whom your
  alliance would be an honor, and also a profit. You will be rich as you are
  beautiful; and the first lady in Italy, our distant kinswoman, Angela di
  Carlotti, will be your guardian and your friend. May you be very, very happy,
  dearest; and all that comes to you you will deserve, for you have lightened
  the heart of a weary old man, whose blessing is yours, now and for ever.</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Leonardo di Marioni.</span>"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Letter from Margharita Briscoe to the Count Leonardo di
  Marioni, care of the Princess di Carlotti, Palazzo Carlotti, Rome.</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My dear, dear Uncle</span>: I am
  inclined to scold you for your letter, for it made me very sad. Why should
  you be so sure of dying just as the vengeance which is your due becomes
  yours? You are not very old, and I can nurse you even as I did before. Think
  how lonely I should be without you. No, you must not think of leaving me. I
  forbid it! It is morbid. Banish that fancy for my sake, and try and think of
  a quiet happy life together, away in some southern city, where the sea and
  the sky are blue, and the sun is warm, and the breezes are soft and laden
  with the perfume of sweet flowers. We would never live in this country, would
  we? I do not like it. It is cold and damp, and it chills me, chills even my
  heart. Oh! I know just the life we could live together, and be very, very
  happy. Write to me no more of death.</p>

  <p class="letter">I am quite settled down here, waiting. My duties are light,
  and I do not find them irksome. Every day I realize that I did well in coming
  here as a governess, and not as one seeking a home. They think that it is
  because of my pride that I have willed it so. They do not know.</p>

  <p class="letter">Lady St Maurice tries to be kind to me in her way; but when
  the honeyed words are upon her lips, I think of you and my heart is steel.
  She must have been a very beautiful woman&mdash;nay, she is beautiful now!
  You asked me in your first letter to watch well and to tell you whether they
  were happy together. You asked me, and I tell you the truth.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yes! I think that of all the women whom I have ever seen,
  her life seems to have flown along the most calmly and peacefully. I have
  never seen a cloud upon her brow; I hate her for it. She has no right to be
  happy; she who by such treachery condemned you to a living death. Once my
  anger rose up so fiercely that I nearly struck her, and I had to hurry from
  the room lest I should betray myself before the time. Truly she deserves
  punishment, and my hand shall not shrink from inflicting it.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yet, after all, is death the most complete form of
  punishment. Sometimes I doubt it. I would mar the beauty of her face for
  ever, and laugh. I would strike her blind gladly; I would make her a cripple
  for life, without remorse, without hesitation. To see her suffer would please
  me. I should have no pity!</p>

  <p class="letter">But death, uncle! If anything of our religion be true,
  would death be so terrible a thing? Against my will I see that her life is
  good. She has made her home what it should be, and her husband happy. She is
  a devoted Christian, and, wet or fine, every Sunday morning before breakfast,
  she goes to the little church in the village and kneels before the altar. She
  visits the sick and the poor, and they love her. For me, religion has become
  something of a dream. I was brought up a Roman Catholic. What I am now I do
  not know! When I vowed my life to its present purpose I filled it with new
  thoughts; I put my religion away from me. I could not kneel with hate in my
  heart; I could not confess, with the desire to kill in my bosom.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yet let that pass. Supposing there be a heaven, if we kill
  her for her treachery to you will not that sin be wiped out? May she not gain
  heaven? And if so, what of our vengeance? Death is swift! What will she
  suffer? It will be those who are left behind who will feel the pain; for her,
  there will be a happiness beyond even the happiness of earth. She will be
  shriven of her sin by our vengeance.</p>

  <p class="letter">Think of this, my dear uncle! Do not imagine that I am
  growing faint-hearted; do not imagine that I am drawing back from the task
  which I now claim as my right. Death, or some other sort of punishment, shall
  surely fall upon her; she shall not escape! Only think what is best.</p>

  <p class="letter">Write to me all that is in your heart. Fear not to speak
  out! I would know all. Farewell! Your loving</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Margharita.</span>"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Letter from the Count Leonardo di Marioni, the Palazzo
  Carlotti, Rome, to Miss Margharita Briscoe, Mallory Grange, Lincolnshire.</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Beloved Margharita</span>: I will
  confess that your letter troubles me. If there be heaven for the woman who
  wrecked my life, there is no heaven for me, no religion, no God. You say that
  she is a good woman. She is then a good woman through fear. She seeks to
  atone, but she can never atone. She won a boy's passionate love; she wore his
  heart upon her sleeve; she cast it away at the moment of her pleasure. She
  broke the vows of an order, which should have been as sacred to her as the
  face of God to the angels; and she sent a Marioni to rot through a useless
  life in a miserable prison. The boy whose heart she broke, and the man whose
  life she severed, lives only to nurse his unchanging and unchangeable hate
  for her. Away with all other thoughts, my vengeance knows but one end, and
  that is death! Not sudden death, mind! but death&mdash;slow, lingering, and
  painful. I would see the struggle against some mysterious sickness, with my
  own eyes; I would stand by the bedside and mock, I would watch the cheeks
  grow thin and pale, and the eyes grow dim. She should know me in those last
  moments. She should see me, the wasted shadow of a man, myself on the
  threshold of the grave, standing by her bedside, cold and unpitying, and
  holding out toward her a white hyacinth.</p>

  <p class="letter">That is how I would have it, though thus it may not be. Yet
  speak to me not of any other vengeance save death. Let none other dwell for a
  moment in your thoughts, I solemnly charge you, Margharita.</p>

  <p class="letter">As to my search, it has not yet, alas, been successful.
  Think not that I have lost heart, or that I am discouraged. Never fear but
  that I shall find the man whom I seek&mdash;if not, there are others. I give
  myself one month longer; at the end of that time, if Paschuli be not found,
  another must serve my purpose.</p>

  <p class="letter">The Princess is much interested in you, and sends her love.
  She is impatient to take you under her care. I have told her that it will not
  be long&mdash;nor will it.</p>

  <p class="letter">Farewell, my child. Soon I shall send you the good
  news.&mdash;Yours,</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Leonardo di Marioni.</span>"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chXXIV"
     id="chXXIV"></a>XXIV.&mdash;"WHITE HYACINTHS"</h2>

  <p class="first">I am driven to what is either the vehicle for the
  sentimental vaporings of a school girl, or the last resource of a desperate,
  friendless woman. I am going to set down on blank paper the record of events
  here just in the way they occur to me. I am going to enjoy the luxury of
  being honest to myself. I need not say in which of the above states I am.
  That is soon shown.</p>

  <p>I would to God that I had died before I had come here; before I had sought
  out my uncle, Count Marioni, and listened to the pitiful story of his wrongs.
  I am pledged to a purpose so awful that I dare not think of it. Day by day I
  am expecting the time to arrive for the accomplishment of my hideous vow. God
  keep it back! Keep me innocent a little longer!</p>

  <p>I write this in a weak moment. There are times when my uncle's wistful
  eyes seem turned upon me, full of mute pleading, and the old spirit of my
  race stirs up a great passion of hate in my heart. Then the thing seems easy;
  I long for a weapon that I may end the struggle, and avenge the man who looks
  to me to strike. Her gentle manners and kind words have no influence. I am
  adamant. I look across the sea, and I see the figure of a man, pale and
  lonely, languishing year by year in a Roman prison. Then, indeed, my heart is
  hard and my hand is ready!</p>

  <p>But there are other times, such as these, when I loathe myself and the
  part I am playing; when an unutterable horror comes upon me, and I see myself
  and my purpose in hideous, ghastly colors. It is such a mood that has driven
  me to make use of this dumb confidant, that I may confess what this thing is
  which has dawned upon me. My cheeks are stained with shame as I write it.
  Never could it have passed my lips. Oh! my love, my love, cursed am I that I
  love you!</p>

  <p>He shall never know it! He thinks me cold and capricious! Let him! It is
  my purpose to make him suffer, and he shall suffer! In that I will be true to
  my oath; I will make of this weakness a scourge! No one will know what it
  costs me! No one will know how sweet to me are the words which I train my
  lips to answer with scorn! Never a tender look or word shall he gain from me;
  yet this much can I promise myself. No one else shall ever be dear to me! No
  other lover will I have save his memory! He thinks that I dislike him! He
  shall think so to the end! He shall never know&mdash;never!</p>

  <p>I took up a novel this morning, and tried to read, but could not. Ah!
  those fools who write about a woman's love&mdash;what do they know about it?
  Nothing! less than nothing! I, Margharita, am nineteen years old, and I love!
  I would die this moment cheerfully, sooner than he should know it! Yet,
  though I shall never hear one word of love from his lips, or rest for one
  moment in his arms; though I live to be an old woman, I would starve, beg,
  die, sooner than give myself to any other man. To have loved, even though the
  love be unknown, and to have been loved, even though it be silently, is sweet
  to a woman. She can crystallize the memory in her heart and pass through life
  sad, perhaps, yet content, cold and deaf to all other voices. They say that a
  man is not like this. Perhaps! A woman's nature is finer than a
  man's&mdash;less passionate, but more devoted.</p>

  <p>To-night, as the dressing bell rang, and I was coming upstairs to change
  my gown for dinner, he met me in the hall and offered me&mdash;a spray of
  white hyacinths! How my fingers shook as I took them! White hyacinths! If he
  had only known what he had been doing. White hyacinths! What was that
  oath&mdash;"Vengeance upon traitors." Does she remember it, I wonder? I think
  that she does, for I wore them in the bosom of my dress, and she turned pale
  when she glanced at them. She looked at me as though she were afraid. Does my
  face remind her of the past, I wonder? She told me that my features are the
  features of the Marionis, and I know that I am like my mother! I am glad of
  it! I would have my face bring a pang to her heart every time she looks at
  it. That is justice!</p>

  <p>She looked, as though fascinated, at the bunch of white flowers in my
  bosom. I took care to let her know that Lord Lumley had given them to me. I
  am never so gracious to him as in her presence.</p>

  <p>"By the by, mother," he said, during a pause in the conversation, "I have
  noticed that, while you use every other color of hyacinths for table
  decorations, you never use any white ones. Why is it?"</p>

  <p>She looked at her husband. I saw their eyes meet across the table, and
  that look told me how near the past was to their thoughts.</p>

  <p>"It is a flower I do not care for, Lumley," she said quietly. "The perfume
  is too faint. Besides, they are so suggestive of funerals."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you would prefer my not wearing mine, then," I remarked
  carelessly. "I will throw them away."</p>

  <p>I saw him bite his lip and frown, and I laughed to myself. Lady St.
  Maurice was hesitating.</p>

  <p>"I should be sorry for you to do that," she said. "Groves can take them
  away until after dinner, if you would not mind."</p>

  <p>"They are scarcely worth keeping," I went on, drawing them from my
  corsage. "I care nothing for them after all," and opening the window just
  behind my chair, I threw them into the darkness.</p>

  <p>Lord Lumley came to me in the drawing room afterward.</p>

  <p>"It was scarcely kind of you to throw my flowers away," he said, bending
  over my chair.</p>

  <p>I turned back with my hands clasped behind my head and laughed up at
  him.</p>

  <p>"Why not? They were nothing to me. It was kind to your mother at any
  rate."</p>

  <p>Oh! hypocrite! hypocrite! If he could only have seen me a few minutes
  before, stealing along in the shadow of the shrubs outside looking about in
  the darkness till I had found them, and holding them passionately to my lips.
  They were in my pocket then, wrapped in a lace handkerchief. They are in a
  secret drawer of my desk now, and there will they remain forever. I do not
  mind confessing that they are very precious to me. But he does not know
  that.</p>

  <p>He turned away offended and left me. But I went to the piano and sang a
  wild Neapolitan love song, and when I had finished he was leaning over me
  with a deep glow in his pale cheeks and his eyes fixed upon mine. Does he
  know how handsome he is, I wonder? Whence did I get the strength to look into
  those deep blue eyes, burning with passion, and mock at him?</p>

  <p>"You sing divinely of what you know nothing!" he said.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that rather a rash assumption?" I answered lightly. "You are paying
  me a poor compliment in taking it for granted that I never had a lover, Lord
  Lumley."</p>

  <p>"Have you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, heaps!"</p>

  <p>"Are you engaged, then?" he asked fiercely.</p>

  <p>"How like a man you jump at conclusions!"</p>

  <p>"But, are you?"</p>

  <p>"Is it your business, Lord Lumley?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"Then if you make everybody's love affairs your concern, you must find
  plenty to interest you."</p>

  <p>"There is only one person in the world in whose love affairs I am
  interested."</p>

  <p>"Naturally!" I answered. "Whose else should be so interesting as your
  own?"</p>

  <p>"I did not mean that!" he exclaimed, almost angrily. "You are bandying
  words with me."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, it is you who seem bent on mystifying me," I answered,
  laughing.</p>

  <p>"You shall hear me speak more plainly then."</p>

  <p>"I would rather not. Enigmas are so much more interesting. Will you allow
  me to pass?"</p>

  <p>"Why," he asked, without moving an inch.</p>

  <p>"Because, as your mother does not seem to be coming in again, I should
  prefer going to my room."</p>

  <p>"She is coming in again. I heard her order coffee here in ten
  minutes."</p>

  <p>"I don't want any coffee, and I won't be kept here. Lord Lumley, be so
  good as to allow me to pass."</p>

  <p>"In one minute, Margharita. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lord Lumley, I allow no man to call me by my Christian name without
  permission."</p>

  <p>"Then give me permission."</p>

  <p>"Never!"</p>

  <p>"You don't mean that?"</p>

  <p>"I do! Lord Lumley, allow me to pass. I will not be kept here against my
  will!"</p>

  <p>He caught hold of my wrist, but I snatched my hand away.</p>

  <p>"Margharita, listen! I love you. Why should you be angry? I want you to be
  my wife."</p>

  <p>I believe he thought that I was won. I had sunk down upon the music stool
  and covered my face with my hands. My bosom was heaving with sobs. With all
  my strength I was battling with a strange bewildering succession of feelings.
  In reality I was more exquisitely and perfectly happy than I had ever dreamed
  of.</p>

  <p>I felt his strong hands close over my fingers and remove them one by one.
  His head was quite close to mine, and suddenly I felt his mustache brush my
  cheek.</p>

  <p>I sprang to my feet, wildly, fiercely angry. My eyes were flashing, and I
  had drawn myself up until I seemed almost as tall as he was. If he had dared
  to kiss me. Oh! if he had dared!</p>

  <p>"Let me pass!" I cried passionately. "Let me pass at once, I say."</p>

  <p>He fell back immediately. He was half frightened, half puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Lord Lumley, I never wish you to speak to me again," I cried, trembling
  all over with passionate indignation, and dashing the tears from my eyes. "I
  hate you. Do you hear! I hate you!"</p>

  <p>He ought to have been abashed, but he was not.</p>

  <p>"You have no cause to hate me!" he said proudly. "Surely a man does not
  insult a woman by offering her his love, as I have offered you mine. I
  scarcely see at least how I have deserved your anger."</p>

  <p>Suddenly his voice broke down, and he went on in a very altered tone:</p>

  <p>"Oh, Margharita, my love, my love! Give me one word of hope! Tell me at
  least that you are not really angry with me."</p>

  <p>And then, without a moment's warning, the fire of indignation which had
  leaped up to help me suddenly died out. He was standing respectfully away
  from me, pale and dignified. His face was full of emotion, and his hands were
  trembling; but some instinct seemed to have told him how I hated his touch,
  and he did not attempt even to hold my hand. Oh! that moment, terrible as it
  was at the time, will be very sweet to think upon in after days.</p>

  <p>My strength had come to an end. I knew that I was in terrible risk of
  undoing all that I had done, but I could not help it. That moment seemed
  somehow sacred. Although my whole life was itself a lie, I could not then
  have looked in his eyes and spoken falsely. If I had let him see my face,
  though only for an instant, he would have known my secret; so I buried it in
  my hands, and swept from the room before he could stop me.</p>

  <p>Am I more happy or more miserable, I wonder, since he has spoken those
  words which seem to be ever ringing in my ears? Both, I think! Life is more
  intense; it has other depths now besides that well of hate and pity which has
  brought me into this household. At any rate, I have felt emotions to-night
  which I never dreamed of before.</p>

  <p>If only he knew&mdash;knew all, how he would scorn, hate, despise me! How
  he would hasten to drive me out of his memory, to crush every tender thought
  of me, to purge his heart of love for me, to pluck it up by the roots and
  cast it away forever! Would he find it an easy task, I wonder? Perhaps. He
  loves his mother so much. Why should he not? So far as he is concerned, she
  deserves it. She is a good mother, and a good wife. If it were not for the
  past I would call her a good woman. Sometimes I wish that she were not so,
  that she was still vain and heartless, the same woman who, for the sake of an
  alien and a stranger, brought down a living death upon the man who had
  trusted her with his most sacred secrets; and that man the last of the
  Marionis, my uncle. I think of it, and coldness steals once more into my
  heart. What she is now is of no account. It is the past for which she must
  suffer.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chXXV"
     id="chXXV"></a>XXV.&mdash;AMONG THE PINE TREES</h2>

  <p class="first">This morning I heard noises about the house quite early and
  heavy footsteps in the drive. I was awake&mdash;it was only a few minutes
  since I had been sitting at the window watching the day break over the sea,
  and I had the curiosity to look out. I think that something must have told me
  what it meant, for my heart sank even before I had any idea of what was going
  on. There were two sailors from Lord Lumley's yacht in the bay, carrying
  great hampers down from the house. I guessed it all in a moment; he was going
  away.</p>

  <p>I put on my dressing-gown and sat down in a low chair to watch. Through a
  chink in the blind I could keep it lowered and still see quite plainly.
  Presently I saw him appear in his yachting clothes, with oilskins on his arm.
  Would he glance up at all, I wondered. Yes; at the bend in the shrubbery he
  turned and looked for a full minute up at my window. It was all I could do to
  keep from waving him to come back. How pale he was, and how dejected his walk
  seemed. My eyes grew dim, and there was a lump in my throat as he turned and
  walked away. Would it have made any difference, I wonder, if he had known of
  my being there; if he could have seen my poor, sad, tear-stained face? I
  think that it would.</p>

  <p>He has gone. I have seen the last of him. Am I glad or sorry, I wonder.
  Glad that my task has become so much easier, or sorry for my own unreasoning,
  selfish sake. Why should I be a hypocrite? These pages are to be the mirror
  of my heart. To others my whole life is a lie. I write here so that I may
  retain some faint knowledge of what truth really is. I am
  sorry&mdash;desperately, foolishly sorry. I know that my cheeks are leaden,
  and my heart is heavy. There is no light in the day; none of that swift, keen
  struggling with myself which his presence always imposed. He is gone, and I
  miss them; I should have laughed a few short days ago to have believed this
  true. But it is true!</p>

  <p>The first bell has gone, and I have drawn up my blind. The promise of that
  blood-red sunrise has been fulfilled. I wish that he had waited another day.
  I have an idea that there is going to be a storm. There is a pale yellow
  light in the sky which I do not like, and, as far as one can see, the waves
  are crested with white foam. It is an ugly sea and an ugly sky. I wish that I
  were going with him, and that a storm might come and we might die together. I
  would not mind his holding me in his arms then. We would die like that, and
  death would be joy.</p>

  <p>At breakfast I was able to take the news of his departure without making
  any sign. I fancy that Lady St. Maurice was watching me when she made the
  announcement. If she was expecting to read my thoughts and fears she was
  disappointed. She could have seen nothing but the most utter indifference. I
  felt that my mask was perfect.</p>

  <p>But as the day wore on my task grew harder. The wind, which had been
  blowing hard all the morning, became a hurricane, and even in the house, with
  closed doors and windows, we could hear the far-off thunder of the sea
  sweeping in against the cliffs. Every one in the household became strangely
  restless and anxious. Lord St. Maurice, with a field glass under his arm,
  went out upon the cliffs, and he returned hatless and with his coat ripped
  up, shaking his head with ill-affected cheerfulness. There was no sign of the
  <i>Stormy Petrel</i>.</p>

  <p>"Lumley would make for Yarmouth harbor directly he saw this beast of a
  gale blowing up," he declared, walking up and down the morning room with
  troubled face. "He is a little careless, but he is an excellent sailor, and
  he must have seen that there was dirty weather brewing. It isn't as though it
  were a sudden squall, you know, or anything of that sort. There was plenty of
  warning. All the same, I wish he hadn't started. It was very foolish, and I
  don't like such whims. I didn't hear him say anything about a cruise
  yesterday. Did you, Adrienne?"</p>

  <p>Was it my fancy, or did Lady St. Maurice indeed glance at me as she
  answered:</p>

  <p>"No, I heard nothing. Late last night he came to my room and told me that
  he had given Groves some orders, and that he should leave quite early this
  morning."</p>

  <p>Lord St. Maurice frowned.</p>

  <p>"It is most extraordinary," he said. "He gave you no reason whatever,
  then?"</p>

  <p>"None!"</p>

  <p>"Did he say where he was going to? We were shooting together all yesterday
  afternoon, and he said not a word about going away. On the contrary, he
  arranged to go to Norwich on Thursday to look at some horses."</p>

  <p>The Countess shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I know no more than you do, Geoffrey. I asked him where he was going, and
  he did not seem at all sure. He said that he would write if he remained away
  more than a day or two. You know how uncertain he is."</p>

  <p>"It is very inconsiderate of him," Lord St. Maurice declared, leaving the
  room abruptly. "I am surprised at Lumley."</p>

  <p>Lady St. Maurice and I were alone. She was pretending to read and I to
  work. So far as she was concerned, I could see that it was a pretence, for
  she held her book upside down, and for my part, I did not make a correct
  stitch. I knew that I ought to have been calm, that I was imperiling my
  secret every moment. When at last she spoke to me, I made a great effort to
  control my tone.</p>

  <p>"Lord Lumley said nothing to you, I suppose, Margharita, about going
  away?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever," I answered quietly. "He would be scarcely likely to
  mention his plans to me and not to you or Lord St. Maurice."</p>

  <p>I was forced to look up, and I met her eyes fixed upon me with a look
  which I had seen there once or twice before. It was almost a look of fear, as
  though she saw in my face something which aroused a host of sad, dimly-veiled
  memories. Was she wondering whether the presence of a Marioni in her house
  boded ill-fortune to herself and those who were dear to her? It may have been
  so.</p>

  <p>She did not answer immediately, and I took advantage of the pause to leave
  the room. I could not bear to talk to her.</p>

  <p>Ought I not to have been glad at all this&mdash;to have watched her pale,
  suffering face with satisfaction, and even with inward joy. Was she not in
  trouble greater than any I could bring upon her, and, indeed, had I not had a
  hand in it? Was it not I who had driven her son out into this danger? Should
  I not have rejoiced? Alas! alas! how could I, when my own heart was beating
  fast in a very agony of sickening fear.</p>

  <p>My little pupil was away for the day&mdash;gone to play with the
  clergyman's children down in the village, and my time was my own. I was
  thankful, for I could not possibly have forced myself into the wearisome
  routine of lesson hearing and teaching. Solitude was my only relief.</p>

  <p>The day wore on. Servants had been sent to every point along the coast,
  and the harbor master at Yarmouth had been telegraphed to every hour. I stood
  by my window, looking out in the fast gathering twilight, until I could bear
  it no longer. Dashing the tears from my face, I caught up a thick cloak, and
  running softly down the back stairs, left the house unobserved.</p>

  <p>At first I could scarcely stand, and, indeed, as I turned the corner of
  the avenue and faced the sea, a gust of wind carried me off from my feet, and
  I had to cling to the low iron railings for support. The thunder of the storm
  and the waves seemed to shake the air around me. The sky was dark and riven
  with faint flashes of stormlight, which slanted down to the sea. By hard
  struggling I managed to make my way on to the cliffs, and stood there,
  looking downward, with my arm passed round a tall fir sapling for support.
  What a night it was! The spray of the waves breaking against the cliff leaped
  up into my face mingled with the blinding rain, and dimmed my vision so that
  I could only catch a faint view of the boiling, seething gulf below. Beyond,
  all was chaos; for a gray haze floated upon the water and met the low hanging
  clouds. And clear above the deep thunder of the sea came the shrill yelling
  of the wind in the pine groves which fringed the cliffs, sounding like the
  demoniacal laughter of an army of devils. Shall I ever forget the horror of
  that day, I wonder! I think not! It is written upon a page of my memory in
  characters over which time can have no power.</p>

  <p>And in that moment of agony, when my thoughts were full of his peril, I
  wrestled no longer with my secret; I knew that I loved him. I knew that he
  was dear to me as no other man could be. I knew that I was face to face with
  a misery unchanging and unending.</p>

  <p>Were not the fates themselves fighting against me in my task? That it
  should be, of all men upon this earth, he, the son of the woman whose death
  would be at my door. A murderess! Should I be that! The wind caught up the
  word which had burst from my pale lips, and I seemed to hear it echoed with
  fiendish mirth among the bending tree tops of the plantation. A murderess!
  and of his mother, the mother whom he loved so fondly! If he should know it!
  If the day should come when my sin should be laid bare, and he should know
  that he had given his love to such a one. Sin! Was it a sin? Was my love
  turning the whole world upside down? Had it seemed so to me before? Was it
  sin or justice! Oh! to whom should I look for strength to hold me to my
  purpose. To pray would be blasphemous. For me there was no God, no friend on
  earth, no heaven! I could only think of that one shattered life, and hug it
  to my memory.</p>

  <p>I wandered backward and forward in the storm, drenched and cold, yet all
  unmindful of my state. I could have borne no roof over my head in those hours
  of my agony. The thought of his danger maddened me. Even though I knew so
  well that he could be nothing to me; that if he knew the truth, he would
  loathe me; that soon the day would come when I should scarcely dare to raise
  my eyes to his before we parted forever. All these things seemed to make me
  long the more passionately to look once more into his face, to know that he
  was safe. It was my fault that he was in this danger. Horrible thought!</p>

  <p>I was exhausted; worn out in body and mind by the sickening fears which no
  effort of will seemed able to quell. Even my limbs at last gave way beneath
  me, and I sank upon my knees, holding my face in my hands. Had the edge of
  the cliff been a little nearer, could I have done it without any physical
  effort, I had been content to close my eyes, and throw myself into the sea.
  If there are no joys in death, at least there is rest.</p>

  <p>Then a voice came to me.</p>

  <p>"Margharita!"</p>

  <p>I leaped up from the wet ground with wildly-beating heart. Was it some
  mocking trick of the storm&mdash;that voice in my ears, that dear, dear
  voice? My eyes seemed dilated, and through the deep gloom I saw a tall figure
  striding toward me. Then I know that I cried out and called to him by his
  name; and alas! by the tone of my voice, and the light that flashed into my
  face, my secret was gone! For evil or for good he knew then that I loved
  him!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chXXVI"
     id="chXXVI"></a>XXVI.&mdash;STORMS</h2>

  <p class="first">There came a time then of blessed and grateful
  unconsciousness. The tumult of the storm was reduced to a mere singing in my
  ears, and darkness seemed to have closed in around me. When I opened my eyes,
  I was resting in his arms, and a delicious sense of happiness was stealing
  through me. Sensation had overpowered memory, and I was happy. Ah! if life
  could have ended then&mdash;that was how I felt. If only the future and that
  shrunken relentless figure pointing me on to tragedy&mdash;if only they could
  have melted away! Alas! alas!</p>

  <p>He had become bold at my mute self-yielding, and at something which he
  must have seen in my face. I felt him bending down over me, and suddenly my
  lips partly opened to frame the feeblest of protests were closed in a long
  passionate kiss, and his arms drew me toward him. Still I made no effort to
  release myself. A desperate self-abandonment had crept in upon me. The
  happiness of that moment should recompense me for the misery to come. Time
  took to itself wings then; I had no power or will to measure it. If hell
  itself had been yawning at my feet, I was content.</p>

  <p>It was he who spoke at last, still clasping my hands, and looking eagerly
  into my face.</p>

  <p>"Margharita, my love, I have come back to you. How shall I bless this
  storm!"</p>

  <p>"Have you been in danger?" I asked softly.</p>

  <p>"Nothing to speak of," he laughed. "We ran for Yarmouth harbor directly we
  saw what was coming, and only lost a few spars. What a sea it was, though.
  Wave after wave broke over our bows and swept the deck. It was a miracle we
  lost no men."</p>

  <p>"And how is it that you are home so quickly?"</p>

  <p>"I took the first train from Yarmouth, and wired for a special from the
  junction. I knew that my mother would be anxious, and they told me that there
  was very little chance of telegrams being delivered safely; so much damage
  had been done to the wires."</p>

  <p>"You thought of no one but your mother?" I whispered, a little
  reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"My darling! how was I to know that any one else cared?"</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>The sense of relief in my heart was over-powering, I seemed to have no
  desire for speech. The sound of his voice was like music to me, and I
  preferred to listen.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me that I have had no thought save of you, Margharita," he
  went on slowly. "In all that storm, when flying clouds and spray and driving
  rain shut us in on every side, I thought of nothing else save of you. No one
  knows the boat so well as I, and for the last four hours I was lashed to a
  board, steering. Margharita, all that time, and all the time I stood on the
  bridge, I seemed to see you always. Sometimes it was the mist of rain and
  spray which opened to let you through; and sometimes&mdash;sometimes I almost
  fancied that you were by my side. Think of you, Margharita! Why, I was a
  haunted man. In all that thunder of sea and wind, when I had to use a
  speaking trumpet to make my men hear me a few yards away, I could only hear
  your voice in my ears as distinctly as you hear me now. They say that when
  one is in danger, or near death, that the imagination is quickened. It must
  have been so with me, for your presence and the sound of your voice were very
  real to me."</p>

  <p>"How did you find me here?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, as soon as I could decently get away from my people, I asked for
  you. They sent to your room, and could not find you. Then one of the servants
  thought that she had seen you leave the house and come this way. So I started
  off in search."</p>

  <p>"It was foolish of me to come out. I could not rest indoors."</p>

  <p>"Why?" eagerly.</p>

  <p>"The storm was so dreadful."</p>

  <p>"And so you came out into it. A bad reason. Was there no other?"</p>

  <p>"I was anxious, too, I think. I wanted to see what the sea looked
  like."</p>

  <p>"Why were you anxious; what about?"</p>

  <p>"Somebody was in danger."</p>

  <p>"My darling!"</p>

  <p>His lips met mine again. My strength seemed altogether gone. I made no
  effort to escape.</p>

  <p>"I didn't say who 'somebody' was," I protested weakly.</p>

  <p>He laughed gaily.</p>

  <p>"But I know."</p>

  <p>"Sure?"</p>

  <p>"Quite sure."</p>

  <p>"I may have relatives who are sailors."</p>

  <p>"You may have, but you haven't."</p>

  <p>I considered for a moment.</p>

  <p>"It was purely a matter of responsibility, you know. I felt that I had
  something to do with your going away. I was disagreeable last night, and you
  were offended. See?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit."</p>

  <p>"You are very stupid."</p>

  <p>"I am not now; I was last night."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I will answer you by asking a question. Will you promise to reply to
  it?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Cela d&eacute;pend.</i> I won't be rash."</p>

  <p>"Do you care for me&mdash;just a little?" he asked, tenderly but
  hopefully.</p>

  <p>Oh, horrible! A vision seemed to float suddenly before my eyes. The
  darkness faded away, to be replaced by a little whitewashed chamber in a
  distant land. I saw an old man dying, with his eyes fixed upon me full of
  mute reproach, his trembling fingers pointed at me with scorn, and his lips
  framing a feeble curse. Suddenly his look changed, his arm fell, his face
  grew suddenly bright and joyful, and the curse changed into a fervent
  blessing. Then the room widened, and the little figure under that spotless
  coverlet faded away. It was a chamber in a palace, and I saw Lady St.
  Maurice, also on her death-bed. Her husband and her son knelt by her side
  with bared heads, and the air was laden and heavy with the sound of their
  sobs. She alone did not weep, and her pale, spiritualized face glowed like
  the face of a martyred saint. And as I watched I seemed to hear one word
  constantly escaping from those who watched by her side, and caught up and
  echoed a thousand times by the sad wailing wind until it rang in my ears
  unceasingly&mdash;and the word was "Murderess!"</p>

  <p>It passed away&mdash;vanished in a phantom of mist, like some weird morbid
  fancy, but the joy of those last few minutes was quenched. I drew myself from
  his arms, and pressed my hand to my side. There was a sharp pain there.</p>

  <p>"We must go back to the house," I said. "I have been a little mad, I
  think, and I am very wet."</p>

  <p>He looked at me, amazed.</p>

  <p>"Won't you answer my question first?" he pleaded. "Margharita, make me
  very happy. Be my wife."</p>

  <p>His wife. Oh, the grim grotesque agony of it all. My strength would never
  be sufficient to carry me through all this. My heart was faint, and my speech
  was low; yet it was as cold and resolute as I could make it.</p>

  <p>"Never! never! I would sooner die than that. Let us go back at
  once&mdash;at once!"</p>

  <p>He caught me by the wrist, and forced me to look into his face. It was
  unwise of him to touch me against my will, for the fire flashed into my eyes,
  and my anger gave me strength.</p>

  <p>"Margharita, what does this mean? You do care for a me a little, don't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>I lied, God knows, and all in vain.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not so very much now," he said, with a little sigh, "but you will
  some day. I know that you will. Be generous, Margharita, give me a little
  hope."</p>

  <p>I laid my hand upon his arm. How could I convince him. Anger, lies,
  reasoning, all seemed so weak and ineffective; and he was so
  strong&mdash;strong in his own love, strong unconsciously in mine.</p>

  <p>"Lord Lumley, I can only give you one answer, and that is&mdash;'No.'
  Nothing can change me. I would sooner throw myself from these cliffs than
  become your wife."</p>

  <p>He considered for a moment, while I watched him anxiously.</p>

  <p>"I have a right to know your reason for that speech," he said in a low but
  firm tone. "Give me your hands for one moment, Margharita&mdash;so! Now, look
  me in the eyes, and tell me that you do not care for me!"</p>

  <p>I was a fool to try. I might have known that, after all I had passed
  through that day, it was beyond my strength. I got as far as the first three
  words, and then I burst into tears. His whole face lit up with joy at my
  failure.</p>

  <p>"I am satisfied!" he said, drawing my hand through his arm. "Come! we will
  go back to the house. I must not have you catch cold!"</p>

  <p>He spoke with an air of fond proprietorship which made my heart tremble,
  but I had no more words left with which to fight my battle. My strength was
  gone; I did not even try to withdraw my hand.</p>

  <p>We walked away, and I did my best to choke the hysterical sobs which
  threatened me. Directly we left the shelter of the pine grove, speech became
  impossible. We had to fight our way along, step by step, with the wind and
  rain beating in our faces. I was thankful for it, for the physical effort
  seemed to stimulate and calm me.</p>

  <p>When at last we reached the house and stood inside the hall, he turned to
  me and spoke for the first time.</p>

  <p>"That walk was quite an event, wasn't it? Let me feel how wet you
  are."</p>

  <p>He ran his fingers down my arm and back, and then rang the hall bell
  violently.</p>

  <p>"You are wet through," he said gravely. "And it is my fault. Instead of
  bringing you home at once, as I ought to have done, I kept you out there
  talking. Run upstairs at once, Margharita, please, and change all your
  things. I will send up hot water."</p>

  <p>He had been hurrying me to the stairs all the time, and I began slowly to
  ascend them. He stood down in the white stone hall, watching me
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>"You won't be long, will you?" he said, as I reached the corner. "I want
  to talk to you before dinner."</p>

  <p>I answered him mechanically, and turning away, went along the corridor to
  my room, and flung myself upon the bed. I had scarcely been there five
  minutes when there was a knock at the door.</p>

  <p>"Who is there?" I asked, sitting up and hastily drying my eyes.</p>

  <p>A servant's voice answered, and I recognized Cecile, the Countess's own
  maid.</p>

  <p>"Her ladyship has sent you a cup of tea, miss, and hopes you will be sure
  to change all your clothes. There is a letter for you, too, miss."</p>

  <p>I bade the girl come in and put the tea down. When she had gone, I
  stretched out my hand, and took up the letter with trembling fingers. It was
  from my uncle, and the postmark was Rome.</p>

  <h2><a name="chXXVII"
     id="chXXVII"></a>XXVII.&mdash;A LIFE IN THE BALANCE</h2>

  <p class="first">I suppose it is absurd to talk about presentiments, and yet
  I knew what was in that letter. As plainly as though I saw it written up in
  characters of fire, I knew its contents and my doom. The climax of all things
  was at hand. The time was approaching when I must keep my vow, or confess
  myself foresworn&mdash;an unworthy daughter of the Marionis. It was a bitter
  choice, for there was a life in either balance; the life of this traitress of
  five-and-twenty years ago, or of an old man sick to the heart with
  disappointment; deceived by a woman in his youth, and a woman again in his
  old age.</p>

  <p>I bathed my eyes and face, and, throwing off my wet things, wrapped myself
  in a dressing robe. Then I poured out a cup of tea and drank it over the
  fire. All the while that letter lay before me on the tray, face upward, and
  my eyes kept straying unwillingly toward it. It had a sort of fascination for
  me, and in the end it conquered. I had meant to give myself a few hours' more
  freedom&mdash;to have put it away until bedtime, but a sudden impulse came to
  me, and I yielded. I caught it up with firm fingers and tore it
  open.</p>&lt;&lt;BR&gt;

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Palazzo Carlotti, Rome</span>.</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Margharita</span>,&mdash;Beloved.
  Success! success! My search is over, my purpose is accomplished. I have found
  Paschuli. Enclosed in this letter you will find a smaller envelope. It
  contains the powder.</p>

  <p class="letter">Can you wonder that my hand is shaking, and that there is a
  mist before my eyes! I am an old man, and great joy is hard to bear; harder
  still after a weary, wretched life such as mine. You will understand,
  though&mdash;you will be able to decipher this faint, uncertain handwriting,
  and you will forgive me if it tires you. Ay, you will do that, Margharita, I
  know!</p>

  <p class="letter">Let me tell you how I found him. It was by the purest
  accident. I turned aside into an old curio shop to buy some trifle for you
  which took my fancy, and it was Paschuli himself who served me. Thus you see
  how indirectly even your star always shines over mine and leads me aright. If
  it had not been for you I should never have dreamed of entering the place,
  but I thought of you and your taste for Roman jewelry, and behold, I found
  myself in the presence of the man for whom I was making vain search. My
  Margharita! my good angel! I have you to thank even for the successful
  accomplishment of my part in that edict of our Order which you and I are
  banded together to carry out.</p>

  <p class="letter">At first, Paschuli did not recognize me, and it was long
  before I could make him believe that I was indeed that most unfortunate of
  men, Leonardo di Marioni. But when he was convinced, he promised me what I
  sought. That same evening he gave it to me.</p>

  <p class="letter">Margharita, there is no poison in the world like that which
  I send you in this letter. The merest grain of it is sufficient, in wine or
  water, or food of any sort. There is no art of medicine which could detect
  it&mdash;no means by which the death, which will surely follow, can be
  averted; so you run no risk, my child! Bide your time, and
  then&mdash;then!</p>

  <p class="letter">Margharita, I am coming to you. Nay, do not be alarmed, I
  run no risk. I shall come disguised, and no one will know me, but I must see
  something of the end with my own eyes, or half its sweetness would be
  untasted. I would see her face and die! I would trace, day by day, the
  workings of the poison; and in the last moments of her agony I would reveal
  myself, and would point to my withered frame and the hand of death upon my
  forehead, and cry out to her that the Order of the White Hyacinth had kept
  its vow. I would have her eyes meet mine as the mists of death closed in upon
  her. I would have her know that the oath of a Marioni, in friendship or in
  hate, in protection or in vengeance, is one with his honor. This may not be,
  Margharita! I cannot see all this! I cannot even stand by her bedside for a
  moment and show her my face, that she might know whose hand it is which has
  stricken her down. Yet, I must be near! Fear not but that I shall manage it
  safely! I would not bring danger or the shadow of danger upon you, my
  beloved.</p>

  <p class="letter">I leave Rome to-night, and I leave it with joy. You cannot
  imagine how inexpressibly sad it has been for me to find myself in the place
  where the greater part of my youth&mdash;my too ambitious youth was spent.
  All is changed and strange to me. There are new streets and many innovations
  which puzzle me; and although my friends are kind, twenty-five years have
  crushed our sympathies. To them I am like a sad figure from a bygone world, a
  Banquo at the feast, something to pity a little&mdash;no more. I am nothing
  to anybody beyond that. I am a wearisome old man, whose mind is a blank, and
  who only cumbers the way. Ah, well, it is not for long. The day of my desire
  is at hand, and God has given me you, Margharita, to accomplish it, and to
  close my eyes in peace. Bless you, my dear, dear child! You have sweetened
  the end of a marred and wretched life! Yours has been an angel's task, and
  you will have an angel's reward."</p>

  <p class="letter">We shall meet before long, but of the manner of our meeting
  I cannot tell you yet. Till then adieu!&mdash;Yours in hope,</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Leonardo di Marioni</span>.</p>

  <p class="letter">"P. S.&mdash;I forgot to say that the whole of the poison,
  or even half a teaspoonful, would produce sudden and abrupt death. Just a
  pinch, administered twice, perhaps, in order to be quite secure, would be
  sufficient."</p><br>

  <p>Enclosed in the letter was the oblong envelope he spoke of, which I
  carefully opened. It contained only a small quantity of pale pink powder,
  which emitted a faint pungent odor. I locked it up in my desk, and destroyed
  the letter.</p>

  <p>All my strength had returned. I felt myself free from the madness of this
  overmastering love. Another passion for the moment had taken its place. The
  vision of that old man, wandering about the streets of Rome, with a sad,
  weary heart and tottering limbs out of touch with the times, a figure for a
  half-contemptuous pity; that is the picture which I saw steadily before me to
  nerve my heart and purpose, and well it succeeded.</p>

  <p>The second bell roused me from my thoughts. I hastily rose from my chair,
  and attired myself in the plainest gown which I possessed. I unlocked my
  desk, and thrust the little packet into my pocket. Then, without jewelry or
  flowers, and with my hair plainly coiled upon my head, I went downstairs.</p>

  <p>They had commenced dinner when I arrived, and Lord Lumley glanced
  reproachfully at me as I took my seat. From the sudden silence directly I
  entered, I imagined they had been talking of me, and I made my excuses with a
  momentary nervousness. There was something unusual in the air. It seemed to
  me that Lady St. Maurice was regarding me with a new and kindly interest. She
  said nothing, as I had dreaded she would, of my long absence from the house,
  and Lord St. Maurice, with a courtesy unusual even for him, rose when I
  entered, and motioning the butler away, himself held my chair. What did it
  all mean? At another time I might have wondered more, but just then there
  were other thoughts in my mind. Should I have an opportunity to commit my
  crime that night? I feared not.</p>

  <p>I gave no one any chance for sentimental conversation during dinner time,
  for I talked more than usual, and in a lighter vein. I wanted nothing said
  which could bring back to my memory that wild scene on the cliffs, or the
  hours of agony which I had been through. All such things were of the past. I
  desired to be able to look back upon them as upon some strange
  night-dream&mdash;fair enough of itself, but gone with the first breath of
  morning. To my relief, the others, too, avoided the subject. There was
  nothing said about Lord Lumley's escape which even bordered upon the
  pathetic.</p>

  <p>Dinner, which seemed to me to last longer than usual, came to an end at
  last. I had planned to make some excuse to the Countess, and leave the
  drawing-room before Lord Lumley could follow, but, as I had half expected
  that he might, Lord Lumley accompanied us there without waiting to smoke. To
  my surprise, Lady St. Maurice, before I could frame an excuse to her for my
  own departure, left us alone. Lord Lumley held the door open for her, and it
  seemed to me that a meaning glance passed between them. It was beyond my
  understanding. I could only see that my plans were frustrated, and that I
  must prepare for another struggle.</p>

  <p>He shut the door carefully, and then came back and stood over me. I looked
  at him calmly. How could he read the agony in my heart.</p>

  <p>"I am waiting for my answer, Margharita!" he said simply.</p>

  <p>"You have had the only answer which I can ever give you, Lord Lumley! I
  answered&mdash;'No!'"</p>

  <p>Then he did a thing which sounds very absurd, but which did not indeed
  seem so. He sank on one knee and took possession of my hand. I was on a low
  chair, and his face now was on a level with mine.</p>

  <p>"Margharita, my love," he whispered, "'no' is an answer which I shall
  never take. Yesterday I went away and left you, to-day I am wiser. Nothing
  can undo those few minutes on the cliffs, dearest. You love me! Ah! you
  cannot deny it! Have I not read it in your face, and in your eyes? Take back
  your 'no,' Margharita. By the memory of those few minutes, you are mine
  forever! You have not the power or the right to deny yourself to me. You are
  mine! You belong to me!"</p>

  <p>I shrank back. I began to be frightened at his earnestness&mdash;at the
  note of triumph in his voice. How strong and masterful he was. Should I be
  able to hold out against him? Only my will and the memory of a wasted life
  against my heart and such pleading as this. It was a hard, unequal
  battle.</p>

  <p>"Margharita, I love you all the more that you are not lightly won!" he
  continued, drawing me closer to him&mdash;almost into his arms. "Listen! I
  believe that I have some idea as to the reason of your answer. You think,
  perhaps, that my people might not be willing. You are proud&mdash;too proud.
  Tell me, is this not so?"</p>

  <p>"A governess is no fitting wife for you. You should choose one from among
  the noble women of your country. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He interrupted me. If I had not drawn back quickly he would have stopped
  my lips with a kiss.</p>

  <p>"No one in this world could be as fit as you, for it is you, and you only,
  whom I love. But listen! I have spoken to my mother. I have told her."</p>

  <p>"You have told her what?" I cried.</p>

  <p>"That I love you. That I have asked you to be my wife."</p>

  <p>"What did she say?"</p>

  <p>"What a true woman and good mother should say; that if you were indeed my
  choice, then she was ready to welcome you as her daughter, and my wife."</p>

  <p>"You cannot mean it!" I cried. "She knows nothing of me, and I am
  penniless."</p>

  <p>"She knows that I love you, and that would be sufficient, dearest. But, as
  it happens, she knew more about you than I did. From her I learned, for the
  first time, that your mother came from a family which was great and noble
  before ours was ever founded. She told me a sad story of your uncle,
  Margharita, which you, too, doubtless know of, and she seemed glad to think
  that our marriage would be, in a certain sense, an act of poetic justice. She
  told me, too, Margharita, that if your uncle died unmarried, you could, if
  you chose, take his name and call yourself the Countess di Marioni. Why,
  sweetheart, I am not sure that I ought to aspire to the hand of so great a
  lady."</p>

  <p>"Your mother, the Countess of St. Maurice, told you all this? She desires
  our marriage? She knows what you are asking me?" I repeated breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Most certainly! Shall I call her? She will tell you so herself."</p>

  <p>"Do not speak to me for a moment, please."</p>

  <p>I was an idiot, but I could not help it. I buried my head in the sofa
  cushion, and sobbed. Everything seemed fighting against me, to make my
  purpose more difficult.</p>

  <p>I think that tears have a softening effect. I had steeled my heart against
  my lover, and yet he conquered. I felt his strong arms around me, and his
  lips were pressed against my wet cheeks. Oh! for strength to thrust him from
  me&mdash;to deny my love, but I could not.</p>

  <p>Why should I try to recall his words? Nay! if I could, I would not set
  them down here! I felt every fiber of my nature glowing with delight as I
  listened; every chord seemed quivering with heart-stirring music. I had given
  up all idea of resistance. A strange drowsy peace had stolen in upon me. One
  of his arms was around my waist, and my hand was imprisoned in his. So we
  sat, and the moments became golden.</p>

  <p>Interruption came at last. The door opened, and Lady St. Maurice entered.
  My lover rose at once, still holding my hand.</p>

  <p>"Mother," he said, "Margharita has made me very happy. Will you speak to
  her?"</p>

  <p>She came to us, and bent over me, her face looking very soft and sweet in
  the shaded light. In another moment she would have kissed me. I sprang to my
  feet, pale with horror.</p>

  <p>"No, no, it cannot be!" I cried. "I am not fit to be his wife&mdash;to be
  anybody's wife! Lady St. Maurice, will you not tell him so for me? Let me go
  away!"</p>

  <p>She looked surprised at my agitation, but she little guessed its cause.
  How was she to know anything of that little packet which seemed to be burning
  a hole in my heart?</p>

  <p>"No! I will not tell him that!" she said, smiling. "He loves you, and I
  believe that you are worthy of his love. That is quite sufficient. I shall be
  glad to have you for a daughter, Margharita."</p>

  <p>Lord Lumley thanked her with a look, and took her hand. They stood
  together on the hearthrug, and I was on the other side facing the window.
  Suddenly my heart gave a great leap, and the color died out of my face.
  Pressed against the dark pane I could see a pale, white face watching us. It
  was the face of my uncle, Count di Marioni.</p>

  <p>I stood swaying backward and forward for a moment, sick and dizzy with the
  horror of it. My eyes grew dim, and a mist seemed to fill the room. Then I
  felt myself sink back into my lover's arms, and memory became a blank. I had
  fainted.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chXXVIII"
     id="chXXVIII"></a>XXVIII.&mdash;ONE DAY'S RESPITE</h2>

  <p class="first">The sun has risen upon the last day which I shall spend on
  earth; and I sit down calmly to write all that happened to me yesterday, and
  my reason for the step which I am about to take.</p>

  <p>It is a fair still morning, and the birds are singing gaily in the grove.
  My window is open, and the early freshness of the autumnal air is filling the
  room. For hours I have been on my bed there, hot and restless, praying for
  the dawn, that I might carry out my purpose; and as soon as the first faint
  gleam of light in the east broke through the dark night clouds, I arose and
  bathed my eyes and sat down here to wait. I have watched the sun rise up from
  the ocean, slowly gathering strength until its first quivering beams glanced
  across the dull gray sea, and even penetrated into my chamber. And with the
  dawn has come peace. I sit here calm and prepared for the trial to come.</p>

  <p>It was the evening before yesterday when I saw my uncle's face pressed
  against the window pane, and fainted with the shock. Early on the following
  morning a note from him was brought up to me, having been left by a messenger
  from the village. Here it is:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My Beloved
  Margharita</span>,&mdash;Many a time have I reproached myself for my
  imprudence last night, and the effects which I fear it had upon you. It was
  thoughtless and rash of me to come near the house at all; but, indeed, I
  meant only to watch from a safe distance; only, as I crouched behind a shrub
  upon the lawn, I saw her face, and the sight drew me nearer against my better
  judgment. I met your eyes, and I knew that you were overcome with fright; but
  I feared to linger lest they might ask what it was that alarmed you, and seek
  for me. And although I fancy that I am altered past recognition, yet I would
  run no risks.</p>

  <p class="letter">I, too, had a great surprise, Margharita. You will not
  wonder what I mean by that when I tell you that in the light which streamed
  from the uncurtained window everything in the room was distinctly visible to
  me. Was I dreaming, child, or were you indeed assenting to the embrace of the
  man whose arms were surely around you? Him, I could not see, for his back was
  turned to the window; but will you laugh at me, I wonder, if I tell you that
  I felt strangely jealous of him. I am a foolish old man, Margharita, but all
  the love of my heart is yours, and I had begun almost to look upon
  you&mdash;in my thoughts&mdash;as my own child. I cannot bear the thought of
  giving you up to any one. You will not think me very, very selfish. I have
  only a few more months to live, and I know that you will not grudge that much
  out of your future, that you will stay by me to the end. Afterwards, I have
  no wish save for your happiness; and although I must confess that I had hoped
  you might have married one of the sons of our own country, still it is you
  who must choose, and I owe you, or shall owe you soon, too great a debt to
  press upon you any desire of mine which is not at one with your wishes. But
  tell me this&mdash;Is he an Englishman? Alas! I fear so. Send me a word by
  the bearer, and tell me; tell me, too, of what family he is, and whether he
  is noble. But of that I feel already assured, if he be indeed the man to whom
  your love is given.</p>

  <p class="letter">You must surely have sustained a shock at my sudden and
  rash appearance. Doubtless you wonder at seeing me here at all. I could not
  keep away. I must have news day by day, almost hour by hour. It is all that
  keeps me alive. I must be near to feel that I am breathing the same air as
  the woman on whom a long-delayed vengeance is about to fall.</p>

  <p class="letter">I have taken a furnished cottage on the outskirts of this
  village, and a little more than a mile from Mallory Grange. But do not come
  to me. Dearly as I would love to have you talk to me, and hear from your own
  lips that all goes well, yet at present it were better not. I will devise
  some means of communication, and let you know of it shortly. I am living here
  as Mr. Angus.&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

  <p class="letter">L. M."</p><br>

  <p>I folded up this letter with a shudder, and sitting down dashed off my
  reply. It is here:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My dear Uncle</span>,&mdash;I am a
  culprit&mdash;a miserable, pleading culprit. It is true that I love an
  Englishman&mdash;the man who was standing by my side last night; and it is
  true that he has asked me to marry him. But I have not told him so, and I
  have not promised to marry him. That is not all of my confession. Not only is
  he an Englishman, but his name is Lord Lumley St. Maurice, and he
  is&mdash;her son.</p>

  <p class="letter">Now you know the terrible trouble I am in. Last night he
  was telling me of his love, and assuring me of his mother's sanction and
  approval, when your face appeared at the window. Can you wonder at my start,
  and that I fainted? Can you wonder that I sit here, after a sleepless night,
  with eyes that are dim and a heart that has become a stone? I dread to stir
  from the room. My position is horrible. I have tried my utmost to avoid him,
  to treat him with disdain, to send him away from me. I have steeled my heart
  and clothed my face with frowns&mdash;in vain! The bald fact remains that I
  love him. Do you despise me, uncle? Sometimes I feel that I deserve it; but I
  have suffered, I am suffering now. I am punished. Do not add your anger to my
  load!</p>

  <p class="letter">Immediately you get this, sit down and write to me. Write
  to me just what is in your heart. Your words I shall set before me as my law.
  Do not delay, and, if you blame, do not fail to pity me.&mdash;Yours ever
  unchanged,</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Margharita</span>."</p><br>

  <p>I sent this letter off with a certain sense of relief, and then, finding
  by my watch that it was late, finished dressing hastily, and went down into
  the schoolroom. Instead of my pupil, Lord Lumley was there lounging in my low
  basket-chair, yawning over a German grammar. He sprang up as I entered, and
  throwing the book into a corner of the room, advanced toward me with
  outstretched hands.</p>

  <p>"Margharita, you are better, dear? I have been waiting here more than an
  hour for you."</p>

  <p>Then, before I could prevent him, he had kissed me. Let me be honest,
  though, here, at any rate. Did I really try to prevent him? I think not.</p>

  <p>"Where is Gracie?" I asked, looking round. "And what have you done to my
  <i>Ottos</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Gracie has gone out with the nurse," he answered, laughing, "and as for
  that wretched volume, well, I've got a good mind to send the rest after it.
  You've a nasty brain-worrying lot of lesson books here. I've been looking
  through them."</p>

  <p>"One cannot teach without them. Elementary books always look tiresome, but
  they are indispensable."</p>

  <p>"Not for you any longer, I'm glad to say," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>He looked at me, surprised.</p>

  <p>"Surely you don't expect to go on teaching that child?" he asked. "You are
  a visitor here now, and I am responsible for your entertainment. To commence
  with, I have invited myself to breakfast with you. The tray is here, as you
  perceive, and the kettle is boiling. Kindly make the tea."</p>

  <p>I did as I was bid, with a meekness which astonished myself, and he sat
  opposite to me. The servant brought in the remainder of the things, and
  closed the door. Gracie was not coming.</p>

  <p>"Well, how do you like the first item in my programme?" he asked, taking
  my hand for a moment between his. "A <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> breakfast was not a
  bad idea, was it?"</p>

  <p>"Does Lady St. Maurice know?" I asked, suddenly conscious of the utter
  impropriety of what we were doing.</p>

  <p>He laughed reassuringly.</p>

  <p>"Of course she does, sweetheart. In fact, she as good as suggested it. She
  thinks you feel a little strange about it all, and that a long, quiet day
  alone with me would help you to realize matters. Accordingly, I am having a
  luncheon basket packed, and after breakfast we are going for a sail, just you
  and I. You see the sea is as calm as a duck pond this morning. Shall you like
  it, do you think?"</p>

  <p>Like it! Oh! how long was this mockery to go on! How long before I could
  find strength to tell him the truth&mdash;that this thing could never be! I
  tried to tell him then, but the words died away upon my lips. I would give
  myself one more day. After that there must be action of some sort or other.
  My uncle's reply would have come, and I should know exactly what lay before
  me.</p>

  <p>"I should like it, yes," I answered, looking into my lover's handsome,
  glowing face. "You are sure that your mother will not mind&mdash;that she
  approves?"</p>

  <p>"Quite," he answered confidently. "We talked it over together for some
  time. To-night I am going to speak to my father. He has an inkling of it
  already, but he will expect me to tell him. Dearest, there is nothing to be
  frightened about. Why should you tremble so? You are not well?"</p>

  <p>"I shall be better out of doors," I answered faintly. "I will get my hat,
  and we will start."</p>

  <p>He rose up at once, and opened the door for me.</p>

  <p>"Do. There must be a little pink coloring in those cheeks before we get
  back," he said fondly.</p>

  <p>"Let us meet at the boat-house in a quarter of an hour. Shall you be ready
  by then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered. "I will be there."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chXXIX"
     id="chXXIX"></a>XXIX.&mdash;THERE IS DEATH BEFORE US</h2>

  <p class="first">I did not give myself time to think. I had made up my mind
  with a sort of desperate determination that this day should be my very own,
  my own to spend in paradise, without scruples or after thought. In a few
  minutes my black dress was changed for a navy blue one and a straw hat, and I
  was hurrying down to the beach. Our boat, a dainty little skiff, only large
  enough for two, was ready when I got there, and Lord Lumley was standing up
  unfurling the sail.</p>

  <p>I settled myself down comfortably in the cushioned seat, and we were off
  almost at once, gliding over the smooth surface of the water with a scarcely
  perceptible motion. We were about a quarter of a mile from the shore when we
  met Lord Lumley's yacht, rounding the point on her way back from Yarmouth.
  Lord Lumley stood up in the bows and hailed her.</p>

  <p>"All well, Dyson?" he cried, as she swept past.</p>

  <p>"All well, my Lord!" was the prompt reply.</p>

  <p>"Is the breeze stiffening, do you think? It's calm enough here, but I see
  the white horses are showing their heads outside the bay."</p>

  <p>"Ay! ay! my Lord, it's blowing hard round the headland. You'll have to
  keep her well away. Shall we take you up?"</p>

  <p>Lord Lumley shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You would not prefer the yacht?" he asked, turning to me.</p>

  <p>"I like this best," I answered. "It is more exciting."</p>

  <p>"We'll stick to the skiff, Dyson," Lord Lumley called out.</p>

  <p>The man looked doubtful; but while he hesitated, we shot far ahead, so
  that his voice only reached us faintly.</p>

  <p>"There's a heavy sea running, my Lord, and it'll blow great guns before
  night."</p>

  <p>"Are you nervous, Margharita?" he asked tenderly.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," I answered, carelessly wiping the spray from my face.
  "I like it, and hope it will be rougher."</p>

  <p>"Can't say that I do," he laughed. "What a plucky girl you are. Now that
  we're in a quieter sea, I think that I may venture to come and talk to
  you."</p>

  <p>So he came and sat by my side. It is not my purpose to set down all that
  passed between us that day. There are pages in our lives which we never
  willingly open; which have for us a peculiar sacredness, and a sweetness
  which never altogether fades away. There came a sort of abandon upon me, the
  forerunner of a fit of nervous desperation which well-nigh sent us both, hand
  in hand, into another world&mdash;closed the gates of my memory upon the
  past, and withdrew my shuddering thoughts from the future, to steep them in
  the delight of the present. My lover sat by my side, and his words were
  filling my heart with music. The strong sea breeze blew in our faces, and the
  salt spray leaped like glittering silver into the sunlight. Over our heads
  the sea-gulls screamed, and the coast line grew faint in the distance. So we
  sailed on, hand in hand, heart whispering to heart in the golden silence,
  till the sun lay low in the west, and our tiny craft pitched and tossed in
  the trough of the ocean waves.</p>

  <p>Then my lover suddenly became conscious of time and place, and he sprang
  up bewildered.</p>

  <p>"A miracle!" he cried. "The sun is low, and it cannot yet be
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Flatterer," I laughed, showing him my watch. "It is past five
  o'clock."</p>

  <p>He looked round as he gathered in the sail, and a shade of anxiety crept
  into his face. Especially he looked with bewildered eyes at the faint blue
  line where land lay.</p>

  <p>"What an idiot I have been," he said, knitting his brows. "Port,
  Margharita! The left string! That's right! Now, sit firm, and when we go
  down, lean to the other side. You mustn't mind if you get a little wet. We
  are running in the teeth of the wind, and it will be roughish."</p>

  <p>It was deliciously exhilarating. The breeze, without our noticing it, had
  been gradually freshening, and now it was almost a gale. The sky above was
  mackerel-hued and wind-swept. The sea seemed to be getting rougher every
  minute. Lord Lumley had to pass his arm round the frail mast which creaked
  and bent with the straining of the sail. Once we heeled right over, and were
  within an ace of being capsized. I only laughed, and the color came into my
  cheeks. Death would be a sweet and welcome thing, I thought&mdash;death here
  on the ocean, with my lover's arms around me. So I had no fear, and Lord
  Lumley found time to glance at me admiringly.</p>

  <p>"You're the pluckiest woman I ever knew in all my life!" he exclaimed
  lightly. "Gad! that was a shave! It's no use, dear, we must tack. This is too
  good to last."</p>

  <p>Round we swept, first one way then another, but we made no headway. In an
  hour's time we were no nearer land, and in the gathering twilight the coast
  line was dim and blurred. Here and there we could see a few lights burning
  from the villages along the shore, and away northward the revolving light
  from Gorton headland shone out like a beacon.</p>

  <p>"What will become of us?" I asked softly, for Lord Lumley had ceased his
  exertions for a moment with a little gesture of despair. His face was very
  pale, but it might have been from fatigue.</p>

  <p>"Nothing very serious. Fortunately the sail is a new one, and very strong.
  I think it will hold, and while it does, I can keep her in position. We shall
  be tacking about most of the night, though, I am afraid. It is such a
  provoking shifty wind. I can't depend upon it for a moment."</p>

  <p>"And supposing the sail went?"</p>

  <p>"We have the oars. It would be uncommonly hard work, rowing, but it would
  keep us afloat. It was just a chance that I put them in&mdash;a lucky one as
  it happens."</p>

  <p>"Supposing you had forgotten them, and that we had no oars?"</p>

  <p>Lord Lumley shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Don't add to the horrors," he said, smiling. "I'd rather not suppose
  anything of the kind. It's bad enough as it is."</p>

  <p>"There would be danger, then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"In what way?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Do you really want to know?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, please."</p>

  <p>"Well, we should drift out to sea, and the first heavy wave that caught us
  broadside would probably swamp us. The great thing is, you see, to keep our
  head to the waves. Are you cold, love?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head. I had no thought of it</p>

  <p>"Frightened?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it. Do I look it?"</p>

  <p>"That you don't," he answered, smiling. "You are brave, dearest. I shall
  never forgive myself for being so careless, though."</p>

  <p>I think that it was then that the madness first came to me. I held my
  hands up to my head, and strove to fight against that frantic impulse. The
  air seemed full of voices whispering to me to end by one swift stroke this
  hideous dilemma into which I had drifted of my own foolish will. It was so
  simple; so easy a manner of escape. And she, too, would be punished. In a
  manner, my oath would have been accomplished. What vengeance could be sweeter
  to the heart of that desolate old man than the death of her son&mdash;her
  only son? It could be done so easily, so secretly. And as for me, should I
  not die in his arms with his dear face pressed close to mine, his kisses upon
  my cold lips, and his voice the last to fall upon my ears? What was life to
  me, a pledged murderess? Would not such a death be a thousand times better?
  The wind rushing across the waters seemed to bring mocking whispers to my
  ears. I seemed to read it in the silent stars, and in the voices of the
  night. Death, painless and sudden. Death, in my lover's arms. My heart
  yearned for it.</p>

  <p>In the darkness I stretched down my hand, and felt for the oars. My
  lover's back was turned to me, for he was on his knees in the bows, gazing
  ahead with strained eyesight. One oar I raised and balanced on the side of
  the boat. A quick push, and it was gone. The dull splash in the water was
  lost in the rushing of the wind and the creaking of the ropes. I watched it
  drift away from us with anxious eyes. It was gone, irrevocably gone.</p>

  <p>There was only the sail now. I had not meant to touch that; to leave so
  much to chance, but the desire for death had grown. I was no longer mistress
  of myself. A small pocket-knife was lying in the bottom of the boat, and I
  stooped down cautiously and picked it up. Just as my fingers closed upon it,
  Lord Lumley looked round. My eyes fell before his, and I trembled, thankful
  for the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Frightened yet, dearest?" he asked tenderly.</p>

  <p>I laughed. There was no fear in my heart. If only he had known.</p>

  <p>"No! I am not afraid! I am happy!"</p>

  <p>He looked at me, wondering. Well he might!</p>

  <p>"How your eyes are gleaming, love! After all, I don't think that we need a
  lantern!"</p>

  <p>"A lantern! What use would it have been to us?"</p>

  <p>"To warn anything off from running us down. If the sail holds till
  morning, and I think it will, we shall be all right if we escape
  collisions."</p>

  <p>"Is that what you are fearing?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I fancy that we must be getting in the track of the coal steamers.
  If only the moon would rise! This darkness is our greatest danger! Even if
  they had a smart lookout man, I am afraid that they would never see us."</p>

  <p>He turned round again, and remained gazing with fixed eyes into the
  darkness. Then I held my breath, and stooping forward, with the penknife in
  my hand, commenced steadily sawing at the bottom knot which bound the sail to
  the mast. Directly it parted I cut a great slit in the sail itself.</p>

  <p>The knife was sharp, and my task was over in less than a minute. I dropped
  it into the sea, and leaned back breathless. The wind was coming.</p>

  <p>"Lumley!" I faltered, "will you come to me? I am afraid!"</p>

  <p>He turned round with a quick loving word. At that moment the catastrophe
  happened. A sudden gust of wind filled out the sail. There was a crash as it
  parted from the mast, a confused mass of canvass and limp rope. The whole of
  the strain for a moment was upon the topmost portion of the mast, and the
  result was inevitable. It snapped short, and the whole tangled heap fell
  down, half in the bottom of the boat, half in the sea.</p>

  <p>We heeled right over, and it seemed as if we must be capsized. But my
  lover had presence of mind, and a strong desire to live. He leaned heavily on
  the other side of the boat, and whipping a large sailor's knife from his
  pocket, cut away the whole of the wreckage from the stump of the mast with a
  few lightning-like strokes. It fell away overboard at once, and though we
  shipped a lot of water, the boat righted itself again. While it was yet
  trembling with the shock he leaned across to me, pale, but with no fear in
  his set face or his clear, resolute tone.</p>

  <p>"Courage, Margharita! The oars! Quick, dear!"</p>

  <p>Then for the first time my heart smote me for what I had done; for the
  passionate desire of life was alight in his eyes. What right had I to make
  him share my fate? My deep joy was suddenly numbed. I was a murderess!</p>

  <p>I handed him the remaining one, and pretended to feel about in the bottom
  of the boat. In that moment I recovered myself.</p>

  <p>"There is only one here," I announced calmly.</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" he cried. "I saw the pair laid out myself."</p>

  <p>He dropped on his knee and felt anxiously around. Then he struck a match;
  with the same result. The oar was gone.</p>

  <p>He knew then that my words were true, and he came over to my side with a
  great despair in his dark eyes.</p>

  <p>"Margharita!" he cried, taking me into his arms, "there is death before
  us, and it is I who have brought it upon you. Oh, my love, my love!"</p>

  <p>His kisses fell upon my lips, and my head fell upon his shoulder. Then I
  drew a sigh of deep content, and I felt that I had done well.</p>

  <p>"I do not mind," I whispered softly. "Let us stay like this. I am
  happy."</p>

  <p>"My darling!"</p>

  <h2><a name="chXXX"
     id="chXXX"></a>XXX.&mdash;THE DAWN OF A NEW LIFE</h2>

  <p class="first">To desire death is to live, and to desire life is to die. It
  is the mockery of human existence, the experience of all. I had willed to die
  at that moment, without further speech or opportunity for thought, and death
  seemed to have turned his back upon me.</p>

  <p>We drifted on, tossed high and low by the tall waves which rose around us
  like black shadows, threatening destruction at every moment. Often when we
  had seen one towering above us we had thought that the end had come, and I
  had felt my lover's arms tighten around me, and my lips had clung close to
  his. But again and again a reprieve was granted to us. Although every timber
  in our frail craft shivered, we survived the shock and drifted into smoother
  water.</p>

  <p>A little before midnight the wind dropped, although there was a heavy sea
  still running. Through a dimly woven mist we could see the stars faintly
  shining between the masses of black clouds rolling across the wind-swept sky.
  But there was no moon; nothing to show us whither we were drifting upon the
  waste of waters. There was something inexpressibly weird in that darkness. It
  seemed less a blank darkness than a darkness of moving shapes and
  figures&mdash;a living darkness, somehow suggesting death. It will live in my
  memory forever.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind dying, Lumley?" I asked him once.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered solemnly, "I do. I am just learning how sweet it would
  be to live."</p>

  <p>I held him tighter, for at that moment a great wave had broken over us. I
  dreaded nothing but separation.</p>

  <p>"Supposing that, if we lived, something came between us?" I whispered.
  "Suppose there was something between us which nothing could alter, nothing
  could move&mdash;what then?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot suppose it," he answered. "Nothing could come between us that I
  would not overcome&mdash;nothing in life."</p>

  <p>"Still, if it were so?" I persisted.</p>

  <p>"Then I would sooner die like this if we are to die. We are in God's
  hands."</p>

  <p>I shuddered at that last sentence. If indeed we were on the threshold of
  eternity, what had I to hope from God? Alas! at that moment my earthly love
  was so strong that the fear of death was weak and faint.</p>

  <p>We sat there silent and full of strange emotions, and expecting every
  moment the end to come. All of a sudden, we both of us gave a great cry, and
  my lover leaped up so that our boat rocked violently and nearly capsized. For
  my part, I sat still, gazing, with distended eyes and parted lips, upon the
  strangest sight which I had ever seen.</p>

  <p>A great blaze of brilliant light seemed suddenly to flash into the
  horizon, and falling into one long level ray, to travel slowly across the
  surface of the water toward us. Everything which lay in its path was revealed
  to us with minute and wonderful distinctness. So vivid was the illumination
  that we could see the white foam on the top of the green waves, and the
  floating seaweed rising and falling. Outside that one level blaze, more
  brilliant even than the sunlight, the darkness seemed blacker and more
  impenetrable than ever. It was a sight so marvelous that I held my breath,
  awed and wondering. Then my lover gave a great cry.</p>

  <p>"Margharita, my love, my love, we are saved!"</p>

  <p>"What is it?" I whispered.</p>

  <p>"The electric search light. I had it fitted to the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> by
  the purest chance a few months ago. Here it comes. Put your hand before your
  eyes, sweetheart. Oh, God, that they may see us!"</p>

  <p>Swiftly it passed across the great desert of waters, and reached us. We
  seemed suddenly bathed in a blinding glare of white light, and,
  notwithstanding our anxiety, were forced to cover our eyes. There was a
  moment's suspense. Then the sound of a cannon came booming across the sea,
  and a rocket sped up into the air.</p>

  <p>"Thank God! thank God!" my lover cried, "they have seen us. Look up,
  Margharita! They are more than a mile away now, but they will be here in a
  quarter of an hour. We are saved!"</p>

  <p>He was right. In less than that time a boat from the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>
  had picked us up, and we were standing in for land, firing rockets all the
  way to announce the news to Lord and Lady St. Maurice. So ended this, the
  most eventful day of my life.</p>

  <p>And with its close has ended that sworn purpose which has brought me here.
  I, Margharita di Marioni, as one day I had hoped to call myself, am about to
  disgrace the traditions and honor of my race. I am going to break my faith
  with a suffering old man. I am going to tell my uncle that my hand can work
  no harm upon any of this family.</p>

  <p>Before me here lies his answer to my letter&mdash;my confession to him.
  How he trusts me, when even now he never doubts.</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Margharita</span>,&mdash;I have
  received your letter, and I have pondered over it. You are young to have such
  a sorrow, yet I do not doubt but that you will act as becomes your race. You
  can never think of marriage with this man; you a Marioni, he a St. Maurice!
  Yet I grieve that you have let such a feeling steal into your heart. Pluck it
  out, Margharita, I charge you; pluck it out by the roots! Think not of the
  wrong done to me, or, if you do, think of me not as a man and your uncle, but
  as Count Leonardo di Marioni, the head of my family, the head of your family.
  We have been the victims, but the day of our vengeance is at hand. There is
  no life without its sorrows, child! In the days to come, happiness will teach
  you to forget this one.</p>

  <p class="letter">Farewell, my child. I shall send you no more notes. Write
  or come to me the moment the deed is done! Come to me, if you can; I would
  hear your own lips tell me the news. Yet do as seems best to you. In sympathy
  and love,</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">L. di M.</span></p>

  <p class="letter">One word more, child. Do not for a moment imagine that I
  blame you for what has happened. Old man though I am, I too know something of
  the marvels and the vagaries of this same love. Will can have little to do
  with its course. I, who have suffered so deeply, Margharita, can and do
  sympathize and feel for you."</p><br>

  <p>This is the letter. I shall seal it up with the others, and this little
  record of my life, on the last page of which I am now writing. When I leave
  here they will go with me.</p>

  <p>Yes, it is the dawn of a new day. Shall I ever see another, I wonder? I
  think not! For me, no longer will the sun rise and set, the breezes blow, and
  the earth be fair and sweet. All these things might have been so much to me,
  for I have held in my hand the key to an everlasting happiness&mdash;that
  deathless love which opens the gates to heaven; which sanctifies life and
  hallows death. Oh! forgive me that I leave you, my love! There was no other
  way. Only I pray that in that other world we may meet again in the days to
  come, and that the music of our love may ring once more through heart and
  soul. Farewell! Farewell!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chXXXI"
     id="chXXXI"></a>XXXI.&mdash;AN OLD MAN'S HATE</h2>

  <p class="first">"Margharita! You have come at last. It is done, then. Say
  that it is done!"</p>

  <p>She stood quite still in the humble red-tiled sitting-room, and looked at
  him with a great compassion shining out of her dark, clear eyes. He was worn
  almost to a shadow, and his limbs were shaking with weakness, as he half rose
  to greet her. Only his eyes were still alight and burning. Save for them he
  might have been a corpse.</p>

  <p>Something of the old passionate pity swept through her as she stood there,
  but its fierceness had died away. Her heart leaped no longer in quick
  response to the fire in those still undimmed eyes. She had been a girl then,
  a girl with all the fierce untrained nature of her mother's race; she was a
  woman now, a sad-faced, sorrowful woman. He was quick to see the change.</p>

  <p>"Margharita, my child, you have been ill."</p>

  <p>Still she did not answer. Silently she knelt down by the side of his
  armchair and took his withered, delicate hand in hers. A great bowl of white
  hyacinths stood on a table by the window, and the air was faint with their
  perfume.</p>

  <p>"I am not ill," she said gently. "I was frightened on my way here, and had
  to run. There was a fire last night at the lunatic asylum at Fritton, and
  some of the mad people have escaped. I saw one of them in the distance, and
  the keepers after him. They wanted me to go back, but I would come."</p>

  <p>He stooped down and kissed her forehead, with cold, dry lips.</p>

  <p>"I knew that you would be here soon," he said. "My letters reached you
  safely?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>She shuddered at the gathering strength in his tone, and the fierce light
  which had swept into his face.</p>

  <p>"It is done, child. Say that it is done!"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Something in her sad tone and subdued manner seemed to strike a note of
  fear in his heart. He leaned forward, grasping the sides of his chair with
  nervous, quivering fingers, and looked hurriedly into her face.</p>

  <p>"No; you have had no chance, then? But you will have soon? Is it not so?
  Soon, very soon?"</p>

  <p>She threw her arms around his neck. He made no response, nor did he thrust
  her away. He remained quite passive.</p>

  <p>"It is not that, uncle. Oh, listen to me. Do not thrust me away. I cannot
  do this thing."</p>

  <p>He sat as still as marble. There was no change, no emotion in his face.
  Yet her heart sank within her.</p>

  <p>"Oh, listen to me," she pleaded passionately. "You do not know her as she
  is now. She is good and kind&mdash;a gentle-hearted woman. It was so long
  ago; and it was not out of malice to you, but to save the man she loved. You
  hear me, do you not? You are listening. She has not forgotten you. Often she
  sorrows for you. It was cruel&mdash;I know that it was cruel&mdash;but she
  was a woman, and she loved him. Let us steal away together and bury these
  dark dreams of the past. I will never leave you; I will wait upon you always;
  I will be your slave. Forgiveness is more sweet than vengeance. Oh, tell me
  that it shall be so. Why do you not speak to me?"</p>

  <p>He sat quite still, like a man who is stunned by some sudden and
  unexpected blow. He seemed dazed. She wondered, even, whether he had heard
  her.</p>

  <p>"Uncle, shall it not be so?" she whispered. "Let us go away from here and
  leave her. I am not thinking about him. I will not see him again. I will
  never dream of marrying him. Let us go this very day, this very hour!"</p>

  <p>Then he turned slowly toward her, thrust her hand from around his neck,
  and stood up.</p>

  <p>"You have been false to me, Margharita," he said, in a slow, quiet tone.
  "After all, it is only natural. When you first came to me, I thought I saw
  your mother's spirit blazing in your dark eyes, and I trusted you. I was to
  blame. I forgot the tradesman's blood. I do not curse you. You do not
  understand, that is all. Learn now that the oath of a Marioni is as deathless
  and unchangeable as the hills of his native land. Will you go away at once,
  please? I do not wish to see you again."</p>

  <p>His speech so quiet, so self-contained, bewildered her. There was not a
  single trace of passion or bitterness in it. She stretched out her hands
  toward him, but she felt chilled.</p>

  <p>"Uncle, you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Will you go away, please?" he interrupted coldly.</p>

  <p>She turned toward the door, weeping. She had not meant to go
  far&mdash;only out on to the garden-seat, where she might sit and think. But
  he saw another purpose in her departure, and a sudden passion fired him. She
  heard his step as he rose hastily, and she felt his cold fingers upon her
  wrist.</p>

  <p>"You would go to warn her!" he cried, his voice trembling with anger; "I
  read it in your face. You are as false as sin, but you shall not rob me of
  the crown of my life! No one shall rob me of it! Vengeance belongs to me, and
  by this symbol of my oath I will have it!"</p>

  <p>He snatched a handful of white blossoms from the bowl, and crushed them in
  his fingers. Then he threw them upon the ground and trampled upon them.</p>

  <p>"Thus did she betray the sacred bonds of our Order when, for her lover's
  sake, she added treachery to cunning, and wrecked my life, made Leonardo,
  Count of the Marionis, the lonely inmate of prison walls, the scorn and pity
  of all men. Thus did she write her own fate upon a far future page of the
  tablets of time. Talk to me not of forgiveness or mercy, girl! My hate lives
  in me as the breath of my body, and with my body alone will it die!"</p>

  <p>His withered figure seemed to have gathered strength and dignity, and his
  appearance and tone, as he gazed scornfully down at the girl at his feet, was
  full of a strange dramatic force. Her heart sank as she listened to him. This
  was no idle, vulgar passion, no morbid craving for evil, which animated him.
  It was a purpose which had become hallowed to him; something which he had
  come to look upon as his sacred right. She understood how her drawing back
  must seem to him. As though a flash of light had laid bare his mind, she saw
  how weak, how pitifully weak, any words of hers must sound, so she was
  silent.</p>

  <p>He had commenced walking up and down the room; and, watching him
  fearfully, she saw that his manner was gradually changing. The unnatural calm
  into which he had momentarily relapsed was leaving him, and he was becoming
  every moment more and more excited. Fire flashed in his eyes, and he was
  muttering broken words and sentences to himself. Once he raised his clasped
  hands to the roof in a threatening gesture, and in the act of doing so she
  saw the blue flash of a stiletto in his breast pocket. It frightened her, and
  she moved toward the door.</p>

  <p>It seemed almost as though he read her purpose in her terror-stricken
  face, and it maddened him. He caught her by the wrist and thrust her
  back.</p>

  <p>"You shall not leave this room, girl!" he cried. "Wait, and soon I will
  bring you news!"</p>

  <p>She stood, still panting, overcome for a moment by the strength of his
  grip. Before she could recover herself, he had caught up his hat and was
  gone. Outside, she heard the sound of a key in the lock. She was a
  prisoner!</p>

  <p>Her first thought was the window. Alas! it was too small even for her to
  get her head through. She cried out. No one answered; there was no one to
  answer. She was alone in the cottage, and helpless, and away over the cliffs,
  toward Mallory Grange, she could see a small, dark figure walking steadily
  along, with bent head and swift steps. The cottage stood by itself, a mile
  from the village, and was approached only by a cliff path. She turned away
  from the window in despair. It seemed to her then that the time for her final
  sacrifice had indeed come.</p>

  <p>It was a warm, drowsy morning, and the air which floated in through the
  open lattice window was heavy with the perfume of flowers, mingled with the
  faint ozone of the sea. Outside, the placid silence was broken only by the
  murmurous buzzing of insects and the soft lapping of the tide upon the
  shingly sands. Within the room, a pale-faced girl knelt upon the floor, with
  her long, slim fingers stretched upward, and the passionate despair of death
  in her cold, white features. The sunshine laughed upon her hair, and glanced
  around her, bathing her beautiful face in its fresh, bright glory. Was it an
  answer to her prayer, she wondered&mdash;her prayer for peace and
  forgiveness? Oh, that it might be so! God grant it!</p>

  <p>There was no fear in her face, though only a moment before she had taken
  out and swallowed the contents of that little packet of poison which had
  burned in her bosom for those last few days. But there had been just one
  passing shade of bitterness. Her life had been so short, so joyless, until
  there had come to her that brief taste of wonderful, amazing happiness. She
  was young to die&mdash;to die with the delirium of that passionate joy still
  burning in her veins.</p>

  <p>"Yet, after all, it is best!" she whispered softly, at the end of that
  unspoken prayer; and with those words of calm resignation, a change crept
  softly in upon her face. It seemed almost as though, while yet on earth,
  there had come to her a touch of that exquisite spiritual beauty which
  follows only upon the extinction of all earthly passion, and the uplifting
  into a purer, sweeter life. And her eyes closed upon the sunlight, and
  darkness stole in upon her senses. She lay quite still upon the floor; but
  the smile still lingered upon her lips, making her face more lovely even in
  its cold repose than when the glow of youth and life had shone in her dark,
  clear eyes, and lent expression to her features. Saints like St. Francis of
  Assisi may die thus, but seldom women.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chXXXII"
     id="chXXXII"></a>XXXII.&mdash;THE KEEPING OF THE OATH</h2>

  <p class="first">"Help! For God's sake, help!"</p>

  <p>A woman's cry of agony rang out upon the sweet morning stillness. Count
  Marioni, who had been hurrying on with downcast head, stood still in the
  cliff path and lifted his head. It was the woman whose memory he had cursed
  who stood before him&mdash;the woman on whom his vengeance was to fall.</p>

  <p>Her face was as white as his own, and in the swiftness of her flight her
  hat had fallen away and her hair was streaming in the breeze. Yet in that
  moment of her awful fear she recognized him, and shrank back trembling, as
  though some unseen hand had palsied her tongue, and laid a cold weight upon
  her heart They stood face to face, breathless and speechless. A host of
  forgotten sensations, kindled by her appearance, had leaped up within the
  Sicilian's heart. He had indeed loved this woman.</p>

  <p>"Merciful God! to meet you here," she faltered. "You will help me? Oh, you
  will help me? My husband is being murdered there on the cliff by an escaped
  lunatic. Oh! Leonardo, save him, and you may strike me dead at your feet. It
  is I whom you should hate, not him. Oh, come! Come, or it will be too
  late!"</p>

  <p>He stood quite still, looking at her curiously.</p>

  <p>"And it is I to whom you dare to come for help&mdash;I whom you ask to
  save him&mdash;your husband? Adrienne, do you remember my words on the sands
  at Palermo?"</p>

  <p>She wrung her hands, frantically imploring.</p>

  <p>"How can I remember anything&mdash;think of anything, now? For the love of
  God, help him," she begged, seizing his hand. "That was all so long ago. You
  would not have him killed here before my eyes? Come! Oh, do come!"</p>

  <p>"Lead the way," he answered sternly. "Call your loudest for other help. I
  make no promise, but I will see this tragedy."</p>

  <p>She ran back along the path, and he followed her. They turned suddenly an
  abrupt corner, and came upon two men locked in one another's arms, and
  swaying backward and forward upon the short green turf. The lunatic, an
  immense fellow, more than six feet high, was clutching his opponent's throat
  with his left hand, while with his right he brandished a long table-knife
  with keenly-sharpened edge. The struggle was virtually over. The madman's
  strength was more than human, and desperately though he had struggled, Lord
  St. Maurice was lying exhausted and overcome in his arms.</p>

  <p>With a final effort he turned his head at the sound of footsteps, and saw
  them come&mdash;his wife and this shrunken little old man. But close at hand
  though they were, nothing could help him now. He saw the steel flashing in
  the sunlight, and he closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>The knife descended, but Lord St. Maurice remained unhurt. With a
  swiftness which seemed almost incredible, the Sicilian had sprung between
  them, and the knife was quivering in his side. Behind, the lunatic was
  struggling helplessly in the grasp of three keepers.</p>

  <p>There was a wild cry of horror from Lady St. Maurice, a choking gasp of
  relief from her husband, and a horrid chuckle of triumph from the madman as
  he gazed upon his handiwork. But after that there was silence&mdash;a deep,
  awe-stricken silence&mdash;the silence of those who stand in the presence of
  death.</p>

  <p>Count Marioni lay on the turf where he had sunk, very white and very
  still, with the blood dropping slowly from his wound upon the grass, and his
  eyes closed. At first they thought that he was already dead; but, as though
  aroused by Lady St. Maurice's broken sobs, he opened his eyes and looked up.
  His lips moved, and she stooped low down to catch the sound.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell Margharita that this was best?" he faltered. "I have heard
  a whisper from over the sea, and&mdash;and the White Hyacinth forgives. I
  forgive. She will understand."</p>

  <p>"Leonardo," she sobbed, "your vengeance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He interrupted her.</p>

  <p>"This is my vengeance!" he said. "I have kept my oath!"</p>

  <p>Then he closed his eyes, and a gray shade stole into his pallid face. A
  breeze sprung up from the sea, and the tall, blood-red poppies, which stood
  up all around him like a regiment of soldiers, bent their quivering heads
  till one or two of them actually touched his cheek. He did not move; he was
  dead.</p>

  <p class="first">Lord and Lady Lumley had lingered long in Rome, and now, on
  the eve of their departure, they had spent nearly the whole of a bright
  November afternoon buying curios of a wizened old dealer, whose shop they had
  found in one of the dark narrow streets at the back of the Piazza Angelo.
  Lady Lumley had taken up a curious old ring, and was examining it with a
  vague sense of familiarity.</p>

  <p>"Ten pounds for that ring, my lady," the curio dealer remarked, "and it
  has a history. You will see that it bears the arms and motto of the Marionis,
  once the most powerful family in Sicily. I had it from the late Count
  himself."</p>

  <p>Lady Lumley sank into the little chair by the counter, holding the ring
  tightly in her hand.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell us the history?" she asked in a low tone.</p>

  <p>The man hesitated.</p>

  <p>"If I do so," he said doubtfully, "will you promise to keep it absolutely
  secret?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, I have told it to no one yet, but I will tell it to you. Many
  years ago I was a chemist, and among my customers was Count Leonardo di
  Marioni. His history was a very sad one, as doubtless you may have heard.
  When he was quite a young man he was arrested on some political charge, and
  imprisoned for five-and-twenty years&mdash;a cruel time. Well, scarcely more
  than twelve months ago he came to me here, so altered that I found it hard
  indeed to recognize him. Poor old gentleman, when he had talked for a while,
  I felt quite sure that his long confinement had affected his mind, and his
  errand with me made me sure of it. He came to buy a celebrated poison which I
  used at one time to be secretly noted for, and I could tell from his manner
  that he wanted it for some fatal use. Well, I thought at first of refusing it
  altogether, but what was the use of that? Some one else would have sold him
  an equally powerful poison, and the mischief would be done all the same. So,
  after a little consideration, I made up quite an innocent powder, which might
  cause a little momentary faintness, but which could do no further harm, and I
  gave it to him as the real thing. I couldn't take money for doing a thing
  like that, so he pressed this ring upon me. You see, it really has a
  history."</p>

  <p>Lord Lumley took his wife's hand and pressed it tenderly. In the deep
  gloom of the shop the curio dealer could not see the tears which glistened in
  her dark eyes.</p>

  <p>"We will have the ring!" Lord Lumley said, taking a note from his
  pocket-book and handing it across the counter.</p>

  <p>The man held it up to the light.</p>

  <p>"One hundred pounds," he remarked. "I shall owe your lordship ninety."</p>

  <p>Lord Lumley shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, Signor Paschuli, you owe me nothing; it is I who owe you a wife.
  Come, Margharita, let us get out into the sunshine again."</p>

  <p>And Signor Paschuli kept the note. But he has come to the conclusion that
  all Englishmen traveling on their honeymoon are mad.</p>

  <h2><a name="tga"
     id="tga"></a>THE GREAT AWAKENING</h2>

  <p class="note">(This story begins with the opening lines of Chapter IX of
  the novel <i>A Sleeping Memory</i>, which was published in the UK as <i>The
  Great Awakening</i>.)</p><br>

  <p>Sir Powers Fiske, though far from being a sybarite, possessed a
  fundamental but crudely developed love of the beautiful. Before all things
  with him came his devotion to science and scientific investigation. But for
  his unexpected accession to the title and estates he would, without doubt,
  have become a denizen of Harley Street, and made his way without difficulty
  into the front ranks of his profession. With the passing away of all
  necessity for work came a curious era of half-doubtful dilettanteism, a time
  during which he read hugely, traveled a good deal, and finally returned to
  England with the seeds of a great unrest sown in his mind.</p>

  <p>Mysticism and psychology, which he had dabbled in at first
  half-contemptuously, had become serious studies to him. Dimly he felt the
  fascination of that unending effort which from the days of the Chaldeans had
  swayed the lives of a long succession of the world's masters, the effort to
  establish some sort of communication, however faint, however speculative,
  between the world of known things and the world beyond. At times he found
  himself moved to the most profound self-ridicule. He would ask himself how it
  was possible for a man of science seriously to investigate problems whose
  very foundation must be an assumption. He looked at his walls lined with
  books, and he smiled grimly as he realized how little, after all, they had
  taught him. The sum of all that he had learned from them amounted to nothing.
  Yet he remembered what Spencer Trowse, a fellow student, had said to him. A
  sudden flush had lightened his thin cheeks, pallid with the ceaseless energy
  of their student life.</p>

  <p>"After all, Powers, I think that we are wasting our days," he exclaimed.
  "Those ancients saw no farther behind the veil than we. I am tired of all
  this musty lore, this delving among cobwebs."</p>

  <p>"What then?" Powers had asked. "Modern scholarship has taught us little
  enough."</p>

  <p>"Let us have done with all scholarship," Trowse answered. "It is the laws
  of humanity we want to understand. Let us study them at first hand. Let us go
  down among the people."</p>

  <p>"What can this rabble teach us?" Powers had asked himself, full of the
  intellectual contempt of the young student for the whole pleasure-loving
  world. "Whether their wings be soiled or pure, they are only
  butterflies!"</p>

  <p>Trowse smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"They are the living evidences," he said, "of laws which are worth
  studying. If we would understand humanity we must not start by despising any
  part of it."</p>

  <p>With characteristic impetuosity the two young men had thrown themselves
  heart and soul into their new enterprise. They haunted police courts and
  places of entertainment. They lived for a while in a great industrial center;
  they listened to the hoarse, tragic undernote of the millions underneath.
  They made their bow at the reception of a duchess, and spent a whole Bank
  Holiday dancing upon Hampstead Heath. These and many other phases of life
  they had encountered with an amusement, in Powers' case partly genuine, in
  Trowse's wholly tolerant. For all the time they kept strenuously in view
  their real end. They wanted to understand the causes of all that they saw;
  they wanted to discover laws.</p>

  <p>The end of their enterprise came suddenly. A disaster in his family left
  Trowse unexpectedly poor. It was necessary for him to take at once some
  wage-earning position. The two young men parted, curiously enough, without
  regret. Powers, though no sentimentalist, possessed his due share of the
  affections, had an innate love for the beautiful, and a longing for a
  catholic and universal understanding of his fellows. Where Trowse would gaze
  with unmoved face, and pursue his calm calculations, Powers could only peer
  with barely veiled horror. They held together through those three years of
  unorthodox study, but toward the end of it they had drawn wide apart. Trowse
  entered the ranks of his profession a man of steel, without nerves or
  sentiment or pity. Powers, with his fuller understanding of life, had no
  longer any desire for a regular career. Possessed of ample means, the
  necessity for it had never existed. He left England almost at once, and
  entered upon a somewhat restless but comprehensive scheme of travel.</p>

  <p>At last, shortly after his return home, one afternoon fate cast into his
  way on the Edgware Road the very subject that he sought. It was in the fringe
  of a city fog; the sky was heavy with clouds, the pavements were sloppy with
  recent rains; the broad thoroughfare was almost deserted when there glided by
  him the figure of a woman who held herself with a distinction oddly at
  variance with her shabby clothes. There was in her eyes the look of one in
  extremity&mdash;of a woman who had none of the ordinary fear of death and who
  would dare great things to pass from the evil place in which fate had set her
  to even a momentary draft from the cup of life.</p>

  <p>Sir Powers Fiske approached her. His eyes held hers&mdash;they were bright
  with a certain steely radiance. She felt her heart beating fast, the noise of
  the traffic beyond seemed to her to come from some distance. He spoke to her,
  and her eyes which mirrored dark months lost resentment after a moment and
  seemed to understand.</p>

  <p>They gazed steadfastly at one another&mdash;something greater than their
  surroundings, greater even than themselves seemed to pass between them. With
  swift intelligence, she felt him to be no more a boulevardier than she was
  light. He murmured a few conventionalities and when he asked her to have tea
  with him she accepted. Inside the warm little tea-room, he told her of his
  work and of himself, and once secure in the knowledge of the mere unit of
  humanity she represented to him, she told him of herself. The human note was
  strong in all she said, and he declared in all her talk the marks of a
  cultured intellect that must have rendered beyond endurance the shoddy
  environment of a draper's establishment where she passed her days. He offered
  her the means of escape from her present slavery by becoming his subject for
  experiment and she did not shrink. On her own testimony she stood alone in
  the world and upon her sudden removal from her present life there would be no
  one with even the right to search for her. He looked into her frail beautiful
  face marveling at the depth of misery which produced this brave despair and
  rising held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"I must thank you very much for your society&mdash;and for your
  confidence," he said, "I have your address and I will write to you."</p>

  <p>To-night he was in a curiously disturbed mood. All the evening Eleanor
  Surtoes had figured in his thoughts. He had seen her several times since that
  first meeting on the Edgware Road. She was one of the more tragic figures in
  that world which he had spent so much strenuous effort seeking to understand.
  The possibilities in connection with her loomed large in his imagination. He
  was oppressed with fears which were altogether new to him. Fortune could
  never have provided him with a human creature modeled more exactly according
  to his requirements. He knew her life and the ways of it. The confidence
  which he felt as to her ultimate decision was not exaggerated. She would come
  to him for an explanation of his words, and she would accept his proposition.
  Yet never since his idea had first begun to loom large in his thoughts did he
  look upon it with less enthusiasm than at this moment. A few hours ago he had
  written to her&mdash;asked her to spend a day upon the river with him. He
  knew that she would come. The crisis was close at hand. He hoped to be able
  to delay it.</p>

  <p>The door was quietly opened. His servant stood upon the threshold.</p>

  <p>"There is a young lady asking for you, Sir Powers&mdash;the name, I
  believe, is Surtoes."</p>

  <p>"Show her in at once."</p>

  <p>The man bowed. A moment later he ushered Eleanor in. Her hat was beaten
  about with wind and rain, even her hair was disordered. She was breathless
  with rapid walking, her cheeks were wet, and the raindrops hung about her
  clothes. Powers held out his hand and drew her toward the fire.</p>

  <p>"So you have come to see me," he said, in a tone as nearly matter-of-fact
  as he could make it. "I am delighted! I was just looking forward to a lonely
  and a particularly dull evening."</p>

  <p>He wheeled an easy chair to the fire, and placed her in it. He saw that
  she was nervous and embarrassed, and he continued to talk.</p>

  <p>"To-night," he said, "is one of the most horrible instances of our
  marvelous climate. I had just written to ask you to have a day upon the river
  with me. Imagine it."</p>

  <p>She smiled, and the color began to reappear in her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I want you, please, to tell me the exact truth," she said. "My coming
  here, I know, is very foolish. I want to know whether it inconveniences you
  in any way&mdash;whether your mother or any one else might think it
  strange?"</p>

  <p>He laughed reassuringly.</p>

  <p>"Mine is entirely a bachelor establishment," he declared. "My mother and
  sister live in Berkeley Square. There is no one here to whom your visit would
  be even a subject of remark."</p>

  <p>She gave a little sigh of relief, and leaned back in her chair. The warmth
  and comfort of the room after that dreary walk through the rain and hail
  outside were like a strong, sweet sedative. A curious sense of rest, of
  finality, took possession of her. With the closing of the front door, with
  the first breath of that air of indefinable luxury which everywhere pervaded
  her new surroundings, she seemed to pass into a new order of things. There
  had been a single moment of breathless excitement, of trembling speculation
  as to the nature of his greeting, but his welcome had been so easy and
  natural that her fears had been all dispelled by his first few words.</p>

  <p>"It is perhaps very foolish of me to come here," she said, "but I have
  never quite forgotten what you said to me in the tea-room. It was probably
  nonsense. If so, please tell me, and let me go."</p>

  <p>His brows went up in vague surprise; then ignoring her words, he lighted a
  cigarette, and stood thoughtfully puffing it, his elbow resting on the broad
  oaken mantelpiece.</p>

  <p>"I must tell you something more about myself," he said, presently. "It
  chanced that when I was at Calcutta several years ago, I met a native Indian
  doctor to whom I was fortunate enough to be of some service. My meeting with
  this man was the most wonderful thing which has ever happened to me. I shall
  never cease to be grateful to him. If the world knew his name and what he has
  made possible to science, he would be the most famous man of this or any
  generation. He reawakened all my old interest in my profession."</p>

  <p>His pale face had become fervid, the bright light of the enthusiast was
  burning in his dark eyes. Eleanor felt that she had become once more only a
  unit in his eyes, a mere atom of humanity, whose interest to him was purely
  scientific and impersonal. She found herself trembling. What had these things
  to do with her? She was afraid of what might come. She remembered that he had
  spoken of death.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that wonderful East," he continued, in a low tone. "How puny it makes
  us feel with our new civilization, our shoddiness, our materialism, which is
  only another name for hopeless ignorance. What treasures of art lie buried
  there, what strange secrets sleep forever in the tombs of their wise men.
  Halkar told me that he was but the disciple of one immeasurably greater, who
  had died, indeed, with many of the primal secrets of existence locked in his
  bosom because there was no one left behind with whom he dared to trust
  them."</p>

  <p>"Tell me about these secrets," Eleanor said. "Were they of the past, or of
  the future? And what have you or I to do with them?"</p>

  <p>"We are children of the ages," he answered, "and it is our heritage to
  learn. Halkar taught me much. He set me down at the gate of that wonderful
  inner world. He placed in my hands the key. With your aid, it is possible
  that I may pass inside."</p>

  <p>"With my aid!" Eleanor exclaimed breathlessly. "How can that be? What
  could I do?"</p>

  <p>He smiled at her, and Eleanor felt again that vague fear stirring in her
  heart.</p>

  <p>"One day Halkar took me to a native village. We went to the house of a
  rich man. We found him at home, just returned from hunting. He was handsome,
  hospitable, and, it seemed to me, intelligent. But just before we left Halkar
  asked him a question about the great storm which laid waste the village and
  the whole countryside only a year before. He looked puzzled, answered us
  courteously, but vaguely. He remembered nothing."</p>

  <p>He paused.</p>

  <p>"There was an English nurse-girl," he continued. "Halkar took me to see
  her. She was plump, rosy, and good-natured. She was engaged to be married to
  a gentleman's servant, and she chattered away gaily, and told me all about
  it. A year before a mad fakir had run amuck, had killed a soldier to whom she
  was to have been married the next day, and both the children who had been in
  her charge. The shock had nearly sent her mad. Yet when Halkar spoke to her
  of these things she looked puzzled. She remembered nothing."</p>

  <p>"Well?" Eleanor asked.</p>

  <p>"Their memory," he said slowly, "was gone. Their reason was saved. Halkar
  was the physician."</p>

  <p>She shivered, and sat looking into the fire with eyes full of fear.</p>

  <p>"Halkar," he said, "had learned much, but there was more still. It has
  taken me many years, but at last I believe that I have learned the secret
  which baffled him all his days. All that I need is a subject."</p>

  <p>There was a short, tense silence. Eleanor sat quite still, nervously
  clasping and unclasping her hands, her eyes steadfastly fixed upon the fire.
  He watched her covertly.</p>

  <p>"You know so little of me," she murmured, "I am almost a stranger to you.
  How can you tell whether I should be suitable&mdash;even if I were
  willing?"</p>

  <p>"You will remember the two cases which I have mentioned to you," he
  answered. "The man was chosen by Halkar because in the great storm he had
  lost wife, and friends, and children, and in his grief he prayed for
  forgetfulness. The girl was chosen because the tragedy which she had
  witnessed had driven her far along the road to madness, and this merciful
  loss of memory was her salvation, also. The reason you have been chosen is
  because I looked into your eyes, and it seemed to me that I saw there more
  than the ordinary weariness of life. Then I heard you speak, and in your
  tone, too, was more than the ordinary bitterness of misfortune. Listen, I
  will tell you more. I will tell you what as yet I have not breathed to a
  living soul."</p>

  <p>She caught his enthusiasm&mdash;a fierce, compelling thing.</p>

  <p>"You are a Christian?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I have tried to be," she faltered.</p>

  <p>"You believe, at least, in the eternity of human life? You must believe in
  it. In nature there is no death, no annihilation. All that takes place is
  transmutation! That is obvious," he declared.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"So in human life! The body rots; the spirit passes&mdash;where?"</p>

  <p>He continued with scarcely a moment's pause:</p>

  <p>"Down the broad avenues of time, to appear in a thousand different forms
  and shapes. A king in one age is a serf in another, a savage this century is
  a scholar in the next. Has there never been a moment in your life when a
  sense of unreality has seized you? You doubt for a moment your own identity,
  you are haunted by miragelike thoughts, beautiful, or sad; you are strangely
  out of touch with your surroundings. Watch a great concourse of people. It is
  the most fascinating thing in the world.</p>

  <p>"You will see a beggar who has now and then some trick of carriage or
  gesture or speech which has survived his body's degradation, and which
  reminds you of a king. Or you will see one of the great ones of the earth, if
  you watch closely enough, do some small thing, or speak some chance word
  which has crept out unheeded, very likely repeated, yet which could have no
  kinship with his present state.</p>

  <p>"There are people who have visited a strange country for the first time in
  their lives, and found there a street-corner, a shop, or byway which has
  awakened a peculiar and inexplicable sense of familiarity. They have never
  been there before, never read of the place, yet the sense of familiarity is
  there. I have seen a boy fall asleep, and heard him croon an old Mexican
  war-song, a song of the time of Cortez and the Incas, in an almost forgotten
  language&mdash;a boy who awake is a messenger at a draper's, unimaginative,
  ignorant, stupid. The secret of these things will one day be yielded up to
  science. You and I together may become immortal."</p>

  <p>He ended with a little laugh. The fierce eagerness had burned itself out.
  Of the two, Eleanor was now the more disturbed.</p>

  <p>"I should like to know how it feels," she said thoughtfully, "to be
  without a memory, to start life at twenty-two."</p>

  <p>"The things outside your own personal experiences are never lost to you,"
  he said. "They come back in a perfectly effortless manner. You will find
  yourself accepting them as a matter of course."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that?" she asked. "One might have to learn to read and
  write again. Life without any background at all would become a gigantic
  embarrassment."</p>

  <p>"There is no fear of anything of the sort," he assured her. "Halkar's
  friend and the girl related to me their own experiences. They were precisely
  similar. It was of events and persons alone that their mind was swept bare.
  Their stock of acquired knowledge remained unimpaired. Sometimes they even
  dimly remembered people."</p>

  <p>"But there are also many other considerations," she said. "What will
  become of me afterward?"</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady," he said, "I do not ask you to risk your life,
  however remotely, for nothing. I would give half my fortune, were it
  necessary, to win your consent. As it is, I promise you freedom and
  independence. You shall live the life which seems good to you. You will be
  removed into another sphere altogether, and it is possible that you may take
  with you a somewhat cloudy recollection of this portion of your life. Your
  reward will be an established position in the world and an honorable one.
  Beyond this I cannot say a single word. In fact, you must consider the whole
  thing as only a possibility.</p>

  <p>"I consent," she said simply.</p>

  <p>There was a momentary flash in his gray eyes&mdash;otherwise he showed no
  emotion. He had long since taken her consent as a matter of course.</p>

  <p>"There is one thing more which is necessary," he said. "You must tell me
  who you are, and if you have any friends who would be likely to make
  inquiries for you. I take it for granted that you have no closer ties. It is
  imperative that I have this knowledge."</p>

  <p>She looked up at him with white face. "Do you mean that?"</p>

  <p>"You can surely see the necessity for it yourself," he answered. "You are
  virtually going to change your identity. The Eleanor Surtoes of a month hence
  will know nothing of your past. Some one must be entrusted with that
  knowledge."</p>

  <p>"It is a great pain to me," she said wearily, "to speak of it at all. But
  to-night nothing seems to matter. My name is Eleanor Surtoes Marston. My
  father was Sir Robert Marston. He was a banker at Hull&mdash;Ellifield,
  Marston and Ellifield. You read the papers. I dare say you remember."</p>

  <p>He inclined his head slowly.</p>

  <p>"My mother was dead. I had neither brother nor sister, nor any friends
  save those whom my father's prodigality had brought together. When exposure
  came, my father killed himself. He left a letter telling me where to find a
  large sum of money which he had put on one side. He had meant to leave
  England secretly. I returned the money to the bank. They heard afterward that
  I was destitute, and they sent me ten pounds. I came to London, and did my
  best to get a situation, but I was ignorant, ill brought up, and uselessly
  educated. I could do a great many things in a small way, but nothing well
  enough to teach. With only a few shillings left, I wrote to a large firm of
  drapers in Hull with whom I had dealt. They sent me an introduction to
  Bearmain's, and I entered their employ as a shop girl ten months ago. I have
  done my best, but I left to-night, knowing that whatever happened I should
  never return."</p>

  <p>"There is no one, then," he asked, "who is likely to make inquiries about
  you? No one who could trace you here?"</p>

  <p>"There is no one," she answered bitterly.</p>

  <p>Powers looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"I am going to leave you alone for a quarter of an hour," he said. "I do
  not think that it will make any difference, but I should like you to have
  that time for unbiased reflection."</p>

  <p>"As you like," she answered. "I shall not change my mind. I am ready."</p>

  <p>She sat before the fire, her eyes fixed upon the burning coals. She heard
  muffled voices in the hall, she heard Powers enter an adjoining room, and
  close the door behind him. Her fingers clutched the sides of her chair, her
  eyeballs were hot. For the first time a spasm of physical fear seized her. He
  had gone to make ready. What if it should be death? She had spoken boldly of
  it but a moment before. Yet she was young, for good or evil her life was as
  yet unlived. Then with a rush came back the memory of the last ten months.
  The hopeless weariness of those days behind the counter, the miserable
  humiliation of it, the web of bitter despair drawn so closely and inevitably
  around her. All the petty tyrannies to which she had been subject, all the
  fettering restrictions which had gone to turn servitude into slavery were
  suddenly fresh in her mind. A hideous vista of dreary days and lonely
  nights&mdash;nowhere a ray of hope; the same, yesterday, to-day, and all
  other days. The fear passed away from her. Death might have its terrors, but
  a return to Bearmain's would be a living hell. She heard the door open
  without a single tremor. She even smiled as she saw Powers standing upon the
  threshold.</p>

  <p>"You have not changed your mind?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"There was never any fear of that," she answered. "I am quite ready."</p>

  <p>He held open the door. "Will you come this way?" he said.</p>

  <p>She rose at once, without reluctance or fear&mdash;even gladly. He was
  beckoning her into a new life.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Sir Powers Fiske permitted himself the luxury of a rare
  emotion. His patient had come back to life. The faint flush of recovery was
  upon her cheeks, the light of a dawning intelligence was in her eyes. The
  first stage of his great experiment had been successfully reached.</p>

  <p>"So you are better, I see!" he remarked, standing by her bedside.</p>

  <p>She answered him a little weakly, but distinctly enough.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I am. I feel quite well enough to get up.
  Only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>There was trouble in her eyes as she looked up at him.</p>

  <p>"It seems as though I must be dreaming. I can't remember what has happened
  to me&mdash;why I am here!"</p>

  <p>He smiled at her reassuringly.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't bother about it," he said. "You are with friends, and you must
  try to get well quickly. I dare say when you are stronger that it will all
  come back to you."</p>

  <p>She looked at him reflectively.</p>

  <p>"You are a stranger to me," she said slowly. "Is there no one here whom I
  have ever seen before?"</p>

  <p>He felt a sudden chill. Yet, after all, it was what he had expected.</p>

  <p>"I do not suppose that there is," he answered. "You see, you are in London
  now. I thought, perhaps, that you might have remembered me. I was in India,
  and came to see you when you were a little girl."</p>

  <p>"In India!" she repeated vaguely. "Why, what can have happened to me? I do
  not remember anything about India."</p>

  <p>She raised her hand to her temples. Her eyes were full of an undefined
  fear. The words came from her lips in a broken stream.</p>

  <p>"You are my doctor, they say, and this is your house. Tell me what it
  means&mdash;tell me. I try to think, and there is nothing. Something has
  happened to my head. Have I been ill for long? Who am I? Where did I come
  from? Why am I here?"</p>

  <p>"I will answer all your questions," he said quietly, "but you must please
  not excite yourself. Your name is Eleanor Hardinge, and you were shipwrecked
  on your way from India here. Your father is an old friend of mine, and you
  were coming to England to visit my mother. You met with a very unusual
  accident. You will notice that your head is still bound up, and, no doubt, it
  will affect your memory for some little time. You must try to make the best
  of it. You are among friends, and we shall all do our best to look after
  you."</p>

  <p>She felt the bandage around her head.</p>

  <p>"I can't even remember the accident," she said. "I suppose it will all
  come back some day."</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt about it," he answered. "All that you have to do now is
  to keep as quiet as you can. The less you try to think the better."</p>

  <p>The nurse entered with a tray. Eleanor sat up and smiled with the
  satisfaction of a child.</p>

  <p>"You are hungry!" he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I think so," she answered. "I should like some chicken, please. No more
  beef tea."</p>

  <p>"You remember what chicken tastes like, then," he said. "That is a proof,
  you see, that your memory still lives. Let me ask you another question. Who
  is your favorite author?"</p>

  <p>"Shakespeare!" she answered promptly.</p>

  <p>He nodded approvingly.</p>

  <p>"You see that you need have no fear," he said. "Your loss of memory is
  only partial. Now, I am going to leave you to have your dinner. Do not talk
  too much, and try to sleep as much as you can."</p>

  <p>Her eyes sought his fixedly, pathetically. She seemed suddenly moved by a
  new fear. Her large eyes, a little sunken now, were dilated.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I have forgotten my name again," she cried. "It is horrible. What
  is it. Tell me quickly."</p>

  <p>"You are Eleanor Hardinge," he said. "You are perfectly safe, and you will
  soon be quite well."</p>

  <p>"But I am afraid," she cried, with a sudden shrill note of terror. "My
  head is going round. I cannot think clearly."</p>

  <p>He took her hand in his. There was something soothing in the touch of his
  firm, cool fingers.</p>

  <p>"You have no cause for fear," he said reassuringly&mdash;"none whatever.
  You are getting better and stronger every hour."</p>

  <p>She raised herself a little from among the pillows. Her eyes sought his
  eagerly. Her hands refused to let his go.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," she moaned. "There are shadows everywhere among my
  thoughts. Tell me. Have I been mad? Am I going to be mad?"</p>

  <p>His fingers strayed to her pulse. He smiled upon her as one smiles upon a
  child.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! Look at me."</p>

  <p>His eyes held her.</p>

  <p>"You are not going to be mad. You are merely suffering from a great shock.
  By and by everything will be clear to you. You must not be impatient. I
  promise you that you will soon be well."</p>

  <p>Outside the door on the landing he stood and wiped the dampness from his
  forehead. He knew that she had been on the verge of brain fever, that even
  now she was scarcely safe. The impulse which had taken him into her room was
  an irresistible one. He felt that he must see her. He had looked into her
  opened eyes, he had heard her speak. The change, which he alone could
  understand, which he alone was responsible for, appalled him. He was
  bewildered by a feeling of personal loss. The soul of Eleanor Surtoes seemed
  to have passed away with her sense of personal consciousness. It was another
  woman who lay there in his guest-chamber.</p>

  <p>Afterward she slept. He dined mechanically, and without the ghost of an
  appetite. The rest of the night he spent with a pile of medical books and a
  note-book kept during his stay in India open before him. In the early morning
  he looked out upon the gray dawn-lit streets, haggard, and with a gnawing
  fear at his heart. He was unnerved. The ordinary sounds of the waking
  household, the street cries outside, the rattling of carts, jarred upon him.
  He glanced in the looking-glass, and was startled at his own reflection.
  Softly he opened the door and made his way into the room where Eleanor
  lay.</p>

  <p>Her deep-brown hair lay about the pillow in some confusion. One long white
  arm, thin but graceful, hung over the coverlet. Her face, notwithstanding its
  pallor, was like the face of a little child. A certain, almost pathetic,
  sharpness of outline, which in the days of his first acquaintance with her
  had been only too noticeable, seemed to him to have faded away. Her closed
  eyes were no longer windows through which shone the tragical misery of her
  bitter life. The lines about her mouth and forehead had all been smoothed
  away. And with these things&mdash;something else. He found himself struggling
  with a sense of unfamiliarity. After all, it was still Eleanor. If only he
  could persuade himself of it.</p>

  <p>He looked at her long and steadily. Then he left the room and entered the
  library. For a time he sat at his desk, irresolute. More than once he drew
  note-paper toward him and dipped his pen in the ink. He was wholly
  unaccustomed to this indecision. Yet the way before him, which had seemed so
  clear only a short while back, seemed now beset with anxieties. It was not
  technical skill or knowledge that he needed. So far as these were concerned,
  his self-confidence was unimpaired. Only a new sense of responsibility, a
  strange new web of fears, seemed suddenly to have paralyzed his
  enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>For the first time in his life he felt the need for advice&mdash;the
  stimulus of sympathy. Yet for hours that note remained unwritten. He was
  unable to account for his hesitation. The man whom he was about to summon
  would approve of all that he had done. He was sure of that. Yet he was
  oppressed by the shadow of some nameless fear, some instinct that seemed to
  be doing its utmost to warn him against this course which, from any ordinary
  point of view, was both natural and advisable. Afterward those hours of
  hesitation ranked as history with him. At the time he was ashamed of
  them.</p>

  <p>The note was written at last, and despatched by an urgent messenger. He
  bathed, changed his clothes, and ate some breakfast. Just as he had finished,
  a small brougham stopped at the door. Doctor Trowse was announced. It was the
  man for whom he had sent. Even at the moment of his entrance, Powers found
  himself struggling with an insane desire to abandon his purpose, to invent
  some trifling excuse and to keep silence.</p>

  <p>The two men shook hands silently.</p>

  <p>Trowse looked ten years younger than his age, which was forty-five, and he
  was now the greatest known authority upon diseases of the brain. He eyed
  Powers curiously.</p>

  <p>"What is wrong with you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," replied the other.</p>

  <p>"You sent for me," Trowse reminded him, "and if you waste my time you'll
  have to pay for it. These are my busiest hours."</p>

  <p>Powers came back to the present. It was too late to hesitate. He smiled
  grimly.</p>

  <p>"You won't want payment," he said, "when you have heard why I sent for
  you."</p>

  <p>A light like the flashing of fire upon polished steel lit up for a moment
  those strange-colored eyes. Yet in other respects the man was unmoved. Not a
  muscle of his face twitched.</p>

  <p>"You have found a subject?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I have."</p>

  <p>"You are going to attempt the operation, or you want me to?"</p>

  <p>"It is done."</p>

  <p>Trowse set down his hat, and deliberately selected a chair.</p>

  <p>"You've pluck!" he remarked. "Dead or alive?"</p>

  <p>"Alive."</p>

  <p>The absence of any sentiment of triumph in Powers' face or tone made its
  impression upon the older man. He decided at once that the thing had gone
  wrong.</p>

  <p>"Alive! In what condition is he?"</p>

  <p>"It's a she," Powers answered.</p>

  <p>"Better subject perhaps. Go on."</p>

  <p>"She has recovered consciousness. So far everything has gone according to
  calculation."</p>

  <p>"You administered your Indian drug?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I was going to tell you. She is conscious, and physically
  unhurt"</p>

  <p>"The memory?"</p>

  <p>"Gone!"</p>

  <p>Trowse rose briskly.</p>

  <p>"Let me see her," he insisted. "Then we will talk."</p>

  <p>Silently they made their way to the bedroom. She had made a somewhat
  fastidious toilet, and wore, with the air of one who has been used to such
  things all her life, a dressing-jacket trimmed with lace, which was among the
  things which Marian Fiske had sent. Her hair was tied up with ribbon, and
  skilfully arranged to hide the bandages on her head. The delicacy of her face
  and hands seemed heightened by the faint spot of color which flushed her
  cheeks as the two men entered the room.</p>

  <p>"I have brought a friend of mine," Powers said after a few words to
  Eleanor and the nurse, "to congratulate me upon my case. This is Doctor
  Trowse, nurse. I know that he considers me a dangerous amateur, and I want to
  convince him that I am nothing of the sort."</p>

  <p>Trowse moved a little forward, and Eleanor turned her head to meet his
  earnest gaze. Almost immediately there was a change in her expression. The
  color faded from her cheeks, she shrank a little away, a curious, troubled
  light filled her eyes. Trowse, if he noticed her agitation, ignored it. He
  bent over the bedside, and touched her fingers, asked a few apparently
  careless questions, and let his hand rest for a moment upon her head. Then he
  turned away and addressed the nurse.</p>

  <p>"Sir Powers has justified himself," he said, with a faint smile. "Your
  patient is going to have the good sense to get well very quickly."</p>

  <p>Eleanor drew a little breath, as though immensely relieved. She turned her
  head a little, so as to leave him altogether out of her range of vision.
  Powers, who, to some extent, misunderstood her action, exchanged quick
  glances with Trowse. The desire for life was there once more, then.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear it, sir," the nurse answered quietly. "She seems to be
  going on very nicely."</p>

  <p>Without turning her head toward him, Eleanor addressed Trowse.</p>

  <p>"Will you please tell me something?"</p>

  <p>"If I can."</p>

  <p>"When shall I remember things?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her thoughtfully. She kept her eyes averted, but she seemed
  to be shivering a little.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps to-morrow," he answered. "Perhaps not for a year. It is one of
  those things which science is powerless to determine."</p>

  <p>"But I shall&mdash;remember&mdash;some day?"</p>

  <p>"Some day&mdash;certainly. Let me ask you a question."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Are you very anxious to remember?"</p>

  <p>"It is so puzzling," she answered. "Sometimes I want to very much,
  sometimes I am content."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. As though against her will, she turned her
  head and looked up at him standing over her bedside. Again there was the
  faint shrinking away, again her troubled eyes seemed held by his against her
  will.</p>

  <p>"I will give you some advice, young lady," he said. "Let things go. You
  have made a marvelous recovery. The completion of it is in your own hands.
  Accept the present. If the past eludes you&mdash;let it. You will remember
  this?"</p>

  <p>Eleanor remained speechless, though her lips seemed to move. Every word,
  though easily spoken, seemed to come to her charged with a precise and
  serious meaning. His tone was unemotional, his manner was not even earnest.
  Yet she never forgot. The two men left the room. By common consent, they
  turned into the study. Trowse eyed his friend curiously.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he said, "what the devil made you send for me?"</p>

  <p>Sir Powers Fiske did not immediately reply. The two men stood side by side
  upon the hearthrug. Trowse, who seemed to have forgotten his hurry, lit a
  cigarette and threw the match into the fire.</p>

  <p>"I scarcely see," he said, "where I come in. You have your chance, you
  have taken it, and you have succeeded. Very well! What do you want with me?
  If it had been before the risk was over, I could have understood it. At
  present I must admit that I cannot."</p>

  <p>Powers answered as one who makes a confession.</p>

  <p>"I have lost my nerve," he said.</p>

  <p>Trowse looked at him oddly.</p>

  <p>"I might believe that of some men," he said, "not of you. Besides, the
  risk is over. The girl will live. You know that as well as I do."</p>

  <p>"She will live," Powers answered, "yes! That is certain. And yet, since
  she opened her eyes, since I heard her speak, I have felt myself nothing less
  than a murderer. That is what I am. A murderer, Trowse."</p>

  <p>Trowse stared at his friend for several moments without speaking&mdash;a
  cold, deliberate inspection. Then he sighed.</p>

  <p>"You are not the man you were, Powers," he said, speaking softly, and as
  though to himself. "It isn't drink, and you don't smoke much. What has
  happened to your nerves?"</p>

  <p>Powers looked steadfastly and gloomily out of the window.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you," he answered. "You know me better than most men,
  Trowse. You have never seen me turn a hair at any operation yet. Together we
  have watched death come to strong men and to beautiful women. These things
  have never troubled me. I have never felt anything more than curiosity. Yet
  there is a weak spot somewhere. I have learned what fear is."</p>

  <p>Trowse eyed his friend with interest.</p>

  <p>"If the girl were dead," he remarked meditatively, "it might have turned
  out awkwardly for you. As it is, you seem to have stumbled across a very
  nearly perfect physical creature. She is less likely to die than you or I. In
  a fortnight she will be recovered."</p>

  <p>Powers frowned impatiently.</p>

  <p>"You have not made a study of this thing as I have, Trowse," he said.
  "Yours is the purely scientific point of view. You do not see&mdash;what lies
  beyond."</p>

  <p>Trowse shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I do not understand you," he said simply.</p>

  <p>"I want you to understand," Powers declared. "We have talked of this thing
  many times, until it has grown to seem a simple thing. We forgot!"</p>

  <p>"Forgot what?"</p>

  <p>"Forgot that the continuity of life, after all, is purely physical.
  Behind&mdash;there is a woman slain&mdash;up there a woman created."</p>

  <p>Trowse, for a moment, was bewildered. A searching glance into the other's
  face showed him that Powers was in earnest. He became contemplative.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure that I understand you, Powers," he said slowly. "In fact, I
  am sure that I do not. We have watched operations together, when, to our
  certain knowledge, the knife has gone a little deeper, has gone a little more
  to the left or right, in order that some addition might be made to the sum of
  human knowledge. You have never blenched. We have seen men die whose lives
  might have been prolonged, if not altogether spared, that the race to come
  might benefit. Tacitly, you and I have always recognized the principle that
  the individual must be the servant of humanity. Therefore, as I say, I do not
  understand your present attitude."</p>

  <p>"I am not sure, Trowse, that I can make you understand," Powers answered.
  "Only remember this: Our point of view is probably not the same. You are a
  materialist pure and simple. I am not!"</p>

  <p>"Proceed!"</p>

  <p>"In the cases which you have mentioned it is the body only which has
  suffered. In this case, the body has survived, but something else&mdash;has
  been destroyed. You know the danger which still exists."</p>

  <p>Trowse nodded.</p>

  <p>"Lunacy! That, of course, is a possibility."</p>

  <p>Powers shivered slightly.</p>

  <p>"It is a possibility," he admitted. "Even if she remains sane, will you
  tell me this? What connection can there be between the mind of the girl of a
  month ago and the woman of a month to come?"</p>

  <p>"It is an interesting psychological problem," Trowse answered, "which we
  shall know more about shortly. I must admit, though, that your position is
  inexplicable to me. Fortune has given you a marvelous opportunity. I cannot
  conceive how you could have acted differently. I cannot understand your
  present hesitation. If you wish for any sort of cooperation on my part, tell
  me how you first met this young woman, and under what circumstances you
  persuaded her to become your patient."</p>

  <p>In a few words Powers told him.</p>

  <p>There was a short silence. Trowse was regarding his friend with cold
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"All that you tell me," he said, "makes your present hesitation the more
  extraordinary. Your scruples are unworthy of you. They would be unworthy of
  you even if you belonged to that sickly order of sentimentalists who would
  shrink from killing a poisonous snake because the reptile had been given
  life. According to your own showing, the girl was in an intolerable position.
  She enters upon her new life with every prospect of happiness. Believe me,
  Powers, the hand which struck away the bridge between her past and future was
  the hand of a benefactor."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you must be right," Powers murmured.</p>

  <p>"Right! It is hopelessly obvious," Trowse answered. "If this hesitation is
  anything more than a passing mood with you, I shall be amazed. You probably
  saved the girl from moral shipwreck&mdash;you have transported her into a
  life which she could certainly never have reached by any other means!"</p>

  <p>In his tone and in his face were signs of a rare and intense enthusiasm.
  The eyes of the two men met. Trowse continued, with a gesture stiff, but
  almost dramatic:</p>

  <p>"Man, it is wonderful! I could kill you as you stand there, for envy. It
  is among the possibilities that you, a dilettante, a dabbler, may solve the
  secret of all the ages past and to come. It may be that she will sing to you
  the songs that Pocahontas sang to the great god of the Indians or you may
  wake in the night to hear the wail of one of those daughters of Judah led
  captive into Egypt. Perhaps she was a priestess in the time-forgotten cities
  of Africa, gone before our history crept into being, swept who knows where
  off the face of the earth!"</p>

  <p>Powers was shaking with excitement. This sudden eloquence from the one man
  on earth whose cold self-restraint had become a byword moved him
  strangely.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "for good or for evil, the thing must go through as it
  has been arranged. I am glad that you are interested, Trowse. It may be that
  I shall need your help."</p>

  <p>"Likely enough," Trowse answered shortly. "It seems to me that you have
  let go some of the old ideas. Believe me, they were the safest. The man who
  has work to do in the world has no greater enemy than this shifting
  sentimentalism. May I come and see your patient to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"You may see her as often as you like," Powers answered, "so long as you
  let me know beforehand that you are coming."</p>

  <p>"I thank you," Trowse answered, with a cold smile. "You need have no fear
  that I shall attempt any single-handed experiments. Only, if you want my
  advice, don't give her over to society, no matter what your promise was. Why
  on earth don't you keep her quietly to yourself here instead of sending her
  to her mother? What do you want to go publishing her to the world at all for?
  A thousand things may happen if you carry out this hairbrained scheme of
  yours. She may even want to marry. She is good-looking enough. You might
  easily lose her altogether."</p>

  <p>Powers was suddenly pale. There were, indeed, many possibilities which he
  had not seriously considered. Yet he never hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I must keep my word to her," he said. "I shall do it at all costs."</p>

  <p>"You are a fool," Trowse declared bluntly. "Make her your wife. Bind her
  to you. Make sure of her."</p>

  <p>Powers walked to the door with his visitor.</p>

  <p>"It is useless to argue with you," he said. "We look at the matter from
  different points of view. The girl risked her life to gain a certain end. She
  has won, and she shall have her reward."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">With the passage of the months, Eleanor, little by little,
  entered upon a strange new life in accordance with what had been promised
  her. Through the London social season she went about with Lady Fiske and was
  admired and sought after everywhere. It was as though a magician had touched
  her face, and there had passed away from it all sense of trouble, all evil
  memories, every trace of suffering. The troubled mouth seemed ever ready to
  break into laughter, the faint lines and wrinkles had faded completely away.
  She was years younger. The light of past sorrows had gone from her eyes, they
  remained only the mirror of the brightest and gayest things in life. In her
  youth, her beauty, and her almost assertive <i>joie de vivre</i> she seemed
  like a child among the little company by whom she was constantly surrounded
  wherever she went in her soulless, indefatigable quest for amusement.</p>

  <p>"Are you not afraid, Eleanor, that some day you will grow tired of amusing
  yourself?" Powers asked her one night at a dinner where she had outshone all
  others.</p>

  <p>A peal of light, sweet laughter rang out above the babel of conversation.
  Everyone looked toward Eleanor's table. She was leaning a little forward in
  her chair, her lips parted, her cheeks flushed, her eyes alight with
  enjoyment. A single row of pearls encircled her long, graceful neck, her
  shoulders and bare arms were dazzlingly soft, her hair gleamed in the shaded
  lamplight.</p>

  <p>"No! Why on earth should I? What else is there to do?"</p>

  <p>"What about amusing other people sometimes&mdash;by way of change?"</p>

  <p>She smiled delightfully.</p>

  <p>"How dull! I suppose you mean have a night class for boys, or get up
  concerts to send ragged children to the seaside."</p>

  <p>"Why not? Such things are kindly enough; they do good! They are excellent
  things for a girl to interest herself in."</p>

  <p>"But it wouldn't amuse me at all, Powers! I should be bored to death."</p>

  <p>"And you are going to think of nothing but amusing yourself all your
  life?" he asked slowly.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she answered lightly.</p>

  <p>Powers turned his face away in quick vexation, to encounter his mother's
  disapproving glance focused on Eleanor from a near-by table.</p>

  <p>For Lady Fiske, ever ready to further her son's scientific projects, had
  lent the girl her social patronage, and had tried to blind herself to the
  arrant selfishness and inconsideration that she everywhere encountered in
  their intercourse. Between Eleanor and Powers' sister Marian there was almost
  less in common, for the Eleanor of a month ago had ceased to exist.
  Beautiful, brilliant, hard, she flitted like a butterfly through the world
  that Powers had promised her, beating her wings in a mad pursuit of amusement
  and pleasure, commanding homage and self-sacrifice with a touch as hard as
  steel.</p>

  <p>Powers breathed a long sigh and there was a careworn look in his eyes as
  he glanced again at the girl in front of him.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately Lady Fiske rose, and the women passed out. Trowse stood
  back among the shadows behind the small table at which he had been sitting,
  and steadfastly watched the girl of whom he and Marian Fiske had been
  talking. Prosperity had indeed had a wonderful effect upon Eleanor's looks.
  The light of perfect health had flushed her delicate cheeks, her figure had
  filled out; she carried herself with a grace and confidence which took no
  count of those days of slow torture through which she had passed. Yet there
  was about her beauty some faint note of peculiarity which had puzzled others
  before Trowse. He asked himself what it was as she passed out, a queen
  running the gantlet of a court of admiring eyes, fresh, exquisitely natural,
  the living embodiment of light-hearted gaiety. When at last the door was
  closed and the men drew nearer together, he smiled quietly to himself.</p>

  <p>"It is like one of those pictures," he murmured, "which come near to
  breaking the heart of the painter. It is perfect in color and form, it is
  beautiful&mdash;and yet it does not live. There is no background."</p>

  <p>He moved to a table nearer the center of the room from which he could
  watch his host. The heavily shaded lights were kind enough to the faces of
  the men who sat laughing together over their cigarettes, but Trowse was a
  keen watcher, and he saw things which were hardly apparent to a casual
  observer. Powers had altered during the last few months. There were curious
  lines about his mouth, his eyes were a little sunken, his geniality was a
  trifle forced. Trowse smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"Conscience!" he muttered to himself. "Powers was never quite free from
  the sentimentalities of life. What a fool to trifle with such an
  opportunity!"</p>

  <p>He waited for his chance, and moved up presently to his host's table.
  Powers welcomed him, but without heartiness. It happened that for the moment
  the two were virtually isolated. Trowse leaned over toward the other.</p>

  <p>"How does the great experiment go?" he asked, in a low tone.</p>

  <p>Powers visibly flinched. He glanced around him nervously.</p>

  <p>"I want to talk to you about her, Trowse," he said. "I can't expect your
  sympathy, and you can't help me&mdash;you nor any other man. But I've got to
  talk to some one&mdash;or go mad."</p>

  <p>Trowse nodded with the air of a Sphinx. "Well?"</p>

  <p>"She is so horribly changed," Powers said. "Can't you see it? Of course
  you can't judge because you did not know her before. Trowse, I feel like a
  man who has created a monster, who has breathed life into some evil thing and
  let it loose upon the world."</p>

  <p>Trowse smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"Personally," he said, "I admit that I am no judge. I understand, however,
  that society in general scarcely takes the same view of Miss Hardinge. Isn't
  she supposed to be rather a beauty?"</p>

  <p>Powers beat impatiently with his hand upon the table.</p>

  <p>"You know that I am not talking about her looks. She's beautiful enough to
  bewitch every man who comes near her&mdash;and she does it."</p>

  <p>"It must be a little inconvenient for you," Trowse remarked. "Beyond that,
  I scarcely see your point."</p>

  <p>"Man, you have eyes," Powers exclaimed, with subdued passion. "I have seen
  you studying her closely when you fancied yourself undisturbed. You can see
  what I see. She is like a marvelous piece of mechanism. The working of it is
  perfect, but it isn't human. She is ready to be amused at anything; she is
  never serious for a single moment. She is only alive upon the sensuous side.
  Confound it, Trowse, don't look at me like that. She has no soul. There is
  nothing alight inside."</p>

  <p>Trowse broke the short silence.</p>

  <p>"I am to take it, then," he said coldly, "that you abandon the experiment.
  In your present condition it is, I suppose, inevitable. You have lost all
  influence over her. It would be hopeless to expect her to respond to your
  will."</p>

  <p>"I have already abandoned it," Powers answered. "I curse the day and the
  thought which made me ever attempt it."</p>

  <p>"It is as well, then," Trowse answered, "to give you fair warning. I do
  not propose to stand by quietly and watch your folly."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Powers demanded.</p>

  <p>"This: That if you do not carry this thing through&mdash;I shall!"</p>

  <p>Powers sprang to his feet, his face was dark with passion.</p>

  <p>"If you should dare to interfere," he cried, "if you should make the
  slightest attempt to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>The monosyllable came like a pistol-shot, incisive, compelling! There was
  a breathless silence. Trowse continued, and his words were cold and hard.</p>

  <p>"Do not threaten me," he said. "You should know better than that. You
  should know exactly of how much account I hold my life when it comes to a
  question of adding to the sum of human knowledge. I shall do as I say. My
  decision is unalterable."</p>

  <p>Powers was a man again.</p>

  <p>"It is well to be prepared," he said. "I thank you for your warning. Take
  mine in return. I have as little fear of death as you, and I think that my
  love for Eleanor is a passion as strong as your devotion to science. I tell
  you that I will not have her made the subject of your experiments. I will not
  have her life or reason imperiled, even to solve the greatest of all
  mysteries."</p>

  <p>Trowse shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "that we understand one another perfectly."</p>

  <p>Their talk fanned a growing distrust of Trowse that Fiske had felt for
  weeks. He knew the man's hypnotic power, he saw the fascination with which
  his friend haunted Eleanor's side at gatherings where her clear bright laugh
  would suddenly cease and a look almost of terror creep into her eyes with
  Trowse's entrance. Then she forgot every one else and yielded herself to his
  spell.</p>

  <p>Very subtly, very deftly, Trowse pursued his cold-blooded course of
  experiment while Powers in vain sought to end it. At last he forbade Trowse
  to enter his home and all went well until returning one day, at an unexpected
  hour, Powers heard from his library ringing through the house, through closed
  doors and curtained hallways, the cry of a woman in mortal fear.</p>

  <p>He sprang to the door and threw it open. Outside all was silent. There was
  no repetition of the cry. Then a fainter sound reached him&mdash;a low,
  convulsive moaning as of some creature in pain. He crossed the hall, ran
  wildly down a long passage, and flung open the door of the little
  sitting-room which had been given to Eleanor for her own. With his foot upon
  the threshold he paused for a second. He heard stealthy movements in the
  hall, the front door softly opened and shut. On the floor before him, white
  and motionless, Eleanor was lying.</p>

  <p>He knew that this was Trowse's work; he ran to the front door with murder
  in his heart but there was no sight of anyone. Marian, too, from the drawing
  room had heard the door close softly.</p>

  <p>Powers sat with Eleanor's hand in his, watching for her return to
  consciousness. Her fingers lay in his, cold and passive, her hair was in wild
  disorder, and her face was still deadly pale. He bent over the closed eyes,
  and a fierce, passionate desire crept into his heart. If only she might wake
  up as he had known her first. If only these terrible months of her second
  existence might be blotted out forever. He was content to have failed in his
  great experiment. He had no longer any ambition to add to the sum of human
  knowledge. The memory of Halkar and his patients had become a nightmare to
  him. Forever he would have been content to remain ignorant of those things
  which lay now so short a distance beyond. It was an unexpected lesson which
  he had learned, a strange fever which had wrought so marvelous a
  transformation in him. The old ideals were dead and buried, life itself had
  become centered around the girl who lay by his side now, white and
  inanimate.</p>

  <p>At last with a little shiver she opened her eyes.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Physically, Eleanor became at that time a puzzle both to
  Powers and to the physician whom he called in to attend upon her. From an
  almost animal perfection of health, she passed after her recovery from that
  prolonged fainting fit into a state of nervous prostration, the more
  remarkable from its contrast to her former robustness. She lost her color,
  her light gracefulness of movement, her brilliant gaiety of manner. She moved
  about listlessly, with pallid cheeks, and always with a strange gleam in her
  eyes&mdash;of expectancy, mingled with apprehension.</p>

  <p>"It is so absurd&mdash;so horrible&mdash;to look back&mdash;and to
  remember nothing," she said one day, with a little break in her voice. "I
  want to see some one who really belongs to me&mdash;my father, or my uncle,
  or some one. Perhaps that would help me&mdash;to remember."</p>

  <p>"My dear," Powers said, "I am afraid that you would never be able to find
  your father. He is in China on a secret mission for the Government. That is
  why he cannot write or receive letters. You must be content with us for a
  little longer. We may hear from your uncle any day."</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence. In her face were traces of a strange new
  nervousness.</p>

  <p>"If I could get away&mdash;a long distance away!" Eleanor exclaimed, with
  a sudden tremulous emotion. "If only I could."</p>

  <p>Powers took one of her restless hands in his.</p>

  <p>"Eleanor," he said, "we have been talking about taking you to a little
  place we have in Lincolnshire, close to the sea. There will be only Marian
  and I. You shall be alone as much as you choose. No one shall come near you
  whom you do not care to see."</p>

  <p>She looked at him almost wistfully.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow!" she repeated.</p>

  <p>They left London early the next morning and Eleanor, with a face that was
  almost haggard leaned wearily back in the train and scarcely spoke during the
  entire trip.</p>

  <p>Toward the end of dinner, on the evening of their arrival, Powers threw
  open the French windows and let in the deep music of the sea. She started to
  her feet with a strange little cry.</p>

  <p>"Hark!"</p>

  <p>It was the first sign of her awakening interest in life.</p>

  <p>"The tide is coming in," Powers said. "You see the beach is just below the
  gardens."</p>

  <p>She stepped through the window and crossed the lawn. From there a winding
  path led down to the beach. She never paused until she stood upon the
  shingle, with her pale, rapt face turned seaward. Powers followed noiselessly
  close behind. Almost to their feet, the long waves came thundering in, weird
  and ghostlike. She stood like a statue, her lips parted, her bosom rising and
  falling quickly under her dinner-gown.</p>

  <p>"Listen," she murmured, "it is the old cry, unending, everlasting. Where
  have I heard it before? Oh, tell me! Tell me!"</p>

  <p>"I cannot," he answered. "I would that I could!"</p>

  <p>She paid no more attention to him. She stood with her face turned seaward,
  listening&mdash;always listening. He went back to the house and brought
  wraps. She let him adjust them without thanks or remark. Soon the gathering
  darkness blotted out everything except the faint phosphorescent light on the
  tops of the breaking waves.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said at last, touching her arm gently, "it is late, and we have
  left Marian alone."</p>

  <p>She did not move, but soon Marian came out and called to them. Then she
  permitted him to lead her slowly toward the house, pausing every now and then
  to listen. A faint moon was shining through a misty sky, and he caught a
  glimpse of her face, which startled him. It was as though she were listening
  to voices which he could not hear. There was the breath of another world
  about her.</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid of being dull here?" he asked. "You see, we have no
  neighbors, and the village is a mile away."</p>

  <p>She smiled curiously.</p>

  <p>"There is never any dullness," she said, "where that is!"</p>

  <p>He was prepared for changes in her, but this sudden transition from a
  materialism almost gross was staggering. It was only a few weeks ago that he
  had watched in vain for a single sign of feeling in her face. Now she was
  pale almost to the lips with emotion.</p>

  <p>The next afternoon she called to him. He sprang up and found her standing
  in the open window dressed for walking. Even in his first rapid glance he saw
  a wonderful change in her appearance. Her cheeks were flushed, and her eyes
  bright. Once more she carried herself with the old lightsome grace. She
  called to him gaily.</p>

  <p>"Come for a walk, Powers! I am going to take you somewhere."</p>

  <p>He caught up his stick and hat, and followed her. Then he saw that the
  color in her cheeks was not wholly natural. She was nervous and excited.</p>

  <p>"Why not inland, Eleanor?" he suggested. "Let us go to Turton Woods."</p>

  <p>She seemed scarcely to have heard him. Already she was well on her way
  shoreward.</p>

  <p>He caught her up in a few strides. The tide had gone down, and they walked
  dry-footed along the road. Above their heads the larks were singing, and in
  their faces the freshening sea wind blew.</p>

  <p>Her head was thrown back, her lips were parted. She drank in the breeze as
  though it were wine.</p>

  <p>"This is the wind which Ulric and his men always loved," she murmured. "A
  wind from the north to the shore. Can't you feel the sting of the Iceland
  snows?"</p>

  <p>"Not I?" he answered, laughing. "To me it is soft and warm enough. But
  then, you know, I have no imagination."</p>

  <p>"Powers," she said suddenly, "I want to ask you a question. Is there any
  fear of my going mad?"</p>

  <p>He started violently.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not!" he answered. "Why do you ask me such a question?"</p>

  <p>"I know that I am not like other girls," she said wistfully. "I cannot
  remember my father, or my life in India, or the voyage. When I try to think
  about these things my head plays me such strange tricks. I cannot remember
  where I was, or what I was doing a year ago&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Go on. Tell me exactly how you feel," he said encouragingly. "It will
  help me to put you right."</p>

  <p>"But behind all that," she continued hesitatingly, "I seem to remember
  many strange things&mdash;things which must have happened a long, long time
  ago. They are not things I have been told about, or read of! I can remember
  them. They must have happened to me. Powers, it makes me afraid."</p>

  <p>He looked at her with ill-concealed excitement.</p>

  <p>"It is the sea," she murmured, "which seems always to be reminding me of
  things."</p>

  <p>She came a little closer to him. His heart beat fiercely. Her eyes sought
  his&mdash;the appeal of the weak to the strong. He crushed down his
  joy&mdash;yet it shone in his face, trembled in his tone.</p>

  <p>"Shall I ever be like other girls?"</p>

  <p>He took her hands in his. She yielded them readily, but they were cold as
  ice.</p>

  <p>"I am perfectly sure of it," he declared. "You must trust in me and be
  patient."</p>

  <p>She held his hands tightly as though wrung with a sudden emotion&mdash;an
  emotion which he realized was one of fear alone.</p>

  <p>"Powers," she begged, "will you lock my door at night? Lock all the doors
  in the house."</p>

  <p>"You have been walking in your sleep!" he said. "Tell me about it. You
  must tell me everything, Eleanor, if I am to succeed."</p>

  <p>"Not in my sleep," she answered, in a low tone, "but at night, when
  everything is quiet, the sea calls and calls, and I cannot rest. I woke
  suddenly this morning at three o'clock, and I went out. Powers, as I walked
  and listened, the wind and the sea came to me like old friends. I remembered
  many strange things. I remembered people whose graves the sea has stolen from
  the land ages ago. I was back in those days myself, Powers. I sang their
  songs, my heart beat with their joys."</p>

  <p>Powers was silent. It had come, then, after all&mdash;the great awakening.
  He looked at her with a curiosity almost reverent. His voice trembled.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, of those days," he begged.</p>

  <p>She shook her head impatiently.</p>

  <p>"They came back to me then," she said, "in the twilight, when the whole
  world slept, and only the sea kept calling to me. Now they are blotted out. I
  am afraid to think of them. Powers, help me to forget."</p>

  <p>For a moment his love was in the balance against that unconquerable thirst
  for knowledge which had seemed to him once the whole aim of life. He must
  look, if only for a second, into that land beyond.</p>

  <p>"Eleanor," he said thickly, "tell me what you remembered of those days.
  Sing me that song. You need not be afraid. It is no sign of madness,
  this!"</p>

  <p>She burst into tears, stretched out her hands&mdash;the impulsive gesture
  of a child, and the desire of his life became suddenly a faint thing beside
  his great love of her. He drew her tenderly to him.</p>

  <p>"Eleanor," he whispered, "you know that I love you. Give yourself to me,
  to guard and to keep. You are the first woman who has ever come into my life.
  You will be the last. I will keep you from all harm. I will help you stifle
  those evil memories. You shall be my wife, and I will teach you that love is
  the greatest and the sweetest thing in the world."</p>

  <p>He held her from him and looked anxiously into her face. There was scant
  comfort there for him.</p>

  <p>"When you talk like that," she murmured, "I feel that I must be different
  from all other people. You expect something from me which I know nothing
  about. I do not feel toward you in the least like you say you feel toward me.
  Why is it?"</p>

  <p>"It will come!" he declared confidently. "I am sure of it. In the future
  it must come."</p>

  <p>She moved away and Powers watched her wistfully. She was thinner than he
  had ever known her, and of that wonderful fresh beauty which had taken London
  by storm there remained but few traces. Yet to him there came at that moment
  a wonderful impulse of love. The wistfulness which shone in her eyes, the
  wasted cheeks, the pallor of her once beautiful complexion, seemed in a sense
  to have spiritualized her. The child whose frank sensuousness had horrified
  him seemed to have passed away.</p>

  <p>Once more she was the girl whom he had met on the wet pavement of the
  city, brave and womanly, although in desperate straits&mdash;the woman who,
  however unexpectedly, had first found her way to his heart. Never, even in
  those days when her beauty had been unrivaled, and her train of admirers a
  constant source of embarrassment, had she seemed to him more to be desired
  than at that moment.</p>

  <p>As she walked she began to sing softly and to herself. He wondered at the
  strange chanting tune and at the time-forgotten words. And as she sang the
  color brightened her cheeks, and the wakening breezes blew the hair about her
  face.</p>

  <p>A great sea-bird, disturbed by her voice, rose from the ditch below with a
  flapping of wings and drifted away seaward.</p>

  <p>"It is only a bird," she said. "If you had seen as many of them as I have,
  you would not heed them. I have seen them in droves, when their wings
  darkened the sky, and I have heard them calling to one another down the north
  wind. Where have you lived all your life that you know nothing of these
  things?"</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Come and sit with me on the sand-hill there," she said, "and I will tell
  you about the sea."</p>

  <p>He followed her. Almost to their feet the long waves made harsh music upon
  the shingle.</p>

  <p>"Poor man," she said softly. "Listen, have you never heard this when the
  north wind blows?"</p>

  <p>And again she sang that wonderful song. When her voice died away he shook
  his head.</p>

  <p>"No, I have never heard that," he said. "It is very beautiful. I have
  never heard the music, and I do not know what language it is."</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"It is the song of Ulric, the Dane," she told him. "Many a time he has
  sung it to me as we stood on the prow of his ship, and the spray broke over
  our heads and leaped high into the sunshine. He sang it to me when the cold
  sleet stung our cheeks, and the wind came rushing about us, and we heard no
  longer the swirl of the oars. He sang it to me in the darkness, while we
  stole into the harbor, and below his men sharpened their swords and fitted
  their spear-heads."</p>

  <p>"Who was Ulric?" he asked tentatively.</p>

  <p>"Ulric was my lover," she answered. "Every night, when the tide comes in,
  he calls to me, but I do not know where he is. I do not think that I shall
  ever see him any more."</p>

  <p>"Tell me about him," he begged.</p>

  <p>Her eyes shone.</p>

  <p>"He was tall and strong like a god," she answered, "with yellow hair and
  beard, and wonderful blue eyes. No man save he could wield his sword, and in
  battle men gave way before him as the corn falls before the scythe. And
  because he loved me he brought me here with him from over the seas. I sat in
  the ship, while he and his men fought on the land. And at night, when the
  villages were burning, back came my lover with skins and ornaments, corn and
  wine, and we were all happy together."</p>

  <p>He watched her still with fascinated eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that you remember these things?" he asked. "You have read
  about them in a book."</p>

  <p>"A book!" she exclaimed scornfully. "What need have I of books to tell me
  of these things?&mdash;I, to whom their happening was but as yesterday. Only
  then my name was Hildegarde, and now they call me Eleanor."</p>

  <p>"But this all happened very long ago," he protested. "You are only
  twenty-five, you know. It isn't possible for you to remember."</p>

  <p>She eyed him with tolerant scorn.</p>

  <p>"You foolish man!" she exclaimed. "You do not understand. The days when I
  was Hildegarde, and Ulric was my lover, are as clear to me as moonlight. I
  could tell you many things of those days if you cared to listen&mdash;how
  Ulric slew his brother because he lifted his eyes to me, and how once we were
  both taken prisoners by the King of East Mercia, and Ulric burst his bonds,
  the strongest they could forge, and slew the guards one by one.</p>

  <p>"It was just such a dawn as this when we came running to the seashore, and
  when we smelled the salt wind how we laughed in one another's faces for the
  joy of our freedom. Behind the Britons were staggering with fatigue&mdash;for
  Ulric ran like a god, and when I was weary he caught me up by the waist, and
  I lay upon his shoulder, and never troubled him. Or I could tell you how he
  slew his chief captain because one night he whispered in my ear."</p>

  <p>He clasped her fingers in his. They were hot and feverish.</p>

  <p>"Shall we turn now, dear?" he said. "We have walked far enough in this
  sun. You shall tell me more of Ulric another day."</p>

  <p>They had left the shore, but she turned to the right along a low range of
  sand-hills.</p>

  <p>"Does this lead to any place in particular?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It leads to Rayston Church," she answered. "We are going there."</p>

  <p>He looked at her in quick surprise.</p>

  <p>"How did you know that?" he asked. "I have heard of a place called
  Rayston, but there is no church there."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"I will show you where it stood, then," she answered. "I will show you,
  too, what sort of man Ulric was. It was the last of our raids. We had twelve
  ships, and nearly five hundred men, and everywhere the people fled without
  fighting, for no one could stand against Ulric and his men. For once I, too,
  was allowed to land, for we knew that our coming was unexpected, and there
  was no fear of defeat. Village by village they plundered, and sacked, and
  burned. Night by night we made great fires, by which the ships followed us
  along the coast, and I sang to them till the embers burned low."</p>

  <p>She stopped short with a little cry, and pointed inland. To their left was
  a plowed field, and in the top corner were three grass and ivy-covered stone
  walls of immense thickness.</p>

  <p>"See," she cried, "there stood Rayston Church! When we came here an old
  man met us waving a green bough. He told Ulric that all the folk had fled,
  and that their dwellings might be spared they had collected all their
  treasures and belongings and stored them in the church. Ulric believed him,
  and they hastened to the church, all shouting and singing together for joy of
  such an easy victory. But when they were within a dozen yards of the building
  there came suddenly upon them from the slit apertures and the tower a cloud
  of poisoned arrows, and Ulric lost more men in those few minutes than ever in
  his life before. I was far away behind, but I saw all. I saw Ulric raise his
  great two-edged sword and cut down to the ground the old man who had led them
  there. I saw them drag the trunk of a tree to the church door and batter it
  in, and not one Briton escaped. Ask that old man, Powers, what they have
  found in the fields here."</p>

  <p>Powers called a laborer digging on a potato-patch close at hand.</p>

  <p>"What is the name of that ruin?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The man surveyed it doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"There ain't any one as rightly knows, sir," he admitted. "Our vicar has
  looked at the walls, and reckoned it must have been a church."</p>

  <p>"Have any Danish trophies ever been found about here?"</p>

  <p>The old man smiled.</p>

  <p>"You see this field, sir?" he answered. "I've heard my grandfather say
  that when he used to plow that one day it must have been sown with human
  bones. There's an old horn mug been found here, too, that they say, from the
  shape of it, must have belonged to some foreigners. It's in the British
  Museum in London."</p>

  <p>Powers threw him a shilling and turned away with Eleanor.</p>

  <p>"You have been here before," he said, in a low tone.</p>

  <p>"Never since I came with Ulric," she answered dreamily, "and that must
  have been a very, very long time ago. There were no houses in those days, nor
  any fields. Yet the land is the same, the land and the sea. They do not
  change."</p>

  <p>They sat down on a sandy knoll. Powers took her hand in his.</p>

  <p>"Dear," he said softly, "it is not well for you to dwell upon these
  fancies. Try and think instead of the future&mdash;our future.</p>

  <p>"Fancies," she repeated scornfully. "They are not fancies. They are
  memories."</p>

  <p>"Call them what you will, dear," he said, "but let them lie. They belong
  to a dead past. It is the future which concerns us."</p>

  <p>She drew a little closer to him. For the first time he felt his pressure
  upon her fingers returned.</p>

  <p>It seemed to him as she sat there, with quivering lips, that it was indeed
  the weary shop-girl of the Edgware Road who was with him once more. There was
  a light in her eyes as of some new understanding.</p>

  <p>A great yearning swept over Powers with the memory of that rain-swept,
  wind-tossed bay. All the scientific aspirations, the quiet culture, and the
  easy, pleasant days of sybaritical studentship which had filled his life were
  suddenly things of the past. His passionate love for Eleanor was predominant.
  He was like a man afflicted with a strange fever of unknown origin, which no
  physician could prescribe for, and which he himself was powerless to
  resist.</p>

  <p>In his room that night he sat under his student's lamp into the small
  hours, writing&mdash;writing....</p>

  <p>It was the last chance and he was going to stake his all upon it. He was
  appealing to the old German professor of his student days, the man who more
  than any other could aid him at this time.</p>

  <p>A week later he took Eleanor back to London and placed her in the great
  specialist's hands. And then followed weary days and nights of anxious
  waiting when all but hope seemed fled. Then came a day when his library door
  opened softly and the great German doctor looked at Powers benevolently
  through his double glasses.</p>

  <p>"My young friend," he said, "the work is finished. My last visit to this
  most interesting of patients has been paid. I await now only the confirmation
  of our theories."</p>

  <p>Powers, though outwardly cool, was trembling with excitement.</p>

  <p>"I can go to her?" he asked. "You recommend it? The moment has
  arrived?"</p>

  <p>"It has arrived," Herr Rauchen affirmed. "She is strong enough to bear
  your presence&mdash;to talk in moderation. I will await here the result. It
  is an experiment the most interesting of any I have ever known."</p>

  <p>Powers moved toward the door, but the professor called him back.</p>

  <p>"My young friend," he said, "one moment. There's no hurry. I would ask a
  question."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"You say the room is the same, the nurse is the same. Good! Have you the
  clothes she arrived in?"</p>

  <p>"They are there in full view," Powers answered. "She has come back to
  consciousness among precisely the same surroundings as when she first came to
  me eight months ago."</p>

  <p>"Very good indeed," the professor declared. "Now you shall go to her.
  Meanwhile, I wait for you here."</p>

  <p>Once more Powers hesitated, with his foot upon the threshold of her room.
  It seemed so short a time ago since he stood there before on his way to his
  first interview with her since his great experiment. But his interest was no
  longer scientific. He knew very well that the next few minutes must make or
  mar his life.</p>

  <p>The professor had given him hope; their theories had been based upon a
  sound basis. But the issue was the greatest he had ever put to the test. With
  it was bound up the whole welfare of the woman he loved. He entered the room
  without his usual confidence. Yet the moment he saw her his heart beat with
  passionate hope.</p>

  <p>She was lying upon a sofa, her hair loosely coiled upon the top of her
  head, clad in a becoming morning wrap, white with streaming ribbons. At the
  sound of the opening door she turned her head, and she greeted him with a
  faint smile. As their eyes met he felt once more that passionate thrill of
  hope. For the change in her face was manifest. This was neither the
  brilliantly beautiful but soulless child who had taken London by storm, nor
  the mystic, moody girl, hovering ever on the brink of insanity, who had sung
  to him upon the seashore. It was the Eleanor of his earlier knowledge, who
  greeted him now half-shyly, yet with a certain mischievous look in her clear
  soft eyes.</p>

  <p>"So, after all," she murmured, looking up at him, "I am a disappointment.
  The great experiment is a failure. I really haven't forgotten a single
  thing."</p>

  <p>"Hang the experiment!" he declared cheerfully. "I lost all interest in
  that long ago. All that I have been anxious for has been your recovery."</p>

  <p>"I am so glad," she said. "I was afraid you would be terribly
  disappointed. It really isn't my fault, is it?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," he assured her heartily. "You were an excellent
  subject. I suppose," he added, struggling to keep the anxiety out of his
  tone, "there is no doubt about the failure of it?"</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest. My memory feels particularly clear. You can
  cross-examine me if you like."</p>

  <p>"Well, I will ask you a few questions," he said. "Tell me your last
  recollection before you came to yourself."</p>

  <p>She answered him readily.</p>

  <p>"I came to you here," she said, "and told you that I was dismissed from
  Bearmain's. I heard your proposals and agreed to them. You sent for a nurse
  and you gave me chloroform here. The very last thing in my mind is that you
  walked to the window, and looked at your watch just before I went off."</p>

  <p>He drew a quick breath&mdash;it sounded almost a gasp. "It is wonderful!"
  he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Everything before that day&mdash;my miserable life at Bearmain's, your
  kindness to me, and our little jaunts together," she said, "I can remember
  quite clearly. I am sorry to wound your vanity, but your experiment has been
  shockingly unsuccessful."</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"It was a very foolish one," he declared. "I have been terribly worried
  about you."</p>

  <p>Their eyes met for a moment, and a spot of color burned in her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"You need not have worried," she said softly. "You made it all quite clear
  to me before I consented. I knew the risk I ran."</p>

  <p>He braced himself up for the final test.</p>

  <p>"You have been unconscious for a very long time," he said. "Often I used
  to listen to you talking to yourself. You don't mind, do you? You see it was
  part of the experiment."</p>

  <p>"Of course not," she answered. "Was I very foolish?"</p>

  <p>"You spoke of a lot of things which, of course, I did not understand," he
  said. "For instance, there was Ulric. Who was he?"</p>

  <p>"Ulric?" she repeated the name wonderingly. There was no comprehension in
  her face.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure of the name?" she asked. "I never heard it in my life
  before."</p>

  <p>He smothered his agitation with a strange laugh.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he suggested, "Ulric was one of your companions when you were a
  child."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," she assented. "Yet the name is so uncommon that I think I
  should have remembered it."</p>

  <p>"Well," he continued, "there was a person of the name of Trowse&mdash;an
  enemy, I should think, or some one you disliked. What of him?"</p>

  <p>Again the blankness of non-comprehension. She shook her head at him and
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Do you know," she said, "I shall believe soon that it is you who have
  been raving. Trowse! Ulric! I never heard such names in my life. Tell me, was
  there any one else?"</p>

  <p>"You spoke of my mother and sister as though you knew them," he said.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I saw them with you in a box at the theater one night, you know," she
  reminded him.</p>

  <p>He was watching her closely, and permitted himself a little sigh of
  relief. She was looking out of the window at the faint April sunshine which
  was doing its best to brighten the dull afternoon.</p>

  <p>A few days later Powers made his way to her room in the twilight. It was
  easy to see that her recovery was now an assured thing. She was standing by
  the window when he entered, and he fancied for the first time that she
  greeted him a little nervously.</p>

  <p>"Your mother and sister have been to see me, Sir Powers," she said.
  "Wasn't it delightful of them?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know," he answered. "It seems to me a very natural thing
  for them to do. I hope you liked my mother, Eleanor."</p>

  <p>"How could any one help it?" she said simply. "Your sister was very kind,
  too. They spoke as though&mdash;I was to go and stay with
  them&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?" he said.</p>

  <p>She was very nervous under his gaze. All her words took flight with her
  long, carefully planned idea of a livelihood that she had wanted to consult
  him about.</p>

  <p>The feeling in his eyes was unmistakable. A delicate flush stole into her
  cheeks and she closed her eyes. In the strong light he noticed more clearly
  the fragility of her appearance. He rose hastily.</p>

  <p>"Eleanor," he said, "do not think that I expect too much from you now. But
  I love you very dearly, and to-day I ask from you only the right to give you
  my name, so that I may protect you from all evil, whensoever it may come. For
  the rest I am content to wait."</p>

  <p>The hot color burned in her cheeks. She looked at him
  confused&mdash;reproachful.</p>

  <p>"But you never seemed as though you cared at all!" she faltered. "I don't
  understand."</p>

  <p>He caught her to him. His eyes were bright, his face hungry with the love
  of her.</p>

  <p>"Dear!" he cried, "look at me. What does it matter when first I cared for
  you? Look at me now&mdash;listen. I love you, Eleanor! You believe me! You
  must!"</p>

  <p>She laughed as she leaned toward him.</p>

  <p>"It is so easy," she murmured, "to believe when one wants to&mdash;very
  much."</p>
