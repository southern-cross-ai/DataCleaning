     name="book1">BOOK ONE</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="a-1"
     name="a-1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The electric tramcar which connects the manufacturing town
  of Norchester with the least unlovely of its out-lying suburbs came slowly to
  a standstill at its terminus, four miles from the starting point. Those who
  had survived the journey through smoke-hung and grey, crowded streets, the
  more ornate form of ugliness represented by villas and asphalt pavements,
  left their places and dispersed. Foremost amongst them, three&mdash;a girl
  and two young men, who had travelled the greater part of the distance in
  absolute silence&mdash;descended from the top with eager footsteps, left the
  main road at once, and walked steadily along a passably rural lane towards a
  ridge of fields, rising to a height of a hundred feet or so, and crowned on
  the summit by a thickly growing plantation of pine trees. They had almost the
  air of pilgrims, both in the absorbed quality of their silence, which
  continued for long after they had commenced their walk, and in the definite
  purpose which they evidently had in view. It was not until they had left the
  lane, had passed through a gate and were climbing the path which led through
  the last few meadows to their goal, that any of them attempted speech.</p>

  <p>"At last!" the girl murmured, taking off her hat and carrying it. "What a
  week!"</p>

  <p>"Hellish!" the tall, thin boy walking by her side agreed.</p>

  <p>"Like all the others," the most ordinary-looking of the three&mdash;a
  broad-shouldered, square-faced youth who brought up the
  rear&mdash;muttered.</p>

  <p>Their efforts at conversation seemed temporarily expended&mdash;or perhaps
  the exertion of climbing the last hundred yards of the hill kept them a
  little breathless. The girl, as they drew nearer the stretch of wood towards
  which they were bound, moved her head from side to side as though asking for
  the caress of the west wind, which came to them now with a sweeter and
  fresher quality. Her companion paused to tear a little cluster of wild roses
  from the hedge. The girl accepted them, looked into the petals for a moment
  and then flung them to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Smuts!" she exclaimed. "Even the flowers are blackened! One can't escape,
  even here, from the filth of that hateful town."</p>

  <p>The young man looked down regretfully at the blossom which her foot had
  crushed.</p>

  <p>"The flower itself was exquisite," he remonstrated.</p>

  <p>The girl, in her eager bitterness, ceased for a moment to be
  beautiful.</p>

  <p>"I am unjust," she admitted, "but that is because the smuts are settling
  upon me. A year or two more of this place and I shall be like those wild
  roses&mdash;and I hate the thought!"</p>

  <p>They reached their destination, more breathless than ever now, but, so far
  as the first two were concerned, with an eagerness which seemed
  incomprehensible. They entered the wood through a gate and passed along a
  path strewn and sodden with pine needles, soft to the feet and fragrant. All
  around them, between the bare, straight fronts of the thickly planted trees,
  they caught little glimpses of the promised land beyond&mdash;a real expanse
  of meadows, cornfields and wooded glades. On the far horizon, it is true,
  stretched the scars of a smoke-hung town, and, on their left, factory
  chimneys here and there marred the landscape. But when they skirted the
  outside of the plantation and reached its westward corner, there was nothing
  within the range of their vision but the cornfield sloping down towards the
  valley, a stretch of meadowland, a steep rise, and, beyond, a rolling waste
  of moorland, starred with yellow gorse, faintly pink in sheltered places with
  the promise of the early bell heather. For the first time, all disfiguring
  traces of untoward industrial efforts were absent.</p>

  <p>The girl flung herself down on the ground with something which sounded
  almost like a sob of relief, her arms outstretched, her eyes searching the
  blue skies. The younger of her two companions followed her example, sharing
  apparently to the full the emotion with which she welcomed this change of
  surroundings. The third person in the pilgrimage proceeded to make himself
  comfortable in more leisurely fashion. He chose a place with his back to a
  tree, produced a cheap briar pipe, and deliberately filled it with tobacco of
  unprepossessing appearance. His very performance of the action was typical.
  He was slow but thorough; his square-tipped, capable fingers pressed the
  tobacco skilfully into its appointed place; the few shreds which remained in
  his hand he emptied carefully back into the pouch, which he restored to his
  pocket. As soon as he had commenced to smoke, he broke the silence.</p>

  <p>"Well," he began, "now that you two have dragged me up here, let's hear
  what you have to say."</p>

  <p>The girl by his side half opened her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," she murmured. "I want to listen."</p>

  <p>The young man withdrew his pipe from his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Listen to what?" he asked. "I can't hear anything particular."</p>

  <p>The long-limbed youth on the other side of the girl, who had been lying
  flat on his back in the sunshine, turned over towards his two companions and
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"My dear Matthew," he said, speaking with a natural but not unpleasant
  drawl, which seemed somehow out of keeping with his ready-made clothes and
  clumsy boots, "of course you can hear nothing particular, but that is because
  your ear is not attuned to the music of the world. Rosina is listening to the
  wind amongst the corn tops there. Can't you hear it rustling and whispering
  all the way across from that cluster of poppies, and high up in the tree tops
  above your head, too&mdash;a more melancholy note there, perhaps, but still
  music?"</p>

  <p>"Is it!" the young man named Matthew replied shortly. "I prefer a
  gramophone. And, anyhow, we didn't come out here to listen&mdash;we came to
  talk. If Rosina wants to rest, you go ahead, Philip. Tell me what it is that
  you two have been putting your heads together about."</p>

  <p>"In a moment," the other assented drowsily. "If sounds do not attract you,
  what about scents? All the week I have worked with the poisonous smell of
  leather and of oil in my nostrils. Just now I am perfectly sure that we are
  near some wild sweetbriar. Put your head down, Matthew, and smell the earth
  itself. There's something rich about it, like sunwarmed herbs. There's sap,
  too, bursting out from the trunk of the pine tree against which you are
  leaning. Not even that foul tobacco which you are smoking&mdash;thank heavens
  the breeze is the other way!&mdash;can poison this atmosphere."</p>

  <p>"It is very good tobacco," Matthew replied stolidly. "It is strong, I
  know, but it is very cheap, and, being strong, one does not desire to smoke
  so much of it."</p>

  <p>"There is not the slightest doubt but that some day you will be a
  millionaire," Philip declared.</p>

  <p>"I intend to be," was the calm rejoinder.</p>

  <p>"Any further ambitions?" Rosina asked, opening her very beautiful hazel
  eyes for a moment.</p>

  <p>"What others could there be?" Matthew demanded. "The only choice in life
  seems to me to be the means by which one can make money."</p>

  <p>Philip sighed gently.</p>

  <p>"And this youth," he murmured,&mdash;"I beg his pardon, I forgot that he
  was twenty-four to-day&mdash;has been our companion for eleven years!"</p>

  <p>Matthew raised himself a little, sitting with his knees drawn up and his
  hands clasped around them. His face, with its massive chin and broad
  forehead, had its good points, but his eyes were too close together and his
  lips acquisitive. The dominant and redeeming quality of his expression was
  its forcefulness.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "you two seem to think yourselves very superior
  because you read poetry and go to concerts whilst I learn shorthand and
  typewriting and attend technical schools. Yet, if either of you were to ask
  yourselves a plain question and answer it truthfully, you would discover that
  you wanted pretty well what I want out of life. Philip wants to write
  stories. Well, the measure of his success will be how much, if anything,
  they'll pay him for them. Art has an exact and commercial value, and that
  value can be written down in pounds, shillings and pence. And Rosina here
  wants beautiful clothes, silks to drape about her body, pearls to hang upon
  her neck, and <i>carte blanche</i> at Cook's to buy tickets for every corner
  of the world. What does that all mean except pounds, shillings and pence? I
  go the short way about it, and you two prefer the twisting paths. You'll
  probably get into a maze, you won't know where you are, you'll confuse the
  end with the means, and you'll forget what you started out for. That's why I
  like my way best. I'm not out to pull any stars down from heaven, or to waste
  time dreaming about them. I'm out for a big banking account, and I'll decide
  afterwards what I'll do with the money, when I've got it."</p>

  <p>The girl looked for a moment distressed. Her eyes were wide open now, her
  forehead a little wrinkled. Something of the momentary peace which had come
  into her face had passed away.</p>

  <p>"Philip and I have never thought ourselves superior," she protested
  gently, "and I know that a great deal of what you say is true, although it
  sounds cruel. It is true that I want beautiful clothes and pearls, and that
  those things mean money, but I also want even more to travel, to live and
  move in beautiful places, to hear beautiful music when I choose, to possess
  the books I want, and have the people I like always near me. What do you want
  your wealth for, Matthew? You must have some idea."</p>

  <p>"Power," he answered shortly.</p>

  <p>"And what use would you make of that power?" Philip asked, with
  interest.</p>

  <p>Matthew pressed down the tobacco in his pipe and smoked stolidly for a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"I should like to fill a great place in the financial world," he replied.
  "I should like to build up an immense business, sell it, buy other people's
  businesses, sell them, and make money on every deal. I should like people to
  point to me in Lombard Street. I should like bank managers to come to me for
  advice and help. I should like to have it in my power to ruin whom I
  chose."</p>

  <p>"It is perfectly clear," Philip declared, with a note of mockery in his
  tone so faint that neither of his companions noticed it, "that our task,
  Rosina, ought to be an easy one. You cannot mount many rungs of the ladder of
  your desire in Norchester, Matthew. We brought you out here this afternoon to
  tell you that Rosina and I intend to leave this place almost at once, and to
  ask you to join us."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going to?" Matthew asked.</p>

  <p>"To London," they answered in one breath.</p>

  <p>"Have you told Uncle Benjamin?"</p>

  <p>"We are going to tell him to-night," Rosina replied. "We thought that if
  you decided to come too, you might help us. You seem to be able to talk to
  Uncle Benjamin better than we do."</p>

  <p>"How much money have you got?" Matthew enquired.</p>

  <p>"Rosina has eighty-five pounds," Philip answered, "and I have about a
  hundred and forty. You will have the hundred pounds that is coming to you
  to-night, and you have probably saved something."</p>

  <p>Matthew very nearly smiled. His Post-Office Savings Bank book had been his
  most treasured possession for the last five years.</p>

  <p>"Nothing to speak of," he declared shortly. "However, enough to put us on
  about level terms. I suppose the three of us could live together cheaper than
  separately. What are your plans?"</p>

  <p>"Philip thought that he might secure a position in some publisher's office
  until he can get some of his stories accepted," Rosina explained. "Very
  likely, if he is a sensible publisher, he will want to publish them himself.
  After that, of course, it will be quite easy."</p>

  <p>"And you?"</p>

  <p>"I shall eventually go on the stage," Rosina announced, "only, as Philip
  thinks I am rather young just yet, I shall probably type his stories and work
  in an office for a little time. It is quite easy to make enough money to live
  on in London, if one is not extravagant."</p>

  <p>"Is it?" Matthew answered laconically.</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. Philip and Rosina watched their companion a
  little anxiously. In a way, although they had lived under the same roof since
  childhood, they were conscious of a certain aloofness between them and him.
  He represented different things. Yet, when it came to breaking away from such
  home as they had possessed, and facing the world under new and strange
  conditions, they felt somehow that there were certain qualities about Matthew
  which engendered confidence. His very self-reliance, his almost arrogant
  belief in himself, were infectious. They had no thought of any actual
  assistance from him. Their only idea was that life was likely to prove more
  easy, and its problems more readily faced, if he were at hand. Matthew,
  smoking stolidly on, and gazing with unseeing eyes towards the distant
  moorland, was weighing the matter slowly in his mind. Were these two likely
  to be an encumbrance to him? He almost smiled at the thought. He knew very
  well that he would never permit any one in life to become that. To break away
  from Norchester alone, at that moment, might have its embarrassments. Their
  leaving would provide him with a reasonable excuse. And then there was
  another thing&mdash;just a feeling&mdash;something he was never likely to
  give way to, or allow to come between himself and his interests, but which
  still, in its bald, unlovely way, existed. He turned his head and suffered
  himself to look at Rosina. She had relapsed for a moment into her old
  position, and was lying on her back, her eyes watching the slow, upward
  flight of a lark already high above the tree tops. She was slim, thin almost,
  with the immaturity of youth, but, although Matthew knew nothing of beauty,
  he saw the promise of her almost perfect young body. He realised that the
  pallor of her cheeks had nothing to do with ill health. He even found
  pleasure in watching the curve of her full but delicate lips, and the specks
  of gold which the sun seemed to find in her crumpled hair. It was a feeling,
  he told himself, which he would never allow to come between him and complete
  success. Yet one must live whilst one climbed the ladder.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he decided, "I will come. We will make a start together, at any
  rate."</p>

  <p>"Good fellow!" Philip exclaimed enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>"Bless you!" Rosina murmured, smiling at him delightfully. "I can't tell
  you how glad I am."</p>

  <p>"When did you think of telling Uncle Benjamin?" Matthew enquired.</p>

  <p>"After supper to-night," Rosina answered. "We don't want to wait another
  day. I have been thinking of escape until I feel absolutely on fire with
  impatience. Fancy, both of you, no more of that horrible Norchester! No more
  walking through those hideous streets and working in that hateful factory! No
  more of those ghastly visits to the tradespeople, with Harriet grumbling at
  everything, trying to beat them down in price until they look as though
  they'd like to ask us to leave the place! No more chapel, no more prayers
  morning and night! Oh, I suppose it's ungrateful, but there never was a
  colder house in this world than Uncle Benjamin's. I don't think the sun has
  ever shone into a single corner of it. If I stayed there much longer, I
  should die."</p>

  <p>Matthew rose slowly to his feet.</p>

  <p>"After supper to-night," he repeated. "Yes, perhaps that would be a good
  time. I was going down to the technical schools. There are some extra classes
  there, but I think I know as much as they can teach me. In half an hour we
  must start for home. I am going for a little walk first."</p>

  <p>Rosina threw herself back once more upon the ground. Her hand went frankly
  out to Philip's, she held his fingers tightly in hers.</p>

  <p>"Come back for us," she begged, "when you think we ought to start. Philip
  and I are going to build palaces."</p>

  <p>Matthew stood looking down at them both for a moment, himself ignored.
  Without a shadow of sensitiveness in his nature, he was dimly aware of the
  spiritual barrier which separated him from these two, his companions in the
  great enterprise of life. He turned on his heel.</p>

  <p>"Palaces in the air!" he muttered, a little scornfully. "You can build
  mine for me in Park Lane."</p>

  <p class="first">There was no man in Norchester more respected or less liked
  than Benjamin Stone. He had built the first factory of its sort in the town,
  and become the pioneer of an industry which now provided employment for the
  greater number of its two hundred thousand inhabitants. He had been mayor
  three times and would have accepted that office again but for the possibility
  of a royal visit. Benjamin Stone did not believe in royalty. He was a devout
  Nonconformist, and an occasional preacher in the chapel which he had built
  and endowed. He was charitable so far as regarded gifts to institutions, an
  abstainer from principle, a widower sixty years of age, whose private life
  was almost absurdly beyond reproach, and his existence would have been even
  more solitary than it was but for the singular accident of having had the
  charge of three young people thrust upon him at different times.</p>

  <p>Matthew Garner was the orphaned stepson of his sister who had died out in
  South Africa. Philip Garth was the son of the only friend he had ever
  possessed, a photographer, unfortunate in business, deserted by his wife, and
  converted to Nonconformity during the last few months of his life. Rosina was
  the daughter of his other sister, who, whilst travelling with a Cook's
  excursion party in France, had committed the amazing indiscretion of falling
  in love with and marrying a French artist. Benjamin treated the affair as a
  bereavement, allowed his sister a hundred a year, and returned all her
  letters unopened until the last one, which came addressed in a strange
  handwriting. Its contents were brief enough. It was dated from a small town
  in the southwest corner of France, and, whatever effect it had upon its
  recipient, he took no one into his confidence:</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Benjamin:</span></p>

  <p class="letter">My husband is dead. They tell me that I am not likely to
  live for more than a week or two. You have allowed us a hundred pounds a year
  to live upon, for which I am grateful. I am sending you Rosina, my daughter.
  It will cost you little more than the hundred a year you will save by my
  death, to provide for her. I have had a hard life and I am glad to leave it.
  Are you as religious as ever?</p>

  <p class="letter">Your sister,<br>
  <span class="smcap">Rose</span>.</p><br>

  <p>Benjamin Stone accepted his three charges, but, whether willingly or not,
  no man knew, for no one was in his confidence. He lived in a red brick villa
  which was built at the same time as the chapel, and which was situated next
  door to it. Both had been constructed on economical lines, and both combined
  the maximum of ugliness with the minimum of comfort. He himself was a big,
  lank man, with large bones but little flesh, a face which looked as though it
  were cut out of granite, cold grey eyes, and black hair only thinly streaked
  with grey. He generally wore a dark suit of pepper and salt mixture, an
  unusually high collar, and an inevitable black bow tie, arranged so that the
  ends neither drooped nor faltered in their task of ornamentation. He had
  bushy eyebrows which seemed to meet in a perpetual frown. His voice was hard
  and clear but almost singularly destitute of any human quality. He ate, drank
  and slept sparingly, he had apparently no pleasures, and his religion was a
  militant one. Occasionally, on Saturday afternoons, he played bowls. Even his
  debtors called him a just man.</p>

  <p>Of his three wards, as they grew up, Benjamin Stone made as much use as
  possible. Philip Garth was his junior clerk, and, as his benefactor did not
  scruple to tell him, the worst he had ever employed. Matthew, who was two
  years older, held a more responsible post in the factory, and, but for living
  in constant conflict with his uncle on matters of administration, might have
  held a very different position. Rosina went to the office in the mornings,
  where she typed a few letters, and assisted her uncle's elderly
  housekeeper-domestic in the afternoons. She could never quite make up her
  mind which portion of her duties she found the more detestable.</p>

  <p>The evening meal at Sion House, which Benjamin Stone had prayerfully
  called his villa, was served, on this particular evening, at seven o'clock,
  half-an-hour earlier than usual, by special orders from the head of the
  house. It was not an elaborate repast, and was accompanied by tea, served in
  an urn, over which Rosina presided. It was partaken of, as usual, almost in
  silence, after which the cloth was cleared by the elderly domestic, assisted
  by Rosina. Every one then resumed his place at the table whilst Benjamin
  Stone read a chapter from the Bible. When he had closed the Book, he knelt
  before the horsehair sofa and prayed. There was nothing fervent about his
  appeal to a Divinity whom he seemed to envisage as a heavenly prototype of
  himself. He prayed that sinners who fully expiated their sins might be
  forgiven, that wrongdoers who made full atonement might be received back into
  the fold. The word "mercy" never once occurred in his discourse. There was a
  geometrical exactness about his suggestions to the Deity, which took no
  account of anything outside the great debit and credit ledger. When he had
  finished, he rose and stood at the end of the table. It was as though he had
  some fore-knowledge of what was to come.</p>

  <p>"Rosina," he said, "and you, Philip, there is a lecture to be given in the
  chapel this evening on 'Moral Probity in Commercial Life.' It is my wish that
  you should both attend. Matthew, I believe, has a class at the technical
  schools."</p>

  <p>Rosina looked at once towards Philip, but Philip, as he was so often to do
  in life, failed her. He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"To-night?" he repeated, a little vaguely.</p>

  <p>"You will do well to be there in half an hour's time," Benjamin Stone
  continued. "Representatives of my household should occupy the front pew. Do
  you hear, Rosina?"</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet. Into the ugly room, with its closely drawn, green
  Venetian blinds, a ray of unwelcomed sunshine found its way between two of
  the slats. It happened to fall upon her face just as she was nerving herself
  for the task. She felt, indeed, something of the spirit of a modern Joan of
  Arc as she spoke the first words of rebellion which had passed her lips for
  many years, spoke them not fearfully but with a strange wonder that fear was
  not there.</p>

  <p>"Uncle," she told him gently, "I am sorry I cannot go to the
  lecture&mdash;I shall be busy packing."</p>

  <p>"Packing?" Benjamin Stone repeated, his eyebrows more than ever
  contracted. "Explain yourself."</p>

  <p>"Philip and I, and Matthew too, I believe," she said, "have made up our
  minds to leave Norchester. I speak for Philip and myself. Matthew knows his
  own mind. We are very grateful to you for having supported us all these
  years, but the time has come when we cannot live here any longer. We are both
  unhappy."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Benjamin Stone demanded.</p>

  <p>"Because we both want things in life which Norchester cannot give us,"
  Rosina went on. "It is very difficult to explain, uncle, and I am not good at
  explaining, but our minds are quite made up. We want to live somewhere and
  work somewhere, where for part of the time, at any rate, we can breathe the
  atmosphere which comes from being surrounded with beautiful things."</p>

  <p>"In what part of the world, may I ask, do you intend to search for this
  atmosphere?" Benjamin Stone enquired, unmoved.</p>

  <p>"In London at first," Rosina told him.</p>

  <p>"Is London more beautiful than Norchester?"</p>

  <p>"It is so difficult to explain," she repeated. "Spiritually, it is. There
  is music there, wonderful pictures to be seen; there is history, association,
  people working with big aims and big ideas, the heart of a great city beating
  in your ears night and day."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone listened with the air of one who seeks to understand. There
  was no anger in his face, there was certainly no sympathy.</p>

  <p>"Our picture gallery here is well supplied," he said. "We have acquired
  works&mdash;at a ridiculous price, in my opinion&mdash;painted by many well-
  known artists. Marshall's concerts are, I believe, found attractive by the
  musical element in the town."</p>

  <p>Rosina made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"I knew that I could not make you understand, uncle," she sighed. "The
  pictures we have are just the sort that the great artists sell to the picture
  galleries of provincial towns, and the concerts&mdash;well, the musicians who
  come down here put their heads together and make an effort to give us of
  their worst, so that they may be understood. Norchester is typically
  provincial, uncle. So long as we are here, we are plodding in the mud, almost
  the slough, and I mean to get out of it."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone turned to Philip.</p>

  <p>"Have you anything to say for yourself?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I agree with everything that Rosina has said," Philip answered. "I am
  grateful to you for your help and support, but I hate my work here. I want to
  get away."</p>

  <p>"You are the worst clerk," his uncle pronounced, "I ever kept in my office
  for twenty-four hours. You cannot add up a column of figures correctly, or
  post a single entry from the day book into the ledger to the right account.
  How do you propose to earn your living in London?"</p>

  <p>"Not as a clerk," Philip declared, with a little burst of passion.</p>

  <p>"Then how?" his uncle persisted.</p>

  <p>Philip thought of his little box full of manuscripts, and a tinge of
  colour flushed his cheeks. It seemed irreverent to speak of them as the means
  by which he was to earn his living.</p>

  <p>"I shall write stories," he announced. "I have written a few already."</p>

  <p>"Have you made any money out of them?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet."</p>

  <p>"Have you tried?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"Why do you think you will do better in London?"</p>

  <p>"Because no one could write anything worth while in such an atmosphere as
  this," was the almost fierce reply. "I agree with Rosina. We are in the mud
  here, drifting into the slough. I would sooner starve in London than own your
  factory here."</p>

  <p>"No one will deny you the opportunity," Benjamin Stone assured him coldly.
  "Now, Matthew, what have you to say? I understand that you, also, are
  concerned in this."</p>

  <p>"I am quite as determined to leave Norchester," Matthew replied, "but my
  reasons are entirely different ones. I have nothing against Norchester, if
  there were any money to be made here, but I have made up my mind that there
  is no future for me down at the factory."</p>

  <p>"Why not? You are a good worker, and, in some respects, capable."</p>

  <p>Matthew came a step nearer. His somewhat heavy face was alight with
  interest. He had the air of a much older man discussing a carefully
  thought-out problem.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "you give me two pounds ten a week for
  superintending the warehousing of your stock. I am worth more than that, but
  the job itself is too insignificant. I have studied the organisation of your
  factory all the way through, from the basement to the clicking room, and
  you're getting altogether behind the times. You've made a lot of money your
  way, no doubt, but the one fact you won't recognise is that times are
  changing. I don't see your balance sheets, but I'm convinced of one thing.
  You can't make any more by your present old-fashioned methods, and I'm not at
  all sure that you don't stand to lose a good part of what you've made. If,
  instead of two pounds ten a week to look after your stock of leather, you
  will offer me a thousand a year and allow me to remodel the factory from the
  cellars to the attic, remodel your system of buying and scrap half your old
  machinery, I might consider staying. Otherwise, I shall be glad of that
  hundred pounds' legacy you propose to pay me to-night, and I'm off to London
  with the others."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone turned his back upon them all, opened his desk and busied
  himself there for several moments. When he turned around, he had three oblong
  slips of paper in his hand.</p>

  <p>"There is your hundred pounds, Matthew," he said, presenting him with a
  cheque. "As for you others, you have some small amounts, I believe, in the
  Savings Bank."</p>

  <p>"We don't want any money from you, uncle," Rosina assured him hastily. "We
  just want to thank you for all you have done for us, and to ask you to
  forgive us because we are going away."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry that I was such a failure in the factory, sir," Philip said,
  "but you can see for yourself that I am no use in business."</p>

  <p>"You are useless in business because you are incompetent," Benjamin Stone
  replied firmly, "and you are incompetent because you are lazy, lazy in mind
  and lazy in body. I accept your thanks, and yours, Rosina, for what I have
  done for you. Here is a cheque for fifty pounds for each of you. Added to
  what you have, it may keep you from starvation for a few weeks longer. For
  the rest, leave this house when and how you choose. I shall ask you to
  remember only one thing&mdash;when you leave it, you leave it for ever."</p>

  <p>Philip accepted his cheque readily enough. Rosina took hers with
  hesitation. There was no shadow of kindliness or regret in the face of the
  donor. It was impossible to tell from his manner whether the departure of his
  charges were a sorrow or a relief to him.</p>

  <p>"We quite understand that, uncle," Rosina said, a little timidly. "It is
  very generous of you to give us this money, and, if we may, we should like to
  part friends."</p>

  <p>There was a momentous, almost a dread silence, a silence of which the
  significance existed only for three of the little gathering. Matthew, with
  knitted brows, was gazing over Rosina's shoulder at the cheque which she held
  in her fingers. To him, the words had been said, the farewells spoken; he had
  no sense of anything unusual in the room. He was engrossed simply by the
  problem as to whether he had been fairly dealt with in the matter of these
  farewell gifts. But, in their different ways, the girl and the boy trembling
  on the verge of life, their revolt rather of the soul than of the body; the
  man of iron, the pedagogue of narrow places, three times mayor of the town,
  and every Sunday an expounder of Christian principles according to his
  lights&mdash;these three had left Matthew on planes beneath. It was with a
  momentary exaltation that Benjamin opened the door and dismissed his
  rebellious charges, an exaltation which they more than shared. It was with a
  sensation of boredom and some resentment that Matthew followed them. The door
  was firmly closed, the three climbed the stairs and went to their rooms to
  prepare for their forthcoming journey. Benjamin Stone resumed his chair and
  drew the Bible towards him. Where he opened it, he read&mdash;read aloud to
  himself&mdash;read as one seeking hungrily for comfort in a world which for
  the first time he failed wholly to understand.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="a-3"
     name="a-3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Sunday, always an uncomfortable day for the younger inmates
  of Sion House, proved more than usually tedious on the morrow, both as an
  institution and in the slow monotony of its drawn-out hours. Rosina alone
  faced her uncle at breakfast, and, beyond the customary morning greeting, no
  word was spoken between the two until the school bell began to ring harshly
  at nine o'clock. Benjamin rose at once to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Have you arranged for your class?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I shall teach it myself," Rosina replied. "I can speak to Mrs. Haslem
  then about some one to take it over."</p>

  <p>He left the room without any further word. Rosina added to her simple
  yellow and white cotton frock a straw hat trimmed with buttercups, and made
  her way through the private gate, across the asphalt pavement, to the dreary
  schoolroom whose whitewashed walls were hung with texts and pictorial
  representations of Scriptural happenings. She bore her part in the attempted
  instruction of a dozen or more ungainly, unprepossessing and unimaginative
  children, spoke a few kindly words to them of farewell, without evoking,
  however, the slightest trace of any feeling save one of curiosity as to a
  possible successor. She was forced to use more than her usual tact in
  avoiding the attentions of the male teachers, frock-coated and silk-hatted
  youths of anemic complexion and artificial ways. The pastor himself, an older
  and somewhat more robust replica of the species, stopped her at the door. He
  was a young man of goodly qualities and narrow vision, who had, however, an
  honest belief in himself and his work. His parentage was Scotch.</p>

  <p>"This is ill news I am hearing from your uncle, Miss Vonet," he said,
  shaking hands with her and forgetting to release her fingers. "I am glad of
  the opportunity of a word with you on the subject."</p>

  <p>Rosina was not in the least inclined to submit to outside admonitions.
  Besides, she had had quite enough of the Reverend Donald Stuart and his
  far-away love-making.</p>

  <p>"I don't think that it can be very ill news for any one," she replied.
  "Personally, I am delighted at the idea of leaving Norchester, and I can't
  think that it matters very much to any one else whether I go or stay."</p>

  <p>"There's more than that about it," the young man said earnestly. "Mind,
  I'm not agreeing with you. There are others besides your uncle who will miss
  you. It's not only that, however. London is no place for young women,
  especially young women not properly protected. It's a city that's full of
  snares and pitfalls."</p>

  <p>"I think I shall rather like places like that," Rosina told him
  ingenuously. "I am very tired of Norchester."</p>

  <p>"It does not become a man or woman or child, desiring to live a Christian
  life, to speak with levity of the paths that lead to sin," the pastor
  continued gravely. "If the conditions of your life here have not provided you
  with the happiness you desire, remember that they may at any time be
  changed."</p>

  <p>"I don't see how," Rosina replied. "My uncle wouldn't even let me join the
  tennis club."</p>

  <p>"If that were all," the young man declared, with some eagerness, "perhaps
  something might be arranged. The tennis club to which you allude is
  frequented by the more frivolous portion of the community in this district,
  and your uncle's objection to it is entirely justified. It is in my mind,
  however, to start something of the sort in connection with the chapel. If
  every care were exercised as to membership, I do not believe that your uncle
  would have any objection to your joining. It is my hope, indeed, that he may
  afford us financial assistance."</p>

  <p>"Very nice for you all, I'm sure," Rosina remarked, "but I should think a
  tennis club limited to the members of your congregation would be terribly
  dull. Besides, I don't know of any one who can play."</p>

  <p>"We could learn," he suggested humbly.</p>

  <p>Rosina laughed at him pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"I only mentioned the tennis club allegorically, Mr. Stuart," she said.
  "You wouldn't understand my reasons, for wishing to go to London, and if you
  did, you wouldn't approve of them. Besides, everything now is definitely
  arranged."</p>

  <p>She moved forward but he still blocked the way. He was a short man, with
  curly flaxen hair, and even now, in his youthful days, inclined to
  corpulence. From his point of view, Rosina was a sister in grievous danger.
  She also appealed to him in another, and altogether unsisterly fashion.</p>

  <p>"There is something I had made up my mind to say to you, Miss Vonet," he
  announced, "which might possibly have weight with you in considering this
  matter."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Stuart," she replied, looking into his narrow but very earnest blue
  eyes, "nothing that you could possibly say would make the slightest
  difference."</p>

  <p>"Your uncle," he began&mdash;</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"My uncle," she interrupted, "belongs to the world I am leaving. We have
  bidden one another farewell. He is a good and just man, I have no doubt, but
  to me he is simply a granite image. Please do not quote my uncle."</p>

  <p>"Then may I speak for myself?" he persisted.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," Rosina replied, "but if you do I am sure I shall laugh. I
  don't want to do that&mdash;I know that it wouldn't be respectable. There are
  so many well-behaved and nice young women in your congregation. Save up what
  you were going to say, please, for one of them."</p>

  <p>She took advantage of a sudden movement on his part and flitted by him.
  The elderly vice-superintendent of the schools, who had been waiting for her,
  made an effort to cut off her retreat. Rosina, however, by a strategic move,
  avoided him by returning to the house instead of directly entering the
  chapel. She found Matthew deep in thought in the ugly and shiny parlour. He
  was engaged in making some calculations on the back of an envelope, and he
  looked at her in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Hello," he exclaimed, "I thought you were going to chapel?"</p>

  <p>"So I am presently," she replied. "I've come in to take cover for a
  moment. Am I looking rather nice this morning, Matthew?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her with stolid and level scrutiny. There was something in
  his eyes, however, which escaped her.</p>

  <p>"You are always attractive, Rosina," he said. "These summery clothes may
  not be altogether to the liking of the chapel folk, but they suit you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, the chapel folk are liking me all right!" she laughed. "I've just had
  to use all my ingenuity to stop Mr. Stuart proposing to me. Then I discovered
  Mr. Holmes lurking about with danger in his eye."</p>

  <p>"A widower grocer with six children!" Matthew scoffed.</p>

  <p>"A human being, I suspect, although a Sunday-school vice-superintendent!"
  Rosina remarked, looking at herself in the mirror. "Of course, these people
  ought not to admire my type at all, but they seem to. There would be a lot of
  trouble if I were staying here much longer! What are you figuring out so
  carefully, Matthew?"</p>

  <p>"I am going into the subject of my finances," Matthew said, with a frown.
  "I don't mind telling you that I am disappointed. I confidently expected a
  farewell gift of some sort or another from Uncle Benjamin."</p>

  <p>"You've got your hundred pounds," she reminded him.</p>

  <p>"The hundred pounds was not a gift at all," he declared. "It was a legacy
  to which I had a right. I am the only one of the three who has been any real
  use to him, and I do not understand his reason for giving you two fifty
  pounds and me nothing."</p>

  <p>"I would rather he had given neither of us anything," Rosina confessed.
  "We could do without the money easily, and it only increases our sense of
  indebtedness."</p>

  <p>"No one can do without money," Matthew said sternly. "I am surprised to
  hear you talk like that, Rosina. That fifty pounds would have put my finances
  in much better shape."</p>

  <p>"I'm willing to divide, if Philip is," Rosina suggested.</p>

  <p>"I may take advantage of your offer," Matthew replied, with a covetous
  gleam in his eyes. "I shall consider the matter."</p>

  <p>"In the meantime, do look out and see if the coast is clear for me,
  there's a dear," Rosina begged. "I don't want to go in too late, it makes
  uncle so cross, but another attempted proposal before service would make me
  hysterical."</p>

  <p>Matthew rose to his feet and looked out of the window.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Holmes has just gone inside," he announced. "There is no one else
  there except a few women and the verger."</p>

  <p>"Then here goes!" she exclaimed, as she left the room.</p>

  <p>Rosina sat by her uncle's side in the front pew of the chapel, prayed when
  he prayed, sang when he sang, and composed herself as comfortably as might be
  in the hard, pinewood seat, to listen to the words of exhortation addressed
  by Mr. Stuart to his congregation. She recognised the fact more than once
  that she was in the preacher's mind. He spoke of the joy of the safe places,
  the spiritual discomfort of worldly wanderings, the impossibility of touching
  pitch without becoming defiled. He spoke of the beauty of Christian love, and
  the holy and satisfying beauty of living in one's appointed spot. Rosina
  yawned. When it was over, she left the chapel with light, eager footsteps.
  Her uncle, as she well knew, must remain to count the offertory.</p>

  <p>"In my heart," she murmured, as she crossed the asphalt pavement, "I know
  that I am religious, only it isn't that sort."</p>

  <p>There was the savour of hot meat and cooked vegetables in the house when
  Rosina returned, and there followed a dreary meal, a trial more abundant than
  usual on account of Mr. Stuart's presence and Philip's absence. The harsh
  clanging of the Sunday-school bell found her in a state of insurrection. She
  abandoned her class and shut herself up in her room to pack, a task to which
  she devoted herself with so much fervour that the hours slipped by without
  her noticing them. The tea bell remained unanswered. Philip, who had returned
  from the country, brought her a cup into her room. Afterwards, he sat for a
  few moments on her trunk and talked to her.</p>

  <p>"Matthew and I are not to put in an appearance again at the factory," he
  announced. "Uncle Benjamin has just made it very clear that the less he sees
  of any of us after breakfast to-morrow morning, the better he will be
  pleased."</p>

  <p>"Well, that suits us, doesn't it?" Rosina remarked. "I'm simply aching in
  every limb to find myself in the train."</p>

  <p>Philip nodded.</p>

  <p>"I am with you entirely," he declared. "The only thing is that I ought to
  have tidied up a little down at the office. I'm afraid I left things in
  rather a muddle."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you go down now and clear up?" Rosina suggested. "You have your
  key."</p>

  <p>Philip slipped to the ground.</p>

  <p>"An idea!" he exclaimed. "I'll go down and say good-by to the old
  shop."</p>

  <p>He took his hat and stick, boarded a tramcar and rode to the principal
  industrial suburb of the town, where his uncle's factory was situated. The
  enterprise somewhat appealed to him. So many times he had found himself
  travelling in the same direction with a sense almost of nausea at the idea of
  his day's task, that this detached mission of his seemed to possess a flavour
  of originality. He looked at the grim factory, when he arrived at the end of
  the street where it was situated, with new eyes, swung open the heavy door,
  and looked into each of the long, ghostlike rooms as he ascended. He whistled
  softly to himself as he entered the office. The safe door was open, the cash
  box upon the table. It pleased his fancy to light a cigarette and smoke it in
  these hallowed precincts.</p>

  <p>"I was certainly not meant to be a clerk," he remarked, as he looked
  around him. "I was afraid I hadn't put the cash box away."</p>

  <p>He looked at it for a moment in puzzled fashion. There were several fat
  sheaves of Treasury notes lying in the top compartment. He took them up and
  counted them.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it's all right," he muttered, as he held them in his hand
  before putting them away. "I thought there were eight of these packets," he
  added, running the notes through his fingers,&mdash;"fifty pounds each. Must
  have been seven."</p>

  <p>He was in the act of locking the safe when he stopped short and listened.
  There was a sort of shuffling sound below, as though some one were descending
  the stairs stealthily. He hurried out and stood upon the landing.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he shouted. "Who's there?"</p>

  <p>There was no reply. The sound had ceased. Philip began to wonder whether
  he was a coward. His heart was beating more quickly. The ghostly silence of
  the place unnerved him.</p>

  <p>"Hullo there!" he shouted, more loudly still.</p>

  <p>Again no reply. Philip felt his forehead and found that it was wet.</p>

  <p>"This is damned foolishness!" he muttered. "There can be no one in the
  place."</p>

  <p>At that moment the outside door closed, not with a bang but with soft and
  stealthy deliberation. Philip hurried into the clicking room, on his way to
  the broad windows which commanded the street. The room, however, was divided
  into two by a partition, and the communicating door was locked. By the time
  he had made his way round and scrambled upon the bench to obtain a view of
  the street, there was nothing to be seen. He jumped down and shook the dust
  from his clothes.</p>

  <p>"This is imagination," he decided. "There was no one there&mdash;there
  could have been no one there."</p>

  <p>Thereupon he made a brave showing. He retraced his steps to the office,
  completed his task of leaving everything in order, helped himself to his old
  coat and cap, descended the stairs, let himself out and marched boldly up the
  street. For ever afterwards in his mind, however, he registered a dislike for
  empty buildings.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later, Benjamin Stone sat in the chair which Philip had
  vacated. The cash box stood open before him, a small memorandum book was by
  his side. Three times he counted the little sheaves of notes, three times he
  turned back and compared them with the rough wage book. Then he abandoned his
  task. He sat very still, looking through the glass front of the office down
  the long, empty room beyond. An earnest and profound religious belief had
  helped him to find every crisis in life simple. For the first time he was
  assailed with doubts. For the first time he felt the grim despair of a man
  confronted with unimagined tragedy. He was a man who loved money, but it was
  not the loss of the fifty pounds which had brought the grey colour into his
  cheeks and that sense of horror into his whole being. It was the fact that
  the thief was one of those brought up under his own roof, for whose moral
  probity he was almost responsible. He picked up Philip's cigarette stump and
  threw it into the wastepaper basket, gazed at the empty peg from which the
  cap and coat had vanished. Then, with a little groan, his head sank upon his
  folded arms.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="a-4"
     name="a-4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The pilgrimage commenced on the following day a little
  tremulously for Rosina and Philip, notwithstanding their boundless
  enthusiasm; confidently and placidly for Matthew. They found, on the night of
  their arrival in London, three small bedrooms and a smaller sitting room, on
  the fifth floor of a lodging house in Maltby Street, W. C., which is
  somewhere between Long Acre and the district where second-hand book shops and
  hand-printed notices of "Rooms to let for single gentlemen" suggest the
  neighbourhood of the British Museum. Their breakfast, on the following
  morning, consisted of an egg each, a loaf of bread and a quarter of a pound
  of butter, commodities selected by Matthew during an early morning stroll
  around the neighbourhood. Rosina made tea in a brown teapot, and urns were
  for ever solemnly forsworn. Matthew was for starting out immediately on the
  great adventure, but for once in his life he gave way to popular clamour. It
  was Rosina's entreaties which prevailed.</p>

  <p>"Our first day in London, Matthew," she pleaded. "We must spend it all
  together, and spend it wonderfully."</p>

  <p>"I rather thought of calling on a few firms in the city," Matthew remarked
  thoughtfully. "One must make a start."</p>

  <p>"Oh, bother your start!" Rosina laughed. "You can do as you like
  to-morrow, but to-day we stretch our arms and look up at the sun and thank
  God for our freedom! We are going to count the treasures which the fates may
  have in store for us."</p>

  <p>"You mean that you are going to waste a day," Matthew rejoined
  stolidly.</p>

  <p>"Not waste it," Philip declared. "We are going to pause just for a moment
  and look down on the city of our desires. We are going to play the conscious
  and deliberate philanderer. We are going to choose our places in the scheme
  of the Universe, with care and caution."</p>

  <p>"You're right if you mean that it's no use accepting the first thing
  that's offered," Matthew agreed, a little puzzled. "I shall call on at least
  five places in the city before I make up my mind."</p>

  <p>Philip was rolling a cigarette with a broad grin upon his face. Rosina
  leaned over and passed her arm around Matthew's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Don't be so atrociously literal, Matthew," she begged. "What I propose is
  this. London is the city of allegories. Let us each show the other what it is
  that we seek in life; then to-morrow we will set to work in earnest to find
  it. Let to-day be a day of dreams; to-morrow we can take the first step on
  the ladder of attainment."</p>

  <p>"If you'd put it into plain English," Matthew grumbled, "I should know
  where I was. Do you mean that we go riding about on 'buses all day, because
  that costs money?"</p>

  <p>"Listen," Rosina continued, "you have done all the practical work up to
  now. You showed us how to get our money out of the Savings Bank, you
  bargained for the rooms here and got them a great deal cheaper than we should
  have done, you even brought the breakfast. It rests with you, then, to begin.
  Take us to the Mecca of your dreams, show us the places where you desire to
  be supreme. After you have finished, we will follow where Philip leads. And
  after that, it will be my turn."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Matthew agreed, "get your things on and we'll start at once.
  No need to waste any time over my part of the show."</p>

  <p>He piloted them to a 'bus, where, by reason of his pushfulness, they
  obtained front seats. Slowly they made their way citywards. As they drew near
  the Mansion House, the blocks in the traffic grew more frequent. They became
  jammed in a medley of vehicles. The pavements were crowded with streams of
  hurrying men, with here and there a few girls and young women. Matthew
  pointed downwards.</p>

  <p>"There you are," he said, "there's one thing I brought you here to show
  you. You've watched the people pass through the streets in Norchester. They
  just look as though they were going to any old place, and it didn't matter a
  row of pins when they got there or what they did when they arrived. Now look
  at the faces of these people. They've got something else written there, every
  one of them, men and women alike. I'm not much of a hand at this sort of job,
  but you can see what I mean, can't you?"</p>

  <p>"They're out for something definite," Philip declared.</p>

  <p>"That's right," Matthew assented approvingly. "They're seekers. They've
  either got jobs that they want to push along with, or they're all in a hurry
  to shoulder some one else out of the way and climb another notch in the
  ladder. You see that, Philip? And you, Rosina?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely!" they both agreed.</p>

  <p>"Now let's get off, then," Matthew suggested. "I'll show you where my gods
  are enshrined."</p>

  <p>They walked down Threadneedle and Lombard streets, and Matthew rolled off
  the names on the brass plates with amazing familiarity.</p>

  <p>"Here they are," he pointed out. "The men in the bank parlours are the
  governors of the world to-day. It's a place in there I covet. I don't want to
  sit in a row behind the plate-glass windows, but back in the private room,
  with a Turkey carpet beneath my feet, a mahogany desk before me, and half a
  dozen telephones by my side. I want my private secretary to enter the room on
  tiptoe&mdash;will I see an emissary from the Governors of the Bank of
  England?&mdash;a financial secretary to the Treasury is waiting&mdash;the
  greatest of American millionaires is anxious for me to lunch with him! Come
  along this way."</p>

  <p>He led them to the front of the Stock Exchange. Rosina and Philip looked
  with amazement at the surging crowds of well-dressed men. The thrill of
  money-making was in the air. The shadow of unwholesome anxiety seemed lurking
  in the faces of the men who streamed in and out of the great building.</p>

  <p>"These are the parasites," Matthew continued, a little contemptuously,
  "the slaves of the men who sit in the bank parlours of the world. Some day I
  shall pull the strings, and who cares to may watch the faces."</p>

  <p>They turned away. Matthew walked apart for a few moments in absorbed
  silence. He was as nearly moved as ever they had seen him.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said at last, "I have had my turn. Now you can be guide,
  Philip."</p>

  <p>They took a 'bus as far as Fleet Street. Here they got out and walked
  slowly down the thronged thoroughfare.</p>

  <p>"For me it is more difficult to reach the concrete," Philip expounded,
  "but here, on either side of us, are the newspaper offices of the country. If
  you listen, you can hear the roar of the machinery above the sound of the
  traffic. The written word of the cleverest men whom the genius of selection
  can bring together is being flung into type to carry its message all over the
  world. Somewhere up in those quieter rooms, shut off from the world by green
  baize doors and jealous secretaries, men sit and think. Imagine their power!
  The word that flows from their pen will fashion the thought of to-morrow.
  They let loose the dogs of war or hold them in. The power of your men in the
  bank parlours is great enough, Matthew, but what about these? They direct the
  thought of the world. The men in the bank parlours can only change its
  temporal fortunes."</p>

  <p>"The Press is a great power," Matthew acknowledged tolerantly. "Broadly
  speaking, there is reason in what you say, but the financial papers
  themselves can be bought or sold. Lombard Street has only to stretch out its
  hand, dripping with gold, and their leading articles become nothing more nor
  less than advertisements."</p>

  <p>"The financial papers are out of my scheme," Philip objected. "They do not
  belong to the Press proper. Come, this is only the first phase," he added.
  "Now for the corollary."</p>

  <p>He led them, breathless and a little protesting, to the top of the
  Monument. London stretched out below them in great arteries, thoroughfares
  and bridges crowded with human beings and traffic.</p>

  <p>"There the world goes," Philip said, leaning down absorbedly, "moving
  according to plan. Who set it going no one can say; who will stop it no one
  can tell. Wagons and lorries, tradesmen's carts and costers' barrows,
  taxicabs, automobiles and pedestrians&mdash;they are all bound for some
  definite rendezvous, all part of the great scheme of life."</p>

  <p>"Not too much philosophising, please, Philip," Rosina begged, passing her
  arm through his.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to philosophise at all," Philip rejoined. "I want to
  understand."</p>

  <p>Matthew was a little contemptuous, wholly unsympathetic.</p>

  <p>"What's the good of bothering about other people?" he asked bluntly. "I
  don't care a hang where all these crowds are going to, or what they are
  thinking about. I want to get at my own job, and get on with it as quickly as
  ever I can."</p>

  <p>"You may get on with your own job better for understanding theirs," Philip
  replied. "It isn't apparent, I know, but they are all making their way down
  different avenues to one common end. Directly one understands that, one has
  sympathy, and directly one has sympathy, one begins to feel, one is conscious
  of the power which is only born with feeling."</p>

  <p>Matthew was frankly bored. Philip was almost eagerly apologetic as they
  descended once more into the crowded thoroughfare.</p>

  <p>"I know this sort of thing isn't much in your line, old fellow," he said,
  passing his arm through Matthew's, "and, of course, the silly way I express
  myself must make it all sound like bunkum. But there's something underneath
  which I can't quite get at. It's stirring there, though, and it's going to
  help me. I shall write stories, Matthew, and believe me, my dear commercial
  soul, the man in the street will buy them. Sometimes, even the people who
  understand cannot write. The people who crave to understand, however, nearly
  always can. The desire is the great thing."</p>

  <p>"My chief desire at present," Matthew declared, looking at his watch, "is
  for luncheon."</p>

  <p>They found a place close at hand, carefully selected by Matthew, who
  ordered the luncheon and checked each item on the bill before he paid. He
  then collected their shares from his two companions, and they sallied out
  into the street again.</p>

  <p>"Now it's my turn!" Rosina exclaimed. "I shall probably shock you both. I
  am going to show you what a pagan I really am."</p>

  <p>She took them to Bond Street and dragged them from shop window to shop
  window. Her face lit up as she discoursed to them of silks and laces, of
  Paris models, of pearls and Cartier's jewellery. She studied with frank envy
  the beautifully gowned women whom they passed. Once, lingering in front of a
  shop window, she began to laugh and pointed to their reflections.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what Bond Street is thinking of us!" she exclaimed. "Don't let
  us ever forget our first appearance here!"</p>

  <p>There was a certain quaintness about the trio, and certainly more than one
  passer-by turned to look at them. Both the young men were wearing ready-made
  suits of Norchester design, Philip a soft collar and tweed cap, Matthew a
  carefully-brushed bowler hat. There was something about them suggestive of
  the Saturday morning crowd poured into London from the north to witness a
  Football Final. Yet, at the same time, they each possessed something apart
  from the class to which their clothes and obvious lack of familiarity with
  their surroundings would seem to relegate them. Matthew's claims to
  originality consisted in his stolid but unobtrusive self-assurance, and the
  suggestion of power in his obstinate jaw and firm lips; Philip's in his
  Byronic type of face, his nervous features and restless eyes. Rosina, walking
  between the two, presented even more puzzling anomalies. Her primly
  fashioned, homely clothes were powerless to conceal the grace of her young
  limbs and body. Her girlish, almost childish air of delight in her
  surroundings, her soft, eager laughter, her complete absence of any form of
  self-consciousness, all lent an unanalysable distinction to her more obvious
  attractiveness. Passers-by turned to look after her, puzzled. The modern
  boulevardier found himself at fault. There was no place in his classification
  of the other sex for anything so entirely ingenuous and yet so charming.</p>

  <p>"And now," Rosina declared, as they reached Piccadilly again, after having
  traversed both sides of Bond Street, "I am going to redeem myself a little.
  Come along."</p>

  <p>She took them to the National Gallery, and again her selective instinct
  was almost as true as her perception for the slighter things. She revelled in
  many of the pictures and much of the statuary, Philip sharing to some extent
  her enthusiasm. She was frankly indifferent to some of the world's
  masterpieces, but she made no mistake in what really appealed to her. Their
  visit was cut short owing to Matthew's impatience. She passed her arm through
  his as they stood upon the steps, looking down over Trafalgar Square.</p>

  <p>"Matthew dear," she said, "if this is boring you, I'm sorry, but I somehow
  feel that to-day is going to be a very important day for all of us. We have
  grown up together, we three. We have suffered together. This is our first day
  of freedom. We are all going to strike out along different paths, and I feel
  that, unless we understand one another, we may very soon drift a long way
  apart. I suppose I'm terribly frivolous because the greatest passion I feel,
  just now, is the love of beautiful things, but I'm trying to show
  you&mdash;it isn't for the body only&mdash;there's the mind and the soul,
  too. Come, we're going down on the Embankment now. I want to sit and look at
  Westminster Abbey, and see the tugs go down the river under the bridges."</p>

  <p>They spent a desultory hour or so wandering along the Embankment, having
  tea at a coffee stall, watching the circling gulls and the haze on the other
  side of the water. The brilliancy of the summer day passed early away, little
  patches of white mist hung, shroudlike, over the higher stretches of the
  river. The sun was obscured, an oppressive heat seemed to rise from the baked
  pavements. There seemed to be no breath of air anywhere. Over the city, the
  yellow bank of clouds parted once or twice to reveal the lurid glory of a
  blaze of sheet lightning. Matthew rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I think we'll be moving along," he suggested. "There's a storm not far
  away, and we haven't an umbrella between us. If we get wet through, our
  clothes will be spoilt."</p>

  <p>They moved up the Savoy Hill and were caught in the stream of vehicles
  turning into the Savoy courtyard. A few spots of rain were falling. Rosina
  clutched at the arms of her two companions and dragged them up to the
  sheltered end, near the Theatre. They watched the people
  arriving&mdash;Matthew with a certain stolid interest at the display of so
  much wealth and luxury, Philip with half-amused, half-wistful curiosity,
  Rosina with a pleasure which was almost passionate in its intensity. The
  women looked at their best in the zephyrlike clothing of a summer night; the
  men, with their dazzling shirt fronts and glossy silk hats, seemed to belong
  to a world in which Norchester had no part. Through the great plate-glass
  windows, they could catch a glimpse of the <i>ma&icirc;tres d'h&ocirc;tel</i>
  moving about, ushering guests to their tables. From the restaurant far below,
  they could hear, now and then, the strains of music. Rosina clung to her two
  companions.</p>

  <p>"Philip," she murmured breathlessly, "Matthew&mdash;we must hurry&mdash;we
  must get on quickly! You, Matthew, must make money. You, Philip, must get
  your stories published. I want to come here and dance with you both, and I
  want you to have clothes like these men, and I want to have a white lace
  dress like that girl who has just gone in, with white silk stockings and
  silver shoes, and a cloud of ermine all over me."</p>

  <p>Philip laughed indulgently.</p>

  <p>"The day my first novel is published," he promised, "we will all dine
  here."</p>

  <p>"Before six months have passed," Matthew declared, "I shall lunch at that
  table by the window. In a year's time, I shall dine here whenever I
  choose."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="a-5"
     name="a-5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Rosina, alone in the sitting room at Maltby Street, bending
  over her typewriter, in the manipulation of which, after seven months'
  continual practice, she was now entirely proficient, paused suddenly to
  listen, with her fingers in the air. There was a step outside. The door was
  opened without ceremony. With a quick effort, she kept the expression of
  disappointment from her face. It was Matthew who entered.</p>

  <p>"Working late, aren't you?" he remarked, glancing at the pile of
  manuscript by her side.</p>

  <p>"A little later than usual," she assented.</p>

  <p>"Where's dinner?" he demanded, looking at the unlaid table.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you would mind very much, Matthew," she suggested uneasily,
  "if we went out to get something to eat to-night? If we go to a very cheap
  place, there isn't much difference, is there, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And what?" Matthew insisted.</p>

  <p>"Well, I haven't been out to the shops to buy anything," she explained.
  "Somehow or other, the time slipped away."</p>

  <p>"Have you got any money to buy anything with, Rosina?" he asked
  bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Not much," she admitted.</p>

  <p>Matthew slowly removed his overcoat and hung it over the back of a chair.
  It was quite a well-cut garment, and came from the same tailor as the
  conventional but well-cut city clothes which he was wearing. He dragged a
  chair across to the table.</p>

  <p>"Let's have a look at the book," he invited.</p>

  <p>A little flush of colour stole into Rosina's pale cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it isn't quite made up," she confessed.</p>

  <p>"You may as well show it to me," he persisted. "I can pretty well guess
  how things are."</p>

  <p>Rosina opened a drawer and handed it reluctantly across to him&mdash;a
  small black account book which she had purchased with great pride seven
  months ago. Matthew drew a pencil from his pocket and glanced rapidly through
  the pages. He was silent for several moments, then he laid it down.</p>

  <p>"Has all Philip's money gone?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"Every penny of it," Rosina answered.</p>

  <p>"And yours?"</p>

  <p>"When I have paid my share up to last Saturday," she admitted, "all mine
  will have gone, too."</p>

  <p>He glanced back at the book.</p>

  <p>"Philip has paid nothing for four weeks," he observed.</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all."</p>

  <p>"That means," he continued ruthlessly, "that you and I have been
  supporting him."</p>

  <p>"Don't!" she begged. "Philip will pay us back. He is sure to have a story
  accepted presently."</p>

  <p>"I am beginning to doubt it," Matthew replied. "In the meantime, it will
  be Saturday again directly. Philip will have nothing to contribute to the
  book. What about you?"</p>

  <p>Her head disappeared for a moment between her hands.</p>

  <p>"I shall only have fifteen shillings," she sighed. "I have to pay for the
  hire of the typewriter, and they charge me for the paper and the carbons and
  everything. I worked till two o'clock this morning, Matthew. It seems
  hopeless to try and make enough to live on by copying alone."</p>

  <p>Matthew sat with knitted brows, drumming on the table with his
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"Where is Philip now?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Out somewhere," she answered, a little drearily. "He took two of his
  stories round to show to the editor of a new magazine some one had told him
  about."</p>

  <p>Matthew's silence was ominous. She looked anxiously across the table
  towards him, trying to read his thoughts. His face was inscrutable.</p>

  <p>"Matthew," she went on, "you won't mind, will you, if Philip and I are a
  little behind for a week or two? Philip must sell some stories soon. They
  really are good, Matthew. The one he wrote last week is wonderful. And I'll
  try and get something else to do instead of this typing&mdash;something they
  pay more money for."</p>

  <p>Matthew rose slowly to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Have you had anything to eat to-day, Rosina?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Some tea and bread and butter for lunch," she answered. "But I'm not
  hungry," she added eagerly. "I am really not hungry. I don't seem to need
  much food."</p>

  <p>"Was Philip here for lunch?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he was here," she admitted. "Mrs. Heath sent up what she called one
  portion of some sort of beef. Philip said it wasn't bad. I couldn't touch
  it."</p>

  <p>"Put on your hat," Matthew directed. "You and I will go out and get some
  dinner."</p>

  <p>"What about Philip?" she asked hesitatingly.</p>

  <p>"Leave a note for him, if you want to," was the indifferent reply.</p>

  <p>"But Philip has no money," she reminded him, "and Mrs. Heath won't let us
  have anything unless it is paid for. You can see by the book that I haven't
  quite settled last week's account."</p>

  <p>Matthew, with obvious reluctance, produced a shilling.</p>

  <p>"You can leave this with the note," he said. "Get ready at once, please. I
  didn't have beef for lunch, and I like my dinner punctually."</p>

  <p>"I won't be a moment," she promised. "Don't be cross, there's a dear,
  Matthew. I'm so glad we're going out."</p>

  <p>She crossed the room as lightly and gracefully as ever, and he heard the
  door of her own little chamber close behind her. He walked up and down the
  room with his hands in his pockets, picked up the account book again, looked
  through it with renewed care, and threw it back on the table with a gesture
  of irritation. Then he glanced at the scrap of paper which Rosina had left
  for Philip, and read her message:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Philip, dear, I am going out to have some dinner with
  Matthew. He is very hungry and doesn't want to wait. You won't mind, will
  you? I'm afraid I have been extravagant this week and there's only a shilling
  to spare.</p>

  <p class="letter">We'll be back soon and I'll try and get some coffee.</p>

  <p class="letter">Love, dear, from<br>
  <span class="smcap">Rosina</span></p><br>

  <p>He replaced the note with a frown. Rosina returned, a moment or two later,
  humming a gay tune and buttoning some very much darned gloves. She was
  wearing the grey costume in which she had travelled up to London in the early
  summer months. Matthew looked at her critically.</p>

  <p>"You can't go out like that," he protested. "There's an east wind, and
  it's cold enough for snow. Where's your coat?"</p>

  <p>"Gone to be altered," she replied, examining her glove closely. "I'm not a
  bit cold, really."</p>

  <p>He put on his own warm overcoat, drew on his gloves and stroked the nap of
  his hat thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Where is your coat, Rosina?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She made a grimace at him.</p>

  <p>"Don't be melodramatic, Matthew," she begged, "and don't look at me as
  though I were some sort of starving heroine. My coat's pawned, if you must
  know."</p>

  <p>"Tell me about it," he insisted.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing to tell. You were out to dinner last night. Philip and I
  were starving and we had exactly two-pence between us. It was an awful joke,
  really, and I don't want a coat with the spring coming on."</p>

  <p>"What about Philip's own coat?"</p>

  <p>A spot of colour flamed in her cheeks, her eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd, Matthew!" she exclaimed. "You know how bad Philip's
  cough is, and his clothes are much thinner than mine."</p>

  <p>"Get the ticket," he ordered.</p>

  <p>"Matthew," she begged, "don't be angry with me."</p>

  <p>"I am not angry&mdash;with you," he answered. "Please get the ticket."</p>

  <p>She obeyed, and they descended the stairs in silence. During their
  progress to the corner of the street which she indicated, she shivered more
  than once. They entered the shop. Matthew put down a Treasury note and the
  coat was produced. Rosina wrapped herself up in it and her eyes shone with
  gratitude as she looked up at her companion.</p>

  <p>"After all," she confessed, "I think that I was a little cold."</p>

  <p>The evening was full of surprises for Rosina. For the first time since
  their arrival in London, she rode in a taxicab, sitting close to her
  companion, her arm through his, and thoroughly enjoying their progress
  through the lighted streets. It was not until they had reached the Strand and
  had turned into the Savoy courtyard, however, that she had the faintest idea
  as to their destination. She drew back at once.</p>

  <p>"Matthew," she exclaimed, horrified, "I couldn't possibly go in there!
  Look at my clothes!"</p>

  <p>"Leave it to me," he answered. "There is a grillroom, where one does not
  wear evening dress. I was there for luncheon, and I told them that I should
  probably be dining. Just leave it to me."</p>

  <p>Before she knew where she was, they had entered the wonderful building by
  a side door, and she found herself at once in an atmosphere of warmth and
  luxury. She waited whilst her companion handed his coat and hat to a bowing
  <i>vestiaire</i>, and in a sort of dream she followed him into the
  restaurant, preceded by a smiling and beckoning <i>ma&icirc;tre
  d'h&ocirc;tel</i>. They were ushered to a table which Matthew indicated, in a
  retired corner of the room.</p>

  <p>"No one will look at you here," he assured her, as they took their places.
  "All sorts of people come in at this time of the day&mdash;actresses from
  rehearsals, secretaries with their employers, travelling Americans who are in
  a hurry to get round the world and have no time to change. If you get hot,
  take off your coat and hang it across the back of a chair. For the rest,
  leave everything to me and enjoy your dinner."</p>

  <p>Rosina was a most appreciative guest. She gloried in the warmth and luxury
  of the room, the general atmosphere of well-being, the delicate food, the
  champagne which she tasted for the first time. She looked in almost awed
  wonder at her companion.</p>

  <p>"Matthew," she asked, "how can you possibly afford this?"</p>

  <p>"I have never done anything in my life which I could not afford," he
  answered, truthfully enough. "To-day I lunched here with my employer. I came
  in, a salaried servant at two hundred and fifty a year&mdash;even that
  represents three increases in six months&mdash;and I went out with a thousand
  a year for certain, and the prospect of a partnership."</p>

  <p>She could only murmur something incomprehensible. The figures dazzled her.
  The whole thing was too astonishing.</p>

  <p>"I have brought you here, Rosina," he went on, "to talk to you seriously.
  I am sorry for Philip, but it is perfectly clear that his idea of making
  money by writing stories is absurd. He cannot hold his own up here; neither
  can you by yourself. You can see exactly what the position is. Your earnings
  have been insufficient to keep you, and you have spent all your capital. I am
  the only one keeping up his payments. If I were to go on, I should soon be
  supporting the pair of you."</p>

  <p>"You are going to leave us?" she faltered, in genuine distress.</p>

  <p>"I certainly am," he agreed. "In a very short time, I shall have a
  definite position in the city, and I shall have to commence to make my way in
  other directions. Maltby Street is of no use to me at all. I have looked at
  some rooms to-day in the neighbourhood of St. James's Street. I shall move in
  there next week. You can come there with me, if you like&mdash;but not
  Philip."</p>

  <p>"But not Philip?" she repeated, a little dazed. "Why, what is he to do,
  then?"</p>

  <p>"That is not my business," Matthew replied. "I must tell you frankly,
  Rosina, that I am not proposing to cumber myself with a kindergarten. I will
  take care of you&mdash;you need not do any work at all unless you
  like&mdash;but I am certainly not prepared to support Philip."</p>

  <p>She looked across the table at him with horrified eyes.</p>

  <p>"You are going to leave us&mdash;you would have me leave him&mdash;just
  now, when he needs help most?" she protested. "Matthew, tell me that you
  don't mean it? You are spoiling everything."</p>

  <p>"I was never more serious in my life," he assured her stolidly. "Our
  triangular housekeeping is at an end. I start life under new auspices within
  the next few days. You can come with me, if you like, and a great deal that
  you prayed for when we left Norchester may in time come your way. Or you can
  stay with Philip, and either starve or find your way to the workhouse within
  the next few weeks."</p>

  <p>The light seemed to have died out of her face, the warmth of the wine from
  her veins. She shivered as though she were again feeling the cold.</p>

  <p>"I cannot leave Philip," she said gently. "I would not if I could. He
  needs me now more than he will at any time in life."</p>

  <p>"It is possible," Matthew declared, in measured tones, "that I am in the
  same position. It is for you to choose."</p>

  <p>She leaned back in her chair. In a sense, the world&mdash;her small
  world&mdash;seemed to be tumbling to pieces around her. Her thoughts flashed
  back to Norchester, to the sunny afternoon when the wind had made music in
  the rustling cornfields and the pine trees under which they had lain and
  planned their revolt. It was little more than six months ago, but an
  unsuspected shadow had crept into the world. She felt the change without
  being fully able to understand it.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you a little more about what happened to-day," Matthew went
  on, misjudging Rosina's hesitation. "I dare say you remember what I was
  always telling Uncle Benjamin about his factory and his method of running
  it."</p>

  <p>"You thought him behind the times," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Ridiculously! What I could foresee then is coming to pass more rapidly
  even than I had imagined. The business of Benjamin Stone and Company is going
  to the wall. They have lost their trade. Soon they will lose their credit. I
  begin to understand now why he kept his private ledger under such strict lock
  and key. He must have been losing money for years. It is my belief that he
  will be a bankrupt before the year is out."</p>

  <p>Rosina was amazed.</p>

  <p>"But I thought he was so wealthy," she gasped.</p>

  <p>"He had plenty of money at one time," Matthew admitted, "but there are few
  capitalists who can stand the drain of a losing business. Benjamin Stone is
  racing downhill. What there is good that remains in his business, I offered
  to Mr. Faringdon to-day."</p>

  <p>"But how could you do that?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Very easily," was the complacent reply. "When I left Norchester, I
  brought with me a complete list of the firm's customers, the goods they
  bought, the price they paid, and the costings of every boot and shoe
  manufactured. I also had a list of the raw material purchased, with special
  notes against all that was satisfactory. The only traveller the firm ever
  possessed who was of the slightest use to them I engaged a month ago on
  behalf of my present firm. When Benjamin Stone and Company go broke, as they
  must do before very long, we shall purchase the business, install the
  necessary machinery, and I have promised to take over the management of it
  for at least twelve months."</p>

  <p>"Poor Uncle Benjamin!" she sighed.</p>

  <p>"I never knew a man less deserving of pity," her companion rejoined
  curtly. "Now, Rosina," he went on, "I want you to make up your mind. It comes
  to this. You have to choose between Philip and me. I can give you a great
  deal of what you want in life. Philip can give you nothing."</p>

  <p>The shadow of that unformed trouble which had never wholly passed came
  back into her face.</p>

  <p>"But, Matthew," she expostulated, "how can I leave Philip?"</p>

  <p>"He has no more claim upon you than I have," was the brusque reply.</p>

  <p>Rosina shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure about that, Matthew," she told him. "We have not talked
  about it very much, because it seems rather a mockery just now, but I think
  that it is understood between us that some day, when his books are published
  and these evil times are over, we are going to be married."</p>

  <p>"His novels will never be published," Matthew declared. "Philip is of no
  account. I have watched him in the factory and in the office, making a daily
  muddle of the simplest jobs. If you want the silks and laces of Bond Street,
  Rosina, you will never get them from him."</p>

  <p>"Then I will do without them," she replied valiantly.</p>

  <p>Matthew called for the bill, tipped the waiter liberally, and also the
  <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>. His liberality, like his meanness, was of
  the measured order. Even during these first few months in London, he was
  building all the time for bigger things. To spend a purposeless sixpence
  which at no time could bring him any return, was an agony to him. A Treasury
  note given to a <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> with influence, he thought
  nothing of&mdash;it was an investment which was to return him value later
  on.</p>

  <p>"It is possible," he remarked, as they left the room together, "that in my
  conversation with you I have been a little premature. You still have faith in
  Philip. I have none. I shall remove my things from Maltby Street to-morrow
  morning, but I shall leave you my address. I think that you will probably
  change your mind. There will always be room for you in Bury Street."</p>

  <p>"I shall never change my mind," she assured him. "I think that I am one of
  those women who have inherited the fatal gift of fidelity. I am very fond
  indeed of Philip."</p>

  <p>"Affection needs some solid foundation," Matthew rejoined stubbornly.
  "Philip has no stamina, nothing whatever to build upon. He will disappoint
  you and make you miserable. Some day you will come to Bury Street."</p>

  <p>They drove back to their lodgings in another taxicab, almost in silence.
  As they neared their journey's end, Matthew took off his hat, placed it
  carefully upon the opposite seat and leaned towards her.</p>

  <p>"Rosina," he said, "I should like a kiss."</p>

  <p>"Why, my dear Matthew," she exclaimed, "you kiss me every night when you
  want to! But why choose a taxicab when we shall be in the sitting room in a
  moment?"</p>

  <p>"Philip will be there," he answered grimly.</p>

  <p>"But Philip is always there," she protested. "However, have it your own
  way."</p>

  <p>She leaned over and kissed him on the cheek. He suddenly caught her by the
  shoulders, turned her towards him and kissed her lips. She drew away,
  trembling. The shadow had deepened. She was suddenly in the dark forest of
  ugly places. She felt his eyes following her&mdash;cold, burning eyes. She
  began to rub her lips unconsciously.</p>

  <p>"Matthew," she faltered breathlessly, "you are very rough and a little
  cruel. No one has ever kissed me like that before. I dislike it. Will you
  please remember that?"</p>

  <p>"I shall remember," he promised, "so long as I think well."</p>

  <p>Rosina ran on ahead up the steep stairs. When she reached their tawdry
  little sitting room, which not even her eager hands had been able to make
  attractive, she found Philip asleep on the horsehair sofa. By his side was
  the note she had written. The shilling remained on the corner of the table,
  untouched. There was a faint smell of spirits in the atmosphere, a smell
  which Rosina had already learned to loathe.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="a-6"
     name="a-6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Matthew entered in the midst of Rosina's almost tearful
  remonstrances. He drew off his overcoat, looking all the time at Philip with
  an air of disfavour. Philip, as a matter of fact, was not looking his best.
  His collar was soiled, his tie had wandered to one side, his clothes were
  crumpled and his hair unkempt. He seemed thinner than ever, and the single
  spot of colour in his cheeks was certainly not healthy. Yet there was a sort
  of grace about him as, with his elbow on the back of the sofa and his head
  resting upon his hand, he listened with a smile, half-apologetic and
  half-conciliatory, to Rosina's remonstrances.</p>

  <p>"It's really no good being angry with me," he said. "I walked all the way
  down to the other side of Fleet Street to see a fellow who knows an editor.
  We went to several wine shops together to try and find him. My friend stood
  me two drinks. I'd rather he'd paid for something to eat, but I couldn't
  mention it, could I?"</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you go out and get something when you reached home?" Rosina
  protested.</p>

  <p>Philip looked at the shilling.</p>

  <p>"That doesn't belong to me," he said. "My money has gone."</p>

  <p>"I never heard such nonsense!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"It is not nonsense," Matthew intervened, lighting a cigarette. "The
  matter has to be faced. I have been looking into the accounts this evening.
  Your capital has gone, Philip&mdash;so has Rosina's. I am the only one who
  has paid all his share towards the housekeeping for the last three weeks, and
  I understand that Mrs. Heath has not been fully paid."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do about it?" Philip asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"I am going to leave you," Matthew announced. "I am going to move into
  more suitable rooms in Bury Street to-morrow. I have been telling Rosina of
  my intention."</p>

  <p>"Very wise of you," Philip observed sarcastically. "You might have been
  stuck for next week's rent."</p>

  <p>"I shall pay my share of that, as I am leaving without notice, and that
  will be the end of my responsibility," Matthew rejoined. "Before I go,
  however, there is just a word I have to say."</p>

  <p>"Get on with it," Philip invited.</p>

  <p>"You have been in London seven months," Matthew proceeded deliberately,
  "during which time you have spent the whole of your savings. You have earned
  nothing. Consequently, you are at the moment penniless. Rosina has also spent
  her savings, although she, unlike you, has earned a trifle which has gone
  towards your support. We agreed to start life together, but we are in no
  sense of the word partners. I am leaving you to-morrow. How do you propose to
  live?"</p>

  <p>The pent-up fury of months broke loose in Philip.</p>

  <p>"What the hell business is that of yours?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"So far as you are concerned," was the cold reply, "it is neither my
  business nor my concern. There is Rosina, however, to be considered."</p>

  <p>"Philip&mdash;Matthew&mdash;" she implored, turning to each in turn,
  "please don't let us quarrel. It isn't worth it. Matthew is quite right to
  go, if he feels that he must. We shall get along somehow."</p>

  <p>"I shall be curious to know how," Matthew observed.</p>

  <p>Philip slid from the sofa on to his feet, and stood by Rosina's side. He
  glowered at Matthew across the table.</p>

  <p>"Damn you and your curiosity!" he exclaimed. "We sha'n't ask you for alms,
  anyhow."</p>

  <p>"So far as you are concerned," Matthew assured him, "I should refuse you
  if you did. If ever you should come to your senses and be willing to start
  work at the bottom, as a junior clerk in a commercial house, I would do my
  best to find you a post. I should do this for you for old association's sake,
  but somewhat against my principles. As regards Rosina, the matter is
  different. If she chooses to come with me, she can have the shelter of my
  flat and food when she requires it. I have no doubt that she will be able to
  earn enough for her clothes, if she has only herself to think of."</p>

  <p>A deep flush stained Philip's cheek. For a moment it seemed as though he
  would have sprung at his persecutor. Rosina linked her arm in his.</p>

  <p>"Matthew, you are horrid!" she exclaimed indignantly. "Philip will soon be
  earning far more than I ever could. I am only too proud if I can help until
  that time comes."</p>

  <p>Matthew shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You must make your own choice, Rosina," he said. "If you come with me,
  you certainly will not starve, you will have a roof over your head, and you
  will not need to pawn your clothes. If you decide to stay with
  Philip&mdash;well, God help you both!"</p>

  <p>Rosina still clung to Philip.</p>

  <p>"I dare say your offer is more kindly meant than it sounds, so I will
  thank you for it, Matthew," she declared. "Nothing, however, would induce me
  to leave Philip. I shall stay with him until he sends me away."</p>

  <p>There was nothing in Matthew's face or manner to suggest that he was
  disappointed. He had at no time adopted any other tone than one of
  condescending invitation. Yet his silence was, in a way, ominous. He looked
  at the two for a moment with an unfathomable expression. Then he turned away
  and rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"What's that for?" Philip demanded.</p>

  <p>"I am going to have Mrs. Heath up," Matthew replied, "and acquit myself of
  all responsibility here. The flat I have taken is a service flat, and I
  entered into possession to-day. After I have explained matters to Mrs. Heath,
  I shall pack my bag and move in."</p>

  <p>"Must you hurry away like this?" Rosina pleaded, a little timidly. "There
  are some socks of yours I haven't finished darning, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You can come round to my rooms and finish them whenever you like,"
  Matthew interrupted. "My address will be 130a Bury Street."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Heath bustled into the room. She was a thin, nervous woman, with a
  hard face, plentifully lined, and little untidy wisps of grey hair which
  seemed to defy restraint. She held her head a little on one side when she was
  listening, and she generally stood with her hands hanging down in front of
  her. It was understood that she had once been in service as a lady
  housekeeper.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Heath," Matthew began, "I must apologise for disturbing you at this
  hour, but there is a little matter I should like to put straight with
  you."</p>

  <p>"It's a cruel number of stairs just to answer a bell," Mrs. Heath
  complained, "but I am here."</p>

  <p>"My two friends and I are parting company," Matthew continued. "I have
  paid my rent up to last Saturday. I now wish to pay you my share until
  Saturday week, as I am leaving without notice."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Heath extended her hand for the money which Matthew was counting
  out&mdash;a greedy hand, with bony fingers and big knuckles.</p>

  <p>"If you paid for last week, I haven't had the money, sir," she declared
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Then you must settle with these two," Matthew said. "I have paid my
  share, and that is an end of it so far as I am concerned. I am leaving
  to-night. You have no further claim upon me."</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure about that," she grumbled. "It's a sudden business, this,
  to throw the rooms on my hands."</p>

  <p>"But we are staying," Rosina interposed. "Mr. Garth and I will keep the
  rooms on&mdash;except Mr. Garner's, of course."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Heath coughed.</p>

  <p>"Is the young gentleman in regular work, might I ask," she enquired, "or
  you, miss?"</p>

  <p>Rosina checked the impatient exclamation which had sprung to Philip's
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Garth is an author," she explained. "He does not need a regular post
  to be earning money. As you know, I have a little coming in for my
  typing."</p>

  <p>"Could you make it convenient to settle for last week?" the landlady
  persisted.</p>

  <p>Rosina shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Not to-night, Mrs. Heath," she confessed.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Heath took a gloomy view of the situation.</p>

  <p>"I likes my lodgers," she announced, "to be in regular work&mdash;so much
  a week coming in for certain&mdash;and then we all knows where we are. But
  putting that aside, miss, may I ask if you and the young gentleman were
  thinking of living on here alone together like?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," Rosina answered, with wide-open eyes. "Mr. Garner has just
  told you that he is going."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Heath's cough appeared to become more troublesome.</p>

  <p>"Without wishing to make myself in any way unpleasant," she said, "I
  simply puts it to you that you can't have the rooms. Mine's a respectable
  lodging house, and always has been."</p>

  <p>Rosina was genuinely bewildered.</p>

  <p>"But whatever do you mean, Mrs. Heath?" she exclaimed. "We are perfectly
  respectable people. We can get references, if you like."</p>

  <p>"It isn't a matter of references," was the dogged reply. "I don't wish to
  make insinuations, being an honest and a careful woman myself, but I just
  tell you both that I can't let the rooms to a young man and young woman who
  aren't married, and, so far as I know, aren't thinking of it."</p>

  <p>There was a curious silence in the room. Mrs. Heath, utterly ignorant of
  the thunderbolt which she had launched, began to back towards the door.
  Matthew, with sinister interest, watched the other two. Rosina had the air of
  a child whom something has terrified. For the second time that evening, a
  jarring chord had disturbed her serenity. Some one had intruded brutally and
  insistently into the most secret chambers of her consciousness. She looked a
  little timidly, a little helplessly, towards Philip. Then her head
  disappeared in her hands. This was not a battle which she could wage. Philip,
  to whom Mrs. Heath's attitude was less amazing but quite as unexpected, did
  his best to pull himself together.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he protested stormily, "this is all nonsense! Miss Vonet and
  I were brought up together in the same house. We have lived like brother and
  sister always&mdash;the three of us have, in fact."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Heath had reached the door. With her fingers upon the handle, she
  felt quite brave.</p>

  <p>"I'm not one for insinuations, sir, as I said before," she concluded, "but
  I don't choose to let my rooms to a young lady and gentleman sharing a common
  sitting room, that aren't related. And Saturday will suit me, and if it could
  be Friday, to get a bit of cleaning done, I'd be glad. Good night, all!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Heath closed the door behind her and descended the stairs. Rosina's
  courage, proof against any ordinary disaster, seemed for the moment to have
  deserted her. She threw herself into the easy-chair and buried her face,
  still hidden by her hands, in the cushion. Philip had moved a little closer
  to Matthew.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Matthew," he said, "when you asked Mrs. Heath to come up, had
  you any idea of what she might say?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly did not think that she would consider you two very desirable
  lodgers," was the sneering reply.</p>

  <p>Philip came a little nearer still.</p>

  <p>"That isn't the point, damn you!" he continued. "We're a couple of babes
  in the wood, I suppose, but the other thing hadn't occurred to us. Had it
  occurred to you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Matthew admitted.</p>

  <p>"Then what did you mean when you asked Rosina to come and share your
  flat?" Philip demanded.</p>

  <p>There was another silence. Rosina, who had been listening, raised her
  head. Her eyes, too, filled with dawning horror, were fixed upon Matthew. The
  pent-up sobs which had been shaking her body suddenly ceased.</p>

  <p>"That is my business," Matthew answered slowly.</p>

  <p>"You have made it mine!" Philip cried furiously, striking the first blow
  of his peace-loving life.</p>

  <p>Matthew had reeled against the wall but saved himself from falling. He
  stood for a moment wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth. He made no
  effort to return the blow, nor did Philip repeat it. Presently he hung his
  overcoat over his arm, picked up his hat and left the room, without a glance
  at either of them. Philip, who had been standing with clenched fists,
  watching him, listened until the sound of his retreating footsteps died away.
  Then he turned towards Rosina. In her eyes he seemed suddenly glorified. His
  passionate action, although subsequently, in her saner moments, she believed
  it ill-deserved, had somehow purged away the ugliness of the moment. He was
  the Sir Galahad of her dreams, on fire to stamp out the shadow of evil for
  her sake. She held out her arms and Philip sank down by her side. A species
  of exaltation was upon him.</p>

  <p>"Dear Rosina," he whispered, "I hadn't meant to say a word yet&mdash;not
  until I had done something in the world&mdash;not until I had something to
  offer you. And now I can't help it. Perhaps it is the one thing needed to
  keep me going, to give me faith and hope."</p>

  <p>Her arms held him tighter. They were both very young for the love which
  gathered them into its marvellous keeping&mdash;hers, in those early moments,
  perhaps, something of the mother love that desires to protect and encourage
  one a little weaker than herself. But it was very wonderful, and the magic of
  it lasted until they heard the bell of the Parish Church chiming the hour of
  eleven. Then Philip tore himself away, picked up his cap with a little laugh
  and showed her the shilling.</p>

  <p>"For my night's lodging, sweetheart!" he exclaimed, as he made his way
  towards the door. "Wish me luck."</p>

  <p>She called out after him, wanting to pack him a bag, reminding him of his
  sponges, pyjamas&mdash;all sorts of things he ought to have. There was no
  reply save the sound of his rapid footsteps descending the narrow stairs. She
  hurried to the window, watched him emerge from the shabby house, watched him
  cross the street. There was something new about him, new about his carriage,
  new about the way he held his head and swung his arms. Her heart beat with
  joy and pride as she looked downwards. For the first time, he was facing life
  like a victor.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="a-7"
     name="a-7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">So, in the eighth month of their great enterprise, the
  enterprise which was to show them the whole earth and the glory thereof, the
  three were separated. Matthew flourished in his flat in Bury Street, and,
  subject to the ministrations of a vigilant valet, departed each day for the
  city, garbed and tended into the likeness of the class into whose ranks he
  was determined to pass. Philip found a top room in an old building in Adam
  Street, a steep climb, but an airy chamber with a three-cornered view of the
  river. Rosina procured a bedroom which was little better than a cubicle, in a
  working-girl's club, thereby achieving a disagreeable but obvious
  respectability. Philip, having at last run to earth his friend's friend, the
  editor, succeeded in selling him two stories and an article, and faced the
  world bravely with nine guineas, paid, after many protests, in advance of
  publication. Rosina, at the end of her second week, parted with her coat
  again, and, at the beginning of the fourth, decided to give up typewriting
  for ever. She had what Philip lacked&mdash;a singularly robust vein of common
  sense&mdash;and she faced the situation without alarm but at the same time
  seriously, absolutely determined that under no consideration whatever would
  she become a drag upon Philip. One by one, she enumerated and considered the
  various means by which a young woman of moderate ability and rather too
  prepossessing an appearance might make a living in London. She decided to
  apply for a position in an office, and, after a prolonged study of various
  advertisements, she started out one morning with a list in her hand. To a
  certain extent she was prepared to sacrifice her independence. The idea of
  spending the day in an office was distasteful to her, but it was obviously
  inevitable. She put away regrets and faced the situation cheerfully.</p>

  <p>On her way towards the first place on her list, she paused for a moment to
  look at the bills outside the Garrick Theatre. A forthcoming production was
  announced, and the front of the house was closed. A thin stream of girls and
  men was making its way down the flagged passage which led to the stage door,
  and she chanced to overhear the word "rehearsal." With a little laugh and a
  valiant instinct for adventure, she turned and followed them. As luck would
  have it, the doorkeeper's attention was momentarily engaged as she passed in
  single file, with several other girls, before his glass window. She followed
  them down a network of dark passages, past several doors on which cards were
  pinned, until she stood at last in what she realised must be the wings of the
  theatre. Here she had a few minutes in which to collect herself. A young man
  and a girl were standing in the middle of the stage. A short,
  olive-complexioned, fat personage, with jet-black hair, was walking around
  them, with a typescript in his hand, apparently on the brink of tears.</p>

  <p>"Rotten!" he cried. "Absolutely rotten! You both enter as though you were
  walking on stilts, you both say the wrong thing in the wrong way. You, Eric,
  look like a poop-stick, and you, Madge, like a hairdresser's dummy. God help
  the play and all of us, I say! Unless you can put a little more life into it,
  you'll be booed off the stage on the first night."</p>

  <p>Rosina, thoroughly enjoying herself, smiled at a pleasant-faced young man
  in tweeds, who was standing by her side, smoking a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Are these two really so bad," she enquired, "or is it the play?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's scarcely fair to ask me," he replied, "as I happen to be the
  author."</p>

  <p>Rosina, who was becoming an opportunist, did not hesitate for a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"Are you really the author?" she murmured, raising her eyes and looking at
  him. "How wonderful!"</p>

  <p>The young man changed his position a little. He seemed slightly
  embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know about that!" he observed deprecatingly. "This sort of
  thing isn't really difficult to write."</p>

  <p>"I heard the little fat man say something about a chorus," she went on,
  dropping her voice a little and looking at him confidentially. "Do you think
  I could possibly find a place in it?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you in the show?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," she answered hopefully.</p>

  <p>"Then what the dickens are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>"I just saw the others coming in and I followed," she explained. "I was on
  my way to apply for a post at a fruit shop, at two pounds ten a week. I would
  so much rather go on the stage."</p>

  <p>The young man turned and studied her attentively. After all, she decided,
  he was not quite so young as she had thought at first. He was a little
  freckled and very much sunburnt, clean-shaven, bald on the top of his head,
  with humorous mouth and kindly grey eyes. She liked him quite well enough to
  endure his scrutiny and to smile back at him.</p>

  <p>"Sure you're not getting at me?" he demanded. "You're not a leading
  ing&eacute;nue in disguise, or anything of that sort?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the kind," she assured him. "I am a poor but honest girl,
  seeking to make a respectable living."</p>

  <p>The rehearsal was in full swing now. The young man called to his
  confederate who had been coaching the unhappy pair.</p>

  <p>"Sam," he said, "a word with you."</p>

  <p>Sam strolled over, fanning himself with the script he was carrying.</p>

  <p>"No use pitching into me, Duggie, old chap," he began, deprecatingly.
  "I'll teach them their job in time, but it's damned slow work."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to pitch into you," was the prompt reply. "Is your chorus
  full up?"</p>

  <p>"Abso-bally-lutely!"</p>

  <p>Rosina's heart fell like a stone. Her hopes rose again, however, a moment
  later.</p>

  <p>"Then just forget it," the author enjoined firmly. "Sam, old fellow, as a
  pal, couldn't you run another one in?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God, Douglas!" the stage manager groaned. "Where is it? Let me
  know the worst!"</p>

  <p>"The worst, in this case, is the best," was the cheerful rejoinder. "Sam,
  shake hands with Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Miss&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Miss Vonet," Rosina intervened. "How do you do, Mr. Sam? I hope you'll
  let me come into the chorus, and that you won't be as cross with me as you
  were with those people just now."</p>

  <p>The stage manager shook hands, coldly at first but with increasing warmth.
  Rosina had looked at him.</p>

  <p>"Duggie," he remonstrated, "why didn't you bring the young lady along
  before?"</p>

  <p>"She's only just at liberty," the other explained. "Had hard work to
  persuade her to come into a rotten show like this."</p>

  <p>"Better late than never, Miss Vonet," the stage manager declared.
  "Rehearsal at two-thirty this afternoon. You get a fiver a week when we
  start, if we ever do. We find the clothes. Don't be late."</p>

  <p>The author looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Time we went and had some lunch, Miss Vonet," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Grillroom at Ciro's," he interrupted. "I know what you're going to
  say&mdash;old clothes on, and all that. It doesn't matter a bit. Come
  along."</p>

  <p>He led the way into the street. Rosina walked demurely by his side.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I'm not going to refuse a perfectly good lunch," she said, "if
  you think it really doesn't matter about my terrible clothes. But will you
  kindly tell me if you really are the author of the play, and what it's all
  about?"</p>

  <p>"My name is Douglas Erwen," he announced. "I am a New Yorker, although I
  am over on this side a good deal. To a certain extent I wrote the play, but
  it's one of those silly affairs, you know, with a skeleton plot, a slight
  book, plenty of songs and dances, and a dickens of a lot of gag. They call me
  the author," he went on meditatively. "I suppose I do supply them with an
  idea or two as a peg to hang the rest on. I certainly don't do more."</p>

  <p>"What have I to do in the chorus?" Rosina enquired.</p>

  <p>"Kind of go-as-you-please," Erwen assured her. "Stroll about most of the
  time in wonderful clothes, and make imaginary conversation with sticky-faced
  young men."</p>

  <p>"I sha'n't like it," Rosina declared firmly.</p>

  <p>"I never supposed you would," was the gloomy reply. "All the same, if you
  want to get on the stage, it's a start."</p>

  <p>"It isn't the stage I'm so keen about," she confided. "It's the five
  pounds a week."</p>

  <p>"Honest?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I've been earning fifteen shillings a week by typing," she told him. "I
  couldn't keep myself on it, so I've spent all my savings."</p>

  <p>"Haven't you any home or relatives?" he asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"None!"</p>

  <p>"No friends?"</p>

  <p>"One&mdash;a young man whom I am by way of being engaged to. He is very
  clever, but unfortunately he hasn't any money, either."</p>

  <p>"Where do you live?"</p>

  <p>"At a girls' hostel in Westminster. It costs just twenty-four shillings a
  week. When one's earnings are fifteen&mdash;well, living becomes rather a
  problem, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>They passed through the swing doors, into the restaurant. The young man
  wrote his companion's name in a book, handed his stick and hat to an
  attendant, and led her down the stairs, past the bar, from which he was
  vociferously greeted by its various patrons, into a quaintly-decorated
  grillroom, where he ensconced Rosina at a corner table and took a seat beside
  her.</p>

  <p>"Cocktail?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"I've never tasted one," she confessed. "I think I'd rather not, if you
  don't mind. I mustn't try too many new experiences in one day."</p>

  <p>He ordered one for himself, consulted her taste as to the luncheon and
  selected some light wine. All the time he was studying her, unobtrusively and
  in quite friendly fashion.</p>

  <p>"Say, are you used to lunching with perfect strangers?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I have never done it before," she assured him, "but then, you see, I have
  never met a real author who found me a place at five pounds a week and asked
  me out to lunch as well."</p>

  <p>"We are not all to be trusted," he warned her. "Terrible fellows, some of
  us!"</p>

  <p>She smiled into his face. When she smiled, Rosina was very beautiful.</p>

  <p>"I should always trust you," she said.</p>

  <p>"I hope you always may," he answered, without over-much warmth in his
  tone. "Rather like putting one on honour, though, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"It is very good for you to be put on honour," she declared.&mdash;"What a
  wonderful omelette! Tell me, have you written many plays?"</p>

  <p>"A fair number," he admitted. "Most of them have found their way over to
  this side, too. Don't tell me that you have never seen one of them!"</p>

  <p>"Seen one of them?" she repeated, with a little laugh. "Why, I've only
  been in a theatre once in my life. It was one of Shakespeare's plays, and we
  had to leave early so that my uncle shouldn't find out."</p>

  <p>"Say, you're not pulling my leg, are you?" he asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Everything I have told you has been the honest truth," she assured
  him.</p>

  <p>"Where have you been living, then?"</p>

  <p>"Norchester. Doesn't that explain it?"</p>

  <p>"Somewhere up in the north, isn't it? But surely you came to London
  sometimes?"</p>

  <p>"Never! My guardian was a strict Nonconformist."</p>

  <p>"Look here," Erwen exclaimed, waving his hand across the room, "I must
  introduce you to Reggie! He looks stupid but he isn't. You will see a lot of
  him at the theatre. He's putting up the money for the show. Hi, Reggie!"</p>

  <p>A sleepy-looking young man, whose chief characteristics seemed to be a
  rather fat face, an unattached monocle and a friendly manner, strolled across
  to them.</p>

  <p>"Want you to shake hands with Miss Vonet," Erwen declared. "Lord Reginald
  Towers&mdash;Miss Vonet. Miss Vonet has kindly consented to join the company
  at present rehearsing at the Garrick Theatre."</p>

  <p>"In other words, she's in the show, what?" the newcomer observed, with
  some appearance of interest. "Good business! Where were you last, Miss Vonet?
  I haven't met you before, have I?"</p>

  <p>"I come from Norchester," Rosina replied, "and I don't think you've ever
  been there."</p>

  <p>"Norchester?" the young man repeated, a little vaguely. "One of those
  funny places up on the top side of the map, isn't it? I meant, what was your
  last show?"</p>

  <p>"I have never been on the stage before," Rosina confided.</p>

  <p>"Done any filming?"</p>

  <p>"None."</p>

  <p>"Absolute ing&eacute;nue, what?" Lord Reginald remarked. "Very clever of
  Duggie to find you, I'm sure. Glad we're going to meet at the theatre, Miss
  Vonet. So long. I'm what you might call booked to lunch with the Lollipop
  sisters," he added, strolling off to join a little party at the other end of
  the room.</p>

  <p>"My first meeting with a lord," Rosina reflected, gazing after the
  retreating figure with interest.</p>

  <p>"He's none too bright a specimen of the genus, I'm afraid," Erwen
  remarked. "A good fellow enough in some respects, but a rotter with women.
  Keep him in his place, Miss Vonet, won't you?"</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"What is his place?"</p>

  <p>"A good arm's-length away from you, and then some," was the prompt
  reply.</p>

  <p>"I'll remember it," she promised.</p>

  <p>"He'll ask you to lunch," Erwen warned her.</p>

  <p>"I won't go. That's real self-denial, for I don't often get a meal like
  this."</p>

  <p>"You shall lunch with me as often as you like," he invited.</p>

  <p>"How do I know that you are to be trusted?" she asked, smiling.</p>

  <p>"You will discover that in time," he declared confidently. "Meanwhile,
  will you have some coffee?"</p>

  <p>"Have I time?" she asked. "I don't want to be late."</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Plenty," he assured her, as he gave the order. "Now look here, Miss
  Vonet, let me give you a word of advice. Seriously, I think you will have had
  enough of the stage in a week or two, which is about as long as this thing
  will run, but in the meantime, be careful of them all across yonder. They're
  a little accustomed to take liberties with strangers, and they aren't a very
  understanding lot."</p>

  <p>"I don't think any one is likely to take much notice of me, but I will be
  careful," Rosina promised, as she drank her coffee hurriedly. "Do you mind if
  I rush away now? I'm so anxious not to be late the first time. Don't bother
  to come upstairs with me, please," she added, as her companion showed signs
  of accompanying her. "You haven't finished your coffee yet. I can find my way
  quite well. And thank you once more for this wonderful lunch."</p>

  <p>Erwen remained on his feet for a moment or two, watching her. Rosina, in
  spite of the privations of the last few months, seemed to have grown more
  beautiful every day since her arrival in London. Her complexion was
  exquisitely clear, and, with her slightly increased fragility, her eyes
  seemed to have grown larger and more lustrous. Not even her closely fitting
  hat&mdash;a very inexpensive little affair it was&mdash;could conceal the
  coils of silky, golden-brown hair; and, notwithstanding her shabby clothes
  and clumsy shoes, she carried herself with a quiet grace, an indefinable
  elegance, which attracted the attention of several of the lunchers seated at
  the tables around the door. She glanced back, smiled at Erwen, and went on
  her way unruffled. She thanked the man who pushed open the revolving door for
  her with such a smile that he looked after her, astonished. The smile
  lingered on her lips as she stepped out of the place and turned towards the
  theatre. She was on the threshold of adventure at last!</p>

  <p>Back in the grillroom at Ciro's, Erwen was talking through the telephone
  to Sam Benson, the excitable little man whom he had introduced to Rosina.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Sam," he said, "about that little girl I asked you to take on
  this morning. She's on her way over to rehearse now."</p>

  <p>"You don't want me to give her a part, I hope?" the stage manager asked
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Don't be an ass! She's never been on the stage before and I dare say
  she'll be a perfect stick. I just want you to be on the lookout and see that
  none of the fellows get fresh with her over there."</p>

  <p>"That's all right, Duggie, old chap," the other promised, in a tone of
  relief. "Leave it to me. I'll look after her."</p>

  <p>"And, say, don't bully her yourself, there's a good fellow. Remember that
  the great Sarah herself had to have a first showing. And listen here, Sam.
  Tell her she's paid for rehearsals, and give her a fiver on Friday. I'll
  settle up with you."</p>

  <p>"I'll attend to it. See you later."</p>

  <p>Erwen returned to his seat and sipped his liqueur brandy. Having
  registered a solemn vow, in face of the whole company, that nothing should
  drag him to rehearsal again until the following week, he was wondering now
  what excuse he could make for breaking his word.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="a-8"
     name="a-8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was a day of wonderful happenings for Rosina. She reached
  home at about six o'clock to find a brief but excited note from Philip. The
  editor had materialised. He was a friendly person and was anxious to meet
  Rosina. They were to dine together that night at Romano's at a quarter to
  eight. Rosina must be there, without fail. There was a Treasury note enclosed
  in the letter, in case any of the small details of her toilette needed
  replenishing. The tears were in Rosina's eyes as she stuffed it into a corner
  of her purse, to be returned to Philip during the evening.</p>

  <p>She spent the next hour making slight alterations to the one frock which
  represented her evening wardrobe. It was a task for which she had a peculiar
  aptitude, and even Philip looked at her with surprise as, a few minutes
  before the appointed time, she advanced towards them through the little
  throng waiting about in the vestibule of Romano's. The editor metaphorically
  rubbed his eyes. It was as though sunshine had been let into the rather
  gloomy place.</p>

  <p>"Philip," she exclaimed, as she passed her arm through his, "I can't tell
  you how delighted I was to get your note! Here I am, you see, punctual and
  hungry. Is this Mr. Homan?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Mark Homan&mdash;Miss Vonet," Philip murmured. "Shall we go upstairs?
  We thought it would be quieter there."</p>

  <p>They moved off towards the staircase. From a picturesque point of view,
  Mr. Homan was a disappointment. He was small, almost under-sized, his sandy
  hair was streaked with grey, his eyes were weak, his linen not altogether
  irreproachable, and his coat needed brushing. Rosina, however, took no heed
  of these things. He was the wonderful person who had bought two of Philip's
  stories and set him on the way to fortune. That was all that mattered.</p>

  <p>"Philip tells me that you are starting a new magazine," she said, as they
  mounted the stairs together, "and that you have bought two of his stories. I
  can't tell you how glad I am. Of course, you'll think that I'm prejudiced,
  but they are good, aren't they?"</p>

  <p>"Very fair stuff indeed," Mr. Homan assented. "He'll do all right if he
  doesn't try to fly before he can walk."</p>

  <p>"You mean you think that he is a little too ambitious?"</p>

  <p>They were ushered to their table. Mr. Homan, as giver of the feast, sat
  between the two young people.</p>

  <p>"I mean," he explained to Rosina, "that it's no use writing what the class
  of people he writes for don't understand. He must choose his subjects
  according to popular demand, and then he'll get along all right. A good
  series of detective stories, now, is what every magazine in London is looking
  for."</p>

  <p>"But I don't want to encourage Mr. Garth to write detective stories,"
  Rosina observed, with a little grimace. "I don't like them."</p>

  <p>"That is where you are unlike several millions of magazine readers," Mr.
  Homan rejoined drily. "One must study the larger public. A great deal of Mr.
  Garth's work is too fanciful for us."</p>

  <p>"There is a market for it, though, isn't there?" Rosina asked timidly.</p>

  <p>"There is," the editor admitted, "but, if you will forgive my saying so,
  it is a market which brings him into competition with a great many writers of
  larger experience."</p>

  <p>"I've decided to put my novel away for a time and try a detective story,"
  Philip announced.</p>

  <p>Rosina tried not to look disappointed.</p>

  <p>"I love the novel," she said simply.</p>

  <p>"I'll finish it some day," Philip promised, "but meantime one must live.
  Mr. Homan has paid me in advance for two stories, as you know, Rosina, and he
  has agreed to take a series of detective stories&mdash;six or even eight of
  them&mdash;if I can hit upon an original idea."</p>

  <p>"It is very kind of Mr. Homan," Rosina declared gratefully. "I wish it
  were some other sort of work, but I am quite sure that you will be able to
  get an original idea, Philip, and, as Mr. Homan says, if the public wants
  detective stories, I suppose it must have them."</p>

  <p>"There is a great deal of fiction about nowadays," Mr. Homan observed.
  "Tons of it in the post every day. I don't know when I shall have time to
  read the manuscripts I have waiting in my office now&mdash;some good, some
  bad, mostly indifferent."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to call your new magazine, Mr. Homan?" Rosina
  enquired.</p>

  <p>"'Homan's Monthly,'" the editor replied. "I didn't want to associate my
  own name with it particularly, but I couldn't think of anything else. We
  sha'n't cut much of a splash as regards paper and illustrations and that sort
  of thing. We've got to produce a medium-priced article in a medium-class way.
  It's an age of mediocre things, you know, Miss Vonet."</p>

  <p>"Philip's work isn't mediocre, is it?" she asked, a little ruefully.</p>

  <p>"I think I am justified in saying that it is slightly better than
  mediocre," Mr. Homan conceded. "To be candid with you, the writing is very
  crude at times, and the proof reader may have to use his pencil here and
  there. But the stuff itself is all right. Do you follow any profession or are
  you in business, Miss Vonet?"</p>

  <p>Rosina launched her thunderbolt.</p>

  <p>"I am on the stage," she announced.</p>

  <p>"On the stage?" Mr. Homan repeated, with some surprise.</p>

  <p>"On the stage?" Philip gasped.</p>

  <p>"Since this morning," she explained. "I am in the chorus of a new play to
  be produced at the Garrick, written by Mr. Douglas Erwen."</p>

  <p>"What on earth are you talking about, Rosina?" Philip demanded.</p>

  <p>She smiled radiantly across the table at him.</p>

  <p>"It is quite true," she assured him. "My good fortune has followed very
  soon after yours. We need neither of us envy Matthew any more. I never
  thought that I could feel quite so happy."</p>

  <p>She leaned back to listen to the music for a moment. Philip was suddenly
  conscious of the fact&mdash;which people at the adjoining tables had already
  realised&mdash;that, with this glow of happiness upon her face and shining
  out of her eyes, Rosina was adorably beautiful. A curious and indefinable
  wave of jealousy assailed him.</p>

  <p>"Tell me exactly how you got them to try you at the Garrick?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>Rosina left off nodding her head to the music and leaned forward once
  more.</p>

  <p>"I followed a little crowd into rehearsal at the theatre," she said. "It
  was all quite by chance, for I was on my way up the Charing Cross Road to try
  for an awful post at a fruiterer's shop. I got on to the back of the stage,
  somehow&mdash;all the girls have told me since that I was very lucky, as the
  doorkeeper would never have let me pass if he had seen me&mdash;and I found
  myself standing next to a very nice-looking man who seemed as though he had
  something to do with the show, and I asked him if he thought I could get a
  place in the chorus. He looked at me as though I were mad, at first, and
  then, after we had talked for a few minutes, he sent for the stage manager
  and said that they were to try me. And that isn't all."</p>

  <p>"Go on," Philip insisted.</p>

  <p>"The nice man turned out to be Mr. Douglas Erwen, the author of the play,"
  she concluded triumphantly, "and he took me to lunch in the grillroom at
  Ciro's."</p>

  <p>Philip's face darkened.</p>

  <p>"Took you to lunch?" he repeated. "You went with him&mdash;a
  stranger?"</p>

  <p>Rosina laughed gaily. There was a flash of anxiety in her eyes, however,
  as she noticed the deepening frown on Philip's forehead.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly, dear," she begged. "Remember that, but for him, I should
  never have got a chance, and he was quite charming. There were all sorts of
  amusing people down in the grillroom. He introduced me to a fat young man who
  is a lord, and who is finding the money to produce the play, and, after I had
  left, he telephoned to the theatre to tell them to help me as much as
  possible. I am going to have five pounds a week, and what I have to do is
  quite simple and easy."</p>

  <p>"An exceedingly fortunate start, I should say," Mr. Homan murmured
  sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"Did you see anything more of Mr. Erwen afterwards?" Philip asked
  coldly.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," Rosina replied. "They told me he wasn't expected to come
  to any more rehearsals until next week. I thought you'd be so glad," she
  added appealingly, looking across the table at Philip.</p>

  <p>"You ought not to have lunched with the fellow," he declared, a little
  sullenly.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear, why not?" Rosina protested. "It was all so natural, and,
  when he asked me, it never entered into my head to refuse. As a matter of
  fact, I was ridiculously hungry, and I had only fourpence in my
  purse&mdash;not that that mattered, of course&mdash;I could easily have
  borrowed some," she added quickly, noticing Philip's sensitive start.
  "Anyhow, I did lunch with him and I loved it, and he was delightful. Don't be
  cross, Philip, there's a dear."</p>

  <p>"I am not in the least cross," Philip assured her stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Very popular fellow, Douglas Erwen," Mr. Homan observed, with some idea
  of making a tactful interposition. "Must have made a lot of money with his
  plays, too, especially in the States. He is an American, you know."</p>

  <p>"I hate Americans," Philip muttered.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't hate Mr. Erwen," Rosina said quietly, "because he is an
  exceedingly nice man."</p>

  <p>The meal continued to its appointed end, but the glamour of it had gone.
  Rosina more than once asked herself if it were really true that this was, or
  should have been, the most wonderful evening of her life. Philip and she had
  passed at a single step from dire poverty to the land of promise. They were
  dining with an editor who had it in his power to make Philip famous, the
  orchestra was playing a beautiful selection from "Madame Butterfly", she
  herself had made a wonderful start in a new and most attractive profession.
  They should both have been riotously hilarious, instead of which her little
  efforts at rejoicing were counteracted by Philip's stolid silence. He
  mellowed a little with his last glass of wine, and she noticed with concern
  that he drank two liqueurs, one after the other. Mr. Homan followed suit,
  only rather more quickly, and they sent for the bottle back again.</p>

  <p>"Can I come back with you for a few minutes and tidy up your room?" she
  asked, looking across at Philip with a wonderful little smile upon her
  lips.</p>

  <p>Philip hesitated and glanced across at their host.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not to-night, Rosina," he replied. "Mr. Homan has promised to
  take me to a little club he belongs to."</p>

  <p>"A club?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"The Junior Writers'," Mr. Homan intervened. "It's quite a decent little
  place, with a strong literary atmosphere. I thought it might be useful for
  Garth to join. I'm on the committee and I could get him in quickly."</p>

  <p>"Why, of course," she assented. "I think it would be splendid. Only," she
  added, trying to choke something back in her throat, "I thought that just
  to-night, perhaps&mdash;but that's quite silly. Do take him to the club, Mr.
  Homan. I think it will be wonderful for Philip to meet some fellow authors
  and journalists."</p>

  <p>"I can take you home first, if you like," Philip suggested, a little
  dubiously.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't think of it," she insisted. "You go to the club with Mr.
  Homan now; then you won't have to stay too late. If you let me have your key,
  I'll go and tidy up for you and leave it under the mat."</p>

  <p>Philip handed it across to her.</p>

  <p>"Sure you don't mind?" he asked, a little shame-facedly.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit. Perhaps&mdash;will you walk downstairs with me, dear?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Homan was paying the bill, and Philip rose to his feet at once and
  followed her. She thrust her arm through his directly they reached the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>"Philip, dear," she said, "I am sorry if I did wrong in lunching with Mr.
  Erwen. You won't be cross with me any more, will you?"</p>

  <p>"No," he promised magnanimously.</p>

  <p>"And, dear," she went on, holding his arm tightly, "Mr. Homan's ever so
  nice, and I love him for buying your stories, but he does drink rather a
  great deal, doesn't he? You will be careful, please?"</p>

  <p>"I can take care of myself, thanks," he answered. "Don't you worry about
  me, Rosina."</p>

  <p>"Shall I see you to-morrow?" she asked wistfully. "I am rehearsing morning
  and afternoon, but I shall be free in the evening."</p>

  <p>"I'll come round," he promised.</p>

  <p>She made her adieux to Mr. Homan, who joined them at that moment, crossed
  the street not altogether happily, and made her way to the gloomy building at
  the top of which Philip's room was situated. She climbed the five flights of
  stone stairs, let herself in with a little sigh to his bare, untidy room,
  tucked up her skirt and set to work to clean it methodically. Then, by the
  light of the oil lamp, she went through his clothes, mended some socks,
  fastened some loose buttons on his shirts, filled the kettle and set it on
  the spirit stove for his breakfast in the morning, and finally wrote him a
  few hasty, affectionate lines, slipping the Treasury note which he had sent
  her into the envelope. Afterwards, she walked back to her own room, along the
  Embankment. Memories of their first day in London crowded inevitably into her
  mind. There was a touch of salt in the wind, blowing against the tide, a
  pleasant freshness in the air. Her spirits began to rise. After all, Philip's
  little fit of jealousy was such a trifling affair. And as for the rest, it
  was absolutely necessary for his work that he should keep friends with Mr.
  Homan. The idea of a club, too, where he would meet other men who wrote, was
  wonderful. She decided that her disappointment was entirely selfish, and by
  the time she had reached her own little apartment, comfortless though it was,
  she had altogether regained her spirits. She undressed and went to bed
  happily enough, humming softly to herself fragments of the music which had
  drifted to her through the smoke-hung restaurant.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="a-9"
     name="a-9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was, perhaps, the most complete surprise of his life when
  Benjamin Stone, arrived in London to interview a representative of the great
  firm who had been his largest customers for over twenty years, was ushered
  into one of the private offices to find Matthew seated in the chair of
  authority.</p>

  <p>"Matthew!" he exclaimed. "Matthew Garner!"</p>

  <p>Words refused to carry him any further. He stood grasping his hat in one
  hand and his umbrella in the other, gazing at this square-faced, self-assured
  young man who was leaning complacently back in his swivel chair.</p>

  <p>"Yes, this is Matthew, all right," was the unhesitating reply. "Sit down,
  won't you? Bit of a shock seeing me here, I expect."</p>

  <p>"A considerable shock," Benjamin Stone acknowledged, taking a chair and
  depositing his hat and umbrella upon the floor. "I did not even know that you
  were employed by this firm, much less that you were in a position to occupy a
  room in which I have generally been received by one of the senior
  partners."</p>

  <p>"I offered these people my services a few days after I arrived in London,"
  Matthew announced. "They took me on at three pounds ten a week. I have had
  three small rises since, and a large one recently. If I decide to stay, I
  shall be a partner in two years' time."</p>

  <p>Benjamin eyed his connection impassively.</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt that you are telling the truth," he said. "I never
  doubted your ability."</p>

  <p>"Not even down at Norchester?"</p>

  <p>"Not even at Norchester."</p>

  <p>"Pity you didn't show a little more confidence in me, then," Matthew
  observed. "If you had adopted the suggestions I put forward eighteen months
  ago, the business of Benjamin Stone and Company would be in a sounder
  position than it is to-day."</p>

  <p>"That is your opinion."</p>

  <p>"It is my carefully considered opinion."</p>

  <p>"And what reasons have you, may I ask," the older man continued, "for
  assuming that business is not so good with me as it was?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, one hears things," Matthew replied, with a shrug of the shoulders. "I
  was down in Norchester a few weeks ago."</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" was the cold rejoinder. "You did not honour me by a visit."</p>

  <p>"Why should I? You have been my guardian, but I have little enough to
  thank you for. I earned all that you gave me in the factory, and a little
  more. I don't feel under any obligation to you, and when I think what a
  miserable time we all three had at Sion House, with your hard living, and
  prayers, and foolish strictness, I can't say that I feel any particular
  friendliness towards you."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone looked steadily at his late ward from underneath his grey,
  bushy eyebrows for several moments without speaking. A very close observer
  might have fancied that his unmoved demeanour was not entirely
  natural&mdash;that he had, in effect, flinched a little at the cold
  callousness of the young man's words.</p>

  <p>"My house," he said slowly, "was conducted in your time as it is
  now&mdash;on Christian principles and according to my lights. There was no
  self-indulgence, I admit. I held it my duty to see that there was no
  opportunity for anything of the sort. I tried to bring you up as children of
  the Lord."</p>

  <p>Matthew shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"That sort of thing," he observed, "is a little out of date. However, I
  must not forget that you are here to-day to talk business."</p>

  <p>"Surely not with you?" Benjamin Stone demanded.</p>

  <p>"With me, if anybody," was the self-satisfied reply. "As a matter of fact,
  I am fully empowered to deal with you. Mr. Faringdon is hunting to-day, Mr.
  Nettleby is in the south of France, and the others here are only machines.
  Besides, the boot and shoe business is my department, and I know all about
  the Norchester trade."</p>

  <p>"Supposing you let me hear what you have to say, then?" Benjamin Stone
  suggested.</p>

  <p>The young man squared his shoulders and leaned over the table.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he began, "I want you to get this into your head. You're a
  hard nut to crack, and you've kept your secret very well, but I didn't spend
  all those years in your factory for nothing. I could see how things were
  going, all the time. I understand your present position perfectly."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone remained apparently unmoved. His bushy eyebrows, however,
  were drawn a little closer together.</p>

  <p>"And what is your idea of my present position?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"Briefly, this," Matthew expounded. "I know that, so far from being the
  rich man people think, you are pretty well broke. I know that you've run that
  factory of yours on parsimonious lines to its last gasp. You've bought no new
  machinery for years. You've let every other factory in Norchester step ahead
  of you in plant and every form of labour-saving device. You may be the
  nominal owner of a lot of land, but it's all mortgaged. There are a great
  many people in Norchester who look upon you as a millionaire. I wonder what
  your bank manager thinks about it."</p>

  <p>The older man muttered something under his breath, which might have been a
  prayer or might have been some canonical form of imprecation, but of actual
  words none escaped him. He sat like a man stunned.</p>

  <p>"You see now," Matthew went on, with a little note of triumph in his harsh
  tone, "it won't be any use trying to bluff me. We can do business if you want
  to, and we can do business for cash on the nail. I know that you need the
  cash, and you know that I know it."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what your proposition is?" Benjamin Stone suggested, with
  something in his tone which might have been humility.</p>

  <p>"We're overdone with capital here," Matthew explained. "We propose to use
  some of it in manufacturing the goods we've been buying from you. We'll buy
  you out, if you like, lock, stock and barrel&mdash;all your rotten old
  machinery, your worn-out belting, your wheezy old gas engine and your
  wretched fittings. We shall probably scrap the lot, but we'll buy you out for
  cash if you're a seller."</p>

  <p>"At a valuation?" Benjamin Stone murmured.</p>

  <p>"Not likely!" the younger man scoffed. "You keep your own book debts and
  your own liabilities. We'll give you twenty thousand pounds cash for your
  stock, plant, and freehold of the factory. You can have a cheque for five
  thousand on account, before you leave here, and the balance as soon as the
  lawyers can get the papers through."</p>

  <p>"Twenty thousand pounds," Benjamin Stone repeated, in parrot-like
  fashion.</p>

  <p>"It's our one figure, first and last," was the firm reply.</p>

  <p>"I'm not attempting to bargain&mdash;at this moment, at any rate,"
  Benjamin Stone declared, after a moment's reflection, "but will you explain
  to me how it is that you are in a position to make an offer of any definite
  sum without going through my stock or having my machinery valued?"</p>

  <p>It was more than ever obvious that Matthew's eyes were a little narrow;
  also that they were set a little too closely together. The cold steadiness of
  his visitor's gaze utterly failed to disconcert him.</p>

  <p>"I have been in your factory for seven years," he replied. "I know your
  machinery by heart. I know the average amount of stock you keep, and if it
  isn't in boots and shoes, it's in leather. Anyhow, that's our offer."</p>

  <p>"I did my best," Benjamin Stone said gravely, "to bring you up honestly in
  the fear of the Lord and His Commandments. Yet you are lying to me now."</p>

  <p>"Lying?" Matthew repeated indignantly.</p>

  <p>"You were down in Norchester three weeks ago. You were there again three
  days ago. I saw my clerk, James Mulholland, leave the hotel where you were
  staying, and the figures from which you have made your offer were obtained
  from him."</p>

  <p>Matthew shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You've tumbled to it, have you?" he remarked, without a shade of
  shamefacedness. "Well, it can't be helped. All's fair in a business deal, and
  Mulholland's figures were practically according to my own ideas. The stock
  was a few thousand pounds larger than I had imagined, I must confess, but
  that's neither here nor there."</p>

  <p>"You bribed my clerk who has been with me for thirty years," Benjamin
  Stone said sternly.</p>

  <p>"It was your own fault for not paying him better," Matthew rejoined. "You
  keep the poor devil with his nose to the grindstone all his life, and after
  thirty years' work you are still paying him four pounds a week. How the devil
  do you expect him to be honest? It isn't he who is to blame for trying to
  make an odd fifty pounds when the chance comes his way. You're the culprit
  for grinding him down, for keeping him a pauper. It's your sin, not his, if
  there is any."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone showed no sign of anger. He seemed to be studying his late
  ward with a new interest.</p>

  <p>"You've learnt to think for yourself since you left Norchester," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I thought a great deal when I was there," Matthew retorted, "but it
  didn't suit me to open my mouth then. I saw pretty well what your religion
  and your professed hatred of all forms of self-indulgence stood for. It was
  just grinding, narrow miserliness, a cloak for all sorts of meanness, an
  excuse for trying to hoard your money. You kept us without pocket money for
  fear we should spend it on 'sinful indulgence.' You underpaid the work you
  made us do, for the same reason. Well, you haven't done me any harm, except
  that you've set me against the inside of a church or a chapel for the rest of
  my days. But as for the other two&mdash;well, you'd better think about them
  the next time you pray for sinners, on a horsehair sofa!"</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone leaned forward. For the first time, the hard tranquillity
  of his face seemed disturbed.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Nothing particular," Matthew replied, "except that I saw Philip drunk in
  the Strand last night. Lucky if he wasn't in the police court this
  morning."</p>

  <p>"You didn't go to his assistance, then?"</p>

  <p>Matthew laughed hardly.</p>

  <p>"Not I! Why the devil should I? I couldn't afford to get mixed up in an
  affair like that."</p>

  <p>"And Rosina?"</p>

  <p>There was a very ugly look in Matthew's face.</p>

  <p>"You are not much of a man of the world," he said, "but what did you
  suppose was likely to happen to Rosina&mdash;a pretty girl without a shilling
  to pay for her lodgings, and no one but a drunken boy to look after her? I
  saw her with a lot of chorus girls, coming out of the stage door of the
  Garrick Theatre, a few evenings ago. You can judge for yourself how much good
  your three-quarters of an hour prayers every day of our lives for all those
  years have done her!"</p>

  <p>The mask, if it were a mask, had fallen again. Benjamin Stone did not
  flinch. There was even a certain dignity in his speech.</p>

  <p>"I have done my best, according to my lights," he pronounced. "The life
  which I preached to you three who were committed to my charge is the life I
  have lived myself. I might, perhaps," he went on, after a moment's thoughtful
  hesitation, "have endeavoured to extend some further help to Philip, the
  weakest of you. I might have done this but for one thing."</p>

  <p>"And that?" Matthew asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Philip robbed me on the night before his departure," Benjamin Stone said
  sadly. "He went to the factory, on some excuse or other, and he robbed me of
  fifty pounds."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. Matthew was holding the sides of the desk at
  which he sat.</p>

  <p>"How do you know that?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I was in the factory myself," was the sorrowful reply. "I saw him there,
  saw him in the office."</p>

  <p>"Robbed you of fifty pounds," Matthew repeated. "I wonder you let him get
  away with it."</p>

  <p>"I was wrong," the other admitted. "That matter, however, does not lie
  between you and me. Our interview was to be a business one."</p>

  <p>"Twenty thousand pounds is our offer," Matthew pointed out.</p>

  <p>"I accept."</p>

  <p>Matthew was startled into some show of surprise.</p>

  <p>"You are willing to sell out, then?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I am. Draft me a rough agreement, and let me have an open cheque for that
  five thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>Matthew summoned the cashier, and the affair was brought to its natural
  conclusion. Benjamin Stone placed the cheque carefully in his pocketbook,
  rose to his feet and took up his hat and umbrella. The cashier had already
  left the room.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of curiosity," Matthew enquired, leaning back in his chair,
  "will that twenty thousand pounds, and your book debts, be sufficient to
  discharge your liabilities? It was the one point on which I found old
  Mulholland a little reticent."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone smiled a very thin smile.</p>

  <p>"With the help of the balances from my mortgaged property," he said, "I am
  hoping that it may be sufficient to spare you the disgrace of seeing a
  relative in the Bankruptcy Court. I shall remain at Smith's Temperance Hotel
  in Russell Square until the final papers are ready for my signature."</p>

  <p>"So as to get the other fifteen thousand pounds before you return to
  Norchester?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely!"</p>

  <p>"The matter shall be hurried through as quickly as possible," Matthew
  promised.</p>

  <p>There was no further speech, no attempt at any interchange of the most
  formal courtesies. Benjamin Stone simply left the room, closing the door
  behind him. He walked through the familiar offices and out into the street.
  He had the air of a man alone with his thoughts. Behind, Matthew sat reading
  the draft agreement, drinking in every word of it, a slow, cruel smile upon
  his lips. It was the first tangible triumph of his life.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="a-10"
     name="a-10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Male callers at the girls' hostel where Rosina had taken up
  her temporary abode were few and far between, and arrangements for their
  reception somewhat chilly. Rosina was called from her room about seven
  o'clock on the evening of Benjamin Stone's visit to the city, to be curtly
  informed by a severe housekeeper, who heartily disapproved of her new charge,
  that a gentleman was waiting to see her in the parlour. Rosina, who had paid
  two fruitless visits to Philip's rooms within the last twenty-four hours, did
  not trouble to enquire, even, as to whom the caller might be. She laughed
  happily, put on her discarded hat, forgot that she was tired after three
  hours' rehearsal&mdash;mostly, so far as she was concerned, standing
  about&mdash;and hurried downstairs into the stuffy little reception room to
  find Matthew, with his hands behind him, looking out of the window.</p>

  <p>"Matthew!" she exclaimed, genuinely surprised. "I never dreamed that it
  was you!"</p>

  <p>"I offered my name, but the housekeeper didn't seem to want to hear it,"
  he replied. "I don't like this room, Rosina, and I should like to talk to
  you. Will you come out and have dinner with me somewhere?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him wonderingly. He was quietly but well dressed after the
  fashion of the class to whose ranks he was climbing. His dinner coat and
  black tie were irreproachable, his linen correct, his plain gold studs
  unobtrusive. His air of complete self-possession moved her to a
  half-unwilling admiration.</p>

  <p>"But, Matthew," she protested, "what would Philip say?"</p>

  <p>"Philip is an ass," was the somewhat impatient rejoinder. "He proved it,
  the night we all parted."</p>

  <p>"You didn't mean&mdash;what he thought you meant?" she asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I meant nothing at all," he assured her, "just as, at the present moment,
  I mean nothing except that I want to take you out to dinner."</p>

  <p>"It would be rather nice," she confessed, "especially as I can't find
  Philip, and a solitary sixpence is all I possess until&mdash;listen well,
  Matthew&mdash;until treasury day to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Treasury day?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you all about it as we go along," she promised. "Can we go
  somewhere where they wear old clothes and I sha'n't disgrace you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course we can; clothes aren't anything," he answered
  sententiously.</p>

  <p>"They're going to form a good part of my life for the next few days," she
  declared. "I've paid all my debts, Matthew, I draw five pounds to-morrow, and
  I'm going to spend the greater part of it in clothes. Come along, then, if
  you're really going to take me to dine. I am so nearly starving that I was
  going to ask them if they would trust me for the house dinner here."</p>

  <p>Matthew called a taxi, notwithstanding his companion's protests, and they
  drove to a small but intimate restaurant in Soho, a restaurant where the
  tables were a long way apart and the sole illumination was provided by
  rose-shaded lamps. Matthew, who had only heard of the place, entered with the
  air of an habitu&eacute;, handed his coat and hat to a bowing
  <i>vestiaire</i>, and at once commandeered the best table. Rosina leaned back
  in her corner and looked around her with delight.</p>

  <p>"I don't care a bit about my clothes here, Matthew," she declared. "It
  looks delightfully romantic but horribly expensive."</p>

  <p>"The time will soon arrive, Rosina, where expense will be of no
  consequence in the world to me," was the confident reply.</p>

  <p>"How ever do you manage to make such rapid progress?" she asked
  wonderingly.</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"Some people find it just as easy to travel the other way," he said. "Do
  you know whom I had to see me in the city this morning, Rosina?"</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine," she acknowledged.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Benjamin Stone."</p>

  <p>"Uncle Benjamin? Do you mean that he really has taken the trouble to see
  what has become of us?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that I can't do him that credit," Matthew answered. "Even our
  meeting was entirely accidental. He came to see the firm with whom I am in
  business."</p>

  <p>"What a joke!" Rosina laughed. "Was he surprised to see you?"</p>

  <p>"He was surprised when he found that it was I with whom he had to deal,"
  Matthew replied, with a slightly self-conscious smile. "My firm have been his
  largest customers for years."</p>

  <p>"Did he help you to get your place with them?" Rosina asked.</p>

  <p>"Help me? Not he!" Matthew scoffed. "Can you see Uncle Benjamin helping
  one of us! Never mind, I turned the tables on him this morning. Do you know
  what I did, Rosina?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I don't. Tell me, please?" she begged.</p>

  <p>"I bought him out&mdash;bought his factory at Norchester, bought his
  plant, stock, good will, name, and all the lot of it."</p>

  <p>"Goodness gracious!" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"Can you guess why he had to sell?" Matthew went on.</p>

  <p>"How could I?"</p>

  <p>"To pay his creditors," he declared triumphantly.</p>

  <p>Rosina was bewildered.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand that at all," she confessed. "Uncle Benjamin is a very
  rich man, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>"I very much doubt whether he's worth a shilling," Matthew announced, with
  zest. "I have suspected it for a long while. All the time I was in the
  factory, I kept on pointing out to him how behindhand the firm was, how money
  could be made instead of lost, how, by a little enterprise and by spending a
  little, we could have saved thousands. Not a bit of use. He preferred praying
  for prosperity to working for it. He wouldn't listen to me, and this is the
  end of it."</p>

  <p>"Poor Uncle Benjamin!" Rosina murmured.</p>

  <p>"We shall remodel the factory and make a lot of money out of it," Matthew
  proceeded. "Rosina, taste your champagne. It is one of the best brands. We
  will drink to my partnership with the firm of Faringdon, Nettleby, Ford and
  Company. It will come very soon, Rosina. I am going to be a very rich
  man."</p>

  <p>She tasted the wine and laughed across at him as she drank his toast. In
  her cheap clothes, underneath the hat which her own fingers had fashioned and
  trimmed, she was still radiantly beautiful. She brought with her into the
  restaurant, redolent of a thousand sordid flirtations, an atmosphere of
  delicate freshness, of virginal passion for life and its joys, which gave her
  an unanalysable and indefinable charm. Even Matthew's turgid blood crept
  through his veins a little more warmly for the sight of her.</p>

  <p>"You really are very clever, Matthew," she declared.</p>

  <p>"I am clever in one way, just as Philip may be clever in another," he
  answered. "I wish I could make you realise, Rosina, that, so long as this is
  the world in which we have got to live, mine is the way that will count. The
  man with the type of brains that makes money and brings power is the man who
  climbs here. Philip likes to dream and moon about, and because he can put a
  few pleasant-sounding words together about things that never have and never
  could have happened, he thinks himself superior to every one else, and you
  humour him and pretend to believe the same thing. What's he going to get out
  of his story-writing, if he's successful? A ten-roomed house in the suburbs
  when he's middle-aged, and the joy of his work cramped every day by having to
  write things to pay the bills! I have thought this all out, Rosina. The poor
  man has got to live in a small world, and the smaller the world, the narrower
  he becomes, and the more completely any gifts he may possess shrink away and
  lessen. Mind you, this is if he is moderately successful. If he fails, it
  just means drink and shabbiness and misery."</p>

  <p>The light had passed for a time out of Rosina's face. She was conscious of
  a chill disquietude. All her first joy in the warmth and the pleasant food
  and the glow of the wine had momentarily passed. She felt the depressing
  influence of Matthew's words, the nearness of ugly and unfamiliar things.</p>

  <p>"When have you thought this all out so carefully, Matthew?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"We all have our own idea of recreation," he replied. "When I'm not at my
  work, and I've nothing particular to think about in connection with it, I
  just try to get the things of the world, with which I am not in actual touch,
  into their proper focus. If there is anything I want to bring into my life, I
  just plan how to get it there."</p>

  <p>"You talk like a spider sitting in the middle of his web," she protested,
  half mirthfully, half uneasily.</p>

  <p>He smiled complacently.</p>

  <p>"The simile is a bad one," he said. "I do not need to destroy. I am
  content to brush to one side anything that stands in my way. As an example of
  what I mean, I will take your own outlook. You saw life truthfully enough
  when we three came up to London. You knew what you wanted, just as I did.
  That was so much to the good. You wanted soft silks to wear next your body,
  you wanted gowns fashioned by an artist to float around you, hats fashioned
  by fingers that understood, the right sort of jewellery, flowers,
  music&mdash;in short, all the graces of life. On the whole, I approve. These
  are the things to which a beautiful woman has some claim. Unless she has a
  talent, and can use it, there is little more which she can ask of life."</p>

  <p>He paused and looked across at her earnestly.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Philip will never be able to give you those things; I shall."</p>

  <p>Rosina did not flinch. She studied her companion gravely, yet not without
  a certain almost childish curiosity, an ingenuous desire to obtain the truth,
  even at the risk of pain.</p>

  <p>"But you do not wish to marry me, as Philip does?"</p>

  <p>If Matthew had ever run any risk of departing from his established
  principles in life, that might have been the moment, for there was a thrill
  in the very na&iuml;vet&eacute; of the question. He hesitated, and the world
  seemed upside down, roaring strange music in his ears. Then he was himself
  again.</p>

  <p>"No," he admitted, "I do not wish to marry you."</p>

  <p>She faced the situation bravely, determined to make no back-door
  retreat.</p>

  <p>"Then why tantalise me?" she asked. "I quite agree with you, up to a
  certain point. Philip's talents may never bring material prosperity. I may
  have to do without the things which I should love to have. On the other hand,
  we may find a different sort of happiness."</p>

  <p>The tenseness of the moment had passed. Matthew, like many a greater
  general before him, had withdrawn his forces to avoid disaster. He called for
  coffee and liqueurs, lit a cigarette, and assumed the good-natured air of a
  man who yields a point out of courtesy.</p>

  <p>"I shall be ready to resume the conversation," he said, "whenever it
  pleases you&mdash;or rather, whenever a certain time arrives."</p>

  <p>"What time?"</p>

  <p>"When you are ready to speak of and for yourself; when you do not commence
  by saying 'Philip and I.'"</p>

  <p>"That will be never," she declared, a little defiantly.</p>

  <p>"I am inclined to doubt it," was the deliberate rejoinder.</p>

  <p>A sort of terror of life and all that it might mean seized her as she sat
  there. Matthew seemed so sure of himself and his outlook. What if he should
  be right, after all&mdash;if life should develop into a sort of Juggernaut of
  materialism, beneath the hideous weight of which, dreams and aspirations,
  everything that came from the soul, were crushed to death by the sheer brute
  force of necessity! She thought of Philip's struggle, a poor affair at
  present. She remembered herself, saved practically from starvation by a lucky
  chance. She remembered the sordid details of their poverty, and for a moment
  her faith flickered, the pain of it tore at her heartstrings.</p>

  <p>"I want to go," she said. "You're depressing me, Matthew."</p>

  <p>He laughed and looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"I haven't done with you yet," he told her, "Wouldn't you like to go to a
  music hall?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I should," she agreed. "What a dear you are to think of it!
  Let's go at once&mdash;this very moment. This place seems filled with
  grinning fancies. I've enjoyed my dinner so much, Matthew, but I'm dying to
  get away."</p>

  <p>He paid the bill, and they found two vacant stalls at one of the big
  Variety houses. The show was ordinary enough, but Rosina passed back at once
  into her normal self. With hundreds of cheerful people around her, life
  itself seemed to beat to a different tune, even though the people were
  strangers, and the pianist who was occupying the stage was evidently
  suffering from the desire to render popular music. She suffered no relapse in
  spirits for the rest of the evening. When the performance was over, she
  firmly resisted Matthew's desire to take a taxi and made him walk home with
  her. She even took his arm in the old, friendly fashion.</p>

  <p>"You haven't told me about this last venture of yours, Rosina," he
  reminded her. "I think I have some idea as to what it is. I saw you coming
  out of the stage door of the Garrick, the other evening."</p>

  <p>She told him about her adventure, and he expressed his approval.</p>

  <p>"I think that you are very lucky," he declared. "Any play by Douglas Erwen
  is certain to run for some time. When is the first night?"</p>

  <p>"On Monday," she replied, with a little grimace. "I am shivering
  already."</p>

  <p>"Anyhow," he observed, "whether the show is a success or not, the
  experience will be good for you."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I mean that a little more insight into real life won't do you any
  harm."</p>

  <p>"I sha'n't find out anything about real life in the chorus at the
  Garrick," she objected.</p>

  <p>"You are a little young yet," he said indulgently, "to know what real life
  consists of. Your brain is still filled with fancies. There was just one
  chapter of the Bible which Uncle Benjamin used to shove down our throats,
  which seemed to me to have some common sense in it. 'Render unto C&aelig;sar
  the things which are C&aelig;sar's,' came in it. I call that sound
  philosophy. Sooner or later you'll find out that, so long as you are of this
  world, you must live as though you are&mdash;until you get to the next. Will
  you come and dine with me again soon, Rosina?"</p>

  <p>She answered him quite frankly.</p>

  <p>"Matthew, I really don't know."</p>

  <p>"Why not? I've tried to give you a pleasant evening."</p>

  <p>"And, believe me, I'm very grateful," she assured him. "But as to coming
  again&mdash;well, for one thing I don't think Philip would like it, and for
  another&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, for another?" he insisted, after a somewhat prolonged pause.</p>

  <p>They were standing on the pavement outside the door of her hostel.
  Suddenly she leaned over and gave him the little kiss on the cheek which had
  been their nightly salute at Norchester.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," she laughed. "I expect I'm a most tremendous idiot,
  and fancy some things and don't understand others. We'll see. Good night,
  Matthew!"</p>

  <p>Matthew, on his homeward walk, amused himself by taking stock of his
  progress with Rosina. There was a debit and a credit side to this, as there
  was to all his few pleasures. Apart from the financial side of the
  question&mdash;with all his seeming carelessness, he knew to a penny what his
  evening's entertainment had cost him&mdash;there was the fact that he might
  have attended an evening party at the house of a lady in whom he was far more
  seriously interested than in Rosina. Yet there remained always to confuse him
  that unanalysable factor&mdash;human preference&mdash;a factor which he
  found, to his dismay, was stealthily assuming unjustifiable proportions. When
  he had reached his rooms, he had almost arrived at the same decision as
  Rosina, who was just then creeping stealthily into her cubicle.</p>

  <p>"I do not think," she sighed, as she turned out her light, "that I must go
  out again with Matthew."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="a-11"
     name="a-11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Rosina came down the paved way which led from the stage door
  of the Garrick Theatre into Charing Cross Road, with flying footsteps.
  Philip, a little weary with his half-hour's wait in the windy street,
  welcomed her with joy.</p>

  <p>"At last, dear!" she exclaimed. "I've been trying so hard to get away, but
  the dressing rooms were all crowded and it seemed impossible to move. Mr.
  Erwen has gone on to the Savoy, and he left a special message to say how glad
  he should be to see you. I'm afraid we'll have to have a cab. I've spent all
  my money on this frock, and couldn't afford anything that even looked like a
  cloak."</p>

  <p>"We'll have a cab, of course," Philip replied, hailing one from the other
  side of the street. "I should have had one waiting, but I couldn't tell
  exactly what time you'd be out."</p>

  <p>They took their places inside and directed the man to drive to the
  Savoy.</p>

  <p>"Kiss me at once, please, Philip," Rosina begged, "but don't disarrange my
  hair. I am really too excited to breathe. Tell me what you thought of it
  all?"</p>

  <p>Philip held her for a moment in his arms. She closed her eyes with the
  delight of his embrace.</p>

  <p>"I saw you, dear, quite well," he said, as they settled down. "I was in
  the third row of the pit, and you looked sweet."</p>

  <p>Rosina smiled contentedly.</p>

  <p>"I felt so stiff and awkward," she confided, "and I'm terrified for my
  five pounds a week. I heard some one tell Mr. Erwen that we were really only
  in the way&mdash;didn't help the play at all&mdash;and I'm afraid that he was
  right. One of the other girls told me that, if Mr. Erwen hadn't insisted, we
  should all of us have been sent away at the last rehearsal."</p>

  <p>Philip frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>"Have you been seeing much of this fellow Erwen lately?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Rosina looked straight ahead of her.</p>

  <p>"Very little," she replied. "He asked me to go out to lunch with him the
  other day, but I got him to take some of the other girls, too. Last night he
  invited me to dine, but I remembered what you asked me, Philip&mdash;I didn't
  go."</p>

  <p>"Did you mind not going?" he demanded jealously.</p>

  <p>"Just a little, I did," Rosina admitted. "You see, he is really very nice,
  Philip, and you were engaged with Mr. Homan, and dinner at the hostel is
  simply awful."</p>

  <p>Philip was momentarily gloomy.</p>

  <p>"I had to go with Homan," he said. "He wanted to introduce me to the man
  who has been illustrating my stories."</p>

  <p>"Of course! I understood that, dear," Rosina replied. "I didn't really
  mind a bit. Tell me what you thought about the illustrator, and how is Mr.
  Homan?"</p>

  <p>"Homan's all right," Philip answered, "but I didn't think much of the
  illustrator. The fact of it is, Rosina, I'm afraid that the magazine is going
  to be a pretty cheap sort of affair."</p>

  <p>Rosina nodded sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"Of course it will be, dear," she agreed, "but then, after all, you must
  make a start. I don't fancy myself grinning for five pounds a week from the
  back of the stage at the Garrick, but we've got to live, haven't we, until
  our time comes? Meanwhile, let's make up our minds to thoroughly enjoy
  ourselves. We're going to a real first-night supper party at the Savoy,
  you're wearing your first dress suit and I have a new frock."</p>

  <p>"Dress suit from a second-hand place, price two pounds ten," Philip
  observed, looking down. "I kept my overcoat on in the pit, so that it
  shouldn't get dusty. The trousers are a little short, but the coat isn't
  bad."</p>

  <p>"It's a beautiful fit," Rosina insisted, "and as for the price, my gown
  only cost three pounds."</p>

  <p>"You made most of it yourself," Philip reminded her, "and you couldn't
  have looked nicer if it had cost thirty."</p>

  <p>"So long as we are satisfied with one another, nothing matters, does it?"
  Rosina declared, holding his arm a little more tightly. "Do you see where we
  are? Do you realise, Philip, that we are actually in the courtyard of the
  Savoy? There's where we stood with our backs to the wall and looked in
  through the great windows, that first night in London. We didn't think we
  should be here together so soon, did we?"</p>

  <p>Philip made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"It isn't quite the same thing, coming like this," he reminded her. "I'd
  rather we were having supper alone together out of my first publisher's
  cheque, than that I was coming here as the guest of your friend."</p>

  <p>"We can't have everything," Rosina observed cheerfully. "It's quite
  wonderful enough, as it is. There's Mr. Erwen standing just inside, by the
  door. Pay the man quickly and come along, Philip."</p>

  <p>Erwen welcomed Philip with some curiosity, introduced the two to some
  other guests, and led them all presently to the great table in the middle of
  the restaurant, where supper had been prepared. With the exception of Rosina,
  only the principals in the play were present, but there was at least a score
  of other guests, most of them people who were interested in the theatre, and
  a few already known to Rosina. Reggie Towers greeted her across the table,
  and seemed a little surprised at the presence of her companion.</p>

  <p>"You seem to know quite a great many people," Philip remarked.</p>

  <p>"They drop into the theatre at rehearsal time," she explained, "and Mr.
  Erwen is like all Americans&mdash;he introduces everybody to every one. It's
  a friendly sort of place, Philip, as you'll find out when your play is
  produced," she added softly.</p>

  <p>She suddenly discovered that she knew the girl next to her companion, and
  introduced him. Philip, however, was not inclined to be sociable. He was
  watching his host, who leaned across continually to talk to Rosina. Erwen
  appeared to find the latter's conversation so engrossing, in fact, that
  Elinor Hardman, the leading lady, who was seated on his right, began to fancy
  herself neglected.</p>

  <p>"Who is the ing&eacute;nue, Douglas?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Well, you ought to recognise her," he answered. "She's in the show."</p>

  <p>"Really?" was the somewhat languid reply. "I hadn't noticed her. And the
  truculent-looking person by her side?"</p>

  <p>"A young man from her part of the country," Erwen explained. "They're
  rather by way of being a couple of babes in the wood, come from the back of
  nowhere to make their fortunes in the city."</p>

  <p>"The young man will be very good-looking some day," Miss Hardman declared,
  "if he gets over his sulkiness and doesn't drink too much champagne. Shall I
  take him in hand?"</p>

  <p>"I wish you would," was the tactless reply.</p>

  <p>"So that you could flirt with his companion," Miss Hardman observed
  coldly.</p>

  <p>Erwen frowned.</p>

  <p>"One doesn't flirt with a child like that," he said under his breath. "To
  tell you the truth, Elinor, I'm rather sorry I ever gave her a job at the
  theatre."</p>

  <p>The young lady smiled, not altogether pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Why did you do it, then?"</p>

  <p>"There you get me," he admitted. "Kind of fancy, I suppose. She wandered
  into the place quite by accident, in the most ingenuous sort of way, and,
  before I realised what I was doing, I made Sam take her on. She's so
  wonderfully young, so keen to enjoy and so ridiculously ignorant. The stage
  is the wrong sort of forcing house for her, and she is there before her time.
  If she is really fond of the boy, that may help her."</p>

  <p>Miss Elinor Hardman was frankly bored. She turned a very bare and very
  white shoulder upon her host and proceeded to talk with animation to Reggie
  Towers. Presently, the little company moved downstairs, in twos and threes,
  to dance. Erwen himself showed Rosina and Philip the way to the ballroom.</p>

  <p>"Miss Vonet tells me that you are a writer," he remarked pleasantly to the
  latter.</p>

  <p>"I hope to be some day," Philip replied. "I haven't had much luck
  yet."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Garth has two stories coming out in a new magazine almost at once,"
  Rosina announced.</p>

  <p>"Capital! I suppose you'll try your hand at a play, some day or other?"
  his host went on.</p>

  <p>"I have one under way," Philip admitted.</p>

  <p>Erwen laughed good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>"Why, you're beginning even earlier than I did!" he exclaimed. "If you
  want any hints at any time, come and look me up. I live in the hotel here
  when I'm over on this side. Here we are," he added, as they entered the
  ballroom. "Do you mind if I dance with Miss Vonet? That's our table over
  there. You'll find some champagne going, and these girls are all crazy on
  dancing, if you care about it."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I'm terribly stupid," Rosina confessed, smiling up at her
  host.</p>

  <p>"I guess I sha'n't discover that," he answered. "Any way, we'll try."</p>

  <p>Philip went over to the table and at first made some efforts to be
  agreeable. The young women of the party, however, were speedily claimed by
  older friends, and there was nothing for him to do but to sit down and watch.
  Rosina, to whom dancing was a new joy, was perhaps a little led away by the
  intense pleasure of it all, the subtle flattery of her host's point-blank
  refusal to let her go. Philip sat and drank champagne, and the more he drank,
  the grimmer his face became, the whiter his cheeks, the more brilliant the
  one little spot of colour. Rosina, floating by in a dream of delight, a dream
  in which her partner played a very inconsiderable share, was suddenly
  reminded of him. She stopped short.</p>

  <p>"Do forgive me, Mr. Erwen," she begged. "I forgot all about Philip. I must
  not leave him alone any longer."</p>

  <p>"He can find some one to talk to, if he wants to," her partner objected.
  "Let's finish this dance, anyway."</p>

  <p>But Rosina had already left him. She crossed the floor to where Philip was
  seated. He made no effort to rise&mdash;he did not even smile. He had the
  appearance of a sulky boy.</p>

  <p>"Philip, dear, I'm so sorry I've left you alone all this time!" she
  exclaimed, a little frightened. "The dancing has been so wonderful. Do come
  and try. I'm perfectly certain you can manage all right, if you just listen
  to the music."</p>

  <p>Philip rose a little unsteadily to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I'm going home," he announced.</p>

  <p>Rosina turned and held out her hand to her host, who was hovering in the
  background.</p>

  <p>"It has been a wonderful party, Mr. Erwen," she declared. "Thank you so
  much for asking us."</p>

  <p>"But you mustn't go yet," he protested. "There are half a dozen men here,
  besides myself, who want to dance with you."</p>

  <p>"You promised me, Miss Vonet," Reggie Towers, who had just hurried up,
  declared.</p>

  <p>There were other protests. Rosina shook her head to them all.</p>

  <p>"Don't hurry Miss Vonet off," Erwen begged, turning to Philip. "The
  night's young yet."</p>

  <p>"Miss Vonet can do as she likes," Philip rejoined, gripping the back of a
  chair. "I have some work to do&mdash;some proofs."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, under those circumstances, you will accept my escort home, Miss
  Vonet?" Erwen begged, turning to Rosina.</p>

  <p>She shook her head, laughing, and passed her arm firmly through
  Philip's.</p>

  <p>"I am tired, too," she said. "Come along, Philip."</p>

  <p>They made their adieux and departed. In the lounge, whilst Rosina waited
  for Philip to fetch his coat and hat, a breathless page boy slipped a card
  into her hand. She glanced at the few pencilled words quickly:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Please come back when you have taken him home. I must have
  one more dance.<br>
  D. E.</p><br>

  <p>She tore the card quickly across.</p>

  <p>"There is no answer," she told the boy, turning away.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Rosina that the whole glamour of the evening faded as soon as
  she was alone with Philip in the taxi. He sat stretched out in an ungraceful
  attitude, with his hands in his coat pockets, his face still set and grim.
  There was no consciousness of her near presence, beautiful and pulsating with
  life though she was. He seemed to be nursing some sombre grievance.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "I hope you've enjoyed yourself."</p>

  <p>The sweetness of her began to shrivel up at the first sound of his voice.
  She was suddenly conscious that he had had a great deal too much to drink,
  that his hair was ruffled, his tie ill-arranged, his shirt front creased, his
  voice thick.</p>

  <p>"I have enjoyed myself very much indeed, up to now," she rejoined.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what I came to the d&mdash;d party for," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Neither do I," she remarked amiably.</p>

  <p>"If those are your friends," he went on, "if those are the people you are
  going to spend all your time with, why bother about me? I don't know any of
  them, and I don't want to. I don't dance, I don't want to drink their wine or
  eat their suppers. And as for your show, I hate it."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you a little difficult to-night, or is it my fancy?" she asked,
  with fine satire.</p>

  <p>"Your fancy entirely," he assured her. "I've been having a delightful
  evening and I'm in the wildest possible spirits."</p>

  <p>The taxicab came to an unexpected standstill. She looked out of the window
  in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Why, Philip, this is Adam Street!" she exclaimed. "Aren't you going to
  see me home?"</p>

  <p>"No!" he answered. "You'd better go back and dance for another hour or so
  with Mr. Douglas Erwen. Here's the money for the cab."</p>

  <p>She pushed it away and drew a sharp little breath which sounded almost
  like a sob. His hand was already upon the door.</p>

  <p>"Philip," she protested, "you're not in earnest. You won't leave me like
  this?"</p>

  <p>"I think you'll find that I shall," he answered, stepping out of the cab
  without even touching her fingers.</p>

  <p>She leaned out of the window.</p>

  <p>"Philip," she pleaded, "don't be so brutal. If you haven't had a pleasant
  evening, it isn't my fault. I did all that I could, but you have been a
  little difficult, haven't you? Come and drive me home, dear. You haven't
  kissed me once. You haven't even said good night."</p>

  <p>He turned for a moment and faced her, holding on to his latchkey with his
  right hand. There was nothing to tell her that, in his way, he was decidedly
  and distinctly drunk.</p>

  <p>"Good night!" he said, and passed inside the building, slamming the door
  behind him.</p>

  <p>"Where to, miss?" the taxicab driver enquired.</p>

  <p>Rosina sat with her hands clasped tightly in each other. All the joy of
  the evening seemed spent. There remained only an aftermath of utter and
  complete misery. Then a sudden anger blazed up in her. It was his own
  suggestion, his own fault.</p>

  <p>"Back to the Savoy," she told the man.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="a-12"
     name="a-12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Douglas Erwen's party showed no signs of flagging. Only the
  host himself seemed unaccountably to have lost his interest in the
  proceedings. Elinor Hardman frankly challenged him with his lack of spirits,
  and, receiving no satisfactory reply, deserted him for more appreciative
  partners. Erwen sought out his friend, Reggie Towers, and sat down with him
  to watch the dancing. The latter, though not a person of remarkable
  discrimination, echoed Miss Hardman's observation.</p>

  <p>"Seem a bit hipped to-night, Duggie, what?" he ventured. "The show went
  all right, didn't it? I'm not afraid for my money. Good for five hundred
  nights, I should think."</p>

  <p>"Oh, curse the show!" Erwen answered irritably. "It isn't that at all.
  It's just the little things that seem to have got me on the raw."</p>

  <p>Lord Reginald nodded in sympathetic silence, and made mystic signs to one
  of the waiters relative to the opening of a gold-foiled bottle.</p>

  <p>"First of all," Erwen enlarged, dropping his voice a little, "these girls
  get on my nerves. Elinor's a good sort in her way, but she's trying&mdash;she
  harps on the same thing too long. Then I ought to go back to New York, but I
  don't like leaving the show just yet. And finally, everybody&mdash;Elinor,
  Sam, the producer, and every member of the company&mdash;insists upon having
  the chorus cleared out. I suppose they ought to go, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But you hate sending your little ingenu&eacute; away?" Reggie Towers
  ventured. "Can't you put a line or two in for her somewhere? She's pretty
  enough to be worth keeping in the show."</p>

  <p>"Say, don't you think I'd just love to!" Erwen replied forcibly. "But how
  can I? She's no more idea of acting than the biggest gawk who was ever booed
  off the stage. She's just as sweet and self-conscious as she can be, from the
  moment when she makes her most unstage-like entrance, to the moment she gets
  off&mdash;heaven knows how! And she's never earned five pounds a week before,
  and she thinks it's going on for ever."</p>

  <p>"No way you can make it up to her, I suppose?" Lord Reginald remarked
  guardedly.</p>

  <p>"What the devil way is there?" Erwen rejoined, with some irritation. "I
  could no more offer her money than I could offer it to one of your
  princesses. She's over-sensitive now, and I had the hardest work to arrange
  that matter about payment for rehearsals. Some ass told her that it wasn't
  usual, and she came to me in a great state. She hasn't a dollar to her
  name&mdash;no more has that other country cousin she brought with her
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"Sulky, Byronic youth," Reggie Towers reflected. "I didn't like him."</p>

  <p>"Young cub," Erwen agreed warmly. "Sulked because I danced with the child
  a few times. Her first party, too! And then took her off home just as she was
  beginning to enjoy herself."</p>

  <p>"She may come back again," Reggie suggested hopefully. "Didn't you say
  that you had sent her a message?"</p>

  <p>"I sent her a message, all right," was the dejected reply, "but she won't
  come. As a matter of fact, I am afraid she was angry at my proposing it. The
  page boy says that she tore up the card."</p>

  <p>Lord Reginald sipped his wine thoughtfully, tapped a cigarette upon the
  table and leaned back in his chair.</p>

  <p>"That might have been so that the young cub with her shouldn't see it," he
  observed.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet you a fiver she doesn't come," Erwen offered gloomily.</p>

  <p>"It would be easy money," the other replied, "but unfair&mdash;for
  behold!"</p>

  <p>Erwen followed the direction of his friend's gesture and sprang to his
  feet with a little exclamation. Rosina was standing upon the threshold of the
  room, looking about her. She saw Erwen's wave of the hand and advanced to
  meet him at once. Glad though he was, the sight of her gave him almost a
  shock. It seemed as though she had grown from a child to a woman since they
  had parted, a quarter of an hour ago.</p>

  <p>"You see, I have done as you suggested," she said. "Philip is tired and I
  have taken him home. I have come back for some more dances."</p>

  <p>"I am a great deal more glad than I know how to tell you just at the
  moment," Erwen declared, as they moved off together. "Somehow, I haven't
  fancied dancing since you left," he added, under his breath. "There's no one
  else steps so lightly as you do."</p>

  <p>There was dancing and more dancing, supper and more champagne, of which
  Rosina partook, although sparingly enough. There were plenty of other men
  anxious to dance with her, and Rosina kept the promise she had made to
  herself when she had driven away from Philip's rooms. The little sob in her
  heart was forgotten. Every one&mdash;at least, so it seemed to her&mdash;was
  friendly and delightful. The music and dancing by themselves were a joy. She
  let herself go with all the pent-up longing of her heart. This was the sort
  of innocent pleasure and companionship for which she had longed. She had a
  smile for every one. Her eyes were aglow and her feet seemed to move upon the
  air. Several times, Erwen almost lost his head, but the faintly troubled look
  in her eyes when he showed signs of offending, seemed to check the simplest
  words of love-making upon his lips. Once, when Rosina was dancing with Reggie
  Towers, and Erwen, instead of doing his duty elsewhere, was impatiently
  awaiting her return, Elinor Hardman crossed the room and stood for a moment
  by his side.</p>

  <p>"Your little ing&eacute;nue is coming on, Douglas," she observed,
  directing his attention to the dancers.</p>

  <p>He affected not to notice the malice beneath her words.</p>

  <p>"It is her first party," he said. "I want her to enjoy it."</p>

  <p>"You seem to be succeeding," was the somewhat caustic reply,&mdash;"a
  little at the expense of some of your other guests, perhaps."</p>

  <p>She left him as Rosina returned, followed by her protesting partner. Erwen
  danced with her again and again. The night wore on. Rosina suddenly realised
  that the rooms were nearly empty. She gave a little start.</p>

  <p>"I am behaving shockingly," she declared. "Nearly every one has gone, and
  I ought to have been one of the first. Can you show me where to get a taxi,
  please?"</p>

  <p>Erwen laughed.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a silly child," he said. "I shall see you home, of course. They
  won't miss me for a few minutes. This way."</p>

  <p>He paused in the vestibule.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you going to fetch your cloak?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I haven't a cloak," she confided. "Fancy coming to one's first party
  without a cloak and without a chaperon! But I shall never forget it. Every
  one has been sweet&mdash;especially you, dear host."</p>

  <p>She gave his arm a little friendly squeeze as she spoke. He handed her
  into the taxicab. His voice, when he spoke, sounded a little unnatural.</p>

  <p>"This isn't the sort of life for you, anyway," he declared. "How did you
  stumble into it? Haven't you really a relative in the world to look after
  you?"</p>

  <p>She leaned back in the corner of the cab and closed her eyes. She was
  suddenly tired.</p>

  <p>"No one except Uncle Benjamin," she murmured, "and we all three ran away
  from him."</p>

  <p>"Haven't you an older woman friend in London&mdash;any one at all to take
  care of you?" he persisted, almost roughly.</p>

  <p>She opened her eyes and looked at him.</p>

  <p>"I don't need one," she assured him. "Of course, I should like a woman
  friend very much, and some day I dare say I shall have one. Meanwhile, I can
  take care of myself."</p>

  <p>"Take care of yourself! Poor child!" he groaned.</p>

  <p>She sat up in her place.</p>

  <p>"You seem very strange, all of a sudden," she complained. "Is anything the
  matter? I haven't displeased you, have I?"</p>

  <p>"Displeased me? You poor little baby, no!" he replied. "Only I wish you'd
  tell me the name of this uncle of yours from whom you ran away."</p>

  <p>"His name is Benjamin Stone and he lives at Norchester. Why do you want to
  know?"</p>

  <p>"Some day," Erwen muttered, "I may tell him just what I think of him.
  Meanwhile, this, I suppose, is your abode. Looks pretty gloomy, doesn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"They're all in bed, I expect," Rosina remarked. "Tell me, what time is
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Ten minutes past four."</p>

  <p>She was suddenly aghast.</p>

  <p>"And every one is supposed to be in by half-past eleven," she murmured. "I
  forgot even to let them know that I should be late."</p>

  <p>"You have a key?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, thank goodness! I shall crawl in. Good night, Mr. Erwen. I can't
  thank you enough for your party."</p>

  <p>"You don't need to thank me any," he assured her. "You've been the party.
  Hurry in now. I'll wait and see that you're all right."</p>

  <p>Rosina stepped lightly across the pavement, glittering from the effects of
  a recent shower, thrust the key into the lock and turned it. The lock yielded
  easily enough but the door remained immovable. Her heart sank as she realised
  that it was bolted inside. She rang the
  bell&mdash;once&mdash;twice&mdash;without result. Then a window on the first
  floor opened. Rosina looked up.</p>

  <p>"Please, Miss Dean, can you send some one to let me in?" she begged. "I've
  been to a party, and the door is bolted."</p>

  <p>The woman leaned a little farther out of the window. What she said was
  conveyed in one or two sentences which Erwen could not hear, and which Rosina
  never at any time repeated. Erwen, however, was just in time to catch the
  girl upon the pavement. Rosina, as pale as death, had very nearly collapsed.
  She clung to him for a moment hysterically. They heard the closing of the
  window above.</p>

  <p>"They won't let me in&mdash;she won't take me back," Rosina faltered.
  "Tell me that you didn't hear what she said?" she added, almost fiercely.</p>

  <p>"I didn't hear a word," he assured her. "Look here, you'd better let me go
  and see what I can do."</p>

  <p>"Don't go near her!" Rosina implored passionately. "Let me get away
  somewhere. I can go to Philip. He will help me find a room."</p>

  <p>"Tell me the address?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>She gave it to him, and they turned once more back on to the Embankment.
  Rosina was sitting up, very pale and still shaking a little. In her face was
  the dumb expression of a hurt animal.</p>

  <p>"I can't go to Philip," she said, speaking half to herself. "Will you stop
  the cab, please? I want to get out here."</p>

  <p>"Don't be so foolish," he answered gruffly. "You can't get out and wander
  about the streets without a hat or a cloak on. Now just pull yourself
  together and think. Surely you have some friend you can go to?"</p>

  <p>"There is absolutely no one," she replied. "I would go to Philip but we
  have quarrelled. He would never, never forgive me."</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, after a moment's pause, "how old are you?"</p>

  <p>"Nineteen," she told him. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm thirty-nine. Look at me. Can you trust me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" she answered, without hesitation.</p>

  <p>For a moment he smiled. There were a great many lines in his face, and
  many people in London and New York who had things to say about him. There
  were even some amongst his men friends who would have considered Rosina's
  reply an excellent joke.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said, "sit tight and I'll find you a place to sleep
  in."</p>

  <p>He redirected the cabman, and they turned presently into the courtyard of
  the Savoy. Rosina trembled for a moment, but she asked no questions and
  followed her companion out. He led the way to the lift, summoned a sleepy
  attendant, and got out at the fourth floor. Rosina followed him along the
  corridor with beating heart. Presently he turned the handle of a door and
  they stood in a tiny, square hall. He turned another handle and opened the
  door of a little sitting room.</p>

  <p>"You go in there whilst I tackle Jane," he directed. "Don't be frightened
  if she shouts at you. She's all right."</p>

  <p>Rosina obeyed, speechless now with mingled relief and apprehension. Erwen
  knocked at the other door leading out of the little hall. Presently there was
  the sound of voices, one of them at first sleepy, then angry, finally
  resigned. Then the inner door at the far end of the sitting room was suddenly
  opened, and a short, stout woman, with a cap bound around her cropped grey
  hair, thrust in her head for a moment. Her voice was gruff, and she spoke
  with an extraordinary American accent, but there was a certain kindliness in
  her tone which almost brought the tears to Rosina's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Here, my child, I don't know who you are, and I don't want to to-night.
  I'm so damned sleepy, I could have wrung Duggie's neck when he woke me.
  Here's a dressing gown and a nightdress, and the door opposite leads into the
  bathroom. Guess you'll have to curl up on the sofa. Best I can do for you,
  anyway. Don't make a noise and stay there quietly in the morning until I come
  in for breakfast."</p>

  <p>The door was closed before Rosina could utter a word of thanks. Erwen
  thrust in his head from the outer door.</p>

  <p>"You're all right now, little girl," he said consolingly. "That's Jane
  McAlister, my dramatic agent. She's a holy terror but she's a white woman,
  and she's as good-natured as they make 'em. Good night!"</p>

  <p>Rosina's eyes were suddenly filled with welcome tears.</p>

  <p>"I've been so foolish," she faltered, "and I've given every one so much
  trouble."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" he answered. "You're all right now, anyway. Be as quiet as you
  can. Jane loves her sleep."</p>

  <p>He closed the door softly, and she heard the rattle of the lift in the
  distance, as he descended. In the inner room, Jane McAlister had recommenced
  to snore.</p>

  <h2><a id="a-13"
     name="a-13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It seemed to Philip, in the first moments of his awakening
  on the following morning, that every bitterness and humiliation which the
  world could hold had already found its way into his life. The very sight of
  his room, mercilessly revealed by the sunlight which flooded its way in
  through the uncurtained window, brought a groan to his lips. The apartment
  reeked with the smell of whisky and stale tobacco. An empty bottle stood upon
  the table. Some of his clothes lay in a heap upon the floor, others were
  flung across the bed. The bare deal furniture looked more squalid than ever.
  The few little evidences of Rosina's anxious care were swept out of
  existence. The handful of cheap flowers had perished from want of water. The
  clean cloth upon which his toilet things had been set out lay in the corner
  of the room where he had thrown it, already grimy with the accumulated dust
  which no fingers, however persevering, seemed able to collect. And, grimmest
  tragedy of all, there, where his heel had striven to grind it into the floor,
  lay the first copy of the magazine which was to have heralded his appearance
  into a new life, the magazine which was to have given to the world the first
  fruits of his brain, the miserable little packet which he had found awaiting
  him when he had come home to prepare for the long-looked-for evening with
  Rosina.</p>

  <p>He staggered out of bed, oppressed with a cloud of distasteful memories,
  threw open wide the window, stripped and washed as well as he could, and
  commenced to make a partial toilet. When he was sufficiently dressed, he
  turned his back upon the ugliness and disorder behind, and, with the despised
  magazine in his hand, he stood before the window, from which, over a
  wilderness of slate roofs and a few interposing chimneys, he could catch a
  fitful view of the river. He studied the magazine and its contents carefully,
  striving to free himself from the first agony of disappointment, to bring a
  judicious toleration to bear upon the wretched paper, the cheap
  illustrations, the poor type and frequent errors, which betokened slovenly
  production. He gazed at his own name, studied the distorted illustrations of
  these first creatures of his fancy, until finally the paper-covered volume
  slipped from his fingers, discarded without passion this time, but perhaps
  with even more of real and bitter despair. This defilement of his work, this
  hideous drop from all his buoyant imaginings, seemed somehow to lie in some
  sordid and melancholy apposition to the material squalor of his surroundings,
  his own tangled feelings, the depressing misery of the day-by-day life into
  which he had drifted.</p>

  <p>He was very young and he was extraordinarily foolish, but he had the
  saving grace of being able to look the truth in the face. He knew quite well
  where he stood. He traced his descent from the high places, a gradual but
  none the less assured descent, from the day of his first meeting with Homan.
  He remembered the older man's derision of his perhaps too fanciful and
  illusionary outlook upon life, and the romantic work which had been the
  outcome of his mental attitude; called to mind his continued demands for the
  stuff that would sell, his gibes at the beginner's loftier aspirations,
  unfolded, perhaps, under an unworthy stimulus, and losing, on every occasion,
  much of their vitality and freshness from the continual lava of Homan's
  cynicism. He thought of the poems which he had not even dared to offer; of
  the play, scarcely begun; of the novel which he had not touched for
  months&mdash;work which surely belonged to some other person, who had written
  with clean hands and upturned face. He thought with horror of the habit which
  had grown upon him under Homan's tuition, the false glow of content which it
  had produced, the specious optimism begotten of vulgar carouses amongst the
  flotsam and jetsam of the world of ready-made letters, the weaklings cast up
  by the great tide. Strength had been given him to climb, and he had taken his
  first step with cynical deliberation down the ladder of failure.</p>

  <p>It was across the paraphernalia of his disgraceful room that he turned at
  last to face the intruder, whose knockings he had heard for some time with
  purely mechanical inattention. Sombre as ever, dressed in the darkest grey,
  with his inevitable black bow tie, an ash stick in his ungloved hand, his
  wide-brimmed felt hat still upon his head, Benjamin Stone stood upon the
  threshold. He looked steadily across at his ward. Neither of the two embarked
  upon any form of greeting. After a brief pause, he closed the door behind him
  and came slowly forward.</p>

  <p>"You are ill-housed, Philip," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I do not expect visitors here, or receive them if I can help it," Philip
  answered churlishly. "How did you find me out?"</p>

  <p>"From Matthew," was the curt reply. "I hear that you three have parted
  company."</p>

  <p>"Matthew has grown too prosperous for us," Philip observed. "He has rooms
  somewhere in the West End. I&mdash;well, you see how and where I live. Rosina
  is at a girls' hostel in Westminster."</p>

  <p>"It is because of Rosina that I am here," Benjamin Stone said slowly. "I
  have heard a terrible thing about her. Will you tell me where she is to be
  found?"</p>

  <p>Anything to escape from where he was! It seemed, indeed, the last drop in
  the cup of his humiliation that Benjamin Stone should see this room, with its
  shameful evidences of debauchery. Philip caught up his hat.</p>

  <p>"I was going to see her this morning myself," he announced. "You can come
  with me, if you wish."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone pointed with the gnarled end of his stick towards the empty
  bottle which lay upon its side.</p>

  <p>"You have not been long in finding out one of God's greatest curses," he
  said. "Are you a drunkard as well as a sloven?"</p>

  <p>Philip showed no signs of offence. He flinched a little, and closed the
  door of the room behind him, as they stepped out on to the landing, with an
  air of relief.</p>

  <p>"It's a filthy room," he admitted, "and I made rather an ass of myself
  last night. I took Rosina to a party and I behaved badly. That's why I'm glad
  to be going to see her this morning."</p>

  <p>They descended to the street and turned towards the Embankment.</p>

  <p>"It's Rosina I'm somewhat anxious about," Benjamin Stone declared, as they
  walked along. "You two lads are no load upon my conscience. You chose your
  ways and you must abide by them. Matthew, to all appearance, has done well,
  and you're likely to do as ill, but that's just the way of things. Matthew's
  got the taste for steady living and steady working. You've got the wild
  spirit of your mother in your blood, and I doubt you'll end as badly as she
  did. You had the shelter of my roof as long as you wanted it, and the truth
  from me when you left it. Have you anything on your conscience, Philip
  Garth?"</p>

  <p>"Not with regard to you," was the unhesitating reply.</p>

  <p>His companion looked at him sternly.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing that you'd sleep better at nights for telling me," he
  went on, "here, where there's no one but the gulls to hear&mdash;a secret
  between you and me?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever! What should there be?"</p>

  <p>The frown on Benjamin Stone's face deepened. Tall though Philip was, his
  companion seemed to be looking down into the depths of his eyes.</p>

  <p>"You've no sin upon your conscience? Nothing you'd like to speak of with
  reference to your last few hours in Norchester? God forbid that I should
  bribe a sinner to confess, but it may be for your good to speak the
  truth."</p>

  <p>Philip laughed hardly.</p>

  <p>"Lying isn't amongst my many faults, that I know of," he said. "I haven't
  the faintest idea what you're talking about."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone looked away. They walked at least a hundred yards in
  silence. For a single moment, a speculative look crept into his still, grey
  eyes. The doubt from which it came, however, passed. When he spoke again, his
  tone was cold and expressionless.</p>

  <p>"I was about to speak of Rosina," he said. "The thought of her sometimes
  has been a trouble to me. It was well enough for you lads to work out your
  destinies up here, but Rosina was my sister's child. I should have kept a
  firmer hand upon her."</p>

  <p>"What have you heard that disturbs you about her?" Philip asked.</p>

  <p>"I hear that she has gone theatre acting," was the gloomy reply. "Matthew
  spoke of it when I called to see him in the city."</p>

  <p>"She had to earn money somehow, you see," Philip observed, a little
  bitterly. "They are giving her five pounds a week at the Garrick
  Theatre."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone gripped his stick more tightly and groaned.</p>

  <p>"Five pounds a week!" he repeated. "There's nothing but harm can come of
  money earned in such a fashion."</p>

  <p>"Beggars can't always be choosers," Philip reminded him. "Rosina and I
  have both spent our savings, and I have only just begun to earn a little by
  my writing. When it's food you need to keep you alive, and shelter to keep
  you from the streets, one can't afford to be too particular. I'd have worked
  till I dropped, to have kept Rosina from the stage. She's too beautiful, too
  wonderful, to come into touch with that sort of life at all. But I couldn't
  do it. I tried and I failed."</p>

  <p>They reached the hostel. In reply to their enquiry for Rosina, Miss Dean
  herself came into the shabby little reception room. She entered with the air
  of one about to perform a joyful task.</p>

  <p>"I understand," she said, addressing Benjamin Stone, "that you have come
  here to see Miss Vonet?"</p>

  <p>"If it is no inconvenience, madam. The young lady is my niece."</p>

  <p>"Miss Vonet is not here any longer," the head of the establishment
  announced.</p>

  <p>"Not here?" Philip intervened, with a sudden sinking of the heart. "Why,
  she was here yesterday."</p>

  <p>Miss Dean smoothed the front of her dress. She ignored Philip
  altogether.</p>

  <p>"This hostel," she explained, addressing Benjamin Stone, "is maintained
  for the purpose of affording a safe home for young women resident in London.
  Our rules are not unduly strict, but they are rules which must be complied
  with. Directly I heard that Miss Vonet had become a chorus girl, I decided
  that she must leave. Miss Vonet's behaviour, however, has been such that her
  leaving is no longer a matter of arrangement. I was under the painful
  necessity of turning her away myself at half-past four this morning."</p>

  <p>Philip gave a little cry of horror. For a moment the room swam around him.
  Benjamin Stone remained rigid and unmoving.</p>

  <p>"Miss Vonet knows the rules of this establishment," the woman continued.
  "She had the effrontery to remain out all night, and to return here at
  half-past four this morning with a man in a taxicab. I refused to admit
  her."</p>

  <p>"Was that your duty, madam?" Benjamin Stone asked.</p>

  <p>"It was a duty which I owed to the other young ladies of this
  establishment," was the cold reply.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea where she is&mdash;where she went to?" Philip demanded
  breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"I can only surmise," the woman answered, with a thin smile. "A messenger
  arrived this morning for her clothes, from the Savoy Hotel."</p>

  <p>They found their way out into the street. Philip, conscious of the fact
  that, although it was past midday, he had eaten and drunk nothing, felt
  suddenly faint and giddy. The horrible thought which was burning in his
  brain, however, drove away his weakness.</p>

  <p>"You have money in your pocket?" he asked his companion quickly.</p>

  <p>"Money? Of what use is money?" was the bitter reply.</p>

  <p>"You have enough for a cab, anyhow? You must have. Come!"</p>

  <p>Philip hailed a taxi and they drove in silence to the Savoy. Benjamin
  Stone sat with his hands clasped upon the top of his stick, his eyes fixed
  upon the stream of passing people. Once or twice his lips moved, yet he had
  the air of seeing nothing. Philip talked incoherently all the time. He blamed
  himself for his temper, for not having told Rosina of his disappointment.
  Under his breath, he cursed Erwen. When they had reached the hotel, he pushed
  past the porter and made his way to the desk.</p>

  <p>"I want to see Mr. Douglas Erwen," he announced.</p>

  <p>The reception clerk looked at him indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Have you an appointment?" he enquired. "Mr. Erwen is usually very busy at
  this hour of the morning."</p>

  <p>"I must see him at once," Philip insisted. "Will you send up word that
  Miss Vonet's uncle is here."</p>

  <p>The young man dispatched a page. Benjamin Stone and Philip stood together
  in the centre of the hall, somewhat incongruous figures, for Philip's toilet
  had received scanty attention, and Benjamin Stone had the air of a north
  country divine. He was gripping his gnarled stick with fingers of iron. There
  was a look in his face which reminded one of the Old Testament. The people
  who passed back and forth looked at them with languid curiosity. Down the
  stairs was a vista of the restaurant, towards which straggling groups of
  early lunchers were already making their way. Everywhere was an air of warmth
  and luxury. A woman who passed, over-rouged and with bold eyes, out of which
  she looked at the two with an air of insolent amusement, left a trail of
  perfume behind her. Benjamin Stone's knuckles were white where he gripped his
  stick.</p>

  <p>"He's long coming, this man, Philip," he said dourly.</p>

  <p>Then the last thing which they had expected happened. Across the lounge,
  in her simple, everyday frock, Rosina came towards them. She was perfectly
  self-possessed, perfectly at her ease amongst these unaccustomed
  surroundings. Her closely bound hair shone like burnished gold as she crossed
  the track of a ray of sunlight. Her cheeks, however, were pale, and there was
  a quality about her smile which neither of them had ever seen before.</p>

  <p>"I was in Mr. Erwen's room when your message came," she said, as she
  approached them. "I thought, perhaps, it was I whom you wanted to see."</p>

  <p>They were speechless. This girl was a stranger to them both.</p>

  <p>"Is this your first visit to London since we left Norchester?" she asked
  her uncle. "I am sorry you have had so much trouble to find me. You see, I
  stayed out late at a party last night, and the manageress of the hostel where
  I had a room refused to let me in. So Mr. Erwen brought me here."</p>

  <p>"I want a word with this man Erwen," Benjamin Stone said, slowly
  recovering himself.</p>

  <p>"My dear uncle, don't be absurd," Rosina replied. "Mr. Erwen is much too
  busy a man to see casual callers. Besides, what can you have to say to
  him?"</p>

  <p>She looked him full in the face, a touch of insolence in her cold stare.
  Benjamin Stone, however, remained unmoved.</p>

  <p>"You were in that man's charge last night," he declared stubbornly. "I
  will know how he acquitted himself of his trust."</p>

  <p>Rosina laughed, and Philip again fancied that this girl was a
  stranger.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't this sound a little like melodrama?" she asked easily. "If it
  didn't sound disrespectful, I might even enquire, uncle, what concern it is
  of yours?"</p>

  <p>"What concern it is of mine?" he repeated, momentarily at a
  disadvantage.</p>

  <p>"Yes! You wish me to explain? We are a little conspicuous here. Follow me,
  please, into this inner room."</p>

  <p>She led them into an apartment furnished as a reading room. Here they were
  almost alone. Arrived at its remote end, she turned and faced them once
  more.</p>

  <p>"Listen," she said, still ignoring Philip and addressing her uncle, "I
  have the misfortune, from your point of view and mine, to be your niece, and
  I have lived in your house since I was a child. You fed me and clothed me,
  both rather indifferently. My education amounted to nothing. You were reputed
  to be a wealthy man, and you sent me to the parish school. You refused to let
  me learn music, painting, dancing&mdash;any of the things I longed for. You
  brought me up in your own starved, grey fashion. If I ought to owe you
  gratitude for that, I don't. When the time came that I could stand it no
  longer, when I left you, you let me go without a word of kindness or of
  warning. From that day on until now, I have seen nothing of you. What did you
  care what became of me? What did you do to prevent any evil that might have
  come? Yet now, because I stayed out all night, and because a man found me
  shelter, you come here in the clothes of a preacher, with the hard, cruel
  Scripture in your face and a stick in your hand. It's rather poor melodrama,
  uncle. Somehow, I can't feel the right way about it."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone stood as though stricken dumb. He changed the stick from
  one hand to the other. There was a patch of wet on the handle, where he had
  been holding it. Then he opened his lips to speak, but Philip intervened.</p>

  <p>"Rosina," he pleaded hoarsely, "I was a fool last night, but I had had a
  blow&mdash;a cruel disappointment. I was not myself. I ought not to have left
  you. I know that, but don't be cruel. Can't you see how I am
  suffering&mdash;how it hurts?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head in mystified fashion. She did not falter once in the
  part she played.</p>

  <p>"My dear Philip," she expostulated, "you seem to have been imbibing some
  of Uncle Benjamin's Drury Lane spirit. It is very nice of you both to have
  come and looked me up. I can assure you that I feel quite touched that you
  thought it worth while. You can see for yourselves that I am both safe and
  well."</p>

  <p>"Rosina!" he began once more.</p>

  <p>"You won't mind, will you," she interrupted, "if I draw your attention to
  a little matter of detail? I'm afraid you had a bad night, and you seem to
  have got up in a hurry. You have omitted to brush your hair, or your clothes.
  And as for your collar&mdash;well, go and look in a mirror as soon as you
  have an opportunity.&mdash;I am afraid that I must go now. I am having lunch
  with Mr. Erwen and a friend in the grillroom."</p>

  <p>A storm of passion flamed for a moment in Philip's cheeks and eyes.</p>

  <p>"I will see this man Erwen before I leave the place," he declared.</p>

  <p>Again a different Rosina faced him. Her eyes flashed. She was quiet,
  undaunted but convincing. Her voice was raised scarcely above a whisper, but
  every word was poignant and bitter.</p>

  <p>"Philip," she said, "you may have other opportunities of meeting Mr.
  Erwen. For the present, I forbid either of you to intrude upon my friends. I
  have explained exactly how I regard the relations between us, uncle," she
  added, turning to him. "As for you, Philip, you have not the slightest right
  to interfere in my life or anything I choose to do. That is over."</p>

  <p>Her little nod, as she turned away, was half courteous, half pleasant. It
  was unmistakably a nod of dismissal. She moved slowly back across the lounge
  and vanished into the grillroom beyond. Benjamin Stone gripped Philip by the
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Show me the way out of this place, lad," he ordered.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="a-14"
     name="a-14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Miss Jane McAlister, clad in a neat, grey travelling
  costume, with a plain felt hat, a large blue veil, and clutching a shiny
  handbag, sat in a corner of the lounge at the Savoy Hotel, a few days later,
  waiting for the announcement that her taxi was at the door. She was off to
  Paris to interview a great dramatist and attempt something in the nature of a
  scoop, which accounted for her barely concealed impatience. By her side
  Rosina was seated, also apparently ready to depart. For all her impatience,
  Miss McAlister remembered that she had a self-imposed duty to perform before
  she left, a duty which she had put off until the last possible moment. That
  last possible moment, however, had now arrived.</p>

  <p>"Say, Miss Vonet," she began, turning suddenly to Rosina and taking her
  hand, "I want to tell you that I think you're a real nice child."</p>

  <p>"I'm so glad," Rosina murmured, a little taken aback.</p>

  <p>"And because I like you," Jane McAlister continued, "I am going to do what
  isn't much in my line&mdash;I am going to butt right in on another person's
  affairs. I am going to just have a word with you about Mr. Douglas
  Erwen."</p>

  <p>Rosina sat and waited. It seemed to her the safest course.</p>

  <p>"I've known Douglas," Miss McAlister went on, "since he was a baby in his
  country home in Connecticut. I knew him at Harvard, and I placed his first
  play for him when he came to New York. There isn't anything I wouldn't do for
  that boy, and I think he's fond of me, but I'm going to say to you what I'd
  just as lief say before his face, and indeed, if he were here at the present
  moment, I should be talking right on, just the same. Douglas is one of the
  best. He's generous and kind-hearted, and he's quite capable of doing a big
  thing&mdash;a big-hearted thing, I mean. But he slips up, now and then, as
  all of us do, and when he does, there's generally a girl in it."</p>

  <p>Rosina looked almost pleadingly at her companion. Miss Jane McAlister,
  however, was fairly embarked upon her task, and it would have taken more than
  the silent appeal of Rosina's eyes to have stopped her.</p>

  <p>"You're one of those girls," she went on, "whom I have read about, over on
  this side, but haven't really believed existed. You know about as much of the
  world as the dunce pupil in a kindergarten class, and it's a wicked shame
  that you should be knocking about around here with no one to look after you.
  Don't be afraid that I am going to preach to you, because I'm not. We all
  choose our own lives, and there isn't much difference between any two of
  them. We have to decide for ourselves which line we mean to take up, and I
  guess I've met better-hearted people amongst those who've chosen the other
  side of the fence than those who've felt their way along the safe places. You
  get me?"</p>

  <p>"I understand," Rosina murmured.</p>

  <p>"Now Douglas Erwen did the right thing," Miss McAlister continued, "when
  he fetched me out of bed at four o'clock in the morning and handed you over
  to my charge, but I guess he's got over the uplift of it by now. What I want
  you to figure out for yourself is this. He is capable of doing that sort of
  thing once or even twice, but he's just as capable of a slip-up the other
  way. You don't want to trust any man, child, at your age and with your
  looks&mdash;not even Douglas."</p>

  <p>Rosina was looking a little helpless, but she suddenly stretched out her
  hand and the other woman clasped it.</p>

  <p>"Say, I'm glad you're taking this right," the latter went on. "It wasn't
  such a bad thing, perhaps, that Douglas had to go up to Manchester yesterday.
  Have you heard from him?"</p>

  <p>Rosina nodded, and handed over the telegram, crumpled up in her hand,
  which she had received a few minutes before. It was handed in at
  Manchester:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram"><tt>PLEASE STAY ON IN MISS MCALISTER'S ROOMS UNTIL I
  RETURN AT FIVE O'CLOCK THIS AFTERNOON. DOUGLAS ERWEN.</tt></p><br>

  <p>"What are you doing about this?" Miss McAlister asked.</p>

  <p>Rosina pointed through the swing doors to where her modest-looking green
  canvas bag was awaiting its owner.</p>

  <p>"I've packed up," she said simply. "I am leaving when you do."</p>

  <p>"Got a room?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet. I'll soon find one."</p>

  <p>"Got the money to pay rent in advance?" was the next practical
  question.</p>

  <p>"I have about seventeen shillings," Rosina confessed. "I had to give the
  maid upstairs something, and that new frock I wore on Monday night took most
  of my last week's money. I shall draw five pounds again on Friday."</p>

  <p>Jane McAlister sighed.</p>

  <p>"There's another thing I'm going to tell you, kid," she said. "I'm afraid
  you won't like it, but it's better for you to know. The chorus is coming out
  of your show at the Garrick. You'll get your five pounds this week, and
  perhaps next, but that will be the end of it."</p>

  <p>Rosina's heart sank, but the blow was not altogether unexpected.</p>

  <p>"The girls were saying last night that there was a chance of something of
  the sort," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"That's another reason why I spoke to you about Douglas," Miss McAlister
  persisted. "He may pretend he's putting you into something else, and try to
  get you to accept a sort of bogus salary. Don't have anything to do with it.
  I've had twenty years' experience, and I can tell you that you've about as
  much chance of making a living on the stage as I should have. The best thing
  you can do is to make friends with your folk, however hard it may be, and if
  you can't, why, you must get another sort of job.&mdash;And there's my taxi,"
  she went on, rising to her feet, "and you've just got to put this envelope
  into your pocket, and if you're real hard up against it at any time, why,
  just open it, and remember that you owe an old woman a trifle and pay her
  when you can.&mdash;Say, these porters are none too slick, are they!" she
  concluded, as she waddled towards the door. "I'll just make the dep&ocirc;t,
  and that's about all. Good-by and good luck!"</p>

  <p>Miss Jane McAlister was gone in a whirl of admonitions, complaints and
  expostulations. Rosina stood looking after her departing taxicab with a lump
  in her throat and a curious sense of loneliness. She dropped the envelope
  into her handbag, with no thought of opening it.</p>

  <p>"Shall I call you a cab, miss?" the porter asked.</p>

  <p>Rosina picked up her bag. It was really ridiculously light.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said, "I am not going far."</p>

  <p>Douglas Erwen came down to the theatre that evening a little late, and
  made his way at once to where Rosina was standing in the wings.</p>

  <p>"You got my telegram?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"It was very kind of you," she said.</p>

  <p>"But you didn't wait?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think a suite at the Savoy is a very suitable abode for me, do
  you?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't half good enough."</p>

  <p>"Well, I have found what my landlady, who has been on the stage, describes
  as a bed-sitter, close to New Oxford Street," she confided. "It's on the
  sixth storey. I have a beautiful view, a gas cooking stove, and she's going
  to let me have a strip of carpet next week, if she approves of me. All this
  for twenty-five shillings a week. If I can't earn enough to pay for that, I
  don't deserve to be alive."</p>

  <p>"You know about the trouble here, then?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Of course! I've been awfully grateful for these few weeks. I don't think
  I'm a bit of good on the stage."</p>

  <p>"Has Jane been talking to you?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Miss McAlister has said nothing about you or me or anything that wasn't
  entirely sweet," she declared.</p>

  <p>"But she has been talking?"</p>

  <p>"She said just the sort of things to me that a nice old woman who knew the
  world should say to a girl who didn't."</p>

  <p>"She's a dear, silly old juggins!" Erwen scoffed. "I suppose you're scared
  stiff of me now?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit," she laughed. "I like you far too well."</p>

  <p>"Do you like me well enough to come and have a sandwich when the show's
  over?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course I do," she assured him. "I shall love to come."</p>

  <p>"Capital! I'm glad you're not going to be absurd about things.&mdash;Why
  are you gazing at that box so intently?"</p>

  <p>She turned towards him, her eyes full of amused questioning. Her fingers
  rested upon his arm.</p>

  <p>"Tell me exactly what you think of those three?" she begged.</p>

  <p>"Friends of yours?" he asked cautiously.</p>

  <p>"I've only seen one of them before in my life."</p>

  <p>"I pass over the youth," he decided, after a few moments' scrutiny. "He is
  unfortunate but he can't be helped, and I dare say, if he goes to the right
  sort of school and gets the right sort of dressing down, he may improve. All
  the same, he shouldn't sit with his hands in his pockets."</p>

  <p>"The woman?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"His mother, obviously. Not at all bad-looking, of her type;
  opulent&mdash;by Jove, she has really fine diamonds!&mdash;a little
  overdressed, probably a little under-bred. City man's wife, or something of
  that sort, I should imagine."</p>

  <p>"And her escort?"</p>

  <p>"Harder to place," Erwen confessed. "He goes to a good tailor and he's not
  bad-looking. Rather a strong face, in its way. I don't like his eyes, though.
  He's no fool, anyhow. Why are you interested in them?"</p>

  <p>"Less than twelve months ago," Rosina confided, "that young man in the
  box, Philip Garth&mdash;you met him the other night, you know&mdash;and I
  came to London together to seek our fortunes. We all had an equal start. I
  think he's the winner, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"I should say he's got his neck ahead," Erwen admitted. "There's your
  call, child. On you go, and don't look so serious about it. I'm off round to
  the back. See you at ten minutes past eleven."</p>

  <p>They sat in the balcony at Ciro's, and Rosina, besides enjoying her simple
  supper, watched the dancing below with the keenest interest. Matthew was
  there with the lady whom he had escorted to the theatre&mdash;the boy had
  evidently been sent home. Rosina watched with delight his stiff, correct
  steps when he stood up to dance&mdash;the obvious product of a modern dancing
  school. Once their eyes met. She smiled and waved her hand, and Matthew
  responded in more dignified fashion.</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear, I've done it now!" she exclaimed, leaning back in her chair.
  "Of course, I ought not to have looked near him. I could see his partner ask
  who I was&mdash;a chorus girl having supper with a man alone! Poor Matthew! I
  hope I haven't spoilt his chances."</p>

  <p>"I should say you'd improved them," Erwen replied drily. "There isn't much
  of the chorus girl stamp about you, especially as we understand it over in
  the States."</p>

  <p>Rosina made a grimace at herself in the mirrored wall.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I'm too shabby," she reflected.</p>

  <p>"The hall-mark of respectability," he reminded her.</p>

  <p>She smoothed the shiny part of her sleeve and glanced at the many-times
  mended gloves which lay upon the table.</p>

  <p>"It's an unpleasant hall-mark," she sighed.</p>

  <p>"Of a spurious state," he rejoined.</p>

  <p>She looked at him thoughtfully. He was a personable escort, tall and
  broad-shouldered, with strong, intellectual face, a little tired about the
  eyes, his lips perhaps a trifle full, but with qualities of attractiveness
  beyond the ordinary modicum of good looks.</p>

  <p>"We all three," she mused, "had respectability thrust down our throats at
  Norchester, from morning till night. Did I ever tell you that my uncle
  preached in the chapel, and conducted family prayers, kneeling upon a
  horsehair sofa, twice a day?"</p>

  <p>"Holy smoke!" Erwen murmured.</p>

  <p>"We ran away from Norchester to get rid of our glut of the quality," she
  went on. "Philip is doing very well, but I rather fancy that Matthew is
  developing his in a different strain. I suppose they both look upon me as the
  black sheep who has really succeeded in our enterprise. By-the-by, did I tell
  you that my Uncle Benjamin and Philip both came to the Savoy on Tuesday
  morning?"</p>

  <p>"I guessed it," he answered. "You took the card from the porter, you know.
  They asked for me, but you said it was a mistake and you went down yourself.
  Well, what had they to say?"</p>

  <p>"Just what you might imagine," she replied.</p>

  <p>"You explained everything?"</p>

  <p>"I explained nothing."</p>

  <p>"Say, I don't follow you," he declared. "You'd a perfectly straight tale
  for them, with Miss McAlister and me on hand to corroborate it. Why not let
  them have it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she admitted, looking across at him with rather a sad
  little smile upon her lips. "I did what I think I shall always do in
  life&mdash;I acted on impulse. I said the words I felt ready there for me to
  say."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to trust to your impulse wherever you may find yourself in
  life?" he asked, dropping his voice a little.</p>

  <p>"I think so," she answered meditatively.</p>

  <p>He called for his bill a little abruptly. Rosina leaned over the balcony
  and watched the dancers. Matthew and his opulent-looking companion were still
  making their measured progress round the room. Every one down there suddenly
  seemed like puppets in an unreal show. She herself, in her shabby frock, her
  cheap little hat, her patched shoes, thrust cautiously out of sight, was the
  only real person in the place. She felt suddenly very lonely.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="a-15"
     name="a-15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Matthew, after a very disturbing few days spent amongst
  familiar but distasteful scenes, returned from Norchester a day earlier than
  he was expected and made his way at once to the very handsomely appointed
  office where the two partners of the firm, when they were in the city at all,
  were generally to be found. On this occasion, it happened that both were
  present. Mr. Nettleby, not yet settled down after his two months' absence on
  the Riviera, was seated in an easy-chair, smoking a cigarette and reading the
  <i>Sportsman</i>. Mr. Faringdon, with the air of one immersed in great
  affairs, was dictating some letters to a secretary.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Garner," the latter said, pausing for a moment from his
  labours. "I didn't know you were expected back so soon."</p>

  <p>"I caught the eight o'clock train from Norchester this morning, sir,"
  Matthew explained. "I should be glad if I could have a word with you and Mr.
  Nettleby."</p>

  <p>Mr. Faringdon signified to his secretary his desire that she should
  withdraw. Matthew looked around to be sure that she had closed the door
  behind her.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Garner, and get on with it," Mr. Nettleby invited, laying down
  his paper. "I am lunching up west at a quarter past one. I believe I hear the
  car now."</p>

  <p>"I would rather stand, for the present, if you don't mind, sir," Matthew
  replied. "I have come to tender my resignation."</p>

  <p>"Your resignation?" Mr. Faringdon gasped.</p>

  <p>"The devil!" Mr. Nettleby echoed.</p>

  <p>"It is my duty," Matthew declared.</p>

  <p>"But I don't understand this," Mr. Faringdon protested. "Are you not
  satisfied with your position? We were saying, only this morning, that no one
  has ever entered our employ and made such rapid progress as you."</p>

  <p>"I have been more than satisfied," Matthew assured them. "I had looked
  forward to devoting the whole of my life and energies to the service of the
  firm. I have a confession to make, however, of which I am heartily
  ashamed."</p>

  <p>"Goodness gracious!" Mr. Nettleby exclaimed. "You haven't been embezzling
  or anything, have you?"</p>

  <p>"It is my ability, not my honesty, which is in question," Matthew replied.
  "I considered that I had made a matter of seven or eight thousand pounds'
  profit to the firm in my deal with Benjamin Stone. I looked upon myself as a
  keen man of business, and upon Benjamin Stone as a man in serious
  difficulties, driven into a corner by his own obstinacy and narrow-minded
  methods. I have been deceived."</p>

  <p>"Let's hear about it, Garner," Mr. Nettleby said, "only," he added,
  glancing at the clock, "don't make it too long a story."</p>

  <p>Matthew moved his position slightly and stood with his hands gripping the
  heavy back of one of the old-fashioned mahogany chairs. He spoke slowly but
  he chose his words well. There was an undernote of bitterness which crept out
  now and then.</p>

  <p>"When we decided, on the figures I showed you," he began, "to manufacture
  for ourselves in Norchester the goods which we had been buying from Benjamin
  Stone and Company, and if possible to purchase that business, I went down to
  Norchester quietly and got into communication with Mulholland, the
  confidential cashier and clerk of the firm. Mulholland is a man who has been
  at the factory for thirty years, and has had about three rises all that time.
  I know his salary, because, when I was at work there, I made it my business
  to know all these things&mdash;and it was a miserable one. He came to dine
  with me at the hotel, and directly I began to hint at what I was after, he
  more than met me halfway. I do not wish to take up your time, gentlemen, so I
  will not enter into the details of our conversation. In the end, I offered
  him fifty pounds to take stock at the factory quietly and hand me the
  results. He accepted at once. On the strength of his figures, I made my deal
  on your behalf with Benjamin Stone, instead of waiting and having the thing
  arranged by valuation in the ordinary way of business."</p>

  <p>"You had our consent to that course," Mr. Faringdon remarked. "It was
  unusual, but we had the money lying idle, and the sooner the deal was carried
  through, the better. We&mdash;er&mdash;certainly understood, however, that
  you were obtaining an agreement from Benjamin Stone, undertaking that the
  factory should be locked up and the keys handed to you, without any goods
  being disturbed, the moment the deposit money was paid."</p>

  <p>"That part of the affair was quite all right, sir," Matthew replied. "The
  factory was closed down within half an hour of my paying over the deposit
  money. It is the figures supplied to me by Mulholland that are wrong. They
  were deliberately compiled for purposes of deception. A lot of useless
  machinery was included, and the whole of the stock of leather and boots,
  contrary to my express request, was put down at selling and not cost
  prices."</p>

  <p>"Hm! Have you seen this man Mulholland since?" Mr. Faringdon enquired.</p>

  <p>For the first time a faint flush of colour stole into Matthew's cheeks.
  The memory of that interview was not a pleasant one.</p>

  <p>"I saw him at his house last night, sir. He admitted at once that the
  figures which he had given me were unreliable. His attitude was most
  unbusinesslike and absurd. His view was that what I had proposed to him
  amounted to a conspiracy against his employer, and he had therefore
  retaliated by furnishing me with false figures. He showed me a receipt from
  the Norchester Infirmary for the fifty pounds I had paid him."</p>

  <p>Mr. Faringdon scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>"Do you imagine," he asked, "that this fellow Stone knew that the figures
  which you had obtained from his clerk were inflated?"</p>

  <p>"I should think it very likely," Matthew answered bitterly. "He's much too
  shrewd to admit it, though, and I am afraid that, under the circumstances, we
  have no redress against him. I waited for an hour and a half to see him last
  night, whilst he was holding some sort of a service at his chapel, and I did
  my best to try and get him to consent to amend the agreement. I might just as
  well have talked to a lump of granite."</p>

  <p>Mr. Nettleby was polishing his eyeglass carefully with a corner of his
  silk handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"Seems as though this Johnny Mulholland, or whatever his name is, has sold
  us a pup," he remarked.</p>

  <p>Matthew was puzzled&mdash;the phrase was unfamiliar to him.</p>

  <p>"If Mulholland's figures had been correct," he pointed out, "we should
  have made a net profit of about seven thousand pounds, besides having bought
  the factory and plant at a reasonable figure. As it is, I reckon that we have
  paid four thousand, five hundred pounds too much, which sum may have
  eventually to be written off as an actual loss on the transaction."</p>

  <p>Mr. Nettleby glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Rotten bad luck," he admitted, "but isn't that about what your figures
  proved that we should save in a year by manufacturing instead of buying?"</p>

  <p>"We shall save more than that," Matthew assured them, "when the factory is
  brought up to date."</p>

  <p>The partners exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you would like me to leave you for a few minutes, gentlemen?"
  Matthew suggested.</p>

  <p>"I scarcely think that it is necessary," Mr. Faringdon replied. "I believe
  that Mr. Nettleby&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I say let's make the best of it," the latter interrupted, "that is, if
  you're agreeable, Arthur?"</p>

  <p>"I am quite agreeable," Mr. Faringdon assented. "It is a baddish blunder,
  of course, Garner, but it is your first, so we'll let it go at that."</p>

  <p>"I shall do my best," Matthew promised them, "to make it up."</p>

  <p>Mr. Nettleby took down his hat and drew on his gloves with obvious
  relief.</p>

  <p>"That's all right, then," he declared. "I must come down and have a look
  at the place sometime, Garner, when you get it going.&mdash;Can I give you a
  lift anywhere, Arthur?"</p>

  <p>"I am lunching down here, thanks," his partner replied, with an air of
  self-conscious virtue. "I have promised to see an Australian buyer who is
  coming in this afternoon. You had better be in the way too, Garner. He is
  looking out for boots and shoes."</p>

  <p>"I'll toddle off, then," Mr. Nettleby said. "If I decide not to come back
  this afternoon, I'll telephone."</p>

  <p>"Really no need for you to," Mr. Faringdon observed genially. "Garner has
  that Manchester business in hand."</p>

  <p>"Good!" Mr. Nettleby declared. "I shall very likely look in at Prince's
  for an hour, then. Must get some exercise, these days."</p>

  <p>Matthew went back to his own little office in a thoughtful frame of mind.
  Following out the self-instilled precepts of his earlier days, he made it his
  business to know most things, and he had discovered that Mr. Nettleby's share
  of the profits for the last year had amounted to something like thirty
  thousand pounds, and Mr. Faringdon's to even a little more than that sum.
  Neither of these men would have been worth a clerk's wages, under ordinary
  conditions. If the business were worth so much when it was run practically by
  the staff, what might it not become under suitable leadership? He had made a
  bold stroke that day by treating his employers with almost unnecessary
  candour. The result, as he had estimated, was completely successful. It had
  only increased their confidence in him. In a few days he would show them how
  he proposed to recover that four thousand pounds, and more. He had made up
  his mind to get his name upon the deed of partnership by the end of the year.
  The firm had no need of capital, of which he had none, but of brains and
  initiative, with which he was well endowed. There was a way, too, by which he
  might pass at once from the position of a junior partner to the equal of
  these others. Jeremiah Ford, on his death, two years ago, had left a fortune
  of seven hundred thousand pounds, mostly invested in the business. Matthew,
  at the cost of a shilling, had read his will and had made good use of his
  introduction to the household. He was even that night engaged to dine with
  his widow, in whose name stood a goodly two thirds of the shares in the
  business. A matter of twenty years' difference in their ages, and half a
  million in their fortunes were not by any means insuperable obstacles.</p>

  <p>In one of his rare fits of restlessness, Matthew presently left his office
  and embarked upon a systematic perambulation of the immense building. He
  passed from floor to floor of the warehousing departments, where thousands of
  stout shelves seemed to groan under their weight of cloth and clothing,
  merchandise of every description. Even though this were the statutory dinner
  hour, the place still seemed like a hive of industry. In every room, packers
  were at work; clerks in the glass-fronted offices were busy with their
  daybooks. He made use of the automatic lifts to traverse storey after storey.
  He walked for over a mile across the floors of an interminable series of
  rooms&mdash;some fitted with great racks full of stock, others piled to the
  roof with bales of raw material&mdash;over a mile of freehold premises in the
  heart of the City of London, premises free of mortgage, the actual property
  of the firm. Out in the private yard, a score of drays and vans was loading
  and unloading, even at this quiet hour of the day; electric cranes were at
  work; every mechanical device that the mind of man could conceive was there
  to facilitate the handling of the endless stream of cases and bales. He
  passed through the wonderful export department, divided into four
  sections&mdash;north, south, east and west; watched foreigners from every
  nation at work, specialists who knew the trade of the rivers of Malay, the
  demands from China, the needs of the South Sea Islands. And finally he
  descended to the ground floor, to the counting houses which had all the
  gravity and dignity of a banking establishment, where a hundred clerks were
  buried in their books, and the classic stillness was broken only by the
  shrill jangle of scores of typewriters. So, back to his own office to find a
  telephone message upon his table&mdash;Mrs. Ford hoped that Mr. Garner was
  back from the country and would not forget that he was dining with her that
  evening. Twenty years' difference in their ages&mdash;half a million of
  money! Matthew, who had come in temporarily abashed from his pilgrimage, felt
  suddenly master of his fate again. He forgot that he had had no lunch. He
  took his seat before his desk and began gathering into his hand, one by one,
  the levers of which other hands had wearied.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="a-16"
     name="a-16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Rosina was conscious of a little throb of disappointment
  when, after her hurried exit from the theatre, she reached the street to find
  no one waiting at the end of the covered way. It was a wet night, the
  majority of the theatres were not yet emptied of their audiences, and
  pedestrians were few. The thin, tall figure which she had looked for so
  eagerly was certainly nowhere in sight. She had humbled herself for nothing.
  Philip had neither deigned to send her a line of excuse nor to come, as she
  had begged him, to see her home this last night of her engagement at the
  theatre.</p>

  <p>She hesitated, half inclined to go back again for a little time. The
  performance was not over except so far as the chorus was concerned, and some
  of the girls would be loitering about in the dressing rooms for the next
  half-hour. Although Rosina had formed no friendship with any of them, they
  were at least good-natured and human. The thought of these rain-splashed
  streets and her own comfortless little room was peculiarly distasteful. She
  had, indeed, half turned back when a familiar voice hailed her.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Rosina?"</p>

  <p>It was not the voice which she had been longing to hear, but she turned at
  once to meet the man who had stepped out from under the portico of the
  theatre. He was carrying an umbrella to protect his silk hat and evening
  clothes, and he held it out to shelter her.</p>

  <p>"Matthew!" she exclaimed. "Have you been seeing the show again?"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I have not," he replied. "I seldom see a show twice,
  if I can help it. I am with some friends at the Alhambra, and I strolled
  across here, a few moments ago, on the chance of seeing something of
  you."</p>

  <p>"That was very nice of you," she declared, without enthusiasm. "By-the-by,
  you haven't heard anything of Philip lately, have you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all," he answered shortly.</p>

  <p>"I wrote and asked him to meet me here to-night," she explained. "We had a
  quarrel a short time ago, and I came to the conclusion that it was time we
  made it up."</p>

  <p>Matthew looked around. The rain was coming down faster than ever, and
  pedestrians were mostly grouped together for shelter in various places.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's your lookout," he observed. "Anyway, he's not here. I should
  like to talk to you sometime, Rosina. You might like to hear about Uncle
  Benjamin. He was at the office again yesterday&mdash;came to get the rest of
  his money, and seemed to want it pretty badly. He asked about you."</p>

  <p>"Did he?" Rosina remarked, a little coldly. "I'm afraid I'm not
  enthusiastic about Uncle Benjamin. I'm surprised he even mentioned my name. I
  should have thought, after that morning at the Savoy, that he would have
  wiped me out of his memory."</p>

  <p>"What morning at the Savoy?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "Too long a story!"</p>

  <p>"Quite right," he agreed. "Besides, I must be getting back to the
  Alhambra. I just slipped out, on the excuse of securing a taxicab. Let's dine
  together to-morrow night and you can tell me all about it."</p>

  <p>Rosina hesitated. She was at that healthy age, and full of those healthy
  instincts, when a good dinner is a distinct attraction. She had no other
  engagement, nor was she likely to have, and the thought of a scratch meal in
  her bed-sitting-room was not in the least alluring. Yet for a moment she
  wavered. Matthew had been too clever&mdash;perhaps cunning was the better
  word&mdash;to wholly commit himself. He had never said a word to which she
  could take exception, yet every instinct which she possessed seemed to be in
  arms against him. He saw her hesitation, perhaps he appraised it.</p>

  <p>"I make no promises," he said slowly, "but, of us three, I am, of course,
  the one who has done well. It was always a certainty, although Philip was so
  cock-ahoop about his stories and his poems. I do not admit any obligation,
  although we were brought up together and all that, but it is possible that I
  might be of service not only to you but to Philip, if we had a little
  conversation."</p>

  <p>"To Philip?" she repeated eagerly. "I'll come, with pleasure, Matthew.
  Whereabouts?"</p>

  <p>"You seem rather fond of Ciro's," he remarked, with a meaning smile. "Will
  you dine with me there at eight o'clock?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," she agreed. "I sha'n't be smart, you know, like the lady I
  saw you with the other night."</p>

  <p>"That is of no consequence," he assured her. "Besides, it would naturally
  be impossible. That lady has an income of twenty thousand a year. She is the
  widow of one of the late partners of the firm. In your way, Rosina," he
  added, "you will look better than any one else in the room."</p>

  <p>He had lowered his voice a little. There was a note in it which she had
  never heard before, and to which she listened now with a certain
  uneasiness.</p>

  <p>"Compliments from you, Matthew!" she laughed. "Don't think it necessary,
  please! I'll be there at eight o'clock."</p>

  <p>Matthew raised his hat and hurried off. Rosina was on the point of turning
  up Charing Cross Road when a familiar figure came hurrying down the private
  way from the stage door, and Douglas Erwen seized her arm with a glad
  whoop.</p>

  <p>"Say, I thought I'd missed you, little girl!" he exclaimed. "They kept me
  so long round at the front, and you must have changed like lightning."</p>

  <p>"I did change quickly," she admitted. "I had written and asked some one to
  meet me. He hasn't come and I am very disappointed."</p>

  <p>"Why, I saw you talking to some one, didn't I?"</p>

  <p>"It was some one else, whom I didn't particularly want to see," she
  replied.</p>

  <p>"And who was the lucky person you did send for?"</p>

  <p>"The young man whom I brought to the party&mdash;Philip Garth."</p>

  <p>Erwen made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"Well," he remarked, "you can't expect me to sympathise with you. Let's
  get along to Ciro's and have some supper."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so to-night. I am tired and I am disappointed."</p>

  <p>He opened the door of his car, which was waiting.</p>

  <p>"You aren't going to walk home in this storm, anyhow," he insisted, "so
  get in, please."</p>

  <p>She obeyed, and he took his place by her side.</p>

  <p>"Where did you tell the man to drive to?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"The Savoy," he answered firmly. "You'll have to have some supper, whether
  you want to or not."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why you bother about me," she sighed. "I suppose I am hungry,
  though, when I come to think of it."</p>

  <p>"Anything since luncheon?"</p>

  <p>"A cup of tea."</p>

  <p>"And luncheon?"</p>

  <p>"An egg and some bread and butter."</p>

  <p>He groaned.</p>

  <p>"Say, do you starve yourself because you think it's the fashion to be
  thin?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I hate starving myself," she replied. "I'm nearly always hungry, too. Now
  I am really going to have supper, I am delighted about it. And to-morrow
  night I am going to dine at Ciro's. Of course, so far as restaurants are
  concerned, I'm living far above my station!"</p>

  <p>"And who the mischief are you dining at Ciro's with?"</p>

  <p>"With Matthew Garner, the other young man with whom I was brought up. You
  saw him in a box at the theatre, you know. He is going to tell me things
  about my Calvinistic uncle, and we are going to talk over our early days at
  Norchester."</p>

  <p>"I'm not particularly struck on that Matthew of yours," Erwen
  reflected.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure that I am, either," she rejoined, "but, after all, we were
  brought up together, and I think he means to be nice to me, in his way."</p>

  <p>"The question is&mdash;how nice?" Erwen grumbled. "I want to be nice to
  you myself."</p>

  <p>"Well, how nice do you want to be?"</p>

  <p>She suddenly felt her hand in his strong fingers.</p>

  <p>"Can't you guess, Rosina?" he whispered.</p>

  <p>The car had drawn up before the entrance to the Savoy. Rosina snatched her
  hand away and laughed.</p>

  <p>"I'm much too hungry for conundrums," she declared. "Can I have a really
  brown cutlet and some peas? And let's get a corner table where I shall be out
  of sight. I should have put on my other frock, only I expected to be supping
  with Philip at an A. B. C."</p>

  <p>"You shall have everything you want that I can give you," he promised, as
  he guided her slightly by the arm towards the bowing <i>ma&icirc;tre
  d'h&ocirc;tel</i>.</p>

  <p>They had their corner table, the cutlets were done exactly as she liked
  them, and he made her drink a glass of wine. There was an air of languorous
  warmth about the room, very pleasant after the rain-swept streets outside.
  Rosina almost forgot her disappointment. Once, however, she started and
  turned pale. In the dark gulf of the courtyard, she suddenly fancied that she
  saw a familiar face, livid and menacing, pressed against the thick glass
  window.</p>

  <p>"Who was that?" she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>Erwen glanced carelessly out.</p>

  <p>"Some loiterer," he answered. "There are always plenty of them about."</p>

  <p>Her vague apprehensions disappeared. She looked around her with immense
  content.</p>

  <p>"My spirits," she declared, "are rising. Soon I shall forget the tragedy
  of the evening. When some one writes my memoirs," she went on meditatively,
  "they will probably point out that mine was the briefest career on the stage
  ever known. Can't you write something with a real chorus in it, please?"</p>

  <p>"Look here, Rosina," her companion said, squaring his shoulders as he
  leaned across the table, "if I had a show coming on, with a chorus, you
  should have a part if you wanted it, but, honestly, you don't amount to
  anything on the stage&mdash;you'd never make good. You haven't the flair for
  it, and never would have."</p>

  <p>Rosina sighed.</p>

  <p>"I never thought I was anything wonderful," she admitted, "but five pounds
  a week is such a lot of money to earn."</p>

  <p>"Five pounds a week is nothing at all," he scoffed. "I wish I could give
  you ten times that. I could if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If what?"</p>

  <p>"If you were my sister, or some relative who would be justified in
  receiving an allowance from me," he replied, after a moment's somewhat
  singular pause.</p>

  <p>Rosina's large eyes were filled with self-pity.</p>

  <p>"And the only relative I have in the world doesn't seem in the least
  inclined to make me an allowance of any sort," she murmured. "Do you think
  you could adopt me, Mr. Erwen?"</p>

  <p>"Douglas, please."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't do it. You're too great a personage."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish! About adopting you, Rosina&mdash;well, I consent."</p>

  <p>She gave a little sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"Then I needn't go and look for a post on Monday morning. The thought of
  that greengrocer's shop haunts me."</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest necessity," he assured her.</p>

  <p>"But you're going to America next week."</p>

  <p>"You can come, too."</p>

  <p>"I should be seasick," she declared. "Besides&mdash;after all, I am afraid
  you are too young to have a ward."</p>

  <p>"I'll wear a grey wig," he suggested. "I was on the stage once. I can make
  up to look fifty at least."</p>

  <p>She negatived the idea promptly.</p>

  <p>"I hate deceit," she confessed. "No, we must wait."</p>

  <p>"Wait? What for?"</p>

  <p>"Until you are old enough for me to be your ward. And then, alas! I shall
  be too old for you to want me to be."</p>

  <p>"You're talking nonsense," he complained irritably.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you?" she replied, laughing at him.</p>

  <p>He waited whilst they were served with some asparagus. Then he looked
  across at her.</p>

  <p>"No!" he said firmly.</p>

  <p>Rosina sighed in aggrieved fashion.</p>

  <p>"That makes it so difficult. Fancy serving us with asparagus in the middle
  of a discussion like this! I am coming to the conclusion that you are a very
  bad companion for me. You are giving me extravagant tastes."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing in the world too good for you, Rosina," he insisted.</p>

  <p>"I love the sentiment," she replied. "I often try to feel that way
  myself&mdash;but there are difficulties. Imagine going out on Monday morning
  to look for a situation, after a meal like this!"</p>

  <p>"Why go, then? You needn't."</p>

  <p>"The alternative seems to be to sit in my room and wait for a situation to
  come to me," she pointed out. "I fancy I should soon starve."</p>

  <p>"If you won't be my ward, will you be my secretary?"</p>

  <p>Rosina considered the matter for a moment.</p>

  <p>"That's quite an interesting suggestion," she acknowledged. "The trouble
  is that my typing really isn't good, my shorthand is worse, and my spelling
  is abominable."</p>

  <p>"I'll risk all that," he assured her, a little unsteadily. "Any other
  objections?"</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes and looked at him.</p>

  <p>"Just one," she said.</p>

  <p>His fingers were gripping the sides of the table. He leaned a little
  forward. The eyes into which he was gazing were surely the most beautiful in
  the world.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he demanded, almost roughly.</p>

  <p>"That you are far too sweet and dear ever to want me to be," she told him,
  with a little catch in her throat.</p>

  <p>He looked down at the tablecloth&mdash;anywhere to escape from the
  sweetness of her heart-troubled look. There was a plaintive note in her
  voice, too, which thrilled whilst it hurt. All the structure of his little
  world, its flimsy edifices, its haunted chambers, its man-accepted
  conventions, seemed to crumble to pieces like a house of cards. There was a
  soft atmosphere of Paradise about their table. The rest of the restaurant was
  a blatant place. It seemed suddenly to become disfigured in his thoughts, and
  the men and women who crowded it&mdash;so many of them, alas! the friends of
  his daily life&mdash;a sordid and soulless crowd. He said nothing, but
  presently he called for the bill and signed it.</p>

  <p>"Will you take your coffee upstairs in my sitting room?" he invited.</p>

  <p>He had never asked her such a thing before, but she accepted without
  hesitation. When they walked out of the room, he seemed to be looking through
  the walls. He forgot to nod to his acquaintances, even to return their
  greetings. Several of them looked after him curiously, others whispered
  jestingly amongst themselves. Neither of the two were even aware of their
  presence. He rang the bell of the lift and handed Rosina in. Arrived on the
  second floor, they passed down the corridor and he threw open the door of his
  little sitting room. There was a fire burning in the grate, an easy-chair
  drawn up to it, cigarettes, magazines, the evening paper, whisky and
  soda&mdash;all the comforts and luxuries that his bachelor existence had
  demanded. He closed the door and laid his hands upon Rosina's shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Rosina," he said, "you won't be my ward and you won't be my secretary. I
  think you know that I offered you those posts with only half my heart. I
  offer you another now with my whole heart. Will you be my wife?"</p>

  <p>Douglas Erwen, although he had had his hours of rhapsodies, had never
  thought much in his life about angels, but he fancied for a single moment
  that he saw one when he watched the light break into her face and the joy
  flash out of her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You darling!" she cried, lifting her lips to his forehead. "Bless you for
  asking me! I can't&mdash;I never could. I love Philip Garth, and some day I
  am going to marry him."</p>

  <p>"That&mdash;boy?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"He's three years older than I am. Perhaps he'll find himself some day. If
  he doesn't, I sha'n't marry at all. It's silly, isn't it, but I love him.
  And&mdash;Douglas&mdash;bless you once more! I feel as though I had been
  wandering through a miserable, dark wood all the evening, and you have
  brought me out into the sunshine. I shall bless you for it all my life."</p>

  <p>He moved to the fireplace and rang the bell. Then he wheeled up an
  easy-chair.</p>

  <p>"Well, dear little friend," he said, "then that's over. I've rung for
  coffee."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="a-17"
     name="a-17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Rosina, without doubt, had the faculty for pleasure. She
  enjoyed her dinner at Ciro's on the following night, even though Matthew was
  her somewhat stolid and at times disquietingly mysterious companion. She even
  enjoyed dancing with him, doing her best to impart some elasticity into his
  stiff but precise movements. The times which she liked least were the
  intervals they spent between the dances, when Matthew ventured upon
  occasional clumsy compliments, and, with rare gallantry, had once even
  possessed himself of her hand. He had at such times a somewhat portentous
  air, as though there were something he desired to say. It was not until the
  evening was well advanced, however, that Rosina, a little fatigued with
  dancing, gave him an opportunity.</p>

  <p>"What has become of Philip?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I wish I knew," she answered sadly. "To tell you the truth, Matthew," she
  went on, "I have been very angry with Philip. I took him to Mr. Erwen's party
  at the Savoy, and he behaved very badly."</p>

  <p>Matthew nodded.</p>

  <p>"Go on. I want to hear all about it."</p>

  <p>"He insisted upon leaving early," she continued, "and he refused to see me
  home. Then I did a very foolish thing. I stayed on there, dancing, until four
  o'clock. Mr. Erwen drove me back to the hostel, and, when we got there, the
  matron, who had always hated me, refused to let me in."</p>

  <p>Matthew, who had been listening with indifferent politeness, was suddenly
  interested.</p>

  <p>"Well, what happened?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Erwen took me back to the Savoy," she explained, "and knocked up a
  dear old lady, who let me sleep upon her sofa. I remained there for two or
  three days, and did a little secretarial work for her."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he murmured. "Go on?"</p>

  <p>"On the first morning, if you please, Uncle Benjamin and Philip arrived at
  the hotel, the former with an ash stick and his usual ecclesiastical attire,
  and Philip looking as though he had slept in his clothes for a week. It seems
  that they went down to the hostel to find me and heard of my escapade from
  the matron. Whereupon, they came to the Savoy and demanded to see Mr.
  Erwen."</p>

  <p>Matthew smiled, mirthlessly yet with obvious appreciation of the
  situation.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I think," Rosina went on, "that for the first time in my life I really
  lost my temper. Philip had deserted me the night before, had behaved like a
  selfish pig to me, had left me outside his rooms and advised me to go back to
  the Savoy&mdash;this, after I had done everything I could to make the evening
  pleasant for him, and after he had refused even to see me home! And Uncle
  Benjamin&mdash;frankly, Matthew, his appearance there, with anger and
  suspicion written all over his face, and with Scripture trembling upon his
  lips, made me positively furious."</p>

  <p>"You explained everything, of course?"</p>

  <p>"I explained nothing," Rosina declared. "I told them both, in the plainest
  words I could find, what I thought of them. I let them think just what they
  liked, and I sent them away. That's the last I've seen of Philip."</p>

  <p>"Serves him right," Matthew agreed heartily.</p>

  <p>"I'm a weak creature, though," Rosina confessed, "and I'm getting very
  unhappy about it. I wrote and told him that I would explain everything, and
  begged him to come and meet me on my last night at the theatre. As you know,
  he didn't come, and I haven't even heard from him. I have even humbled myself
  so far as to go three times to his room. Each time it was locked and he was
  away."</p>

  <p>"Rosina," her companion said deliberately, "if you'll take my advice,
  you'll let it go at that. Philip is a wastrel. When we three left Norchester
  together, I could foresee the future exactly as it has turned out. Philip was
  bound to fail. There isn't any definite place for his sort in the world. He
  was bound to be a burden on some one, and, because I had no intention that
  that some one should be me, I broke away from both of you after the first six
  months."</p>

  <p>"It was very far-seeing of you," she murmured coldly.</p>

  <p>"I am always far-seeing," Matthew assented. "I build up my future, day by
  day, and I do not make mistakes. But at that time I had no intention of
  deserting you, Rosina. I have always told you that I was willing to be your
  friend."</p>

  <p>"That is very dear of you, Matthew," she said, "but I have no claim upon
  you. We were brought up together, but that tie came to an end when we left
  Norchester. I shall struggle along all right."</p>

  <p>"London," he pointed out, "is not a good place for a girl like you,
  Rosina, to attempt to 'struggle along all right.'"</p>

  <p>"I don't think London is so bad," she rejoined. "People have been very
  nice to me."</p>

  <p>"What about that fellow Erwen?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>She smiled a little tenderly.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Erwen has perhaps been nicer than any one," she said. "He asked me to
  be his wife."</p>

  <p>Matthew set down the glass which he had been in the act of lifting to his
  lips. The information was a shock to him.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" he exclaimed, a little harshly.</p>

  <p>Rosina raised her eyebrows. Her impulse of anger passed at once, however.
  She laughed at the dismay in her companion's face.</p>

  <p>"Don't be rude, Matthew," she enjoined. "Why shouldn't Mr. Erwen ask me to
  marry him? I am really quite attractive, and I have a very nice
  disposition."</p>

  <p>"He asked you to marry him!" Matthew repeated.</p>

  <p>Rosina looked her companion in the face. It was the opportunity which she
  had desired.</p>

  <p>"If he cared for me, Matthew, and I believe that he does, why shouldn't
  he?"</p>

  <p>"These people connected with the stage aren't very great on marriage, as a
  rule," he observed.</p>

  <p>Rosina laughed lightly.</p>

  <p>"My dear Matthew," she expostulated, "what do you know about the stage and
  the men and women who belong to it? Nothing at all! Neither do I, for the
  matter of that. But please believe this. You are busy making money, and I am,
  in my way, finding out something about life. The people who count, the people
  who are really nice, are just the same in any profession. However, we won't
  discuss it any longer. I dare say I could have been quite happy as Douglas
  Erwen's wife, only, you see, unfortunately I am one of those women who never
  change. Philip is my only man. I am very angry with him just now, but that
  really doesn't make any difference. Some day or other I shall marry
  him&mdash;or no one.&mdash;We must dance this one, please."</p>

  <p>She sprang up and led him unwillingly away. The crisis was past. When they
  resumed their seats, the shadow of uneasiness which had rested upon her had
  gone.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about the handsome lady you were here with, the other night?" she
  begged.</p>

  <p>"That was Mrs. Ford," he explained. "She is the widow of one of the late
  partners in the firm. Her husband left her the best part of half a
  million."</p>

  <p>"How wonderful!" Rosina murmured. "And you are very friendly with
  her?"</p>

  <p>"It is my intention to marry her," Matthew announced.</p>

  <p>She leaned back in her cushioned seat and laughed until the tears came
  into her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You amazing person!" she cried. "Are you so fond of her already,
  then?"</p>

  <p>"I am not fond of her at all," Matthew replied, a little sulkily. "I shall
  take very good care of her money, and I shall make her a good husband. For
  the rest, I am not quite so narrow as the Norchester folk. You believe I
  think of nothing but money. I can assure you that I intend to amuse
  myself."</p>

  <p>"Of course you must amuse yourself," she assented. "You are much too
  clever a person not to realise that a narrow devotion to any one thing, even
  money-making, doesn't give you the place you want in the world. Whatever will
  Uncle Benjamin say when he knows that you are marrying a woman with half a
  million!"</p>

  <p>"He will probably try to borrow a little," Matthew observed, with a frown
  of anticipatory annoyance. "I am afraid that he is in very low water."</p>

  <p>"You will help him if he needs it, won't you?" she begged.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," he answered cautiously. "After all, he is only fifty-four
  years old. He ought still to be capable of work. I may try to find him some
  post, if he requires it. With you, Rosina, if you required my assistance, it
  would be a different matter."</p>

  <p>"But I don't&mdash;not at the present moment, at any rate," she assured
  him. "I have three pounds seven in my pocket, and a mysterious packet left me
  by the dear old lady who took me in for the night at the Savoy. I believe it
  contains a bank note. If you wanted to be a perfect angel, Matthew, I would
  ask you to remember for a moment that Saturday afternoon when we all three
  lay under the pine trees and planned our escape. We were all dear friends
  then, weren't we? Couldn't you do something for Philip? You did mention it
  last night, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>Matthew's face darkened.</p>

  <p>"Rosina," he said, "I have been thinking the matter over, but I must tell
  you frankly that I have no feeling for Philip but one of contempt. He is
  lazy, I do not believe in his gifts, and he has no self-control. I do not
  like Philip. I am not disposed to help him."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you just a little hard, Matthew?" she protested.</p>

  <p>"One is generally hard to the person one dislikes," he admitted. "If you
  want help to come to Philip, you can secure it for him. I am willing to make
  you an allowance, if you like, in addition to whatever you may earn. If you
  cared for such a post, I could find you a position in the city as principal
  stenographer or secretary."</p>

  <p>"With the great firm of Faringdon, Nettleby, Ford and Company?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied, "not with my firm."</p>

  <p>"You dear, careful old thing!" she scoffed, good-humouredly. "I believe
  you're afraid of Mrs. Ford, or scandal, and you needn't be. It's kind of you
  to offer me help, Matthew, but I don't need any. I'm a strong young woman,
  with a moderate amount of independence, and the only money I care about is
  the money I earn, until I marry, and then I hope my husband will earn it for
  me."</p>

  <p>"For Philip's sake, you wouldn't be disposed to think over&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not for a moment," she interrupted hastily. "You know very well that
  Philip would rather starve than accept help in that fashion. If your heart
  prompted you to do it, and you could go to him and remind him of our life
  together at Norchester&mdash;after all, we were of one family&mdash;and ask
  to be allowed to give him a leg up for a time, until things went
  better&mdash;well, that would be a different matter."</p>

  <p>"I should never do that," Matthew said doggedly.</p>

  <p>"Then you can keep your money," she laughed. "I want to be friends with
  you, if I can, Matthew," she went on earnestly, "because, after all, we did
  live together for a good many years, and I'm perfectly certain you are not
  such an old money-grubber as you make yourself out to be. But if I want any
  help at any time, and feel that I can, I'll come to you. Let that be the end
  of this sort of discussion, there's a dear. I'm always afraid that we shall
  misunderstand one another&mdash;in some horrible fashion."</p>

  <p>Matthew looked at his plate a little sulkily. The evening had not gone as
  he had anticipated. He felt, somehow or other, that he, the man of affairs,
  the genius of a great firm, had been kept in his place, had been forbidden
  even to set out the things that were in his mind, by a tact and finesse
  against which his own methods of arguments seemed clumsy and obvious. Rosina,
  in her cheap frock and with three pounds seven in her pocket, was easily his
  superior in that more gracious side of life which he was clever enough not to
  underrate.&mdash;He paid his bill with the air of a man who has made a bad
  bargain.</p>

  <p>"They'll be closing in a few minutes," he said. "We may as well go, if
  you're ready. I'm off to Norchester by the newspaper train."</p>

  <p>"You've been a dear to bring me and I have loved it," she declared. "I
  have an appointment myself soon after nine. Wish me luck, Matthew."</p>

  <p>"Luck!" he grumbled, as he followed her out of the room. "You don't know
  it when you see it."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="a-18"
     name="a-18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Douglas Erwen came in from a round of good-by calls, winding
  up with a farewell dinner at Ciro's, and contemplated his little pile of
  luggage in the hall of the Savoy.</p>

  <p>"Everything ready, Astill?" he asked the hall porter.</p>

  <p>"Everything quite ready, sir," the man replied. "The special leaves Euston
  at ten o'clock to-morrow morning. The car will be here at nine. No need to
  start earlier, sir, as your place is booked through."</p>

  <p>Erwen rang the bell for the lift and ascended to his rooms. He let himself
  in, closed the door behind him, entered his sitting room, and, crossing to
  the sideboard, mixed himself a whisky and soda. He was in the act of raising
  it to his lips when the communicating door of his bedroom opened. He stood
  staring at the intruder, half in amazement, half thrilled with that
  consciousness of danger which, to many men, is like an eighth sense. He set
  down his glass.</p>

  <p>"Who the devil are you, and what do you want?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>The intruder came into the room. He was tall, thin, and shabbily dressed.
  His cheeks were unnaturally pale, and his large, deep-set eyes were instantly
  familiar. He was unshaven and unkempt, and he carried without disguise a
  revolver in his hand. His whole appearance was that of a lunatic.
  Nevertheless, when he spoke, his tone was quiet and composed.</p>

  <p>"I am Philip Garth," he announced. "You can guess what I have come
  for."</p>

  <p>Erwen was no coward, but the situation was a desperate one. He measured
  the distance with his eye between himself and the newcomer. The revolver was
  slowly raised.</p>

  <p>"Is it your intention to kill me with that thing?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It is!"</p>

  <p>"You know that you will be hanged?"</p>

  <p>"I shall not," Philip replied, unmoved. "I shall shoot myself
  afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Don't rush this," Erwen begged coolly. "You are a sane man, I suppose. I
  am a person with a sense of justice. Why are you going to kill me&mdash;and
  incidentally yourself?"</p>

  <p>"It is the old story," was the bitter reply. "I have made use of it myself
  in fiction, and you upon the stage&mdash;a woman."</p>

  <p>"Rosina Vonet, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>The pistol was raised a little higher.</p>

  <p>"There is no need to mention her name," Philip muttered. "We both know all
  about it."</p>

  <p>"We don't," Erwen assured him,&mdash;"at least you don't. Sit down in the
  easy-chair there and I'll tell you."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, no!" Philip answered coldly. "There is no need for you to tell
  lies in the last few seconds of your life."</p>

  <p>"There are no lies to be told," Erwen declared. "The truth is quite
  enough."</p>

  <p>"The truth being," Philip said, "that she spent the night of your party,
  and the three succeeding days, here at this hotel; that she supped with you
  here a few nights ago and afterwards came up to your sitting room."</p>

  <p>"You are well informed," Erwen remarked.</p>

  <p>"I was outside in the courtyard," Philip went on. "They wouldn't let me in
  or I should have forced my way to your room. I was drunk that night. I am
  sober now. Is there any message you want to leave? Be quick."</p>

  <p>Erwen was a man of keen observation. There was something in his visitor's
  eyes which puzzled him. Suddenly he realised what it was. It was the whisky
  and soda which he had set down, untasted, and placed at the corner of the
  table.</p>

  <p>"I should like to write a few lines," he said. "I won't keep you longer
  than I can help."</p>

  <p>"You had better not," Philip muttered.</p>

  <p>The writing-table was in the middle of the room. Erwen seated himself,
  drew a sheet of paper towards him, and took up a pen. The whisky and soda was
  on the table, exactly behind him. Philip was about three yards away, with his
  back to the inner door. On the table in front of Erwen stood two little
  trifles which had been given him for a farewell present&mdash;one a heavy
  paper weight, the other a silver-framed mirror. He pushed the latter farther
  back impatiently, as though to make room for his blotting pad. His pen
  scratched across the paper. As he wrote, or pretended to write, he watched
  the little drama behind. Philip, without a doubt, had been suffering tortures
  from his enforced sobriety. The sight of the decanter and of the glass was
  maddening. He drew a step nearer&mdash;another step&mdash;still half watching
  Erwen. Then his left hand was stretched out. He raised the glass to his lips
  with trembling fingers. Erwen continued to write. He made his calculations
  carefully. The time had not yet come to act. His pen went on scratching over
  the rough paper. His attention seemed absorbed by the letter he was writing.
  Behind, the sinister figure hesitated. Then that long left arm went out
  towards the decanter. Silently the tumbler was half filled, there was a
  gurgle of soda water from the syphon. Erwen chose his moment carefully and
  well. Just as Philip was raising the glass to his lips, a trifle off his
  balance, he leaped round with something of the old impetuosity which had made
  him quarterback on the Harvard football team, struck Philip's arm up and
  wrenched the pistol from his hand. It was all over in a matter of five or six
  seconds. Erwen felt the perspiration hot upon his forehead, a deep sense of
  thankfulness in his heart. He was no coward, but no man cares for sudden
  death.</p>

  <p>From the first, Philip recognised the other's physical superiority.
  Deprived of his weapon, he struggled vainly for a moment and then lay inert
  and sullen. Erwen, who was taking no chances, felt him over to see that he
  had no other weapon, then opened the communicating door and threw the pistol
  upon the bed. When he returned, Philip rushed at him furiously, grazing his
  cheekbone with his fist, reaching out with his other hand for the paper
  weight. Erwen, however, mastered him without difficulty, flung him back upon
  the easy-chair, and stood over him, menacing and angry.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "let's understand one another. Is it a lunatic
  asylum or a prison you're looking for?"</p>

  <p>"Neither," was the fierce reply. "I just wanted to kill you, and I shall
  some day, unless you kill me first."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Erwen demanded.</p>

  <p>"You know why!"</p>

  <p>Then, for once in his life, Douglas Erwen let himself go in the matter of
  invective. He spoke without any undue hurry, but he chose his words carefully
  and he saw that each one performed its task. When he had finished, Philip was
  looking more ghastly and shaken than ever, but the madness had gone out of
  his face. He looked like a white man who, in a strange country, has been
  beaten by niggers.</p>

  <p>"I have tried to tell you what I think of you," Erwen wound up. "I hope it
  hurts. I hope you'll never forget my words till the day of your death. You're
  a coward and a sneak and an assassin at heart, or you wouldn't bring murder
  in your hands when you come to deal with the man you fancy has wronged you.
  You're not fit to live in the same world as the girl whose name I should be
  ashamed to utter in your presence. But there it is. She cares for you, so
  you've got to know the truth. On the early morning when I brought her back
  here, I placed her in the charge of an old lady who was a friend of my
  mother's, and she was the guest of that lady&mdash;Miss Jane
  McAlister&mdash;all the time she was here. The night you saw her come out of
  my rooms&mdash;these rooms&mdash;she had had supper with me downstairs and
  she was up here for less than half an hour. During that time I asked her to
  be my wife."</p>

  <p>Philip's face was covered by his hands. Erwen went on relentlessly.</p>

  <p>"I asked her to be my wife and she refused me. Ask yourself whether there
  could ever be a more pitiful reason for refusing an honest man&mdash;the man
  who cared for her. She refused me because she cared for you! I wonder what
  she'd say if she could see you now!"</p>

  <p>Philip rose suddenly to his feet. His eyes were red with weeping, but
  there was a certain dignity in his very resignation.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind letting me go?" he asked. "You are quite right in everything
  you say. I'm not fit to live. I've made the most abominable hash of things,
  and you've made me feel, somehow, as though I'd hurt&mdash;her&mdash;with my
  thoughts. I haven't really&mdash;she's above that&mdash;above me.&mdash;May I
  go?"</p>

  <p>Erwen looked him up and down&mdash;a strange, pathetic figure of broken
  hopes and wasted ambitions. Perhaps he realised some of the tragedy of what
  he saw.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going to?" he enquired. "Have you a home?"</p>

  <p>"What does it matter?" was the despairing reply. "I should be glad if you
  would let me have my pistol. I will not use it against you."</p>

  <p>"You're young to think of shooting yourself," Erwen remarked. "Miss Vonet
  spoke of your having ambitions, of your having written clever stories."</p>

  <p>"Those things are past," Philip answered.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"You can look at me and ask that question?" Philip demanded passionately.
  "I'm broken. I wrote some stories that I thought were good. Some one
  introduced me to a man&mdash;an editor who was starting a new magazine. This
  is my apologia, if you like to take it as such. That man became the curse of
  my life. He bought my stories and published them in a filthy, ill-printed
  magazine, side by side with the worst trash I ever saw in my life. They were
  the first stories I had ever had printed. The disappointment of it nearly
  drove me crazy. And then he was at me all the time to write something that
  would sell&mdash;detective stories&mdash;any sort of melodramatic jumble,
  provided there were murders and thrills enough. He mocked at his public with
  his tongue in his cheek. He had a queer fancy to have me spend a lot of time
  with him, and we spent most of it in public houses, or in the bar of what he
  called a club.&mdash;Oh, I know I ought to have broken away, but I wanted the
  money. I owed Rosina money, and it hurt like hell! Then I had to live. The
  night I behaved like a beast at your party, and afterwards to Rosina, was the
  night my first story appeared in that ghastly magazine."</p>

  <p>"Go on," Erwen invited, and for the first time there was a note of
  sympathy in his voice.</p>

  <p>"The rest is even worse," Philip confessed. "I made no sort of a fight
  against Homan. I put away my novel, I put away my play, I wrote no more
  verses. I just wrote the muck he wanted, and we spent the money together on
  drink. If I hadn't been living such a beastly life, I shouldn't have been so
  ready to believe what I did believe. I'm glad I didn't kill you. I should
  like to go, please, and I should like my pistol."</p>

  <p>"How old are you?" Erwen asked.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-three."</p>

  <p>Erwen lit a cigarette and passed the box to Philip, who, after a brief
  hesitation, accepted one.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-three," he repeated. "And at that age, knowing nothing about life,
  nothing about death, nothing about yourself, you talk of committing suicide,
  without even testing yourself, without knowing whether there's anything in
  you worth keeping alive. I have met knaves and fools in my time. I think that
  you are very nearly the biggest fool who ever bleated."</p>

  <p>"Then the world will be the better for my absence," Philip groaned.
  "'Fools only cumber the ground where wise men might live!'"</p>

  <p>"A very apt quotation, but misleading," Erwen observed drily. "You haven't
  proved yet whether you are a born fool or only a doer of foolish deeds. I am
  inclined to suspect the latter. Look me in the face, young man. I want to see
  whether you are honest."</p>

  <p>Philip's eyes flashed for a moment. Then he remembered.</p>

  <p>"I am honest," he said shortly.</p>

  <p>"It isn't in you to care as much for Rosina Vonet as she deserves, but,
  according to your lights, do you care for her?"</p>

  <p>"I do," Philip answered devoutly. "I'm a drunken, ill-tempered swine, I
  know, but I've never touched any other girl's fingers, or wanted to."</p>

  <p>"Shall I give you a chance?"</p>

  <p>"What sort of a chance? What can you do for me? I couldn't accept
  money&mdash;even as a loan. Rosina isn't likely to look at me again."</p>

  <p>"I'll do better than that for you," Erwen promised. "You're quite right
  about Miss Vonet. After the thoughts you've been harbouring, you've no right
  to go near her for the present. I'll tell you what I will do, though. I'm off
  to America at nine o'clock to-morrow morning. I'll take you with me."</p>

  <p>"You'll what?" Philip gasped.</p>

  <p>"I'll take you with me," Erwen repeated. "You can act as my secretary.
  There's plenty of room on the steamer, as I happen to know. I'll lend you
  some linen. You can buy a suit of clothes in Liverpool. Bring your unfinished
  novel and your unfinished play, and I'll see what stuff you're made of, on
  the way over. One condition, mind&mdash;you take a drink with me when I ask
  you&mdash;no other time."</p>

  <p>Philip rose to his feet. He was shaking in every limb, but he seemed
  somehow to have become transformed. The hope that shone out of his face made
  him look almost pitifully young.</p>

  <p>"You mean this?" he faltered.</p>

  <p>"Of course I do. Get your manuscripts, any clothes that are worth
  bringing, and be here at eight o'clock for breakfast. Do you want any
  money?"</p>

  <p>"I have enough," Philip answered brokenly. "Tell me, why are you doing
  this?"</p>

  <p>"For her sake," Erwen told him. "I am hoping that some day I'll be glad I
  did it for yours. You don't want your pistol now?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't want it."</p>

  <p>"Be a man and keep tight hold of yourself. Will you have a drink before
  you go?"</p>

  <p>Philip shuddered.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," he said. "At eight o'clock&mdash;I'll be here at eight
  o'clock."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Rosina received his farewell in one of two messages which were put into
  her hands late on the following afternoon. There were just four words,
  written on a flimsy telegraph form and handed in at Liverpool Docks:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram"><tt>GOOD-BY. FORGIVE ME. PHILIP.</tt></p><br>

  <p>She opened the second message with trembling fingers. It was handed in at
  the same place and time, but was much longer:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram"><tt>AM TAKING YOUR YOUNG MAN TO NEW YORK WITH ME. IF HE
  HAS THE STUFF IN HIM, WILL SEND HIM BACK TO YOU A MAN. IF HE HASN'T, SHALL
  COME MYSELF. YOU CAN TRUST ME. DOUGLAS.</tt></p><br>

     name="book2">BOOK TWO</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="b-1"
     name="b-1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mademoiselle Hortense Granier&mdash;whose real name, by the
  by, was Harriet Wells&mdash;a person of great authority in the world-famed
  dressmaking establishment of Mathilde, put her head in at one of the
  reception rooms and called to Rosina.</p>

  <p>"Madame wants you in her office," she announced. "There being no customers
  present, I will say 'hurry up' instead of '<i>dep&ecirc;chez-vous!</i>'"</p>

  <p>Rosina, who, during a quiet half-hour, had been practising a new dancing
  step in front of the mirror, brought her heels together and was suddenly
  serious. To be interviewed by Madame was a very undesired honour amongst the
  young ladies of the establishment.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything wrong?" she asked anxiously. "I'm not in trouble, am
  I?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know of anything," the other replied. "Madame's in one of her
  tantrums. That horrid old Egyptian has been worrying her. You're all right,
  though," she added encouragingly. "If the other young persons of the
  establishment," she went on, looking around severely, "took half as much
  interest in their work as you do, instead of talking about their beaux all
  the time, it would add greatly to the credit of the place."</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Hortense's criticisms were received with mingled scorn,
  derision and amusement by the half a dozen fashionably attired young women
  who were waiting to show off the creations of the house to prospective
  customers. Rosina, however, as she hurried away, was full of apprehension.
  The memory of the last eighteen months, its bitter struggles and its constant
  disappointments, was like a nightmare at the back of her mind. Her courage
  was still undaunted, but the idea of being out of employment again, just as
  the winter was coming on, filled her with dread. She tried in vain to think
  of any fault she might have committed, any customer whom she might have sent
  away dissatisfied. Nevertheless, when she knocked at the door of Madame's
  very luxurious boudoir, her knees were trembling.</p>

  <p>"Madame desired to see me," she murmured.</p>

  <p>Madame, who was really a Frenchwoman, and the most famous modiste of her
  day, turned slowly around in her chair. She still possessed the remains of
  wonderful good looks, and, although her figure now defied all the aids of the
  masseuse and the <i>corseti&egrave;re</i>, her deep brown eyes were still
  beautiful, and her glossy hair as black as in the days of her youth.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I wish to speak to you, Miss Vonet," she said. "I have heard
  complaints."</p>

  <p>"Complaints, Madame?" Rosina repeated, feeling that her worst fears were
  about to be realised. "I am very sorry. I have done my best. Please tell
  me&mdash;whom have I offended?"</p>

  <p>Madame looked at her employ&eacute; with slow and critical deliberation.
  She looked at her from head to foot, until Rosina became hot with confusion.
  When at last she spoke, her words were almost a relief.</p>

  <p>"I am not complaining of your general work, Miss Vonet," she said. "You
  appear to give every satisfaction in the salesroom, and your figure remains
  exactly what we want. The complaints I have received are not serious. They
  have more to do with your deportment, and I am sure that, if I give you a
  word of advice, you will be disposed to accept it."</p>

  <p>Rosina felt almost faint with the ending of her suspense. She recovered
  herself speedily, however.</p>

  <p>"I shall welcome your advice, Madame," she assured her.</p>

  <p>"Your position as one of the best-known mannequins of my establishment,"
  Madame continued, "carries with it certain obligations which you are expected
  to fulfill. You have a choice of costumes which you are permitted to wear,
  suitable to any occasion. I find that, whilst my other young ladies are not
  slow to avail themselves of their privileges, you are seldom, if ever, seen
  in public."</p>

  <p>"But, Madame, I have no friends with whom to visit fashionable places,"
  Rosina protested.</p>

  <p>"That is not altogether true," Madame objected. "Mr. Vaculos, who was here
  this morning, complained to me that he had asked you to dine and accompany
  him to the theatre, and that you refused."</p>

  <p>"I do not like Mr. Vaculos," Rosina declared, with some renewal of her
  nervousness.</p>

  <p>"Neither do I," Madame observed drily. "Nevertheless, a great portion of
  the capital with which this business is run belongs to him, and if he were to
  withdraw it, we should find it exceedingly difficult to continue. Do you
  understand me, Miss Vonet?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose I do," Rosina admitted.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Vaculos has never had cause to appeal to me before," Madame
  continued. "The one or two of my young ladies whom he has invited out have
  been only too glad to go. He took that little fair thing, Violet Shaw, to
  Ascot this year, and a sketch of her gowns appeared in several illustrated
  papers and proved an excellent advertisement for the firm. You see, we have
  to think of these things. I cannot remember for the moment that you, who have
  the best figure and most attractive appearance of any of my girls, have ever
  taken advantage of your opportunities in this direction."</p>

  <p>"I lunched twice with Lord Reginald Towers, Madame," Rosina ventured to
  remind her principal. "I wore the pearl-grey chiffon at the Carlton, for
  which you had several enquiries afterwards."</p>

  <p>Madame nodded approvingly.</p>

  <p>"Quite right," she assented. "I had forgotten that for the moment. It only
  shows what you can do when you try. Mr. Vaculos wishes you to dine with him
  to-night, and I desire you to wear the white tulle which came this morning
  from our Paris workshop. I shall drop a line, or telephone, to the
  representatives of one or two of the fashion papers, and if any one does
  speak to you about the gown, of course you know what to say."</p>

  <p>"Madame," Rosina confessed, "I do not like to dine with Mr. Vaculos, but I
  like a great deal less the idea of being out of a situation. It is really
  your wish that I should do so?"</p>

  <p>"It is my wish," Madame said firmly. "You must remember, Miss Vonet," she
  went on, "that London is a highly civilised city. I do not need to remind
  you, I think, that a man who has even the outside breeding of a gentleman
  generally behaves with a young lady according to the encouragement he
  receives."</p>

  <p>Rosina laughed delightfully. There were times when she almost liked
  Madame.</p>

  <p>"Then Mr. Vaculos," she declared, "will behave extraordinarily well. Is
  that all you wished to say, Madame?"</p>

  <p>"That is all," Madame replied, "except that next time you see Lord
  Reginald, you might try and induce him to send his sisters here. Tell him
  that you get a commission on their custom. I will arrange something of the
  sort."</p>

  <p>"I will do my best, Madame," Rosina promised.</p>

  <p>She walked slowly back to the salesroom and sat down on a settee. There
  were still no customers present.</p>

  <p>"Come and sympathise with me, every one!" she exclaimed. "I am to dine
  with Mr. Vaculos to-night."</p>

  <p>"What are you to wear?" Mademoiselle Hortense demanded.</p>

  <p>"The white tulle model," Rosina told her.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to sympathise with you," Miss Violet Shaw declared. "I went
  to Ascot two days with him, and it was rather fun. I kept on missing him in
  the paddock, of course, and made him very angry, and he was furious with me
  at dinner because he thought that I was smiling at a man I knew at the next
  table. I expect that's why he dropped me."</p>

  <p>"I've been out with him," another girl remarked. "He's like all the rest
  but he isn't bad. He doesn't try to kiss you in the taxicab, anyhow."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe he cares for girls at all," Mademoiselle Hortense
  observed. "I think he simply likes a companion, and the best-dressed one he
  can find."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing mean about him, at any rate," Violet Shaw declared.
  "He'll send a car for you, and a bunch of orchids, and, if he takes you to a
  theatre, he generally has a box and plenty of chocolates."</p>

  <p>"<i>Attention!</i>" Mademoiselle Hortense interrupted, in her best French
  accent. "<i>Bonjour, Madame!</i>"</p>

  <p>The little company of girls melted away in the presence of clients. Rosina
  busied herself putting away some frocks. At the sound of a familiar voice,
  however, she turned her head. It was Matthew who stood there, looking about
  him with characteristic curiosity, Matthew sleek and prosperous, in the garb
  of the West End, the erstwhile Mrs. Ford, now his wife, by his side. Rosina
  was grateful for the restraint imposed upon her by the conventions of the
  establishment. Matthew had, without a doubt, recognised her, although he
  showed no signs of desiring to attract her notice. He took advantage, in
  fact, of his wife's distraction, a few moments later, to send a warning
  glance across the room, to which Rosina replied with an answering look of
  understanding from beneath her lowered eyelids. The situation appealed to her
  sense of humour. A few minutes later she was one of a little string of girls
  parading before this very desirable customer, who it appeared was in need of
  evening gowns. The lady was critical, Matthew had an eye for value. Rosina,
  who by chance was clad in the most daring of the creations, took care to look
  up for his approval each time with a bland and seraphic glance. Whilst they
  gossiped amongst themselves in the dressing room, the girls exchanged remarks
  as to these prospective customers.</p>

  <p>"She was the wife of a great city man," one girl told them,&mdash;"a
  Jewess, I believe."</p>

  <p>"She was married a few months ago to this man," another remarked. "He's in
  the city, too. Mrs. Matthew Garner her name is now. Her husband must be
  twenty years younger than she is."</p>

  <p>"Bet you she's got the money," Violet expounded. "You can always tell by
  the sheepish way a man looks at us whether he's afraid of his wife or
  not."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," Rosina announced, "he's terrified to death of me.
  We came from the same town in the north of England, and he used to take me
  out to dinner now and then, before he became a great man. Now he nearly fell
  over himself making signs to me&mdash;as though it were necessary!"</p>

  <p>"We girls do see life," Violet reflected, making a grimace at herself in
  the looking-glass. "This ought to fetch the old woman. If she thinks she's
  going to look anything like me in it, though, she'll be badly had. See me
  swim out, dears. I'm going to have just one tiny look at your man,
  Rosina&mdash;one quick, drooping glance, you know. You'll probably get a note
  in half an hour, asking you to take me to lunch to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"If he's anything by way of being a city prince," a tall, dark girl
  murmured, looking at herself in the mirror whilst she added some finishing
  touches to a wonderful creation in old gold, "I shall try my favourite side
  glance&mdash;if Madame is looking the other way. He evidently runs to large
  women&mdash;that is, if he married his wife for love."</p>

  <p>"He didn't," Rosina assured her. "He married her for half a million
  pounds. As a matter of fact, though, I don't think any of you have a chance.
  He was a little in love with me, but I didn't seem to fit in anywhere. Now
  that he's settled for life and sees me working here for my living, I quite
  expect that a wave of sentiment will sweep him off his feet&mdash;and he'll
  invite me to lunch."</p>

  <p>Madame's voice was heard outside, calling for a particular dress, and
  gossip was abandoned. In the end, Matthew's wife purchased three gowns and
  departed. Madame and Mademoiselle Hortense retired to the former's sanctum to
  discuss some alterations that were necessary. Rosina, who had special skill
  in that direction, was summoned to fold and put away some opera cloaks.
  Violet was leaning against the chest, talking to her, when Matthew
  returned.</p>

  <p>"Well, your old college chum has got a nerve!" she declared, under her
  breath. "Here he comes, as bold as brass!"</p>

  <p>Rosina turned around. Matthew advanced towards her, brisk and perfectly
  self-composed.</p>

  <p>"I forgot to mention," he said, "that we desire an account to be sent with
  the dresses, as my wife prefers to pay cash, with a suitable
  discount.&mdash;I am very glad to see you, Rosina. It seems a long time since
  we met."</p>

  <p>"I am very glad to see you, Matthew," she replied. "I saw you last on the
  day of your marriage."</p>

  <p>"What?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I read about it in the papers," she went on, "and I got to the church
  early and made friends with the verger. I was very careful," she assured him,
  with a faint smile. "I let him understand that I was a connection of a
  far-away dependent of your family, and he kindly put me in a pew with your
  wife's servants. I saw beautifully. A most interesting ceremony!"</p>

  <p>Matthew was only slightly discomposed.</p>

  <p>"I should have sent you an invitation if I had known where you were," he
  said. "You seemed to disappear altogether. Have you news of Philip?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;yes," she answered, looking over her shoulder. "You must not
  stay here, Matthew."</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"No followers allowed, eh?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't that," she told him drily. "We could do exactly as we liked, if
  Madame were only sure that it wouldn't interfere with business. She would say
  that your wife might come back."</p>

  <p>"And no fool, either!" he laughed. "Where do you live? Can I come and see
  you?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you want to very much, Matthew," she said, "but, even if
  you did, it would not be possible. I share a room with another girl, and our
  compact about 'followers' is a little stricter than the regulations
  here."</p>

  <p>"I'll write you a line, then," he promised. "Address it here, shall I?
  I've something to tell you about old Benjamin Stone that will make you
  laugh."</p>

  <p>"No bad news, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that depends," he answered. "He came to me, a month or two ago,
  begging for any sort of work. He's night watchman at the works
  now&mdash;three pounds a week, less insurance. What do you think of that,
  when you remember the old days?"</p>

  <p>"I think it is horrible!" Rosina declared indignantly.</p>

  <p>Madame came smiling from her counting room, and Matthew, unabashed, turned
  away to discuss the question of discount with her. Rosina made her escape.
  She shook her head at the little volley of chaff which greeted her from the
  inner room.</p>

  <p>"Lunch or dinner?" Violet enquired.</p>

  <p>Rosina made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"My dears," she replied, "he's a brute!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b-2"
     name="b-2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The day of Matthew's visit to Mathilde was also the day on
  which he reached the first great landmark in his upward progress. The deed of
  partnership had been signed that morning with much ceremony. He had the right
  to call himself a member of the firm of Faringdon, Nettleby, Ford and
  Company, merchant princes of the City of London, one of the names to which he
  had made his obeisance in that first pilgrimage of his to the city. It was
  all over, and yet, as a result of the morning's functions, he had shut
  himself in the very handsome private office now allotted for his sole use, a
  disappointed and angry man. He sat there, biting his finger nails, frowning
  and looking down upon the blotting paper. Who would have thought they could
  have been so obstinate&mdash;Faringdon, the sportsman; Nettleby, the
  gentlemanly ass, who frankly hated the city and everything to do with it! Yet
  there he was, tied up by their will, thwarted by an illogical but monumental
  obstinacy. He was one of the firm, a recognised and acknowledged partner; one
  of the firm whose balance of assets over liabilities, at that last
  stocktaking, stood at something like two and a half millions; whose current
  balance at the Bank of England was seldom less than a hundred thousand
  pounds. And yet he himself was to be deprived of the power which those great
  cheque books of the firm conferred on the man who might write in them. He
  could hear the echo of the little discussion, even now.</p>

  <p>"I shall, I presume, sign for the firm when necessary?" he had asked the
  lawyer, almost carelessly.</p>

  <p>The lawyer had looked at him over his spectacles in frank surprise, but he
  had found no time to reply. Mr. Faringdon had intervened with a directness
  and a dignity which he rarely made use of.</p>

  <p>"That is not our idea at all," he declared. "As a matter of fact, it will
  be quite unnecessary. Mr. Nettleby and I have for long had an arrangement not
  to be away from London at the same time. He and I alone will sign for the
  firm."</p>

  <p>"You see, my dear fellow," Mr. Nettleby had intervened, "you are not
  bringing any capital into the business. We've capitalised your brains, as it
  is, at something like a quarter of a million, when we allow you an eighth
  share. The actual capital belongs entirely to Faringdon and myself and your
  wife. There is no necessity for you to bother your head about the financial
  side of the business. Mr. Holmes, the cashier, was with the Bank of England
  for fifteen years before he came to us, and there's nothing to be saved in
  his department. He prepares the cheques for the various departments, and
  either Faringdon or I are always prepared to sign them."</p>

  <p>"I see," Matthew had said, trying to conceal his disappointment as much as
  possible. "I had an idea that all partners in a firm were entitled to sign
  cheques or accept bills."</p>

  <p>"As to bills," Mr. Faringdon intervened, "the question does not arise, as
  we have never accepted one during the whole history of the firm. As you know,
  both here in London and at our branches all over the world, we buy for cash
  and for cash only. We give credit but we never accept it. As regards the
  signing of cheques, Mr. Nettleby has already explained the situation. As a
  matter of fact, you will have quite enough to do without bothering your head
  about financial details."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure of that," Matthew replied. "It was only a matter of form. I had
  an idea that it was usual."</p>

  <p>"Not," the lawyer observed, "when the financial positions of the parties
  are so entirely different."</p>

  <p>"What about when my share of the profits drifts into the capital account?"
  Matthew asked. "Or if my wife should prefer her shares in the business being
  brought into my name?"</p>

  <p>"As regards the profits," Mr. Faringdon had answered, "we should beg you
  to pass them to your private account. The firm cannot use any more capital,
  and could not afford to pay you even a reasonable rate of interest. Of
  course, if Mrs. Garner had any idea of doing as you suggest, and the five or
  six hundred thousand pounds standing to her credit were placed in your name,
  the matter might have to be reconsidered."</p>

  <p>Whereupon, contrary to his custom, Matthew had gone home to lunch. Mrs.
  Garner was very pleased to see him, and an excellent meal was served. Matthew
  led her afterwards into the little room in their very handsome house, which
  had been furnished as a smoking room for him.</p>

  <p>"Adelaide," he announced, "there was just one small hitch in the
  proceedings this morning."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to hear that, dear," she said. "Tell me about it."</p>

  <p>"You see," he explained, "Faringdon and Nettleby both have very large sums
  of money standing to their credit in the business. I have nothing at all.
  Consequently, although I am a partner, they have decided between them that I
  am not to be allowed to draw cheques."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Garner had disposed of her voluminous figure, to her great content,
  in a large easy-chair, and puffed complacently at the cigarette which her
  dutiful husband had lit for her.</p>

  <p>"Well, dear, does that matter?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Not actually," he admitted, "but it matters very much indirectly. It is
  an undignified position for a man to be actually a partner in a great firm
  like ours, and yet not be allowed to sign on behalf of the firm. I think
  myself that their attitude is a little ungenerous."</p>

  <p>She deliberated upon the matter for a moment. In her younger days, the
  late Mr. Ford had considered her an excellent woman of business.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know," she said reflectively. "I suppose Mr. Faringdon and
  Mr. Nettleby have about a million each in the business, and you have nothing.
  Why should you be able to write a cheque for their million, or even a part of
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I have the brains," Matthew reminded her.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but they can't draw on your brains," she rejoined. "What you're
  worth is locked up there, with no one able to get at but yourself. Perhaps
  they want to keep what they've got locked up, too, in a different
  manner."</p>

  <p>Matthew frowned.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry you can't see my point of view," he said, a little irritably.
  "Anyhow, I can assure you that I don't like it. I like it so little that I
  came home on purpose to lay before you the one way in which the difficulty
  could be got over."</p>

  <p>"Before me?" she repeated, a little suspiciously. "Well, what is it,
  Matthew?"</p>

  <p>"Your share in the business&mdash;yours and the boy's," he reminded her,
  "is between five and six hundred thousand pounds. You are the boy's sole
  guardian, so practically it stands in your name alone. I was going to suggest
  that you transfer that amount&mdash;nominally, of course&mdash;to my name, so
  as to give me financial weight in the company."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Garner looked at her husband for several moments in silence. A very
  faint smile parted her somewhat over-full, slightly becarmined lips. If ever
  Matthew had had any suspicions as to his wife's Semitic origin, they became
  in that moment certainties.</p>

  <p>"My dear Matthew," she protested, "you are not serious!"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he demanded. "We are husband and wife. It's the same
  thing."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Garner leaned back in her chair and laughed, silently but happily.
  The laugh ended in a succession of chuckles. She sat up and dabbed her eyes
  with a heavily beperfumed handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"You are a very funny man, Matthew," she declared. "Personally, I think
  you are splendid. I am quite sure that you will make more money than Jeremiah
  ever did, but you will please leave mine just where it is."</p>

  <p>"I only wanted it to stand in my name," he muttered gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Fiddle-de-dee, my dear Matthew!" she exclaimed. "If it stands in your
  name, it's yours to use when you want to, and you know it. Now don't stand
  there glowering at me. You've done very well for yourself, and you're going
  to do better. I am paying ten thousand a year towards the upkeep of this
  house, and I've told you that, for the present, you needn't pay a penny. All
  that you have to look after are your own personal expenses and your clothes,
  and you're going to get an eighth share of the profits of one of the finest
  firms in the City of London. You be content with that. Remember you're only a
  boy yet. What are you&mdash;twenty-seven, or something of that sort? You'll
  be a rich man before you're thirty-five, and a millionaire by the time you're
  fifty. Don't rush things, Matthew."</p>

  <p>"I want to be a millionaire a long time before I'm fifty years old,"
  Matthew grumbled.</p>

  <p>"So you will be, if you keep your head," she assured him. "I'm glad you
  came home to lunch. I'm going to my dressmaker's this afternoon, and I want
  you to go with me."</p>

  <p>Matthew knew at least when to accept defeat, but after his visit to
  Mathilde's, he returned to the city and shut himself up in his new private
  office. The day, however, was shorn of some of its delights. No one knew
  better than he that he had no designs upon the capital of the firm. His
  cheque book would have been kept in perfect order, nor would he have written
  those few magic words&mdash;Faringdon, Nettleby, Ford and Company&mdash;upon
  any document of which Mr. Holmes would not have thoroughly approved. For an
  intensely practical person, however, the workings of Matthew's mind in this
  one respect were a little obscure. He was proud to walk through the streets
  of London, knowing himself to be a partner in a great firm, but there was
  something vital lacking from that position when he realised his limitations.
  He wanted to feel that, if he had chosen, he could have written a cheque for
  five figures or even six, which the Bank of England would have cashed without
  a moment's demur. In plain words, Matthew was unhappy because of an abstract
  feeling.</p>

  <p>As the evening approached, frequent demands were made upon his energies,
  but, during the last half hour of his business day, he was alone again. On
  this occasion, for a few minutes, he gave himself up to a far more congenial
  task. He sent for the private ledger. By the generosity of the firm, various
  sums were already standing to his credit. He struck a balance roughly and
  rang for a clerk.</p>

  <p>"Will you ask Mr. Holmes," he directed, "to transfer two thousand pounds
  to my private account, early to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>The clerk took his instructions and withdrew. What would he have said,
  Matthew wondered grimly, if he had known that that two thousand pounds
  practically represented every penny he, a partner in the great firm, owned!
  On his way home in his wife's car, which, having no use for it herself that
  evening, she had thoughtfully sent for him, he carefully studied the columns
  of a financial paper which he had bought at the first bookstall.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b-3"
     name="b-3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Rosina was spending a very pleasant, if slightly improper
  Sunday. She had motored to a quiet spot in the country with Reginald Towers,
  and they were now seated on the lawn of a secluded hotel, awaiting the
  preparation of luncheon. Her companion had something on his mind and chose
  this opportunity for getting rid of it.</p>

  <p>"I don't like that fellow Vaculos I saw you dining with the other night,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>"Neither do I," Rosina agreed.</p>

  <p>"Then why do you dine with him?"</p>

  <p>"He orders such good dinners," Rosina admitted.</p>

  <p>"You can always ring me up if you have nothing to do."</p>

  <p>She dropped him the semblance of a curtsey.</p>

  <p>"You are nearly always in Paris."</p>

  <p>"Why choose Vaculos?" he persisted. "There must be heaps of fellows glad
  to take you out to dine."</p>

  <p>She considered the matter for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Would you really like to know the truth?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I should," he assented.</p>

  <p>"Then apparently it is Mr. Vaculos's money which is at the back of
  Mathilde, Limited. Madame insists upon our all being polite to him."</p>

  <p>"What a filthy shame!" the young man exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"It is rather, isn't it?" Rosina agreed. "Sounds like 'Revelations from
  the West End!' in the Sunday papers. However, I am bound to say," she added
  thoughtfully, "that I never, in my life, dined with anybody who behaved
  better than Mr. Vaculos."</p>

  <p>"Give him time," her companion muttered.</p>

  <p>"I don't intend to," she answered. "I am going to tell him, next time he
  asks me, that I am engaged to a young man in America who objects to my dining
  out with wealthy, single men."</p>

  <p>"You won't evade Vaculos that way, if I know anything of the brute,"
  Reggie Towers declared. "By the by, have you heard from Duggie Erwen
  lately?"</p>

  <p>"Last week. He is the greatest dear in the world."</p>

  <p>The waiter summoned them to luncheon, but the conversation lingered around
  Douglas Erwen and his doings.</p>

  <p>"Kind of special pal of yours, wasn't he?" Rosina's escort asked
  cautiously.</p>

  <p>"He was nicer to me than any other man has ever been," she acknowledged,
  "and now he is being nice to the young man I am going to marry some day."</p>

  <p>"Unless I chip in," Reggie Towers observed.</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't be of the slightest use," she assured him sweetly. "I am much
  fonder of Philip than I could be of you."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why," he grumbled. "I've been well brought up and I have an
  affectionate disposition."</p>

  <p>"But I only want affection from one man, and you are not he," Rosina
  pointed out. "Besides, you move in far too exalted circles. You have a duke
  in the family, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"The governor. But I'm the fourth son."</p>

  <p>Rosina shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely hopeless," she declared. "My only known relative is a night
  watchman at three pounds a week. He was well off once and built a chapel, but
  he seems to have lost his money."</p>

  <p>"After all, what is birth?" he observed, sending away his plate for more
  roast beef.</p>

  <p>"Or money?" she sighed.</p>

  <p>"Or anything except love?" he added, watching the waiter carve.</p>

  <p>"Love," she repeated. "You don't know the meaning of the word."</p>

  <p>He looked at her with a hurt expression.</p>

  <p>"Don't goad me," he begged. "Remember you have to drive back in the car
  with me, and I really have an awfully queer feeling for you. If it isn't
  love, I don't know what it is."</p>

  <p>"I am ready to hear all about it," she told him composedly, "only, if it
  is a real proposal, may I have it in writing?"</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"I believe that Madame would give me a pound a week more, if she saw it.
  Madame isn't altogether pleased with me just now. I think Mr. Vaculos must
  have told her that I was dull. She calls me ineffective."</p>

  <p>"You're a queer girl," he said suddenly.</p>

  <p>"I'm having a beautiful luncheon," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful food you get sometimes at these out-of-the-way places," he
  observed. "Pity you don't drink beer."</p>

  <p>She watched his tankard being replenished.</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't go with my style," she assured him. "It looks awfully nice
  and cool, though. Do you mind my telling Madame that I lunched with you
  to-day?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit! You can tell her I asked you to marry me if you like."</p>

  <p>"I won't go so far as that," she promised, "only Madame thinks I'm such a
  prig, and I'm not really. I like fun as much as any girl in the world. I love
  being taken out. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah! that's just where it is," he interrupted ruefully. "Brought up in a
  religious family, weren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Nonconformist," she answered. "My uncle used to say prayers every day on
  a horsehair sofa. I don't think that's made any difference, though," she
  added reflectively. "I'm one of those quaint people who are born with
  principles. I couldn't even get rid of them in that atmosphere."</p>

  <p>They dawdled over luncheon and loitered about afterwards in the gardens
  and woods behind, to Rosina's intense delight. Their conversation ceased to
  exist as such. It became a spasmodic interchange of the light jargon of the
  day, a pursuit in which the young man excelled, and which Rosina felt in
  accord with her own light-heartedness. For, in her way, she was born to enjoy
  life. Every little expedition had its peculiar savour for her. Her face was
  turned so sedulously away from ugly things, her appreciation of the simplest
  kindness was so intense, that she had developed an effortless joy of living
  which sent her with light footsteps over many dreary places. She leaned back
  in the car, on their homeward way, with a little sigh of content. Then she
  suddenly patted her companion's long, brown fingers, at that moment engaged
  in arranging the rug about her.</p>

  <p>"If I really am to call you 'Reggie', here goes, then," she said. "I think
  you're perfectly sweet to me. I don't say much about it but I do appreciate
  it."</p>

  <p>"Who wouldn't be?" he observed, a little gloomily. "You're a very
  attractive girl&mdash;much too attractive."</p>

  <p>"A good many people wouldn't be, and you know why," she rejoined, as they
  spun along the road towards London. "From the point of view of most men, I am
  peculiar."</p>

  <p>"In what way?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"All the men I ever meet," she went on, "seem to be possessed of such
  affectionate dispositions. I don't know one besides your dear self&mdash;not
  amongst those I see nowadays, at any rate&mdash;who would trouble to take a
  girl out for the whole day who doesn't care about having her hand
  held&mdash;and all that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>"You're a ripping little pal," he declared.</p>

  <p>"I love to hear you say so," she admitted, "but, even with you, I feel
  somehow as though I were a cheat. I feel as though I were taking something
  for nothing. You give me a lovely motor ride, a delightful lunch and the best
  part of your day. I accept everything and I say 'thank you.' It seems
  inadequate."</p>

  <p>"It is always open to you to make amends," he reminded her.</p>

  <p>"But you know perfectly well that I can't," she insisted. "I'm not
  apologising, because you knew it quite well before you brought me out to-day,
  but I don't want to seem to take everything too much for granted. I do
  appreciate your sweetness and I love you for it."</p>

  <p>"I hope that other fellow will deserve what he'll get," the young man
  sighed.</p>

  <p>"I think he will," Rosina replied, "but that, of course, is rather a dream
  of mine."</p>

  <p>"What about next Sunday?" he asked, as they drew near London.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You're a dear to ask me," she answered, "but no! You must entertain one
  of these little ladies who takes life less seriously than I do."</p>

  <p>He was silent for a few moments.</p>

  <p>"Funny part of it is, I'm not sure that I want to," he observed. "You're
  rather like a tonic to a fellow, you know. One comes home from a day with
  you, feeling kind of all in the clouds and no end bucked up. It's unnatural,
  but I rather like it."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't for long," she sighed.</p>

  <p>"Let's dine somewhere to-night," he suggested. "I'll show you I can see
  the day through, anyway."</p>

  <p>She laughed heartily, then became suddenly grave.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what I am doing to-night?" she asked. "I am going to a party
  at Mr. Vaculos's house."</p>

  <p>"What, that swine? Good God!"</p>

  <p>"Please don't make me more unhappy about it than I am," Rosina begged.
  "Besides, it's better than having to dine with him alone. There is a crowd of
  people going."</p>

  <p>"Are you going by yourself?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I hate that," she admitted, "but Violet Shaw is going with one of
  her numerous young men, and I don't think any of the other girls are
  invited."</p>

  <p>"You needn't go alone unless you like," he declared. "I'll take you."</p>

  <p>"You?" she exclaimed. "But you don't know Mr. Vaculos&mdash;you haven't
  been invited."</p>

  <p>"Just where you're wrong, my child," he chuckled. "I don't know where I
  met the fellow&mdash;at a race meeting, I expect. I remember some one asked
  me to be civil to him&mdash;some one he'd lent a monkey to, I think it was.
  He's asked me to his house no end of times, but I've never dreamed of going.
  He sent me a card for to-night&mdash;ten-thirty till four. Supper two
  o'clock. That's the show, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"That's it," Rosina acknowledged.</p>

  <p>"We'll have a little dinner first and go on together," he proposed. "Much
  better for you than going in alone. The old boy will be glad to see me, too.
  Might help you with the firm, what?"</p>

  <p>"You dear!" Rosina exclaimed. "Why, I'd love to go with you! Madame will
  be delighted. And I am frightened of Madame," she confided. "I had rather a
  struggle before I found this place, and if ever I do have a nightmare, it's
  the fear of losing it."</p>

  <p>"You won't lose it," he assured her. "I've three giddy sisters, all with
  plenty of oof. I'll send them all to Mathilde&mdash;give them a frock each to
  start with, if I can't get them there any other way. This is your number,
  isn't it? I'll bring the old bus round at eight o'clock. Sha'n't come up.
  You'll be able to see me out of the window."</p>

  <p>"I won't keep you waiting a minute," she promised. "And, Reggie, I've got
  a lovely frock, and such a coat! They aren't mine, of course, and I'm almost
  terrified to wear them, but as long as I'm going with you, I'm glad. You
  can't think what a difference it makes."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," he replied, a little gruffly. "Eight o'clock. I'll
  have a corner table at Claridge's."</p>

  <p>Rosina found her fellow lodger lying on a couch, reading a novel. The air
  was heavy with cigarette smoke. Rosina threw open a window impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Idiot!" she exclaimed. "You told me you particularly wanted to look your
  best to-night, and here you lie in this close room, smoking, instead of
  getting some exercise."</p>

  <p>Violet laid down her book.</p>

  <p>"My dear," she said, "my complexion does not depend upon such trifles.
  Besides, no gilded youth has clamoured for my society in his Rolls-Royce this
  afternoon. You do look well, Rosina," she added, a little enviously.</p>

  <p>"I've had a lovely day," Rosina declared, "sunshine, and the country, and
  a walk in the woods which I loved, and lots of fresh air. What have you been
  doing?"</p>

  <p>"I lunched with Victor at his rooms," Violet replied. "He is coming here
  for me, to look at my gown."</p>

  <p>"To look at your gown?" Rosina repeated.</p>

  <p>Violet nodded.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe I told you about Victor, dear, did I?" she asked. "He's
  Celeste's principal dress designer. He designs most of the models that we get
  in Paris. The gown I am going to wear to-night is one of his creations, and
  he wouldn't let me go out in it if there was a single thing which didn't
  please him. I'm afraid you'll be shocked, dear, but I know he'll insist upon
  putting it on for me. That part of it is purely a matter of business with
  him."</p>

  <p>Rosina's first look of horror faded away almost at once.</p>

  <p>"What a world!" she exclaimed. "A man dressmaker arranging the artistic
  creation of his brain on the body of his beloved!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not his beloved&mdash;or rather, not his only one," Violet grumbled.
  "I wish I were.&mdash;And, Rosina?"</p>

  <p>"My dear!"</p>

  <p>"I did just hint to him that it was rather horrid thinking of your going
  alone to the party to-night, but he's the quaintest person. He has such funny
  prejudices. He hates being seen out with two women."</p>

  <p>"You were a dear to think about it," Rosina declared. "As it happens, I
  have an escort. The young man who took me out motoring is going. Isn't it
  luck!"</p>

  <p>"What, Lord Reginald Towers?"</p>

  <p>Rosina assented.</p>

  <p>"Not so much of it, please," she begged. "I call him Reggie now. He's such
  a dear thing, Violet."</p>

  <p>"Tell me, young woman," Violet insisted, "did you know him before the day
  he came in with his married sister and nearly fell in a heap on the floor
  when he saw you?"</p>

  <p>"I did," Rosina assured her. "I was introduced to him by the dearest
  friend I ever had in my life&mdash;Douglas Erwen. I was on the stage for a
  week or two, you know, at the Garrick. Nothing to say and nothing to do. They
  cut us out after a time."</p>

  <p>"It is my belief," Violet said deliberately, "that you are a sly little
  cat."</p>

  <p>Rosina dragged her friend up from the sofa.</p>

  <p>"Go and have your bath," she ordered, "and I shall have time to do your
  hair for you before I have mine. Mind, I won't touch it if you smoke another
  cigarette before you leave here."</p>

  <p>"Bully!" Violet exclaimed, as she made her way across the room. "Don't
  forget that Victor likes those little curls at the side."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b-4"
     name="b-4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. Vaculos was a merchant prince with taste, which merchant
  princes seldom have, and an immense reserve, which is also a rare attribute
  of the species. He was a man of middle height, slightly portly, with fair
  hair, thin almost to baldness at the top and inclined to curliness at the
  sides. His complexion was pale, his features undistinguished but tolerable,
  his eyes a light and unpleasant shade of brown. He was always dressed with
  the greatest care; he was deliberate in his speech and correct in his
  manners. To take him as he stood, there seemed to be nothing that any one
  could find fault with. Yet the slowness of him, his lack of colour, and the
  repulsion of his eyes, dominant features of his personality, probably
  accounted for the somewhat unpleasant nickname&mdash;"the white
  snail"&mdash;by which he was known throughout bohemian London.</p>

  <p>He received his guests, on the night of the party, in a very handsome,
  circular apartment, supported by stone pillars, and furnished in Oriental
  fashion with divans and a few priceless rugs. Through the spaces between the
  pillars, however, were visions, on one side, of a delightful ballroom, from
  which strains of wonderful dance music, melodious but of the modern type,
  floated out; on the other, of a supper room and a quaint little bar, aglow
  with flowers and shaded lights. Rosina, on the whole, was somewhat relieved
  at her reception. They had trooped up the stairs in somewhat irregular
  fashion, and Mr. Vaculos had welcomed her escort with a cordiality which was
  almost fulsome. As soon as he realised the situation, however, a slight but
  unpleasant smile disturbed the serenity of his expression. He held Rosina's
  hand a little longer than she thought necessary, and, with a glance at
  Reggie, he whispered an injunction in her ear.</p>

  <p>"Do not have supper until I am able to join you. I have arranged a
  table."</p>

  <p>Rosina nodded assent, but she shivered a little as she entered the
  ballroom.</p>

  <p>"Cold?" Reggie asked, as he held out his hands.</p>

  <p>She shook her head, already moving away to the music.</p>

  <p>"That man," she murmured,&mdash;"he seems slimy. Let us forget him."</p>

  <p>The evening was halfway through before Rosina saw Madame. She was alone
  for a moment, having insisted upon her escort's dancing with one of his
  theatrical acquaintances. Madame called to her across the room, and looked at
  her with an enigmatic smile through peering dark eyes.</p>

  <p>"So you found an escort?" she remarked.</p>

  <p>Rosina nodded.</p>

  <p>"It was all right to bring him, wasn't it?" she asked. "He had an
  invitation. Somehow, I fancied that Mr. Vaculos did not seem altogether
  pleased."</p>

  <p>Madame smiled.</p>

  <p>"I think," she said, "that Mr. Vaculos is quite glad to have Lord Reginald
  amongst his guests. At the same time, I dare say he was not so pleased to
  have him here as your escort. Mr. Vaculos admires you very much, Miss
  Vonet."</p>

  <p>"Then I wish he wouldn't," Rosina declared frankly.</p>

  <p>Madame remained imperturbable but critical. As a matter of fact, she was
  not at all sure that she understood Rosina.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Vaculos is a very wealthy man," she remarked, "and a very generous
  one."</p>

  <p>Rosina smiled.</p>

  <p>"The most important thing of all, Madame, is that he is your friend," she
  said. "That is why I wish to be pleasant to him."</p>

  <p>"How old are you, child?" Madame asked.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-one," Rosina replied.</p>

  <p>"And you have been in London how long?"</p>

  <p>"A little more than two years."</p>

  <p>"And you have no relatives, I understand, or connections of any sort?"</p>

  <p>Rosina shook her head. It seemed a strange place to be reminded of her
  loneliness.</p>

  <p>"I have an uncle," she said, "but he is quite poor."</p>

  <p>"Is my memory at fault," Madame persisted, "or did you not speak of having
  had a very hard time, when I engaged you?"</p>

  <p>"I had a terrible struggle for many months," Rosina acknowledged. "I tried
  so many things without success. I began to think I should never get another
  situation."</p>

  <p>"You seem to have common sense," Madame observed. "Doesn't it occur to you
  that it is a wise thing for a girl to have one or two friends&mdash;one,
  even&mdash;who is wealthy? Take Mr. Vaculos, for instance. Any one in whom he
  took a real interest would never have any anxieties again."</p>

  <p>The music seemed suddenly full of discords, the atmosphere heavy, the
  murmur of voices and laughter strained and unnatural. Rosina felt herself
  growing cold. Then she found her courage. She struck her little heel upon the
  floor.</p>

  <p>"Friends like Mr. Vaculos would be of no service to me, Madame," she
  declared, "because I would rather starve than accept anything given me in
  that way."</p>

  <p>"Yet," Madame continued, still critical, still unperturbed, "you are fond
  of pretty clothes and dancing, the theatres, all the things that make for the
  gaiety of life."</p>

  <p>"I adore them," Rosina confessed. "Madame will excuse me."</p>

  <p>Reggie, who had finished his dance and was waiting patiently, close at
  hand, carried her off. Madame beckoned to Vaculos, who came and sat by her
  side.</p>

  <p>"You will have trouble with that girl," she warned him.</p>

  <p>"I like trouble," he answered.</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders. Rosina was dancing, but she had not regained
  her colour. Presently, she and her partner disappeared into the refreshment
  room.</p>

  <p>"Miss Vonet is not like any of my other girls," Madame continued
  thoughtfully. "She is not like any girl I have had anything to do with in my
  life."</p>

  <p>"She is nevertheless attractive," Vaculos remarked.</p>

  <p>"You men are babies," Madame declared. "You yourself are spoilt.
  Everything is attainable to you, so you value nothing. When something comes
  which is difficult, there is a new feeling stirred. Theoretically, we find
  puritanism absurd. Actually, we discover that it has subtle attractions."</p>

  <p>Vaculos rose to his feet. He very seldom committed himself to an opinion
  about anything.</p>

  <p>"I shall now collect our party for supper," he said.</p>

  <p>Rosina, to her annoyance, found herself on the left of her host. She had
  clung to her late partner, however, with such determination that there was
  little left for Mr. Vaculos to do but to offer him the place on her other
  side. A well-known actress sat opposite. Madame was a little lower down the
  table. The party was well selected, and Vaculos, although a silent host,
  showed the necessary amount of genius in directing the conversation. With a
  tact for which she felt really grateful, he avoided paying Rosina any marked
  attentions. Soon her first uncomfortable feeling wore off. She began to
  appreciate and enjoy her surroundings. She joined heartily in the laughter
  which followed the recital by a French com&eacute;dienne of some of her droll
  adventures on this, her first visit to England. A distinguished English actor
  capped them with some reminiscences of his own when he had first played
  Shakespeare in Paris. He appealed, now and then, to his host.</p>

  <p>"You ought to remember those days, Vaculos," he said. "You owned half a
  dozen theatres in Paris then, in the days when they were worth owning."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Vaculos was once very unkind to me," the French com&eacute;dienne
  complained, with a little grimace at him. "He refused me a theatre for one of
  my plays. Until to-night, I have never quite forgiven him."</p>

  <p>Vaculos raised his glass.</p>

  <p>"Let our reconciliation be complete, Madame," he begged.</p>

  <p>Rosina found it all very delightful. She tried even to think more kindly
  of her host. Afterwards, yielding to the request of one of the party, a
  little group of them wandered over the house, passed up the wonderful marble
  staircase, and through suites of marvellously furnished rooms. Vaculos showed
  them, even, his own apartments&mdash;his bedroom, furnished with splendid but
  almost barbaric simplicity, his bathroom and sanctum beyond, the walls of the
  latter lined to the ceiling with bookcases full of rare books and folios.</p>

  <p>"And there?" Madame asked, pointing to a door on the other side.</p>

  <p>Vaculos took a key from his chain and unlocked it. They passed into an
  exquisite little sitting room and bedroom of the Louis Seize period, all rose
  colour and gilt, the panelled walls hung with one or two marvellous etchings,
  the writing table a treasure from Versailles, priceless and unique. The
  bathroom was fashioned of black and white marble, the bath itself sunk from
  the level of the floor and extending the whole length of the apartment.</p>

  <p>"Rather an anachronism," Vaculos murmured deprecatingly, "but the
  plumber's art was scarcely understood in the reign of Louis Seize."</p>

  <p>"My dear man, it is marvellous!" Madame declared.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me," the French actress demanded,&mdash;"I am a person without
  tact, perhaps, but I will know&mdash;who occupies these marvellous
  apartments? What princess do you keep locked up here, Monsieur Vaculos?"</p>

  <p>He slipped the key into his pocket and led the way downstairs.</p>

  <p>"As yet," he answered quietly, "they are unoccupied. The princess who may
  some day take possession of them has not yet been gracious."</p>

  <p>Rosina suddenly gripped at Reggie's arm. She was some distance
  away&mdash;she had kept her eyes turned sedulously from him&mdash;yet she
  knew very well that the quiet gaze of the speaker had rested for a moment
  upon her.&mdash;The English actor turned back to his host.</p>

  <p>"With treasures like yours, my dear Vaculos," he said, "and such a house,
  there is a bounden duty before you. You ought to marry."</p>

  <p>"The idea has sometimes occurred to me," Vaculos acknowledged.</p>

  <p>"I am a fool, a fool, a fool!" Rosina exclaimed, as her feet flashed once
  more on the shining floor and she gave herself up to the rhythm of the music.
  "Mr. Vaculos has got on my nerves. No doubt he thinks he did me a great
  honour by taking me out to dinner, and I don't suppose he has even thought of
  me since, and yet, directly he comes near, I feel as though there were
  something unpleasant around. I hate the very quietness of him. If he would
  once raise his voice or look angry, it would be a relief. Was it my
  fancy&mdash;tell me, Reggie?&mdash;or did he look at me
  upstairs&mdash;horridly?"</p>

  <p>Reggie grinned.</p>

  <p>"He's got his eye on you, all right," he declared. "All that show
  upstairs&mdash;gilded bird cage, what?"</p>

  <p>She almost swung herself out of his arms.</p>

  <p>"That men should dare to think of such things!" she cried
  passionately.</p>

  <p>"They always have done and always will," her partner replied equably,
  "especially pigs like Vaculos. It really doesn't matter much, in these days.
  Abductions are out of date. Self-determination is the modern motto. Nothing
  for you to look scared about."</p>

  <p>"I suppose there isn't, really," she answered, half-heartedly.</p>

  <p>The music stopped for a moment and they sat in a quiet corner.</p>

  <p>"Be a sensible girl and a pal," he enjoined. "Tell me just what you are
  afraid of?"</p>

  <p>"Frankly, then, I will," she replied. "As I told you, Madame is connected
  with Mr. Vaculos in business. She is under obligations to him. I am afraid of
  being turned away."</p>

  <p>"You little idiot!" he scoffed. "Madame isn't such a fool. There isn't
  another girl with your figure, and as graceful as you to show off her beastly
  frocks, in all London."</p>

  <p>"My dear," she assured him, patting his arm, "there are five hundred. They
  come in, looking for a place, every day. I've seen one or two of them with
  the same look in their eyes that I had&mdash;and sometimes I am afraid."</p>

  <p>"Am I not your friend?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course you are," she answered, gratefully but a little sadly. "You're
  a dear, sweet friend and I'm grateful to you. But if Madame sent me away, you
  couldn't show me where to go and earn four pounds a week."</p>

  <p>Vaculos crossed the floor. For the first time during the evening, he
  deliberately approached Rosina.</p>

  <p>"Will you give me this dance, Miss Vonet?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She rose at once.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she assented. "How nice of you to ask me when there are so
  many here!"</p>

  <p>"It is a host's privilege, after supper," he remarked, "to choose
  according to his inclinations."</p>

  <p>They moved away almost in silence. Vaculos danced correctly and with no
  sign of effort. He made only one casual remark, and directly the music
  stopped he took her back to where Reggie stood awaiting them.</p>

  <p>"I am very much obliged, Miss Vonet," he said, with a formal bow. "You
  dance beautifully."</p>

  <p>He moved away. Rosina looked after him, a little puzzled. Then she laughed
  at her companion.</p>

  <p>"I am beginning to believe," she told him, "that I am a conceited
  ass!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b-5"
     name="b-5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Matthew sat side by side with Rosina in a sheltered corner
  of Kensington Gardens. The locality was none of his choosing, but Rosina
  would have nothing to do with the out-of-the-way little Italian restaurant he
  had suggested. She was looking more attractive than ever, but Matthew was
  rather full of his own affairs. It was odd that in his new life there seemed
  to be no one at all in whom he could confide.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm a partner," he reiterated, "a partner in one of the greatest of
  those firms whose names I pointed out to you on our first day in London.
  That's what I call success&mdash;solid, substantial success. But I've done
  even better than that."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by 'better than that'?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He fanned himself gently with his silk hat. The day was warm; in the city,
  the heat had been almost intolerable.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you, Rosina," he said. "You were always intelligent, although
  you have made life difficult for yourself by all manner of silly notions.
  They made me a junior partner, but my financial inferiority made the position
  a little difficult. It was open to me to earn anything up to twenty thousand
  a year&mdash;even at the present moment I am earning it&mdash;but, in the
  private ledger of the firm, my two partners stood for about a million apiece
  and I for nothing. They rubbed it in, too. They wouldn't let me sign for the
  firm."</p>

  <p>She sympathised vaguely. Matthew had been longing to tell this to some one
  for so long that he had forgotten her very presence and existence. She was
  just a listening machine. He was getting something off his chest.</p>

  <p>"It was pretty clear to me then what I had to do. I had to make money.
  Well, that's in my line. I've got the touch of money-making, somehow. Money
  comes to me, when I whistle, like a spaniel to its master. I got together a
  matter of two thousand pounds, I consulted some shrewd stockbrokers, and I
  began what some people would call a course of speculation. It isn't
  speculation with me. I know what I'm doing. I see the thing through to the
  end before I begin. I started with that two thousand pounds. Sometimes I take
  my stockbroker's advice and sometimes I don't. On to-day's market prices, I
  am worth a hundred thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"Marvellous!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"It is marvellous," he admitted. "I don't think there is any other man who
  could have done it. Sometimes I bought or sold, dead against my stockbroker's
  advice. I was always right. I shall go on quietly as I am doing. I shall not
  try to make a million, but, when I have reached something like half that
  amount, I shall pass it to my credit in the books of the firm. I shall point
  out what my holding is. I shall claim an equal right with those other two
  selfish wastrels to sign for the firm."</p>

  <p>"Does it mean as much as all that to you?" she asked, curiously.</p>

  <p>"It means all that," he acknowledged. "It means power&mdash;the sense of
  power, Rosina. It means that I can walk down Lombard Street and chuckle to
  myself. I jostle against the rich men of the world. I hold my own with them
  on equal terms. I, Matthew Garner, with my own fingers, can write a cheque
  which will make them lift their hats with respect. I'm older now, Rosina,
  than when I talked common sense to you and Philip and you spouted back false
  philosophy and sentiment to me. I was right. I cling to my tenets to-day more
  than ever. Money is the greatest power in the world."</p>

  <p>"I still don't agree with you, Matthew," she protested.</p>

  <p>He laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;a mannequin at four pounds a week&mdash;liable to a week's
  notice and dire poverty at any moment! And Philip&mdash;a drunken failure
  here, helped out to America by charity, making a struggling living there in
  cheap journalism."</p>

  <p>"He has nothing to do with cheap journalism," Rosina interrupted sharply.
  "He has had one or two stories published in the best magazines of America,
  and he has great hopes of his novel. Mr. Erwen wrote me himself that he
  considered Philip had a brilliant future."</p>

  <p>"Pooh! What does it all amount to?" Matthew demanded. "Could he pay his
  passage home if he wanted to? Could he live in a house in Belgrave Square, as
  I do, keep twelve servants, ride in his own motor car, lunch and dine where
  he chooses, have a balance in the bank sufficient to live on for the rest of
  his days? Not he! However you look at it, Rosina, I am the only successful
  one of the three. You were a fool not to cast in your lot with mine. Even now
  I am willing to help you."</p>

  <p>"Are you?" she asked, a little drily. "How can you help me? You wouldn't
  even give me a meal in a restaurant in the West End, for fear of being seen.
  I don't know why, I'm sure. I'm quite respectable, Matthew."</p>

  <p>"I haven't a doubt of it," he growled. "All the same, one has to remember
  the look of things. A business man, a man of weight in the city, must never
  be talked about; apart from which, Rosina, my wife, who has five hundred
  thousand pounds in Faringdon, Nettleby, Ford and Company&mdash;five hundred
  thousand pounds, mind&mdash;is a very jealous woman."</p>

  <p>"Then you are probably in for a little trouble," Rosina remarked, with a
  gleam of mischief in her eyes, "for here she is!"</p>

  <p>It was Mrs. Matthew Garner, indeed, who had suddenly turned a corner and
  appeared before them. She carried a Pomeranian under one arm, and was
  followed by two others. She was taking that daily need of exercise which the
  doctor had recommended to her as a last safeguard against her growing
  obesity, and which her veterinary surgeon had insisted upon for the sake of
  her canine treasures. Without a moment's warning, she found herself face to
  face with her husband and an extraordinarily beautiful young woman.</p>

  <p>"May I ask what you are doing here, Matthew?" she demanded, as soon as she
  had recovered from her astonishment.</p>

  <p>He rose at once to his feet.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he explained, "I was walking home from Hyde Park Corner when I
  met this young lady, a friend of my Norchester days&mdash;Miss Rosina Vonet,
  of whom you have heard me speak."</p>

  <p>"It is unfortunate," Mrs. Garner said coldly, "that I should recognise the
  young person as being one of the mannequins at Mathilde's. You had every
  opportunity of renewing your acquaintance with her on the occasion of our
  visit there, but I did not notice any attempt on your part to do so. Be so
  good as to accompany me home."</p>

  <p>She sailed on. Matthew's farewell to Rosina consisted of a grimace. Rosina
  sat on the seat and watched them disappear. She felt that she ought to have
  seen the humour of the situation and laughed. She somehow failed to, however.
  Her eyes were still dim when she got up to make her way homeward.</p>

  <p>Madame sent for her, the next morning, to come to her sanctum, a summons
  which Rosina never obeyed without a sinking of the heart. Madame was clearly
  annoyed, yet in a way puzzled. She bade Rosina close the door and looked at
  her again with that searching expression which never failed to make her
  uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"Miss Vonet," she said, "I am afraid that you and I do not understand one
  another."</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry to hear that, Madame," Rosina replied.</p>

  <p>"You affect a regularity of conduct," Madame continued, "which, in a young
  person of your years, and with your appearance, is somewhat unusual. You
  affect resentment at attentions which I must frankly own that I, at your age,
  should have welcomed with pride. Yet I receive this morning a letter of
  complaint from a valued lady customer, concerning your conduct with her
  husband. It seems that she brought him in here with her, a short time ago,
  and yesterday she found you sitting with him in Kensington Gardens. It is not
  your business, Miss Vonet, to sit in public places with the husbands of my
  clients."</p>

  <p>"Your letter, of course, was from Mrs. Garner," Rosina said. "Her husband
  and I were brought up together in Norchester. My uncle was his guardian."</p>

  <p>"If that be true," Madame asked, "how is it that, when he arrived here
  with his wife, you showed no sign of recognition and treated him as a perfect
  stranger?"</p>

  <p>"I was a fool," Rosina admitted bitterly. "He gave me to understand that
  he wished not to be recognised, and, to save trouble, I fell in with his
  hint."</p>

  <p>"A little unfortunate, perhaps," Madame remarked. "It makes such an
  explanation as you now offer sound a little ridiculous. But, to speak
  frankly, Miss Vonet, why in the name of common sense sit in Kensington
  Gardens? Why not meet the man at a restaurant, or tea rooms, or have him come
  to your apartments? Why advertise yourself in this flagrant fashion?"</p>

  <p>"He asked me to meet him at a restaurant in Soho, which I have heard is
  not a nice place," Rosina explained. "I refused to go, and simply told him
  that I walked in the Park or Kensington Gardens every evening after
  work."</p>

  <p>Madame abandoned her study of the delinquent. She had apparently made up
  her mind.</p>

  <p>"Miss Vonet," she pronounced, "I am afraid that you are a fool, and there
  is no place for fools in my establishment. You will please
  understand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Madame broke off in the middle of her sentence. Noiselessly as ever,
  unwholesomely white, sleek and immaculately dressed, Mr. Vaculos had entered
  the room. He looked from one to the other.</p>

  <p>"I trust that I do not intrude, Madame," he said. "I have come to speak to
  you on the matter of that over-draft."</p>

  <p>"You can go, Miss Vonet," Madame directed.</p>

  <p>Vaculos stood before the door. His cold eyes seemed to be reading Rosina's
  face.</p>

  <p>"There is something wrong here," he suggested,&mdash;"some little matter,
  perhaps, in which I can help?"</p>

  <p>"I have just told Miss Vonet that she is a fool," Madame declared angrily.
  "I have also told her that I have no use for fools here."</p>

  <p>Vaculos was unmoved and unsurprised. In the face of his immobility, Rosina
  herself remained silent.</p>

  <p>"What is Miss Vonet's offence?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"Sitting in the Park with the husband of one of my best clients," Madame
  replied, "a jealous woman, who pays for her gowns the day she gets them."</p>

  <p>"Indiscreet but perhaps pardonable," Vaculos observed, with the slightest
  of frowns. "May I ask the man's name?"</p>

  <p>"His name is Matthew Garner," Rosina intervened. "I have just explained to
  Madame that I was brought up with him. My uncle was his guardian."</p>

  <p>"Under those circumstances," Vaculos said meaningly, "Miss Vonet's
  indiscretion does not seem serious enough to warrant dismissal."</p>

  <p>Madame's eyes flashed fire for a moment. The pencil which she was holding
  snapped in two.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she decided, "your notice is withdrawn, Miss Vonet. You have
  Mr. Vaculos to thank for it. In future, for heaven's sake, behave like an
  ordinary human being. Meet the man every day of your life, if you want
  to&mdash;I don't care&mdash;but don't run up against his wife. I shall have
  to say I have dismissed you, so keep out of the way when she comes here
  again."</p>

  <p>Rosina turned towards the door. She was feeling a little dazed. She
  murmured a word of incoherent thanks. Vaculos quite unostentatiously opened
  the door for her and she passed out.</p>

  <p>"A most opportune arrival, yours," Madame sneered.</p>

  <p>"I agree," Vaculos murmured. "I am glad that I was in time to stop your
  dismissing the young woman. I have come to talk to you about Paris."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b-6"
     name="b-6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">After her turbulent few minutes with Madame, things improved
  with Rosina. Reggie Towers' three sisters obeyed their brother's behest,
  ordered gowns from Mathilde and became regular customers. Vaculos went to
  South America on a business trip and seemed in no great hurry to return.
  There was no further question of dismissal. Rosina seemed, indeed, to be in
  favour with Madame, who even went so far as to promise her a bonus at
  Christmas on the accounts of the ladies Towers. The news from Philip
  continued to be satisfactory. By next autumn he hoped to be able to return to
  London. Of Matthew she heard nothing&mdash;not even a line since his somewhat
  ignominious retreat with his wife in Kensington Gardens. But, wandering down
  Regent Street one evening after work, she came face to face with Benjamin
  Stone.</p>

  <p>"Uncle!" she cried, stopping and holding out her hand.</p>

  <p>For a moment he seemed as though he scarcely recognised her. Then, to her
  surprise, a look of pleasure lightened his sad face. He was, without a doubt,
  glad to see her.</p>

  <p>"Rosina!" he exclaimed. "Why, you're looking well."</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't I be well?" she laughed. "I've had a good situation for
  quite a long time now, and I really think I look like keeping it. My
  principal has just told me that she is very pleased with me, and I am going
  to get four pounds ten a week from next Saturday."</p>

  <p>"It is good money," Benjamin Stone admitted,&mdash;"more than I am getting
  myself. What might the work be?"</p>

  <p>"I'm in a dressmaker's establishment," Rosina explained. "I'm a sort of
  peg on which they hang the dresses. If they look nice on me, people often buy
  them. Sometimes, when they get them home, they're disappointed, but that
  isn't my fault, is it?&mdash;Uncle, I haven't told you," she went on, "how
  sorry I was to hear about your losses. I am sorry, really. Come and have some
  tea with me, and tell me all about it."</p>

  <p>They wandered into a tea shop and found comfortable seats. Benjamin Stone
  was marvellously little changed. His face was perhaps a little sterner and
  whiter, and there may have been a few more grey hairs. His clothes, though
  well-kept, were shabby. He carried himself, however, with the same simple
  dignity, as upright as a dart, and his eyes were bright and keen.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to have an opportunity of a few words with you, Rosina," he
  began. "There is something which I have desired to say for some time. I had a
  letter from Philip, the day he embarked for the States. I gather that we were
  in the wrong when we paid that visit to you at the Savoy."</p>

  <p>Rosina laid her hand upon his.</p>

  <p>"I was in the wrong, too," she acknowledged, "not, perhaps, so far as
  Philip was concerned, but I ought at any rate to have told you the
  truth."</p>

  <p>"Philip wrote like one sorely ashamed of himself," Benjamin Stone
  continued. "I gather that it is one of your friends, too&mdash;the man who
  found you shelter&mdash;who is looking after Philip and giving him a fresh
  start."</p>

  <p>"Douglas Erwen," she assented. "He's been such a dear to me, uncle."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"It's a hard world, this, for one like myself to understand," he admitted.
  "He is a young man, this Mr. Douglas Erwen, and he has befriended you. Was
  there no question of marriage, then, between you two?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Erwen did ask me to marry him," she confided.</p>

  <p>"Then why didn't you get out of all your troubles and accept his offer?"
  her uncle demanded. "He seems to be a man of upright character, and he has
  been a good friend to you."</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am going to marry Philip some day," she told him.</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone frowned solemnly. For some reason or other, the news seemed
  to distress him.</p>

  <p>"Philip will never be worthy of you," he declared.</p>

  <p>"You don't know Philip," she assured him. "I admit that he made a bad
  start in London, but everything went against him and he fell into bad hands.
  It would never have happened if our savings had held out a short time longer,
  or if Matthew had not been so exacting."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone winced.</p>

  <p>"I watched the lad grow up," he persisted. "He has no ballast and he never
  had. He's no fit husband for you, Rosina."</p>

  <p>"You mustn't say that, please," she protested, "because I love him and am
  going to marry him."</p>

  <p>"You'll marry a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped short in his angry speech. She waited in vain for him to
  finish.</p>

  <p>"Go on," she begged.</p>

  <p>"No, I'll not say that word," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"You've something against Philip, though?"</p>

  <p>"I have."</p>

  <p>"Then tell it me? I have a right to know."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell it you when Philip returns," he promised. "I'd like to think
  well of the lad, if I could, for his father's sake, Rosina, but there's
  something stands between us. We'll let it be till he's here himself."</p>

  <p>"You're a hard judge, uncle," she sighed.</p>

  <p>"Maybe," he admitted.... "I've a quarter of an hour more, Rosina, before I
  go on my way. There's something I'd like to ask you."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Anything you wish, but first tell me, is it really true, uncle, that you
  are night watchman at Matthew's warehouse?"</p>

  <p>"It is quite true," he replied. "They give me three pounds a week and I am
  thankful for the job."</p>

  <p>"But surely Matthew could have found you something better than that!"</p>

  <p>"I am content," he said. "Rosina, this is what I have had in my mind to
  say to you. I live in a small way now, but I could afford, with everything
  put together, to keep at any rate a roof over your head. Will you give up
  this dressmaking work and come back to my care? I'll do the best I can for
  you. I can promise no more."</p>

  <p>Rosina hesitated for several moments. It was not that she was in any doubt
  as to her reply, but she was conscious of a very real desire to avoid any
  risk of giving him pain. She had realised that he was very much, almost
  pathetically in earnest.</p>

  <p>"It is very dear of you, uncle, to propose such a thing," she declared,
  "and it isn't that I mind poverty, or anything of that sort, but I'm
  beginning to find out what it means to be independent, and I couldn't let go.
  I've been gathering up my own life, bit by bit, into my own keeping. I have
  been terrified to death more than once. I've had horrible moments of fear and
  dread. There are things about my present post which I don't like, but I'm
  winning my way through and I couldn't give it up&mdash;my independence, I
  mean.&mdash;I'd like to see just as much of you as you have time to spare,"
  she went on, all the more earnestly as she saw the disappointment in his
  face. "We might go out together into the country sometimes, or walk in the
  parks. I'm afraid I was a little ungrateful and selfish down at Norchester.
  I'd try and make up for it if I could. But as to giving up work, or coming
  back to live with you, I couldn't. Here's my address," she concluded,
  scribbling on a piece of paper and passing it to him. "You can come and see
  me there, if you like. I share rooms with another girl. She isn't really bad,
  and she's going to be married in the autumn. There are lots of things we
  could do together&mdash;things that don't cost money, I mean."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone rose a little abruptly to his feet. He seemed to be very
  busy looking at the clock.</p>

  <p>"I must be on my way to the city," he announced. "I go on duty at six
  o'clock. I'm glad to have seen you, girl."</p>

  <p>He left her with an abruptness which was almost surly and rode on the top
  of a bus to his destination, looking steadily before him with unseeing eyes.
  Arrived there, he found a message to report at once at Mr. Garner's private
  office. He made his way there and found Matthew finishing the signing of his
  letters. The latter glanced up at the sound of the opening of the door.</p>

  <p>"That you, Stone?" he said. "Wait a moment."</p>

  <p>Hat in hand, Benjamin Stone awaited his employer's pleasure. Presently the
  typist was dismissed. Matthew leaned back in his chair.</p>

  <p>"You can sit down, if you like," he invited graciously. "No one else is
  likely to come in."</p>

  <p>"You left word that you wished to speak to me," Benjamin Stone replied, as
  he drew a chair towards him.</p>

  <p>Matthew nodded.</p>

  <p>"I've just come back from Norchester," he said, "had three or four days
  there. New factory is running at full power. Five hundred gross last
  week."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone made no comment whatever. He simply sat still and
  waited.</p>

  <p>"There's more competition down there than I thought," Matthew went on.
  "Beddingtons and Brown Brothers, and those people Richards &amp; Copley, seem
  to have gone ahead tremendously. Do you think their banks finance them?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell," was the cold reply. "They were always money-making
  businesses."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but it's their plant that is so amazing," Matthew observed. "Each
  one of those houses I have mentioned seems to have installed every machine
  known to the trade, on the most favourable terms. I imagined, too, that we
  should derive a considerable advantage there from being able to pay cash for
  all our leather. I can't believe that it is a fact, but I have been told that
  all the three firms I have mentioned do the same thing."</p>

  <p>"They are sound business undertakings," Benjamin Stone remarked.</p>

  <p>"I know that," Matthew assented, a little irritably, "but the fact remains
  that a firm of manufacturers, to be able to pay cash for their machinery, and
  cash for the whole of the raw material that goes into their place, must have
  the command of an immense amount of capital. What I can't make out is where
  it comes from. They are all three limited companies&mdash;forty thousand,
  sixty thousand, and a hundred thousand. The capital represented by those
  figures wouldn't be anything like enough to enable them to pay cash as they
  are doing."</p>

  <p>"I can give you no information on these matters," Benjamin Stone
  declared.</p>

  <p>"You haven't even heard whether it is true that an amalgamation between
  the three is proposed?" Matthew enquired, looking across at the older man
  keenly.</p>

  <p>"There were rumours of that, even in my day," was the grudging response.
  "If you have just come up from Norchester, though, you should know more about
  it than I do."</p>

  <p>Matthew nodded.</p>

  <p>"You don't hear often from your old friends, I suppose?" he said. "It's
  the same all the world over. You lose your money, and they scuttle as fast as
  they can. What about the chapel?"</p>

  <p>"The chapel was endowed," Benjamin Stone replied.</p>

  <p>"Well, they ought to give you back a bit out of the income," Matthew
  declared.</p>

  <p>"It is not necessary," was the cold reply. "I am able to live quite well
  upon my salary."</p>

  <p>Matthew looked across at him with eyes of wonder.</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul!" he muttered. "Three pounds a week, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Less insurance," the other reminded him.</p>

  <p>"Well, things change," Matthew remarked complacently. "Would it interest
  you to know how much I have added to my capital account within the last six
  months?"</p>

  <p>"Not particularly."</p>

  <p>"No use being grumpy about it," Matthew went on. "I have added exactly
  twenty-eight thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone said not a word. Something about his expression irritated
  the younger man.</p>

  <p>"You look as though you didn't believe me," he snapped.</p>

  <p>"It is not for me to disbelieve any man unless he is proved to be a liar,"
  Benjamin Stone declared. "The thought that crossed my mind was that a copy of
  the last balance sheet of the firm was recently distributed to the
  employ&eacute;s of the firm who are shareholders, and was there for every one
  to see. The net profit for the whole year was, I think, a hundred and ten
  thousand pounds. An eighth part of that&mdash;it is no secret, is it, that
  your interest is an eighth share?&mdash;amounts to something under fourteen
  thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>Matthew was, for a moment, slightly discomposed.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you think that's very clever of you," he remarked. "There's
  just one little thing, however, that you failed to take into account. A
  shrewd man to-day doesn't rely wholly upon what he makes in business."</p>

  <p>"You mean that he may speculate?"</p>

  <p>Matthew smiled.</p>

  <p>"'Speculation' is the word to use when women and professional men meddle
  with things they know nothing about. When a man like myself goes on to the
  money market, he deals with certainties."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry that I can give you no information respecting affairs in
  Norchester," he said. "With regard to the rest, I have never wished you three
  who were brought up under my charge anything but well, and I congratulate you
  upon your wonderful good fortune. I trust that it may continue. If you have
  quite finished with me now, I expect I am wanted to lock up."</p>

  <p>Matthew nodded carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Tell one of them to get me a taxi, as you go out," he instructed.</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone reached the door without reply. From the threshold he
  turned around.</p>

  <p>"If I keep silence," he said, "I may be sorry for it some day. If I speak,
  you will probably jeer at me. You have every right to. Nevertheless, it has
  come to my knowledge&mdash;indirectly, maybe, but from a very sound
  source&mdash;that a great disturbance in the money market is to be expected
  within the next few months. I am told there is to be a great fall in every
  description of industrial and mining shares."</p>

  <p>Matthew stood looking at the speaker for a moment or two in genuine
  surprise. Then he laughed boisterously.</p>

  <p>"Thanks!" he exclaimed. "I'll keep my eyes open, I hadn't heard of it. I
  had rather fancied, in fact, that things might be the other way. You've been
  palling up with some of the stockbrokers' office keepers, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"My information is probably valueless," was the quiet admission.</p>

  <p>Matthew was in high good humour.</p>

  <p>"Going to sell out yourself," he asked, "or are you going to work a bear
  on the market?"</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone closed the door. Matthew went out, chuckling, to his
  waiting taxicab.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b-7"
     name="b-7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Matthew was evidently right. Markets went up steadily for
  weeks, and he continued to make money. People began to talk about a boom.
  Certainly prices everywhere seemed immovable. The most ordinary industrial
  share was hard to buy at market figures. The whole City of London, with open
  cheque books, seemed to be struggling to find investments. Matthew gloated
  over his financial papers every morning. One day he passed Benjamin Stone, as
  the latter was leaving the place after his night's duty.</p>

  <p>"Slump a bit overdue, isn't it, Stone?" he remarked facetiously.</p>

  <p>The older man half hesitated, seemed about to say something, but passed on
  instead with a slight salute. Matthew went happily on his way. He strolled
  through the crowded streets, realising with every step something of his old
  ambitions. He was a man of import in the greatest city in the world. He was a
  member of a great firm. He was one of those who understood the money markets
  of the world. He was passing, through sheer genius for money-making, into the
  ranks of the wealthy. His pilgrimage to Threadneedle Street was a
  self-glorified processional. When he entered his stock broker's office,
  clerks sprung from their stools; he was escorted like a royal personage
  through the crowded room in which ordinary people might wait. The senior
  partner, seldom to be seen, the Delphic oracle of the place, made him
  welcome.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Mr. Garner," he said. "My congratulations! You are the most
  wonderful diviner amongst our client&egrave;le."</p>

  <p>Matthew shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Nothing in it but common sense," he observed, "common sense and
  foresight. Any one ought to have been able to see what was coming."</p>

  <p>"They're saying this morning that this is only the beginning of the boom,"
  the stockbroker observed. "I should like to have your opinion, Mr. Garner?
  Your finger is on the pulse of the commercial world, so to speak. How do
  things seem to you?"</p>

  <p>Matthew took a small calendar from his pocket and studied it.</p>

  <p>"To-day is the seventh of February," he remarked. "I have gone carefully
  into all the conditions of trade, and I fancy you will find the present boom
  will last until between Easter and Whitsuntide."</p>

  <p>"Unofficially," the stockbroker confided, "I have heard very nearly the
  same opinion from a high official source&mdash;some one connected with the
  Treasury, in fact&mdash;only this morning. Odd that you should have arrived
  at the same conclusion."</p>

  <p>"The puzzle to me," Matthew pronounced, helping himself to a cigarette
  from the box which the stockbroker had pushed towards him, "is how men of
  intelligence, who have an opportunity for gauging the industrial situation,
  and some insight into politics, can ever misread the probable tendencies of
  the markets."</p>

  <p>"They don't," the other replied. "You would be amazed, Mr. Garner, if I
  were to tell you the amount of money which only our regular clients have made
  during the last ten years, by approaching the matter in the same spirit as
  your own. They are not all so correct in their judgments, perhaps, but I
  could tell you the names of half a dozen men in the city to-day who are round
  about the million mark, and who have made the greater part of their fortune
  by judicious buying and selling."</p>

  <p>"Who loses the money, then?" Matthew asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you," the stockbroker explained. "The money is lost by the
  multitude of small gamblers who go in for what really is wild-cat
  speculation. They gamble in mines&mdash;unproven mines, I mean&mdash;or any
  crazy speculation there is going which they think may bring them in a fortune
  for nothing. They are the sprats of the market, of course, and, fortunately
  for us, there are shoals and shoals of them. They lose their little bit and
  another takes their place. All the time, the big, understanding operator, who
  deals in the sound shares of the world, goes on his way making money, as make
  money he must."</p>

  <p>"Very interesting," Matthew murmured. "Just how do I stand with you, Mr.
  Morgan?"</p>

  <p>The stockbroker touched a hidden bell let into his table. It was a
  singularity of his environment that on the very handsome desk before which he
  sat there was no telephone, no speaking tube, absolutely nothing to indicate
  the fact that this was the sanctum of one of the largest dealers in stocks
  and shares in the City of London. But almost as he touched the bell, an inner
  door opened noiselessly and a man stood there upon the threshold,
  waiting&mdash;a tall, dark man with bright eyes and nervous manner. It was he
  who sat before a dozen telephones, his employer's mouthpiece and second self.
  It was he who, every ten minutes in busy times, himself carried into that
  inner office the long strip whereon changing prices were recorded.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Garner's account, Samuels."</p>

  <p>"Eleven thousand, two hundred and ninety-seven pounds to credit, sir," was
  the unhesitating reply. "Cheque waiting here now for signature."</p>

  <p>Matthew considered for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Carry it forward," he directed. "I shall be dealing within the next few
  days."</p>

  <p>The stockbroker nodded. His second self faded away.</p>

  <p>Matthew took up a financial paper which he had been carrying.</p>

  <p>"I have come to the conclusion, Mr. Morgan," he said, "that the lowest
  priced of what I call the legitimate stocks to-day are Home Railways."</p>

  <p>Mr. Morgan scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>"They are the best value of anything upon the market for large dealing,"
  he assented. "They have only one drawback."</p>

  <p>Matthew smiled in a superior manner.</p>

  <p>"The fear of a strike, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely! If any one could guarantee that there would be no strike for
  twelve months, I should say that there would be a fifteen per cent. rise in
  Home Rails within the next ten days."</p>

  <p>"I quite agree with you," Matthew declared. "I do not wish you to make use
  of what I am telling you, until my operations are complete, but I have
  special information upon the matter. I was dining last night at the house of
  a Cabinet Minister"&mdash;for all his cleverness and adaptability, Matthew
  could not refrain from a slight access of bumptiousness in his manner as he
  made the statement&mdash;"and after dinner, the conversation became
  confidential. I cannot repeat it in detail, but, from certain facts which
  were stated, I was able to come to the definite conclusion that there will be
  no strike."</p>

  <p>The stockbroker nodded.</p>

  <p>"You are a very fortunate man, Mr. Garner," he said. "It is just such
  information as this on which men make fortunes."</p>

  <p>"I mean to make one myself," Matthew rejoined coolly. "Last night, before
  I went to bed, I pencilled out the various shares amongst which I intend to
  distribute my operations. You will find them here, Mr. Morgan."</p>

  <p>He took a slip of paper from his pocketbook and passed it across the
  table. Mr. Morgan adjusted his eyeglass and glanced it through. Matthew
  watched covertly for some signs of emotion in his face, for to him the
  operation he proposed appeared gigantic. The stockbroker, however, remained
  imperturbable.</p>

  <p>"Yes, a good selection," he said. "Just five hundred thousand pounds. You
  will leave it to me to distribute the amount in as near as possible this
  proportion?"</p>

  <p>"Do your best," Matthew acquiesced. "I fancy the later issues of the last
  two upon the list more than anything, but prices must of course guide you. If
  there are any movements, remember that, as before, I do not wish to hear a
  word from you at London Wall. Every communication of any sort is to be
  addressed to Belgrave Square."</p>

  <p>"I quite understand," Mr. Morgan agreed. "One never even hears of your
  partners on the Stock Exchange."</p>

  <p>"They are both very rich men," Matthew replied; "they are both, in fact,
  millionaires. They value money simply and entirely for the luxury, the sport
  and the freedom which it brings them. They cannot spend their incomes, and
  they have therefore no interest in increasing their capital. I am unlike them
  from two points of view. Firstly, I have not their capital; secondly, I have
  not their indifference to money itself."</p>

  <p>"You'll be a richer man than either of them before you die, Mr. Garner,"
  the stockbroker remarked.</p>

  <p>"I intend to be a richer man than either of them before I am even
  middle-aged," was the confident reply.</p>

  <p>Matthew went on his way to lunch at an expensive restaurant with his wife,
  who was wearing a most expensive set of sables, a hat from the most expensive
  milliner in London, and jewellery which seemed to surround her with a hard
  and unbecoming brilliance. They sat at the best table in the room, for which
  Matthew had duly paid in judiciously distributed tips. Their luncheon was
  elaborate and unnecessarily costly. The attention which they received was
  exceedingly gratifying to Mrs. Garner.</p>

  <p>"There is one thing I will say about you, Matthew," she conceded. "You do
  understand how to take a woman about. Poor Jeremiah had just one
  fault&mdash;a good fault in its way, mind&mdash;he could not bear to spend
  the money. He would sooner be pushed into a small table in an out-of-the-way
  corner, than tip the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>. He hated all tipping.
  He considered it parting with money unnecessarily."</p>

  <p>"He was wrong there," Matthew declared. "I don't know where you can get a
  better return for your money than by parting with a five-pound note to the
  head waiter of a place like this. I'm a poor man, unfortunately, but I'm
  never afraid of spending when there's a likely return for my money, and I
  don't make the mistake of expecting to get something for nothing."</p>

  <p>"You won't be a poor man long, Matthew," his wife rejoined equably.
  "Besides, you always have the satisfaction of knowing that you have a rich
  wife."</p>

  <p>Matthew, who had not quite forgiven her for her attitude with regard to
  the shares, smiled a little unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Adelaide," he admitted, "you're a rich woman. Whether you know how
  to make the best use of your money is another thing."</p>

  <p>She, too, smiled&mdash;not, however, so mirthlessly.</p>

  <p>"According to your ideas, I suppose," she remarked, "a woman should strip
  herself of everything she has in the world to line her husband's
  pockets."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort," he replied coldly. "My request to you to allow your
  shares to be registered in my name was purely a technical matter. You would
  have drawn your dividends as usual, and the only difference would have been
  that I should have occupied a more dignified position in the firm.&mdash;I
  was referring entirely to your personal expenditure."</p>

  <p>"Well, what's wrong with that?" she asked, a little sharply.</p>

  <p>"You spend a very large amount upon your clothes," he pointed out. "You
  also keep on adding&mdash;needlessly, I think&mdash;to your stock of
  jewellery. That sort of thing may give you a momentary pleasure, but it gets
  you nowhere. You are admittedly fond of society. If I were a woman, and
  possessed your income, I would guarantee that in six months I should be
  moving in an entirely new set. I should not, for instance, come in here
  without seeing a soul I knew, and have to rely upon the fashionable
  intelligence column of the newspapers, the next day, to tell me who our
  neighbours were."</p>

  <p>"And how would you set about that?" Mrs. Garner demanded, greatly
  interested.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Women find out about those things," he said, "but, if you want a hint or
  two from me, I'll give them to you. Instead of going to a flamboyant hotel at
  Brighton for a month in the winter, and meeting just the same city crowd whom
  we entertain at home, I would take the boy to the Riviera and stay at a good
  hotel. One way or another, you get to know people much more easily there than
  here. Let it be understood that you have money and are willing to spend it.
  Entertain lavishly. Take a fancy to some of the young people who belong to
  the right set. Make them presents, take them about in your car, take them to
  the restaurants where they can't afford to go. There are plenty of the people
  of the world you want to mix with, hungering for money and the things money
  buys, just as much as you are hungering to know the right sort of people. Put
  yourself in the way of meeting them, and let it be known that you are willing
  to pay for what you want. You'll get it right enough."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Garner was almost excited.</p>

  <p>"You're a smart fellow, Matthew," she declared. "No wonder you get on in
  business! I've a good mind to start for one of those foreign places next
  week."</p>

  <p>"I heard of a woman, the other day," he went on, "rich, but without
  anything like the claims to social recognition which you possess. She went to
  a first-class dressmaker, who had half a dozen titled people amongst her
  clients who couldn't pay their bills. She was a clever woman, and she let the
  dressmaker know what she wanted. A little meeting took place in the
  dressmaker's sitting room, invitations were exchanged, the dressmaker's bills
  were paid, everybody was happy. And if that woman were to come in here at
  this moment, you'd see her smiling and bowing to most of the people at these
  tables. You're content with too small things, Adelaide. None of the people
  with whom we are on visiting terms are worth knowing, except, of course, the
  Rawlinsons, where we dined last night, and that was entirely my affair."</p>

  <p>"You are absolutely right, Matthew," his wife confessed, with the light of
  battle already in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"If I am to give you any further advice," Matthew went on, "I should
  say&mdash;drop our present set altogether. They're not a hap'orth of good to
  us. They're all city people, and we've gone as far as we need to in the city
  already. Both my partners have refused a knighthood. It will be offered to me
  next year. I shall accept, simply because I want to go to Court. After that,
  I shall see that you are presented."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Garner was ecstatically happy. She even pressed her husband's
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Matthew dear," she said, "I love the days you come up west to lunch. What
  a pity you can't take a half holiday!"</p>

  <p>"Pretty mess they'd be in if I did," he remarked complacently.</p>

  <p>Glancing around the room, Mrs. Garner was suddenly attracted by what
  seemed to be a familiar face. Only a few tables away, Rosina, in one of
  Mathilde's latest morning confections, the acme of simplicity, but a miracle
  of cut and style, was lunching with Reggie Towers, who was paying one of his
  now infrequent visits to London. Mrs. Garner nudged her husband's arm.</p>

  <p>"That girl's face seems familiar," she observed. "No, the one on our
  right&mdash;very good-looking&mdash;very stylish, too. She's lunching with a
  young man in grey tweeds."</p>

  <p>Matthew recognised Rosina somewhat ruefully. Their eyes met for a moment.
  Rosina was looking away with a little smile when Matthew took his courage
  into both hands and bowed, a greeting which she returned graciously.</p>

  <p>"You know her?" Mrs. Garner exclaimed. "Tell me at once who she is?"</p>

  <p>"Her name is Rosina Vonet," Matthew replied. "She is the young lady I told
  you of, with whom I was brought up at Norchester. She has an engagement with
  Mathilde. You saw us talking in Kensington Gardens."</p>

  <p>"That hussy!" Mrs. Garner broke in indignantly. "To think that she dares
  to come into a place like this! And with that common-looking young man, too!
  I never heard such a thing. And as to your having been brought up with her at
  Norchester, Matthew, I simply don't believe it. You picked her up in
  Mathilde's shop. I saw her making eyes at you. Thank goodness, she is not
  there now!"</p>

  <p>"How do you know she is not?" Matthew asked.</p>

  <p>"Because I wrote to Madame Mathilde and told her a few plain truths. I
  told her I didn't want to see any frocks I might buy on that sort of person.
  And you dare to recognise her, Matthew! I am amazed at you."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Garner was angry, and when she was angry she at once became hot. She
  summoned the head waiter, who was passing.</p>

  <p>"Do tell me," she begged, "who are that strange-looking couple&mdash;the
  fifth table to the right? The girl I know is employed by my dressmaker. I
  can't imagine why you have such people here."</p>

  <p>The man, who had paused deferentially, glanced towards Rosina and her
  companion. Then he turned back to Mrs. Garner. His smile was a little
  sad.</p>

  <p>"The young lady I do not know, Madame," he announced. "She is not an
  habitu&eacute; here. The gentleman is Lord Reginald Towers, a son of the Duke
  of Rochester. He is a very good patron."</p>

  <p>"That young man?" Mrs. Garner gasped.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Madame!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Garner was silent for several moments after the man's departure.</p>

  <p>"I suppose, then, I must believe your story, Matthew," she acknowledged, a
  little irrelevantly. "Perhaps, on your way out, you had better stop and speak
  to the young woman. You might explain. Of course, if she was really brought
  up by your guardian, I should be sorry to have been&mdash;er&mdash;the cause
  of her losing her situation."</p>

  <p>Matthew sipped his wine thoughtfully. He was watching the two young
  people. Curiously enough, there was an acrid cloud of jealousy in his brain.
  Rosina had never seemed so attractive to him.</p>

  <p>"Better some other time," he muttered. "They don't look as though they
  cared about being disturbed just now. And besides&mdash;those
  clothes&mdash;and coming out with Lord anybody&mdash;it doesn't seem right,
  somehow. I must make enquiries."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Garner smiled tolerantly.</p>

  <p>"Quite right, Matthew dear," she assented. "Still, young people, you
  know&mdash;one can't close one's eyes to things altogether. The son of a
  duke, though! It does seem amazing!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b-8"
     name="b-8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Even up to the last moment, Rosina was curiously undecided.
  She sat on the hearthrug of the tiny sitting room, facing Violet and twirling
  Matthew's note around her finger. Violet's views upon the matter were
  positive and freely given.</p>

  <p>"Your other friend's away in Paris," she pointed out, "your young man's in
  New York&mdash;and I bet he's amusing himself some of the time&mdash;and
  you're such a modest little daisy that there's scarcely a man knows you well
  enough to ask you out. You've rung the changes on every cheap dish you can
  think of for dinner, for the last ten days, and to-night you admit it has to
  be bacon and eggs. And there you are, asked out to the Savoy to dine with a
  man you've known all your life, and you sit there hesitating about it! What's
  the matter? Aren't you hungry?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I am," Rosina confessed. "If ever I get into serious trouble,
  I'm sure it will be through my appetite."</p>

  <p>"Don't you like the man, then? He looked a bit stuffy, I thought, and
  frightened of his wife, but surely he won't eat you?"</p>

  <p>"I used to like Matthew quite a great deal," Rosina admitted. "He and I
  and Philip&mdash;but I've told you all about that, haven't I? But somehow,
  Matthew, since we came to London, seems to have changed. He never even looked
  at me before, down at Norchester. He was more like a very unaffectionate
  brother. From the first, up here, he's been different. I'm terrified of doing
  him an injustice, and yet, when I am alone with him, I am just as much
  terrified of what he's going to say next."</p>

  <p>"Shucks!" Violet exclaimed, taking off her slipper and contemplating its
  worn edges a little disconsolately. "You are a greenhorn, Rosina. I think
  it's rather fun to get a man into a corner, and, when you know all the time
  what he wants to say, dare him to say it. Since I've made up my mind to marry
  Victor, I'm enjoying the same sort of thing myself enormously. I'm going to
  dine to-morrow night with Johnnie Rudd. I shall be in just the same sort of
  box, only worse, because I have encouraged the poor little man. You may see
  me sweeping home in haughty solitude. Or you may not. I think I can manage
  him. It's so beautifully uplifting, too, to show a man how wrong he has been
  in his ideas. I dare say Johnnie, for instance, will think differently of the
  whole sex by the time I've finished with him. You must deal with your man in
  the same way."</p>

  <p>Rosina unscrewed the note from her finger and read it again. It was
  written from Belgrave Square, and there was a crest above the address:</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My dear Rosina</span>:</p>

  <p class="letter">I should like to hear all about you and Philip. As you
  don't care about Fretoli's, will you dine with me at the Savoy to-night at
  eight o'clock? There will be no time for you to send a reply, so I shall
  expect you there. If you don't come, I must dine by myself and we must fix
  another evening.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Ever yours,<br>
  <span class="smcap">Matthew</span>.</p>

  <p class="letter">P. S.&mdash;My wife is in Cannes.</p><br>

  <p>"I suppose I'd better go," Rosina decided.</p>

  <p>"You'll be a stupid donkey if you don't," Violet declared.</p>

  <p>Matthew was waiting for his guest in the entrance hall of the restaurant
  when she arrived. He came forward with a little exclamation of
  pleasure&mdash;a very carefully turned out, not undistinguished-looking man,
  with a touch, perhaps, of the old Matthew in his welcoming smile. Rosina was
  suddenly glad that she had come.</p>

  <p>"I love this place and hate it," she confided, as she descended the broad
  stairs by his side. "I almost fancied that I saw my dear old Jane McAlister
  sitting in that corner as I came in. I shall never forget her face when Mr.
  Erwen brought her out of bed at four o'clock in the morning!"</p>

  <p>"He was the first of your beaux, wasn't he?" Matthew remarked.</p>

  <p>"He was a very dear and considerate friend," she declared. "That is
  another of my memories here&mdash;his party on the first night of the play.
  It ended almost in tragedy, but it was the first time I had ever danced with
  any one who could dance&mdash;the first time I had ever been to a real
  party."</p>

  <p>"You go to plenty nowadays, I suppose?" he queried.</p>

  <p>She shook her head as she took her place at the little table to which she
  had been ushered.</p>

  <p>"To very few," she answered. "A friend took me out to lunch, the other
  day&mdash;the time I saw you and your wife. Is she still angry with me,
  Matthew?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he assured her. "She's quite got over that."</p>

  <p>"It seems odd to think of you as married," she went on. "Somehow or other,
  that possibility never cropped up in our conversations about the future, did
  it?"</p>

  <p>"It did not," he admitted. "I had no idea that such an opportunity would
  present itself. My marriage, you must understand, Rosina, was not one of
  affection."</p>

  <p>"Matthew," she exclaimed, "don't say anything so horrible!"</p>

  <p>"There is nothing horrible about it," he protested. "I married my wife
  because, by doing so, I consolidated my position with the firm."</p>

  <p>"And she?" Rosina asked curiously. "What does she get out of it?"</p>

  <p>"That is her lookout," Matthew replied. "She does not interfere with me.
  She is away now for two months. Naturally, I am a little lonely."</p>

  <p>"You must have heaps of friends."</p>

  <p>"I have a great many city and business friends," Matthew acknowledged.
  "When I leave the city, I like to forget them. Although I am a hard-working
  man, in my way I love pleasure. I like the best restaurants, good dinners,
  wine, and, if one is lucky enough to be able to get it, the companionship of
  some one as beautiful as you, Rosina."</p>

  <p>She laughed a little uneasily.</p>

  <p>"It isn't like you to pay compliments, Matthew," she declared.</p>

  <p>"I have often felt disposed to say such things to you," he told her. "It
  is you yourself who sometimes make it difficult."</p>

  <p>"It was rather unkind of your wife to write to Madame," she remarked
  irrelevantly.</p>

  <p>Matthew frowned.</p>

  <p>"I was going to speak of that," he said. "If Madame sent you away, I think
  I ought to make you some compensation. I should like to talk to you seriously
  on the matter, Rosina."</p>

  <p>"There is no need to," she assured him. "It did make things a little
  awkward for me, and Madame practically dismissed me, but Mr. Vaculos&mdash;he
  is a partner&mdash;got her to change her mind. I am only allowed in the
  show-room now at times, though, and never when there is any chance of your
  wife calling."</p>

  <p>"You're still with Mathilde, then?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Matthew," she laughed, "look at me! You think, perhaps, that this
  gown I am wearing is simple. It would cost you sixty guineas as it is, and
  forty guineas to have copied."</p>

  <p>"Is it your own, then?" he asked, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Don't be an idiot," she replied. "My salary is four pounds ten a week,
  and I have to live out of it, besides buy clothes. Madame lends a few of us
  models to wear, so long as we come to these places. There are often lady
  journalists and people about. I am in a Mathilde frock. It is the only way a
  real artist in clothes can advertise."</p>

  <p>"Then those clothes you wore at luncheon the other day?"</p>

  <p>"Mathilde's&mdash;even the silk stockings, which had to be dyed a special
  colour. I hope you noticed them. Madame is very gracious to me when I lunch
  or dine with that particular young man. He has brought all his sisters to the
  place."</p>

  <p>Matthew was vaguely disappointed. He had to reconstruct his ideas.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it rather a precarious sort of existence for you?" he asked. "No
  one particular to fall back upon, and no chance of saving anything?"</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"My dear Matthew," she replied, "I wasn't made like you&mdash;always
  building up for the future. Some day or other, and before very long, too, I
  am going to marry Philip. Until then, I shall struggle along, somehow or
  other. I am beginning to have faith in my star. I've wriggled out of some
  terrible messes."</p>

  <p>"You hear from Philip, then?" he enquired gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Every week," she answered. "He has had a hard fight, but he has had one
  or two things published over there&mdash;things he is proud of, things I have
  been proud to read. It's difficult work at first&mdash;there seems to be so
  much larger a market for inferior stuff&mdash;but he isn't likely to make
  another mistake. His novel is finished now, and his play is nearly ready. In
  the long run I am sure he will succeed. Directly there is a definite sign of
  it, I shall go out to him or he will come home to me."</p>

  <p>Matthew sipped his champagne. Then he leaned across the table. He had the
  air of a man who has arrived at a long-sought-for decision.</p>

  <p>"Rosina," he said, "do you know that I am very fond of you?"</p>

  <p>"I hope you are," she answered. "I think that you must be or you would not
  trouble to ask me out."</p>

  <p>"I am very fond of you indeed," Matthew repeated, "and I am sometimes very
  lonely. There is no one I like to be with so much. Couldn't I see a little
  more of you, Rosina?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him across the little cluster of pink roses. This was rather
  an unfamiliar Matthew. For a moment she prayed for Violet's callousness.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid not&mdash;not very much more, Matthew," she replied. "You
  see, although we are such old friends, there is your wife&mdash;and she will
  be home soon. I should hate to go out with you secretly, and I should hate
  still more for Madame to have another letter and for me to lose my
  place."</p>

  <p>He cleared his throat, which had somehow become a little dry.</p>

  <p>"I should like," he declared, "to make you independent of Madame."</p>

  <p>With the crisis, her courage seemed to rise.</p>

  <p>"You could not do that, Matthew," she assured him.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he demanded. "I am rich, Rosina. I am becoming richer every
  day. You do not understand the power of wealth&mdash;you never have done. I
  can buy you those frocks you wear on sufferance, I can buy you the pearls you
  ought to be wearing around your neck, I can&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was a singular, almost dramatic pause in Matthew's speech. A single
  word, spoken at an adjoining table, seemed to have arrested the full flow of
  his eloquence. He sat with his mouth still a little open, his whole being
  concentrated in an effort of listening. For Rosina, hoping against hope, her
  weapons of wilful misunderstanding momentarily blunted, the interlude came as
  a blessed relief. From thoughts of herself, however, she passed immediately
  to concern for her companion. His tense expression was entirely
  unnatural.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter, Matthew?" she enquired. "Are you feeling ill?"</p>

  <p>He summoned a waiter.</p>

  <p>"Send for an evening paper for me," he directed,&mdash;"quickly! Let me
  have it in less than a minute."</p>

  <p>The man called for a page boy, who departed hastily. Matthew turned back
  to his companion.</p>

  <p>"Let me see, where was I?" he asked, a trifle unsteadily.</p>

  <p>"Never mind about that," she begged. "You were being just a little silly.
  Tell me what was the matter with you just then?"</p>

  <p>"Those fools at the next table," he explained, dropping his voice, "they
  spoke of a rumour&mdash;an impossible rumour&mdash;which would affect me
  financially. It gave me a shock for a moment.&mdash;What was I going to
  say?&mdash;Oh, I know! That young man you were lunching with, the other day.
  Is he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Is he in love with you?"</p>

  <p>"Not the least bit in the world," she declared. "He is just nice, that's
  all, and he knows I'm lonely. He has an appointment now in Paris at the
  Embassy&mdash;second secretary&mdash;so I don't see much of him."</p>

  <p>"He's a queer stick if he can take you about and not be in love with you,"
  Matthew observed. "I don't think I could."</p>

  <p>Rosina leaned back in her place and laughed.</p>

  <p>"My dear Matthew!" she expostulated. "Fancy your being in love with
  anybody!"</p>

  <p>The boy stood by his side with a paper. Matthew snatched at it. The
  strange look came back to his eyes. Rosina, turning away from him to glance
  around the room, was aware of a little murmur of excitement. People were
  consulting their watches, some parties were breaking up and making an early
  departure. Suddenly Rosina heard the paper crumpled up in Matthew's hand.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what has happened?" he exclaimed, in a harsh, unnatural tone.
  "There's been some rank treason somewhere, either in the Cabinet or amongst
  the Labour leaders. There's a railway and transport strike from to-night.
  After midnight, there won't be a train running in Great Britain. Curse these
  Trades Union men! You can't trust them a yard. If I were the Government, I'd
  pack the lot in prison!"</p>

  <p>Rosina was a little dazed. There seemed to her no great tragedy in what
  had happened.</p>

  <p>"Why are all the people leaving?" she asked, looking around.</p>

  <p>"People who live in the suburbs are anxious to get home," he answered.
  "The trains may be taken off at any moment. There'll be a run on taxicabs,
  too."</p>

  <p>"Ought we to go?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Matthew hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I had meant to dance with you downstairs," he said, "and I haven't
  finished&mdash;what I wanted to say. That will all have to stand over for a
  time, though. This strike will mean a period of great anxiety for me. If you
  don't mind, Rosina, I will drive you home. I have the car waiting. I must go
  to the club and see if there is any later news."</p>

  <p>Rosina decided in future to believe in Providence. She concealed her
  relief, however, and was duly sympathetic. On the way home, she made one
  effort with a view to the future.</p>

  <p>"Matthew dear," she said, patting his hand, "I want to thank you immensely
  for bringing me out. I've loved the evening. I'm afraid I'm terribly fond of
  pleasure and good dinners. I hope all your troubles will pass and that you
  will take me out again. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, go on," he invited, as she hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I didn't like very much the way you were talking, Matthew, just before we
  heard about the strike. I don't understand you. I had a horrible feeling that
  I didn't want to. I believe, in my heart, that I am just silly&mdash;that you
  are only teasing me. But I don't want to be teased that way."</p>

  <p>He looked at her gloomily, half suspicious, half angry.</p>

  <p>"What do you expect me to believe?" he muttered. "You're not so amazingly
  different from every other young woman in the world. At Norchester we were
  children. Up here we've both learnt our lesson. It's no good trying to live
  like one of the babes in the wood. You've had adventures,
  flirtations&mdash;you must have had them."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I'm in the least like one of the babes in the wood,
  Matthew," she protested gently. "I don't pretend not to understand a great
  many things I knew nothing about at Norchester. I don't pretend that in many
  ways I am not disappointed. Life seemed such a fairy story&mdash;and it
  isn't. But apart from that, Matthew, I am not so very much changed, and I
  never shall be. I love beautiful things, just as I did in Norchester, when we
  used to escape from a week of ugliness and lie under the pine trees, and feel
  the sunshine, and listen to the wind in the corn, and hear the larks singing
  overhead. And I hate ugly things. In Norchester I used to think that the
  ugliest things in the world were the house we lived in, the chapel we were
  driven to, the factory we worked in, the rough crowds in the streets. There
  is another sort of ugliness, worse than any of this, more terrifying. I've
  found out about that, too, Matthew, but, after all, it doesn't come near
  us&mdash;unless we go out of our way to draw it into our lives."</p>

  <p>The car stopped. Matthew handed her out.</p>

  <p>"Can't I come up for a few minutes?" he begged.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Followers not allowed," she laughed. "We're friends, Matthew, aren't we?"
  she added, holding out her hand. "And you understand?"</p>

  <p>"I understand that you're an unpractical visionary," he declared
  vigorously. "You can't live in the world you're living in and keep on telling
  yourself it's Utopia.&mdash;I'm not myself to-night, though. I can't argue.
  But there's this difference between us. I love the world I see around me, and
  I want to live in it to the fullest extent. You seem to blunder your way
  along&mdash;to build fancies of an impossible Paradise which never existed
  and never could exist, and flatter yourself that some one will let down a
  silken ladder out of heaven for you to climb up and take your place there. It
  may do for you. I like the pleasures I can see and feel."</p>

  <p>She turned away with a little wave of the hand. It was with a sense of
  relief that she felt the pavement beneath her feet.</p>

  <p>"We'll compare notes&mdash;later on," she suggested.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b-9"
     name="b-9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Matthew, face to face with unexpected disaster, showed signs
  of collapse. For the first week or so after the declaration of the strike, he
  had been as bumptious and imperturbable as ever. The strain, however, was
  beginning to tell. The fall in Home Rails had been phenomenal. The meeting of
  his last settlement had absorbed every penny Matthew possessed in the world.
  The fateful day had once more arrived. The account was in the inner pocket of
  his coat, a hideous document. Late that afternoon, for the first time, his
  stockbrokers had disobeyed instructions and sent him an urgent note to his
  office. The note was curt, almost peremptory&mdash;"unless the debit balance
  of twenty-eight thousand nine hundred pounds were paid before eleven o'clock
  the following morning, the whole block of shares would be thrown upon the
  market." The result would be nothing short of utter and complete ruin.</p>

  <p>He had left the office at the usual hour and made his way home purely out
  of habit. His wife was still on the Riviera, and on the whole he was thankful
  for her absence. Any appeal to her he knew would be as hopeless as to his
  partners. They both of them had a horror of speculation in any shape or form.
  He even remembered tardily that he was prohibited, in the articles of
  partnership, from all dealings upon the Stock Exchange save for purposes of
  investment. He sat in his elaborately furnished study for an hour after his
  return from the city, biting his finger nails and trying to think of some way
  out of his difficulty. In the end he took up the telephone directory, found
  out his stockbroker's private address, rang him up, was referred to his club,
  and, sending for a taxi, drove round there. He waited in the hall for some
  five minutes, whilst his name was taken in. When the stockbroker at last
  appeared, he received his client with only superficial cordiality.</p>

  <p>"I called to see you in the city twice to-day," Matthew announced, as they
  shook hands. "They said you were out, both times."</p>

  <p>Mr. Morgan nodded.</p>

  <p>"I was in the House myself for some time. Wretched day altogether. You
  know, we're pretty well up against a panic. Unless the Government steps in,
  there'll be some very serious news from the city within the next few weeks.
  Sorry you're having such a bad time, Mr. Garner. You're not so much to be
  pitied, though, as the weaker men who can't see it through."</p>

  <p>Matthew bluffed for all he was worth, stood on the soles of his feet and
  did his best to re&euml;stablish his self-confidence.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Morgan," he said, "I'm not one of the weaker men, as you know,
  but it would be a very great convenience to me if you could do something
  about my settlement to-morrow."</p>

  <p>The stockbroker was horrified.</p>

  <p>"My dear Mr. Garner," he protested, "for heaven's sake, don't talk like
  that! Every penny the firm possesses is being used. We've pushed our bankers
  to the uttermost limit. If it were to save one of our most favoured clients
  from bankruptcy, we couldn't find a half, or even a quarter of your
  settlement."</p>

  <p>"It will mean a heavy loss to me," Matthew declared. "I shall have to sell
  stocks which I never intended to put on the market at all."</p>

  <p>"But we're all losing money every day," Mr. Morgan insisted, a little
  impatiently. "You mustn't mind that. You've made money, now and then. You
  must lose with the rest sometimes. You'll make it up some day. Have a drink,
  won't you, and then I must run away."</p>

  <p>Matthew accepted a whisky and soda in order to gain time.</p>

  <p>"I'm not squealing about losing a bit," he said, "but you must remember
  that this settlement will bring my losses up to pretty well fifty thousand
  pounds."</p>

  <p>The stockbroker shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You took a risk," he reminded his client. "You were quite certain there
  was going to be no strike. If there hadn't been one, you'd have netted thirty
  or forty thousand pounds by now."</p>

  <p>Matthew half closed his eyes. The thought was agony.</p>

  <p>"I felt sure that I could trust my information," he said. "It came from an
  inside source. However, that's neither here nor there. I want you to do me a
  favour, Mr. Morgan. I've never asked as much yet from any man breathing. I
  want that settlement carried over."</p>

  <p>"It absolutely cannot be done," was the uncompromising reply. "It isn't a
  question of lack of confidence, or anything of that sort. It simply is that
  we haven't the money. We're not a poor firm, but every penny of our capital
  is being used up to the hilt."</p>

  <p>Matthew was silent for a moment. The stockbroker finished his whisky and
  soda and glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to hurry you," he said, "but I have an early dinner this
  evening."</p>

  <p>"You can't help me at all, then?" Matthew persisted, doggedly.</p>

  <p>"I can't. There's only one thing to be said. You spoke of having to
  realise some shares at a loss. If they are really gilt-edged, and there is
  sufficient margin, I might stretch a point and get the money advanced upon
  them. I know the bank would make a great favour of it, but I'd like to do
  anything I could to oblige a client."</p>

  <p>Matthew looked out of the windows of the club and down St. James's Street.
  There was nothing in his face to indicate the nature of his thoughts. The
  stockbroker's suggestion had brought to a definite issue a certain
  half-formed idea which had haunted him for the last hour. He seemed to be
  looking into another world, to have lost his own identity, to be gazing in
  upon another man's anguish.</p>

  <p>"The shares are gilt-edged," he said, moistening his lips.</p>

  <p>"What are they?" the stockbroker enquired.</p>

  <p>"Government bonds, some of them, and shares in my own firm."</p>

  <p>Mr. Morgan nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'll get you an advance of five-eighths of anything you can bring of that
  description," he promised. "I'd rather you'd done it through your own bank,
  though."</p>

  <p>Matthew shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather do it through you," he declared bluntly. "Anyhow, I'll think
  it over."</p>

  <p>The stockbroker rose to his feet with alacrity.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget," he begged, "that you have only till the opening of the
  House to-morrow. I never doubted but that your cheque was in the post."</p>

  <p>Matthew stood gloomily looking out of the window for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Well," he concluded, "I suppose the situation must be faced. I'll either
  send you round my cheque or bring you the shares, before eleven."</p>

  <p>"Good man! I am sorry to seem disobliging, but we're going through hell in
  the city."</p>

  <p>Matthew walked slowly back to Belgrave Square. Arrived there, he changed
  deliberately for dinner, ate his meal alone and in solemn silence.
  Afterwards, he left word that if he were wanted he would be at his club, and,
  taking his hat and coat, left the house. At the corner of the Square, he took
  a taxi to the city and alighted near the Mansion House. From there he walked
  through the now deserted streets to the imposing premises of Messrs.
  Faringdon, Nettleby, Ford and Company. He let himself in with his latchkey. A
  flood of electric light immediately blazed out. Benjamin Stone rose from his
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Glad to find you're on the alert, Stone," Matthew said patronisingly.
  "Everybody gone, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Some hours ago," was the surprised reply.</p>

  <p>"I want some papers I left in Mr. Faringdon's room," Matthew explained.
  "Whilst I'm here, I may write a few letters. You needn't be disturbed if you
  hear me moving about."</p>

  <p>The night watchman resumed his seat and Matthew passed on. He made his way
  to Mr. Faringdon's private office, closed the door and turned on the light.
  For a moment or two he sat listening. Assured that Benjamin Stone was not
  moving about, he selected a key from his bunch and opened his partner's desk.
  It was a key which he had had made for other reasons, and which he had
  already used more than once when in search of information. This time he was
  in search of something more definite. Within five minutes he had found what
  he sought&mdash;a bunch of keys on which was that of the firm's strong room.
  He locked up the desk and once more listened. There was a queer silence in
  the streets outside and in the great building. Assured that no one was
  stirring, Matthew turned out the light and made his way slowly back along the
  corridor to his own office. He remained there for several moments, deep in
  thought.</p>

  <p>Then he went back to where Benjamin Stone was seated.</p>

  <p>"Stone," he said, "I must have an evening paper with a list of the mails
  in. You'll find a boy somewhere between here and Moorgate Street. I'll look
  after the place."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone rose slowly to his feet and took his hat down from a nail
  behind.</p>

  <p>"It is against my express orders to leave the warehouse at any time whilst
  on duty," he declared coldly. "You are willing, I have no doubt, to take that
  responsibility?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally," Matthew replied. "Close the door behind you. I shall be in my
  office, close at hand."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone did as he was bidden. Matthew waited until he heard the
  closing of the door and the departing footsteps on the paved courtyard. Then
  he made his way to the strong room, a floor lower down. He was some time
  before he found the correct key on Mr. Faringdon's bunch. He opened the door
  at last, however. Around the wall were neatly fitting iron receptacles, each
  one labelled. There were specifications of patents applied for and granted,
  formul&aelig; in connection with the dyeing branch of their business, the
  charters of their Asiatic company,&mdash;many documents of interest and
  importance which seemed to have been left undisturbed for years. Each
  receptacle had a black number painted upon it. At Number 15, which was
  somewhat larger than the rest, Matthew paused. The card in the little slot
  bore the single word&mdash;Securities. Matthew's fingers were hot as he
  searched for the key. He found it at last. The compartment slid open almost
  of its own accord. His eyes glittered as he bent over the neatly arranged
  rows of packets, all tied up, sealed and labelled. There were shares in many
  subsidiary companies, mostly in foreign countries, which he put back after a
  glance at them; a thin packet, labelled:</p>

  <p class="center">GOVERNMENT BONDS<br>
  THE PROPERTY OF MR. GEORGE NETTLEBY</p>

  <p>which he slipped at once into his pocket. Continuing his search, he came
  presently to an oblong packet, labelled:</p>

  <p class="center">SHARE CERTIFICATES IN<br>
  FARINGDON, NETTLEBY, FORD &amp; CO.<br>
  Nos. 80-180.<br>
  THE PROPERTY OF MR. ARTHUR FARINGDON</p>

  <p>And finally, another and thicker packet of Government bonds, labelled with
  their cost price&mdash;&pound;15,000&mdash;and also inscribed with the name
  of Mr. Arthur Faringdon. Matthew paused to make a rapid calculation. The
  shares of the firm stood at 120, even at this time of terrible depression. If
  he reckoned them at par, there were ten thousand pounds' worth of these, in
  hundred-pound shares. The two lots of Government bonds together came to
  thirty thousand pounds. It was enough for his purpose. He transferred the
  three packets to his pocket and carefully rearranged the documents which he
  had disturbed. As soon as he had them all in order, he closed the
  compartment. Then he drew a little breath, surprised to find himself
  trembling in every limb. A horrible fear seemed suddenly to be paralysing
  him. He had heard no footsteps, nor any sound, yet he knew that he was not
  alone. He tried to look around. Almost at the same moment, Benjamin Stone's
  harsh voice broke the terrible stillness.</p>

  <p>"Take your hands out of your pockets. Hold them up&mdash;quick!"</p>

  <p>He obeyed, shivering, a conscience-stricken coward. Benjamin Stone, stern
  and pale, was standing upon the threshold&mdash;Benjamin the preacher and the
  man of peace&mdash;with a most murderous-looking automatic pistol held in
  fingers as motionless as a vice.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b-10"
     name="b-10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Matthew! My God, it's Matthew!"</p>

  <p>Matthew, in those first few seconds, was utterly unable to rise to the
  situation. Even although the identity of the intruder was in some respects a
  relief to him, he was still the craven. He realised afterwards the great
  opportunity he had missed. With courage and composure, his presence in the
  strong room of the firm might easily have been explained. As it was, he
  shrank back, a self-convicted felon. Benjamin Stone's pistol was slowly
  lowered.</p>

  <p>"I had no idea that it was you in here," he said, in a strained, unnatural
  tone. "I thought some thief must have lain concealed in the premises. Hadn't
  you better put back those bonds?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot," Matthew found strength to reply. "I need the use of them for a
  day or two. Come up to my office and I will explain."</p>

  <p>"Whatever explanations you may attempt to offer," Benjamin Stone assured
  him, "you will not leave these premises with those bonds. Better put them
  back now and save time."</p>

  <p>"I'm only borrowing them," Matthew declared. "They will be back here in
  less than a fortnight."</p>

  <p>"They will be back in less time than that," was the grim reply. "Give me
  the keys of this room."</p>

  <p>Matthew was as yet without powers of resistance. He produced them without
  a word, the room was locked up, and, obeying the other's almost fierce
  gesture, he led the way to his office.</p>

  <p>"Hand me those packets," Benjamin Stone ordered, as soon as they had
  arrived at their destination.</p>

  <p>Matthew did as he was told and threw himself into his chair sullenly.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he muttered, "remember I got you this job. I've a perfect
  right to enter my own strong room. I'm one of the partners of the firm."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone gathered the three packets into his hand. He took a seat
  opposite his late ward and leaned forward in his place.</p>

  <p>"Matthew Garner," he said, "there are a few things which Mr. Faringdon
  himself told me when I took up my position here. One was that no living
  person save himself and Mr. Nettleby had the right to enter the strong room.
  The keys are kept locked up in the desk in his private office. You have no
  right in that office, nor have you any right to a key to Mr. Faringdon's
  desk. You entered the strong room as a thief. You cannot contradict it. It is
  there, written in your face. What does it mean?"</p>

  <p>"It means just this," Matthew replied. "I have lost money on the Stock
  Exchange. I need thirty thousand pounds to-morrow. I have tried every way to
  raise it and failed. I intended to borrow those bonds for a week or two,
  until things mended. My stockbroker had agreed to lend the money upon them,
  and everything would have been all right but for your damnable
  interference."</p>

  <p>"To borrow them!" Benjamin Stone repeated bitterly. "Was there ever a
  thief who didn't call it borrowing!"</p>

  <p>"I wish to God I'd never found you this job!" Matthew exclaimed. "You're
  such an old Psalm-singer, I suppose there's no getting round you? What'll you
  hand those bonds over for and hold your tongue? A thousand pounds?"</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone seemed suddenly to have become curiously inattentive. His
  mind had wandered back to another few moments of agony&mdash;another empty
  building, stealthy footsteps in the distance, the slamming of a door. He
  suddenly leaned across the table.</p>

  <p>"Matthew Garner, answer me truthfully, if you hope for any mercy in this
  world. There were fifty pounds missing from my cash box the Sunday night
  before you left Norchester."</p>

  <p>"I took it," Matthew announced coolly. "I considered I had a right to it.
  You underpaid me all the time I worked for you, and, when we left, you gave
  fifty pounds to Philip and fifty to Rosina, and to me only the legacy which
  was my due. I had a key to the factory and I went down and helped
  myself."</p>

  <p>There was mingled relief and horror in Benjamin's face.</p>

  <p>"And I thought it was Philip!" he muttered. "I thought it was Philip and
  that perhaps Rosina knew! He was branded in my thoughts as a thief. My heart
  was as a stone towards them.&mdash;God forgive me!"</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone was shaken. Opposite him, Matthew sat wondering whether a
  sudden attack might not give him possession of the bonds. Then he remembered.
  There would be the morrow. Nothing short of murder would seal the man's
  lips.</p>

  <p>"It was Philip's fault that I was able to steal the money," he declared.
  "He went away on the Saturday and left the cash box open on the office table.
  In any case, how could you have helped them? You haven't much left, I should
  think, out of your three pounds a week."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone was thoughtful for a few moments. Then he rose to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"Come with me and replace those bonds," he directed. "Afterwards, I have
  something to say to you of importance."</p>

  <p>"Listen to reason," Matthew began,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I will listen to no word from you till the bonds are replaced," Benjamin
  Stone interrupted sternly. "When that is done, I will speak of your
  troubles."</p>

  <p>Matthew rose reluctantly, and together they passed along the corridor,
  down a flight of stairs, into the strong room. Silently, the younger man
  opened the compartment and replaced the packets. Then they retraced their
  steps. When they had regained his office, Matthew was livid with mingled
  anger and fear.</p>

  <p>"This means my ruin," he groaned.</p>

  <p>"Sit down and tell me how you got into this trouble?" Benjamin Stone
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"I needed money to equalise my position with the other members of the
  firm," Matthew explained. "I have been operating successfully on the Stock
  Exchange ever since I was made a partner. Just before the strike, I made my
  first mistake. I bought Home Rails when they looked low. A Cabinet Minister
  had assured me that there would be no strike."</p>

  <p>"You gambled, lost, and were willing to become a thief!" Benjamin Stone
  pointed out. "Now listen to me. Exactly what sum is it you require
  to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty-eight thousand, nine hundred pounds."</p>

  <p>"Give me the name of your stockbrokers and I will settle with them."</p>

  <p>Matthew gazed across the table, open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk nonsense!" he exclaimed roughly. "You are a ruined man and you
  know it. You couldn't raise twenty-eight thousand, nine hundred pounds to
  save your life."</p>

  <p>"You are ill-informed," Benjamin Stone observed coldly. "The sum you
  mention shall be paid, and I will undertake to carry your stocks through
  until the strike is over."</p>

  <p>His tone and manner were alike convincing. Yet it was hard for Matthew to
  grasp the truth. He sat in his place, still open-mouthed and incredulous.</p>

  <p>"You are one of those men, Matthew," his late guardian continued, "who are
  naturally shrewd but idiotically egotistical. You rely on your own judgments
  and you jump to conclusions. You considered me a fool because I refused to
  put in new machinery at my factory. The reason I did not put it in was
  because the premises were old and inadequate, and because the three other
  principal factories in Norchester, all equipped in the most modern fashion,
  belonged to me. It is untrue that I have met with any financial misfortunes.
  I have never spoken to any living person of my wealth, but I
  am&mdash;wealthy."</p>

  <p>"Then what the devil are you doing here at three pounds a week?" Matthew
  asked, in a dazed fashion.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you," the other explained. "It is, in a sense, my penance. I
  was, responsible for the life and the upbringing of you three young people.
  However good my intentions may have been as a guardian, I was a failure.
  Philip has become a drunkard and an exile. Of Rosina I do not dare to think,
  but if she has saved herself, it has been without any help from me. You,
  without heart or conscience, seemed on the road to material prosperity, but
  even you have broken down. When I realised my failure, I determined to do
  penance for it. I, too, started life again, earning what I could. I sometimes
  thought you might have done a little better for me than three pounds a week.
  Fate, at any rate, has given me a good chance of earning my money."</p>

  <p>Matthew wiped the perspiration from his forehead. He was beginning to feel
  himself again. It was amazing but fortuitous. He was going to be saved from
  ruin&mdash;saved from walking day by day in the shadow of disgrace.</p>

  <p>"I was had, then, when I bought your factory!" he gasped. "You knew all
  the time that you had the trade in your hands?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely!"</p>

  <p>Matthew stared across the table. There was a look of reluctant admiration
  in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Well," he exclaimed, "I never dreamed that any one could fool me so
  completely at a bargain!"</p>

  <p>"The man who thinks only of himself and who indulges in underhand means is
  often the loser in any sort of a transaction," Benjamin Stone declared. "To
  attempt to make use of my confidential clerk, to buy his soul and conscience
  for a paltry fifty pounds, was like you, Matthew. It was a very foolish
  action."</p>

  <p>"Why was it?" Matthew demanded. "You kept the fellow half starved, down
  under your thumb, for thirty years. He ought to have been fair game for
  anything of the sort."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone smiled&mdash;a quaint, mirthless smile, but with infinite
  depths of contempt.</p>

  <p>"You gained your imagined knowledge," he said, "through prying into my
  wages book. To show to what foolish conclusions your methods may lead you, I
  will tell you this. At the end of his tenth year of service, I gave
  Mulholland two hundred and fifty pounds. At the end of his twentieth year, I
  gave him a thousand pounds. At the end of his thirtieth year, I gave him two
  thousand, five hundred pounds. Mulholland is a saving man and has invested
  carefully. According to his lights, he is well off."</p>

  <p>Matthew fought stubbornly against his humiliation.</p>

  <p>"You treated your employ&eacute;s better than your wards," he
  muttered.</p>

  <p>"I treated my wards as I myself was treated when I was young, without
  taking into account the variation in dispositions. There I was wrong. It is
  for that reason, I do penance. You alone I understood and treated as I meant
  to. If you had been a fair man, with Christian principles, I should have
  brought you up to be my partner. I knew you to be untrustworthy, so I kept
  you where you belonged. For any imagined wrong I did you, remember that
  to-night I have saved you from felony, and that to-morrow I propose to save
  you from ruin."</p>

  <p>Matthew wiped his forehead. He was speechless. Benjamin Stone rose slowly
  to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Now let me remind you," he concluded, "that I am night watchman here. It
  is time you left the premises."</p>

  <p>Matthew, too, rose to his feet, put on his hat and coat, and made his way,
  followed by his companion, to the outside door. Arrived there, he hesitated
  for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I have been in great distress for several days," he said. "My brain is
  not quite so clear as it was. There's no mistake about any of this, is there?
  I've given you my settlement paper. You're going to see Morgan to-morrow
  morning? They expect payment by eleven o'clock."</p>

  <p>"They will be satisfied," Benjamin Stone assured him sternly. "You need
  have no fear, Matthew. What I have promised, I shall perform. I have not
  even, as you may have remarked, preached to you. You are, in my opinion, a
  man without moral or religious sense. It was for you and your like, perhaps,
  that the most cynical of our proverbs was framed. Keep it in the foreground
  of your mind&mdash;'<i>Honesty is the best policy.</i>' In plain
  words&mdash;honesty pays best."</p>

  <p>Matthew walked out into the silent street, a little dizzy, scarcely yet
  realising his good fortune. Benjamin Stone went back to his porter's seat and
  sat there for the rest of the night with folded arms and knitted brows.
  Nothing else in the events of the last hour troubled him for a moment beside
  the one amazing fact&mdash;Philip was innocent!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b-11"
     name="b-11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Rosina experienced a distinctly disagreeable shock when,
  after having gone through the usual preliminaries, she carried her own suit
  case on to the platform at Victoria and found herself confronted with Mr.
  Vaculos, whom she had not seen for several months. He appeared to recognise
  her with some difficulty, and he glanced at the bag which she was carrying in
  an irritated manner.</p>

  <p>"What on earth are you doing with that thing?" he demanded, making,
  however, no attempt to relieve her of it. "Surely there are plenty of
  porters?"</p>

  <p>"It is quite light," Rosina declared. "I prefer to carry it myself."</p>

  <p>"I scarcely see why," he protested. "Your expenses are paid for the trip,
  and I do not think that Madame would care to see her assistants doing
  anything so undignified as carrying their own luggage. Is that all you
  have?"</p>

  <p>"Everything," she replied. "Madame told me that I should not require any
  evening dresses. If she takes me out at all, it will be to note the effect of
  what she is offered there."</p>

  <p>Vaculos shrugged his shoulders and pointed to the guard, who was standing
  with a carriage door open.</p>

  <p>"There is a place for you in there. I hope you don't mind a 'Ladies Only.'
  From what I remember of you," he added, with a faint smile, "I think it
  should appeal."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you a little disagreeable?" she asked sweetly. "I don't think
  South America has agreed with you."</p>

  <p>"I am in a bad temper," he admitted. "Madame has been losing money whilst
  I have been away. I am quite sure that she has been pushing the wrong styles.
  I intend this trip to Paris to be a very important one. I wished her to bring
  two or three of you. Where is Miss Shaw?"</p>

  <p>"I left her just starting out as usual," Rosina replied. "I am quite sure
  that Madame never said anything about bringing her, or she would have been
  delighted. She is engaged to marry Monsieur Victor, who lives in Paris. By
  the by," she added, "have you seen Madame? I waited for her outside for half
  an hour."</p>

  <p>"I think I saw her stepping into the Pullman," Vaculos replied. "Our seats
  are in there. I shall probably see you upon the boat."</p>

  <p>He turned away and Rosina took her place. Already she had recovered from
  her little shock of apprehension at finding him there. It was obvious that
  his penchant for her had departed. She settled down to enjoy the journey,
  every detail of which was novel and interesting.</p>

  <p>At Folkestone, in deference to Vaculos's wishes, she allowed a porter to
  carry her bag on to the steamer and a steward to procure a chair for her. It
  was a pleasant, sunny day, but with rather a heavy sea running, and it did
  not surprise Rosina that she saw nothing of either Vaculos or Madame on deck.
  She thoroughly enjoyed the crossing, however, her first view of the French
  coast, and her landing. She followed a little crowd into the Customs House,
  and afterwards walked up and down, looking into the windows of the French
  train, with a sense of complete content. The very smell of the engine, the
  mixed odours of the harbour, the old lady with the dolls, the bareheaded
  Frenchwoman, with glossy black hair, who sold the newspapers, were all
  delights to her. Presently, however, the absence of both Vaculos and Madame
  began to cause her some anxiety. She looked in at the windows of the train,
  which was rapidly filling. Time passed on. A Cook's interpreter, to whom she
  appealed, told her that the train was due to start in five minutes. She was
  on the point of climbing in and taking any vacant place, when Vaculos came
  strolling down the platform, smoking a cigarette. For the first time in her
  life, she was pleased to see him.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't find any one!" she exclaimed. "The train is just going to
  start."</p>

  <p>"Plenty of time," he replied. "Here we are."</p>

  <p>She followed him on to the train and he led the way to an empty
  carriage.</p>

  <p>"Had anything to eat since you left London?" he asked casually.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid of missing you," she confessed. "I haven't even seen
  Madame."</p>

  <p>Vaculos was busy talking to a boy through the open window. Presently he
  handed her a cardboard box, in which was a large, delicious chicken sandwich
  and a half bottle of white wine. The horn sounded, the train began to move.
  Rosina, who had already commenced to eat her sandwich, suddenly started.</p>

  <p>"But where is Madame?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>Her companion looked across at her for a moment in faint surprise.</p>

  <p>"I forgot I hadn't seen you on the boat," he remarked. "I had a message
  brought to me just as the train was leaving Victoria. Madame came on by the
  early train this morning."</p>

  <p>Rosina forgot all about her sandwich. She stared across at Vaculos, who
  had drawn a novel from his bag and was settling down in his corner.</p>

  <p>"Gone by the earlier train?" she exclaimed. "Why, I saw her last night.
  She didn't say a word about it. Why couldn't I have gone with her?"</p>

  <p>Vaculos looked over the top of his book.</p>

  <p>"There is no accounting for Madame lately," he replied, a little
  irritably. "Personally, I feel quite sure that I know why she has gone on
  like this. She wishes to see first the manager of Felix, from whom we buy
  most of our models, prepare him for my coming, and arrange with him to let
  her down lightly over her bad purchases. It was very silly of her. I shall
  get to know all I want from Felix."</p>

  <p>He continued reading his novel. Somehow or other, his indifference became
  communicated to Rosina. She finished her sandwich with appetite, drank a
  little of the wine, and leaned back in her corner composedly, watching the
  scenery with immense interest. She had even no sense of uneasiness at being
  alone with Vaculos. It was a corridor carriage, with people passing all the
  time, and her companion himself showed not the slightest interest in her
  presence. Time sped on, with scarcely a word between the two. The first call
  to dinner passed unnoticed. About an hour afterwards, however, Vaculos
  glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"If you wish to arrange your hair or wash," he suggested, "you will find a
  toilette room just behind. We shall be going in to dinner in ten
  minutes."</p>

  <p>"Dinner?" Rosina exclaimed, springing to her feet. "Do we have it on the
  train? What fun!"</p>

  <p>"That depends upon the point of view," he remarked, a little drily. "When
  you have arrived at my age, and understand the importance of dining, you will
  probably regret the fact that the train does not get you into Paris a couple
  of hours earlier. However, I suppose we must make the best of it."</p>

  <p>The best of it, Rosina thought, was very good indeed, when she found
  herself seated, a few minutes later, at a small table in the dining car. The
  slight differences of service, manners and food all delighted her. Everything
  tasted delicious. She even found herself sipping champagne without being
  aware of the fact. Her companion had become more polite, but his manner
  inspired her with no anxiety whatever. He talked amusingly of his experiences
  in Buenos Ayres and New York. He had met Douglas Erwen, and, to her delight,
  had even heard of Philip.</p>

  <p>"I read a story of your young man's in one of the best American
  magazines," he announced. "It wasn't at all bad. Erwen told me that he has
  written really a clever novel, and that he will be coming over to England
  before long."</p>

  <p>Rosina beamed with joy.</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you how happy Philip's success out there has made me," she
  confided. "He was a great anxiety in London. We were both of us miserably
  poor, and Philip was in the hands of that wretched little editor, who made
  him drink and do poor work. It was Mr. Erwen who took him right away and gave
  him a fresh start."</p>

  <p>"Wonderfully unselfish of him, under the circumstances," Vaculos remarked
  quietly.</p>

  <p>It was the first disturbing note. Rosina flushed a little.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Erwen has been a dear and generous friend to me," she said. "I told
  him about Philip and he understood."</p>

  <p>"As a purely academic question," her companion asked thoughtfully,
  "doesn't such intense fidelity impose rather severe restrictions upon your
  life?"</p>

  <p>"Why should it?" she exclaimed. "I am not a slave to my fidelity. I go to
  the theatre with any one when I am asked, and lunch or dine out, if any one
  is good enough to want me to."</p>

  <p>"Lunching and dining and the theatre are well enough in their way,"
  Vaculos observed, "but they are only trifles."</p>

  <p>"For anything except the trifles," Rosina rejoined, "I am perfectly
  content to wait. Every girl is, who cares."</p>

  <p>He sighed.</p>

  <p>"It is a patience," he observed, "which is a remarkable characteristic of
  your sex&mdash;a characteristic, I am afraid, unshared even by the most
  conscientious of ours."</p>

  <p>"Are you suggesting," she asked, smiling across at him, "that Philip is
  making love to some other girl?"</p>

  <p>"From what I have heard of the young man," Vaculos replied, "I imagine him
  to be a person with ordinary human instincts. However, this shows signs of
  becoming an unprofitable discussion. We will leave Mr. Philip Garth out of
  the question. You shall tell me whether you are looking forward with pleasure
  to your visit to Paris?"</p>

  <p>"To see Paris itself will be wonderful," Rosina declared. "I don't expect
  much in the way of amusements. Madame will naturally be busy with her
  friends. I shall be content just to be there."</p>

  <p>Vaculos filled her glass and his own and replaced the bottle in the
  rack.</p>

  <p>"I have a psychological interest," he said, "in a girl's first visit to
  Paris. You are so prompt to misunderstand that I should fear to make the
  suggestion to you. I have always thought that it would be delightful to take
  a young woman with your appreciation of life, and your ignorance, to a
  charming hotel, say in the Bois, and to become a sort of fantastic
  godfather&mdash;her escort but her shadow; to take her to the
  shops&mdash;they are very wonderful shops, I can assure you&mdash;and have
  her select the clothes she liked best; to the furriers, and see her walk away
  in Russian sables for the daytime, and with a chinchilla coat for evenings.
  Then I would give her luncheon at one of those amazing restaurants in the
  Bois&mdash;the Pr&eacute; Catelan or the Armenonville&mdash;where the
  smartest of the <i>beau monde</i> are to be seen&mdash;where she could look
  at the wonderful women of the world and be herself looked at. Afterwards, we
  would leave in our waiting automobile for Auteuil, and watch the jumping and
  see more wonderful frocks. Tea, perhaps, at one of the fashionable hotels,
  and a long rest before dinner, with a perfect maid to see that the bath was
  the right temperature and the bath salts not sprinkled in too lavishly. Then,
  the perfect toilette, dinner at one of the great restaurants, where one may
  watch the men and women best worth watching in the great world; a box at the
  theatre; supper afterwards to the music of violins; a round of the gay
  caf&eacute;s, with a dance here and there; a song, perhaps, from a great
  artiste of the Opera House, happy in her hours of pleasure&mdash;a dance from
  the premi&egrave;re danseuse of the ballet, giving from sheer
  light-heartedness what thousands have paid their thirty francs to see. And so
  home, with all the rest and beauty of wonderful apartments waiting."</p>

  <p>"You take one's breath away!" Rosina exclaimed, with glowing eyes. "You
  make it sound too wonderful."</p>

  <p>"It could all come true," Vaculos said, with a little sigh, "it could all
  become reality to-morrow&mdash;if I could find the companion I desired."</p>

  <p>"To remain their fairy godfather?" she challenged, perhaps a little
  unwisely.</p>

  <p>He smiled, and the light which flashed for a moment in those pale eyes
  warned her of her mistake.</p>

  <p>"That would depend," he said. "One has one's dreams. One follows them
  sometimes to the gates of disappointment."</p>

  <p>Her old uneasiness in the man's presence was back again. Rosina felt
  herself shivering. The unusualness of the situation was suddenly large in her
  thoughts. Vaculos, watching her intently, saw the change. He was not
  altogether dissatisfied, however. Her delight at his graphic little picture
  had given him heart.</p>

  <p>"Life would be a dull place but for these wanderings into Fancy Land," he
  declared. "I shall probably never find the companion to whom I should care to
  devote myself, my thousands will remain in the bank, and I shall fritter away
  my evenings with small pleasures. You, on the other hand, will never realise
  the subtle and everlasting joy of having been, even for a few weeks, the
  princess of the most wonderful city in the world. You will sacrifice the
  marvel of those few weeks to a certain piquant but disastrous narrowness of
  outlook. I, too, must remain with my feet upon the earth because I am cursed
  with the selective instinct, and what I would do for one, I would do for no
  other in the world."</p>

  <p>The electric fans were hard at work, but there was steam upon the carriage
  windows and Rosina was suddenly conscious of the heat. She rose a little
  abruptly from her place.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if I go back to the carriage?" she asked. "It is so
  insufferably hot here."</p>

  <p>Vaculos assented absent-mindedly.</p>

  <p>"I will follow you," he said, "when I have finished my cigar."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b-12"
     name="b-12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The train roared on into a gulf of darkness, oscillating now
  more than ever. Every now and then, myriads of lights flashed out on either
  side of the way. Paris drew nearer. Rosina sat and gazed out of the window.
  Her thoughts were in disorder. The sense of excitement within her, which
  increased with the widening of the lights around, had ceased to be altogether
  pleasant. She was not exactly afraid&mdash;Vaculos had been too clever for
  that&mdash;but a sense of new and unsuspected dangers seemed mingled with her
  anticipations. She was very human, and it was possible that those wonderful
  word pictures of her companion's had left a grain or two of their poison in
  her veins. Vaculos entered, a few minutes later, to find her still
  absorbed.</p>

  <p>"We shall be in Paris in ten minutes," he announced, opening his dressing
  case and disclosing for a moment its luxurious equipment. "My servant is on
  the train somewhere. He will see the luggage through the Customs, and drop
  your bag at the hotel where you are staying, before he brings mine to my
  rooms."</p>

  <p>She was conscious of a sudden sense of relief.</p>

  <p>"Will Madame be at the station?" she enquired.</p>

  <p>"Extremely improbable," he replied drily. "Madame, if I know anything
  about her, is at the present moment concluding an elaborate dinner at Henry's
  or the Caf&eacute; de Paris with Monsieur Felix. She will turn up at your
  hotel later. Your room is at any rate engaged&mdash;I happen to know
  that."</p>

  <p>"Can't you put me in a carriage and let me find my way there?" she asked,
  with simulated indifference.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, if you prefer it," he assented. "My automobile will be
  waiting, however, and I pass your door. By the by, you must give me your
  keys. Fran&ccedil;ois will need them for the <i>douanes</i>."</p>

  <p>"I haven't any," she replied. "I have no valuables, and my bag isn't
  locked."</p>

  <p>"That sounds a little pathetic," he remarked. "However&mdash;"</p>

  <p>One more series of violent oscillations, punctuated by a little succession
  of jolts, and the train glided in under the great arch of the Gare du Nord. A
  dark-faced man-servant and a chauffeur appeared as though by magic at
  Vaculos's elbow. He gave a few instructions to both and led Rosina from the
  station. Outside, a very handsome car was waiting. Vaculos handed his
  companion in.</p>

  <p>"It is a wonderfully warm night," he observed. "I wonder whether you would
  like to have the car open? The first view of the boulevards at this time of
  night is rather impressive."</p>

  <p>"I should like it very much," Rosina answered, a little nervously. "You
  are sure, however, that this is not taking you out of your way?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," he assured her. "My rooms are not a stone's-throw
  away. Madame has rather a queer taste in hotels," he went on, as he took the
  place by her side. "She prefers a very small, private one&mdash;the Hotel des
  Beaux Arts, up in the Rue Beaux Arts. No fun for you, I am afraid, for there
  isn't even a restaurant. She will be certain to take you out to dine one
  evening before you go back, though."</p>

  <p>"It is quite sufficient for me to be here," Rosina declared. "I am sure I
  am going to find it all wonderful."</p>

  <p>They descended into the Place de l'Op&eacute;ra, where they paused for a
  moment, Vaculos pointing out the Opera House itself, the Caf&eacute; de la
  Paix, and other objects of interest. They crossed the Boulevard des Italiens,
  the Place Vend&ocirc;me, and turned into the Champs Elys&eacute;es. Rosina
  had forgotten her uneasiness. She was drinking in the wonder and the beauty
  of it all. Presently they left the Champs Elys&eacute;es and turned to the
  right. They were in a neighbourhood here of broad, clean-swept, cobbled
  streets, with handsome, silent-looking houses. The car came to a standstill
  before one of these. The second man upon the box touched a bell in the wall,
  and a courtyard door was opened. Inside was a pleasant vista&mdash;a square
  with a fountain playing in the middle, flowers and a flagged walk all round;
  opposite, a handsome swing door.</p>

  <p>"Is this really an hotel?" Rosina asked wonderingly. "It looks like a
  palace."</p>

  <p>"It is an hotel, right enough," her companion assured her. "If you really
  mean that you speak no French at all, I had better come in and hand you over
  to Madame."</p>

  <p>"It is very stupid of me," Rosina confessed, "but I can't speak a
  word."</p>

  <p>They skirted one side of the square and passed in through the mahogany
  swing doors. A <i>concierge</i> in gorgeous livery rose from his place and
  welcomed them with a low bow. On the other side of the marble hall was a
  lift. A young woman, neatly dressed in black and wearing a cap, came hurrying
  towards them, smiling. She conversed with Vaculos for some moments in rapid
  French, finally producing a half-sheet of paper, which she handed to him. He
  nodded and turned to Rosina.</p>

  <p>"Madame, as I expected," he remarked with a smile, "has dined out and gone
  to the theatre. She has left a message, asking you to meet her at half-past
  eleven for supper at the Abbaye Restaurant in the Montmartre. I will call for
  you at a quarter past eleven and take you to her.</p>

  <p>"But I have no clothes for anything of that sort!" Rosina exclaimed, in
  dismay.</p>

  <p>Vaculos passed her the half sheet of notepaper. The few lines upon it were
  in Madame's hand-writing&mdash;a hasty, pencilled scrawl:</p>

  <p class="letter">Ask Mr. Vaculos to bring you to the Abbaye Restaurant,
  Montmartre, at 11.30. If he is engaged, come alone. I have sent in some
  clothes for you. Marie will get you anything you want.</p>

  <p>"I have an engagement for later on," Vaculos announced indifferently, "but
  I shall be able to take you up to the restaurant. I see that it is ten
  o'clock already. You had better let Marie show you to your room."</p>

  <p>He raised his hat and turned away. Rosina followed the maid to the lift
  and ascended to the third storey. They traversed a broad corridor, lit with
  shaded lights and thickly carpeted. The maid opened with a latchkey a heavy
  mahogany door. They crossed a little hall and entered a delightful bedroom,
  decorated in rose pink and white. Through an inner door, Rosina caught sight
  of a white marble bathroom.</p>

  <p>"Is this really my room?" she gasped. "It seems much too wonderful. And
  where is Madame's?"</p>

  <p>The maid smiled and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"<i>Ne comprends pas un mot d'Anglais</i>," she murmured.</p>

  <p>Rosina looked all around her. Upon the bed were spread out a white and
  gold evening dress, shoes and stockings and a theatre coat. Marie pointed to
  them and smiled. Then she hurried into the bathroom and turned on the taps.
  Rosina made a sign of assent, and abandoned herself to the luxury of her
  surroundings.</p>

  <p>At a quarter past eleven there was a knock at an inner door, which as yet
  Rosina had not noticed. The maid opened it and stood on one side.</p>

  <p>"<i>C'est monsieur</i>," she announced.</p>

  <p>Rosina passed into the sitting room, where Vaculos was waiting. Again she
  was surprised at the magnificence of the apartment in which she found
  herself. The walls were panelled with light satinwood; there were some
  exquisite pieces of statuary, wonderful etchings and water colours, furniture
  which, even to her inexperience, was priceless. Vaculos watched her. He
  seemed paler than ever.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Vaculos, what sort of an hotel is this?" she asked, in a troubled
  tone. "I never saw such a magnificent room in my life. It is more like your
  own house in London."</p>

  <p>He did not immediately answer her. She looked at him, and something in his
  gaze brought the colour to her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"The room is ordinary," he declared. "It is you who are the most beautiful
  thing that ever breathed."</p>

  <p>"You are trying to turn my head," she laughed uneasily. "Let us go. I am
  very anxious to find Madame."</p>

  <p>He opened the door.</p>

  <p>"The room is well enough," he observed, glancing around. "This is one of
  the differences one always notices in Paris. The appointments of the hotels
  are far more elegant."</p>

  <p>They rang for the lift. Rosina looked up and down the dimly lit
  corridor.</p>

  <p>"It is extraordinarily quiet here," she remarked.</p>

  <p>Vaculos shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"As I told you before, it is Madame's choice, not mine," he said. "I find
  the larger, cosmopolitan hotels more amusing."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that it must be terribly expensive," she reflected.</p>

  <p>He smoothed the nap of his silk hat softly.</p>

  <p>"Madame has extravagant tastes," he murmured.</p>

  <p>They passed across the luxurious hall, with its white marble floor and
  costly rugs. Again the magnificent-looking <i>concierge</i> rose and bowed.
  There was no hotel bureau, no sign of any public room. Rosina drew a little
  breath of relief as she stepped into the automobile.</p>

  <p>"You do not like your quarters?" he asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"They seem too magnificent to be real," she acknowledged frankly. "I feel
  as though I had wandered into some sort of modernised fairyland. I have never
  had a maid to prepare my bath and dress me before. I have never slept in such
  a beautiful room. I have never worn such beautiful clothes."</p>

  <p>"They become you," he assured her. "You are a little austere in your
  outlook but you were made for luxury. I should like to think of you living in
  just those surroundings."</p>

  <p>"It would be wonderful," she admitted. "I am afraid my austerity, as you
  call it, is only superficial. I love the feel of my clothes, the warmth and
  luxury of those rooms, and I adore riding in this wonderful limousine."</p>

  <p>He turned towards her. He lowered his voice a little. It was never an
  unpleasant voice, and at this moment it was less steady than
  usual&mdash;almost caressing.</p>

  <p>"Why not offer yourself as the subject of that experiment I spoke of in
  the train?" he suggested. "Will you try it for a month&mdash;the rooms just
  as they are; your wardrobe&mdash;just what you select; this car or any other
  you may prefer&mdash;and myself, your <i>cavalier servant</i>? It would be of
  no use your trying it without me, because in Paris, more than any other
  place, you must have an escort wherever you go."</p>

  <p>"It would be very wonderful," Rosina laughed, "but what about Cinderella
  when her reign was over? How should I feel when I got back to Violet and our
  attic rooms, and wore clothes all day at Madame's for other people to
  buy?"</p>

  <p>"The month," he murmured, "might be extended."</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"Then the awakening would be still more terrible," she said.&mdash;"How I
  love these streets! And how happy the people all look!"</p>

  <p>"The French people have great gifts," he observed, accepting without
  protest her deliberate evasion. "They have consciences but they are not
  slaves to them, principles but they do not sacrifice their life to them. They
  feel the joy of living and they are not afraid of it. They take the goods the
  gods send. You will see no wrinkles or thoughtful faces to-night. You will
  see gaiety, which, after all, is more important than anything else in the
  world."</p>

  <p>They drew up in front of a brilliantly lighted restaurant. Their entrance
  was after the fashion of a triumphant reception. The <i>ma&icirc;tre
  d'h&ocirc;tel</i> met them almost in the street, the scarlet-coated leader of
  the orchestra came across the room to greet them, the manager himself hurried
  up, they were surrounded by servants to relieve Mr. Vaculos of his coat and
  hat and stick. All the time, compliments were being exchanged in rapid
  French. Rosina could understand nothing except that her escort was a very
  valued client.</p>

  <p>"Madame is not here!" she exclaimed, in a tone of disappointment.</p>

  <p>Vaculos glanced around the room.</p>

  <p>"It is quite early yet," he said. "I suppose the theatres are scarcely
  out."</p>

  <p>They were ushered to a table against the wall.</p>

  <p>"But this is only for two," Rosina protested, as she sank into the
  cushioned seat. "What about Madame and her friend?"</p>

  <p>"The tables here join," her companion pointed out. "The next table can
  easily be added to this."</p>

  <p>They were surrounded by a little crowd of satellites. The leader of the
  orchestra desired to know their pleasure, and Vaculos sent him away to play
  the waltz of the moment. To the <i>sommelier</i> he whispered only one word.
  From the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> he took the menu and studied
  it.</p>

  <p>"We expect friends," he said. "You can serve, however, a little caviare
  and hot toast for two, and open the wine as soon as it is cool enough."</p>

  <p>The <i>chef d'orchestre</i> drew his bow across his violin, the music of
  the waltz floated into their ears. Little streams of wonderfully dressed
  people were trooping in. Rosina leaned back in her seat and gave herself up
  to the seductive pleasure of the place. Yet her eyes kept wandering towards
  the door. If only Madame would come!</p>

  <p>Madame did not arrive but the supper did. Rosina crushed down her
  uneasiness, ate and drank, and did her best to be agreeable to her companion.
  Once or twice they danced. Vaculos danced well, if with little enterprise,
  and the novelty of dancing in such surroundings delighted her. Her companion
  pointed out to her the notabilities&mdash;the great French actor, the famous
  Russian danseuse, the Spanish woman for whose favours a king had sighed in
  vain, the great banker of the world, an American millionaire, an Italian
  prince with an historical name, and an English Cabinet Minister very much
  incognito. Vaculos appeared to know everybody. He was continually exchanging
  greetings with new arrivals, many of whom lingered, obviously in the hope of
  an introduction to his beautiful companion. Vaculos, however, was obdurate.
  He treated the jests of his acquaintances coldly, and their hints with
  non-comprehending silence. Once he turned to Rosina.</p>

  <p>"You are turning the heads of all these young men," he whispered. "You are
  very beautiful, Rosina."</p>

  <p>She looked at him, a little startled.</p>

  <p>"I think," he ventured, "that I have almost earned the right to your
  Christian name. You must admit that, considering this is Paris, my real home,
  and that I am your greatest admirer, the greatest admirer you will ever have
  in life, my behaviour has been exemplary."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a moment's sweet gravity.</p>

  <p>"You may call me Rosina," she said. "You are certainly being very kind to
  me. And I think you understand. I hope so much that you do."</p>

  <p>"It is not I," he replied, "who lack understanding. Rosina&mdash;be wise.
  You are, after all, very much alone in the world. I offer you a friendship
  which can remain the anchorage of your life."</p>

  <p>She felt suddenly very helpless. The whole atmosphere was throbbing with
  sensuous pleasures of every sort&mdash;the lilt of the music, the perfume
  from the women's hair and dresses, the delicious odour of fresh and rare
  fruit. Every one was talking and laughing gaily and unrestrainedly. The place
  had become a temple of pleasure. The words died away upon her lips. Then
  suddenly she sat very still. She looked across the room eagerly, and with a
  glad smile of welcome upon her parted lips. Standing a little apart from the
  group of young people with whom he had entered, looking directly across at
  her with a very grave expression in his good-natured face, was Lord Reginald
  Towers.</p>

  <p>"It's Reggie!" she exclaimed,&mdash;"Reggie Towers! Why doesn't he come
  and speak to me?&mdash;Reggie!"</p>

  <p>Vaculos frowned. He by no means shared his companion's enthusiasm. Very
  slowly the young man detached himself from his friends and came towards them.
  There was no answering smile upon his lips.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b-13"
     name="b-13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Rosina gave him both her hands. Not even his unusual gravity
  affected very much her joy at seeing him.</p>

  <p>"Reggie!" she exclaimed. "How delightful! Aren't I the last person in the
  world you expected to see here? You know Mr. Vaculos, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Reggie nodded to her companion but did not offer his hand.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing in Paris?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I came over this morning," she explained. "Madame is here&mdash;Mathilde,
  you know. We are going to look at models. To-morrow I shall be trying them on
  all day."</p>

  <p>"Madame Mathilde is not here," Reggie remarked, looking around.</p>

  <p>"She will be here directly," Rosina declared. "We came to meet her. She
  was out when I arrived at the hotel, but she left a note, asking me to get
  Mr. Vaculos to bring me here. She said she was coming after the theatre."</p>

  <p>The young man glanced at the table, laid for two, and looked back into
  Rosina's eyes. Perhaps he read there something of the anxiety from which she
  had never been entirely free all the evening.</p>

  <p>"What hotel are you staying at?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"Hotel des Beaux Arts," she replied. "Please forgive my bad accent. You
  know I can't speak French. I'm so horribly ashamed of myself."</p>

  <p>"Hotel des Beaux Arts," Reggie repeated. "In what quarter of Paris is
  that?"</p>

  <p>"It is a small, private hotel at which Madame has stayed for many years,"
  Vaculos explained. "I really do not know myself exactly where it is, but my
  chauffeur knows how to find it. I left Miss Vonet there, on my way from the
  Gare du Nord, and called for her afterwards."</p>

  <p>"It is a very beautiful place," Rosina said. "I never dreamed that there
  could be such magnificent furniture in any hotel."</p>

  <p>"I shall probably discover it in the telephone book," the young man
  remarked. "I shall certainly hope, Rosina, that you are able to spare me an
  hour or so whilst you are in Paris."</p>

  <p>"Any time Madame is not wanting me," she answered, "I shall love it. She
  must be here soon. Then I will ask her."</p>

  <p>He left them with a little reluctance. Again he did not offer to shake
  hands with Vaculos. He made his way to the far corner of the room, where his
  friends were already established. Vaculos looked after him with hate in his
  pale eyes.</p>

  <p>"I do not like your friend," he said slowly. "He has the manners of the
  English upstart."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry you do not approve," Rosina replied. "I am very fond indeed of
  Reggie Towers. He has been kind to me, and understanding.&mdash;I wish very
  much that Madame would come. I do not understand her leaving that note at the
  hotel and then not arriving."</p>

  <p>"There are many things in life which you do not understand yet," Vaculos
  replied. "Madame has a dear friend here&mdash;shall I say at once a lover?
  They dined together. It may be long before they come."</p>

  <p>"Then I think perhaps we had better go," Rosina suggested, a little
  timidly. "I have enjoyed it all so much. I do not wish to seem ungrateful,
  but I should like to go back to the hotel now."</p>

  <p>Vaculos glanced at his watch. He himself was surprised at the
  hour&mdash;it was past two o'clock.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he agreed, "shall we say in another ten minutes? Otherwise,
  your friend may think that he has frightened us away."</p>

  <p>Rosina laughed.</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't be so silly. I am not ashamed of anything I am doing. I am
  really very happy here. And you, Mr. Vaculos," she added, smiling up at him,
  "have been exceedingly kind to me."</p>

  <p>Vaculos called for his bill. There was something about Rosina's direct
  gaze which was almost disconcerting.</p>

  <p>"We may as well go," he said. "Madame has evidently forgotten all about
  us."</p>

  <p>She gave a little cry of dismay. She had just recognised her next-door
  neighbour, who had entered some time ago with a very flamboyant young
  Frenchwoman.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Victor!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>He made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"Be careful," he begged, under his breath. "Speak in English only. The
  young lady with me has a violent temper. Do not speak of Violet."</p>

  <p>"As it happens, I cannot speak French," Rosina replied. "Violet will be so
  disappointed. She was expecting you in London to-night."</p>

  <p>"One cannot always keep one's promises," he remarked, with a little shrug
  of the shoulders. "Still," he added, with a meaning glance at her companion,
  "I think it will be a fair bargain if we both of us say nothing."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she asked coldly.</p>

  <p>"Nothing! Oh, absolutely nothing!" the young man replied. "You are here at
  half-past two in the morning with Mr. Vaculos, I am here with Mademoiselle
  Ninette. That is all. I think that we had each better forget our
  meeting."</p>

  <p>"We came here to meet Madame Mathilde," Rosina explained. "We have been
  waiting for her for two hours."</p>

  <p>"You will wait much longer, I fear," Monsieur Victor observed, winking
  solemnly at Vaculos. "'Waiting for Madame Mathilde' will not exactly wash.
  Eh?&mdash;What is that?"</p>

  <p>Rosina looked from one to the other of the two men. She saw an angry
  glance flash from Vaculos' eyes, a look of partial comprehension in the
  other's. She rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>"I wish you good night, Monsieur Victor," she said. "I hope that to-morrow
  you will be able to go to England. Violet is very much distressed at your
  absence."</p>

  <p>"And I wish you a speedy meeting with Madame," was the cryptic reply.</p>

  <p>Rosina and her escort passed slowly down the restaurant towards the door.
  They were surrounded by the usual little crowd. Vaculos distributed largesse
  everywhere. Rosina looked rather wistfully across at Reggie. Again there was
  something in his expression which puzzled her.</p>

  <p>"I don't think that Lord Reginald liked my being here with you," she
  remarked to her companion, as they descended the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Is it any concern of his?" was the cool reply.</p>

  <p>"Naturally not&mdash;yet I wish he hadn't looked like that."</p>

  <p>They started on their homeward drive almost in silence. Rosina made an
  effort to be agreeable. Vaculos had shown her a great deal of consideration.
  It was not his fault that Madame had failed to keep her appointment. She
  concealed her discomfort. She talked cheerfully all the way, and, when they
  reached their destination and Vaculos had handed her over to the smiling lift
  boy, she held out her hand to him frankly.</p>

  <p>"I shall never forget my first evening in Paris, Mr. Vaculos," she said.
  "I have enjoyed every minute of it. Thank you a thousand times. And good
  night!"</p>

  <p>"It has made me very happy to be with you," he answered, holding her hand
  in his.</p>

  <p>"One thing more before you go, please," she begged. "Will you ask some one
  here to tell me where I can find Madame's room? I must see her before I go to
  bed."</p>

  <p>He turned and addressed the lift boy. They exchanged several rapid
  sentences. Vaculos turned back to Rosina.</p>

  <p>"The mystery is explained," he announced. "Madame returned home from
  dinner soon after we had left, with a violent headache. She instructed them
  to ring up the Abbaye, but this youth confesses that he rang up the
  Caf&eacute; de Paris. She has left orders that she is not to be disturbed
  to-night, but that she will come and see you when she has her coffee in the
  morning."</p>

  <p>"I am so sorry," Rosina said. "Thank you, Mr. Vaculos, and good night once
  more."</p>

  <p>Rosina ascended to the third floor. The same maid was waiting for her on
  the threshold of her apartment. She chattered away in French, Rosina replied
  in English. Then they both laughed at one another and their mutual
  misunderstanding. Marie pointed to the bathroom but Rosina shook her head.
  She held out her arms and suffered the gown which she had been wearing to
  slip shimmering to the floor, exchanged her satin shoes for bedroom slippers,
  and wrapped her own modest dressing gown around her. Then she pointed to the
  door. Marie protested. She turned down the bed. Mademoiselle must undress.
  The hour was late and mademoiselle must be fatigued with travelling. Rosina
  planted herself in an easy-chair and shook her head. She pointed again to the
  door. The maid, with many shrugs of the shoulders, at last took her
  departure. Rosina listened to the door closing behind her. Then she realised
  that she was alone. A queer sense of solitude oppressed her. There was not a
  sound to be heard, either in the streets outside or in the building. She
  walked all round the bathroom and bedroom, trying to find some notice or
  evidence as to her whereabouts. There was nothing at all. Yet she could not
  make up her mind to undress. She turned down the lights, except the shaded
  one by the bedside, and lingered in her armchair. The music of the evening
  was still in her brain. How wonderful it all might have been if only she
  could get rid of this hideous sense of depression!</p>

  <p>She made up her mind at last to go to bed. She had risen to her feet and
  was in the act of taking off her dressing gown, when she suddenly stood as
  though turned to stone. Some one had turned on a light in the sitting room.
  Through the chinks in the door she could see the illumination. She even
  fancied that she could hear a chair wheeled up to the fire. She searched
  eagerly for a lock or a bolt. Neither was there. Then she stood, for a
  moment, thinking. Anything, she decided, was better than this uncertainty.
  She opened the door softly. Vaculos, fully dressed except that he had changed
  his dress coat for a smoking jacket, was reclining in an easy-chair before
  the fire, a freshly lit cigarette between his lips, an evening paper in his
  hand. At the sound of the opening of the door, he lifted his head. She looked
  at him, horrified.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Vaculos," she exclaimed, "what are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>He laid down the paper and threw his cigarette into the fire.</p>

  <p>"My dear Rosina," he protested, "isn't that rather a strange question?
  These are my apartments. My bed-chamber is on the other side of this sitting
  room. I am sorry to have disturbed you but I thought that you had gone to
  bed."</p>

  <p>She stared at him, aghast. Yet, mingled with her fear, was a great
  bewilderment. He had never seemed more matter of fact. His only desire seemed
  to be to go on reading the paper.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she demanded. "I don't believe this is an hotel at
  all."</p>

  <p>"It is not," Vaculos replied equably. "This is my flat&mdash;rather a
  handsome one, in its way."</p>

  <p>"Your flat!"</p>

  <p>She began to shiver. Notwithstanding the man's coolness, waves of black
  and horrible thoughts were beginning to sweep in upon her.</p>

  <p>"Madame&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah, Madame," he interrupted. "There I think you are a little at fault.
  Madame sent you a letter last night to say that this little trip was
  postponed."</p>

  <p>"I never received it&mdash;I never had a line!" Rosina declared
  breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"The messenger may have made a mistake," Vaculos conceded. "I do not think
  that Madame will admit the possibility."</p>

  <p>"If the trip was postponed, then, why didn't you tell me so at the
  station?"</p>

  <p>"My dear child," he explained, "I really couldn't bear to see you
  disappointed. So long as you were there, I conceived the wonderful idea of
  bringing you along with me. The little fancy I built up in my mind, I
  confided to you on the way. We have entered upon the first phase of it."</p>

  <p>Rosina suddenly saw the ivory stud of an electric bell in the wall. She
  rushed towards it and pressed it. Vaculos made no effort to stop her.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he expostulated, "you are wasting your time. Those bells ring
  into an empty service room at night. If you desire your maid, I can fetch
  her, or if there is anything else you require, perhaps I can get it."</p>

  <p>"I want to leave this place!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"An awkward proceeding," he pointed out. "It is now half-past three in the
  morning. You speak no French, you have no idea where you want to go. I could
  not be so inhospitable as to let you leave my comfortable quarters.&mdash;You
  wouldn't care to sit down for a moment, would you?"</p>

  <p>"Not again&mdash;in this place," she faltered. "Let me out. I can find my
  way somewhere."</p>

  <p>"Rosina," he said calmly, "I beg that above all things you will avoid
  melodrama. There is, believe me, no occasion for it. You and I have been
  alone together once or twice before. Have I ever even touched your
  fingers?"</p>

  <p>"No," she admitted, finding some scanty comfort in his measured
  speech.</p>

  <p>"Believe me, it is no more my intention to intrude in any way upon you now
  that circumstances have made you my guest. My rooms lie on the other side of
  this sitting room. I should like to suggest that you went back to bed. We
  have a busy day to-morrow, and perhaps you will do me the honour to take your
  coffee here at ten o'clock."</p>

  <p>She was dumbfounded. His manner was so amazingly matter of fact that the
  more sinister possibilities of the situation seemed to belong, as he had
  suggested, to a different world.</p>

  <p>"Please help me to understand," she begged. "What is your object in trying
  to keep me here?"</p>

  <p>"To live through the fairy story I propounded to you in the train," he
  replied. "I wish you to be my guest for a week&mdash;a week on probation,
  forever if you choose. For that week, I, who know more about such things than
  most men, will devote my every effort to showing you all the refinements and
  wonders of life, lived in the most wonderful city of the world, without
  regard to money or any sort of material consideration. To-morrow, for
  instance, after we have paid a few visits in the Rue de la Paix, I shall take
  you to Versailles, where for as many hours as you choose you can feast on
  beauties which exist nowhere else. You will be tired after that, and you must
  rest. Then we go to the Opera&mdash;your gown is already ordered&mdash;and we
  dine late. Afterwards, we visit the caf&eacute;s and supper places, if you
  feel like it. Otherwise, we have an early night and prepare for the
  morrow."</p>

  <p>The indignation which tore at the very fibres of her being, found no
  adequate expression.</p>

  <p>"I will have nothing to do with your absurd scheme," she declared. "Let me
  go. I would rather walk about the streets than stay here."</p>

  <p>"That is very foolish," he remonstrated, "especially as it is raining. I
  am really giving you a wonderful opportunity, Rosina. You are a young woman
  with a very charming disposition, and you have been brought up with certain
  ideas as to what is right and wrong. You have strength of mind, narrowness of
  view, and an imagined affection for a worthless young man. Those
  characteristics, coupled with the fact that you have no idea what may lie in
  the world of which you know nothing, might well make you impregnable. I am
  giving you the opportunity of looking upon the other side of the picture
  without committing yourself, for to all that I have said yet, Rosina, I have
  this to add. It is not my intention during that week to intrude upon your
  privacy in the slightest degree. I do not ask, even, for the clasp of your
  fingers. You shall live the life of perfect self-respect and self-containment
  to which you are accustomed. If I fail, at the end of my experiment, to
  awaken in you desires for a different sort of existence to the miserable one
  which you have been living, if you have no kindlier feelings towards me at
  the end of that time than you have now, then my experiment will have been a
  failure. You can return to England, and I guarantee that Madame shall receive
  you as before and shall be in a position to offer to everybody concerned
  intelligent and convincing reasons for your absence."</p>

  <p>Rosina amazed herself and him. She leaned against the wall and began to
  cry. Sobs shook her frame. With the passing of imminent danger, a reaction
  seemed to have sapped her courage. She felt suddenly helpless, as though she
  must pass out of life through sheer inertness, sheer inability to breathe an
  atmosphere containing new and poisonous qualities. Vaculos placed a chair by
  her side and poured out a glass of water. He went back to his seat without
  touching her.</p>

  <p>"You disappoint me," he said calmly. "I have often thought that I have
  never known a young woman so splendidly free from all hysterics. You are in
  no danger. You can retire to your apartments when you choose. This
  communicating door is unfortunately without a bolt, but I offer you the word
  of honour of a man who has never broken it that you will remain undisturbed
  until your maid attends you in the morning. Why weep? Nothing terrible has
  happened to you. You are simply being given an opportunity of seeing both
  sides of the picture and making a deliberate choice.&mdash;I will relieve you
  of my presence."</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet. Suddenly, however, he stood still, listening to an
  unaccustomed sound. The lift had stopped at their floor. He heard the voice
  of the attendant. A moment later, the bell of his outside door was pressed by
  no uncertain finger.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b-14"
     name="b-14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Rosina stiffened into sudden attention. Vaculos stood with a
  heavy frown upon his forehead. The ringing was persistent. With a shrug of
  the shoulders, Vaculos moved towards the door. Almost as he did so, however,
  the ringing ceased. There was the sound of voices. A moment later,
  Fran&ccedil;ois, in <i>dishabille</i>, made an apologetic entrance.</p>

  <p>"I heard the bell ring from my room, sir," he said. "There is a gentleman
  outside who says his name is Lord Reginald Towers. He begs to be allowed a
  moment's conversation."</p>

  <p>"You can show him in," Vaculos directed.</p>

  <p>Reggie was already in the room. Rosina's expression was, in a way, a
  singular one. Her whole being seemed thrilled with gratitude, yet she stood
  there breathing quickly, wondering, gazing at the newcomer with an expression
  which he utterly failed to understand.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he began gravely, "I beg that you will neither of you
  misunderstand my visit. Miss Vonet is a friend of mine, but she has a perfect
  right to do as she chooses, and if I am an intruder here, there is nothing
  left but for me to offer my sincere apologies."</p>

  <p>"Yours is a late visit," Vaculos said calmly. "Perhaps you will explain
  its exact purport?"</p>

  <p>Reggie glanced at Rosina. She was obviously in a state of great
  excitement, but her tongue seemed paralysed.</p>

  <p>"It was the 'hotel' that did it," the young man continued. "Miss Vonet
  told me that she was staying at the 'Beaux Arts Hotel.' I got a telephone
  book and found there was no such place. Then I suddenly recollected that your
  rooms were in the Rue Beaux Art.&mdash;Look here," he went on, a little
  awkwardly, "I may be making a most infernal ass of myself, but I couldn't
  sleep&mdash;I just had to come round here. Is there anything wrong,
  Rosina?"</p>

  <p>She suddenly gripped his arm.</p>

  <p>"Take me away!" she begged.</p>

  <p>Reggie's manner became more decided. The lines about his mouth were
  grimmer.</p>

  <p>"It appears that I was right, then," he said, turning to Vaculos. "I shall
  have to trouble you for an explanation."</p>

  <p>Vaculos smiled cryptically.</p>

  <p>"Up to the present," he observed, "Miss Vonet and I have managed to
  conduct our affairs without melodrama. I beg that you will restrain yourself.
  Miss Vonet can tell you everything that there is to be told. She is also free
  to leave this flat whenever she chooses."</p>

  <p>"I choose now," Rosina sobbed.</p>

  <p>Vaculos shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"That," he admitted, "is a disappointment to me."</p>

  <p>There was a dangerous look in the younger man's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Rosina," he enjoined, "go and put on your things. You can explain
  afterwards how you got into this position. I want a word with Mr.
  Vaculos."</p>

  <p>Rosina, like a dumb thing, passed into the inner room. Reggie Towers
  waited until the door was closed; then he turned to the other man.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Vaculos," he said, "I know very little about you, and that little
  isn't good. Have you any explanation to offer as to Miss Vonet's presence
  here?"</p>

  <p>"By what right do you question me?" Vaculos enquired.</p>

  <p>"I am Miss Vonet's friend and compatriot," Reggie replied. "God knows what
  you are! I want you to understand this, though. If things are as they seem,
  for once in your life you are up against it. I'm going to give you a
  thrashing."</p>

  <p>Vaculos smiled. He took a cigarette from an open box and lit it.</p>

  <p>"No, I do not think that you will do that," he said.</p>

  <p>"I can assure you that it is my firm intention," Reggie declared. "I don't
  care a damn that you're an older man than I am, or a smaller. If you decoyed
  that girl here, you're going to suffer for it, whether any harm's been done
  or not."</p>

  <p>Vaculos stood quite at his ease on the hearth rug in front of his log
  fire.</p>

  <p>"I can see that you are chock-full of Drury Lane stuff," he remarked. "Got
  it right up to your throat, haven't you? However, I will be frank with
  you."</p>

  <p>"You had better," Reggie advised, moving a step nearer. "Be quick about
  it, too."</p>

  <p>Vaculos stared across at him.</p>

  <p>"You will oblige me by not coming any nearer," he ordered.</p>

  <p>Reggie laughed mirthlessly.</p>

  <p>"Unless you hurry up with that story, you'll find I shall be a great deal
  nearer before many seconds have passed," he threatened.</p>

  <p>"I shall tell you the story in my own time," Vaculos replied, "and you
  will stay just where you are. I am, as you remark, an older man, and perhaps
  without great physical strength. For that reason, and because it is a fancy
  of mine to walk the streets of Paris late at nights, I am always
  prepared."</p>

  <p>His hand slipped in and out of his waistcoat pocket. He held something
  which glittered softly under the electric light, something no larger than a
  silver pencil case.</p>

  <p>"This, I think," he went on, "is the smallest pistol ever made. I don't
  suppose it would really ever hurt any one, unless they were shot in the heart
  or the brain. I once killed an Arabian with it, but then he was only about a
  yard away. I am not a coward, Lord Reginald, but I object to the indignity of
  having my person touched. For that reason, I shall shoot you if I find it
  necessary to do so. I would rather suggest that you listen to my story."</p>

  <p>"Go on, then," was the impatient response.</p>

  <p>"I plead guilty to getting Miss Vonet here, believing it to be an hotel. I
  plead guilty to nothing else. Miss Vonet is a young woman for whom I have a
  profound admiration. I am used to feminine society and I appreciate it. You,
  I believe, resemble me in this respect. No one would ever associate Miss
  Vonet with any of the small indiscretions of life. She has at once too much
  character and too much self-respect for anything of the sort."</p>

  <p>"Then what the devil did you inveigle her here for?" Reggie demanded.</p>

  <p>"To give her an opportunity," Vaculos replied, "of seeing both sides of
  the picture of life. Miss Vonet will tell you that I have not said a word to
  her which could be considered unbecoming or in bad taste. I have not even
  attempted to touch her fingers. I should not have done so during her stay
  here. She herself knows that. Ask her, if you do not believe me."</p>

  <p>"Then what the mischief does it all mean?" the young man demanded.</p>

  <p>"It means that I am a man of taste and refinement," Vaculos explained, a
  little wearily. "The seducer belongs to another world. I know nothing of him
  or of his arts. I desired to show Miss Vonet exactly what might be her life
  if she chose to throw in her lot with mine. For that reason, I meant to keep
  her here for a week, and I think that, if she had got over the shock of
  finding herself alone with me, she would probably have remained my guest for
  that period. She ran no risk. If I kept her here by guile, I kept her here
  only as an honoured guest, to give me an opportunity of pleading my cause and
  explaining the situation. You have arrived before she has been able to
  establish her sense of proportion. You find her in a state of hysterical
  revulsion before her brain has begun to work. It is my bad fortune, perhaps
  it is hers. I should have introduced her to artists, men of letters and
  musicians. I should have had her educated until she understood the rarer
  pleasures of life. Incidentally, I should have made her rich, given her an
  established position, and probably ended by making her my wife. You have
  spoilt my scheme."</p>

  <p>The inner door opened. Rosina stood there, dressed in the clothes in which
  she had arrived, and carrying her green canvas suitcase. Reggie turned
  towards her.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Rosina," he said, "I can't get at this fellow. He's talking
  over my head. Will you tell me this? Has he taken any advantage of his
  position here&mdash;offered you any unwelcome attentions, or that sort of
  thing&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>Rosina shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No!" she declared steadily. "I do not think that I had anything to fear
  from Mr. Vaculos, unless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Unless what?" Reggie demanded.</p>

  <p>"Unless what?" Vaculos echoed, looking at her steadfastly.</p>

  <p>"Unless I myself had changed," Rosina faltered.</p>

  <p>Reggie opened the door.</p>

  <p>"I'm not satisfied," he said, "but we'll leave it at that. Come along,
  Rosina."</p>

  <p>Rosina looked across at Vaculos. He had turned his back upon them. Reggie
  took her bag and she followed him out to the lift. They descended in silence.
  He handed her into his car.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I have nothing better to offer than my rooms," he said
  regretfully. "I can get a shakedown at the Embassy. Awkward sort of time, you
  know, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"What time is the first train back to London?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Seven o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Please take me to the station," she begged. "I have a fancy to get there
  quickly. I don't want to go anywhere else. Would it bother you very
  much?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit," he assured her, "but the Gare du Nord is a jolly
  uncomfortable place."</p>

  <p>"That won't matter," she answered.</p>

  <p>He directed the chauffeur and they drove through the silent streets,
  northwards. There was a pale light everywhere upon the houses; the pavements
  were glittering with rain.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't wait with me," Rosina enjoined, as they approached their
  destination.</p>

  <p>"Don't be an idiot," he replied. "I'm not going to leave you alone
  here."</p>

  <p>She gripped his arm.</p>

  <p>"I can't talk much."</p>

  <p>"No need. We shall be there in a minute or two now."</p>

  <p>They found a caf&eacute; open, close to the station, and he made her drink
  some hot coffee. Then they paced the dreary platform together for what seemed
  to be an interminable time. Finally the train backed in. He found her a place
  at once. She sank back amongst the cushions and gave a little exclamation of
  relief. He asked her one last question, a few minutes before the horn
  sounded.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Rosina," he said, "tell me the honest truth. Did that brute
  frighten you at all? You seem terrified still. It seems to me that he must
  have done something more than just keep you there."</p>

  <p>She shook her head. She was looking very pale and drawn, almost as though
  she were recovering from an illness. Her eyes seemed to have become
  unnaturally large.</p>

  <p>"He did not even touch me, Reggie," she answered. "I knew that I was quite
  safe from that. It was my soul he hurt. He made me listen. I shall get over
  it very soon. Just now I feel as though the other part of me&mdash;not my
  body at all&mdash;were filled with poisons."</p>

  <p>The horn sounded. He was forced to step back. His parting recollection of
  Rosina was of her wan face pressed against the window&mdash;a very pitiful
  attempt at a smile.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b-15"
     name="b-15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Rosina never quite understood the instinct&mdash;it amounted
  almost to an obsession&mdash;which sent her into hiding immediately on her
  arrival in London. She reached her rooms about four o'clock, feverishly
  collected her few belongings, and drove away in a taxi before Violet's
  return. She found a single bedroom in the top story of a grimy house at the
  back of Russell Square, established herself and her belongings there, and
  went straight to bed. She awoke in the morning refreshed, but still with the
  sense of carrying an almost intolerable burden of memories. She did her best,
  however, to thrust these into the background. Once more she was confronted
  with the stern necessity of earning a living. She counted her money&mdash;she
  had altogether five pounds, thirteen shillings. Then for the first time she
  opened the packet which Miss McAlister had slipped into her hand, and found
  that it contained two five-pound notes. She added them gratefully to her
  little stock, bought a <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, and started out with rather
  weary footsteps on the quest to which she was now no stranger. After five
  hours of disappointments, she climbed the stairs of her vacated rooms in
  Endell Street and pushed open the door of the tiny sitting room. Violet, who
  was bending over the stove with a teapot in her hand, turned around with a
  little exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Rosina!" she cried. "Goodness gracious, what a shock you gave me! What on
  earth has happened to you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing much," Rosina answered. "Give me some tea, there's a dear."</p>

  <p>"Of course! There's some toast, too. Fancy your turning up like this
  without a word! Why, the old lady downstairs said that you swept in yesterday
  afternoon, packed your things in five minutes, caught up your American
  letter, and ran away like a mad thing. What does it all mean?"</p>

  <p>Rosina ate toast and sipped her tea contentedly.</p>

  <p>"It means, I suppose, that I am an idiot, Violet," she confessed, "but
  there it is. Madame never came to Paris&mdash;never meant to go. I was left
  to travel over alone with Mr. Vaculos, and when I got there&mdash;well,
  things weren't very pleasant."</p>

  <p>Violet sat down on the hearth rug, clasping her knees with her hands.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about it, dear?" she begged. "Madame is in a terrible state
  because you're back here and haven't been to the shop."</p>

  <p>"I shall never go back to the shop," Rosina declared. "I never want to see
  Madame again, or any of them. Last night, Violet, I felt I didn't even want
  to see you. That is why I ran away. I have a little room of my own, quite
  close to here."</p>

  <p>"Cat!" Violet exclaimed. "But tell me all about it."</p>

  <p>"There isn't much to tell," Rosina acknowledged. "I suppose, according to
  his lights, Mr. Vaculos behaved very well, and that, from his point of view,
  I behaved like a hysterical fool. He took me out to supper, showed me a note
  in Madame's hand-writing, saying that she would be there, and afterwards,
  when we got back, I found that I was in his flat instead of at an hotel."</p>

  <p>"A most gorgeous place, every one declares," Violet said. "Victor told me
  all about it once, and Maud Stevenson&mdash;she left before you
  came&mdash;stayed there."</p>

  <p>"It was very beautiful," Rosina admitted, "but I did not wish to stay
  there. Reggie Towers&mdash;the young man you have seen me with once or
  twice&mdash;was at the restaurant where we went for supper, and came round
  afterwards to be sure that I was all right. I preferred to leave with him,
  and I came home by the seven o'clock train from Paris yesterday morning."</p>

  <p>Violet looked wonderingly across at her companion.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you're not the strangest girl, Rosina!" she declared. "However
  do you expect to get through life?"</p>

  <p>"My own way or not at all," Rosina answered.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Vaculos is a millionaire," Violet persisted. "He could have given you
  the most wonderful time in Paris. With a little management, you could have
  done what you liked with him."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps so," Rosina replied. "The idea did not appeal to me, so here I
  am. You think I'm a little fool, of course. Perhaps you're right."</p>

  <p>"What have you been doing all day?"</p>

  <p>"Trying to find a job."</p>

  <p>"But you'll have to come back to the shop," Violet insisted. "Madame will
  be furious if you don't. She knows there's something wrong, because she's had
  a telegram from Mr. Vaculos. She told me to tell you, if I found you here,
  that she was expecting you back to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>"I shall never return," Rosina replied, calmly helping herself to the last
  piece of toast.</p>

  <p>"But why?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot exactly tell you. The whole atmosphere of the place has suddenly
  become hateful to me. Besides, it was partly Madame's fault. It is a hateful
  thing to say, but she understood exactly what was happening."</p>

  <p>"Well, you know best," Violet observed. "I have lived in the world a
  little longer than you, and I tell you honestly, my child, that, even if you
  mean to live like an angel for the rest of your life, you would do better to
  treat this as a joke. There isn't a girl in the place who wasn't longing to
  be in your shoes."</p>

  <p>"It has been no joke to me," Rosina declared. "I don't pretend to be the
  least bit better than you other girls. I dare say you've all got better stuff
  in you than I have. But in just one way we're entirely different. We won't
  discuss that."</p>

  <p>"I believe that Madame would double your salary rather than not have you
  go back," Violet confided. "Mr. Vaculos will be furious."</p>

  <p>"Nothing," Rosina insisted, "will ever induce me to set foot in the place
  again."</p>

  <p>"And what about me?" Violet asked, a little ruefully.</p>

  <p>Rosina leaned down and put her arm around her friend's neck.</p>

  <p>"Violet dear, don't be angry with me," she begged. "Don't think I'm
  putting on airs, or trying to make myself out better than any one else, but
  I've had a strange sort of shock inside. I'll talk better about it later on.
  I feel years older. I've lost my taste for all the things you and I used to
  rather hanker after&mdash;beautiful clothes, and the theatres, and smart
  restaurants. I want to bury myself somewhere. I shall get over it. Perhaps
  I'll come back to you later on, if you'll have me. I'm going to try typing
  again, if I can get a job."</p>

  <p>"Have you any money, old thing?" Violet asked.</p>

  <p>"Heaps," Rosina answered,&mdash;"enough to keep me going for a long time.
  Better let me have the book and we'll settle up here. I want to pay my share
  of the sitting room for as long as you think fair, and for my bedroom, of
  course, until the end of next week."</p>

  <p>Violet made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"You don't need to worry about that," she said. "There's a girl in the
  showrooms who'll come along here at once, if I want her. She's rather a dear,
  but giddy, I'm afraid. If you pay for your bedroom till Saturday, and half
  the sitting room, that will be all you need do."</p>

  <p>They deliberated over the book, and arrived at a settlement in a
  light-hearted fashion.</p>

  <p>"Here's my address," Rosina confided, scribbling it down on a piece of
  paper,&mdash;"Number 10, Mandeville Street. It's just behind the
  Museum&mdash;a horrible little room, but it will do for the present, until I
  can pull myself together. You'll send any letters on, won't you? But don't
  give it away&mdash;promise that, there's a dear, Violet. I couldn't hide from
  you, but I don't want another soul to know where I am."</p>

  <p>"I won't breathe a word," Violet assured her. "You'll have trouble with
  Madame, though."</p>

  <p>"Nothing that she could say would make any difference," Rosina declared.
  "I shall never set foot in the shop again. And as for Madame herself, I have
  the most horrible feeling when I think of her."</p>

  <p>"You'll come round soon and let me know how you're getting on?" Violet
  begged.</p>

  <p>"Honour bright," Rosina promised. "I'll come about tea-time&mdash;I like
  the way you make toast."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Rosina invested a considerable portion of her capital in a small
  typewriter and obtained several commissions from the agency where she had
  enrolled her name. She had three letters from Madame, the first begging her
  to return and offering her an increased salary; the second almost tearful in
  its entreaties; the third still appealing but with an undernote of anger.
  Rosina took no notice of any of them. Another letter, which interested her
  more, came from a firm of solicitors in Lincoln's Inn, inviting her to call.
  She made her way there on the morning of its receipt and was introduced at
  once into the presence of Mr. Houghton, the principal of the firm. He
  received her courteously and begged her to be seated.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't sure whether you had some typing to give me," Rosina explained.
  "I have brought my machine with me."</p>

  <p>Mr. Houghton waved it away.</p>

  <p>"Our business with you is of a different nature," he said. "We have
  received instructions from a very valued client who has been obliged to leave
  England for a short time, to pay you weekly the sum of four pounds."</p>

  <p>"To pay me?" Rosina exclaimed. "What for?"</p>

  <p>"There are no conditions," Mr. Houghton replied. "The donor is a
  well-wisher of yours, and he desires for the present to remain anonymous. We
  have simply to pay you four pounds on any day of the week you may select, and
  obtain your receipt."</p>

  <p>Rosina sat quite still for a moment. The first breath of summer had seemed
  to be in the air as she had walked through the streets that morning. For a
  moment she fancied herself at the sea, or at a cottage in the country,
  resting, away from these interminable grey streets, this continual routine of
  seeking work. Four pounds a week! And all the time, underneath, that hateful
  fear!</p>

  <p>"I must know from whom this money comes?" she decided at last.</p>

  <p>The lawyer shook his head.</p>

  <p>"That is contrary to our express instructions," he said.</p>

  <p>Rosina smiled at him. Her smile was still a wonderful thing.</p>

  <p>"You must please just give me a hint," she begged. "There is one person
  from whom I would accept nothing. If I tell you his name&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"This is most unprofessional, Miss Vonet," Mr. Houghton interrupted. "My
  instructions are absolute. I can tell you nothing, negatively or positively,
  except that there are four pounds a week here for you at any time you choose
  to come and claim them."</p>

  <p>"If the money were from Mr. Vaculos," she explained, "I would tear the
  notes into pieces before I touched them."</p>

  <p>"So far as I am concerned, I have nothing more to say," the lawyer
  announced, a little stiffly. "My clerk, Mr. Bonham, whom you will always find
  in the office outside, will pay you the money at any time you choose to apply
  for it."</p>

  <p>"You won't tell me whether it is from Mr. Vaculos or not?" she pleaded. "I
  want the money so badly, but I'm afraid it must be from him."</p>

  <p>The lawyer looked at her and rang the bell. A small boy showed her
  out.</p>

  <p>"Did you wish to speak to Mr. Bonham, miss?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>She hesitated in the stone-flagged passage. Her earnings for the last week
  had been twenty-four shillings, and her capital had dwindled to a very low
  ebb. She stamped her foot, however, at the surprised boy.</p>

  <p>"No!" she answered, and walked out of the place.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b-16"
     name="b-16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. Vaculos, newly landed from the giant Cunarder in New
  York, was lunching with Miss Alma Gawthorne at the Ritz-Carlton. They had not
  met for many months, and they had plenty to say to each other.</p>

  <p>"You are looking tired, Stephen," the young lady remarked sympathetically.
  "Did you have a bad voyage?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The voyage was well enough," he said. "I could not sleep. I think I am a
  little tired of the old world. I was probably missing you all the time."</p>

  <p>She threw back her head and laughed.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you send for me? I have never yet refused an invitation to
  Paris. And now it is too late. I am booked to work&mdash;work hard, too."</p>

  <p>"Tell me about the new play?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"It is just wonderful," she declared. "When I first heard it read, I
  thought that it was a little above the heads of a New York audience. The
  second time, I began to catch on. The third time, I was convinced that it was
  really the cleverest piece of work I had ever come across. I think it's going
  to be the biggest success we've ever had, Stephen. London will go crazy over
  it. I sha'n't tell you a thing about it," she went on, "because we're going
  right down-town to a rehearsal from here."</p>

  <p>"What's the author's name?" Vaculos enquired.</p>

  <p>"He's quite unknown," she replied,&mdash;"an English boy whom Duggie Erwen
  brought out with him from London, and who has been acting as a sort of
  secretary to him ever since. He's written one or two rather high-brow
  stories, but I haven't come across any of them. And they say that he has a
  novel on the press. This is his first piece of serious work for the stage. I
  am quite sure that I have never had such a part in my life."</p>

  <p>"And the young man's name?"</p>

  <p>"Philip Garth. He is rather a dear, but he keeps his head well up in the
  clouds. They say he's engaged to a girl in London, and saving all his money
  to go back and marry her. He doesn't come round with the crowd, anyhow."</p>

  <p>"You would be very disappointed not to play this part?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Stephen, I should be broken-hearted," the young lady declared.
  "Why do you suggest such a thing? We have the firm offer of the play.
  Everything is settled, indeed, except for your signature of the contract.
  When you have seen the rehearsal this afternoon, I promise you you'll be
  calling for pen and ink."</p>

  <p>"Shall I?" Vaculos muttered. "Well, we shall see. I have peculiar tastes
  sometimes, you know. By the by, how is Jimmy? And are the Bedales still going
  strong? I saw Anna in Paris&mdash;without her husband."</p>

  <p>Luncheon was concluded amidst a mutual interchange of gossip. Afterwards,
  they drove down to the theatre. Miss Gawthorne endeavoured to revert to the
  subject of the play, but her companion was not inclined to discuss it.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to sit and listen to it for the next few hours," he pointed
  out. "Let me come to it fresh. If I like it, I shall say so. If I don't, I
  shall also say so."</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake, don't suggest such a possibility!" she exclaimed.
  "Why, the whole company would be broken-hearted! They're all practically
  engaged, and we're talking about London already. Jimmy is frightfully keen on
  your sending a company over from here. However, he'll talk to you."</p>

  <p>"Does this Mr. Garth know who is your backer, Alma, and the owner of the
  theatre?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't know your name," she replied. "I have always been careful to
  keep that secret. Of course, after this afternoon, I suppose he will have to
  know."</p>

  <p>They reached the theatre&mdash;one of Vaculos's most costly possessions.
  The latter lingered for a few minutes upon the stage, shook hands with the
  principals, and finally was introduced to Philip. He studied the young man
  intently.</p>

  <p>"We met in London once, I think," he said, "although we were never
  introduced. I came to a party given by Douglas Erwen at the Savoy. You were
  with a young lady who had a small part in his play."</p>

  <p>"I remember the party," Philip remarked, with a little grimace. "I'm
  afraid I behaved rather badly at it. As you say, though, I don't think we
  met. I left rather early."</p>

  <p>Vaculos nodded.</p>

  <p>"I am going to listen to the play," he said. "I shall take a seat back in
  the stalls. Please ignore me as much as possible, all of you. I want to be
  the disinterested spectator."</p>

  <p>The producer knocked with his cane upon the little reading desk. The
  business of the afternoon commenced.</p>

  <p>At the end of the first act, Alma Gawthorne made her way into the
  auditorium and sat by the side of Vaculos.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she asked confidently.</p>

  <p>"I have no opinion at present," he replied. "You must wait until the end
  of the play."</p>

  <p>He began to talk about something else. Presently she left him and went
  back to the stage. At the end of the next act, he signalled to her not to
  come and sat there quite alone, his pale face unnaturally white in the gloom
  of the auditorium. When it was all over, he rose slowly to his feet, walked
  down the centre aisle and across the baize gangway which had been let down on
  to the stage. They stood in a little group awaiting his arrival&mdash;Philip,
  confident and happy, Jimmy Dugdale, the producer and Miss Gawthorne's
  dramatic adviser, no less assured. Every one looked upon the decision as
  inevitable. There was something about Vaculos's appearance, however, as he
  came amongst them, which to Alma, who knew him better than any of the others,
  seemed a little ominous. He had grown older, she thought, as he came to a
  standstill. There were hollows under his unpleasant-looking eyes which made
  them seem unduly protuberant. He carried himself without briskness. He had
  the air almost of a tired man.</p>

  <p>"Well?" Jimmy enquired confidently. "That's the real stuff, isn't it,
  guv'nor?"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to disappoint you all," was the cold reply. "The play does not
  please me in the least. I think you have all been led away by a slight
  unusualness of theme. I have come straight from the French theatres, so
  perhaps I am a little over-critical."</p>

  <p>"Say, you're not going to jump it?" Jimmy Dugdale exclaimed,
  horror-stricken.</p>

  <p>"That is precisely what I am going to do," Vaculos acquiesced. "The play
  does not please me, and I will not have it produced at my theatre. I have
  acquired the sole rights of two of Guitry's last productions. I shall re-pen
  the theatre with one of them. If you are coming along, Alma, we will take a
  turn in the park before dinner."</p>

  <p>The little company of people was stricken almost dumb with amazement.
  Philip was standing as though he scarcely understood, nervously fingering the
  manuscript.</p>

  <p>"Say, what about the contracts?" Jimmy Dugdale demanded.</p>

  <p>"I shall not sign them, naturally," Vaculos declared. "I will undertake,
  however, to engage the whole of the artistes you had collected for this
  production, for the play which I intend to produce, so that none of them will
  be the losers. As regards the author," he added, his eyes resting for a
  moment upon Philip,&mdash;"well, I am sorry for your disappointment, Mr.
  Garth. I do not think your play would suit my audiences. You may have better
  fortune with it elsewhere."</p>

  <p>He turned away, pausing for a moment for Alma to precede him. She turned,
  however, to Philip and held out her hand.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Garth," she said, "I just want to tell you how sorry I am that Mr.
  Vaculos feels this way about your play. I am going to tell you right here,
  before him, that I think he's made a mistake. Your play is splendid. Some day
  or other you'll get some one to produce it&mdash;I'm dead sure of that."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand, which Philip found himself mechanically clasping.
  Then she departed with Vaculos, who had stood by with immovable face. They
  disappeared through the wings. Every one exchanged glances of consternation.
  The actual members of the company, however, were recovering from their first
  dismay. The fact that they had all been promised parts in another production
  was a great consolation.</p>

  <p>"Say, that's hard luck, old chap!" Jimmy Dugdale exclaimed
  compassionately. "Garth, old man, I can't say how sorry I am. Let's get along
  to the club and talk this over."</p>

  <p>Philip's back had broadened with the years. He even summoned courage
  enough to smile.</p>

  <p>"It is a disappointment," he admitted. "I certainly did not think that any
  one could take a positive dislike to the play."</p>

  <p>"It's the queerest thing I've ever known," Dugdale continued, as the two
  men passed out into the street. "We submit everything for the old man's
  approval, of course&mdash;he owns the theatre and runs the show&mdash;but
  it's the first time in seven years I have ever known him to upset anything
  we've gone for. And Miss Gawthorne, too&mdash;crazy about the part! It gets
  my goat to think of it."</p>

  <p>"It can't be helped," Philip said, stopping upon the causeway. "I'm not
  coming round to the club, Jimmy. I may be along for dinner, but I want to get
  back to my rooms and think this out."</p>

  <p>"That's all right, old man," Jimmy declared. "I only wish I could help
  you. You know what New York theatres are. I shouldn't have said there had
  been a single one as free as we have been to make our choice of the stuff.
  I'll think it over by dinner time. May be able to suggest something."</p>

  <p>Philip found his way to the subway and to Douglas Erwen's little flat on
  the top storey of a tall building in Fifty-seventh Street. He had occupied a
  small room on the same floor, opposite his friend's more extensive suite,
  since the day of his arrival in the States, but Erwen, who was cruising in
  the South Sea Islands, had insisted upon lending him his apartments during
  his absence. He let himself in, locked the door, took up a theatrical
  directory and made out a careful list of the managers whom he had not yet
  approached. Then he took a clean copy of the play from his drawer, and wrote
  in it the corrections and suggestions which here and there disfigured the
  soiled pages of the original copy. This work occupied him for an hour at
  least. Then, for the first time, he permitted himself to think of his
  disappointment. It might mean not seeing Rosina for another six
  months&mdash;perhaps a year. He looked across the medley of buildings towards
  the hills on the other side of the Hudson. For a moment, a touch of the old
  weakness came back. He realised the fact which he had been sedulously
  denying&mdash;that he was hideously and pitifully homesick, that he longed
  more than anything else in the world for a sight of her, for the sound of her
  laugh, the touch of her fingers. It was a knockdown blow, this&mdash;the
  second of his life. His thoughts went back to the evening when he had torn
  open that little packet and beheld the visible prostitution of his first
  efforts,&mdash;the hideous-looking, cheap magazine, the cut sentences, the
  ludicrous illustrations. The very recollection gave him strength. He was far
  better able to stand this second blow. Already he was mounting. One or two of
  the best magazines in the States had published his stories. There was the
  novel, his great hope, soon to appear; a second begun, already intriguing
  him, already providing him with one of those select chambers of thought into
  which he could pass when time and occasion served. This fellow
  Vaculos&mdash;was it ignorance, or could it be in any way personal dislike?
  He was reputed to be a good judge of a play, something of an artist and a
  literary man himself. But a decision so speedily taken, so unhesitatingly
  spoken, carried with it suggestions of bias. The matter lent itself to no
  solution, however. With a little shrug of the shoulders he put it on one
  side. His play had been turned down&mdash;that was all that mattered.</p>

  <p>At dinner time that night, Jimmy Dugdale, his very good friend since the
  days when Erwen had first introduced him into the bohemian society of New
  York, helped him to formulate a plan of campaign amongst the likely
  theatrical managers in New York. Afterwards, Philip visited Jane McAlister,
  who sent her love to Rosina, was amazed to hear that Vaculos had turned down
  the play, and promised to do her best in other directions. The days went by,
  however, and nothing happened. Meanwhile, he went steadily on with his novel,
  tried his best to forget his disappointment, and wrote cheerfully to Rosina.
  One morning came a telephone message from Jane McAlister. He was to call, if
  possible, some time during the day. In half an hour he presented himself at
  her office in Fifth Avenue. She took off her horn-rimmed spectacles and
  motioned him to a chair.</p>

  <p>"Philip Garth," she announced, "I've got the best man in New York
  screaming about your play. Walter Addison was here yesterday himself. He told
  me that he hadn't read anything for five years that he'd like to produce so
  much."</p>

  <p>"Walter Addison!" Philip exclaimed. "Why, there isn't a better man in the
  world! I thought of him many a time when I was writing it."</p>

  <p>"This is where we're up against it, though," Miss McAlister continued.
  "Wallie lost a hundred thousand dollars over that Rostand production. He
  hasn't got a cent to his name, and, though he's got an option on the Grand,
  the best theatre in New York for your play, he hasn't the money to clinch it.
  You know, as a rule, Wallie won't be backed. He hates it. But beggars can't
  be choosers. He wants to produce your play, but he can't do it without the
  dollars. Have you any wealthy friends? Can you suggest any one who might go
  into a syndicate?"</p>

  <p>"Not a soul," Philip acknowledged frankly. "The friends I've made over on
  this side are just about as hard up as I am."</p>

  <p>Jane McAlister sighed.</p>

  <p>"That's hard luck," she declared. "I've rung up a couple of men myself who
  sometimes like to come into a theatrical speculation, but one's away in
  Bermuda, and the other only cares about musical comedy. Likes a cheap call on
  the girls for supper parties, and that sort of stuff. The worst of it is,
  Addison's option on the Grand Theatre is up before long, and I heard a rumour
  yesterday that Vaculos was after it."</p>

  <p>"The man who turned me down," Philip remarked.</p>

  <p>Miss McAlister nodded.</p>

  <p>"You never ran up against him in any way, did you?" she asked
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"Not that I know of."</p>

  <p>"It's a queer business," she ruminated. "Wallie asked me about it. It
  seems he spoke of the play enthusiastically, the night before last at the
  club, in front of Vaculos, not having heard that it was through him that Alma
  Gawthorne had to give it up. Said he couldn't understand how, if Alma once
  got her fingers on it, she let any one else have a show. Next thing is that
  we hear that Vaculos is enquiring about the lease of the Grand, knowing that
  Wallie's option is almost up. If you put two and two together, Mr. Philip
  Garth, it rather looks as though this man Vaculos had it up against you."</p>

  <p>"To the best of my belief," Philip declared, "I had never spoken to him in
  my life before we met on the stage at the theatre."</p>

  <p>"It's hard luck," Jane McAlister repeated. "I'll try one or two other of
  my friends, but money's scarce just now. I'll fix it up for you if I can, for
  that dear little girl's sake. Give her my love, and run along now."</p>

  <p>Philip took his leave, puzzled yet not altogether disheartened. It was
  encouraging, at any rate, that the most finished actor in America liked the
  play and wanted to produce it. He made his way back to his rooms and planned
  out a great day's work. He had his lunch sent up from the restaurant on the
  ground floor of the building and worked until he suddenly found his eyes
  aching and the lights flashing out from the tall buildings and in the street
  below. There was a knock at the door. His invitation to enter was entirely
  perfunctory. He looked at the tall figure who stood upon the threshold,
  without in the least recognising him.</p>

  <p>"I can't see who you are," he said, "but come in."</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet and turned on the electric light. Then he gave a
  little exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Benjamin!" he almost shouted.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b-17"
     name="b-17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">On the whole, perhaps it was the greatest surprise of
  Philip's life. Rosina had written almost pathetically of Benjamin Stone,
  their old tyrant, his money gone, working as night watchman at Matthew's
  warehouse for three pounds a week. And here, dressed as he had never seen him
  before, in the well-cut clothes of a travelled Englishman, clean-shaven, with
  his unkempt locks trimmed, and with his everlasting frown for the moment, at
  any rate, banished, was the man whom he himself had been wondering whether it
  might not be possible in some small way to assist.</p>

  <p>"Philip, my lad, I am glad to see you," the newcomer declared.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad to see you, Uncle Benjamin," Philip replied, "but you've taken
  my breath away. Did Rosina know you were coming?"</p>

  <p>A shadow passed across Benjamin Stone's face.</p>

  <p>"I have seen nothing of Rosina for some time," he admitted regretfully.
  "We met in Regent Street, many months ago. She was kindly and she seemed
  well, but she was busy fashioning her own life. I offered her a home&mdash;a
  poor one, perhaps&mdash;but she preferred her freedom."</p>

  <p>Philip smiled.</p>

  <p>"Rosina will have all the freedom and all the adventure she wants,
  presently," he said. "I am doing a little better out here, and, apart from
  the love of my work, I work for one purpose only, and that is to go back and
  marry her."</p>

  <p>"That is very good news," Benjamin Stone declared. "It's the best news
  I've heard for some time."</p>

  <p>"And Matthew?"</p>

  <p>"He is a great man in the city. He has made his mistakes but I think he
  has learnt his lesson. He will soon be a wealthy man. It is what he desires
  most in life."</p>

  <p>"Matthew's ambitions were always tolerably concrete," Philip remarked.
  "And now about yourself, Uncle Benjamin? What has brought you out here?"</p>

  <p>"Above all," the latter confessed, with a touch of his old manner, "to ask
  your pardon, my lad."</p>

  <p>"My pardon?" Philip repeated wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"For a wrong done to you in my thoughts, a wrong that has kept me stern
  and aloof when I might have been helpful. You remember the night before you
  left Norchester?"</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"You went down to the factory alone."</p>

  <p>"Quite true. I had a few things down there I wanted to collect."</p>

  <p>"Fifty pounds was stolen from the cash box that night," Benjamin Stone
  declared,&mdash;"fifty pounds in Treasury notes. I discovered it that
  selfsame night, for I, too, was in the building. I accounted you the
  thief."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" Philip exclaimed. "I've been rather a rotter, uncle, but I
  never stole a penny of any one's money in my life."</p>

  <p>"I believe you, my boy," Benjamin Stone assured him solemnly. "As it
  happens, the real thief has now confessed. I was shocked when I realised the
  wrong I had done you. I am here to tell you that I'm sorry. Now that's over
  and done with. You'll take dinner with me, I trust? We will go to my
  hotel."</p>

  <p>"Rather!" Philip assented cordially. "Where are you staying?"</p>

  <p>"The Waldorf-Astoria. I just went where the others went who were on the
  steamer. It's a noisy place but clean."</p>

  <p>Philip was staggered.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you'll find it rather expensive," he remarked, as he reached
  for his hat.</p>

  <p>"I must make the best of it," Benjamin Stone sighed. "It is not for long,
  anyway."</p>

  <p>Philip discovered new and amazing qualities of sympathy in his host that
  evening. He found himself, before dinner was over&mdash;a dinner offered
  without any regard to that economy which had been Benjamin Stone's
  predominant impulse&mdash;talking freely of himself, of his plans and
  disappointments. At the mention of the name of Vaculos, the old frown made
  its reappearance on his listener's forehead. He stopped his late ward
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Vaculos, did you say? It's the name of the man they spoke to me about at
  the dressmaker's where Rosina was employed."</p>

  <p>"Tell me about that?" Philip begged.</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone deliberated for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I lost track of Rosina," he said, "after our tea together that day, and I
  had a fancy for finding her, to discover if perhaps she needed a trifle of
  help. I went to the shop where she had been employed&mdash;a terribly
  fashionable place, Philip. They told me that she had left. Then a dark,
  foreign-looking woman came up and spoke to me. She said she had no idea where
  Rosina was, and she told me that Rosina had treated her very badly through
  leaving, and got her into trouble. I said I was sorry, and I was for taking
  my leave but the woman wouldn't let me go. She told me that
  Rosina&mdash;don't take this seriously, my lad, for from the moment she
  opened her mouth I knew that the woman was a Papist and a liar&mdash;had gone
  without permission to Paris with a Mr. Vaculos, and had never returned to the
  shop."</p>

  <p>"So that was the man!" Philip muttered.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, I could find no trace of her until just before I was sailing,"
  Benjamin Stone continued. "I thought of going to see her, then I decided to
  wait until I got back. I left some money with a lawyer, to be paid her
  weekly, so she'll be in no manner of want, whatever may have happened."</p>

  <p>"But the last time I heard anything about you," Philip protested, "Rosina
  told me that you were night watchman at a warehouse and earning three pounds
  a week&mdash;that you had lost all your money and were practically
  destitute."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone smiled.</p>

  <p>"That was a slight exaggeration," he confessed. "I am not exactly
  destitute&mdash;I am not even poor."</p>

  <p>"I am delighted to hear it!" Philip exclaimed. "And as for Rosina, don't
  you worry any more than I do. I mistrusted her once, and I've felt the shame
  of it ever since. I shall never mistrust her again. She's of finer clay than
  we others. She could walk through hell and come out unsinged."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone's face suddenly cleared. He leaned across and patted his
  companion on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"That is well-spoken, lad," he declared, "well-spoken indeed. Now I'd like
  you to take me to one of these roof gardens they talk about. It makes one
  anxious to get out of doors here to see what all the noise is about."</p>

  <p>"You'll never discover that," Philip assured him, noticing with some
  surprise the indifference with which his companion signed the bill, and the
  munificence of his tip. "And with regard to the roof garden, you
  understand&mdash;it's a sort of music-hall performance?"</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone smiled.</p>

  <p>"I have made a few changes in my outlook upon life during the last twelve
  months, Philip," he said. "They tell me that hundreds of thousands of people
  visit these places. I am certainly no better than the rest, so I will go with
  them."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Miss Jane McAlister gazed with some curiosity at her first visitor on the
  following morning. The name of Benjamin Stone conveyed nothing to her. The
  somewhat austere, fine-looking Englishman who was presently ushered in was a
  complete stranger.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Benjamin Stone?" she enquired, looking at him over her horn-rimmed
  spectacles. "What can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>"I have come to see you," Benjamin Stone replied, "with reference to a
  play written by a young friend of mine&mdash;Philip Garth."</p>

  <p>Jane McAlister was at once interested.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," she invited. "I am a busy woman, but I've time enough to talk
  about that play."</p>

  <p>"I understand," her visitor continued, "that it was to have been produced
  at one of the principal theatres here, but for the intervention of a Mr.
  Vaculos?"</p>

  <p>"Sure!" Miss McAlister assented. "He served the boy a rotten trick and we
  none of us know why. The play is better than anything that's been on the
  stage here for the last two years."</p>

  <p>"And I also understand," Benjamin Stone proceeded, "that an actor who is
  very favourably known here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wallie Addison," she interrupted tersely. "He's keen on the play but he
  hasn't got the money. I'm looking for some one to put it up. If that's your
  errand, you're welcome."</p>

  <p>"How much money would be required to produce the play, and who is a
  responsible person with whom I can deal?"</p>

  <p>"I guess the whole business can go through me," Miss McAlister said, a
  little doubtfully, "but you've got to understand, Mr. Stone, that producing a
  play in New York, and renting a theatre, isn't child's play. The theatre's to
  let now for a year at two thousand dollars a week. To produce the play and
  have something in hand for expenses and salaries, there should be another
  thirty thousand dollars available."</p>

  <p>"That makes how much in English money?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>Miss Jane McAlister pencilled it out.</p>

  <p>"It means about eight thousand pounds cash," she announced, "and about
  five hundred a week for the rent. The lessor of the theatre would require
  guarantees."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone drew a cheque book from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"I arrange this through you, then?"</p>

  <p>"Say, are you going to finance the whole show?" she demanded eagerly.</p>

  <p>"That was the object of my visit," he assured her.</p>

  <p>"Well, this is great!" she exclaimed. "I'll 'phone down for Wallie. It's
  he who's got the option on the theatre. You understand, Mr. Stone, that the
  money will be wanted in cash?"</p>

  <p>"I bank at the Bank of England," Benjamin Stone remarked, "and they have a
  branch here. They will honour my cheques. Ring up your friend Mr. Addison at
  once, Miss McAlister, but afterwards one word more, please."</p>

  <p>Jane McAlister was busy on the telephone for several minutes, then she
  laid down the instrument with a smile of content.</p>

  <p>"Wallie will be right over," she announced. "Now for that other word, Mr.
  Stone?"</p>

  <p>"There's no need to tell the young man just yet who is finding the money,"
  his guardian admonished. "He'll find out by and by, no doubt, but just at
  present&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's O. K.," Miss McAlister interrupted brusquely. "Philip won't care.
  He's not much of a business man, anyway. I shall just tell him that I've
  found a backer, and that will be all he'll want to know&mdash;at first, at
  any rate.&mdash;You'll stay and meet Mr. Addison?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly!" was the ready assent. "I think it will be best for me to go
  with him to the lessors of the theatre. I should like to have everything
  fixed up, if possible, before luncheon."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why not," she mused. "For an Englishman, you're some hustler.
  What's your hurry, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sailing for England to-night," he announced,&mdash;"that is, if I can
  see this affair through first."</p>

  <p>"If you can show the dollars," Jane McAlister assured him, "you can see
  almost any piece of business in the world through in New York in half a day.
  Wallie won't keep us waiting&mdash;I can promise you that."</p>

  <p>"Before he arrives," Benjamin Stone said, "I want to offer you my thanks,
  Miss McAlister, for an act of great kindness which you once performed to my
  niece."</p>

  <p>"Your niece?" she repeated. "Who's she?"</p>

  <p>"Rosina Vonet&mdash;the young woman whom you took into your rooms at the
  Savoy one night."</p>

  <p>"You don't say!" Miss McAlister exclaimed, with interest. "Why, you're the
  uncle these young people lived with up in Norchester, then? I've heard of
  you, but they neither of them ever mentioned your name."</p>

  <p>"You were very kind to Rosina that night," Benjamin Stone continued, "and
  I'm glad to be able to thank you."</p>

  <p>"As to the kindness," she declared, "that's nothing worth talking about. A
  woman of my age who doesn't help a young girl who is up against it would be a
  pretty mean creature. But now I know who you are, Mr. Stone, I'd like to ask
  you this: Do you think you were right in letting a girl as beautiful as your
  niece be around London alone, struggling to make a living?"</p>

  <p>"I think I was very wrong," Benjamin Stone admitted. "I have tried to make
  amends. My other ward, if you have ever heard of him&mdash;Matthew
  Garner&mdash;I have already been able to help out of a serious difficulty.
  You see yourself that I am doing what I can for Philip. Rosina is different.
  I have failed to understand her, and I have perhaps failed in my trust. I
  left money for her in London, which, I understand, by a cable which I
  received last night, she has refused to touch. That is why I am returning to
  England at once."</p>

  <p>"She is a sweet child," Jane McAlister declared. "If I can fix things to
  be in London in the fall, I shall hope to be at her wedding."</p>

  <p>"You will be a very welcome guest," her visitor assured her.</p>

  <p>"And here's Wallie, sure enough," Miss McAlister went on, as she
  recognised a familiar voice in the outer office. "That's some hustle for a
  lazy man! Come right in, Wallie," she called, as a man thrust his head
  tentatively through the half-open door. "Come right in and shake hands with
  Mr. Benjamin Stone of England."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="b-18"
     name="b-18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Rosina lay in bed and watched the sunlight pour into her
  room through the wide-flung window. It was a very shabby, though scrupulously
  neat apartment. A typewriter stood upon the table, carefully covered over.
  The pages of copying which she had completed on the previous night were all
  sorted and in order by its side. Her clothes were neatly folded up. Her
  little brown teapot and two slices of bread stood ready upon the tray. She
  looked around and shivered. The place spelt poverty, dire and complete. She
  was conscious of an appetite which those two slices of bread could do nothing
  to appease, of a call to the sunshine which was hopeless, a longing for the
  country unrealisable. She swung slowly out of bed, opened a drawer, took out
  her purse, shook it vigorously and counted its contents. Three and sixpence
  and two stamps were all she could find, and, before she went out even for a
  Sunday morning stroll, her landlady was expecting the rent, unpaid the night
  before, of twenty-five shillings.</p>

  <p>She leaned out of the window until she could catch a glimpse of a distant
  church clock. It was nine o'clock&mdash;later than she had expected. She
  fingered her coins again, took threepence away, clad herself in a flimsy
  dressing gown and marched out on to the landing.</p>

  <p>"I'll start the day recklessly, anyhow," she murmured to herself, as she
  pressed the coins into the automatic receptacle of the bathroom and waited
  whilst the door swung open.</p>

  <p>She stayed there for fully half an hour, and returned to her dreary little
  room in a more cheerful frame of mind, put on her kettle and watched it boil
  whilst she dressed. There was no milk, and only one knob of sugar in the
  little canister. The bread she felt with her finger and sighed as she
  realised how hard it was. She ate a few mouthfuls and felt her appetite
  depart, drank her wishy-washy tea and slowly completed her toilette. She was
  just about to sit down at her typewriter when there was a knock at the door.
  In reply to her somewhat dubious invitation to enter, Violet, very smartly
  dressed for the sunny morning, put in her head and entered, closing the door
  behind her.</p>

  <p>"You cat, Rosina!" she exclaimed. "Why have you called off our little
  excursion?"</p>

  <p>"Work to do," was the terse reply.</p>

  <p>"You're not working and I don't believe it," her visitor declared, looking
  around the room in vain for a chair and finally seating herself on the bed.
  "What's wrong, dear? You might as well tell me. I bore you often enough with
  my troubles."</p>

  <p>"Nothing much is wrong," Rosina answered, "except that I haven't any
  money."</p>

  <p>"I called you a cat when I came in," Violet observed deliberately, "and I
  repeat it. You're a miserable little sneak. I offered to stand treat, didn't
  I? You can't sit at home on a Sunday morning like this."</p>

  <p>"You paid for nearly everything last Sunday," Rosina reminded her. "I know
  you're a dear, Violet, but I can't bear it."</p>

  <p>"Utter selfishness!" Violet pronounced. "Here am I dying for a jaunt in
  the country, and you make all these silly excuses. I'm drawing five pounds a
  week now, stupid, and my clothes don't cost me a penny. Victor gives me
  nearly everything, and there's always somebody about to take one out to lunch
  or dine. What's the use of having a few shillings in your pocket if you can't
  share them with a pal? Come on, dear. Get ready. I don't want to do anything
  swanky, and we won't have anything to do with the boys. We'll just take a bus
  down to Richmond, if you like, and sit in the park, under the trees."</p>

  <p>Rosina rose to her feet. She came over and sat by her friend's side, and
  rested her head for a moment on her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You're the dearest thing, Violet," she said, "and I'm a horrid little
  prig, but I hate it. If I thought I could pay you back some time, I'd rather
  borrow from you outright."</p>

  <p>"Why, you stupid little owl, you'll have all the money you want, some
  day," Violet assured her. "Wouldn't you be the first, now, to insist upon
  looking after a friend who'd struck a bad streak? Of course you would! What
  sort of a day do you think I'm going to have by myself, if I think of you
  stewing up here? Why the devil don't you come back to Madame's? The woman
  can't bite you, and you know all about us girls. Tommyrot, I call it! You sit
  here and nurse your pride and starve. By and by the oof will flow in, but
  you'll have hollow cheeks, you'll have lost your looks and probably be in a
  consumption. Look at your breakfast! Wouldn't keep a sparrow alive! Get your
  hat on, you silly idiot. I shall sit here till you do, anyhow.&mdash;Hullo!
  Another visitor!"</p>

  <p>Rosina made a grimace.</p>

  <p>"That's my landlady, come for twenty-five shillings I haven't got," she
  said, "though why she troubles to knock, I can't imagine.&mdash;Come in, Mrs.
  Bendle."</p>

  <p>The door opened a little hesitatingly and Benjamin Stone entered. The two
  girls stared at him in blank amazement. He removed his hat and looked about
  him in some confusion.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry if I have done wrong in coming up," he began. "I was very
  anxious to see you, Rosina."</p>

  <p>Rosina recovered herself.</p>

  <p>"This is my uncle, Mr. Benjamin Stone&mdash;my dear friend, Miss Violet
  Shaw," she said. "I&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Everything that Rosina had meant to say died away upon her lips. Benjamin
  Stone was wearing clothes cut by a West End tailor, and which were eminently
  unsuitable for a night watchman at three pounds a week. He was entirely
  transformed, both in appearance and expression. Violet plunged into the
  breach.</p>

  <p>"If you're Rosina's uncle," she said, smiling up at him, "you've got one
  of the dearest girls for a niece any one ever had, only&mdash;don't think me
  impertinent, will you?&mdash;why don't some of you look after her? She can't
  take care of herself any more than a baby, and she's as proud as a female
  Lucifer, if there can be such a thing. We've been going out for walks
  together, the last few Sundays&mdash;little excursions that didn't cost more
  than a few shillings. We've both loved them. To-day, Rosina sends word that
  she can't come. I've come along to rout her out, and I've found out why. She
  hasn't got the money to pay her share, and she's too proud to be
  treated."</p>

  <p>"Don't listen to her," Rosina begged. "It's been just one of my bad weeks,
  that's all. My uncle has very little money, either, Violet," she added.
  "Three pounds a week, isn't it, Matthew pays?&mdash;Stingy beast! A man needs
  more money to live on than a girl, too."</p>

  <p>"If your uncle only gets three pounds a week," Violet exclaimed, gazing at
  him wonderingly, "all I can say is&mdash;he doesn't look like it!"</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone was already losing his fears and his awkwardness. Rosina
  was unchanged. She bore no malice. He felt a wonderful sense of
  contentment.</p>

  <p>"It is quite true," he admitted, with a smile, "that I have been drawing
  three pounds a week as a night watchman, but I took the post, not from any
  need of the money, I can assure you, but for a reason I shall have to explain
  to Rosina some day. In the meantime, as to this little Sunday excursion. What
  about my being host? You won't mind accepting a little hospitality from your
  uncle, Rosina? And so far as regards this young lady&mdash;Miss Shaw, I think
  you said?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Violet," the young lady interrupted. "I'm on, if you're thinking of
  including me. What fun! We thought of a bus to Richmond Park."</p>

  <p>"I have a car outside," Benjamin Stone announced, a little diffidently.
  "We might, if you cared to, go a little farther&mdash;Surrey, or even down to
  the sea."</p>

  <p>"Whoop!" Violet exclaimed, springing down from her seat on the bed. "The
  uncle of a fairy story! You're not kidding us?"</p>

  <p>"My niece will assure you that I am not a person who indulges in practical
  jokes," Benjamin Stone declared, smiling.</p>

  <p>"And you really are her uncle?" Violet demanded.</p>

  <p>"I most certainly am," he assented.</p>

  <p>"Then, for God's sake, give that old scarecrow downstairs twenty-five
  shillings and let Rosina have a happy day!"</p>

  <p>"Violet!" Rosina expostulated. "How can you!"</p>

  <p>"I am very much obliged to you, Miss Violet," Benjamin Stone assured her
  eagerly, opening his pocketbook and withdrawing a note with trembling
  fingers. "Rosina, perhaps you will arrange this. In case your friend should
  think too hardly of me, let me explain that I returned from New York at a
  moment's notice, immediately I learned by cable that you had refused to draw
  any of the money I left for you."</p>

  <p>Rosina stared at him.</p>

  <p>"That <i>you</i> left for me?" she exclaimed. "Do you mean the money that
  the lawyers in Lincoln's Inn offered me?"</p>

  <p>"Why, of course!" her uncle replied. "I never imagined that there could be
  any reason why you should refuse to accept it. I even left it without
  disclosing my name, in case you should have any scruples."</p>

  <p>Rosina wrung her hands. There were tears in her eyes, although she was
  trying to laugh.</p>

  <p>"And I refused it because I thought it was from another man!" she cried.
  "Oh, what an idiot I have been! I should have taken it at once if I had
  dreamed it had come from you, Uncle Benjamin," she assured him. "Please
  believe that. I was very angry with you once, but it was chiefly Philip's
  fault, and I had been rather badly tried. I thought you both might have
  trusted me a little more."</p>

  <p>"If Rosina can't be trusted," her friend declared warmly, "there isn't a
  girl in the world who can. She's the best that ever lived. She makes all us
  others feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes."</p>

  <p>"She has made me feel ashamed of myself," Benjamin Stone admitted gruffly,
  "but I am hoping to be able to make amends."</p>

  <p>"And meanwhile," Violet insisted, "tie on your hat, Rosina, and let's
  start off."</p>

  <p>They descended the stairs, waiting for a moment whilst Rosina, with a
  sense of relief almost indescribable, sought out her landlady and discharged
  her liability. In the street, Violet gave a little scream of delight.</p>

  <p>"A Rolls-Royce limousine!" she exclaimed. "Rosina! Did you ever dream of
  such a thing!"</p>

  <p>"Are we really to get in here?" Rosina asked incredulously.</p>

  <p>"My dear," her uncle replied, "you can ride in it every day, if you want
  to. I bought it the day before I left for New York."</p>

  <p>She clutched at his arm.</p>

  <p>"You've seen Philip?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"I've seen Philip and I've read part of his play," he told her. "It is to
  be produced at the Grand Theatre in New York next month. A Mr. Walter Addison
  is taking the principal part, and they all say that Philip will make a
  fortune. In any case, he is coming over here in a few months."</p>

  <p>It was all too wonderful. They seemed to be in the country almost at once,
  a country bathed in sunshine, soaked with perfumes after the warm rain of the
  day before. They lunched at a famous but secluded hostelry amongst the Surrey
  hills, the two girls in the wildest spirits. Their table was near the window,
  and Rosina suddenly caught hold of her uncle's hand.</p>

  <p>"Uncle, look!" she exclaimed. "Look at the car coming up the hill!"</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone smiled grimly as he looked out and recognised its
  occupants. A very handsome limousine car, which had somehow the appearance of
  being a little too flashy, with claret-coloured cushions, and a footman by
  the side of the chauffeur, both in claret-coloured livery, was slowly
  crawling up to the entrance. Mrs. Garner, erstwhile Ford, was leaning back in
  the right-hand corner seat, a dignified vision in pongee dust cloak, motoring
  hat and veil. Matthew, in grey tweeds and Homburg hat, sat by her side,
  smoking a cigar. They were a very opulent-looking couple.</p>

  <p>"Matthew seems different, somehow," Rosina reflected.</p>

  <p>"I think he has had rather a shock," her uncle remarked. "Perhaps it has
  steadied him."</p>

  <p>The newcomers arrived in the dining room presently, and Matthew recognised
  Rosina and Benjamin Stone with a stare of amazement. Afterwards, however, he
  ventured upon a salutation which Rosina amiably returned. Mrs. Garner raised
  her lorgnettes.</p>

  <p>"She's asking about us," Rosina whispered in delight. "Can't you hear
  her?&mdash;'Who are those queer people, Matthew?' What a pity you two look so
  smart and I'm so shabby! Uncle Benjamin, does Matthew know that you really
  didn't need that three pounds a week?"</p>

  <p>"I think he must have guessed," was the quiet admission.</p>

  <p>After lunch they sat on the terrace, basking in the sunshine and looking
  out over the rolling stretches of heather. Benjamin Stone left them, after a
  time, to order the car, and, a few minutes later, Matthew came deliberately
  across to where the two girls were waiting.</p>

  <p>"Rosina," he asked, as they shook hands, "can you spare me a moment? There
  is something I should like to say to you. Perhaps your friend will be very
  kind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Take my place," Violet interrupted, jumping up. "I am going after your
  Uncle Benjamin, Rosina. I think he's too sweet to be left alone for a
  minute."</p>

  <p>Matthew sank heavily into the vacant seat. He turned towards Rosina. He
  was very impressive.</p>

  <p>"Rosina," he said, "I am very glad indeed to see you with your uncle. I
  should like to speak to you seriously."</p>

  <p>Rosina's eyes twinkled.</p>

  <p>"You're sure you mean seriously, Matthew?"</p>

  <p>Matthew neither smiled nor looked self-conscious.</p>

  <p>"Listen to what I am going to say, Rosina," he begged. "It is for your own
  good. Your uncle is evidently disposed to befriend you. Lose no opportunity
  of keeping in his good graces. For some reason or other, he has chosen to
  wilfully deceive us. He assisted in the circulation of reports as to his
  losses. The whole thing is ridiculous. He is not only a very wealthy man but
  he is a very clever one. It was I who was the fool down at Norchester. All
  the improvements I kept pressing upon him to put in the factory he was
  already putting into the other factories in the town, every one of which,
  Rosina&mdash;listen!&mdash;belong to him. The whole boot and shoe trade of
  Norchester is in his hands. He let our old factory run down because it was a
  tumble-down place and not worth spending money upon, and because all the
  other up-to-date factories already belonged to him. Why he pretended to be
  poor I can't tell you, but I can tell you this&mdash;he is a wealthier man
  than many a merchant prince of the City of London."</p>

  <p>"How wonderful!" Rosina murmured. "And yet he really worked as a
  nightwatchman in your warehouse?"</p>

  <p>"It was a fad of his," Matthew declared. "You needn't know too much, but I
  thought I'd give you the straight tip. He put his hand into his pocket, at
  the very time that he was drawing three pounds a week from me, and fetched
  out thirty thousand pounds. I know this for a fact, for we&mdash;er&mdash;go
  to the same broker."</p>

  <p>"How wonderful!" Rosina repeated.</p>

  <p>"I'll be getting back," Matthew said, looking nervously over his shoulder.
  "I'd like to bring Adelaide over, but she's rather peculiar and&mdash;well,
  you understand, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>"Absolutely!" Rosina assented. "Run along, Matthew dear, before she sees
  you."</p>

  <p>"Now you know where you are," he concluded earnestly, as he rose to his
  feet. "Don't know anything, be kind to the old man, and you'll find it will
  pay."</p>

  <p>He hurried off, with the self-satisfied bearing of one who has performed a
  kindly action. Rosina watched the Rolls-Royce come curving round the hill.
  She stepped down happily to meet it.</p>

  <p>As they neared London, on their homeward journey, Benjamin Stone broke a
  somewhat prolonged silence.</p>

  <p>"Young ladies," he asked, "have you any plans for the evening?"</p>

  <p>"I am perfectly free," Rosina declared, without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"I can't remember any engagement for the present," Violet echoed.</p>

  <p>"Then I should be glad if you would both dine with me at half-past eight,"
  he invited.</p>

  <p>Rosina passed her arm through his. Violet's acceptance had been prompt and
  unconditional.</p>

  <p>"Uncle," she whispered, "aren't I an idiot! I cleared out some of my old
  clothes the other day&mdash;I haven't a frock but the one I am wearing."</p>

  <p>"You don't need to worry about that, dear," Violet assured her. "We're
  near enough the same figure. I've two or three you can choose from."</p>

  <p>"Capital!" her uncle exclaimed. "Rosina will not be returning to her
  rooms, so I would suggest that you bring anything you can spare round to the
  Savoy&mdash;say at eight o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Not returning to my room?" Rosina repeated wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"I shall give you ten minutes there to fetch your typewriter and anything
  you must have," Benjamin Stone announced, "and afterwards I shall pray that
  we both forget the place. I have a pleasant little suite at the Savoy,
  overlooking the river. I think you will like your apartments. Miss Violet
  must come and tell us whether she approves."</p>

  <p>They reached London in time for tea at the Savoy, and Violet, when they
  made their little visit of inspection, approved very volubly indeed. Rosina's
  bedroom and bathroom, all in white, were charming. The sitting room, fragrant
  with the perfume from great bowls of roses, had wide, curving windows looking
  out over the Thames.</p>

  <p>"If some one would only send me a fairy uncle!" Violet sighed, as she
  concluded her delightful tour of investigation. "I am off now. I'll be here
  with gown and et ceteras at eight o'clock, Rosina. What fun we shall
  have!"</p>

  <p>She left them, and Rosina came over almost shyly to her uncle's
  easy-chair, and sat on the floor by his side.</p>

  <p>"If I seem stupid, I can't help it," she said. "I can't realise it all
  yet. I was just getting a little frightened of life. And even now I don't
  realise that it is you&mdash;really you&mdash;Uncle Benjamin!"</p>

  <p>"We are both seeing life a little differently, dear," he declared kindly.
  "We have both made our mistakes, only yours have been the faults of youth and
  inexperience&mdash;mine, alas! the blunders of cast-iron prejudice.&mdash;Now
  I am going to leave you for an hour. You will need a rest."</p>

  <p>She heard his receding footsteps, and the lift descend. Suddenly she had
  an idea. She followed him, running down the stairs with flying footsteps. He
  was stepping into a taxi as she reached the courtyard. She was just in time
  to hear the direction. She motioned the porter to open the door, and stepped
  in beside him.</p>

  <p>"May I come, Uncle?" she begged. "I guessed where you were going."</p>

  <p>He held her hand and they drove off together. They found a quiet corner in
  the Abbey, and there was nothing more wonderful to Rosina in that whole
  wonderful day than the ensuing hour. The place was full of shadows. Even the
  lights only seemed to shine into obscure places. The music which pealed
  softly through the great building, the distant voices of the choir, the
  intoning of the priest&mdash;everything seemed blended together towards a
  wonderful peace. Later on, in the far distance, she could dimly see the
  figure of the preacher in white, and hear his sonorous voice as he leaned
  from the pulpit. They shared a hymn book for that final, wonderful hymn. They
  kneeled side by side for the benediction, heard the low strains of the great
  organ break the stillness that followed, heard it rise and swell into long
  strains of triumphant melody. When, afterwards, they reached the door, Rosina
  took her uncle's arm. They neither of them exchanged more than a casual word,
  yet they both knew that, in some mysterious way, a strangeness which it might
  have taken years to have bridged over, had gone.</p>

  <p>As they entered the hotel, men and women in evening dress were passing
  down to the brilliantly lit restaurant. From the distance came the strains of
  pagan music. Rosina looked up at her companion a little anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Uncle," she said, "are you quite sure that you don't mind dining down
  there? We might go somewhere much quieter. After all, it is Sunday
  night."</p>

  <p>"My dear," he answered slowly, "I have changed my views on many subjects.
  The observance of the Lord's Day is more inward than outward. I don't think
  that any one could feel more devoutly grateful than I do to-night."</p>

  <p>They moved on towards the lift. Rosina found realisation even yet a little
  difficult.</p>

  <p>"Do you still own the chapel?" she asked, a little shyly.</p>

  <p>"Bless you, yes!" he answered. "I preached there a month ago. And, by the
  by, they asked me to stand for Parliament for Norchester at the next
  election, when I was down there. Give me something to do besides looking
  after you young people.&mdash;You'd better run up," he added, as the lift
  descended, "and see what Miss Violet has brought you to wear. Here's the key.
  I am going to order our table and dinner. I shall be up to change, in a
  minute or two. We'll meet in the sitting room."</p>

  <p>The joy of the evening remained unclouded. Benjamin Stone had chosen the
  right table, with the aid of a deferential <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>
  had ordered exactly the right sort of dinner, and there was even wine, of
  which he himself partook, although sparingly. His dinner suit had been made
  by the same West End tailor to whom he had given a large order a few months
  ago. Rosina, in Violet's most simple evening dress, looked radiant, and
  Violet herself proved that she fully possessed that finer note of humanity
  which finds unalloyed pleasure in the happiness of others. It seemed quite a
  fitting conclusion to the evening when Benjamin Stone, with the air of one
  who has just remembered something, thrust his hand into his pocket and
  brought out a small, grey morocco case, inscribed with the name of one of New
  York's most famous jewellers.</p>

  <p>"I don't know quite what your fancy is for jewellery, Rosina," he said,
  "but they told me over in New York that, at your age, it would be pearls.
  Will you just slip these on? And, by the by," he went on hastily, as he saw
  Rosina's eyes begin to fill and the fingers which played with the gems
  tremble, "there was a little thing I saw there which rather took my
  fancy&mdash;not that I know much about such matters. I think it would be very
  nice if Miss Violet were to wear it in memory of this evening."</p>

  <p>Violet gasped as her host produced a smaller packet from his other pocket,
  and, withdrawing a small platinum and diamond ring from its case, placed it
  upon her finger.</p>

  <p>"Rosina," she cried, "if I wake up I shall kill myself! I've gone weak at
  the knees, staring at rings like this through the windows of Cartier's. I
  never dreamed I'd ever own one. I don't believe anybody's real. I shall ask
  the waiter to pinch me, in a moment, if some one doesn't talk."</p>

  <p>Rosina leaned forward. They were very wonderful pearls which hung around
  her neck&mdash;pearls of wonderful shape, with a faint, pinky lustre,
  opalescent and softly radiant.</p>

  <p>"It's all real, Violet," she faltered, "beautifully, wonderfully real.
  Uncle, I can't kiss you here&mdash;I can't even thank you&mdash;but wait till
  we get upstairs!"</p>

  <p>"You're not even my uncle, worse luck," Violet exclaimed, "but I
  say&mdash;like Rosina&mdash;wait till we get upstairs!"</p>

  <p>Yet perhaps the most wonderful part of the evening, to Rosina, was its
  termination, when her fervid but almost hysterical farewell to Violet had
  been spoken, when, for the first time in his life, Benjamin Stone had
  voluntarily kissed her good night, and she was alone in her luxurious little
  bed-chamber. She wandered around for a moment aimlessly, looking at the
  exquisite linen, the comfortable gilt bedstead, Violet's nightdress laid out
  upon the coverlet, the little dressing case which her friend had packed for
  her upon the table. She peered into the bathroom, all white tiles and silver
  taps, looked into the bevelled mirror, and wondered at the multiplicity of
  towels. Then she returned to her bedroom, drew up the blind and looked out
  across the river. There was the Embankment, along which they three pilgrims
  had walked on the first day of their arrival in London, talking of wonderful
  things, making marvellous plans, a little too self-reliant, a little
  over-sanguine, more than a little narrow-visioned. After all, more or less,
  they had stood the strain. Even Matthew, according to his lights&mdash;he,
  too, had survived. She had a moment's shuddering recollection of those
  grisly, phantasmal hours of temptation&mdash;saw Philip throwing up his arms
  once, only to struggle with renewed strength to the shore; saw herself
  flying, often with tired footsteps, from the ugly shapes which seemed always
  to pursue her. She remembered a sentence in Philip's letter&mdash;the letter
  Benjamin Stone had brought her&mdash;and her lips curved into a wonderful
  smile. Theirs had been the same inspiration, the same weapon of conquest.
  There was even some faint echo of the same eternal truth in Benjamin Stone's
  altered attitude towards life. For there had crept into her mind, as she
  stood there&mdash;and the words lingered in her brain until her eyes closed
  in sleep&mdash;one of the few sentences which had reached them clearly in
  their shadowy corner of the Abbey, from that white-surpliced, dignified
  figure who had a habit of every now and then raising his voice so that one
  particular sentence stood out above the others:</p><br>

  <p><i>Love overcomes evil. Love leads always to good, but be sure that you
  know what love is.</i></p><br>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="b-19"
     name="b-19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Rosina thought more than once of that Sunday night dinner
  party when, scarcely a year later, she, with her husband and Benjamin Stone,
  M.P., a little flushed with the excitement of a wonderful evening, stood
  awaiting the arrival of their guests before they descended to the already
  crowded supper room of the Savoy. Interesting fragments of conversation
  reached them from every side. Apparently no one spoke or thought of anything
  else except the genius of the play, still being played in New York after
  nearly twelve months' run, but produced that night for the first time in
  London. A well-known critic, standing a few feet away from Rosina, expressed
  himself in no undecided terms.</p>

  <p>"For a beginner and a young man," he pronounced, "such work is, to my
  mind, almost incredible. This fellow Garth&mdash;I am to meet him at the club
  to-morrow night; they're giving him a dinner there&mdash;must be the one man
  we've all been looking for. He is absolutely Grecian in his breadth and the
  splendour of his vision, and yet he has that intense hold upon modernity,
  that grip upon the little things that tell in our daily life, which marks the
  great artist. I shall drink my first glass of wine to-night to Philip
  Garth."</p>

  <p>"Steady, old chap!" one of his companions admonished. "You ought to keep
  all this for the <i>Daily Thunderer</i>."</p>

  <p>"I'm going down to Fleet Street to write my review after supper," the
  critic answered. "Nothing I can say to-night&mdash;and I don't feel like
  talking about anything else but the play&mdash;will rob the public of a
  single word that belongs to them to-morrow."</p>

  <p>The little group of men moved off. Rosina, an exquisite vision in
  shimmering white, laughed into her husband's face.</p>

  <p>"Aren't we going to have our heads turned to-morrow morning!" she
  exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Not more than mine is just now," he whispered, gazing at her
  rapturously.</p>

  <p>Then, out from the gentlemen's cloakroom, with the obvious air of waiting
  for his feminine belongings, came Matthew. He was a little stouter, he was
  dressed with great precision, and he gave one somehow the impression of
  glossiness. There were a few streaks of grey in his hair, and the flesh under
  his eyes seemed to have coarsened a little, so that they were narrower than
  ever. He recognised Rosina at once, and, after a moment's hesitation,
  approached her. Benjamin Stone had just introduced Philip to a fellow M.P.,
  and the three were talking together.</p>

  <p>"Well, Rosina," Matthew said, jerking his head towards her uncle, "I gave
  you the right tip, didn't I? You've hung on to the old boy, all right."</p>

  <p>Rosina laughed.</p>

  <p>"I've scarcely let him out of my sight since that day," she assured
  him.</p>

  <p>"I'm a prosperous man," Matthew went on, "and it's not often I don't come
  out top dog at a bargain, but I'm never ashamed to admit it when I'm beaten.
  He's as hard as nails, is Uncle Benjamin, and as cute as they make them. What
  I cannot understand about him, even now, though, is what made him take on
  that job of watchman at my warehouse at three pounds a week."</p>

  <p>"Conscience, perhaps," Rosina replied, "although I'm not sure that he had
  much to reproach himself with. But why not ask him?"</p>

  <p>"The old boy hasn't much to say to me," Matthew confided. "I'm the
  successful one of the three of you, but he doesn't seem to cotton to me,
  somehow. Philip doing any better?"</p>

  <p>"A little, thank you," Rosina replied. "We were married some time ago, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"Were you really! Well, I suppose you know your own business best, and
  there's the old man behind you both. Doing you proud to-night, isn't
  he&mdash;Savoy for supper, eh? We come three nights a week. My wife's so fond
  of the theatre."</p>

  <p>Philip and the man to whom Benjamin Stone had introduced him&mdash;a
  famous essayist and traveller&mdash;had entered into an intimate
  conversation. Benjamin Stone turned away and approached Matthew and Rosina.
  The former held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Glad to see you here, sir," he said. "Haven't congratulated you yet on
  your election."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Matthew," the older man answered. "You haven't forgotten
  Rosina, then?"</p>

  <p>"Never did," Matthew replied unblushingly. "I was always looking her up in
  the old days."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Garner, elaborately gowned, and a little more ponderous than ever,
  sailed up behind and tapped him on the shoulder with her fan.</p>

  <p>"I am ready, Matthew," she announced.</p>

  <p>Matthew seized the opportunity.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he said, "I should like to introduce Mr. Benjamin Stone, my
  guardian down at Norchester, you know; my wife, sir."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Garner shook hands with some reserve. She was eyeing Rosina with
  disfavour.</p>

  <p>"I am very glad to meet Matthew's wife," Benjamin Stone declared. "Matthew
  has forgotten, though, that my niece, Mrs. Garth, is here. Let me present her
  to you, Mrs. Garner. Rosina was also my ward at Norchester."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Garner's bow was frigid in the extreme. She opened her mouth to
  suggest moving on.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Stone is M.P. for Norchester now, my dear," Matthew told her. "Buying
  a house in London, I understand. Perhaps we can persuade him to come and see
  us."</p>

  <p>"A Member of Parliament?" Mrs. Garner said tolerantly. "A very
  distinguished position. I am not sure that I should not prefer Matthew to
  take an interest in politics to going in for civic honours.&mdash;Quite a gay
  crowd here to-night, Mr. Stone."</p>

  <p>Benjamin Stone, who was quietly amused, murmured some answering remark. He
  drew Rosina's hand through his arm.</p>

  <p>"We've just come from the theatre," Mrs. Garner announced
  condescendingly,&mdash;"first night of 'The New World,' you know. Most
  wonderful play! Sure to be a great success!"</p>

  <p>"We have also been there," Benjamin Stone remarked.</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" Mrs. Garner vouchsafed. "It was rather a favour to get seats,
  wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>"You see, my husband wrote the play," Rosina observed, with a faint
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Your husband?" Mrs. Garner repeated incredulously. "Your husband the
  author of 'The New World'?"</p>

  <p>"Why, it was written by a chap named Almas Phillips," Matthew put
  in,&mdash;"been running for nearly a year in America. Fellow's made pots of
  money."</p>

  <p>"'Almas Phillips,'" Benjamin Stone explained, "is Philip's pseudonym. Here
  he is to speak for himself."</p>

  <p>Philip strolled up, shook hands a little reservedly with Matthew, and was
  introduced to Mrs. Garner.</p>

  <p>"It's the most amazing thing I ever heard!" Matthew exclaimed, genuinely
  discomposed. "Do you mean to tell me that you're really Almas Phillips?"</p>

  <p>Philip nodded.</p>

  <p>"They thought a pseudonym was better for my first play, out in New York,"
  he observed.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Garner suddenly unbent. She unbent almost to fulsomeness.</p>

  <p>"My dear Mr. Garth!" she said, shaking his hand. "I congratulate you most
  heartily! And Matthew tells me you're one of his oldest friends! You must
  bring your charming wife to see us. We live in Belgrave Square. Matthew will
  give you a card."</p>

  <p>"You are very kind," Philip murmured.</p>

  <p>"That wonderful James Hunter, who plays your hero," Mrs. Garner gushed on,
  "I never miss anything he acts in. I think he is simply marvellous."</p>

  <p>Philip made a little bow of farewell.</p>

  <p>"Hunter is a very great actor," he agreed. "By the by, I see him and his
  wife coming downstairs. They are my guests to-night. You will excuse me.
  Rosina?"</p>

  <p>Mr. and Mrs. Garner most unwillingly moved on. Rosina was soon the centre
  of a group of new friends and old. Douglas Erwen was there, filled with the
  immense satisfaction of a man who has discovered a new sensation; Violet, a
  little shy but by no means neglected. Their supper party&mdash;a round table
  in the middle of the room&mdash;was the wonder and admiration of every one.
  From their distant corner, Mr. and Mrs. Garner looked at it with envious
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"You never do seem to keep in with the right sort of people, Matthew," his
  wife complained irritably. "Mr. Garth didn't seem at all pleased to see
  you."</p>

  <p>"You snubbed his wife so," Matthew reminded her.</p>

  <p>"How was I to know who the little chit was," Mrs. Garner replied angrily,
  "especially after seeing you flirting with her in Kensington Gardens!"</p>

  <p>"And how was I to know that Philip wasn't such an ass as he seemed?"
  Matthew rejoined gloomily. "The fellow was always
  wool-gathering&mdash;couldn't add up a column of figures correctly, never
  saved a ha'penny in his life."</p>

  <p>"And there they are, and here we are!" Mrs. Garner wound up.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Philip, during the course of supper, read them out a telegram of
  anticipatory congratulation from New York:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram"><tt>BEST WISHES FROM THE COMPANY HERE AND CONGRATULATIONS
  ON YOUR CERTAIN SUCCESS. FOUR HUNDREDTH PERFORMANCE HERE, HOUSE PACKED, NOT A
  SEAT FOR A MONTH. JIMMY DUGDALE.</tt></p><br>

  <p>"We shall beat that," Hunter declared confidently.</p>

  <p>"Long life to the play and its author!" some one proposed.</p>

  <p>The toast was drunk and acknowledged. Philip, who, owing to his own
  arrangement of the table, was a great deal nearer to his wife than he ought
  to have been, suddenly felt her eyes seeking his. She raised her glass and
  looked out along the lighted way towards the dark courtyard. He understood
  and also raised his glass. A little thought flashed from one to the other. It
  was a wonderful celebration, but behind it all the greater things were
  moving.</p>
