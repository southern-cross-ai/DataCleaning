  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">NED SWAYLES, the younger of the two men seated in an obscure
  corner of the cheap, odoriferous restaurant of which they were the only
  occupants, stretched out a long, shapely hand across the soiled tablecloth,
  and turned towards him the watch which he had detached from its chain. His
  protuberant knuckles, the prehensile, electric crawl of his fingers, had
  awakened a great many speculations at various times as to the nature of his
  occupation.</p>

  <p>"Twenty minutes after nine," he muttered. "He surely is late."</p>

  <p>His companion, a shock-headed, weedy-looking man, with a mass of black
  hair, unwholesome of appearance, untidily dressed, and apparently as nervous
  as his <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>, grunted assent as he drummed with restless
  fingers upon the table. He had been seated with his eyes fixed upon the door
  for the last ten minutes, starting eagerly whenever a passing shadow darkened
  the threshold, only to relapse into gloom again as the loiterer disappeared.
  The place was really little more than a shop with a back room dignified by
  the name of a restaurant. There were a few meals served there in the daytime,
  scarcely any at night. On a side table, underneath the meat covers, upon
  chipped and unsavoury dishes, reposed half a ham, the worst remains of a
  joint of beef, and a fragment of tinned tongue. A weary-looking salad was
  protected by a piece of muslin. There were no other signs of edibles, but the
  odour of past meals hung unappetisingly about the stuffy apartment. It was
  typical of many eating houses of its class, chiefly to be found in the
  neighbourhood of the great railway termini. The people who eat in them seem
  like the ghouls of disappointed travellers.</p>

  <p>In the doorway, the only waiter&mdash;a disreputable object, half Italian,
  half cockney, with a shirt front which appeared to be tied on to him, and the
  clothes of his profession stained with the gravy of remorseless
  years&mdash;was struggling to get a breath of air. The heat of a long
  summer's day seemed to be reflected from the pavements outside, and the
  coolness of night mercilessly delayed. The heat stole into the unattractive
  little restaurant in gaseous waves. Swayles helped himself from a bottle of
  whisky which stood upon a table between the two men, and the liquid splashed
  on to the tablecloth from his unsteady handling. He drank it after the
  fashion of some of his country-people&mdash;neat, with a hastily filled
  tumbler of flat-looking water to follow.</p>

  <p>"Say, if I'd known what sort of a job this was going to turn out," he
  whined, "I'd never have got myself stuck with it. I wouldn't care so much if
  it were in New York or Chicago. The bulls there know well enough that in
  eleven years I've never parked a gun. I've turned down every show where there
  hasn't been a slick get-away."</p>

  <p>His companion dabbed once more at his moist forehead with a soiled
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I'd have been fool enough to be mixed up in it either?" he
  demanded, with feeble truculence. "I've known Thomas Ryde for fourteen
  years&mdash;a hard, keen little man, but one of the quietest-living, most
  respectable fellows I've ever worked for. Like a blooming machine, he's
  always been&mdash;never late for an appointment, never a glass too much, just
  plodding away, and saving money as though there were nothing else in the
  world worth a thought. I don't understand it even now. To think of him
  knowing how to grab hold of a gun even seems ridiculous. I've never seen him
  raise a little finger against any one."</p>

  <p>Ned Swayles leaned across the table.</p>

  <p>"When I took on the job," he confided hoarsely, "the first question I
  asked was whether it was to be a get-away affair, or a gunning business. I
  give you my word, Huneybell, that I've never touched a gunning job in my
  life. If they catch me, they catch me, and I'm ready to do my stretch. When
  we heard the footsteps in the passage, heard the door open, saw the light go
  up, and that old guy standing there gaping in at us, I was for the window,
  and a get-away quick as I could leg it. Ryde was standing just behind me. He
  didn't move&mdash;didn't say a word. Suddenly I saw his arm shoot out, saw
  the stab of flame, the old man spin round. My God! Do you know, Huneybell,
  I've lived in Chicago mostly since I was a kid, and I've never seen a man's
  light put out before."</p>

  <p>Huneybell shivered in his place. The white agony of fear seemed carved
  into his twitching features.</p>

  <p>"Why the hell doesn't he come?" he groaned. "Here, give me the whisky
  bottle."</p>

  <p>He poured some into a glass, added water, and drank in long, feverish
  gulps. A huge bluebottle came droning around their table. The waiter
  abandoned his vain quest for air and lumbered up the room.</p>

  <p>"Shall I serve the chops, sir?" he enquired. "Perhaps the other
  gentleman's not coming."</p>

  <p>"Of course he's coming," was the angry reply. "He's certain to come. He'll
  be here directly."</p>

  <p>"The chops will be burnt all up," the man warned them.</p>

  <p>"Oh, God, bring them right along," the young American ordered. "Let's eat!
  Let's do something! Here, waiter, got any wine in this bum place?"</p>

  <p>The man produced a battered wine card. Swayles glanced at it in disgust.
  His delicate forefinger pointed to the single printed line under the heading
  of "Champagne."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he demanded. "What mark?"</p>

  <p>"It's champagne," was the cheerful reply. "Forgetta label. Very good
  wine."</p>

  <p>"Bring a bottle," Swayles directed. "Take away this filthy whisky. Don't
  stop for wine glasses; bring tumblers."</p>

  <p>The man shambled off, opening a door in the rear of the place which let in
  a hot wave of air from below, and a smell of greasy cooking.</p>

  <p>"Say, this junk has got me scared, and that's a fact," the young man went
  on, fingering his flowing tie. "Your boss may have hopped it. I don't reckon
  he set about this job meaning to kill two men. Supposing he's made a clear
  get-away&mdash;if we get nabbed they won't know who did the shooting. I guess
  the law's the same over here as with us. If there's a gang, and one man's
  plugged, the lot have got to answer for it."</p>

  <p>Huneybell left off burying his hands in his over-luxuriant hair, took one
  more long gulp of his whisky, and leaned back in his chair. Alcohol had
  accomplished something of its task. He was feeling more of a man.</p>

  <p>"You're a nervous sort of chap for a Chicago thug," he scoffed. "I'm as
  scared as you are about the whole show, but I'm not worrying about Thomas
  Ryde. I'll tell you something about him, Guv'nor. What he says he's going to
  do, he does, and that's the end of it. He's what they call an 'organiser.'
  That's his job in life. What he says comes to pass and don't you forget it. I
  tell you that except for the shooting he'd got this affair cut and dried like
  a master."</p>

  <p>"I lost my pep from the moment he handed out the masks," Swayles
  confessed. "I sure didn't like the feel of them."</p>

  <p>"Never again," Mr. Huneybell declared earnestly, "will I believe in these
  stories of slick American criminals. Mind you, I'm scared to death, but I'm
  going to hand it to the guv'nor that he ran that business almost as well as
  he reorganised the waste-stuff department. What about the get-away, Mr. Ned
  Swayles? Perhaps you like the way he managed that part of the business
  better? Ten miles in one car, eight miles in another, all of us separated,
  west, east, south, even north. Different numbers at every change, and
  different roads, and never a second to wait. Why, we scarcely knew where we
  were ourselves. He must have taken a week thinking that out, and, mark you,
  not a hitch, not a car stopped, not a word of suspicion, and here we are in
  London, and there isn't one of us who hasn't got an alibi in his trousers'
  pocket."</p>

  <p>"It was a swell get-away," Mr. Ned Swayles admitted, "but if one of us
  comes a mucker, he drags the lot of us in. Where's your Mr. Thomas Ryde?
  That's what I want to know."</p>

  <p>A shadow darkened the threshold. The two men leaned forward in their
  places. Huneybell breathed hard. Ned Swayles, from his deep-set eyes, flashed
  out the fires of welcome. A trim, rather short man, approaching early middle
  age, very neatly dressed in cool grey, with gold-rimmed, tight-fitting
  spectacles, Homburg hat, and carrying a carefully furled umbrella, walked
  precisely through the outer shop and entered what was apologetically called
  the "restaurant." He made his way at once to the only occupied table. The two
  men stared at him as though he were a longed-for vision. Something which was
  meant to be a greeting stuck in Swayles' throat; his companion stretched out
  his hand and upset his glass.</p>

  <p>"Before you speak," the newcomer began, taking off his hat and hanging it
  upon a peg, "accept my apologies for this regrettable unpunctuality. For the
  second time since I initiated our little enterprise, things have not gone
  altogether according to plan. In Brighton, I had an intelligent chauffeur. At
  such a time, intelligence is not a quality one appreciates amongst those with
  whom one comes in contact. I thought it as well to get rid of him and come up
  by train."</p>

  <p>Once again that expression of shivering fear whitened the face of the
  young American.</p>

  <p>"Get rid of him!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, not in that sense," Mr. Thomas Ryde protested. "The situation
  presented no threatening possibilities. He saw me off on a Channel steamer to
  Calais, or rather he thought he did, and I came up to town by train. Is it my
  fancy or do I find you two a little disturbed?"</p>

  <p>Huneybell mopped his forehead but remained dumb. Ned Swayles groaned.</p>

  <p>"See here, Mr. Ryde," he explained, "we're scared&mdash;Huneybell and I
  are&mdash;scared stiff. I asked you the question straight. Was it a gun job
  or was it not? You told me to quit that line of talk right off&mdash;swore
  you'd never parked an automatic in your life."</p>

  <p>"My dear young friends, be reasonable," the newcomer urged. "Principles
  depart with the coming of necessity. What else was to be done? Who could have
  divined that that poor fool Rentoul would have stayed in his laboratory till
  the middle of the night, and then have blundered down upon us? There he
  stood, with his hand within a foot of the main electric alarm bell&mdash;a
  single touch, and you know what that would have meant. You must remember too,
  Huneybell, that, notwithstanding our masks, you and I are not altogether
  strangers at Boothroyds' Works."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," Huneybell assented, "but what about poor old
  Michael?"</p>

  <p>The slightest possible shrug of the shoulders. "Poor old Michael"
  apparently failed to evoke any sympathetic reaction.</p>

  <p>"One regrets, of course," was the cool reply, "but he would have had the
  gates closed upon us in a minute if he hadn't been dealt with. By-the-by,
  does this somewhat unsavoury restaurant possess any attractions in the shape
  of food?"</p>

  <p>"We ordered chops," Huneybell confided. "They've been keeping them waiting
  for you I don't know how long."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde looked around him disparagingly.</p>

  <p>"It is not the spot I should have chosen on a hot summer's evening," he
  observed, "to celebrate the termination of a successful enterprise. Still, so
  far as privacy is concerned, it has its points."</p>

  <p>Luigi, who preferred to be called William, came tumbling in through the
  back door. He carried in the crook of his arm a chipped, japanned tray, upon
  which reposed a covered metal dish and some plates. In his other hand he
  carried the bottle of champagne. In cheerful and unembarrassed silence, he
  placed the dish upon the table and displayed its contents, distributed the
  plates, fetched from the cupboard an attenuated-looking bottle, containing a
  few tablespoonfuls of Worcestershire sauce, put salt and pepper in coarse
  utensils of battered glass within reach of his clients, and stood back to
  survey the result of his labours.</p>

  <p>"You didn't order any veg.," he reminded them. "It wouldn't have been no
  good if you had, because we no got any."</p>

  <p>Ned Swayles, described as of no occupation, who boasted an address in
  Riverside Drive, and was a well-known patron of one of New York's famous
  night clubs, gave vent to a little groan. Thomas Ryde, however, helped
  himself to the least repulsive of the chops, passed the other two to his
  companions, and commenced his meal. The waiter, with a flourish, opened the
  wine. Ned Swayles and Huneybell held out their glasses eagerly; Thomas Ryde
  shook his head.</p>

  <p>"A larger tumbler," he directed, beckoning for the whisky bottle, "some
  ice, and Schweppes soda."</p>

  <p>"No gotta ice," the waiter explained equably. "Soda water in syphons."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde motioned him a little nearer.</p>

  <p>"Opposite to us," he confided?"just across the road, as a matter of
  fact&mdash;is a public house where Schweppes soda water can easily be
  procured. Ice too&mdash;just one tumblerful of it&mdash;should present no
  difficulties."</p>

  <p>He produced a ten-shilling note, and the waiter, after a moment's
  hesitation, disappeared with it. Ned Swayles gulped down his glass of
  champagne, and the tang of it, young and sour though it must have been,
  apparently gave him courage. He addressed himself earnestly to Ryde.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Boss," he demanded, "what I want to know is, where am I on
  this deal? I opened the safe for you&mdash;a job not another lad in England
  could have done&mdash;and all we found was six thousand quid and a lot of
  musty old papers. According to you, the thing should have been worth a lot
  more. You guaranteed me&mdash;now, Boss, don't you go denying this, because I
  can be nasty if I try&mdash;you guaranteed me twenty-five grand."</p>

  <p>"Quite correct," Mr. Ryde acknowledged. "Could I trouble you for the
  salt&mdash;just by your sleeve, there&mdash;Thanks. Twenty-five grand is, I
  believe, equivalent to five thousand pounds, Mr. Swayles. A good deal of
  money, but I must confess that you earned it. Your opening of that safe was
  without a doubt a masterpiece of scientific ingenuity."</p>

  <p>"I'll agree I earned it all right," the young man affirmed anxiously, "but
  am I going to get it, Boss? That's what I want to know."</p>

  <p>Mr. Ryde seemed a trifle hurt.</p>

  <p>"My dear Mr. Swayles!" he remonstrated. "I can assure you that I am not a
  man who fails in his engagements."</p>

  <p>"Well, where's it coming from?" the other persisted. "There was only six
  thousand in the safe altogether."</p>

  <p>Mr. Thomas Ryde looked critically at his napkin and, finally deciding in
  its favour, wiped his lips with a corner of it.</p>

  <p>"Following my usual custom, Mr. Swayles," he said, "of taking into my full
  confidence the members of any enterprise in which I am concerned, I will
  confess to you at once that we others were not out altogether for treasury
  notes. To tell you the truth, I did not expect to find much more than we did
  find in available cash. You may have noticed, however, that I removed a
  number of papers at the same time as the money. It is from them that we
  expect to derive our share of the booty. With the exception of one thousand
  pounds which we need for current expenses, the five thousand pounds is yours,
  according to arrangement. The papers are ours."</p>

  <p>The American remained suspicious. The psychology of Mr. Thomas Ryde was a
  thing hidden from him. He had a vague idea that he was being talked at for
  some occult reason.</p>

  <p>"Blast your papers," he muttered, with a little twist of the lips. "Let me
  see the five thou."</p>

  <p>"A trifle impetuous surely, my young friend," was the gently reproving
  rejoinder. "However, since you insist?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Ryde looked around to be sure that the waiter had not returned. Then
  he laid down his knife and fork, picked up the small black bag which he had
  deposited under the table, and handed across a packet.</p>

  <p>"You will find there," he announced, "five thousand pounds, a considerable
  portion of which sum, being evidently intended for the purpose of wages, is
  in treasury notes which cannot be traced. The larger bank notes I should take
  with you to the States and part with them gradually."</p>

  <p>The young man clutched at the parcel, cut the string, and looked inside.
  There seemed to be endless folds of treasury notes there, side by side with a
  thick roll of crisper white paper. He drew a deep sigh of relief and thrust
  the spoils of his enterprise into his pockets.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll say this for you, Boss," he admitted, "you've kept your word,
  and well up to time too."</p>

  <p>"I always keep my word," Thomas Ryde assured him. "You earned your money,
  Mr. Swayles, and if," he added, with a slight smile at the corners of those
  straight lips, "you would like a testimonial, you can have it. I am not an
  expert in such matters, but your opening of that safe still seems to me a
  marvellous piece of scientific ingenuity."</p>

  <p>The young man moistened his lips with his tongue. He had lost his distrust
  of the speaker but he still looked at him as though fascinated.</p>

  <p>"There's only one I've known as cool a hand as you, Boss," he
  acknowledged, "and that was King Cole of West Chicago. Still, you oughtn't to
  have done that killing on us."</p>

  <p>Mr. Thomas Ryde seemed mildly puzzled.</p>

  <p>"I fail to understand your complaint," he protested. "Without the killing,
  we should probably all have been in prison by now and not one of us would
  have made a penny out of all the time and labour we have given to developing
  this little affair. Our careers, too, would have been ruined. I will leave
  you to judge of your other associates, but you must remember that Huneybell
  here and myself are no more criminals than they are."</p>

  <p>"Gee, you're not criminals!" Ned Swayles gasped.</p>

  <p>"By no means. I doubt whether either of us has ever previously committed
  an unlawful action. To have been convicted, therefore, would have been a very
  serious affair for us. We should have lost our position in society and at the
  end of our terms of penal servitude we should have been paupers. You will
  see, therefore, that I had no alternative but to insure against such a
  lamentable prospect."</p>

  <p>The waiter came bustling back. He produced two bottles of Schweppes soda
  water, and a tumblerful of ice. Mr. Thomas Ryde indicated his approval and
  waved away his change from the ten-shilling note.</p>

  <p>"I am very much obliged to you," he said. "I shall now be able to enjoy my
  supper."</p>

  <p>The American filled his glass once more, drained it to the dregs, and rose
  to his feet. There was at last a slight flush of colour in his cheeks. He
  patted the very obvious protuberances which quite spoilt the shape of his
  well-cut suit of clothes.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm through, Boss," he pronounced. "I've worked in a few queer jobs
  in my time, but this one has the lot of them smothered."</p>

  <p>Mr. Ryde nodded an affable farewell.</p>

  <p>"Your boat sails at midnight," he reminded his departing associate.</p>

  <p>"You needn't be afraid that I'll miss it," was the emphatic comment. "This
  old country is too full of surprises for me."</p>

  <p>Huneybell, too, staggered to his feet. He was looking ghastly ill.</p>

  <p>"You're not going?" Thomas Ryde queried.</p>

  <p>"I shall die if I stay another five minutes," he gasped. "I can't eat, I
  can't drink any more&mdash;I'll go home and lie down."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde adjusted his spectacles and stared at the speaker curiously.
  There was no sympathy in his observation&mdash;simply a slight expression of
  intolerant wonder.</p>

  <p>"Just as you like," he agreed. "Keep your mouth shut and be at the office
  at ten o'clock to-morrow morning. You had better get into a taxi," he added,
  as he watched his departing employee stagger towards his hat.</p>

  <p>"I shall be all right as soon as I get out of here," was the feverish
  response.</p>

  <p>The two men left the place together, Ned Swayles' hand still caressing
  those exhilarating extensions of his pockets, Huneybell with black fear
  creeping like mortal sickness through his body. Mr. Thomas Ryde looked after
  them curiously for a moment. Then he selected the better cooked of the two
  remaining chops, mixed himself more whisky and soda, listening with obvious
  pleasure to the tinkle of ice in his glass, and continued his meal.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AT half-past eight precisely, on the eleventh evening after
  the sensational burglary at Boothroyds' Works, near Leeds, Mr. Thomas Ryde
  drove up to the Embankment entrance of the Milan Hotel and by a very
  complicated route succeeded in skirting the <i>foyer</i>, mounted three
  flights of stairs, traversed a long passage, mounted one more flight, and
  finding the door of apartment number 332 unlatched, as he had expected,
  passed rapidly through it and disappeared. Within three minutes, Mr.
  Huneybell, who had to some extent recovered his composure and his poise,
  descended from an omnibus at the corner of the Savoy Hill, and by exactly the
  same route reached the same destination. At twenty-seven minutes to nine, a
  tall young man of somewhat foreign appearance, of pale complexion, with eyes
  of a strange shade of greeny-brown and closely cropped dark hair, presented
  himself at the main reception offices of the Hotel and enquired for Doctor
  Hisedale. The clerk scribbled the number 332 upon a card and handed it to a
  page.</p>

  <p>"The doctor is expecting you, Baron," he announced, with a bow. "The boy
  will take you to his room."</p>

  <p>The tall young man followed his guide as directed. In the last corridor,
  he came face to face with a short, thickly built person of obvious
  transatlantic origin, who was just stepping out of the lift. The two men
  exchanged civilities.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Hartley Wright, isn't it?" the tall young man asked, holding out his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Sure thing, Baron. Glad you haven't forgotten me," the other
  acknowledged, with a grin.</p>

  <p>They made their way to apartment number 332, where their host was engaged
  in conversation with the two previous arrivals. He turned to greet them, a
  tall, lanky man, with grey hair and carefully trimmed grey moustache, the
  former cut so short that it gave his head the appearance of being shaven. He
  had very clear, but hard black eyes, effectually concealed behind heavy
  spectacles. His speech was slow, and his accent slightly guttural. No one
  could have mistaken him for anything but a German.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, Baron," he said. "Welcome, my friend Hartley Wright. We are all
  here now, I think. Introductions," he concluded, with a ponderous attempt at
  levity, "are, I take it, unnecessary. You are all well acquainted."</p>

  <p>The newcomers exchanged restrained greetings with their predecessors. A
  waiter entered with a tray of cocktails. They were drunk almost in silence
  and without any toasting. Mr. Thomas Ryde alone inclined his head towards his
  host. It was the only sign of good-fellowship.</p>

  <p>"Dinner," the latter instructed the waiter, "can now be served. Will you
  take your places, gentlemen. Mr. Ryde, here upon my right; Mr. Hartley Wright
  upon my left; the Baron opposite; Mr. Huneybell in the remaining place. I
  have provided you only with simple fare."</p>

  <p>"The simpler the better," Hartley Wright said tersely. "I'd sooner talk
  than dine."</p>

  <p>"We must remember," Thomas Ryde pointed out, "that we are in England. A
  company of five men meeting to discuss a business project in an hotel
  sitting-room, who did not lunch or dine or drink, would give cause for
  comment. There seems to be a feeling amongst you all which it is not easy to
  understand. Let us shelve it for a moment. Let us play our parts as a little
  assembly of commercial magnates met to discuss an important proposition."</p>

  <p>A waiter entered the room, wheeling forward a side table, upon which were
  set out caviare, hot toast and butter, and bottles of champagne. Doctor
  Hisedale showed his appreciation of his guest's suggestion, and attempted to
  play the part of genial host.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ryde has spoken sensibly," he declared. "We are met here for an
  important discussion, and presently let each man say what he has to say, but
  in the meantime let us eat and drink. The starved man argues ill."</p>

  <p>The feast was served, but miracles do not happen, and the spirit of
  good-fellowship was not there. The five men ate and drank, and explored the
  stereotyped openings to general conversation. There were gloomy references to
  English politics, to the money rates in different capitals, to the
  stabilisation of the franc, and kindred subjects. Nobody was at his ease;
  everybody had the air of keeping back with difficulty what he really wished
  to say. Doctor Hisedale, after one or two efforts to inaugurate a general
  conversation, confined himself to discussing with the Baron de Brest the
  financial operations of several large German industrial concerns. Mr. Hartley
  K. Wright drank a great deal of wine and every now and then was heard
  muttering to himself. Mr. Huneybell at intervals ate voraciously and drank
  deeply but had also intervals of moody and nervous silence. When the coffee
  was served, the host beckoned the senior of the two waiters towards him.</p>

  <p>"Place the cigars, cigarettes and liqueurs upon the table," he instructed.
  "Kindly see that we are not disturbed. If callers arrive, say that Doctor
  Hisedale is engaged in a business conference."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

  <p>The <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> and his underling took their leave.
  With the closing of the outside door, the atmosphere of tension came to an
  end. Mr. Hartley Wright was first in the field.</p>

  <p>"See here, Doctor," he began, in a crude, unpleasant voice, "and you here,
  Thomas Ryde, let's get down to hard tacks on this. You've sprung a low deal
  on us&mdash;on me, at any rate. I, for one, never expected to be dragged into
  a high-class burglary, with a couple of murders thrown in. Neither did
  Huneybell, neither did Ned Swayles, who's never even handled a gun in his
  life. You're the man I'm talking at, Ryde; you're the man I blame. You made
  out that it was as simple as opening your aunt's workbox to get down there,
  and grab the Boothroyd formula. We all remember what your line of talk
  was&mdash;even if we stopped there was nothing to it. We weren't after money.
  Our lawyers would have pleaded business jealousy, and we should very likely
  have got off altogether. And now, look what you have let us in for."</p>

  <p>"I have let you in for a sixth share of the Boothroyd formula," Ryde said,
  carefully clipping the end of a cigar&mdash;"a property which you could not
  have acquired by any other means."</p>

  <p>"What's the good of a sixth share of anything," Huneybell intervened,
  shivering, "when day and night you think of those two dead men, and slink
  about expecting to be tapped on the shoulder and hauled off to prison?"</p>

  <p>The Baron de Brest scowled across the table.</p>

  <p>"I am entirely in sympathy with our friend from New York," he declared.
  "For a man in my position to have been dragged into a criminal affair like
  this is outrageous. If I had known that a single one of you was carrying a
  revolver that night, I should have gone straight home and had nothing more to
  do with the affair."</p>

  <p>"The trouble of it is," Huneybell pointed out, his voice shaking
  nervously, "that when a party of men are engaged upon a burglarious
  enterprise as we were, if there's a man killed, it don't matter who fires the
  shot. We're all in it together."</p>

  <p>"Let us hope," Doctor Hisedale protested, "that the law does not go so far
  as that. Personally, I shall not allow myself to believe it. I should advise
  you to follow my example&mdash;put all these disconcerting thoughts behind
  and look to the future. Let us act wisely. We are met to come to a good
  decision on this point. We have been led into paying a much greater price
  than we intended for the Boothroyd formula, but the Boothroyd formula is
  after all ours. What are we going to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"I guess you're right, Doctor," the American assented. "This fellow Ryde
  has done us dirt, but what we've met to decide about is how to dispose of the
  booty. What's your idea of its value, now?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Thomas Ryde scribbled on the back of the menu.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you what it is worth," he said. "In eleven years it has
  earned for the firm of Boothroyd profits amounting to twenty-two million
  pounds. That is two million a year. It should be worth five years'
  purchase&mdash;that is ten million. That is what it will be worth to the
  buyer, but we sellers shall never realise half as much. I suggest that we ask
  two million for it, or one million in hard cash."</p>

  <p>The sound of the figures was stimulating. The little company of men began
  to throw off their depression.</p>

  <p>"That's some money!" Mr. Hartley Wright admitted. "But we've got to get
  near to it. Now listen to me," he went on, leaning across the table. "I have
  a suggestion to make. I am well known in Wall Street and close to some of the
  leading financiers in the United States. Give me the formula and let me see
  what I can do. If the offer I am able to cable over isn't satisfactory, if I
  can't get what you think the thing's worth, then one of you others can have a
  try. What I say, though, is that there's no money worth speaking of anywhere
  else except in the States. Give me the formula, and I'll catch Saturday's
  boat."</p>

  <p>Doctor Hisedale pursed out his thick, red lips.</p>

  <p>"I shall say at once," he pronounced, "that without any personal bias I am
  against parting with the formula to any one man."</p>

  <p>"Then how the hell are you going to dispose of it?" Mr. Hartley Wright
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"I know of two manufacturing concerns in Germany," Doctor Hisedale replied
  impressively, "who would combine and buy the Boothroyd formula, provided they
  were convinced that it was genuine."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and what money would you get?" the American sneered. "Listen here,
  boys. We've gone and mixed ourselves up in an ugly business. We need to make
  enough money out of it to keep us in good shape for the rest of our
  lives."</p>

  <p>"That is more than a need; that is a necessity," Doctor Hisedale grunted.
  "But the sooner this is clearly understood the better. No one of us is going
  to dispose of the Boothroyd formula in the way suggested by our friend from
  the States here. No one is going around to make a deal on his own account.
  Business is business," he concluded significantly.</p>

  <p>"If no one's going to trust any one else," the American demanded with
  savage emphasis, "how are we going to dispose of the damned thing at
  all?"</p>

  <p>"Not, under any circumstances, in the way you are suggesting," Thomas Ryde
  intervened, knocking the ash from his cigar, and speaking with cold and
  convincing precision. "I put it to you, gentlemen, that our friend's idea is
  blatant, impossible, and highly dangerous. He forgets that if he approaches
  any financier in the United States during the next fortnight in the manner he
  proposes and endeavours to open a deal for the Boothroyd formula, he will
  probably spend the next night at Police Headquarters, waiting there for a
  report from Scotland Yard."</p>

  <p>There was a brooding silence. The words of the last speaker were
  destructive enough but failed to convey the inspiration for further
  discussion.</p>

  <p>"An American business man doesn't go blabbing his affairs all over the
  place," Hartley Wright ventured.</p>

  <p>"America is the richest country in the world," Mr. Ryde continued calmly,
  "but that does not mean that Americans part with their money more readily
  than any other people. I need not remind you that it is not the millionaire
  who gives the biggest tips, or the richest man who heads the subscription
  list. Furthermore, the New York business men are the shrewdest in the world,
  and I do not believe that one of them would be content to buy a property in
  the dark for the price we shall want for it. You cannot sell the Boothroyd
  formula in that way, nor, I regret to add, would it be wise to attempt to
  take the initiative ourselves towards selling it anywhere at all for the next
  few months."</p>

  <p>Mr. Huneybell's nervous fingers were plunged in his thick crop of black
  hair.</p>

  <p>"After all we've been through," he bewailed, "do you mean that we can do
  nothing but sit still and wait indefinitely?"</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde splashed a little more of the liqueur brandy into his glass
  and swung it round thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"My friends," he expostulated, "you expect things made too easy for you.
  Remember that this is no ordinary division of plunder. I should say that each
  one of us here present possesses at the present moment the equivalent of
  approximately one hundred and seventy thousand pounds. Money like that cannot
  be snatched at."</p>

  <p>"Show me the way to my share," the American groaned.</p>

  <p>"On the other hand," Thomas Ryde went on, ignoring the interruption, "if
  one of us so much as stirs a finger, drops the merest hint as to where the
  Boothroyd formula is to be found, the whole game is up. I am quite aware that
  I am unpopular with every one of you because I took the only possible means
  of carrying through our enterprise successfully. We will not discuss the
  question further. We were out for a <i>coup</i> to make rich men of ourselves
  for the rest of our lives, and when unexpected trouble came, my idea was to
  deal with it in the only way it could be dealt with. I will admit," he
  continued; after smoking thoughtfully for a moment or two, "that it
  complicates the situation to some extent and makes it a little more difficult
  for us to realise our reward. I admit this frankly and I even impress it upon
  you. For the sake of our skins, I suggest to you all most earnestly that not
  one of us approach a single person directly or indirectly with reference to a
  purchase of the Boothroyd formula. Let us be content to wait. Believe me, one
  of two things will happen&mdash;either Boothroyds themselves will offer a
  huge reward for the return of the formula and no questions asked, or some
  other possible buyer&mdash;one of the great continental firms,
  perhaps&mdash;will begin secret enquiries here in London, knowing that the
  formula must be somewhere for sale. It will then be easy enough through a
  trusted third person to get in touch with our market. In plain words,
  gentlemen, let our buyers come to us. Don't let us go to them."</p>

  <p>"And in the meantime we are to starve, I suppose," Huneybell muttered.</p>

  <p>"There is no question of starvation for anybody," Thomas Ryde asserted
  swiftly. "You, Huneybell, for instance, have a very good job as town
  traveller in my small business. I pay you six pounds a week, and if things
  turn out as I expect, in less than a month's time I will be able to pay you
  eight. You are, I think, something like thirty-six years old. Have a little
  patience. Even a year should not be too long for you to wait to be made a
  rich man for the rest of your life.&mdash;You, Doctor Hisedale, are a
  scientist. What your income may be I do not know, but your laboratory at
  Notting Hill is famous, and one presumes that you do not occupy a suite of
  rooms like these on an inadequate income."</p>

  <p>"I do not see what difference that makes," Doctor Hisedale protested. "I
  must live comfortably because it has been my custom, but all the time I need
  money for experiments."</p>

  <p>"We will put it this way then," Thomas Ryde continued. "You are not in
  urgent need. In the cause of safety you can very well afford to wait for
  twelve months.... You, Baron de Brest, are, of course, in a different
  category altogether. You are a wealthy man at any time, and to wait will not
  inconvenience you."</p>

  <p>"You make a great mistake, Mr. Ryde," De Brest assured him eagerly. "It is
  the wealthy man who needs money most. I have my Bank to keep supplied. I have
  profitable business offered to me every day, but business which needs
  money."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," Thomas Ryde rejoined, "you can afford to wait.... As for
  you, Mr. Hartley Wright, I know nothing of your financial position but I
  understand that you have several valuable agencies, and I imagine that you
  are making a very reasonable income. Be content with it for a few months
  longer. Believe me, it is worth while. Even if that unfortunate little
  accident with Rentoul and the watchman had not occurred, it would still have
  been unwise for us to disclose our hand too precipitately. You can be sure,
  as soon as it leaks out that the Boothroyd formula was part of the proceeds
  of that burglary&mdash;and it will leak out before many weeks are
  past&mdash;there isn't one of the great firms in the world who won't be
  trying to get into touch with us."</p>

  <p>There was a depressed and sullen silence. Thomas Ryde was in the unpopular
  position of one who has convinced his companions against their wills.</p>

  <p>"How do you suppose," Doctor Hisedale asked presently, "it will become
  known that the Boothroyd formula has been stolen? The firm themselves are not
  likely to advertise the fact. There hasn't been a word in the papers up till
  now to even suggest such a thing."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde smiled.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you how it will get about," he said. "It will get about
  because Boothroyds will not be able to turn out their goods without the
  formula. The market will become flooded with indifferent material. It won't
  take the commercial world long to find out its source, especially as I have
  the handling of all their wastes and am, in fact, the sole London agent for
  their irregular goods. It certainly won't take the shrewd buyers much longer
  to find out the reason for it."</p>

  <p>"They have a very clever chemist up there," Doctor Hisedale
  meditated&mdash;"a brother-in-law of Rentoul's, I believe he was."</p>

  <p>"They have a very clever man indeed," Ryde agreed, "but remember what I
  told you when I brought you all into this enterprise. Old man
  Boothroyd&mdash;Lord Dutley when he died&mdash;was one of the narrowest and
  most pig-headed old men who ever breathed. He never trusted any one but
  Rentoul. Sir Matthew Parkinson, for instance, the Managing Director of
  Boothroyds to-day, knows no more about the proportions, the chemicals used,
  or any of the finer points of the manufacture than I do. Each department
  works separately, and it was the formula, and the formula only, which brought
  them together. Therefore, they are going to commence now a period of
  experimenting which will cost them millions and whatever measure of success
  they may attain, they will never turn out the Boothroyd art silks in the
  proper style until they get the formula back."</p>

  <p>There was a brief interlude of disjointed remarks, staccato-like
  exclamations piercing the blanket of an uneasy silence. De Brest moved to the
  sideboard, and came back with a cigar in his mouth.</p>

  <p>"I do not like this business of waiting," he declared, "any more than the
  rest of you, but I think that there is much common sense in what Mr. Ryde has
  said. One has the stock markets, too," he added. "There should be money to be
  made there. We might arrange a pool to 'bear' the shares."</p>

  <p>"Ryde may know what he's talking about," Hartley Wright acknowledged
  glumly, "but there's one point he hasn't touched upon which seems to me
  pretty important. You want us to wait for three, or even six months, Ryde?
  Who the hell's going to take charge of the formula for that time?"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Mr. Ryde murmured. "I imagined we would come to that."</p>

  <p>"You bet," was the terse rejoinder. "You don't trust me; I don't trust
  you. I want to know what you're going to do with the formula before I stir
  out of this burg."</p>

  <p>"The packet has been quite safe with me during the last ten days," Thomas
  Ryde pointed out.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but you don't suppose we've been trusting you, do you?" the other
  snarled. "You must think we're some sort of mugs. It's cost us a fiver each a
  week to have you shadowed&mdash;but we've done it&mdash;Hisedale, the Baron
  and I between us. We've had a private bull lagging you since the day we
  arrived in London. You can put that in your pipe and smoke it. We're no more
  willing to trust you than you are to trust us. Now what are you going to do
  about it?"</p>

  <p>"There is an old-fashioned way," Thomas Ryde suggested gently, his hands
  seeming to linger about his pocket, "of settling such a matter. The formula
  is in my possession at the present moment. Would you like to fight for
  it?"</p>

  <p>A tense and ugly silence ensued. Thomas Ryde's chair was a little
  withdrawn from the table, and from behind his gold-rimmed spectacles, his
  eyes shone like diamonds. Perhaps none of the four men were utter cowards but
  there was not one of them to whom there did not come at that moment a little
  thrill of horrified memory, whose spine did not run cold at the thought of
  that still, emotionless figure dealing out death twice within the space of a
  few minutes with quiet and dexterous brutality.</p>

  <p>"Damned silly line of talk that," Hartley Wright grumbled.</p>

  <p>"It is not necessary for us to quarrel," De Brest insisted. "There is
  enough for all of us."</p>

  <p>"Exactly my view," Thomas Ryde affirmed, in his even, penetrating tone.
  "You say that you have had me watched. You haven't, during these last ten
  days, noticed that I have been paying visits to financiers or
  manufacturers?"</p>

  <p>"No one is accusing you of that, or anything else," Doctor Hisedale
  declared, in the voice of a would-be pacificator. "Your movements have been
  perfectly regular. At the same time, I must admit that the question of the
  disposal of the formula presents to me, as to my friend Mr. Hartley Wright,
  difficulties&mdash;very considerable difficulties. Many honest men have been
  tempted by the prospect of becoming a millionaire."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he agreed, "let us accept the principle of mutual distrust.
  Meet me at two o'clock to-morrow afternoon in the smoke room of the Cannon
  Street Hotel, and I will put before you a plan for the safe custody of the
  formula which I think will be satisfactory to every one. At two o'clock in
  the smoke room of the Cannon Street Hotel."</p>

  <p>"We'll hear the scheme at any rate," Hartley Wright conceded grudgingly.
  "I don't pledge my word to consent to it."</p>

  <p>"You'll consent to whatever the others agree to," was the curt retort.
  "Gentlemen, I live some distance out and I am not accustomed to late hours. I
  shall take my leave. Doctor Hisedale, I thank you for your hospitality. In
  this atmosphere of mutual suspicion, to shake hands would be hypocrisy. Until
  two o'clock to-morrow in the smoke room of the Cannon Street Hotel."</p>

  <p>With which Mr. Thomas Ryde, unruffled and tranquil, took his leave. The
  banquet was at an end.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ON the afternoon following Doctor Hisedale's somewhat
  peculiar dinner party at the Milan Hotel, Mr. Henry Hogg, Manager of the
  International Safe Deposit Company, Queen Victoria Street, returned from his
  luncheon just before half-past two, entered his office by the private way,
  and rang for his secretary.</p>

  <p>"Any callers or telephone messages, Skinner?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"There are five gentlemen waiting to see you, sir," the young man
  announced.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hogg was somewhat startled. Five prospective clients so early in the
  afternoon was, to say the least of it, unusual.</p>

  <p>"Send them here," he directed, "in the order of their arrival."</p>

  <p>"They all came together, sir."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hogg was more surprised than ever. He leaned back in his chair and
  looked at his secretary over the top of his <i>pince-nez</i>.</p>

  <p>"What sort of people are they?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>The young man appeared vague. The answer to the question required a little
  more imagination than he possessed.</p>

  <p>"Ordinary city gentlemen, they might be, sir," he reported. "One of them
  has the look of an artist. He is untidy about the head and kind of nervous in
  his manner, and I should say another was an American."</p>

  <p>"Well, show them in," Mr. Hogg enjoined&mdash;"that is, if they all want
  to come in."</p>

  <p>"I rather fancy that they do, sir," his subordinate confided. "They are
  all sitting close together and once, when the bell rang, they all got up. It
  seems as though they don't want to lose sight of one another."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hogg, considerably intrigued, waved his secretary towards the door,
  drew the plan of vacant safes towards him, and settled himself down in his
  chair. Presently there were footsteps outside and the door was thrown
  open.</p>

  <p>"The five gentlemen, sir," Skinner announced.</p>

  <p>They filed in one by one, and from the first, they gave Mr. Hogg the idea
  of men who were filled with distrust of one another. Doctor Hisedale led the
  way. Mr. Thomas Ryde, with a small packet under his arm, came next; flanking
  him were Mr. Huneybell and Mr. Hartley Wright; and bringing up the rear was
  De Brest, half a head taller than any one of them.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," the Manager of the International Safe Deposit Company said,
  rising to his feet, "I understand that you wish to see me on business. I am
  sorry that I have not five chairs to offer you. Will you kindly dispose of
  yourselves as well as you can. What can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Thomas Ryde disclosed himself as spokesman. He adjusted his
  gold-rimmed spectacles firmly upon his nose, selected the most comfortable
  chair, and crossed his neatly trousered legs.</p>

  <p>"We are sorry to inflict such a visitation upon you, sir," he apologised,
  "but the fact of it is that we are all equally interested in the business
  which has brought us here. Unfortunately, too, we all appear to be inspired
  with a profound mistrust of one another. That is the reason why we are all
  surrounding your desk. My name is Thomas Ryde. The gentleman on my right is
  Doctor Hisedale, whose name is probably known to you. Doctor Hisedale is a
  very celebrated scientist. Next to him is Mr. Huneybell, my assistant in a
  small business. Behind him, the Baron Sigismund de Brest, the well known
  Dutch banker and financier, and the gentleman beyond, who has seated himself
  between me and the door, is Mr. Hartley K. Wright."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hogg acknowledged the introductions in courteous fashion.</p>

  <p>"If, as you say, you are here on business," he observed, "am I to
  understand that you all wish to rent a safe?"</p>

  <p>"We require only one," Mr. Ryde replied&mdash;"the strongest and best that
  you are able to offer us."</p>

  <p>The Manager smiled indulgently.</p>

  <p>"You probably know all about us," he said. "We are the one company in the
  world who is able to offer its clients perfect security. Our safes are all
  precisely the same, and any one of them is better than the safe of any other
  make in the world. There is no power on earth which nature or science has yet
  evolved which could open one of them when it is finally closed. They are, to
  be brief, invulnerable. Our system of watchmen, robot and human, our electric
  alarms&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Quite so," Mr. Ryde interrupted politely. "We have considered your
  announcements and your specifications, and we are all agreed that you are
  able to offer perfect security. Our trouble, however, which I shall presently
  disclose, lies in another direction. Let me first, if I may, ask you a
  question. Is it necessary to divulge the nature of any packet we leave with
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," Mr. Hogg assured him. "The only thing concerning which
  I must satisfy myself is that its contents are not of an explosive
  character."</p>

  <p>"It will be necessary to open the package to decide that&mdash;" Doctor
  Hisedale intervened.</p>

  <p>"Not at all. I can decide by the weight."</p>

  <p>"Very well then," Thomas Ryde continued. "Here is our difficulty. We have,
  with one other, whom you have not seen, and to whom we will allude as Mr. X.,
  become partners in a certain enterprise. We are almost strangers to one
  another, for the enterprise demanded varied gifts. Hence our little
  association. We succeeded. The treasure of which we have become possessed is
  worth a fortune to each one, but it is not immediately realisable. A key to
  the fortune lies in the package which I am embracing&mdash;a fact which you
  have doubtless already surmised."</p>

  <p>"It seemed to me highly probable," Mr. Hogg admitted.</p>

  <p>"Do not think too hardly of us, sir, but the result of our labours is
  worth a million pounds, taking it at a very low valuation. Now, I ask you, is
  this mutual mistrust altogether inexplicable? Are there any four or five
  average men who could be brought together in any walk of life who would be
  willing to trust each other for the sixth part of a million pounds? I put the
  question to you for your consideration."</p>

  <p>"I see your point," the other murmured. "To put it baldly, you can't make
  up your minds who is to be trusted with the key."</p>

  <p>"You are amazingly right," was the prompt assent.</p>

  <p>"You could each have a key if you liked," was Mr. Hogg's tentative
  suggestion.</p>

  <p>A little ripple of mirth, half cynical, half genuine, flickered across the
  five intent faces.</p>

  <p>"Which of us, do you fancy, sir," Thomas Ryde asked, "would sleep
  peacefully in his bed with the full knowledge that four others possessed the
  key to our treasure chamber, and that even at that moment the safe might be
  empty? We are human beings, Mr. Hogg, and we have already spoken of our
  mistrust of one another. Your suggestion does nothing to solve our
  difficulty."</p>

  <p>"Have you thought out any way of dealing with it yourselves?"</p>

  <p>"Roughly, this is my idea," Thomas Ryde explained, taking a sheet of
  business note paper from a rack upon the table. "You give us a formal receipt
  for our deposit, and hold the key of the safe here yourself. The receipt then
  should be torn into six pieces, two of which come to me&mdash;one for Mr. X.
  and one for myself&mdash;my friends here take the other four, and you should
  deliver up the key only when the receipt <i>in toto</i>, pasted together, or
  still in pieces, should be handed to you in its entirety."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hogg deliberated for a few moments.</p>

  <p>"It would not be necessary then for all of you to present the portions of
  the receipt in person?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," Thomas Ryde replied. "Circumstances might, in any case,
  render that impracticable. One of us might be dead, in the hospital,
  or&mdash;er&mdash;in any other form of confinement. The only point, so far as
  you are concerned, is that the six original fragments of paper must be
  produced and recognised by you as constituting the original receipt. You then
  hand over the key, and your responsibilities are at an end."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hogg leaned back in his chair and dangled his <i>pince-nez</i> by its
  cord. He had already made up his mind that the contents of the package
  probably consisted of spurious bank notes, or of jewelry forming the proceeds
  of some cunningly devised burglary. His own responsibilities in the matter,
  however, were not onerous and the letting of a safe was not an everyday
  affair.</p>

  <p>"This is the most unique proposition which has ever been made to me," he
  confided. "I should like to know a little more about you, gentleman. A packet
  worth a million pounds is no light charge."</p>

  <p>"On behalf of myself and my associates," Thomas Ryde admitted, "I will be
  frank. We are a company of adventurers."</p>

  <p>There was a murmur of irritated and angry dissent, which the
  self-appointed confessor ignored.</p>

  <p>"But," he continued, "more or less honest adventurers. We have risked
  everything we have in the world to obtain the contents of that package. My
  name, as I have told you, is Thomas Ryde. I have a commission agent's
  business in connection with the sale of yarns and artificial silks near
  Moorgate Street Station. I also consider myself an expert accountant, and I
  have been engaged at various times to conduct a campaign of economy in the
  office departments of certain firms whose expenses have been out of
  proportion to their profits. Mr. Huneybell, the gentleman on my left, who
  obstinately refuses the ministrations of a barber, is my clerk and town
  traveller in the business to which I first alluded. Doctor Hisedale is a
  famous scientist who is over here making a few final experiments in a London
  laboratory before he joins a firm of German manufacturers. Mr. Hartley Wright
  here is an American man of affairs of good standing. Finally, there is the
  Baron de Brest, whose name and position in the banking world should be
  sufficient guarantee for us. We are not men of straw, Mr. Hogg."</p>

  <p>"Can I see the package?" that gentleman enquired.</p>

  <p>His friends formed a little semicircle round Thomas Ryde as he deposited
  his burden, wrapped in brown paper and sealed in many places, upon the table.
  Mr. Hogg felt the weight of it speculatively and listened for a moment. It
  was not nearly heavy enough for an infernal machine and, so far as he could
  gather, contained nothing but papers. He decided that his first surmise with
  regard to its contents was correct.</p>

  <p>"Very well, gentlemen," he agreed. "Our charge for the rent of a safe for
  three months&mdash;we do not let them for a shorter period&mdash;will be
  fifty pounds. If you will hand over the money, I will prepare you the
  official receipt."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde produced ten five-pound notes, made a memorandum of the
  disbursement in his diary, and glanced through the document approvingly. He
  then laid it upon the table and rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I shall now ask this last service of you, sir," he said. "Tear that
  sheet, if you please, into six pieces. Give me two and every one else
  one."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hogg occupied himself in the manner desired, placed each fragment of
  the mutilated receipt in an envelope, and handed them over.</p>

  <p>"I don't mind admitting," he said good-humouredly, "that I have had some
  strange clients, but I think you gentlemen are the strangest of all. If you
  will follow me, we will now deposit your treasure."</p>

  <p>He touched a bell, and, escorted by a couple of burly-looking officials,
  who had more the appearance of prison warders than custodians of a civil
  undertaking, the five men were piloted to the subterranean quarters of the
  building. They passed through door after door of solid steel, each with a
  different type of lock, until they found themselves in a square apartment,
  even the floor of which was of some tempered metal. The safes were built into
  the wall all around and each had a number in luminous letters painted above
  it. Mr. Hogg paused before number 14 and inserted the key in a small
  lock.</p>

  <p>"Listen, gentlemen," he enjoined, looking around.</p>

  <p>He turned the key once. There was a hideous jangling of bells.</p>

  <p>"At the present moment," he continued, standing with the key still in his
  hand, "a purple light is showing in the main office and in my own room. Now
  once more."</p>

  <p>He turned the key again. The bells ceased, but a long, shrill whistle rang
  through the whole place. The door of the safe opened, the packet was
  deposited, and pandemonium ceased.</p>

  <p>"You may rest convinced now, gentlemen," Mr. Hogg assured them, as he led
  the way to the lift, "that your million-pound deposit is as safe as human
  beings can make it."</p>

  <p>He escorted his unusual clients to the light of day and watched them
  linger for a moment upon the threshold of the entrance hall. They were
  apparently men of unusual habits, for they indulged in no form of
  leave-taking, but all melted away in different directions. Mr. Ryde hailed a
  passing taxicab, and the Baron followed his example. Huneybell joined a
  little group who were waiting at the next corner for a bus. Doctor Hisedale,
  after a few seconds' hesitation, proceeded on foot towards the Embankment.
  Mr. Hartley K. Wright lurched steadily towards the City. The partnership was
  momentarily dissolved. Each member of it breathed a trifle more freely when
  he thought of that roll of papers reposing in the grim inaccessibility of
  Safe Deposit Box number 14.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CHARLES PHILIP BOOTHROYD, second Baron Dutley, still
  odoriferous of bath salts and shaving soap, fresh from the careful hands of
  his valet, left his dressing room, descended the curving stairway of his
  pleasant little bachelor Mayfair residence, and entered the library where his
  recently announced visitor was awaiting him.</p>

  <p>"Awfully sorry to keep you waiting, Sir Matthew," he apologised. "I didn't
  get back from the Club until eight&mdash;just before you arrived, as a matter
  of fact&mdash;and one always meets such a lot of fellows when one's been
  away&mdash;pretty well a year, too, this time."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew Parkinson shook hands but made no immediate reply. Pleasantly
  large though the room was, it seemed almost cramped when he loomed up from
  his place, a towering, dignified figure, somehow portentous notwithstanding
  his forced smile of welcome. He was a tall, broad-shouldered Yorkshireman,
  six feet four at least in height, erect, with a broad, benevolent face,
  little patches of side whiskers, black streaked with grey, and a mouth which
  had puzzled every physiognomist who had studied it. "A fine-looking man",
  they called him in Leeds and all through the county, as indeed he was. At the
  head of his dining table, on the back of a hunter, presiding in the Board
  Room of Boothroyds over a meeting of his fellow directors, at any of those
  public functions to which duty continually took him, every one realised that
  Sir Matthew Parkinson upheld with dignity and distinction the great position
  which he had attained as head of the famous house of Boothroyd. It was true
  that Charles, the son of old Boothroyd, who had been raised to the peerage in
  the last year of his life, was still the titular Chairman of the Company, but
  it was Sir Matthew who was the life and soul of the firm. Dutley was an
  athlete himself, but by the side of his visitor he seemed almost
  insignificant in stature and weak in physiognomy.</p>

  <p>"What will you have?" the latter demanded hospitably, with his finger upon
  the bell. "I'm terribly sorry to have to push off, but I'd no idea you were
  in town, and I have to be in Grosvenor Street in a few minutes. As a matter
  of fact, I've scarcely seen my fianc&eacute;e yet and I'm dining there
  to-night."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew looked a little dazed. It was obvious that he had expected a
  different sort of reception.</p>

  <p>"I will drink a glass of sherry," he rejoined, "and I will be as brief as
  possible. Nevertheless, it is serious business we have to discuss&mdash;and
  not business to be hurried over either."</p>

  <p>A footman entered, to whom Dutley gave an order. Then he helped himself to
  a cigarette, pushed the box towards his visitor, and leaned against the
  mantelpiece.</p>

  <p>"How's Grace?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"Grace is well enough. Discontented as usual, but all young people seem to
  be getting that way nowadays. She sent you the usual messages."</p>

  <p>"And what's this serious business that you want to talk about?" Dutley
  asked, with a grimace.</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew looked at his host reprovingly.</p>

  <p>"Have you by chance looked at any of the letters I have written you since
  July?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Dutley was promptly apologetic.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth, Sir Matthew," he confessed, "I haven't. When I
  left Abyssinia, which was in March, I wasn't at all sure how long it would
  take me to get clear of the country, or how I should come home. It depended
  what sort of a steamer I could catch, and it was just on the cards I might
  have had to go up to Khartoum to make some plans for next winter. We had a
  lot of sickness amongst the boys, too, crossing the desert, and that always
  throws you back. Anyhow, I sent home to say that they'd better hold all the
  letters. They'd only have missed me if they'd tried sending them on."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew was aghast.</p>

  <p>"Great heavens!" he exclaimed. "Do you really mean to tell me that you
  haven't read a letter of mine for months?"</p>

  <p>The young man pointed a little guiltily to the library table, upon which
  was stacked a huge pile of unopened correspondence.</p>

  <p>"There they all are," he declared cheerfully. "Sorry if I've made a
  bloomer, but supposing I had read them, what difference could it make? If
  you've asked my advice about anything, my opinion wouldn't be worth a snap of
  the fingers. I'm only a figurehead in the concern anyway."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence, which even to Dutley seemed pregnant with
  sinister meaning. A log of wood broke off from the fire in the open grate.
  Taxicabs were all the time honking by. London seemed alive to the fact that
  this was the pleasant hour before dinner. The cocktails and sherry arrived
  and were duly served. Sir Matthew watched his glass filled but made no
  movement towards it. Dutley, on the other hand, drank off his cocktail and
  replenished his glass. The servants left the room.</p>

  <p>"Come on," the younger man begged, with a glance at the clock. "Let's hear
  the worst."</p>

  <p>"It is probably news to you," Sir Matthew confided slowly, "that there was
  a burglary at the Works three months ago."</p>

  <p>"Heard something about it this afternoon," Dutley acknowledged. "The
  fellows at the Club were chaffing&mdash;seemed surprised that I could afford
  to buy them a drink. Got away with five thousand quid, didn't they?"</p>

  <p>"They got away also," was the grave reply, "with something of far greater
  importance. They murdered poor old Rentoul, who was the only one of his
  chemists whom your father ever trusted, and they got away with Blunn's
  formula."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry about poor old Rentoul," Dutley said. "I remember the old boy
  quite well. What's Blunn's formula, though? It sounds familiar, but I can't
  exactly place it."</p>

  <p>"It is the formula for the manufacture of artificial silk," Sir Matthew
  declared solemnly, "upon which your father built up the whole of his
  business&mdash;the formula which is responsible for the fortunes of the House
  of Boothroyd."</p>

  <p>"The devil!" Dutley exclaimed, a little startled.</p>

  <p>"The five or six thousand pounds," Sir Matthew went on, "wasn't worth
  thinking about. It didn't matter a snap of the fingers. The theft of those
  papers is nothing more nor less than a colossal disaster to the firm."</p>

  <p>"But what on earth use is the formula to a gang of burglars?" Dutley
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"They weren't ordinary burglars," was the portentous explanation. "It is
  my conviction that they came for the formula, and for nothing else. If they
  had been ordinary burglars, the Police would probably have had them before
  now. As it is, they haven't a single clue to work upon."</p>

  <p>"Rotten!" Dutley murmured. "How are you getting on at the Works without
  the formula?"</p>

  <p>"We aren't getting on," Sir Matthew groaned. "That's our trouble, as
  you'll find out when you read my letters. You'll have to try to grasp the
  situation, young man. It's serious enough, I can tell you. Your father,
  although I say it to his son, was one of the most obstinate men who ever
  breathed. He built up great works here and in Switzerland, in Germany and in
  France, in Italy, on the strength of a single extremely complicated formula.
  On the day of his death?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I remember that," Dutley interrupted, with a covert glance towards
  the clock. "He called you in, and me, and Stephenson, and Watherspoon. We all
  promised that the formula should be kept in the safe, and never copied."</p>

  <p>"And we kept our word, worse luck!" Sir Matthew regretted bitterly. "Now
  we are paying for humouring a dying man's whim. Without the formula, we have
  been hopelessly at sea. Fortunately it doesn't matter quite so much abroad
  where we are mostly making by-products. Up in Marlingthorpe we're in the hell
  of a mess. We have been manufacturing on guesswork, and guessing wrong all
  the time. Our chemists have been working night and day. We've spent thousands
  on experiments and we're no nearer the real thing. Making silk indeed! We're
  making muck. We're nowhere near the right thing. Do you know what our shares
  stand at in the market to-day?"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I do," the young man rejoined. "The Stock Exchange
  news came up when I was waiting on the tape to see whether Reggie Fulford had
  won the Guards' Steeplechase. About eighty, aren't they?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, somewhere about that. Do you know what they're worth?"</p>

  <p>"Don't know that I do," Dutley admitted. "Those Stock Exchange fellows
  generally hit it off about right though, don't they?"</p>

  <p>"If the world knew the truth," Sir Matthew confided impressively, "they're
  worth somewhere about forty, and at that they'd be a speculation. I wouldn't
  buy them myself at the price."</p>

  <p>All the light-hearted good nature faded from Charles Dutley's face. He set
  down his glass and stared at the speaker. There was no doubt about Sir
  Matthew's being in earnest. The fist of his great right hand was clenched so
  tightly that the veins stood out in deep blue cords as he banged the arm of
  his chair. In his excitement, the Yorkshire accent of his youth forced its
  way to the surface.</p>

  <p>"Listen, lad," he continued, "we've sent out already five hundred thousand
  pounds' worth of rotten stock, and God knows the trouble it's going to lead
  us into. We've five hundred thousand pounds' worth more in the warehouse, and
  at the present moment our machinery, which is running at a cost of over five
  thousand pounds a day, is turning out material which, instead of being fit to
  sell at a fifteen to twenty per cent. profit is only fit for the
  cesspool."</p>

  <p>There was another silence. Sir Matthew was breathing heavily. He took out
  his lavender-scented white cambric handkerchief and wiped his forehead. A
  pale streak had crept into Dutley's cheeks underneath the dark coat of
  sunburn. The words were there still, lingering in the air, words of hideous
  import, which might spell approaching ruin.</p>

  <p>"My God, Sir Matthew," he exclaimed, "and I hadn't an idea!"</p>

  <p>"How the hell could you have," Sir Matthew pointed out, "if you go and
  bury yourself in these outlandish countries, shooting animals which have
  never done you any harm, and never even taking the trouble to have your
  letters sent after you? What did it matter to you? You've been content with
  your princely income and your life of sport. Old Stephenson's on a trip round
  the world. Watherspoon is past his job, and all the time I've had to bear
  this alone. Every morning I've had to inspect the muck that's come out of the
  Works and pretend it's all right."</p>

  <p>"Are there any signs," Dutley enquired, "of any one else having got hold
  of the formula?"</p>

  <p>"That's the first sensible question you've asked," was the gruff response.
  "We've lost in round figures pretty well half a million in making filthy
  stock since the formula went, but there's no other firm that I can hear of
  who's improved its manufacture, or who's making the stuff we used to make.
  That's where there's a gleam of hope for us. We've got to get the formula
  back even if we pay for it."</p>

  <p>"Why not offer a big reward?" Dutley suggested.</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew scoffed.</p>

  <p>"Ask the Police," he rejoined. "Any one who can lay his hands on that
  formula is likely enough to stand his trial for murder. Besides, we've
  managed to keep the thing secret so far. If the merest rumour of it gets
  round the Stock Exchange there'll be such a slump in Boothroyds as the City
  has never seen."</p>

  <p>There was a discreet knock at the door. A servant presented himself.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ronald Bessiter has telephoned from Grosvenor Street, my lord. I was
  to remind you that they were expecting you there for dinner. It's already
  twenty minutes to nine."</p>

  <p>Dutley nodded, and dismissed the man.</p>

  <p>"When can I see you to-morrow, Sir Matthew?" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"As early as possible. I don't suppose you can help any more than any
  other man could, but I must have some one to share the responsibility. What
  about quite early&mdash;say eight o'clock?"</p>

  <p>"Suit me all right," Dutley assented. "Come round here and have a spot of
  bacon and eggs. I'm sorry to have to hurry away. I'd cancel the dinner, only
  it's with my prospective father-in-law, and I expect I shall get it in the
  neck as it is. Burdett will look after you&mdash;get you another glass of
  sherry if you'll have it."</p>

  <p>The young man took swift leave of his visitor, and Sir Matthew rose
  heavily to his feet. He lingered for a moment on his way to the door, his
  eyes fixed upon that enormous, still unopened heap of correspondence. He was
  by no means a visionary, but there seemed to him something a little
  allegorical in that sublime indifference to passing events which such an
  accumulated mass denoted. He thought of old Boothroyd, seated at his desk at
  half-past eight every morning, an envelope opener in his hand.
  One&mdash;two&mdash;three. Private letters on the left, business letters on
  the right, envelopes and circular appeals into the waste-paper basket.... The
  butler entered the room quietly.</p>

  <p>"I have called a taxi for you, Sir Matthew," he announced. "May I offer
  you another glass of sherry?"</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew pulled himself together.</p>

  <p>"No thanks. Tell his lordship that I shall be here punctually at eight
  o'clock to-morrow morning," he said, as he took his departure.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"WHAT made you so late, Charles?" Lucille Bessiter asked her
  fianc&eacute;, as he sat on the arm of her chair about a quarter of an hour
  later.</p>

  <p>"A man I simply couldn't send away came to see me at the last moment," he
  explained&mdash;"old Sir Matthew Parkinson who runs our show up in Yorkshire.
  I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid your mother's angry with me."</p>

  <p>"She'll get over it," Lucille predicted. "I didn't know they ever bothered
  you about the business."</p>

  <p>"They don't, as a rule," he admitted. "This was something rather
  exceptional. I say, who is the tall young fellow, looks like a foreigner, who
  was talking to you so earnestly when I came in? He's been glowering at me
  ever since."</p>

  <p>"That is a very important person," she confided. "His name is the Baron de
  Brest, and he's a Dutch financier and banker. He's a client of the firm, or
  going to become one."</p>

  <p>"Is he?" Dutley muttered. "Well, I don't like the fellow."</p>

  <p>Lucille arched her fine eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Why, you don't know him!"</p>

  <p>"And I hope I never shall."</p>

  <p>The girl laughed, but her frown deepened a little.</p>

  <p>"You certainly will," she said. "During your extremely protracted and
  tactless absence, he has been my chief consoler."</p>

  <p>"Well, he's out of a job," Dutley declared.</p>

  <p>Lucille eyed her fianc&eacute; speculatively.</p>

  <p>"You take a good deal for granted."</p>

  <p>"Too much?"</p>

  <p>"That depends. What are you doing to-morrow morning?"</p>

  <p>He indulged in a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"Interviewing Sir Matthew, and opening my letters."</p>

  <p>"I'll come and go through them for you," she promised. "I've always
  wondered what the correspondence of a millionaire was like."</p>

  <p>"I'm not quite so sure that Charles is a millionaire," her brother, a very
  smart young man and a shining light on the Stock Exchange, remarked. "His
  shares dropped a quarter this afternoon, and finished weak. You will probably
  read to-morrow morning in the financial column of the <i>Times</i> that it
  was due to profit-taking, but one never knows. They may have heard that
  you're back, Charles, and that you're thinking of going into the
  business."</p>

  <p>"If I should consider doing such a thing," Dutley observed, with dignity,
  "there would probably be a boom in the shares, not a fall. I don't think,
  Lucille," he complained, "that your family supports my interests strongly
  enough."</p>

  <p>"Can't say that for the head of the firm," Mr. Bessiter remarked, from the
  other end of the room. "There was a little chap, an occasional client of
  ours, in a few days ago, talked of opening a 'bear' account against
  Boothroyds from the first of the month. I strongly advised him to do nothing
  of the sort&mdash;told him, in fact, we wouldn't consider it on a margin. He
  left without doing business. That's what I call supporting the credit of the
  family."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bessiter, good-hearted, charming, a very distinguished figure in her
  world, and a very popular woman, broke off in her conversation with a
  well-known diplomat.</p>

  <p>"I'm not quite sure about Charles ever belonging to the family," she
  intervened. "These long absences in barbarous countries are very dangerous
  things. I think that Lucille is becoming dissatisfied, and I am not sure that
  I blame her. I am quite convinced, although she is my own daughter, that she
  is the sort of girl who requires a stay-at-home fianc&eacute;."</p>

  <p>"Lucky for me, I've often thought," her husband reflected, "that I was a
  home bird myself."</p>

  <p>"A most uncalled-for speech," was his wife's severe retort. "If I go to
  Cannes, even for a month, I come back in three weeks."</p>

  <p>The announcement of dinner interrupted the badinage. Dutley found himself
  between his fianc&eacute;e, and a grave-faced, bespectacled, elderly
  gentleman, whose name he had not caught.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't get my numbers right to-night," Mrs. Bessiter apologised, from
  the end of the table. "Anyway, I thought that Charles, if he had the faintest
  sense of duty, would neglect his other neighbour to talk to Lucille, so I
  didn't worry about getting another woman."</p>

  <p>"I regret," the elderly gentleman said, with a courteous inclination of
  the head, "that I am to be neglected, because I find much pleasure and
  interest in meeting Lord Dutley. I am, in a sense, a competitor of your
  firm's," he added.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" Dutley murmured politely. "I am afraid I didn't catch your
  name."</p>

  <p>"My name is Hisedale&mdash;Doctor Hisedale. I am connected with the German
  company of Meyers of Offenbach. Just now, however, I am over here to make
  experiments at a friend's laboratory. Yours is the envied firm of the world,
  Lord Dutley."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that I don't know as much about it as I ought to," was the
  frank reply. "I only went into the business for a year or two. I chucked it
  for the war, and never went back again."</p>

  <p>"You are still Managing Director, though, I understand."</p>

  <p>"Well, I am Chairman of the Directors," Dutley acknowledged. "That is
  simply because of my holding of shares. I turn up once a year, and address
  the shareholders."</p>

  <p>"Amidst scenes of wild excitement," Lucille put in, "when the dividend is
  large enough. When it isn't, they boo."</p>

  <p>"Boothroyds' dividend," Doctor Hisedale said, with a smile, "is usually
  large enough to satisfy the most exacting shareholder. We look upon your
  people, sir," he continued, "as the most favoured in the world. You&mdash;or
  rather the chemists whom your illustrious father was clever enough to
  discover&mdash;have inaugurated a new industry. We all grope in the darkness
  whilst you triumph."</p>

  <p>Dutley sipped his champagne. It seemed an odd co-incidence that he should
  have a conversation of this sort forced upon him.</p>

  <p>"I wish I knew more about it," he confessed. "You should come up and have
  a look at our Works, and meet Sir Matthew Parkinson, Doctor."</p>

  <p>The latter smiled&mdash;a thin smile of derision.</p>

  <p>"I have met your Sir Matthew Parkinson," he confided. "I do not fancy that
  if I visited your Works I should learn very much. He is one of those
  magnificent Yorkshiremen who knows how to keep his mouth very tightly closed.
  Indeed, why not? In Germany we work, too, with locked doors. The preservation
  of our secrets is the measure of our commercial success."</p>

  <p>Lucille leaned forward with a little pout.</p>

  <p>"Do you know that you are poaching, Doctor Hisedale?" she complained.
  "This is my fianc&eacute;, whom I have not seen for many months until this
  morning."</p>

  <p>"I apologise," the scientist said solemnly, turning to his neighbour on
  the other side. "You will take pity on me, Mrs. Saunderson. You will tell me
  what theatres a foreigner who has not many friends in England should
  visit."</p>

  <p>Lucille laughed softly up at her companion.</p>

  <p>"Poor dear!" she murmured. "How all this talk of business does bore you,
  doesn't it? And what a good thing it is you don't have to earn your own
  living."</p>

  <p>"Supposing I had to," he speculated.</p>

  <p>"You may have some gift for stuffing wild animals. They tell me that is
  quite a profession. Or perhaps, if you are as good with a shotgun as they say
  you are with a rifle, you could earn a little by going about to country
  houses in the season, shooting their game for them. Otherwise, old dear, I'm
  afraid your chances would be a little vague. Passionately attached though I
  am to you, I am not at all sure that I would entrust myself, with my love of
  creature comforts, to your efforts."</p>

  <p>Dutley laid down his knife and fork.</p>

  <p>"I knew it," he groaned. "You're marrying me for my money."</p>

  <p>"Of course I'm marrying you for your money," she agreed. "You'll never be
  able to take care of it unless you have some one like me to do it for you.
  Nevertheless, it may have occurred to you sometimes, in your moments of
  bloated arrogance, that I am rather well off myself."</p>

  <p>"That is good news," he declared. "I sha'n't have to make you an
  allowance, or settlements, or anything of that sort."</p>

  <p>"Oh, won't you?" she scoffed. "Dad will see to that, I can promise you.
  Dad, how much do you think Charles ought to settle on me? We thought of going
  in to see the lawyers together next week."</p>

  <p>Mr. Bessiter knew his daughter well, but he was a man of some dignity,
  with the gift of reticence, and he was a little shocked.</p>

  <p>"These things, my dear," he told her, "are not discussed at even a
  friendly dinner table."</p>

  <p>"Snubbed," she sighed, under her breath. "Nevertheless, I warn you, that I
  shall insist upon settlements."</p>

  <p>"We'll go into it and see how much I have to settle," Dutley promised her.
  "I don't like that little chap going to your father's office and wanting to
  open a 'bear' account against us. My knowledge of Stock Exchange affairs is
  limited, but I imagine that he's laying the odds against our prosperity, or
  something of the sort."</p>

  <p>"Admirably put," Baron de Brest declared, from the other side of the
  table, with a little bow. "Lord Dutley will end by being a business man, I am
  sure."</p>

  <p>Doctor Hisedale's florid eyebrows were slightly contracted.</p>

  <p>"Did I understand," he asked, "that some man has been imprudent enough to
  suggest opening a 'bear' account against Boothroyds?"</p>

  <p>"Happened only a few days ago," Dutley assured him. "What with that, and
  the quarter drop in my shares, owing to profit-taking, whatever that may
  mean, I am not sure that I shall be able to afford to get married this
  year."</p>

  <p>"We get married before Christmas," Lucille said firmly, "or not at all. I
  have arrived at that dangerous age between flapperdom and young womanhood
  when I need a guiding hand, constant attentions, and flowers every morning. A
  lover in Abyssinia is not of the slightest use to me."</p>

  <p>"Almost as bad," her mother mused, "as a husband who is in the City all
  day."</p>

  <p>"How modern our elders get!" Lucille sighed.</p>

  <p>"Baron," Mrs. Bessiter continued, with a glance at the frown on his face,
  "I really am afraid that you must be shocked at my daughter's levity. When
  you discuss us in your own country, please don't believe that all our young
  women are like this. They are not, I can assure you. Lucille was always,
  unfortunately, brought up with her brothers, and you know what that
  means&mdash;either a touch of the hoyden, or a step in front of her
  generation."</p>

  <p>"Something ought to be done about Mother," Lucille declared.</p>

  <p>It was a pleasant household, intimate conversation, personalities freely
  indulged in all the time without possibility of offence. By degrees, Dutley
  forgot that disquieting half an hour earlier in the evening, and felt himself
  for the first time really at home again. Only two trifling circumstances were
  faint sources of annoyance to him. The first was that De Brest, from across
  the table, scarcely once removed his eyes from Lucille, and was always
  chipping into the conversation when possible. The second, that his neighbour,
  Doctor Hisedale, with typically Teutonic persistence, rarely left him alone
  for more than a few minutes.</p>

  <p>"You have visited your Works since your arrival from foreign parts, Lord
  Dutley?" he enquired, during a momentary pause in the conversation.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," was the brief reply.</p>

  <p>"They are working overtime, I hear," the doctor continued, with a little
  sigh of envy. "That comes of manufacturing the one perfect production in the
  world. Soon I think that all of us smaller concerns will be absorbed in the
  great House of Boothroyd."</p>

  <p>Dutley turned and looked at his neighbour with the birth of a new
  suspicion stirring in his mind. This persistence was, in a sense,
  extraordinary, and there was an unpleasant, almost a sinister undernote in
  that last sentence which puzzled him.</p>

  <p>"I don't see why that should happen," he remarked. "After all, there are
  other clever chemists in the world. One of you people may stumble upon the
  formula which made our fortunes at any time."</p>

  <p>There was a curious curve of the full lips, a glint of light behind
  Hisedale's spectacles.</p>

  <p>"It is a possibility, of course," he admitted. "For my part, I am quite
  candid. I try. I spend my life trying."</p>

  <p>"Good luck to you!" Dutley said indifferently. "There's plenty of room in
  the world for all of us."</p>

  <p>"You show the British sporting spirit, Lord Dutley," his neighbour
  acknowledged. "Still, it is easy for you who have it to talk lightly to those
  who have not. Your last dividend was, I believe, forty per cent. None of us
  others can manage more than eight or nine, and now and then one of us goes
  under. All for a touch of the chemist's genius! You have never been afraid of
  spies in your factory, Lord Dutley, or of having your formula stolen?"</p>

  <p>Dutley sipped his champagne thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Well," he admitted, "if the formula were stolen, it would mean more
  competition, but after all we've been first in the field for a long time, and
  I suppose our own people must pretty well know it off by heart by now."</p>

  <p>"There was always a legend in the trade that your wonderful father would
  permit no copy, and that he had inaugurated a system of manufacture?"</p>

  <p>"My wonderful father," Dutley interrupted, at the end of his patience,
  "has been dead for some years."</p>

  <p>He turned back to Lucille, and they talked together in undertones. The
  meal drew towards its close, and Dutley's left shoulder preserved all the
  time its obstinate angle. Nevertheless, old-fashioned customs persisted in
  the house, and the men lingered at the table after the women had departed.
  Dutley promptly carried his glass up to his host's side.</p>

  <p>"Old man been worrying you?" the latter whispered.</p>

  <p>"He's damnably inquisitive."</p>

  <p>"Don't take any more notice of him," Mr. Bessiter advised. "He had a
  letter of introduction to me, so I had to do the civil. His firm are making a
  new issue of stock and they wanted our name on the prospectus. We've made up
  our mind, though, to have nothing to do with it. A glass of wine with you,
  Charles. I'm glad to see you back again. You'll forgive just one word, eh?"
  he added, with a glance down the table towards De Brest. "I think, if I were
  you, now that you're here, I'd fix it up with Lucille. She's a good girl, but
  it's a gay life nowadays."</p>

  <p>"I'm all for it," Dutley declared, as he nodded his greetings over the
  wine. "Can't think how you keep vintage port like this in a house you've only
  had for seven or eight years," he commented, as he set down his empty
  glass.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bassiter smiled and passed the decanter. He liked his port
  praised.</p>

  <p>"When I bought those pipes of 1890," he explained, "I had them bottled at
  my wine merchant's, and I've never had them moved. I have a few bottles sent
  down decanted when an occasion arrives. I look upon this as an occasion."</p>

  <p>"Very nice of you, sir," Dutley acknowledged. "It feels good to be home
  again, I can tell you."</p>

  <p>"Glad to hear you say so," his prospective father-in-law rejoined. "I
  should stick it out at home now for a bit, if I were you. There's plenty of
  sport to be had in this country for a man in your position. You ought to be
  good for a few more years' polo before you begin to put on weight. If you
  take my advice, Charles, you'll slip along now. That old bore Hisedale's got
  his eye on you, and I know Lucille wants to go on somewhere and dance."</p>

  <p>Dutley, with a word of thanks, rose hastily and made for the door. The
  doctor looked after him regretfully.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"I DO WISH," Dutley said peevishly, in the course of one of
  the dances at the Embassy an hour or so later, "that that fellow De Brest
  wouldn't keep on staring at you, Lucille. I call him jolly rude. He's only
  danced once with any one else of the party, does nothing but drink champagne
  and ogle you. Yet you tell me these foreigners have manners."</p>

  <p>She drew a little back from his arms to laugh at him.</p>

  <p>"You silly boy!" she scolded. "I'm very sorry for Sigismund de Brest.
  Can't you see that he's hopelessly in love with me, and that your return from
  the East, unmauled by any wild animal, is a terrible blow to him?"</p>

  <p>Dutley brought the dance to an abrupt conclusion. Afterwards he realised
  that his behaviour had been childish, but the undernote of suspense with
  which he had started the evening every now and then asserted itself.</p>

  <p>"Tired?" Lucille asked, a little mockingly.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am," he confessed. "Anyway, there's an awful crowd, isn't
  there, and I'd rather talk."</p>

  <p>They reached their table. The Baron de Brest was already on his feet,
  holding a chair on one side for them to pass. He bent down towards
  Lucille.</p>

  <p>"May I finish this?" he begged, in a half-whisper.</p>

  <p>She hesitated. The music was intriguing, the situation not without its
  appeal. There had been an undercurrent of resentment all the time in her mind
  against Dutley's prolonged absence, which was not yet fully dissipated, and
  De Brest, during the last few months, had been her very faithful and
  assiduous companion. It was scarcely playing the game to drop him too
  suddenly. She smiled assent, and turned back into the room again, eagerly
  followed by her new partner. Dutley watched them for a moment with a queer
  expression on his face. Then he resumed his seat.</p>

  <p>"Who is that Dutchman, anyway?" he asked Ronnie.</p>

  <p>"A new financial star," the young man replied. "For a fellow of his age,
  he's rather a marvel. He owns a bank in Amsterdam. He has offices in Berlin,
  Paris and here, and he's at the back of half a dozen companies who do your
  stunt. They say that he made a million before he was twenty-five."</p>

  <p>"Give me some champagne," Dutley begged. "I don't like him. I shouldn't be
  surprised if I didn't tell him so before long."</p>

  <p>"What's the fellow done? You couldn't mind his dancing with Lucille. It
  was you who gave up."</p>

  <p>Dutley pulled himself together.</p>

  <p>"You're right, Ronnie," he admitted. "I'm very nearly making an ass of
  myself. Still, that fellow annoyed me during dinner&mdash;couldn't keep his
  eyes off Lucille."</p>

  <p>"Lucille," Ronnie remarked, lighting a cigarette, "although I say it who
  am her brother, is damned good-looking."</p>

  <p>"So he's been hanging round, has he?"</p>

  <p>The young man nodded.</p>

  <p>"No use denying it, Charles. If it hadn't been for you, I expect he'd have
  had a shot with Lucille before now."</p>

  <p>"What about her?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, she's all right. Lucille flirts a bit, of course&mdash;all girls do
  nowadays&mdash;especially if they have a lover who goes off big game shooting
  half the year&mdash;but she's all right. She's never encouraged the fellow
  beyond making use of him for dances and that. A girl must have some one to
  take her round, you know. Here they come!"</p>

  <p>Lucille and her partner made an unexpectedly early return.</p>

  <p>"We can't move," Lucille explained. "The music's lovely, but it's like
  dancing on a tablecloth. A peer of the realm has trodden on my toe, and I
  have felt the moustache of a Guardsman against my cheek. I thought it was
  time to retire."</p>

  <p>"Let us go where there is more room," De Brest suggested. "What about the
  Kentucky?"</p>

  <p>Every one agreed. They moved towards the doorway.</p>

  <p>"I have my car here," De Brest ventured, leaning hopefully towards
  Lucille.</p>

  <p>"So have I, as it happens," Dutley observed quietly. "I'll take you,
  Lucille, if you don't mind. With De Brest's car, there'll be plenty of room
  for every one."</p>

  <p>Lucille laughed as she leaned back in a corner of the limousine.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you like the Baron de Brest, Charles."</p>

  <p>"I loathe the brute," was the frank reply. "If he'd behave like an
  ordinary human being, or an ordinary Anglo-Saxon, when he's asked out to a
  party, I wouldn't mind. As it is, he never takes his eyes off you, and hasn't
  the common decency to dance with either of the other two girls. He knows that
  we are engaged, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Of course he does."</p>

  <p>"Then if he goes on behaving like this, he's asking for trouble."</p>

  <p>He drew her towards him. She yielded unresistingly, but without
  fervour.</p>

  <p>"You've neglected me for a long time, Charles," she reminded him.</p>

  <p>"For too long?" he asked tersely.</p>

  <p>Her lips met his then with a little more feeling. A moment later, however,
  she pushed him back.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't say that," she replied, "but you must have some patience. You
  can't come home after nine months of amusement and sweep every one else off
  the board."</p>

  <p>"I see," he murmured. "What you mean is that you've been amusing yourself
  too."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Not with Sigismund de Brest particularly. You didn't expect me to go
  through the season without attention, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I didn't. It's only that Dutch fellow I object to. Anyhow,
  we're going to wipe him out."</p>

  <p>"Are we?" Lucille murmured.</p>

  <p>"You can't mean to tell me that you like the fellow?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>She deliberated for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure whether I like or dislike him. In a way he is attractive,
  and he's certainly good-looking. Then, he must be awfully clever."</p>

  <p>"Must he?"</p>

  <p>"To be a successful banker at his age needs brains, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Of a certain type," he conceded. "Oh, let's forget the fellow!"</p>

  <p>He drew her closer to him once more. Outside the Kentucky, she sat for a
  moment in the car, looking into her mirror, and touching up her lips.</p>

  <p>"You're terribly rough, Charles," she complained.</p>

  <p>"You're so wickedly intriguing," he apologised.</p>

  <p>They danced almost as they entered the room. The others found a table and
  occupied themselves with the usual tiresome deliberation as to what one could
  eat. When the music stopped, Dutley drew his companion on one side, and led
  her to the little bar. She climbed willingly on to a stool.</p>

  <p>"Lucille dear," he confided, "I'm afraid I haven't got the party spirit
  to-night. That fellow has got on my nerves. Let's sit here for a few
  minutes."</p>

  <p>"I should love to," she rejoined. "We'll drink champagne cocktails from a
  real bottle of champagne, and you can hold my hand. You will soon feel
  better."</p>

  <p>"The cure," he assured her, "has commenced already."</p>

  <p>They sat together for twenty minutes, and by degrees the little barriers
  of nervous irritation which had crept up between the two disappeared. They
  were seated arm in arm when presently, just as the strains of a peculiarly
  seductive waltz crept into the room, De Brest appeared.</p>

  <p>"We are all deserted," he complained, bowing. "May I have the pleasure,
  Miss Bessiter?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Bessiter is not dancing for the present," Dutley interposed
  quickly.</p>

  <p>She nodded confirmation, smiling at her would-be partner, however, very
  graciously. He bowed.</p>

  <p>"I will wait, then."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and you'll wait a long time," Dutley muttered, as he watched the
  tall, retreating form. "What does he think I've come back for&mdash;to look
  on whilst he dances with you?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be an idiot!" she laughed. "You can't really wonder at his not
  taking our engagement too seriously. I don't suppose he's ever seen me alone
  with you in his life."</p>

  <p>"I'll teach him to take it seriously," Dutley observed, making signs to
  the barman. "I don't think one more champagne cocktail would hurt us."</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear," she sighed, "I hope I'm not doing much to-morrow!"</p>

  <p>"I am," he groaned. "I am seeing old Sir Matthew at eight o'clock."</p>

  <p>"I can't see why they bother you," she reflected, tapping a cigarette end
  upon the counter. "It isn't as though you knew anything about the
  business."</p>

  <p>"I don't," he admitted, "but I'm still supposed to be the head of the
  concern. I wish I weren't. I think I shall resign after we're married. I
  couldn't stand the sight of another table heaped up with letters as mine is
  at the present moment."</p>

  <p>"Even an idle millionaire has his responsibilities," she warned him.</p>

  <p>"Well, I may not be a millionaire before long. Should you care much? I
  don't think I should."</p>

  <p>"I like money," she confessed frankly, "and I don't see how you're ever
  going to help being a millionaire. When one mentions the name of Boothroyd,
  every one shivers with excitement. You've got such a marvellous man there,
  too, at the head of things&mdash;old Sir Matthew Parkinson. I never saw such
  a wonderful representation of Croesus as his portrait in this year's
  Academy."</p>

  <p>"Sir Matthew is a shrewd fellow," Dutley agreed.... "Oh, damn!"</p>

  <p>De Brest, his hair smoother than ever, his smile more intense, his bow the
  studious effort of a courtier, presented himself for the second time. Dutley
  scowled at him, unmoved.</p>

  <p>"I make once more my request," he announced. "Miss Bessiter will not
  remain unkind all the evening."</p>

  <p>Afterwards Dutley marvelled at himself. He was a long-suffering man, and
  the occasions upon which he had lost his temper during his life had been few.
  He had had large numbers of natives under his control and a great many white
  men, who were trying enough at times to look after, he had kept cool in
  critical moments, and put up with all sorts of disappointments and hardships
  without grumbling. He had a reputation amongst his friends for
  imperturbability, and yet, on what was really very slight provocation, there
  is no doubt that during the next few seconds he completely lost command of
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Oh, do leave us alone," he begged angrily. "Why do you keep on butting
  in?"</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. Lucille was astonished. The young man went
  paler than ever.</p>

  <p>"Do you hear what I say?" Dutley demanded, sliding from his stool. "Go
  back to the others and leave us alone. Can't you understand that you're a
  nuisance?"</p>

  <p>"You are very rude," De Brest said, with rising truculence.</p>

  <p>"If I am, what are you going to do about it?" was the prompt retort.</p>

  <p>Dutley was standing now clear of the counter, facing the intruder, than
  whom he was several inches shorter. Perhaps it was not De Brest's intention
  really to strike a blow, but he certainly moved a little forward, his head
  lowered, his fists clenched, and a very ugly expression upon his face.
  Dutley, who was nothing if not quick, and who had just come back from an
  expedition where a scrap was nearly a daily occurrence, lunged forward, his
  fist landing squarely upon De Brest's jaw. The floor was slippery, and De
  Brest went over, clutching wildly at the air. He half saved himself, but
  finally lost his balance completely. Dutley stood over him and held out his
  hand to assist him to arise.</p>

  <p>"I'm damned sorry," he apologised.</p>

  <p>There was a tense silence. Half a dozen people collected in the doorway,
  and the barman rushed out from behind the counter. De Brest suffered himself
  to be helped to his feet by the latter. There was a livid mark on the side of
  his chin, and a few drops of blood.</p>

  <p>"I'm damned sorry," Dutley repeated, "but you really shouldn't have come
  worrying us."</p>

  <p>De Brest showed no signs of fight. He held the brass rail of the counter
  with one hand, and dabbed at his chin with his handkerchief. He looked
  intently at his adversary.</p>

  <p>"You will be very sorry for this, Dutley," he threatened. "You will be
  very sorry indeed."</p>

  <p>Dutley shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I'm at your service," he declared. "Whatever you wish to do about it, I
  am ready."</p>

  <p>De Brest's lips quivered a little. The under one seemed to slip sideways.
  If it was a smile, it contained the very incarnation of malice.</p>

  <p>"You will have nothing to do with what is coming to you for this," he
  rejoined. "It will just arrive. You will have no power to avert it. You will
  get from me what you deserve."</p>

  <p>Dutley looked at him curiously. He was not by any means a psychologist,
  but it always interested him to watch human beings in any critical phase of
  their lives. Here was a man who had been knocked down on perhaps insufficient
  provocation&mdash;a strong man, and more powerfully built than his opponent.
  That he was angry was obvious. He was coldly and whitely furious, yet there
  did not appear to be a single impulse in his body urging him to strike back.
  He was consumed with a sort of passion, but it was not a passion which
  demanded any physical retaliation. Dutley did not understand. He rather
  despised it.</p>

  <p>"If I have been in any way to blame, Miss Bessiter," De Brest said, "I
  apologise."</p>

  <p>"I think that Lord Dutley was very wrong indeed," Lucille told him
  gravely.</p>

  <p>The young man bowed.</p>

  <p>"I thank you," he murmured.</p>

  <p>He left the place, and turned towards the cloakroom.</p>

  <p>"Will you take me back, Charles, please," Lucille begged, slipping from
  her stool.</p>

  <p>"Don't be angry with me," he pleaded. "It isn't often I lose my
  temper."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that you should have done it before me?" she asked
  coldly.</p>

  <p>"Of course I shouldn't," he admitted. "The only thing is, the fellow
  looked as though he were coming for me. He has the longer reach, and I
  suddenly had the feeling that I must get in first."</p>

  <p>"You started by being rude to him," she reminded him.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't help it," he apologised. "The fellow had been annoying me ever
  since I entered your drawing-room. He was staring at you all dinner time. He
  tried to drive in the same car with you, tried to dance with you continually.
  Why? He must know we're engaged."</p>

  <p>Ronnie Bessiter came hurrying in.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he exclaimed. "Some one was saying there'd been a bit of a row.
  Where's Siggie?"</p>

  <p>"Siggie's gone home," Dutley answered. "I'm afraid I've behaved badly,
  Ronnie. Come and help me make things right with your sister."</p>

  <p>"Ronnie needn't worry," Lucille announced. "I sha'n't be silly about it. I
  think you were very wrong, Charles, but I'm not going to quarrel with
  you."</p>

  <p>"Dear girl!" Dutley murmured.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Ronnie wanted to know.</p>

  <p>"Why, your Baron friend has been ogling Lucille the whole of the evening,"
  Dutley explained&mdash;"trying to drive in the car with her, trying to shove
  himself in between us all the time. We came out here so that I could have
  Lucille to myself for a few minutes. He followed her, and asked her to dance,
  although you're even numbers without us. She refused, and in less than a
  quarter of an hour out he came again. I told him he wasn't wanted. After
  that, something else was said&mdash;I don't quite know what&mdash;he looked a
  little ugly himself, and I knocked him down. The barman helped him up, and
  he's gone away."</p>

  <p>"Didn't he show fight?" Ronnie asked.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it! He's got some other hideous form of torture preparing
  for me. He didn't specify what it was, but he departed in an atmosphere of
  mysterious threats. Never mind&mdash;Lucille's forgiven me. That bottle just
  holds three more cocktails, barman. Let's have them, and we'll go back to the
  others."</p>

  <p>"We'll do nothing of the sort," Lucille decided. "You shall dance with me
  once, to show that we're alive, and you shall take me home. I don't feel like
  any further festivities this evening."</p>

  <p>Young Bessiter clambered on to a stool, and sat for a moment in meditative
  silence.</p>

  <p>"I can't get over Siggie not showing fight," he remarked presently. "He
  doesn't look soft, and he's twice your size, Charles."</p>

  <p>Dutley shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"If I were a nervous person, I should remember what the natives say," he
  reflected. "'The most dangerous enemy is the man who takes a blow away with
  him.'"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DUTLEY dismounted from his horse and handed the reins to a
  groom, just as Sir Matthew's taxi pulled up in front of his door on the
  following morning. The two men entered the house together.</p>

  <p>"You keep early hours for London," Sir Matthew remarked.</p>

  <p>His companion nodded.</p>

  <p>"One of the only good qualities I inherited from the governor, I'm
  afraid," he acknowledged. "One gets into the way of it, too, in Africa. Can't
  do much trekking after the sun's up. This way, Sir Matthew. We'll have
  breakfast at once, and I'll change afterwards. I've been riding a steady old
  mare this morning and didn't get hot."</p>

  <p>He led his guest to a pleasant little breakfast room, with a wood fire
  burning in the grate, and a pile of newspapers on the table. A servant
  arranged a row of silver dishes on the sideboard, with tea and coffee on a
  hot-water stand.</p>

  <p>"That will do now," Dutley directed. "We'll wait upon ourselves. Sir
  Matthew, have a look and see what you fancy," he added, pouring himself out
  some tea. "Boothroyds went down three-eighths yesterday, I see."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew helped himself in silence and took his place at the breakfast
  table.</p>

  <p>"They'll fall more than that to-day, and again to-morrow," he continued.
  "Shall I tell you why?"</p>

  <p>"Because of what you told me last night, I suppose," Dutley said,
  completing his own selection from the sideboard and seating himself at the
  table.</p>

  <p>"Not only that. So far as I know, there isn't a whisper yet of what's
  happened to us. Yesterday's fall was simply due to continued selling."</p>

  <p>"Somebody getting rid of his shares, eh?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I'm here to talk to you about. I am speaking for Stephenson,
  Watherspoon and myself. We aren't rich men&mdash;not one of us&mdash;as
  money's reckoned to-day, and practically everything we have is in the
  company. I've worked hard all my life; so have the others. We're not going to
  be left without a bob in the world. That's why we've begun to sell some
  shares. We've drawn up an agreement amongst ourselves. We're putting half our
  holdings on the market."</p>

  <p>Dutley stirred his tea meditatively.</p>

  <p>"That seems reasonable enough," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"Glad you look at it that way. Now comes the question&mdash;what about
  you? Watherspoon, Stephenson and I own about forty thousand shares each. You
  must have something like five hundred thousand. Of course I've let you know
  the true state of affairs as soon as it was possible, but what I've come to
  see you about chiefly is this: we do not want you to go and lump all your
  shares on the market. We'd like you to promise to do what we're
  doing&mdash;that is, only dispose of half of them&mdash;and we'd like you to
  do that gradually, and to sell some of them abroad if possible. You go to
  your friend Bessiter, for instance," Sir Matthew continued, attacking his
  bacon and eggs with considerable spirit, "tell him you want to sell thirty
  for forty thousand and give him no explanation, and you'll start rumours of
  every kind."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't think of doing such a thing," Dutley assured his guest. "I
  haven't decided to sell any at all yet. After all, the value of a business
  doesn't depend wholly upon the price of its shares in the market, does it?
  There may sometimes be speculators at work who are wrong."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew nodded.</p>

  <p>"Quite right," he agreed, "but in this case there's a solid and a
  disastrous reason for a fall in the shares. We are doing badly. We are piling
  up losses instead of profits. We've got to face this&mdash;that unless our
  chemists perform a miracle, or we recover possession of the formula, we must
  either shut down or lose the whole of our capital."</p>

  <p>"Have you got the best men you know of up at the laboratories?" Dutley
  enquired.</p>

  <p>"We've got the men we've always had. We dared not make a change. We should
  have had to explain the position to any one we engaged."</p>

  <p>"I met a chap at dinner last night&mdash;a Doctor Hisedale," Dutley
  confided, "who tried to be very chatty with me."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew was silent for a moment. The hard lines had closed in around
  his mouth and eyes.</p>

  <p>"Professor Hisedale is a free lance just now," he said, "but he is also
  senior consulting chemist in the laboratory of one of our greatest
  continental competitors. He is probably over here spying."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't be a bit surprised," Dutley agreed. "He seemed disappointed
  to find that I was such an ignoramus."</p>

  <p>"There's really no man alive whose brains he could pick," Sir Matthew
  declared. "There was never a chemical process of manufacture so difficult or
  so complicated as the one by which we worked. The worst of it is it has a
  dozen ramifications. To give you one instance. By one of Blunn's discoveries,
  we were able two years ago to reduce the price of a certain type of silk yarn
  twenty-five per cent. We have huge contracts to fill at that reduction.
  Without the formula, we can only make the stuff at the old price, and that
  means, as you can see, a thundering big loss. Everything that scientists can
  do, our men are doing up there, but they simply can't get it. They fail, and
  fail, and fail."</p>

  <p>Dutley made a very brief visit to the sideboard. Somehow his appetite was
  scarcely a robust thing this morning.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Sir Matthew," he said, "you've been facing this problem for
  months now. Haven't you an idea in the world as to what's become of the
  formula?"</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew dropped his knife and fork with a clatter. His mouth seemed
  suddenly to take to itself a curious curve.</p>

  <p>"I?" he exclaimed. "Do you think I should be sitting here, talking like
  this, if I had an idea where it was? How the devil should I?"</p>

  <p>"Please don't misunderstand me," Dutley begged apologetically. "All that I
  meant, naturally, was that you must have thought this over to yourself many
  times and you might have arrived at some conclusion that you didn't even care
  to hint at."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew recommenced his breakfast with a sigh.</p>

  <p>"I never thought I should mention the word 'nerves'," he confided. "Didn't
  know what they were until a month ago. The formula is in the hands of the men
  who came to Boothroyds to steal it, but who they were and what they're going
  to do with it, is more than I can tell you. My first theory was that they
  were out for a big reward, and the Lord knows they could have it. Unless they
  sell it to one of our competitors there's no other way they can dispose of
  it."</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't we get a reward offered so that it would seem to come from
  a third person who would keep his mouth closed&mdash;no questions asked, and
  that sort of thing?" Dutley suggested.</p>

  <p>"That's a last resource, of course," Sir Matthew admitted, "but if it
  leaks out in any way we're done. The one thing we want now&mdash;till we've
  got rid of some shares at any rate&mdash;is secrecy. That reminds me, there's
  another reason for my visit&mdash;something else I want you to promise."</p>

  <p>"Go ahead."</p>

  <p>"If you sell any of your shares through Bessiters, don't tell them why.
  Don't let them have an idea that there's anything wrong at the Works. They're
  the most important firm dealing in industrials, and people always follow
  their lead."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," Dutley assented. "I won't breathe a word about our
  troubles to them. As a matter of fact," he concluded thoughtfully, "I haven't
  made up my mind to sell any of my shares yet."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew stared at his host across the table. The two presented a
  curious contrast&mdash;the stalwart Yorkshireman, a splendid figure of a man
  in his towering height and strength, his broad, benevolent face and features
  cut as though out of granite, and Dutley, in his fashionably cut but
  well-worn riding clothes, his sunburnt complexion, his clear blue eyes, and
  the half-gentle, half-humorous curve of his lips. It was not exactly a weak
  face, but a sensitive one. By the side of Sir Matthew, he appeared almost
  insignificant, yet a physiognomist might have remarked upon the fact that,
  small though the chin was, it had a firm setting, and though he had never
  quite got rid of his Oxford drawl his words were crisply and definitely
  spoken.</p>

  <p>"It's not my place to advise you," Sir Matthew said, "and I believe that
  you have other money besides your shares in the company, but it is my duty to
  tell you this&mdash;you not being a business man&mdash;that, unless things
  change, the shares which are standing at eighty to-day will be round about
  forty in six months' time, and probably down to ten or twelve by the end of
  next year."</p>

  <p>"I shall take a bit of a chance with my shares," Dutley decided. "I can't
  help thinking that those Johnnies up at the laboratories will learn by their
  mistakes. Even if they can't quite get the old stuff, they'll get somewhere
  near it in time."</p>

  <p>"There's a certain amount of common sense in that," Sir Matthew agreed,
  "but the trouble is that any week we may find the old stuff rolling on to the
  market from the Continent, made from our formula. There will go our trade
  then, in one swoop."</p>

  <p>"It's a queer situation," Dutley reflected, toying with some
  marmalade.</p>

  <p>"To any ordinary human being," Sir Matthew pronounced, "the situation is,
  of course, incomprehensible. The truth is that your father had one
  overmastering fear in his life, and when I was a young man I must say that to
  some extent I understood it. He knew that there were spies everywhere trying
  to get hold of his process. We used to be always beating them up and chucking
  them out of the place. The consequence was that we had to take all sorts of
  precautions. The different phases of the process were in different hands. One
  man had a mixture to deal with, but he didn't know of what it was composed,
  or in what proportion. He dealt with it according to instructions, passed it
  on to the next, and so on. There's no doubt," Sir Matthew concluded, "that if
  your father hadn't been so careful our competitors would have got hold of the
  same process, and we should never have made such a gigantic success of it as
  we have. On the other hand, we were first in the field. We should still have
  had a thundering good business, and we shouldn't have had this to face."</p>

  <p>Dutley was silent for a few moments, leaning back in his chair with his
  hands in the pockets of his riding breeches, his slatey blue eyes fixed upon
  vacancy. Sir Matthew sighed as he looked at him. He was inclined to consider
  this young man, on the whole, as something of a degenerate. Eton and Oxford
  had set their mark upon him, and the type was strange to the sturdy,
  little-travelled Yorkshireman. His thoughts wandered back a score of years.
  He imagined for a moment that it was the father who sat there, instead of the
  son.... Dutley roused himself, pushed a box of cigars across the table, and
  lit a cigarette himself.</p>

  <p>"Tell me the details of the burglary," he invited. "I've scarcely heard a
  word about it. There hasn't been a single arrest, has there?"</p>

  <p>"Worst thing that ever happened from a police point of view," Sir Matthew
  declared. "There were five of the burglars. They must have been lying within
  the Works all day, or mixed with the factory hands in some way. That wasn't
  difficult amongst a crowd of some sixteen or seventeen thousand. Soon after
  midnight, when the watchman in the office building had finished his first
  round, they got into the private office, and set to work upon the great
  safe."</p>

  <p>"Stop a minute," Dutley interrupted. "How did they get into the
  offices?"</p>

  <p>"They had a set of false keys," Sir Matthew explained. "With a staff of a
  hundred and twenty clerks and typists, that wouldn't have been difficult.
  There's no doubt that they would have got what they wanted and walked out
  without a soul being the wiser, but old Rentoul was working in his private
  laboratory above. He evidently heard them, and, instead of giving the alarm,
  like a sensible man, he came down and walked straight into them. That was the
  greatest disaster that could have happened to us. They shot him
  dead&mdash;the only man who had the whole thing, practically from beginning
  to end, in his head."</p>

  <p>"There was another man killed too, wasn't there?"</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew nodded.</p>

  <p>"One of the night watchmen met them as they were going out. Very likely he
  had heard the shot fired, for he was off his beat. Anyhow, he seems to have
  noticed a strange car in the shadows and made for the alarm bell. They shot
  him dead, within a yard of it. Then they just drove off, and
  disappeared."</p>

  <p>"The money they took was a bluff, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. It was a marvellously arranged coup, having one end and aim
  only&mdash;the formula."</p>

  <p>"Odd sort of a show," Dutley reflected. "Makes one wonder what kind of a
  person was at the back of it. A first-class burglary by experts, and two men
  murdered, just for that roll of papers."</p>

  <p>"Roll of papers, indeed!" Sir Matthew repeated scornfully. "Listen,
  Dutley. I'm not a man with much imagination, but can you conceive any other
  burglary in the world so easy to effect for such a prize? What would be the
  good of two million pounds' worth of Bank of England notes, for instance?
  They would have to be sold at a discount, and before the thieves could get
  rid of a quarter of them the rest would be utterly unnegotiable. I tell you
  that it's the most amazing, and might be the most profitable burglary that's
  ever been committed. The papers are worth two million of any one's money. The
  loss of them has cost us already half a million. It will cost us our
  existence, unless either our chemists do the trick, or we get them back
  again."</p>

  <p>Again Dutley relapsed into silence, looking thoughtfully out of the
  window, and again Sir Matthew wondered what he was thinking of, whether there
  was indeed a brain behind that narrow, freckled forehead, or whether these
  were vague musings in which he was indulging.</p>

  <p>"Let's talk about your own shares," Sir Matthew suggested at last. "I'll
  give you the names of a few brokers, if you like. Anything, so long as you
  keep away from Bessiters."</p>

  <p>Dutley stroked his chin meditatively.</p>

  <p>"I haven't made up my mind yet," he confided, "whether I shall sell any of
  my shares, or not. Mind you, you're quite right about yours. I have a pretty
  tidy fortune outside, you must remember. I rather think I shall hang on. It
  will keep the market up, and I don't fancy the idea of Boothroyds touching
  the mud."</p>

  <p>"Damned quixotic!" Sir Matthew declared. "There's no reason why you
  shouldn't realise say a half a million pounds' worth."</p>

  <p>"I don't feel like it at present," Dutley confessed. "You see, if the
  smash comes, every one will be having a go at me for not having stayed at
  home and looked after things a bit. If they find I haven't sold out, it will
  look better&mdash;governor's name, you know, and that sort of thing. I'll
  tell you what I am rather thinking of doing."</p>

  <p>"Another expedition?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but a home one this time. I'm rather inclined to have a shy at
  getting the formula back."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew laughed derisively.</p>

  <p>"It hasn't occurred to you, I suppose," he said, "that the whole of the
  Yorkshire police&mdash;and they're not exactly fools&mdash;and Scotland Yard,
  have been on the job for the last four months?"</p>

  <p>"I know that," Dutley assented. "That's what makes me think that there
  must have been something wrong about their methods&mdash;just something
  they've left out of their calculations."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew opened his mouth and closed it again. He felt rather sorry for
  this young man, and there seemed to be no reason why he should hurt his
  feelings.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you find the man with the formula," he begged, "be sure that you
  get us the first offer for it. Where we shall raise the money from, I don't
  know, but we'll buy it."</p>

  <p>Dutley balanced a spoon on the edge of his cup.</p>

  <p>"I don't know!" he reflected. "There seems to me to be something a little
  illogical in buying back a thing which belongs to you. I would rather acquire
  it in some other fashion."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew smiled tolerantly.</p>

  <p>"Those buccaneering expeditions of yours," he remarked, "have filled your
  head with the wrong sort of stuff."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps so," Dutley agreed. "Nevertheless.... Shall you be at the Works
  all next week?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly shall."</p>

  <p>"See you one morning, about eleven, then."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that you're really coming down to Leeds?" Sir Matthew asked
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>His host smiled. The abstracted look had gone from his face. He had the
  air of a man who had been revolving a purpose in his mind, and had arrived at
  a decision.</p>

  <p>"I am coming," he announced, "to have a look at the scene of the
  burglary."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE three men&mdash;Assistant Commissioner Harrison,
  Inspector Bridgeman, and Dutley&mdash;sat round the table in the former's
  room at Scotland Yard, a little later on the same morning. The official
  attitude was apologetic.</p>

  <p>"Not one of our most brilliant efforts, the Boothroyd burglary," Bridgeman
  regretted. "I was up in Yorkshire a few days ago, and saw Sir Matthew
  Parkinson. I'm afraid he's very disappointed with us, and I don't blame
  him."</p>

  <p>"How do you account for the fellows having made such a clean get-away?"
  Dutley asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, for one thing," the Inspector explained, "the local police didn't
  send for us for four days, and by that time the ground had been pretty well
  scratched over. We ought to have been on the spot the next morning."</p>

  <p>"Of course the money didn't amount to anything," Dutley went on, "but the
  loss of the papers has put us in a bit of a hole up at the Works."</p>

  <p>"Sir Matthew was explaining that to me," Bridgeman acknowledged. "I am
  rather surprised, under the circumstances, that you haven't heard
  something&mdash;indirectly, of course&mdash;from the thieves."</p>

  <p>The Assistant Commissioner, who had been leaning back in his chair,
  intervened.</p>

  <p>"You'd have heard from them all right," he declared, "if they'd been able
  to carry out the affair, as they had evidently hoped, without violence. As
  things are at present, though, any traffic with the papers is the direct line
  to the criminal. I am sorry to say so, Lord Dutley, but I doubt whether
  you'll ever see them again."</p>

  <p>"Not even if you catch the burglars?"</p>

  <p>The Assistant Commissioner shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid the first thing they'd do would be to destroy anything that
  came out of the safe."</p>

  <p>"Well, our competitors won't get them at any rate, then," Dutley observed.
  "That's one consolation."</p>

  <p>"Talking of your competitors, Lord Dutley," the Inspector said, "reminds
  me of what I was pointing out to Sir Matthew last week. You know enough, I
  daresay, about the routine of criminal catching to realise that, directly
  after a marvellously planned <i>coup</i> like this has been carried out, the
  chief part of our energies is devoted not to the clues on the spot, which are
  generally misleading, but to ascertaining the whereabouts of any of the
  likely men who might have been concerned in it."</p>

  <p>"I've heard something of the sort," Dutley acknowledged. "Jolly
  interesting way of tackling the business, I should think."</p>

  <p>"It's cold common sense when you come to look at it," the Inspector went
  on. "Well, we've a pretty exhaustive list of all the star burglars in London
  and the provinces&mdash;especially those who work in gangs&mdash;and your job
  wasn't done by a single one of them. Not only that, but we haven't a man on
  our books capable of opening that safe in the way it was opened whose
  whereabouts we can't trace on that particular night."</p>

  <p>"What conclusion does that lead you to?" Dutley enquired.</p>

  <p>"The only possible one is that there were amateurs concerned in it, with
  probably a foreign professional," Bridgeman explained. "I'm almost certain,
  for instance, that the safe opening was done by an American. It was done by
  some one who followed American methods, anyhow."</p>

  <p>"Amateurs?" Dutley reflected. "That's interesting, at any rate."</p>

  <p>"It's interesting in this way," the Assistant Commissioner observed,
  leaning forward. "I've talked this over with the Chief more than once. The
  value of those papers, I gather, is immense, but to whom? Not to the general
  public. Either to your own firm or a competitor?"</p>

  <p>"I see the idea," Dutley acknowledged.</p>

  <p>The Assistant Commissioner opened a drawer, and passed a sheet of
  typewritten paper across the table.</p>

  <p>"There is a list, Lord Dutley," he pointed out, "of firms engaged in the
  same manufacture as yourself. I had it compiled only yesterday. Talk it over
  with Sir Matthew. I won't say more than that. You can keep the list. I have
  several copies."</p>

  <p>Dutley folded it up, and placed it in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"What about a reward?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"A reward would have been the obvious way of dealing with the matter," the
  Assistant Commissioner agreed, "but for the criminal side of it. That's what
  ties our hands so completely. The papers may be of vital importance to you,
  but the man who carried the gun that night is the man we want to get at. An
  undiscovered murderer is one of the blackest marks which can possibly exist
  against our organization. It doesn't often happen, I am glad to say. Our
  average in that respect is, as a matter of fact, the best in the world."</p>

  <p>"I see," Dutley meditated. "Your one idea is the murderer, and directly
  you get on his track, as you were saying just now, the papers will probably
  be destroyed."</p>

  <p>"If it hadn't been for the shooting," the Inspector confided, "there are
  several ways we might have tried to get the papers for you, Lord Dutley. As
  it is, however, we are pretty well helpless."</p>

  <p>"Even an indirect participant in the affair, you see," the Assistant
  Commissioner explained, "becomes automatically an accomplice in the crime.
  There have been occasions when it has been politic for us to look the other
  way when a large reward has been offered, and it has been very important to
  have certain property restored. In your case, however, the two murders make
  that absolutely impossible. All we can promise you, Lord Dutley, is that we
  shall do our best, but at the same time I tell you frankly I'm afraid your
  papers are gone for good and all. Cold comfort, I fear, but there it is," he
  concluded, holding out his hand.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3><br>

  <p class="first">INSPECTOR BRIDGEMAN descended the stairs with the departing
  visitor. He was an imposing-looking man, over six feet high, with black hair
  streaked with grey, sleepy eyes and a somewhat deliberate manner, but a man
  who, nevertheless, gave one the impression of possessing an immense reserve
  of power and intelligence.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't think, Lord Dutley," he said, "that the case is stagnant.
  We've several people at the present moment under surveillance&mdash;nothing
  very hopeful, unfortunately, but one never knows. You won't mind just a word
  of advice, I'm sure," he went on, after a moment's hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Do I seem that sort of an ass?" Dutley rejoined cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"You've been a bit of an explorer, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"I've done just a spot of travelling in a small way," Dutley acknowledged.
  "I was in Abyssinia, as a matter of fact, when this affair happened."</p>

  <p>"Just so. Well, what I was going to say is, that this is one of those very
  rare cases when I think that a little intelligent amateur effort might
  produce good results. Have a finger in the pie yourself. Leave Abyssinia
  alone for a time, and try an adventure a trifle nearer home."</p>

  <p>The two men were standing side by side in the massive doorway&mdash;the
  Inspector, large, ponderous and deliberate, yet somehow or other diffusing an
  impression of kindliness; Dutley, debonair, of pleasant appearance, very much
  more in earnest than usual.</p>

  <p>"Odd you should say that, Inspector," he commented. "It's pretty well what
  I've made up my mind to do."</p>

  <p>Bridgeman nodded approvingly.</p>

  <p>"You see, as things are at present," he pointed out, "from your point of
  view it's stalemate here. We're not looking for your formula. We're looking
  for the criminals. They're lying low, and we're lying low, and if they get a
  fit of nerves, your formula may go to the back of the fire. However valuable
  it may be, there's no one will want to be hung for it. That's why I say, take
  a hand in this show yourself, Lord Dutley. You won't do us any harm; as
  things are at present, I don't think we're going to do you any good."</p>

  <p>"I call this very friendly of you, Inspector," Dutley acknowledged,
  shaking hands.</p>

  <p>"By-the-by, there's a little man we come in touch with now and then," the
  Inspector remarked&mdash;"Edward Wolf his name is&mdash;Teddy Wolf in the
  profession&mdash;who I think might be useful to you. It will seem to you
  odd," he continued, with a large, slow smile, "for a Scotland Yard man to
  recommend an amateur detective, but I'm not a prejudiced man, and they have
  their uses sometimes. They can deal with certain phases of a case like yours,
  for instance, in a way which I couldn't. If I were you, Lord Dutley, I should
  send for Teddy Wolf to come and see you. He lives at 47a, Longacre. If you
  want any work done in shadowing, enquiries, and that sort of thing, he's
  honest, and as clever as they make 'em."</p>

  <p>"I certainly will," Dutley assented. "There are lots of enquiries I might
  want to make which I couldn't undertake personally. Jolly useful chap for me,
  I should think."</p>

  <p>"You won't mind not mentioning my name," the Inspector begged. "It isn't
  exactly a professional thing I'm doing, but I've seen a good many queer cases
  solved in an unusual manner, and this might very well be one of them. I shall
  keep an eye on you," he added, "and remember, if you get the formula, we want
  the criminal."</p>

  <p>Dutley smiled, as he stepped into the limousine.</p>

  <p>"You shall have him," he promised, "as soon as the formula is back in our
  safe at Marlingthorpe."</p>

  <p>Many times after his departure, the Inspector found himself wondering
  whether the smile of his departing visitor was that of a sanguine child, or
  of a shrewd man.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"THE person you were expecting, my lord," Burdett announced,
  at a little before seven o'clock that evening.</p>

  <p>Dutley threw down his paper, which had just been delivered, and glanced
  towards the door. Mr. Edward Wolf was already looking about him with
  curiosity. He relinquished his hat reluctantly, placing it on the floor by
  his side, and sat on the edge of the chair to which Dutley courteously
  motioned him with a comically mingled air of diffidence and bravado. He was a
  small man, neatly dressed in unobtrusive clothes, sandy of complexion, with
  freckles on his face and forehead. He had the narrow eyes of a ferret, eyes
  which were never at rest. Dutley had a feeling that already he could have
  stood a cross-examination upon the contents of the room.</p>

  <p>"Very good of you to come round so soon, Mr. Wolf," he said. "I wondered
  whether you could help me in a few enquiries I am making."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, no, my lord," was the startlingly direct reply. "I don't want
  to have nothing to do with your burglary case."</p>

  <p>Dutley stared at his visitor in genuine surprise. It was several seconds
  before he could even frame the natural rejoinder.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you why not, my lord, all right, if you want to know. I don't
  enquire who told you to send for me, but they might have spared themselves
  the trouble. I'm a first-rate go-between when there's been an ordinary
  robbery&mdash;say a lady's lost her engagement ring, and is willing to give
  anything to get it back again, and if the police step in they've got to cop
  the man. That's the sort of case I'm good at. There isn't a thief or a
  burglar in London, I don't know. I know what they've got to part with, and I
  know where they're likely to go with it, but your job ain't in my line."</p>

  <p>"But tell me why not?" Dutley persisted.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you why not," the little man replied, moistening his lips.
  "There's many as will tell you&mdash;even the police themselves&mdash;that
  I'm as clever at scenting out a crime as the best detective they ever had in
  the Force. I live for crime, in a manner of speaking. I make a study of every
  robbery, every disappearance, every murder that takes place. I get home
  before the police often, and they know it. They'd employ me at Scotland Yard
  if they dared, and if I were willing. You're a bit of a sportsman, aren't
  you, my lord? You use dogs after game. I'm like that. If the game is the
  criminal, I'm the dog&mdash;with a nose, too, I can tell you."</p>

  <p>"What I should like to understand is," Dutley explained, "why you don't
  want to listen to what I have to say. I'm mixed up in a crime, or rather my
  firm is. Our place near Leeds was burgled&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Save your time, my lord," Edward Wolf interrupted. "I tell you there
  ain't a crime committed from John o' Groat's to Land's End that I couldn't
  lecture to you about. You're Boothroyds, the art silk manufacturers. You've
  got a factory at Marlingthorpe, near Leeds. Four months ago to-night,
  burglars ransacked your private offices, opened the safe, stole between five
  and six thousand pounds, and a number of documents. An old chap came in and
  interrupted them&mdash;whizz, and out he went! They shot him dead. A watchman
  was closing the gates against them. He reached out for the alarm bell, and
  kingdom come for him! You can't tell me anything about your burglary. I can
  tell you this, though. I'm not having any truck with it."</p>

  <p>Dutley lit a cigarette, and pushed the box across the table to his
  visitor. The latter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Don't smoke and don't drink," he announced. "I don't eat much, if it
  comes to that."</p>

  <p>"You're a queer sort of fellow," Dutley remarked, with a smile. "Now, pull
  yourself together and tell me why you don't want to take my job on."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you the truth," was the prompt reply, "and you may as well know
  it now as later. The people who planned your burglary are too hot for me. I
  don't interfere in that sort of lay-out."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's strange. The police have an idea that they weren't
  professional burglars at all&mdash;not all of them, at any rate."</p>

  <p>"And the police are bally well right. I tell you this, though. They're a
  damned sight more dangerous. The regular burglar has his living to make, he
  knows about what he's going to get if he's lagged, and he's generally a man
  of regular habits. There's no killing about our chaps, and very little
  gunning, except for show. What they want to do if they're copped is to live
  to rob another day. I'm not afraid at all of ferreting about amongst that
  lot. Is it the documents you're after, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Well, as a matter of fact, it is," Dutley acknowledged.</p>

  <p>"I guessed that. I'd have had them for you by this time to-morrow, terms
  being acceptable, if it had been anywhere amongst the blokes I know of. I'm
  not having any truck with this gang. I don't know who they are, and I don't
  want to."</p>

  <p>"Would a thousand pounds tempt you to change your mind?" Dutley enquired.
  "Five thousand if through your efforts the papers were recovered?"</p>

  <p>"You shall have the truth, Guv'nor. You may as well have it first as last.
  I've told you what I think of myself, and it's true. I'd make any detective
  sing small I got up against&mdash;but, Gawd," Edward Wolf added, leaning a
  little forward, "I'm afraid!"</p>

  <p>"You mean that you're a coward?"</p>

  <p>"You've got it in one, Guv'nor&mdash;no beating about the bush. I don't
  have any truck with a gang who shoot like that. I can tell you, perhaps, more
  about it than you know. I can tell you this. The old chemist who blundered
  in&mdash;he was shot exactly through the middle of the heart, and not from
  too near either. One bullet he got, and out went his light. Well now, listen.
  The watchman at the gate. He got his, within an inch of the same
  place&mdash;through the middle of the heart, mind you. Dead as a door nail,
  as quick as you could snap your fingers. Men who go about doing that sort of
  thing can do as they like so far as I'm concerned. I keeps away."</p>

  <p>Dutley rose to his feet, and stood upon the hearthrug.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Edward Wolf," he said, "you seem to me to be an honest man."</p>

  <p>"No compliment nowadays," was the brief rejoinder.</p>

  <p>"Do you make a good income at your profession, may I ask?"</p>

  <p>"Not so much as I might do if I'd the courage of a louse," Mr. Edward Wolf
  admitted frankly. "I don't know how it is, but since I was a kid I've been
  the same. If I saw a firearm, I'd crawl under the table. The sight of a knife
  would give me the shivers. If I see two men fighting with their fists only, I
  leg it as hard as I can. I've got the brains, and that's all I've got. The
  sneak thief or the gentleman robber I can deal with, but I wouldn't stir my
  little finger against any one who can hold a gun like that bloke up at your
  place."</p>

  <p>"I understand," Dutley sympathised. "Some men are made like that. Now,
  what I am wondering is whether I could not make use of your brains without
  running you into any danger?"</p>

  <p>The little man's ferret eyes shot round the room. They ended peering at
  Dutley, narrow slits of cunning.</p>

  <p>"Tell me straight," he begged, and there was a curious hoarseness in his
  voice, the symbol of an underlying terror, "what is it you want?"</p>

  <p>"The papers&mdash;nothing but the papers," Dutley answered quickly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Edward Wolf brooded for several moments.</p>

  <p>"You've got some sense, I suppose," he said presently. "It's clear enough
  to you that there was only two men who counted in that job&mdash;one was the
  safe breaker, and the other&mdash;he's the man I wouldn't lift a finger
  against&mdash;he's the man who run the show. The safe breaker's out of my
  line. He wasn't one of our chaps. I know 'em all, and if I'd been the toffs
  at Scotland Yard I'd have combed all the steamers that sailed for New York
  for a fortnight after the job. They'd have got him all right. The other man,
  I've told you before&mdash;I ain't doing anything about him&mdash;but you can
  take this from me, it's the chap who fired those two shots who's got the
  papers. The others are duds."</p>

  <p>"You're probably right," Dutley agreed. "At any rate, you open up a very
  interesting line of investigation. If one could arrive at one of the duds, he
  might squeal."</p>

  <p>"Might and mightn't," Edward Wolf grunted. "The man who can shoot like the
  man who handled his gun up at your Works isn't likely to have squealers in
  the gang. They know what's coming to them."</p>

  <p>"You can at least answer me this question," Dutley went on. "Mind you, I'm
  going to pay you for your visit. If you work for me, I shall probably pay you
  better than you've ever been paid before in your life, but now that we're
  alone, you can at least tell me this. Have you any idea as to the identity of
  the man who was at the head of the gang?"</p>

  <p>"Thank God I haven't," was the fervent reply. "Mind you, I shouldn't go
  after him if I had, but I tell you straight, I'm as big a mug as all those
  red hats at Scotland Yard over that. The man who fired those two
  shots&mdash;I lay you a hundred to one, Guv'nor, it was the same
  man&mdash;was the man who planned that get-away, which was the cleverest ever
  staged, and he was a newcomer to the game, in this country at any rate. I can
  tell you that without coming to any harm, anyway, and whoever wants to go out
  after him can do it. I sha'n't&mdash;not for a thousand quid."</p>

  <p>Dutley moved to the sideboard and helped himself to a whisky and soda.</p>

  <p>"I have to thank you, Mr. Wolf," he acknowledged, "for a very entertaining
  conversation. I recognise, of course, that your call has been professional.
  What about a couple of tenners, eh?"</p>

  <p>The little man almost snatched at the notes which Dutley laid on the table
  before him.</p>

  <p>"I wish I could work for you," he regretted. "Perhaps I might do something
  about one of those duds."</p>

  <p>"Bring me any information you can," Dutley enjoined, "and you shall be
  thoroughly well paid for it. Bring me the name of the man you're so terrified
  of, and I'll give you a thousand pounds. You needn't go near him. I'll see to
  that. Bring me the papers he stole, and you shall have twenty thousand."</p>

  <p>Edward Wolf looked round the room like a trapped fox. The twin demons of
  avarice and cowardice were preying upon his vitals.</p>

  <p>"I'm making no promise," he faltered. "I'll see. If I find out anything,
  you'll have to give me time to get away."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," Dutley promised. "You don't need to run any risk. I'm
  going down to Leeds to-morrow. When I come back, I shall send for you. A
  little chat won't do us any harm. Twenty pounds a time, mind. If you haven't
  any news for me, I may have some for you."</p>

  <p>There was a discreet knock at the door. Burdett made his apologetic
  entrance.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, my lord," he announced. "The Baron de Brest is on the
  telephone. He wished to know whether you would speak to him for a
  moment."</p>

  <p>"Tell him that I am not at home," Dutley replied.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry, my lord," Burdett regretted, "I'm afraid I said that you
  were in. He said something about a cocktail party at his rooms."</p>

  <p>"Whatever you said before, unsay it," Dutley ordered. "I am not at home. I
  am never at home to the Baron de Brest if he rings up."</p>

  <p>"Very good, my lord."</p>

  <p>"And, Burdett&mdash;while you're about it, you can show this gentleman
  out."</p>

  <p>Mr. Edward Wolf picked up his hat, which had rolled unaccountably back on
  to the floor. His eyes were more ferret-like than ever. He neither looked at
  Dutley nor the waiting manservant. He examined instead the crown of his
  hat.</p>

  <p>"Lord Dutley," he said, in a low tone, "forgive me. I don't want to be
  inquisitive, but what was the name of the gentleman?"</p>

  <p>Dutley stared at him in surprise.</p>

  <p>"What gentleman?"</p>

  <p>"The one who's telephoning."</p>

  <p>"Calls himself the Baron de Brest," Dutley rejoined. "Why, what do you
  want to know for?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all, my lord. Thank you very much for your generosity. I'll
  come round again whenever you send for me."</p>

  <p>He walked unsteadily towards the open door and disappeared. Dutley stared
  after him in surprise. The telephone rang in the hall again, and the door was
  re-opened abruptly. Mr. Edward Wolf looked in. He jerked his thumb
  backwards.</p>

  <p>"He's answering the telephone," he confided, and once again his voice was
  hoarse as though with some sort of emotion. "I'm a coward for myself all
  right, sometimes I'm a bit of a coward for others. You let that Baron alone,
  my lord. That's all."</p>

  <p>He slammed the door. Dutley listened with amazement to his pattering
  footsteps in the hall outside.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DUTLEY, arriving at the great Boothroyd Works at an
  unexpectedly early hour in the morning, and before the private offices were
  even open, begged for a guide, and for the first time in his life made a
  complete tour of the place. His impressions remained vividly with him for
  many months afterwards&mdash;the roar of what seemed to him miles of
  machinery in the huge one-storey sheds, the ceaseless turmoil, men and women
  hurrying about like ants, long galleries crowded with workpeople bending over
  strange, mechanically assisted tasks. He rode in the little electric tramway,
  plunged his hands into baskets full of spongy, freshly twisted yarn, glanced
  into the noisome-looking, strongly protected pools of chemically treated
  liquid, breathed its pungent odours, everywhere imbibed something of that
  sense of productive energy, the storm and triumph of creation. To all
  appearance it seemed very much the same as on his previous, more superficial
  visits, yet Dutley fancied that he was conscious of a subtle change. He
  fancied that there was a certain restlessness, especially about the heads of
  the departments, a lack of pride in the products they showed him. He came
  across a young foreman gazing thoughtfully down into a pool of dark liquid,
  into which he had just lowered a thermometer. There was an expression upon
  the youth's face which puzzled him.</p>

  <p>"What are you trying to do?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"The impossible, I'm afraid," was the grave reply. "We have to go on
  trying, though."</p>

  <p>"Why the impossible?"</p>

  <p>The foreman shook his head nervously.</p>

  <p>"You will excuse me, sir, but in this department we are not allowed to
  answer questions."</p>

  <p>He consulted his thermometer, and moved off. Dutley's guide explained.</p>

  <p>"I happen to know what's the trouble there, my lord," he confided. "They
  were talking in the laboratory about it last night. The young man would have
  answered you, of course, if he had known who you were. There's twenty tons of
  valuable chemical liquid there, and it won't come right. It never will come
  right. It will either make bad material, or be wasted.... I think we shall
  find Sir Matthew if we get back now. I saw his car come in some quarter of an
  hour ago."</p>

  <p>They made their way to the main suite of offices, and passed through the
  crowded counting-houses until at last they were ushered into Sir Matthew's
  private room. He rose to greet Dutley with an air of surprise. The latter's
  first impression was that, for some reason or other, his visit was not
  altogether welcome.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were going to let us know when you came down," he observed.
  "Grace was expecting you to stay with us."</p>

  <p>"I came, as I do most things, on impulse," Dutley explained. "Felt the
  sort of urge, you know, and hopped into the mail last night. I shall go over
  and pay my respects to Grace, if I may, this afternoon."</p>

  <p>He accepted an easy-chair, and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Nothing fresh?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew pushed away the sheets of figures which he had been
  studying.</p>

  <p>"No good news, at any rate."</p>

  <p>"I have been wondering&mdash;funny how things come into one's head,"
  Dutley remarked, looking a little vacantly out of the window&mdash;"what on
  earth made poor old Rentoul stay so late that night."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew stared hard at his questioner, who was apparently watching the
  rows of drays in the yard.</p>

  <p>"Just damned bad luck, I suppose," he growled&mdash;"his and ours.
  Interested in some experiments, perhaps. He was often here till all hours of
  the night."</p>

  <p>Dutley shook his head with the pleased air of a child able to correct an
  elder.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, he wasn't," he declared. "I've been making a few enquiries. Man
  of very regular habits. Left the Works, as a rule, between six and seven
  every night."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. It was obvious that Sir Matthew was not quite
  himself. His face had darkened. He was shaking with something which seemed
  like anger.</p>

  <p>"Where the mischief did you get that from?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I forget who it was," Dutley replied indifferently&mdash;"some one I was
  talking to. Queer thing," he went on, tapping a fresh cigarette thoughtfully
  upon the table, "when I first got here this morning, I couldn't get a soul to
  answer a single question I asked. Quite all right so long as they thought I
  was a stranger, of course. I had to remind them who I was&mdash;Chairman of
  the Directors, you know, and that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew breathed hard. Once again, he scrutinised the young man's
  face. Then he laughed to himself, softly and not altogether pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Well, I think you're wrong about Rentoul," he said. "You probably got
  hold of some one who didn't know anything about it. By-the-by, did you pay
  that visit to Scotland Yard?"</p>

  <p>"I was there yesterday," Dutley confided. "I saw the Assistant
  Commissioner, and the Inspector who had the case in hand. I must say they
  didn't seem proud of themselves."</p>

  <p>"I should damn well think they aren't," Sir Matthew grunted.</p>

  <p>"All a jolly mix-up it seems to me," Dutley went on despondently. "They
  don't care a fig about our formula. They only want the man with the gun. The
  Commissioner was babbling all the time something about the percentage of
  undiscovered murderers. Pretty cold-blooded way of looking at it, I think,
  when we're on the highroad to bankruptcy."</p>

  <p>"They didn't tell you anything you didn't know before, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Not a thing. The Inspector seemed the more human Johnnie of the two, and
  he seemed to think we ought to go out after the formula ourselves, if we
  wanted it."</p>

  <p>"I should think it would have been one, two, three for the Inspector if
  his Chiefs knew that he had been indulging in that sort of talk," Sir Matthew
  commented.</p>

  <p>"What we pay them for, I should like to know," Dutley grumbled. "Oh, there
  was another thing he said. He thought that some of the gang, at any rate,
  were amateurs."</p>

  <p>"All the more scandalous their not being able to track them down,
  then."</p>

  <p>Dutley leaned a little further back in his chair.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't be too severe," he observed. "Amateurs are pretty good at some
  games. Remember, they beat the professionals at cricket last season. There's
  another advantage, too, this gang would have, if they really were not
  professional criminals&mdash;they might have had much better opportunities
  for studying the lay-out of the place."</p>

  <p>"I'm sick of all these theories," Sir Matthew declared impatiently. "I
  never heard so much ineffectual talk in my life as I heard from that
  Inspector and from the Commissioner the twice I've been to Scotland
  Yard."</p>

  <p>"Theories help sometimes," Dutley reflected, leaning still further back in
  his chair, and gazing up at the ceiling. "If there's anything in this amateur
  theory, for instance, it seems likely that one of them, at any rate, may have
  been employed about the place. What about getting out a list of every one
  who's left our employ say within three months of the burglary&mdash;not
  workpeople, of course, but fellows from the office who may have been in the
  know?"</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew made no movement. He was holding his chin in his hand, and his
  hard, calculating eyes were fixed upon his visitor.</p>

  <p>"Waste of time," he pronounced.</p>

  <p>Dutley abandoned the subject for the moment.</p>

  <p>"Was this room the scene of the burglary?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"It was. Poor Rentoul evidently came through that door to the left, and
  was found dead within a couple of yards of the threshold. There is the safe
  in the wall. It took first prize at the Chicago Industrial Exhibition last
  year. We had to get a man over from America to reset the locks."</p>

  <p>Dutley strolled about the place, apparently without any fixed purpose. He
  stood first in one position and then in another. Finally he lounged over
  towards the window.</p>

  <p>"Did the car in which these fellows escaped get out through the main
  gates?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"They were never unlocked. The burglars parked their car just outside the
  tunnel through which the trams run down to the river. The gates there are
  very light and easily opened. You can stroll down and have a look at them if
  you like."</p>

  <p>Dutley shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not worth the trouble, thanks. I'm afraid I haven't got much of the
  detective instinct anyhow, but I was just trying to get the scheme of the
  affair into my head. I must say," he wound up, "that so far as my feeble
  intelligence can cope with the matter, I incline very much to Scotland Yard's
  present idea, that at any rate some of the marauders knew the place. What do
  you think?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think," was the somewhat brusque reply. "What's the good? It
  doesn't lead us anywhere."</p>

  <p>"Still, I'm inclined to believe that that list would be interesting,"
  Dutley meditated.</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Wait here," he enjoined shortly. "I'll get it for you."</p>

  <p>He left the room, and Dutley listened to the slamming of the door with a
  mild wonder in his blue eyes. Left alone, he rose once more to his feet and
  walked to the window. From there, he looked out across the yard towards the
  five huge buildings, and the seemingly endless rows of one-storey sheds
  stretching for an incredible distance, factory chimneys belching smoke,
  walled-in spaces with postern doors, before each one of which was a
  watchman's hut to guard the great pits inside, lakes of chemicals. The
  electric tramway was conveying a long line of trucks from the factory to the
  warehouses, and a constant stream of men, with sheaves of paper in their
  hands, were continually passing backwards and forwards between the
  counting-houses and the factory proper. There were many thousands of
  workpeople scattered about in that long array of buildings, all working for
  the world-famed firm of Boothroyds. Dutley raised the window, and from where
  he stood, the roar of machinery seemed every now and then to surge into the
  room with an overmastering force, like some new element of nature passed out
  of control. The last time he had stood where he was standing now, and
  listened to it, although it was something entirely outside his life, he had
  felt a momentary thrill of inspiration. To-day there was something
  threatening, almost sinister, in that concentrated roar. It was like a
  reminder that the great harnessed forces at work, which could draw
  merchandise from the jaws of a hundred machines, which had swelled the
  banking account of the firm and lit with greed the eyes of the investors as
  they watched the shares rise and rise, might in their turn rend and
  destroy....</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew re-entered the room, resumed his seat, and passed a
  typewritten piece of paper across to Dutley, who glanced it through without
  any apparent show of interest. When he had finished his perusal, however, he
  looked across at Sir Matthew.</p>

  <p>"Is this supposed to be a complete list?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"A complete list of every one who counts. We haven't put the operatives
  in, of course."</p>

  <p>"Bet you there's a name left out."</p>

  <p>"I should think it most unlikely," Sir Matthew rejoined, a little
  startled. "Besides, which of our employees did you ever know by name?"</p>

  <p>"Chap called Thomas Ryde," Dutley announced without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew sat quite still in his place, but there was a curious change
  in his expression, an utterly unfamiliar glitter in his eyes. He seemed about
  to speak, then changed his mind. That curiously shaped mouth of his was drawn
  sideways as though by some inexplicable emotion.</p>

  <p>"What do you know about Thomas Ryde?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Dutley grinned.</p>

  <p>"Not much," he confessed. "The last time I was up here, though, just
  before I went abroad, a little fellow with gold-rimmed glasses was in this
  office, lecturing you about how certain books ought to be kept. I heard you
  speak of him to Stephenson as Thomas Ryde."</p>

  <p>"But how on earth did you happen to remember the name?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll tell you how I remembered it," Dutley explained. "There was a
  fellow named Thomas Ryde&mdash;a Harrow boy. I played against him for Eton.
  He was the first chap I ever saw bowl googlies&mdash;you know, Bosanquet came
  out with them later. Thomas Ryde, they called him&mdash;wiry little fellow,
  he was, father an accountant. He got a job out East somewhere when he left
  school, so I imagine his cricket went phut."</p>

  <p>"But how did you know that our Thomas Ryde had left here?" Sir Matthew
  persisted.</p>

  <p>"That was a sheer fluke," Dutley admitted, sitting on the arm of his
  chair, and swinging his leg backwards and forwards. "I was in a block in
  Queen Victoria Street the other day, and I saw a chap come out of an office
  building and hail a taxi. I knew his face was familiar, but I couldn't think
  where I'd seen him before. About an hour afterwards, when the whole thing had
  really gone out of my mind, I suddenly remembered that he was the man who
  spoke to you up here that day, and whom you called Thomas Ryde. I may be
  wrong about his having left, of course, but, seeing him wandering about with
  a bag in the City, I took it for granted that he had."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew held out his hand for the sheet and took up a pencil.</p>

  <p>"Thomas Ryde," he confided, "was sent down here first by a firm of
  accountants. He was one of those men who study office administration and
  effect economies. He wasn't really on our pay roll, which, I suppose, is why
  he was left out from the list. As a side line, he has an agency business now
  near Cannon Street. We let him have a lot of our old waste to sell. Number 6,
  Thugwell Row. There it is, you see. I've written it down for you."</p>

  <p>Dutley thrust the list indifferently into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Odd thing," he mused, "how these names stick to one sometimes.... What
  about a mouthful of lunch down at the Club? I suppose I'm still a
  member?"</p>

  <p>"Whether you are or not," Sir Matthew said, a little ponderously, as he
  rose to his feet, "it will be my pleasure to entertain you. I only wish that
  it were a more cheerful occasion."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DUTLEY indulged in a little grimace as his taxicab, that
  afternoon, turned into the spacious avenue leading to the home of Sir Matthew
  Parkinson. Notwithstanding its acres of conservatories, its imitation
  Elizabethan front, its spreading lawns, dotted with finely chosen shrubs, its
  fields dropping to the river below, Marlingthorpe House remained "a
  gentleman's residence, standing in its own grounds." Everything was
  extraordinarily neat. The parlour-maid who admitted him was of the best type,
  there was a smell of beeswax about the polished oak floor of the hall, a
  sense of everything being in its right place in the familiar rooms of which
  Dutley caught a glimpse as he was piloted to his destination. The little
  apartment, however, into which the maid showed him, was of a different
  character, untidy, faintly odoriferous of cigarette smoke, a few daring
  French sketches upon the wall, a heap of music upon a small grand piano, the
  most modern English and French periodicals lying without order on a round
  Chippendale table. A girl rose from the depths of an easy-chair to welcome
  him, and held out both her hands. He raised them to his lips.</p>

  <p>"Grace, my child," he beamed at her, "you grow prettier every day."</p>

  <p>She laughed at him and pushed him into a low chair by her side.</p>

  <p>"Some one has to keep up the looks of the family," she declared. "Dad's
  going off terribly. It is good of you to find time to come up, Charles."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't think of coming here without," he assured her.</p>

  <p>"Tea, or whisky and soda?"</p>

  <p>He preferred tea, and she rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"There are gaspers and Sullivans on the table there," she pointed out.
  "Help yourself."</p>

  <p>She lay back with her hands behind her head, curiously unlike her father,
  slim and fair and dainty, with grey-blue eyes, a rather low, clever forehead,
  and a delightfully sensitive mouth. She was dressed more for a semi-Bohemian
  Mayfair drawing-room than for a villa in Yorkshire.</p>

  <p>"A good trip?" she enquired.</p>

  <p>"Interesting," he admitted. "We didn't have much sport. I'd got most of
  the heads I wanted in the parts we went to. I did get one I was keen on
  having though, and the finest leopard I ever saw."</p>

  <p>"Had a few brushes with the natives, didn't you? I saw something of it in
  the papers."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"They're a wild lot," he said. "What have you been doing with
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, giving a month or two to duty down here, and knocking about the rest
  of the time," she answered, rather spiritlessly. "I went with Margaret
  Ritchies to Juan-les-Pins in July. That was rather fun."</p>

  <p>"Gay crowd, eh?"</p>

  <p>"A trifle advanced for my Yorkshire simplicity. Then we spent a month in
  Paris. I really thought of going back to stay with some friends at Rapallo,
  but dear old Mrs. Marsh&mdash;the Vicar's wife here, you know&mdash;wrote and
  told me that Dad was looking so ill that I thought I'd better come back.
  What's wrong at the Works, Charles?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that burglary was the devil of a nuisance. I suppose your father
  told you about the formula?"</p>

  <p>"He hasn't said much about it, but he seems very worried. He's been like
  this for a year. I made him go to a doctor, but it seems there's nothing
  wrong&mdash;nervous strain, and all that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>"Been seedy all that time, has he?" Dutley reflected. "Well, he couldn't
  have had anything to bother him until this show in July. Things at the Works
  were going splendidly up till then."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he was queer long before. What about the formula, Charles? I know
  we're not to talk about it, but it doesn't matter with you. Is Scotland Yard
  going to get it back?"</p>

  <p>"They haven't had much luck up till now."</p>

  <p>"Who do you think's got it?" she asked. "Really, for a business affair it
  sounds almost romantic."</p>

  <p>"Well, you know my general state of brainlessness," Dutley smiled
  deprecatingly. "I haven't had any inspiration about it, and I don't think
  your father has, either."</p>

  <p>Tea was brought in, and Grace roused herself to serve it. Afterwards, she
  sat upon the hearthrug with her hands clasped around her knees.</p>

  <p>"Charles," she confided. "I'm getting restless. Give me some good advice.
  What shall I do? This place stifles me. I hate the granite houses, and the
  macadamized roads, and the grey stoniness of it all."</p>

  <p>"Get married."</p>

  <p>"I'd love to," she admitted&mdash;"but to whom? I trot out religiously to
  the Hunt Balls, and tennis teas, and country-house cricket. I go everywhere
  I'm asked, with or without a chaperone, but nothing ever happens. I don't
  think I'm so very difficult, either. I don't like the local product round
  here, it's true, but there ought to be some one about with a
  <i>pied-&agrave;-terre</i> in London and a small country house somewhere, and
  a villa at Cannes. We're horribly rich, aren't we, Charles? This thing isn't
  going to make any real difference to the business? I can put up my share of
  anything still, can't I?"</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest doubt about it," he assured her confidently. "Your
  father's got the wind up, I think, and he's selling half his Boothroyd
  shares, but they can't go flop all of a sudden."</p>

  <p>"That's reassuring, at any rate," she murmured. "It's a pity about
  Lucille, you know, Charles. You might have married me."</p>

  <p>"You didn't develop quickly enough," he told her. "You were a
  boarding-school young lady when I lost my head about Lucille, and she's
  rather a dear, though I was terribly angry with her the other day."</p>

  <p>"That sounds hopeful. If ever there's a vacancy you'll put me on the list,
  won't you, Charles?"</p>

  <p>"My dear," he promised, "you will be the list."</p>

  <p>He rose from his chair, and selected a cigarette from the box.</p>

  <p>"Grace," he said, standing upon the hearthrug, and looking down at her,
  "this is between ourselves. I'm a little scared about your father."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean his health?" she asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"In a way, yes. But every one says he has been looking like this for the
  past twelve months. Now, when I left England, we'd had an enormous year. We
  paid a big dividend. I must have drawn from my shares something like sixty
  thousand pounds. Everything went on swimmingly until the burglary. Now your
  father's selling his shares as though he had nothing else to rely upon in the
  world. Not only that, but&mdash;how far are we pals, Grace?"</p>

  <p>She stooped and touched her toes&mdash;a long, graceful
  gesture&mdash;touched the top of her head, and resumed her former
  position.</p>

  <p>"<i>Voil&agrave;!</i>" she announced.</p>

  <p>"Not a word to your father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not a syllable."</p>

  <p>"Well, he's playing some game with me," Dutley told her.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"When I come to think of it, I scarcely know what I do mean," he
  confessed. "Of course I know I'm a perfect ass at that sort of thing, but I
  really did come up here with some kind of an idea of trying to find out what
  had become of the formula. Naturally I asked him some questions. It seems a
  quaint thing to say, Grace, but he really has attempted to deliberately
  mislead me on one or two points connected with the burglary. Why? What can be
  the object of it?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Charles," she remonstrated, "there could be no object in his
  doing anything of the sort. It's even more important for him to get the
  formula back than for you. The loss of it is worrying the life out of him. If
  he hasn't told you as much as you think he ought to have done, it is
  probably&mdash;you won't mind?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not."</p>

  <p>"It is probably because he doesn't think you would do any good by
  interfering."</p>

  <p>"Do you think it's that really?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed I do."</p>

  <p>He indulged in a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"I wonder why every one in Yorkshire always does, and always did, believe
  that I'm half a fool?"</p>

  <p>"If you lived in Yorkshire," she assured him, "you would know that it's
  only the fools, or the half fools, who are tolerable. The rest of them are
  picking one another's pockets all the time. Don't be angry with Dad, Charles,
  and don't get silly ideas about him. I expect he's really told you everything
  he knows, but, if he hasn't, it's simply because he thinks it best not
  to."</p>

  <p>"In that case," Dutley declared, glancing at the clock, "I will ask him no
  more questions. Put on your hat and come and see me off, Grace. I hate
  stepping into a railway train in cold blood."</p>

  <p>"Got a car?" she enquired.</p>

  <p>"No, a taxi, ticking up like blazes."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THEY found the train three-quarters of an hour late, and
  sauntered into the American Bar of the Hotel.</p>

  <p>"You must go back to-night, I suppose, Charles?" she asked. "You wouldn't
  like to stay and dine, and have it out with Dad? I'll take your part. After
  all, I don't see why you shouldn't know everything there is to be known."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I can't do that, Grace," he regretted, "and, remember, I don't want you
  to repeat a word I've said to your father. He's holding back something all
  right, but he probably has very good reasons. Don't press him. I'm not at all
  sure that he wouldn't be better left alone for a time. Why don't you come up
  to town? You've got your Club, and I'm always good for a meal."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I think I'd better stick it out here," she decided, a little drearily,
  "Father never opens his mouth to me, but I somehow feel that I ought to be
  around. Of course he may move up to London himself, and if he does I shall
  come along."</p>

  <p>It was a noisy, unromantic little place. The scattered groups of men
  standing about had one and all been engaged in some business deal or other.
  The majority were satisfied; a few here and there depressed. The two young
  people looked them over speculatively.</p>

  <p>"You're out of your milieu here, Grace," her companion said.</p>

  <p>"Don't I know it!" the girl rejoined bitterly. "What have I to do with
  this bargain-hunting, money-making crowd? If only this trouble at the Works
  could be cleared up, I think I'd get Father to let me have rooms in
  town."</p>

  <p>"Come and stay with Lucille," he suggested. "She'll put you up. That is,
  if she's forgiven me."</p>

  <p>"Did you behave very badly?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose I did&mdash;according to the modern standards," he confessed.
  "You know how hidebound we are about some things. A man annoys you before a
  woman, and you must go grim and white and tense, and hiss out words to the
  effect of&mdash;'Wait until I catch you alone!' Well, you see, a man annoyed
  me whilst Lucille was there, and I didn't wait. Just how seriously I'm in
  trouble, I don't quite know yet."</p>

  <p>A guard came in and made his way respectfully to Dutley.</p>

  <p>"The train is signalled, my lord," he announced. "I have arranged for your
  place."</p>

  <p>"I think, perhaps," Grace laughed, as she strolled out on to the platform
  with him, "that I had better wait and hear the result before I suggest
  quartering myself on Lucille."</p>

  <p>Outside, a drizzling rain was falling, and most of the passengers were
  standing back under shelter. With a shriek, as she crossed the points, the
  Scotchman came panting in, stabs of flame from her funnel mingling with the
  smoke. The guard and porter were fussing around them. Suddenly Grace caught
  her companion's arm.</p>

  <p>"Why, Charles," she cried, "isn't that Father?"</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew, tall and impressive in his fur coat, was suddenly disclosed
  under one of the rain-dimmed lamps. By his side, talking earnestly, and
  gesticulating with every sentence, was a tall, clean-shaven young man.</p>

  <p>"My God!" Dutley exclaimed, stepping back into the shadows. "And that's
  the fellow I knocked down at the Kentucky Club."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE dining-car attendant pushed open the door of Dutley's
  jealously guarded carriage as soon as they had left Sheffield.</p>

  <p>"Dinner, sir?" he enquired, brandishing the menu.</p>

  <p>Dutley beckoned him in.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," he begged, "is there a tall, clean-shaven young man, with very
  smooth black hair, rather like a foreigner, in the dining car?"</p>

  <p>The attendant smiled happily.</p>

  <p>"He was the first gentleman in, sir," he announced. "He's at a table near
  the door, drinking an <i>ap&eacute;ritif</i> now. He was with Sir Matthew
  Parkinson on the platform at Leeds. I seen them together directly the train
  drawed up."</p>

  <p>"Capital!" Dutley murmured, producing a ten-shilling note. "If I come
  along to dinner, do you think you could manage to put me&mdash;accidentally,
  mind&mdash;at the same table as this young man?"</p>

  <p>"Sure I could, sir," was the prompt response. "There is rather a crowd on
  the train to-night, and no one won't be able to have tables to
  themselves."</p>

  <p>The note changed hands. Dutley followed the attendant and seated himself
  where he was directed in the dining car. His curt exclamation when he found
  himself opposite De Brest was exceedingly well done. He half rose to his
  feet. The young man looked deprecatingly across at him.</p>

  <p>"There is no necessity for you to leave the table, Lord Dutley," he said.
  "I am willing to apologise for my behaviour the other evening."</p>

  <p>Dutley resumed his seat.</p>

  <p>"Not sure that it isn't I who ought to apologise," he acknowledged.</p>

  <p>De Brest waved the suggestion on one side.</p>

  <p>"I was too persistent," he confessed. "My admiration of Miss Bessiter was
  naturally an annoyance to you. I apologise."</p>

  <p>"All right," Dutley conceded. "We'll call it a wash-out. Split a bottle
  with our dinner, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I shall be very happy," the young man agreed.</p>

  <p>"Where have you come from?" Dutley enquired. "I didn't see you get in at
  Leeds."</p>

  <p>De Brest hesitated. He came to the conclusion, however, that Dutley was
  speaking the truth, as indeed he was.</p>

  <p>"I have come from Glasgow," he confided.</p>

  <p>Dutley felt a little thrill, although there was no evidence of it in his
  expression. De Brest was lying. For what purpose? What was there of secrecy
  in his visit to Sir Matthew?</p>

  <p>"Beastly place," he murmured vacantly. "The wine list, waiter."</p>

  <p>"The most unattractive of all your British cities," the Baron agreed.
  "Nevertheless, it boasts a Stock Exchange, and several banking houses of
  repute are established there. My visit was merely a matter of an hour or
  so."</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything of Leeds?"</p>

  <p>"Very little. Your English towns outside of London interest me only when
  it is a question of money-making. I have no connections in Leeds. In Glasgow
  I have relations with a bank and several shipping firms."</p>

  <p>"It's a dirty hole, but there's plenty of money to be made in Leeds,"
  Dutley volunteered.</p>

  <p>"You should certainly know that, Lord Dutley. When I met you at dinner, I
  did not at first understand that you were the son of the founder of
  Boothroyds. You are to be congratulated. It is a magnificent enterprise."</p>

  <p>"Not much to do with me, I am afraid," Dutley regretted. "We have a Board
  of Directors, of which I am supposed to be Chairman, but since my father's
  death Sir Matthew Parkinson has practically run the whole show. Happen to
  know him, by-the-by?"</p>

  <p>"I have some slight acquaintance with Sir Matthew," the other
  acknowledged, after a brief hesitation. "A capital man of business, without a
  doubt."</p>

  <p>"Most Yorkshiremen are shrewd," Dutley remarked. "Sir Matthew has a great
  reputation as a financier, I believe. Never took to business myself. My brain
  wasn't fashioned that way."</p>

  <p>There was a gleam of skilfully veiled contempt in the Baron's at times
  unpleasant-looking eyes.</p>

  <p>"It is fortunate that we are not all built in a similar manner," he said.
  "To me, business is a great joy&mdash;banking business especially."</p>

  <p>"Where are your headquarters?"</p>

  <p>"In Amsterdam. I have agencies in most of the cities of Europe. Nothing
  makes me happier than when I am engaged in floating a loan for some of my
  friends, or helping them to invest their funds to advantage. Money-making,"
  De Brest went on thoughtfully, "is so easy when one understands the game. It
  is worth while, too. However much one has it is always possible to find a use
  for a little more."</p>

  <p>"Quite true," Dutley agreed.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," the Baron reflected, "that you have never thought of a little
  judicious speculation."</p>

  <p>"Never occurred to me," was the indifferent reply. "I'm afraid I haven't
  the brain for that sort of thing. Besides, Boothroyds pays me pretty well. I
  don't suppose I could get much larger dividends anywhere."</p>

  <p>"Or greater safety," the Baron observed. "Nevertheless, it is one of the
  axioms of finance that you should not have, as you say in England, all your
  eggs in one basket."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," Dutley reflected, "every great firm must have its ups and
  downs. I've just come from the Works. We're not doing quite so well now."</p>

  <p>Again there was a gleam in De Brest's eyes which spoke of his
  interest.</p>

  <p>"That may account," he said, "for the way your shares have dropped in the
  market to-day and yesterday. Closing price in Glasgow to-day was
  seventy-three."</p>

  <p>"That's the devil of a drop!"</p>

  <p>"It is a very severe fall for so firmly established a company. Of course,
  you may resent my advice, Lord Dutley. You have acknowledged, though, that
  you are not a business man. Very well then. You are a large holder of
  Boothroyds. Where are your share certificates, by-the-by?"</p>

  <p>"Deposited at my Bank."</p>

  <p>"Against an overdraft or anything?"</p>

  <p>Dutley shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm fairly extravagant," he said, "but I've never managed to quite spend
  the dividends on five hundred thousand shares."</p>

  <p>"Five hundred thousand shares!" the Baron repeated in an awed tone. "An
  amazing holding! Now, let me show you, Lord Dutley, how to make a little
  money. Deposit with your bankers as security, say a hundred thousand pounds'
  worth of your shares, borrow that amount on them&mdash;you would be able to
  do so at something very little over bank rate&mdash;and with the money you
  borrow buy shares, or take an interest in some investment companies where you
  could easily make ten per cent. Five per cent., you see, is clear profit. You
  have nothing to risk, no inconveniences, and you don't sell any shares."</p>

  <p>"Sounds like a spot of all right," Dutley admitted.</p>

  <p>"Of course it's all right," De Brest went on, trying hard to retain his
  pose of good-natured indifference. "There are half a dozen perfectly safe
  things you could come in to where you could be practically guaranteed ten per
  cent. with the possibility of twenty."</p>

  <p>"As, for example?"</p>

  <p>The Baron refilled his companion's glass and smiled. He was thinking just
  at that moment that there was no man in the world whom it would make him
  happier to strip of every penny he possessed than the man opposite.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I couldn't answer your question off-hand like that, Lord
  Dutley," he said. "If any one comes to me in my capacity as a banker, with
  money to invest, why that's a different matter, but one can't give away all
  one's good things in response to a casual enquiry, you see. We might part at
  St. Pancras. You might decide not to bother your head with business affairs.
  Next time you were with friends, like the Bessiters, for instance, who are
  interested in finance, our conversation would occur to you, and you would
  say, naturally enough: 'Oh, I heard of a good thing the other day&mdash;so
  and so.' Your friends&mdash;especially if they knew that the tip came from
  me&mdash;would probably buy. Up would go the price, and our little
  conversation would have cost me more than a trifle. Now you get the business
  man's attitude, Lord Dutley."</p>

  <p>"I quite see," Dutley agreed. "After all, it doesn't matter much, does it?
  We've both got all we want without worrying to make it a bit more."</p>

  <p>"A banker never has all he wants," De Brest said earnestly. "Remember
  that, Lord Dutley, because it is important. The possibilities of finance are
  illimitable. The banker who has fifty million under his control can use
  another ten million with five minutes' notice. Money is in demand all over
  the world for industrial and financial purposes. The only thing is to choose
  the place where the greatest margin exists between the interest you have to
  pay and the interest you can arrange to receive."</p>

  <p>"Quite," Dutley observed, a little vaguely. "Smoke?"</p>

  <p>The two men lit cigars. The Baron refused a liqueur, but Dutley ordered a
  <i>fin</i>.</p>

  <p>"Jolly interesting life, yours," he went on, "so long as you have a taste
  for it. I suppose you get to know a good deal about different sorts of
  businesses?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly I do," De Brest assented. "I even know something about yours,
  and that is almost the most complicated manufacturing business in the
  world."</p>

  <p>"You know more about it than I do, I expect."</p>

  <p>"Very likely. Anyhow, I know the value of it. The chemistry is a bit
  beyond me. I know that it takes many years before you can turn out the right
  thing in artificial silk, because I have financed one or two of the smaller
  continental companies myself and I have had to wait quite a long time for my
  money. It generally came right in the end, though. I suppose," he added,
  looking intently at the ash of his cigar, "even a huge business like yours,
  as you were saying, has its ups and downs?"</p>

  <p>"Bound to have," Dutley acknowledged. "I'm an ignoramus, of course, but
  I've been trying to rub that in to Sir Matthew. He's got the hump because
  things aren't going very well at the Works. I've been trying to cheer him up.
  We've been making the goods for so long now that it isn't likely we're going
  to lose the knack of it all at once."</p>

  <p>De Brest's assent was whole-hearted, but his smile was enigmatic. Dutley
  called for his bill, insisted upon paying for the champagne, and returned to
  his carriage with a little nod of farewell. He stretched himself out in a
  corner and, with an evening paper on his knee, settled down to an hour's
  reflection. No one who might have intruded upon his solitude could have
  imagined him engaged in very profound thought. Not a line of his face was
  wrinkled. His pleasant blue eyes were entirely untroubled. Yet, very slowly
  before them was growing into shape the first phase of an amazing and
  incongruous possibility.</p>

  <p>The train rushed through the night into the suburbs of London, a vast
  field of lights on each side. The door was suddenly opened. Dutley's fingers
  strayed to his waistcoat pocket for his ticket, but it was the Baron de Brest
  who stood there, his hat and overcoat on, all ready to alight.</p>

  <p>"Referring to our very agreeable conversation, Lord Dutley," he said, "if
  my proposal for numbering you amongst my investing clients should commend
  itself to you, I would like you to accept my card. We might lunch some time
  together at the Milan Grill."</p>

  <p>"Very kind of you," Dutley replied, glancing at the card, and placing it
  carefully in his pocket. "I hate bothering about business, but I'm glad to
  know where you are to be found, at any rate."</p>

  <p>"Within the next few days," De Brest continued impressively, moving a
  little further into the carriage, and holding on to the rack, "I have to make
  up my mind whether I advance to a new but very promising enterprise a
  considerable sum of money. Any one with a hundred thousand pounds to spare,
  could rely upon making something like fourteen per cent. upon his investment
  in a very short time. Will you think this over, Lord Dutley?"</p>

  <p>"I will indeed."</p>

  <p>"The only trouble is," De Brest concluded, lighting a cigarette, and
  speaking with somewhat forced nonchalance, "that I have to decide by
  Thursday. Afterwards it would probably be too late. You have my address. If
  you think anything of the matter, let me know, and we will arrange a
  meeting."</p>

  <p>"A bite of lunch at the Milan, eh?" Dutley murmured. "I won't forget,
  Baron. Very good of you to think of me."</p>

  <p>De Brest hesitated, as though he had something more to say, but whatever
  it was he left it unsaid. Dutley watched him as he closed the door and made
  his way down the corridor. His lips relaxed a little. He permitted himself to
  smile.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"WHAT on earth does this denote?" Dutley enquired, about
  half an hour later, as he stood and looked around in Lucille's sitting room.
  "A funeral, or what sort of a celebration?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be an idiot, Charles," Lucille replied, with a little frown.</p>

  <p>He waved his hand towards the banks of orchids and vases of tuberoses.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear child!" he expostulated. "Why this floral display? Why this
  perfume of altar cloths and the funeral department of a florist's shop?"</p>

  <p>"Orchids and tuberoses happen to be my favourite flowers," Lucille
  declared severely&mdash;"as you seem to have forgotten since your
  return."</p>

  <p>"Some one's been spoiling you," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"The flowers came from Sigismund de Brest," Lucille announced, with a note
  of defiance in her voice.</p>

  <p>"The deuce they did! Must have cost him an awful lot," Dutley speculated,
  eyeing them critically.</p>

  <p>"I suppose he can afford them."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps."</p>

  <p>"In any case," Lucille continued, "it's the thought I value. In the course
  of quite an ordinary conversation, I happened to tell him how much I liked
  tuberoses."</p>

  <p>"He could afford the thought no doubt."</p>

  <p>"And why do you think he couldn't afford the flowers?"</p>

  <p>"My dear, I know nothing about him," was Dutley's dry acknowledgment. "He
  may be a millionaire. A great many people say so&mdash;amongst whom himself.
  I know nothing about financiers or their habits. I hope I haven't kept you in
  from a party?"</p>

  <p>"Only a stupid one. Where have you been to all day?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I had dinner with your friend, the generous donor of floral
  offerings, an hour ago."</p>

  <p>Lucille raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Impossible, my dear Charles. Sigismund went up to Leeds this morning
  early. He sent me a note to say so."</p>

  <p>"So it was Leeds," Dutley murmured. "Well, well! Anyhow, you see, I
  happened to be there too this afternoon, and we came back on the same
  train."</p>

  <p>"I think it was very nice of him to have dinner with you," she remarked.
  "Please leave off wandering round the room and sit down. Come and sit on the
  sofa if you want to. Would you like some coffee?"</p>

  <p>"Had it on the train, thanks. I'll have a whisky and soda later. So De
  Brest sent you all these flowers! A declared admirer, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be stupid! He's been that for a long time. What did you go to Leeds
  for?"</p>

  <p>"Just to have a look at the Works&mdash;make sure that the wheels were
  going round, you know&mdash;incidentally to see Grace."</p>

  <p>"How is she?"</p>

  <p>"She's all right in health, I think, but she is very bored, very
  discontented, and very worried about her father."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with Sir Matthew?"</p>

  <p>Dutley polished his eyeglass carefully.</p>

  <p>"I don't know yet," he confided. "I shall find out presently. I say,
  you're not thinking of chucking me for this fellow De Brest, are you?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd!"</p>

  <p>"Well, it does seem rather a silly notion. I may not be so decorative, but
  I'm a much better sort of fellow than he is."</p>

  <p>Lucille drew herself a little away from her companion's encircling
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Are you indeed? What have you done in the world, I should like to
  know?"</p>

  <p>"Come to that&mdash;what's he done?"</p>

  <p>"He's made a great deal of money entirely on his own initiative," Lucille
  affirmed. "He told me only yesterday that his father was a poor man. The day
  he made his first million, he flew over to Amsterdam and bought the house his
  father and mother lived in. He's having it furnished for when he's at
  home."</p>

  <p>"Very sporting of him," Dutley murmured. "I wonder what he'll do when he
  makes his second."</p>

  <p>"You're impossible!" Lucille exclaimed, almost angrily. "I admire success
  in any man, and it's no use your being grumpy about Siggie de Brest because
  if he likes to send me flowers I shall accept them, and if I want to see him
  I shall."</p>

  <p>"I don't mean to lose sight of him myself."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. We're the greatest possible pals. He is going to make a fortune
  for me if I behave nicely and pawn my shares."</p>

  <p>"There isn't going to be any more nonsense, is there?"</p>

  <p>"Not likely. Let's drop the young man for a time. I've had an hour and a
  half in the railway train with him. I'd rather&mdash;just tell you how
  charming you're looking."</p>

  <p>Her hands caressed his cheek for a moment. She looked searchingly into his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"You've changed somehow the last day or two, Charles," she said. "What's
  the matter? You're not worrying, or anything, are you?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated. For a single moment, he found himself wishing that it were
  Grace inviting his confidence. Lucille would be properly sympathetic, of
  course, but there wasn't one chance in a thousand that she would really
  understand the black thoughts which were haunting his brain.</p>

  <p>"I'm all right," he assured her. "London's a bit strange to me, you
  know&mdash;London clothes, manners, habits, and everything. If you'd spent
  several months in a shirt&mdash;not the same shirt&mdash;and a pair of riding
  breeches, with a spot of trouble about most days, it would make you sort of
  jumpy to get back here with a policeman at every turn, and even the dogs
  muzzled. Where's Ronnie to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Staying in because I told him that you were coming. He said he wanted to
  see you."</p>

  <p>A servant made a discreet entrance with whisky and soda. Lucille turned
  towards him.</p>

  <p>"Tell Mr. Ronald that Lord Dutley is here," she directed.</p>

  <p>"Would you like me to go back and change, and have an hour at the
  Embassy?" Dutley suggested.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Not to-night, I think. You look a little tired, and a night off won't do
  me any harm."</p>

  <p>Ronnie presently made his appearance. His prospective brother-in-law
  welcomed him with a scowl.</p>

  <p>"I say, what are you knocking my shares about like this for?" he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>The young man was for him grave. He sat on the edge of the table with his
  hands in his trousers pockets.</p>

  <p>"No one understands what's happening, Charles," he confided. "To tell you
  the truth, I wondered whether you could tell us anything? You've just got
  back from the Works, I hear. There are all sorts of rumours about."</p>

  <p>"As, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"Well, they say that since your chemist was shot, your people haven't made
  the right stuff, and that there's a lot of spoilt merchandise to come on the
  market. The shares were down to seventy-two at five o'clock. They rallied a
  little, but closed weakish, at seventy-three. If this goes on, your Board
  will have to issue a statement."</p>

  <p>"Why should we?"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow!" Ronnie remonstrated. "What about your shareholders?
  Think of the cold shivers you're giving them. Naturally, they want to know if
  there's anything wrong. Apart from all that," the young man went on, after a
  brief hesitation, "before you issue the statement, there's the personal side
  of the matter. You don't want your pals to be left in the cart, do you? If
  you could really give us some definite information, it would help us a lot.
  We handle a great deal of your stock, you know, and clients have been ringing
  us up all day."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I could tell you any more than you know already, Ronnie,"
  Dutley decided, after a moment's reflection.</p>

  <p>The young man changed his position impatiently.</p>

  <p>"But I say," he expostulated, "surely you can tell me, for instance, as a
  pal, whether it's true about all this bad stuff, and how long it's going on?
  We don't know where we are. I don't mind telling you that we've had a very
  formidable 'bear' account opened against Boothroyds in the last few
  days&mdash;a pool, I think it is, run by a very shrewd financier. Then I told
  you about the little man who came and tried to start one with us. I heard
  quite incidentally that he'd opened one with Hartupps, and no small one
  either. Ever heard of him, I wonder? Thomas Ryde his name is."</p>

  <p>Dutley, who was neat-fingered as a rule, was unexpectedly clumsy. He
  dropped his cigarette upon the floor. He recovered it, however,
  immediately.</p>

  <p>"I seem to have heard the name," he replied, stooping to brush the
  cigarette ash from his trousers. "I don't know the man."</p>

  <p>"Well, where does he get his information from, I wonder?" Ronnie
  speculated.</p>

  <p>He slipped from his place, poured some whisky into a glass and added a
  splash of soda water. He passed the tumbler to Dutley and mixed another drink
  for himself.</p>

  <p>"I think you'd better have a talk to Dad before you go, Charles," he
  continued. "A fall of over ten shillings in shares like Boothroyds is enough
  to upset the whole market. Before you leave, though, I'll tell you something
  else that will surprise you. You know that Sir Matthew was up the other
  day?"</p>

  <p>Dutley nodded.</p>

  <p>"He came to see me."</p>

  <p>"Well, he's selling shares&mdash;Boothroyd shares&mdash;selling them for
  delivery, not on an account. Not many people know that fortunately, or things
  would be even worse. The Managing Director of the firm! What do you think of
  that, Charles?"</p>

  <p>"I knew it," was the quiet acknowledgment.</p>

  <p>"You knew that Sir Matthew was selling shares?"</p>

  <p>"He was perfectly honest. He came up to town to tell me so."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. The young man opened and shut his cigarette
  case with a snap. A servant entered the room with a note on a salver, which
  he carried across to Lucille.</p>

  <p>"A district messenger is waiting for a reply, Miss," he announced.</p>

  <p>Lucille tore open the envelope. She sat for a moment afterwards thinking.
  Then she rose to her feet, and came over to Dutley.</p>

  <p>"Can you guess whom my note is from?" she asked. "It's from Sigismund de
  Brest."</p>

  <p>"Sigismund, eh? More flowers?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly! How could he send flowers at this time of the night? He
  wants me to lunch at the Ritz to-morrow to meet his aunt, the Princess
  Enterfelt, and his brother."</p>

  <p>"Quite a family party," Dutley observed.</p>

  <p>"You don't want me to go?"</p>

  <p>"I want you to do whatever you'd like to do," he assured her. "I'm afraid
  I've already disclosed my feelings towards the young man, but I'm not
  old-fashioned enough to attempt to thrust my prejudices upon any one
  else."</p>

  <p>"I should rather like to meet the Princess," Lucille admitted tentatively.
  "She gives wonderful parties at Deauville in the summer."</p>

  <p>"De Brest is becoming quite an important client of ours," Ronnie put
  in.</p>

  <p>"In which case, please don't hesitate," Dutley begged.</p>

  <p>Lucille turned away, and scribbled a reply, which she handed to the
  servant. Dutley glanced at the clock, and rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"If I'm going to pay my respects to your father," he said, "I think I
  ought to be getting along."</p>

  <p>"Come back and say good night to me if I'm up," Lucille invited, as the
  two young men left the room.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bessiter was, apparently, not in the best of tempers. He was a
  handsome man, still in the fifties, with a quick, nervous manner which at
  times ran to irritability.</p>

  <p>"How are you, Charles&mdash;how are you?" he welcomed him. "Did you go up
  to Leeds?"</p>

  <p>"Got back this evening, sir," Dutley replied, sinking into an
  easy-chair.</p>

  <p>"I'm very glad to see you, very relieved," Mr. Bessiter confided. "I
  suppose you've seen the papers. There's a regular run against Boothroyds. The
  bears are rampant. Couldn't have believed such a thing possible. What's it
  all about? Do you know what Boothroyds finished up at to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I heard," Dutley acknowledged. "Somewhere about seventy-two or
  three, eh?"</p>

  <p>"And weak at that. Furthermore, as well as the' bear' account which one of
  our own clients has opened against you, people who ought to know are
  absolutely selling the shares for delivery in large blocks."</p>

  <p>"I've told Charles about Sir Matthew," Ronnie put in.</p>

  <p>"Well, there you are then," his father continued, sitting up in his place.
  "I've got to ask you a straight question, Charles. Tell us what's wrong, for
  heaven's sake! Your own Managing Director selling his shares as fast as he
  can! The position's incredible."</p>

  <p>Dutley was looking almost as worried as he felt. He helped himself to the
  inevitable consolation, a cigarette, and took a gulp of the whisky and soda
  which he had brought with him from the other room.</p>

  <p>"I think I know what the idea is," he announced at last, "but as to
  telling you exactly what it is that's wrong&mdash;well, I don't know. I'm
  afraid I can't do that."</p>

  <p>There was an ominous silence. It was perfectly obvious that Mr. Bessiter
  senior was becoming slowly very angry indeed. Ronnie, on the other hand, was
  a little staggered. The situation was beyond him. It was his father who spoke
  at last, with great deliberation.</p>

  <p>"You know what is wrong with the affairs of your house, Dutley, you know
  that we are involved on behalf of clients both ways, and you decline to take
  us into your confidence."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that's about it," Dutley acknowledged. "You see, I've come
  into this mess rather unexpectedly, and it's taken me some time to adjust my
  bearings, but I do see this&mdash;a man like myself, who by inheritance owns
  part of a great business, to the workings of which the public have entrusted
  their money, has to think first and always of those people. You're both my
  dear friends. I am hoping to become connected with your family. That does not
  affect the matter. I do not think you must ask me questions my answer to
  which might prejudice the position of shareholders in the firm."</p>

  <p>"My God!" Mr. Bessiter muttered hopelessly.</p>

  <p>"Charles, are you crazy?" Ronnie exclaimed. "Have you gone off the deep
  end altogether? We're not living in the Middle Ages. Surely you can answer a
  few simple questions?"</p>

  <p>"I would rather not answer the question you have put to me."</p>

  <p>Mr. Bessiter helped himself to a stiff drink. He placed the tumbler by his
  side, and deliberately filled a pipe.</p>

  <p>"Dutley," he said, "I have always looked upon you as an amiable and a
  likable young fellow. My daughter happens to approve of you, and I shall be
  delighted to welcome you into the family, but I tell you frankly I don't want
  Lucille to marry either a Quixote or a fool. We have come up against a
  question where our interests are vital. After hours this evening, we received
  by telegram from Leeds, which is practically your headquarters, an order to
  sell Boothroyds from opening time until closing time to-morrow at such prices
  as the jobbers will make. This comes from a client who is already interested
  in the pool Ronnie has probably told you about, who has an international
  reputation as a shrewd financier, and whose cheques we have seen honoured for
  hundreds of thousands of pounds. What is behind that commission, Charles
  Dutley? What do you suppose we are going to do?"</p>

  <p>"Carry out your client's instructions, if you are sure he is a sound man
  and that you will make money by doing so," was Dutley's calm advice. "I can't
  help you."</p>

  <p>"But can't you see," Mr. Bessiter insisted, "that when a clever man sends
  us an order like that it must be that he has some special inside knowledge?
  He must know that Boothroyds is going down. If he knows it, you must know it
  too. Why not own up? You can do no good amongst your friends by adopting this
  attitude. We want to help you. I'd like to help you get out&mdash;help you to
  get a decent price on a portion of your shares, at any rate. You must
  remember that, coupled with all this, we know through a private source that
  Sir Matthew, although he's too clever to come to us, is selling his shares
  through half a dozen brokers."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's all beyond me," Dutley acknowledged, rising to his feet. "If
  you don't mind, I'll say good night."</p>

  <p>"You're not going away like this?" Mr. Bessiter exclaimed, the anger
  flaming in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I don't see what else to do," was the despairing reply. "If I happen to
  know any secrets connected with my firm, simply because I am Chairman of the
  Directors and have a right to know them, I can't tell you what they are for
  market purposes, because that's what it amounts to, as I see it. I may be
  wrong&mdash;I know you think I'm a fool, and I probably am&mdash;but you see
  it comes to a man now and then in life that he's got to do what he thinks is
  right, whether he's making a mistake or not. I haven't a word to say to you,
  except good night. Don't bother to come to the door, Ronnie, unless you want
  to."</p>

  <p>Dutley crossed the room with that sudden, stealthily swift stride of his,
  which he had learnt in the East. Bessiter looked after him with cold fury in
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're not such a fool as you look," he spat out. "Perhaps you
  think you can get rid of your shares better through another market."</p>

  <p>Dutley turned back from the door.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Bessiter," he said, "I am thankful that you have made one statement
  to which I can reply. I own five hundred thousand shares in Boothroyds
  Limited. I have not sold a single one, nor do I propose to do so."</p>

  <p>Mr. Bessiter dropped his pipe. Ronnie stared at the closed door with open
  mouth. The next thing they heard was Dutley's clear voice in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Johnson, no. If Miss Lucille's gone upstairs, I won't wait. No
  taxi, thanks. I see it isn't raining. I'd rather walk home."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"BURDETT," his master confided, as he lit his
  after-breakfast pipe on the following morning, "we're off again."</p>

  <p>In spirit the man groaned. Nine months in Abyssinia, which he loathed, and
  barely three days in London, which he adored! Well-trained servant though he
  was, his face fell.</p>

  <p>"Very good, my lord," he said. "Where to, and what sort of kit?"</p>

  <p>"I shall require," Dutley explained, "two ready-made suits of clothes, not
  ridiculously ill-fitting, but of cheap material, a bowler hat and a cap,
  linen to match, boots which must have some sort of a rubber sole."</p>

  <p>Burdett stared at his master.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite understand, my lord," he confessed. "Do you wish me to
  procure these things?"</p>

  <p>"I do, and before eleven o'clock. This little adventure into which we are
  tumbling, Burdett, will not greatly concern you. You will, as a matter of
  fact, spend the greater part of your time here."</p>

  <p>Burdett tried to conceal his pleasure, although his sense of bewilderment
  had rather increased.</p>

  <p>"I'll go straight to a ready-made place in the Strand for the clothes, my
  lord," he said. "You'll perhaps give me further instructions when I
  return."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever hear, Burdett, of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde?"</p>

  <p>"Can't say that I did, my lord," the man admitted, puzzled. "There was a
  Bob Hyde who kept the Sun Inn in High Street."</p>

  <p>"These were creatures of fiction," Dutley explained&mdash;"the same man
  really, inhabiting two personalities. Do you follow that, Burdett?"</p>

  <p>"No, my lord."</p>

  <p>Dutley scratched his chin for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Somehow I didn't think you would," he remarked, "but what is going to
  happen is this, Burdett. I'm out on an adventure, here in London, and whilst
  I'm engaged in it I shall arrive here at all hours of the day or night, and,
  so far as any visitors are concerned, I shall be out of town. It will be your
  duty to keep the servants from talking and to be on hand to receive me at all
  times. You understand that?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, my lord."</p>

  <p>"To continue. When you have brought me the clothes, you will take for me
  what is, I believe, known as a bed-sitting room, and a bathroom if possible,
  right down in the City, in the neighbourhood of Thugwell Row, near Cannon
  Street. Better get a room for yourself there, too, in case I want you
  occasionally. Charles Dennis, my name is, and if it is possible to get hip
  pockets in the two suits of clothes, do so."</p>

  <p>Burdett looked grave.</p>

  <p>"Is this going to be a job of that sort, my lord?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"I'm rather afraid it may turn out so," his master answered. "There's a
  very unpleasant man going about I want to keep my eye on."</p>

  <p>"You'll pardon me, my lord, but, in this country, wouldn't it be better to
  leave an affair of that sort to the police?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally it would," Dutley acknowledged, "but you see in this case,
  Burdett, although I can't say that I'm up against the police, we're both
  working from a different angle, and for different ends. They'd spoil my
  pitch, and I should probably queer theirs if we worked together."</p>

  <p>"But surely, my lord," Burdett ventured, "if it is a criminal, or
  criminals, you want to track down, you wouldn't&mdash;forgive me, my
  lord&mdash;have a chance against the police with all their detective
  force."</p>

  <p>"I pass over the insinuation, Burdett," Dutley remarked, with a twinkle in
  his eye, "but you see there's just one thing you can pit against skill and
  brains every time&mdash;that's luck. And, concerning this matter, Burdett,
  just a slight stroke of luck has put me on the track of two at least of the
  men I want. If I handed over my information to the police, however, they'd
  probably make excellent use of it, but I should never get what I'm after.
  That's why I'm thinking of working alone. Is the car there?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, my lord."</p>

  <p>Dutley rose and knocked out his pipe.</p>

  <p>"I'm going round to the gunsmith's," he announced. "Back in an hour if any
  one wants me."</p>

  <p>"You'll give me full instructions about letters and replies to enquiries
  and such things, later, my lord?" the man suggested.</p>

  <p>"When I come back."</p>

  <p>"And you'll forgive me, but, if this business is going to lead to any
  scrapping, hadn't I better stick close, and let Mrs. Bulwell and Robert look
  after the house? We've got out of a good many tight corners together, my
  lord, but it's needed two of us sometimes."</p>

  <p>"Quite right," Dutley acquiesced. "I may have to pull you in, Burdett, but
  just at present I'm doing a little scouting first, you see, before I make my
  pounce."</p>

  <p>The man coughed slightly.</p>

  <p>"You don't think, my lord," he ventured apologetically, "that you being
  good enough at a scrap when all's clear ahead, but not being used to this
  hole-in-the-corner business, the other side might do the pouncing if they got
  to know what you were after?"</p>

  <p>Dutley nodded.</p>

  <p>"It's a perfectly sound idea. In fact, it has already occurred to me.
  Hence the second-hand clothes, hence an impending visit to Clarkson's. Back
  in an hour, Burdett...."</p>

  <p>Dutley was an excellent customer of the gunsmith to whom he presently
  drove, and who hastened forward to greet him at his entrance. Dutley swung
  himself on to the counter and engaged in general conversation for a few
  minutes.</p>

  <p>"I have been through your armoury, my lord," the man announced. "Two of
  the heavier rifles seem to have been rather badly used, but on the whole
  everything is in pretty good condition. Are you thinking of starting out
  again already?"</p>

  <p>"Not just yet. I came to the conclusion though, Chester, once or twice
  when I was in rather tight corners, that my revolver practice needed
  improving, and that my weapons were a little old-fashioned. Will you show me
  the latest thing you have in small but powerful revolvers, as flat as
  possible for a hip pocket?"</p>

  <p>The man reflected.</p>

  <p>"If you want a weapon for your usual sort of work, my lord," he said, "I
  don't see how you can do better than your Colt."</p>

  <p>"But I don't happen to want that sort of thing at all," Dutley confided,
  lighting a cigarette. "I want you to do as you've always done, Chester," he
  added, glancing casually but with a certain amount of meaning at the man. "I
  want you to supply me with what I require, ask no questions, and forget it.
  Automatics, I'm afraid, would be too cumbersome. I want two revolvers,
  sensitive but deadly weapons&mdash;something I can get up my sleeve if I want
  to, something more for civilised work."</p>

  <p>"I can give you the pattern they're using in Chicago so much," the
  gunmaker observed, going behind his counter, "They're deadly little weapons,
  and we don't sell them to every one. The police are thinking of adopting
  them, I believe."</p>

  <p>Dutley made his selection and strolled into the shooting gallery, where
  the gunsmith watched his efforts with admiration.</p>

  <p>"There's not many an American gunman could spot my target like that, my
  lord," he said. "Have you ever tried a quick draw?"</p>

  <p>The bullet was in the bull's eye of the target almost before he could
  finish his speech.</p>

  <p>"It's almost the best shooting I've ever seen for this class of weapon, my
  lord," the man admitted.</p>

  <p>"Almost?" Dutley murmured. "I'm rather conceited about my short-range
  weapons, you know, Chester."</p>

  <p>"With good cause, too, my lord, but there was a little man came in here
  some time ago, wanted very much what you asked for&mdash;a prim little figure
  of a man, with gold-rimmed spectacles, and a precise manner. You wouldn't
  think he'd ever let off a gun in his life to look at him. He bought one of
  those, and one a trifle larger. I took him into the shooting gallery, and my
  eyes pretty nearly dropped out of my head. It was almost trick shooting. It
  was just one better than yours, my lord."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. Dutley seemed to be looking away into
  vacancy. Poor Rentoul! Through the heart! The watchman&mdash;through the
  heart again! Never a chance, either of them.</p>

  <p>"What did a man of that type want guns for?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"Said he was cashier at some large works, my lord," the gunmaker
  explained. "He often had an immense sum of money to get from the town for
  wages."</p>

  <p>"Ah, I see! And a better shot than I am, curse him! You don't remember his
  name, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>The gunmaker fetched down his daybook.</p>

  <p>"It's here somewhere, my lord," he said. "He was in for some ammunition
  not long ago. Here you are. Thomas Ryde, The Towers, 118 Greenwall
  Avenue."</p>

  <p>"Very interesting," Dutley murmured. "Well, good morning, Chester."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3><br>

  <p class="first">BACK in his room, Dutley was examining Burdett's purchases
  when the telephone bell rang.</p>

  <p>"Miss Grace Parkinson to speak to you, my lord," the latter announced.</p>

  <p>Dutley took the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Grace, you up in town?... Of course you can see me.... What are
  you worried about, old dear?... Quite right. No secrets down the telephone.
  What about a spot of lunch?... Yes, I'm free all right. Lucille's lunching
  with members of the Dutch aristocracy. Ritz Grill at one
  o'clock&mdash;downstairs, mind. We don't want to run into Royalty."</p>

  <p>He hung up the receiver and glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"You'd better see about those rooms this afternoon, Burdett," he enjoined.
  "I'll move in to-night, I think. If any one asks for me, say I'm preparing to
  go out of town. And, Burdett?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

  <p>"Do you know where Greenwall Avenue is?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord. Up Highgate way."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll change my mind about those rooms," Dutley announced. "Try up
  there. Healthier neighbourhood, I should think&mdash;plenty of fresh air and
  that sort of thing. Try as nearly opposite a house called The Towers as
  possible."</p>

  <p>"I will make enquiries in that direction, my lord," Burdett promised.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3><br>

  <p class="first">GRACE was already waiting in the downstairs lounge of the
  Ritz when Dutley arrived. She leaned forward, and held out her hands, a slim,
  graceful figure, adorably neat in her simple but elegant clothes, and
  fashionable little hat. He felt a curious thrill as he realised the pleasure
  in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You are a dear to come," she said, "and what luck you were able to!"</p>

  <p>"Stroke of luck for me," he agreed. "What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing much, I suppose," she replied. "Still, life all seems so jumpy
  nowadays. You know we saw Father on the platform last night, talking to some
  young man?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I remember that," he acknowledged. "I remember the young man
  too."</p>

  <p>"Well, directly the train had gone, I looked everywhere for Father, but
  he'd left. At home, I waited for dinner, and he didn't turn up. Just as I was
  going to bed, a taxicab man arrived with a note to Miller, the manservant, to
  take his clothes. There was just a message for me to say that he'd had to
  come up to London by the mail."</p>

  <p>"Great Scot!" Dutley observed, summoning a waiter, and ordering cocktails.
  "What a queer thing. He never said a word to me about coming."</p>

  <p>"Well, what I felt was," Grace went on, "that as I'm only down in Leeds to
  look after him, if he chooses to come up to London, I thought I might come
  too. So here I am. But that isn't the queerest part of it."</p>

  <p>"It's the pleasantest part anyway," Dutley declared.</p>

  <p>"You dear!" she murmured, patting his hand. "Now, listen. You know, don't
  you, that for thirty years Father has never stayed anywhere except at the
  Midland Hotel. We've all begged him to change for the West End every time
  we've been to London. Mother used to get absolutely furious, but there it
  was. There was no moving him. He's like a little Tzar there. I think they
  even consult him before they dismiss a servant. Well, of course I marched in
  there when I arrived this morning. 'No, Sir Matthew wasn't staying
  there&mdash;certainly hadn't slept there last night. They hadn't seen him for
  days.' Now, what in the name of all that's amazing, Charles, can have induced
  him, after thirty years of persecution from his women-kind, to voluntarily
  change his hotel?"</p>

  <p>"Queer thing," Dutley acquiesced. "Have you rung up the London
  office?"</p>

  <p>"I have. I rang them up when I rang you. He hasn't been there, and they
  weren't expecting him."</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt whatever," Dutley declared, as he moved a little closer
  to her side, "that life just now has taken on a complex and mysterious turn.
  It is a most providential thing that our supplies gave out and that I did not
  stay any longer in Abyssinia."</p>

  <p>"You dear man, what difference are you going to make?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He was silent for a moment. She had a vague idea that she had hurt him.
  When he replied, however, his manner was just as usual.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm here to share the racket, anyway," he said simply. "Where are
  you staying then, Grace?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I went to Smiths,&mdash;very dull and very respectable, but the best
  place for me alone. I have a little bed-room and sitting room, look as though
  they came out of a doll's house. Charles, you're not on the committee of
  management of the Works, are you&mdash;not even as an honorary member?"</p>

  <p>"Not likely," he replied. "They meet every week. I shouldn't be any good
  there."</p>

  <p>"Well, do you know what I heard in the train coming up? Every one in the
  carriage was talking about it. They're discharging two thousand hands on
  Saturday and the rumour is that they're going to discharge another two
  thousand on Saturday week. The new factory's going to be closed down
  altogether. They're doubling their output of some sort of yarn and making
  scarcely any of the regular goods."</p>

  <p>Grace saw suddenly a new expression in Dutley's face. It came and went in
  a second. It left behind a smouldering anger.</p>

  <p>"I think your father should have told me before he took a step like that,"
  he said. "However, it can't be helped. He knows best, I suppose. Let's go in
  to lunch."</p>

  <p>They rose to their feet. In the doorway, they met face to face a trio of
  newcomers on their way to the cocktail lounge. There was a moment of
  constraint. Lucille, with a sprig of tuberoses pinned in her smart black
  jacket, took charge of affairs. The Baron de Brest was upon one side, and
  Ronnie on the other.</p>

  <p>"Grace, how too bad of you not to let us know that you were coming to
  town," she complained. "Good morning, Charles. Are we on speaking terms, or
  aren't we? You never came in to wish me good night."</p>

  <p>"I received a pretty plain hint not to," Dutley replied. "Besides, I think
  you had gone upstairs when I left."</p>

  <p>"You took the governor too seriously," Ronnie intervened. "He can't bear
  any one to stand up to him like that, and you must admit that you are being
  awkward, you know, Charles. You should spend an hour with us at the office,
  and you'd know how awkward. Boothroyds were sixty-seven when I left."</p>

  <p>"They'll be lower still to-morrow," Dutley observed. "Miss Parkinson tells
  me that the new factory is shutting down."</p>

  <p>The young man gave a little gasp. He and De Brest exchanged quick
  glances.</p>

  <p>"Is that authentic, Charles?" the former asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. It will be common property in a few hours' time."</p>

  <p>With scarcely a word of excuse, the young man rushed off to the telephone.
  Lucille introduced De Brest to Grace. There were a few moments' casual
  conversation.</p>

  <p>"You're lunching upstairs, I suppose?" Dutley remarked.</p>

  <p>Lucille nodded.</p>

  <p>"The Baron brought Ronnie up from the office to join our party," she
  explained.</p>

  <p>Charles passed his arm through Grace's.</p>

  <p>"I haven't had the pleasure of that call from you yet, Lord Dutley," De
  Brest ventured ingratiatingly.</p>

  <p>"I am thinking the matter over," Dutley assured him. "See you all
  later."</p>

  <p>A bowing <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> led the two to their table in
  the Grill Room.</p>

  <p>"Charles, whatever is wrong between you and Lucille?" Grace asked as they
  took their places.</p>

  <p>"Oh, we had a bit of a flare-up with the family last night," he replied.
  "Every one knows, of course, that there's something wrong at Boothroyds, and
  old Bessiter wants the exact particulars, but I'm not telling any one just
  yet. If we've got to smash, we've got to, but I don't like the idea of these
  gulls on the Stock Exchange making a fortune out of it, whilst our
  shareholders are losing their money."</p>

  <p>"But is it as bad as that?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty nearly, I should think, unless we get the formula back."</p>

  <p>"Is there no chance of that?"</p>

  <p>"Ask me in a week's time," he begged.</p>

  <p>They ordered lunch. Grace leaned forward.</p>

  <p>"Charles," she asked, "who is the Baron de Brest?"</p>

  <p>"A rotter," he answered. "Why?"</p>

  <p>She glanced around. They were at a corner table, and no one else was
  within hearing.</p>

  <p>"Because I feel sure I've seen him once before in Leeds," she said, "and
  he's exactly like the young man Father was talking to last night at the
  station."</p>

  <p>"Same fellow," Dutley admitted laconically, as he picked up the wine list
  "Don't let's spoil our lunch talking about him."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AT the astonishingly early hour of half-past nine in the
  morning, De Brest descended from his car, and rang the bell of Mr. Bessiter's
  house in Grosvenor Street.</p>

  <p>"If Miss Bessiter is not up, please do not disturb her," he told the
  servant who opened the door. "If she happens to be down I should like a word
  with her."</p>

  <p>Evidently De Brest had reckoned without the English breakfast. He was
  shown into the dining room, where Mr. Bessiter and Ronnie had just concluded
  their meal and Lucille was yawning in an easy-chair, with the <i>Morning
  Post</i> in her hand, and a cup of tea by her side. She looked at the visitor
  in frankly displayed amazement.</p>

  <p>"Been up all night?" she enquired.</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd," Mr. Bessiter admonished. "The Baron is a man of
  business. I bet, as a rule, he's about before any of us."</p>

  <p>"In Amsterdam," the young banker declared solemnly, "I am in my offices
  before eight o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Have some breakfast," Ronnie invited. "There's some fish and bacon on the
  sideboard&mdash;tea and coffee, too. Anything you fancy."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," the other refused. "I can rise early, but I cannot eat early.
  I came with just a little piece of news I thought might interest
  Mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>Lucille glanced up from her paper.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she asked languidly. "Nothing much interests me
  nowadays."</p>

  <p>"I called this morning, out of sheer kindness," De Brest went on, making
  his way as near as possible to Lucille, "to have a word with Lord Dutley. I
  had a proposition to put before him of a most advantageous nature. His house
  had the appearance of being partially dismantled. The door was opened by a
  black man. He informed me that Lord Dutley and his personal servant have
  departed on an expedition."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm damned!" Bessiter exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Just what he would do!" Ronnie muttered.</p>

  <p>Lucille laid down her newspaper.</p>

  <p>"Where is this expedition?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"The black man did not know. All that he was sure of was that it was not
  to Abyssinia or his master would have taken him."</p>

  <p>Ronnie turned to his sister.</p>

  <p>"You were talking to Charles yesterday at the Ritz, whilst I was on the
  telephone. Did he say anything about going away?"</p>

  <p>"Only vaguely. I think he said that London didn't seem to be any place for
  him, or something of that sort."</p>

  <p>"It is an easy way of facing trouble," De Brest sneered.</p>

  <p>"Look here," Lucille expostulated, sitting up, "you are all down upon poor
  Charles. Remember he's never pretended to have anything to do with the
  business. He's completely out of the show in a commercial crisis like this.
  He didn't run away during the war, did he?"</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. De Brest flushed a little.</p>

  <p>"It is to be remembered," he said stiffly, "that I was of a neutral
  country. It is only lately that I have become a naturalised Englishman."</p>

  <p>"I'm not criticising," Lucille assured him, "only I think you're all
  rather rough on poor Charles. He can do no good here. He never pretended to
  have any brains and he must be bored and worried to death with it all. Why
  shouldn't he clear out if he wants to? Father's angry with him and has
  practically forbidden him the house. Ronnie's furious with him because he
  won't tell him the little he does know about the business, and I suppose in a
  way I am angry with him too. Why shouldn't he go and do the only thing he
  loves doing?"</p>

  <p>"Personally," De Brest announced, "I welcome his departure. If he had
  remained here, I should have tried to have done him a good action. As he has
  gone, well&mdash;what does it matter? The loss is his own. I am the more
  emboldened to ask Miss Lucille if she will come and dine and do a theatre
  with me to-night."</p>

  <p>"I'm through with playing gooseberry," Ronnie warned them. "I'll pick you
  up somewhere later if you like."</p>

  <p>Lucille hesitated.</p>

  <p>"It's rather early in the day," she yawned, "to make these final
  arrangements. Something more interesting might turn up."</p>

  <p>"It will be my endeavour," De Brest said earnestly, "to make the evening
  so interesting for you that nothing more agreeable could arrive. I suggest
  the Berkeley Grill at eight o'clock. My aunt has a box at the Opera, but I
  think a musical comedy would be more amusing."</p>

  <p>"It's awfully good of you," Lucille acknowledged, a little more
  graciously. "Make it a quarter-past eight, if you don't mind. I have an
  unpunctual hairdresser."</p>

  <p>A servant announced the car. Mr. Bessiter rose to his feet and lit a
  cigar.</p>

  <p>"See you later, I expect, De Brest."</p>

  <p>The latter assented.</p>

  <p>"I shall probably be down in the City. How did my account close, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Very favourably for you," Ronnie told him. "Unless something happens to
  steady Boothroyds to-day, you're in at the present moment about sixty
  thousand."</p>

  <p>"What should happen?" De Brest demanded quickly. "We know now the truth.
  We know that they're shutting down the Works gradually. What could happen, I
  ask you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," Ronnie declared confidently. "The only thing that makes the
  'bears' kind of uneasy now and then is that the shares come on the market so
  slowly. You see, Dutley holds an enormous quantity, and I believe has kept
  his word&mdash;I don't think he's sold a single one of them."</p>

  <p>"It is very foolish of him," De Brest remarked severely. "He could have
  sold at eighty, seventy-nine, seventy-eight, and all the way down to
  sixty&mdash;shares, too, which have the appearance of becoming practically
  worthless."</p>

  <p>Mr. Bessiter grunted.</p>

  <p>"Dutley may be quixotic," he said, "but he isn't quite such an ass as he
  seems. He's hung on to his mother's fortune all right. I should say that he's
  a holder of some four hundred thousand pounds' worth of War Stock."</p>

  <p>De Brest stood perfectly motionless for a minute. There was a very
  unpleasant curve to his lips and a gleam in his eyes which might have been
  only of envy, but which certainly contained a suggestion of malice. Lucille,
  seeing, wondered whether she was really in love with him.</p>

  <p>"If I had only known that'" he muttered, half to himself.</p>

  <p>"What difference would it have made?" Lucille enquired curiously.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Only that coming down in the train the other night, he asked my advice
  about increasing his income. I thought he had only Boothroyd shares to sell,
  or a few other stray securities, and I'm afraid I wasn't very interested. I
  could have made his fortune."</p>

  <p>"Come on, Ronnie," Mr. Bessiter called to his son. "The car's waiting. We
  must get along and make ours. Still the same instructions, Baron?"</p>

  <p>"Still the same," De Brest acquiesced. "As markets stand, I suppose you
  don't need a margin?"</p>

  <p>"Your profit's margin enough," Ronnie rejoined. "See you later."</p>

  <p>De Brest lingered in the room for a minute or two after their departure.
  Lucille gave him no particular encouragement.</p>

  <p>"If you really want me to like you," she confided, "you mustn't come and
  see me at this hour of the morning. I don't like it. I only get up out of a
  misguided sense of duty, because I know that if I don't, Mother will. I
  haven't made up; I've scarcely had a bath. I'm still remembering last night's
  cigarettes and champagne. I don't want any of the ghosts of my sins about
  me."</p>

  <p>He laughed softly. Decidedly she was of a type which appealed to him.</p>

  <p>"I will go, Miss Lucille," he said. "All that I lingered for was just a
  kind word from you. You have seen what has become of this young man now that
  trouble is abroad. He does not stay to face it. He does nothing. You will
  remember?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I shall remember," she promised, as she waved him away. "A
  quarter-past eight at the Berkeley, unless, before then, I have a perfectly
  satisfactory explanation from Charles. I shall take a great deal of amusing
  and if I am not amused I shall come home. I'm in a quaint mood and I'm not in
  the least likely to be a gracious guest."</p>

  <p>"You are the only guest in the world whose company could bring me joy," De
  Brest, who had paid his shilling on the preceding afternoon to inspect the
  will of Lucille's grandmother, declared fervently.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ON the whole, the evening, starting at the Berkeley and
  finishing at the Embassy, was a success. They had met the Princess at the
  Opera. She had been very gracious to them both and presented Lucille to a
  minor royalty. The performance had been good and the crowd at the Embassy
  cheerful. Plans had been made for later in the week, and De Brest arrived at
  his very comfortable bachelor suite of rooms in the Milan lighter-hearted
  than he had been for weeks. On the threshold of the salon he came to an
  abrupt standstill. An unannounced visitor was seated in one of his
  easy-chairs. His heart sank as he recognised him.</p>

  <p>"Sir Matthew!" he exclaimed, and there was a marked lack of enthusiasm in
  his greeting. "No one told me that you were here."</p>

  <p>"They wouldn't know," Sir Matthew replied, keeping his hands in his
  trousers pockets and making no effort to rise. "I've taken rooms here for a
  night or two, on this same floor. I can't do any good down at Marlingthorpe.
  There are a few little matters I want to look into at this end."</p>

  <p>De Brest threw his overcoat on to the sofa and pushed the whisky and soda
  towards his guest, who shook his head grimly.</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't come here to drink with you, lad," he said. "I came to have
  a few plain words, and maybe the sooner they're spoken the better."</p>

  <p>De Brest ensconced himself in the other easy-chair.</p>

  <p>"I wish that you had let me know you were coming," he regretted. "I would
  have put off my engagement and been here to meet you. You did not say
  anything about it when you saw me off at Leeds."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know then. I went in to the Club that night and I heard a bit of
  news there that I've got to find out the truth about. I was told that
  Glenaltons have invited tenders for the erection of a new factory within a
  few miles of Manchester, to cover forty acres of ground. Furthermore, that
  their agents in Belgium and Germany were looking at machinery. For what
  purpose do you think, eh?"</p>

  <p>De Brest had the air of a man preparing for conflict. He was obviously,
  however, far from being at his ease.</p>

  <p>"How should I know?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I hope, for your own sake, you don't. Still, this is the Club gossip.
  They say that it's for the manufacture of artificial silks&mdash;Glenaltons,
  mind you, who've been toying with the idea for years, but never yet made a
  proper start. Now, harken to me, young fellow, and I'll tell you a
  story."</p>

  <p>De Brest leaned from his place and mixed himself a strong drink. Blast all
  this gossip! He had thought himself safe for at least a week.</p>

  <p>"Thirty years ago, Robert Glenalton, John Boothroyd&mdash;young Charles
  Dutley's father&mdash;and I met at the Cannon Street Hotel here in London.
  We'd made our first basketful of that rayon stuff&mdash;as they call it
  nowadays&mdash;and we had it there with us. John&mdash;young Dutley's
  dad&mdash;he was scared of the business. We were doing pretty well on our own
  manufactures, and it meant raising a sum of money we'd think nothing of
  nowadays, but which was like a fairy story then. He proposed to Glenalton an
  amalgamation of the two firms. Our capitals were about equal. We were each
  making brass as fast as we could, and the thing seemed like a square deal.
  Now I won't say who was right or who was wrong. John Boothroyd wasn't
  anything like this young gadabout son of his. He was always a hard man and
  one for having his own way. Glenalton was as pig-headed a manufacturer as
  ever darkened the portals of the Manchester Cotton Exchange. There wasn't a
  great deal between them as I remember it, but neither would give way. They
  parted in a temper, and Glenalton's last words I've never forgotten to this
  minute.</p>

  <p>"'You think you're damned clever,' he said to old John, who was my
  governor in those days, 'because your chemist has hit upon the secret of
  making that stuff, and because you've got it, you think you can dictate to
  Bob Glenalton. Well, you damn well can't, and that's all there is about it.
  There are plenty of other chemists in the world. Before five years are gone,
  I'll be making that stuff as well as you. And then look out, John, my
  lad!'</p>

  <p>"With that they parted."</p>

  <p>"This is a very intriguing story," De Brest commented, with every
  appearance of interest. "It is all quite new to me, too."</p>

  <p>"There aren't so many that know it," Sir Matthew acknowledged. "Well, old
  John Boothroyd came out on top. Bob Glenalton tried all he could. He had
  chemists from all over the world, but he never struck it right. He kept the
  whole business as quiet as he could. Everything was done in a factory outside
  the main Works, but bits of news were always leaking out, and to the day of
  his death you couldn't make old John Boothroyd&mdash;Lord Dutley he was by
  then&mdash;happier than by talking of Glenalton fiddling about with his
  experiments. They went ahead all right in other ways&mdash;made almost as
  much brass as we did&mdash;but the old man never kept his word. He never
  found out how to make that art silk, and, by God, my lad," Sir Matthew
  concluded, slowly rising to his feet and growing taller until his head seemed
  almost to touch the ceiling, "they're never going to with our formula."</p>

  <p>De Brest took a cigar from an open box on the mantelpiece, bit off the end
  savagely, and thrust it into the corner of his mouth.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to hear this, Sir Matthew," he said.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>The Baron looked around the small room suspiciously. Even though any
  manner of eavesdropping was plainly impossible, he lowered his voice.</p>

  <p>"The gossip you heard was probably true," he confided. "If we can arrange
  the transference safely&mdash;and that, I think, is a certainty&mdash;I have
  sold the formula to Glenaltons for a million pounds."</p>

  <p>"Then you can damn well unsell it," Sir Matthew declared fiercely, "for
  they'll never get it. Listen, you," he went on, pausing for a moment to dab
  his forehead with his lavender-perfumed handkerchief. "Sooner than let that
  formula go to Glenaltons, I'd give the whole show away. I'd spend the rest of
  my life in prison, but there would be one or two of you who'd hang for that
  night's business."</p>

  <p>There was a soft tapping at the door&mdash;nothing insistent; there was
  even a suggestion of timidity about the summons. The two men, who had been
  glaring at one another, were speechless for a few seconds.</p>

  <p>"Who's there at this time of the night?" Sir Matthew demanded.</p>

  <p>De Brest shook his head. Even as he rose unsteadily to his feet, the door
  was thrust open, and Doctor Hisedale stood upon the threshold.</p>

  <p>"They told me that you had been asking for me downstairs, De Brest," he
  explained. "I have been late at the laboratory to-night&mdash;a very
  interesting new diffusion. It is Sir Matthew Parkinson, I believe. You have
  not forgotten me, Sir Matthew?"</p>

  <p>"Not likely," the other growled. "We're kind of partners in this murderous
  business, aren't we?"</p>

  <p>The Baron shut the door quickly. Doctor Hisedale raised his hands in
  shocked fashion.</p>

  <p>"My dear Sir Matthew!" he expostulated. "You should not talk like that. We
  were partners in a very daring enterprise, during which, unfortunately,
  incidents occurred, which I think had better be forgotten."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew smiled. It was a broad smile which had its peculiarities. It
  was benevolent on one side of his mouth and evil on the other, according to
  the twist of his lips. The two men who watched it were neither of them at all
  comfortable.</p>

  <p>"If I were in your shoes," he declared, "I, too, should want those
  incidents forgotten, but I'm not, you see. I've been all sorts of a damned
  fool since I knew this young fellow here, but that was one mistake I didn't
  make. I was safely in my bed at the Midland Hotel whilst you others were
  qualifying for the gallows."</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, Sir Matthew!" De Brest exclaimed in a frenzy.</p>

  <p>"My dear, good friend!" Doctor Hisedale remonstrated. "Drop your voice, if
  you please. Keep silent. Those are terrible things which you say."</p>

  <p>"Well, maybe I'll be silent and maybe I won't," Sir Matthew rejoined,
  after a brief pause, "but understand this once and for all, young De Brest.
  Our formula isn't going to Glenaltons, and that's that."</p>

  <p>Doctor Hisedale looked enquiringly at his fellow conspirator, who nodded
  back in response.</p>

  <p>"Sir Matthew has been hearing some gossip about Glenaltons inviting plans
  for a new factory," he confided. "It seems that they are old commercial
  enemies, and Sir Matthew objects to our dealing with them for the
  formula."</p>

  <p>"They damned well aren't going to have it," Sir Matthew repeated.</p>

  <p>Doctor Hisedale remained pink and white and unruffled. He drew a chair up
  to the table, and ran his hands over his stiff, short hair.</p>

  <p>"Dear, dear me!" he sighed. "This is most unfortunate. I was looking
  forward to Sir Matthew's congratulations. Glenaltons' offer, if we are able
  to carry it through without risk, would have been a magnificent compensation
  for all our anxieties. Does Sir Matthew understand that the million pounds is
  to be paid in cash? There is no other firm in business, I believe, who could
  make such a proposition."</p>

  <p>"Consider for a moment, if you please, Sir Matthew," De Brest begged.
  "Your share of this million will be a hundred and seventy thousand pounds in
  bank notes roughly. You will be able to discharge your other liabilities, and
  call yourself once more a rich man."</p>

  <p>"I don't need you to tell me what I can do, young fellow," Sir Matthew
  growled, "and as for my other liabilities, the less you say about those the
  better. You know who's responsible for them. I say that Glenaltons are not
  going to have the formula. Put that in your pipes, and smoke it, both of
  you!"</p>

  <p>"Let us consider the situation reasonably," Doctor Hisedale proposed. "You
  will remember, Sir Matthew, that, besides yourself, myself and De Brest here,
  there are three others interested&mdash;Thomas Ryde, Huneybell, and Hartley
  Wright. There are six of us altogether. Five of us, Sir Matthew, have our
  eyes fixed upon that million. I only put this for your reflection. One has
  sometimes to look at matters from the point of view of the other person. To
  five of us out of six, the thought of that million is very good indeed."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew made no answer for several moments. There was, however, no
  sign of any weakening in his manner. Presently, he gravely patted the breast
  pocket of his coat.</p>

  <p>"The disposal of the formula was after all a wonderful idea," he said. "I
  have in my pocket-book here a scrap of paper which to the ordinary person
  would seem to be of no value at all. That scrap of paper will stop either of
  you, or any of you, from touching the formula against my will. I'll beg
  through the streets of Leeds before that scrap of paper finds its way back to
  Queen Victoria Street to release the formula for Glenaltons."</p>

  <p>This time the silence was almost tragical. De Brest, was a figure of
  despair. Doctor Hisedale was tapping lightly upon the table with his finger
  tips. He had the air of a man mildly puzzled, who was studying a chess board
  on which a pawn or at most a knight was in some temporary danger. Presently,
  he looked up, and it was a curious thing that his eyes met De Brest's
  travelling in the same direction. They were both looking towards the inside
  pocket of Sir Matthew's coat.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THE Yorkshireman took his leave a few minutes later abruptly
  and without cordiality. The two men listened to his heavy footsteps in the
  corridor and to the slamming of his door.</p>

  <p>"Nearly opposite," Doctor Hisedale reflected.</p>

  <p>De Brest had gone a little paler. He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I think," he muttered, "Thomas Ryde should deal with this."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MR. EDWARD WOLF was frankly panic-stricken. He had fled from
  the window of the little sitting room in Greenwall Avenue to a distant
  corner, and even there he had the air of a man who would have liked to crawl
  behind the easy-chair. Dutley, shabbily dressed, even, after ten days of
  absence from civilisation, unrecognisable, stood just out of sight of the
  street, between the curtains. On the other side of the way, a prim little
  figure of a man, carrying a small black bag and holding an umbrella over his
  head, was walking briskly and purposefully towards the last house in the
  thoroughfare&mdash;a hideous, stuccoed-looking affair, with a tower on each
  side.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's our friend," Dutley murmured, half to himself. "That's our
  friend right enough. Looks like a churchwarden, doesn't he?"</p>

  <p>"He's a blooming murderer&mdash;that's what he is," Wolf whined from his
  distant corner. "You let him alone, Guv'nor. You don't get me near
  him&mdash;I tell you straight."</p>

  <p>Mr. Thomas Ryde opened the front gate of his flamboyant,
  unpropitious-looking residence. He paused to furl his umbrella, scraped his
  boots carefully, and, inserting a latchkey in the front door, entered the
  house and disappeared. Wolf came out from his lurking place.</p>

  <p>"You've got a blooming nerve, Guv'nor," he said, "to be hanging round
  here, opposite to him. You may think you're well disguised&mdash;you took me
  in all right&mdash;but if he's ever seen you before you'd never deceive him
  for a single moment. You sent for me, and I came, but I tell you straight the
  air of 'ighgate's 'ealthy enough, no doubt, for them as lives here and minds
  their own business, but it's no good to me and it won't be to you if he
  catches sight of you."</p>

  <p>"You're rather depressing," Dutley observed. "I rather thought of calling
  on Mr. Thomas Ryde."</p>

  <p>"Then you're as big a fool as you look, which I have sometimes mistrusted,
  and that's all there is to be said about it," Mr. Wolf declared vigorously.
  "What do you want from me, Guv'nor? You sent for me and I've come. I told you
  before I wasn't going to touch your job."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," Dutley assented. "Well, in any case, I wasn't asking you to do
  anything about our friend over there. A perfect paragon, he seems to be!
  Half-past eight bus from the corner every morning. Half-past nine in his
  office. An hour giving instructions to his town traveller. Out to pay a few
  calls, quite in the regular way of business. Luncheon at a very pleasant
  little city club. Back to the office to receive his reports from his
  traveller. A few more calls and home to tea. An exemplary life, Mr. Wolf. No
  low tastes for cinemas, or saloon bars, or anything of that sort.
  Books&mdash;heaps of them. A strong reading lamp and early to bed."</p>

  <p>"Did you find out all this yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I did. I spent the best part of a week studying Mr. Thomas Ryde."</p>

  <p>"Well, you've got more nerve than I have!"</p>

  <p>"There's only one thing that puzzles me just a little still," Dutley went
  on. "A curious taste in lamp shades our friend seems to have! He sits with
  his curtains drawn back&mdash;quite a reasonable thing to do when one
  considers that he has all London below to look at&mdash;but why, I ask you,
  Mr. Wolf, does he continually change the colour of his lamp shades? Red one
  night, green another, occasionally even purple. If I could solve that little
  puzzle, I should know all that I wanted to about Mr. Thomas Ryde."</p>

  <p>"Well, you find out, Guv'nor," Edward Wolf suggested. "I ain't a-going
  over there to ring the bell and start a friendly chat, even about lamp
  shades. If there's nothing more you've got to say to me," he added, picking
  up his cap, "I'd like you to pay my expenses for coming up here, and I'll be
  getting along."</p>

  <p>"Don't be an ass, Wolf," Dutley admonished. "You know I didn't send for
  you to come up here to make a fool of you. You're going to earn a hundred
  pounds. Sit down in that chair and listen to me. We've finished with Thomas
  Ryde."</p>

  <p>"A hundred quid!" Edward Wolf muttered. "Get at it, Guv'nor!"</p>

  <p>"Last time I had the pleasure of receiving a visit from you," Dutley
  continued, "you heard me mention the name of a foreign nobleman&mdash;the
  Baron de Brest. You showed signs of familiarity with the name. I believe you
  even went so far as to warn me against him. Why did you?"</p>

  <p>"He ain't on the square, Guv'nor, that's all. I'm not saying he's
  dangerous&mdash;he's too chicken-'earted&mdash;but I can tell you this: he
  don't mind doing dirty work through a thug now and then."</p>

  <p>"Meaning?"</p>

  <p>"Well, if he wants a job done, he don't do it himself. Bill Meakin was
  copped doing one for him. He paid up all right, lawyer and all, 'andsome. But
  a cove who uses a thug needs a bit of watching and that's why I tipped you
  the office."</p>

  <p>"I see," Dutley murmured. "I'm keeping my eye on that gentleman already.
  Listen, Wolf. You know him if you see him?"</p>

  <p>"That's right, Guv'nor."</p>

  <p>"You're not afraid of him as you are of the little gentleman
  opposite?"</p>

  <p>"No, I ain't afeared of him. He's a big, lousy sort of fellow. Keep out of
  any scrap if he could."</p>

  <p>"Well, a few days ago," Dutley recounted, "he called at my house in Curzon
  Street, knowing full well that I wasn't there, and asked permission to go
  into my study and leave a note for me. My servant wasn't having any, but he
  could scarcely get rid of the fellow. In the end, he offered him a tenner to
  let him sit in my study and just write one note."</p>

  <p>"What did he want to pinch?" Mr. Wolf enquired shrewdly.</p>

  <p>"That's what I should like to know," Dutley confided. "Now, you can earn
  your hundred pounds this way. You watch my house from the time the servants
  go to bed&mdash;say eleven o'clock&mdash;until five. If you see any signs of
  De Brest or any of his thugs hanging around, there's an all-night telephone
  at the pub at the corner of Clarges Street. You telephone here&mdash;178
  Mount View&mdash;and if you can't get me, and they try any house-breaking,
  just pass word on to the police and fade away. You get a hundred pounds
  anyway, and another hundred if you have any luck. Is it good enough?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Edward Wolf grinned.</p>

  <p>"It's my job," he declared. "The little 'un opposite ain't in it, is he?"
  he added anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Not a chance," Dutley replied. "This, I rather think, is a private show
  between De Brest and myself."</p>

  <p>"Start to-night, eh?"</p>

  <p>Dutley nodded, counted out a bulky package of notes, and handed them
  over.</p>

  <p>"Come up here," he directed, "if you have anything to tell me. If I'm not
  in, wait."</p>

  <p>"Crikey, what's that?" Wolf exclaimed suddenly, shrinking back to his far
  corner of the room.</p>

  <p>Dutley glanced across the way. From behind the bare, uncurtained window of
  the Towers, a strangely coloured, purple light was showing. Wolf caught up
  his cap.</p>

  <p>"You can get out the back way," Dutley told him.</p>

  <p>The little man stealthily withdrew, opened the back door, hurried down the
  narrow strip of garden, opened another rough wooden door, and slunk along a
  cobbled passage towards safety. In the sitting room, Dutley, having carefully
  extinguished his own lights, sat at the window, and watched&mdash;.</p>

  <p>Five minutes passed&mdash;ten&mdash;quarter of an hour. Several taxis went
  honking by. A limousine with flaming lamps followed in their wake. There were
  a few pedestrians, one or two couples arm in arm, regardless of the weather,
  making for the borders of the heath. Then silence seemed to settle down upon
  Greenwall Avenue. The strangely shaded lamp still burned from behind the
  uncurtained window, and once Dutley fancied that he saw the figure of a man
  pass between it and the casement. Otherwise, inertia appeared to have
  descended upon the neighbourhood. Dutley, however, with a smile at the
  corners of his lips, was apparently satisfied with his vigil. Presently he
  pulled the curtains, turned on the light, mixed himself a whisky and soda,
  and took up the evening paper. He had scarcely commenced its perusal before
  he stiffened into an attitude of listening. There was the sound of the soft
  turning of a key in a door from the far end of the passage, a footstep
  approaching. Dutley's hand slipped into his pocket. He turned out the light
  and changed his position. A moment later, the revolver was back in its place,
  and the light once more switched on. Burdett lingered for a moment upon the
  threshold whilst he disposed of his dripping mackintosh and afterwards
  entered the room. Although his clothes were outrageously shabby and his chin
  for nearly a fortnight unshaven, his voice was still that of the perfect
  servant.</p>

  <p>"Your idea was quite correct, my lord," he confided.</p>

  <p>"Good! And don't forget to drop that 'my lord'," Dutley enjoined. "You'll
  slip into it when we're not alone."</p>

  <p>Burdett sighed. Almost the hardest part of his task these days was to
  remember that in Highgate new identities existed as well as a new manner of
  life. He began his report.</p>

  <p>"There was a taxicab waiting round the corner of John Street, another one
  only a dozen yards further back, and a limousine on the other side of the
  way. The chauffeur was pretending to tinker with his engine. As soon as the
  purple light shone out of the window, you could see quite plainly that that
  was what they had been waiting for. The two taxicabs started off first and
  the limousine afterwards. Another taxicab must have been parked under the
  trees the other side of the road, because that went off the other way. The
  two that passed the Towers and the limousine honked as they went by."</p>

  <p>"I noticed that," Dutley remarked. "I suppose you couldn't catch a glimpse
  of any of the passengers?"</p>

  <p>"The drivers didn't give me a chance, sir," Burdett regretted. "It's
  pretty clear, though, that that purple light was what they were waiting for.
  As soon as they saw it, off they went."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and didn't stop at the Towers," Dutley meditated. "On Wednesday,
  when the red light was out, three taxis stopped there, within five minutes.
  What do you deduce from that, Burdett?"</p>

  <p>"I should say the purple light was meant to warn 'em off."</p>

  <p>"My own idea entirely," Dutley agreed. "The purple light means
  danger&mdash;'Don't come near.' But what danger? What is our friend over
  there afraid of? Does he know that he is being watched? You don't think
  anybody over there saw you?"</p>

  <p>Burdett indulged in a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, but I'm afraid that the gentlemen we're watching did."</p>

  <p>"The devil!" Dutley exclaimed. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he's got a big telescope in one of them towers there, sir, and in
  the other one he's got a searchlight. It just flashed down the road once and
  I'm afraid it got me. Five minutes afterwards that purple light was
  going."</p>

  <p>"Damn the fellow! You went out by the back way, didn't you, Burdett, and
  down the lane?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly did, sir. No one could have seen me leave the house, or seen
  anything of me at all until I turned into the avenue. I stood under the trees
  out of the rain and I even made myself believe that I was waiting for an
  omnibus. I just felt that wave of light for a few seconds, and that's
  all."</p>

  <p>"Damned annoying!" Dutley pondered. "We were getting on so well. I've got
  four of them. I only want the fifth. What the devil did you go and get in the
  way of that thing for, Burdett?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't help it," the man regretted. "I was underneath the thickest
  trees in the avenue, and with another thick tree between me and the next
  electric standard. There wasn't such another place. I'd got my electric torch
  all ready in my pocket. I was just coming up to pretend that I hoped the
  taxi-driver was disengaged, and there it was bang on me. Sent me spinning
  round. That wasn't any astronomer's pretty toy, sir; it was a wicked
  searchlight, meant to discover anything wherever it lit, even to the pebbles
  on the way. I don't know who he may be, sir, that chap up at the Towers,
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then Dutley suddenly stiffened once more. The outside gate was cautiously
  opened, creaking slightly on its hinges. There were footsteps upon the few
  yards of tiled walk which led to the front door&mdash;quiet footsteps, yet
  hurrying as they approached. Dutley listened without blenching. The newcomer
  was obviously a stranger, for he failed to find the bell. A moment later
  there was an indistinct but perfectly audible tapping upon the panels of the
  front door.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">INTO Dutley's eyes came the pleased light of impending
  battle. Nevertheless, he felt a little puzzled. Even sounds have their
  psychology, and the feeble, almost timorous rapping upon the door seemed to
  carry with it a suggestion of nervousness behind, something far removed from
  the trim, brisk personality of Mr. Thomas Ryde. Burdett looked at him
  enquiringly.</p>

  <p>"I'll open the door myself," Dutley said. "You can cover me from the side
  window."</p>

  <p>Then for once Burdett was able to forget that he was the servant.</p>

  <p>"No, you don't," he answered, pushing his way past his master into the
  passage. "No one's got anything on me. It's you they want, if they want any
  one. You do the covering, my lord, and I'll open the door."</p>

  <p>Dutley had no time to argue, barely time to step to the window. He caught
  a hurried glimpse of a weedy-looking individual almost tumbling into the
  house, and he slipped his gun back into its hiding place. A moment later, the
  mackintoshed figure of Mr. Huneybell staggered into the room, closely
  followed by Burdett.</p>

  <p>"Too frightened to speak a word he is," the latter announced scornfully.
  "Doesn't even know whom he wants."</p>

  <p>Mr. Huneybell was either recovering, or his state had not been so abject
  as it appeared. Regardless of the niceties of his position as a guest, he
  laid his dripping umbrella upon the carpet. His hat followed suit. His voice,
  it was true, shook a little, but once started he found no difficulty with his
  words.</p>

  <p>"What are you both, you two?" he asked. "What are you watching the Towers
  for? Are you after any one there?"</p>

  <p>"Come, that's quite a great many questions," Dutley observed. "What am I
  to gain by answering them?"</p>

  <p>"Your life most likely," Mr. Huneybell answered quickly. "You don't happen
  to have," he added, glancing round the room wistfully, "a drop of whisky or
  brandy, or anything?"</p>

  <p>"Whisky and soda for our visitor," Dutley ordered. "Why not take your
  mackintosh off? I don't know whether I shall answer your questions or not,
  but there's no harm in being comfortable about it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Huneybell made no direct reply. His eyes were watching Burdett prepare
  his drink. Almost before the soda water was splashed into the tumbler, he
  snatched it away and drank half its contents. Then he set it down with a sigh
  of relief and removed his mackintosh. His long, skinny fingers travelled
  through his mass of black hair, without materially improving its tousled
  condition. He gazed at the little stream of water flowing from his umbrella
  across the carpet.</p>

  <p>"Afraid I'm messing your room up," he apologised. "Sorry, but I'm
  scared."</p>

  <p>"You're the second frightened man who's been here this evening," Dutley
  remarked, with a smile. "We'll take care of you, Mr.
  whatever-your-name-is."</p>

  <p>Mr. Huneybell was not a pleasant sight. He had lost weight during the last
  few weeks, and some form of skin disease had brought red blotches here and
  there into the white unhealthiness of his cheeks. The unwholesome
  perspiration of fear still oozed from his forehead. Burdett refilled his
  glass, and he sank into a chair. The sound of passing footsteps, however,
  brought him to his feet with a little cry of terror.</p>

  <p>"Look here, my friend," Dutley told him, "you're safe from whatever you're
  afraid of in here. My friend and I are both armed, and there's a Colt's
  revolver in that drawer if you'd like it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Huneybell was somewhat reassured.</p>

  <p>"You are detectives then?" he asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly. We are looking after a little matter on our own
  account&mdash;nothing to do with the police."</p>

  <p>"You're watching the Towers?"</p>

  <p>"Come, come!" Dutley expostulated. "You're the visitor. You came to us,
  you know. You had a reason, I suppose. You talk first."</p>

  <p>The whisky was beginning to have its effect. Mr. Huneybell was calmer.</p>

  <p>"If you were in my place," he said, "watched all the time by the devil
  incarnate, you'd be nervous."</p>

  <p>"The devil incarnate being, I presume, Mr. Thomas Ryde?"</p>

  <p>Huneybell leaned forward in his chair. He took off his spectacles,
  momentarily revealing eyes of surprising brightness.</p>

  <p>"Is it Thomas Ryde you're after?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"You're determined to make us talk first," Dutley complained
  good-humouredly. "All right. I don't know that I mind much. He is the bright
  little lad we are wondering about."</p>

  <p>Huneybell shivered.</p>

  <p>"It scares me to hear any one talk about him like that," he confessed.
  "You say you're all armed. You may know something about your weapons, or you
  may not, but I tell you this, I'll lay odds, if he knew we three were here
  and talking as we are doing, he'd put us all three to sleep."</p>

  <p>"He seems quite a desperate fellow," Dutley remarked.</p>

  <p>"Whoever you may be, sir," Huneybell continued earnestly, "don't you talk
  or think of him as though he were an ordinary person, because he isn't. I've
  heard the history of most of the great criminals, and there was always some
  time in their lives that they softened a bit, always one little thing in
  their character which prevented their being absolutely stony-hearted
  butchers. Thomas Ryde hasn't got that little bit. I know, because I've worked
  with him and been with him for the last four or five years."</p>

  <p>There was a flash in Dutley's eyes. His forefinger shot out.</p>

  <p>"You're his town traveller, Huneybell," he exclaimed. "You're one of the
  five. You were in the Marlingthorpe burglary."</p>

  <p>Mr. Huneybell did not appear so disconcerted as might have been
  expected.</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose I should have told you sooner or later," he said. "Now
  let me tell you this and it's God's truth. I've saved both your lives
  to-night. It was you," he added, turning to Burdett, "who were watching under
  the trees. I saw you. I recognized you, too. It was I who worked the
  searchlight from the tower. Lucky for you, let me tell you, that it was I and
  not he who saw you. I shot the searchlight off quick, as soon as I was sure.
  He's the devil incarnate, that man. There hadn't been a soul hanging about
  for half an hour&mdash;no signs of any one suspicious&mdash;everything was
  ready for his friends&mdash;when up he comes to the tower.</p>

  <p>"'Andrew,' he said, pointing out of the window, down the avenue, 'that's
  where a sensible man would stand who wanted to watch this front
  gate&mdash;especially a night like this. Get your searchlight on him. If
  there's any one standing still there, stamp on the floor three times.'</p>

  <p>"With that he left me. Sure enough, you were there. I stamped on the floor
  three times, and on went the purple lamp. Not a soul entered the place. Then
  he came up to me. You never can tell whether he is interested or not. There's
  no more expression upon his face than on a stone image. There's just one
  thing he does, though, sometimes, and he was doing it then&mdash;moistening
  his lips with the tip of his tongue.</p>

  <p>"'Andrew,' he said, 'there was some one there.'</p>

  <p>"'A man watching,' I told him. 'No doubt about that.'</p>

  <p>"'Did you recognise him?' he asked.</p>

  <p>"'I never saw him before in my life,' I answered.</p>

  <p>"'You're sure he wasn't, for instance, one of those two young men who have
  taken rooms in the house opposite?'</p>

  <p>"'Dead sure,' I answered. 'He was a head taller than either of them.'</p>

  <p>"'What became of him?' he wanted to know.</p>

  <p>"'He went off down the avenue,' I told him.</p>

  <p>"There wasn't a sign of it in his face, but I knew then that he was
  troubled.</p>

  <p>"'I don't like strangers watching us, Andrew,' he admitted. 'If it had
  been one of those two young men we could have dealt with them. A stranger
  watching is perplexing.'</p>

  <p>"With that he went downstairs."</p>

  <p>"Why," Dutley asked, "did you deny the fact that the man who was watching
  was my young friend here?"</p>

  <p>Huneybell answered without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Because your young friend," he said, "would have been a dead man before
  to-morrow, and you, too, most likely."</p>

  <p>"And you decided then to save our lives, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I never meant to be mixed up in any killing," Huneybell declared, almost
  passionately. "I've seen two men shot&mdash;that's enough for me. That's what
  made me screw up my courage to come here."</p>

  <p>Dutley rose, filled a pipe, and pushed the whisky bottle and syphon of
  soda water towards his visitor.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "let us consider that we've got through the
  preliminaries. You have told us, or allowed us to guess, a good deal, Mr.
  Huneybell. Help yourself to another drink, and I will return the
  compliment."</p>

  <p>Huneybell was almost apologetic as he accepted the invitation.</p>

  <p>"I never used to drink," he confided. "It got hold of me the night after I
  got back to London from Yorkshire. Another man who was in it and I, we sat in
  a dirty little cook shop near St. Pancras. If I hadn't drunk I should have
  died with fear. The taste for it's been with me ever since."</p>

  <p>"Drink's a very good thing in its place," Dutley said, "but let's see if
  we can't help you to get rid of that fear. That will do you more good than
  all the whisky in the world. Tell us exactly what made you cross the road
  from the Towers and come here?"</p>

  <p>Huneybell smiled&mdash;an acid, frightened smile.</p>

  <p>"I didn't cross the road from the Towers," he replied. "I wasn't quite
  such a fool as that. I walked to Bull End Corner, where the buses stop, and
  came back the other side of the way."</p>

  <p>"What made you come at all then?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I thought if you were detectives, it would be all up with us
  anyway, and if you weren't there was a chance I might make a deal with
  you."</p>

  <p>"What sort of a deal?"</p>

  <p>Huneybell was well away now. He was almost fluent.</p>

  <p>"You knew what the object of the Marlingthorpe burglary was, I suppose?"
  he went on. "We stole the Blunn formula&mdash;the formula Boothroyds have
  been making those silks on all these years. There hasn't been anything about
  it in the papers, but we've got the formula. We stole it and we've got it,
  and Boothroyds aren't making their silk any more. My idea was, if you were
  not detectives, you were out after the formula."</p>

  <p>"And you're not so very wrong either," Dutley encouraged. "Where is
  it?"</p>

  <p>"It's in a Safe Deposit Company here in London. The receipt is in six
  pieces. Each one of us who were in the show has one. The formula can't be
  withdrawn unless all six pieces are produced."</p>

  <p>"Trusting band of brothers, aren't you?" Dutley observed, with a
  smile.</p>

  <p>"My share of the receipt," Huneybell announced deliberately, "is for
  sale."</p>

  <p>Dutley smoked reflectively for a time.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't seem to me that your piece is very much good without the
  others," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"It isn't worth much, perhaps, but it's worth something," Huneybell
  protested. "Mind, they can't get the formula without it. What I'd like is
  this. I want to get away&mdash;I want to get a long way away. They're
  starting a factory in Rio, where they'd give me a job if I could reach it.
  I've no children&mdash;only the wife to take with me. The formula's under
  offer at the present moment for a million pounds. My share ought to be worth
  at least a hundred and fifty thousand pounds. I'd take a couple of thousand
  down, and half anything else that comes, to be quit of it all and out of the
  country. That's what I've come to&mdash;stark, mortal funk. It's in my blood.
  I can't sleep, I can't work. I drink to forget."</p>

  <p>With a timid gesture, he drew the bottle towards him. Dutley watched him
  thoughtfully whilst he filled his glass.</p>

  <p>"I don't see what use your sixth share is to me," Dutley meditated. "That
  is to say," he went on, a moment later, "unless I know the names of the other
  five."</p>

  <p>"The names of the other five go with the money," Huneybell promised.</p>

  <p>"It's a deal, then," Dutley agreed. "I'll give you four hundred pounds
  now, on account, and the sixteen hundred pounds anywhere you like to meet me
  in the West End or in the City to-morrow."</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet and unlocked the drawer of a desk. Huneybell sat
  mopping his forehead. There was a great relief in his face.</p>

  <p>"I'm throwing away a fortune," he groaned, "but Gawd, the agony I've been
  through!"</p>

  <p>Dutley counted out the notes.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me the names of the other five," he enjoined. "You can trust me
  for the sixteen hundred. They're yours any time after the Bank opens
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Huneybell looked at him critically.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I expect I can trust you," he decided. "I'll tell you the names. Sir
  Matthew Parkinson, the Managing Director of Boothroyds, is one of them."</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the revelations of the last few weeks, the actual
  disclosure of the truth was a shock to Dutley.</p>

  <p>"Sir Matthew!" he repeated. "But why? It was his own business. He had a
  big holding in it. Why should he rob himself?"</p>

  <p>"Why did I make such a damned fool of myself?" Huneybell demanded
  bitterly. "I was making a certain five hundred a year honestly. Sir Matthew
  came into it, I think, because he was mixed up with a young man to whom he
  owed money, and who forced him to. He wasn't there at the burglary. What he
  did was to make sure that the formula was in that particular safe, and to
  make it easy for them to get impressions of the keys for opening up the
  offices."</p>

  <p>"Thank God he wasn't in the burglary," Dutley muttered. "What was the name
  of the young man?"</p>

  <p>"De Brest. He's a Dutchman, I believe."</p>

  <p>Dutley smiled happily.</p>

  <p>"That's good news."</p>

  <p>"Then Doctor Hisedale is another, and an American, Hartley Wright."</p>

  <p>"And who shot poor Rentoul?"</p>

  <p>"You needn't ask, I should think," Huneybell shivered. "Thomas Ryde did.
  Shot the watchman too. Now, I've come to the end of it. I've nothing more to
  tell you. Where can I have my sixteen hundred pounds? In the West End?"</p>

  <p>"At one o'clock to-morrow afternoon&mdash;at 34b Curzon Street," Dutley
  told him, scribbling the address on the back of a card. "And you'll bring
  with you your scrap of the receipt."</p>

  <p>"You'd scarcely be likely to part with the money if I didn't, would you?
  Yes, I'll bring it all right. Whom do I ask for at this address?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Burdett," Dutley told him. "He'll be there waiting for you."</p>

  <p>Huneybell rose to his feet. He drew the curtain a couple of inches apart,
  and looked across at the dark outline of the Towers. There was white terror
  in his face, an uncanny, more than bodily terror, in his staring eyes.</p>

  <p>"Finished with Highgate anyhow," he muttered. "Thank God!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE moment had come&mdash;the moment for which Huneybell had
  been praying all the morning. He pushed back the swing door of the warehouse
  and with his bag in his hand, made his way into the office. Mr. Ryde was
  seated there with a ledger before him. He looked up at his traveller's
  entrance.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he invited, leaning back in his chair. "A slack morning here.
  Any luck with you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not," was the regretful reply. "Grayson was out. I thought he
  might have bought those two last cases from the mills. Nobody else seemed in
  a buying humour."</p>

  <p>"What about my special offer to Ames Brothers?"</p>

  <p>"They wouldn't look at it, sir. They bought over a thousand pounds' worth
  of waste from the Continent last week."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde leaned back in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Bad luck," he said softly. "We need a few sales, Huneybell. I had a
  telephone message from Leeds this morning. They say there's a lot of stuff
  coming in. That reminds me. They want a report about those two cases that
  arrived yesterday afternoon. Where are they?"</p>

  <p>"In the warehouse, sir."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"There is no time like the present," he decided. "We will examine the
  cases together, Huneybell. Let me see, it was this afternoon I think you said
  you wished to visit your dentist. You asked for the afternoon off, I
  believe."</p>

  <p>Huneybell glanced desperately at the clock. His account of his morning
  calls had been entirely fictitious. He had spent the last two hours in the
  saloon bar of a public house not a quarter of a mile away, trying to gain
  courage for these few moments. He had a sudden illuminating vision of his
  folly. Why had he come back at all? It would have been as easy to slip off
  and wait somewhere in the West End. It was just routine which had brought
  him, the bondage of habit.</p>

  <p>"I wonder, sir," he proposed, as Mr. Thomas Ryde, always methodical, took
  off his neat black coat, and arrayed himself in a warehouse duster, "whether
  to-morrow morning would do for these cases? I don't think they are open yet.
  I thought I'd like to have a little lunch before I went to the dentist."</p>

  <p>"It will take us barely five minutes," his employer pointed out, "to
  glance at what they have sent us. I will not keep you longer. If you find
  yourself behind time, on this occasion I will permit you to charge a taxicab
  to the petty cash."</p>

  <p>Huneybell set down his bag, threw his overcoat and hat upon a counter,
  crossed the first warehouse side by side with his companion, and entered the
  second. Here he stopped short.</p>

  <p>"I don't see the cases, sir," he said, looking around.</p>

  <p>"Neither do I," Mr. Thomas Ryde agreed. "That is very annoying."</p>

  <p>"I had better ask William where he put them," Huneybell suggested, edging
  a little away.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that reminds me! I had quite forgotten. Before he went to his
  dinner&mdash;he went to his dinner just as you came in, by-the-by&mdash;he
  told me that the cases were in the cellar. Come along."</p>

  <p>The shadows of apprehension must have been creeping up from the recesses
  of Huneybell's mind. He made no movement.</p>

  <p>"The office, sir," he suggested, "and the front part of the
  warehouse&mdash;if William is out, ought we to leave them?"</p>

  <p>"Our business will not take us more than five minutes," Mr. Thomas Ryde
  replied. "There is nothing much to steal, and we shall hear the bell if the
  door opens. I must have your judgment upon the contents of these cases before
  you go for the afternoon."</p>

  <p>Huneybell glanced wistfully at the arched entrance through which they had
  passed. There was daylight up there, and safety, but between it and him stood
  Mr. Thomas Ryde with the invoice in his fingers. Suddenly he felt the
  latter's hand upon his shoulder, gently propelling him forward. He heard that
  voice with its eternal sameness, its everlasting lack of vibration or
  feeling, in his ears.</p>

  <p>"Huneybell," it said, "I do not like to accuse you of this, but I fear
  very much that you are taking to drink. It is an unpleasant thing to mention,
  but I notice it when you come into the office after your morning rounds. I
  notice it now. It is a foolish habit. Remember that presently you will be a
  very rich man. Do you want your happiness interfered with by ruined health?
  It would be absurd. Drink in moderation assists the digestion. Drink in
  excess destroys it. Ah, there are the cases! The lids are off, I am glad to
  see. There will be nothing to do but examine their contents. You go first,
  Huneybell. The steps are slippery. One might easily have a very nasty
  fall."</p>

  <p>All the time, relentless as the hand of fate, the fingers of Mr. Thomas
  Ryde had gently propelled his companion to the very extremity of that square,
  black hole, the trap door already fastened back&mdash;the hole which opened
  down into the cellars. At their feet was a straight, almost perpendicular
  staircase of wrought iron, and at the bottom a stone floor.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ryde!" Huneybell gasped. "You're right. I've been drinking. I'm
  giddy. I can't go down there. I'm ill. Come back to the office. I&mdash;I've
  something to tell you."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde's eyes glittered for a moment behind his spectacles. Huneybell
  felt a grasp like an iron hook upon his collar, a hand like the hand of fate
  pressing into his ribs.</p>

  <p>"You see, Huneybell," Thomas Ryde pointed out, and even then he neither
  raised nor lowered his voice, nor was there in it any trace of animosity,
  "the squealer, the traitor, always meets with his deserts."</p>

  <p>There was little sign of effort on Thomas Ryde's part; only one muffled,
  despairing cry from his victim. Down into the black chaos below, clutching
  vainly at the air, head foremost, Andrew Huneybell went crashing and tumbling
  into space. There was a dull thud. Thomas Ryde peered downward. Upon the
  floor was a dark, quivering mass. He drew away and listened. Upstairs all was
  silent.</p>

  <p>"Huneybell!" he cried out.</p>

  <p>There was no response, not even a groan audible at that distance, not even
  the sob of a flickering breath. Thomas Ryde listened once more. There was no
  sound upstairs. Very carefully, for the iron steps were indeed slippery, he
  descended into the cellar, and turned on the electric light. An ordinary man
  would have shrunk with horror from what he saw. Not so Mr. Thomas Ryde. He
  felt the pulse of the prostrate figure, turned it over slightly, and felt the
  heart. The froth on the lips, for which he looked, was there, and the
  creeping, deadly pallor for which he had hoped was also apparent, but there
  was still life. He looked around searchingly and lifted a slat from the lid
  of one of the cases. Then he stooped down once more and felt carefully round
  the back of the neck of the limp figure. He found the exact spot, balanced
  the slat in his hand, and struck. Not a groan. Just one little outlet of
  breath, scarcely a sob. Mr. Thomas Ryde stood up with the air of one who has
  accomplished a good task.</p>

  <p>Even then, he left nothing to chance. He turned the head a little, leaving
  the slat of wood exactly in its original position. Then he thrust his hand
  into the pocket of the dead man, took out a small leather case, and slipped
  it up his own sleeve. With a final glance around, he ascended the stairs and
  made his deliberate way through the second warehouse into the first. It was
  obvious that no one had entered, and as soon as he was assured of the fact,
  he went to a desk in a rough office which Huneybell had used for booking up
  his orders. He pushed open the lid, drew out a bottle of whisky which he had
  placed there an hour or so previously, poured some upon the floor, emptied
  some in the desk, and taking a glass from a deal toilet-stand, first filled
  it with liquor and then dashed it upon the floor. From there, he made his way
  to his own office. There were still no signs of disturbance of any sort. He
  carefully washed his hands, and afterwards went through his cautiously staged
  programme. He replaced his duster upon the peg, brushed his black coat, and
  put it on. Then he went out into the warehouse.</p>

  <p>"Huneybell!" he summoned.</p>

  <p>There was no reply.</p>

  <p>"Huneybell!" he called, a little louder.</p>

  <p>Still no reply. Thomas Ryde permitted himself a slight frown. Then he
  walked from the first to the second warehouse, and peered down into the
  cellar.</p>

  <p>"Are you there, Huneybell?"</p>

  <p>Still the same cold silence, which so far as Huneybell was concerned,
  would last through all eternity. Thomas Ryde descended a few steps of the
  ladder and turned on the electric light, which he had switched off on leaving
  the cellar. The body of Huneybell lay there in distorted and grotesque
  fashion&mdash;a hideous, nerve-shattering sight. He turned his back upon it
  and hurried to his office.</p>

  <p>"Dear, dear me!" he repeated to himself twice. "Terrible! Terrible!"</p>

  <p>He sat down at the telephone and demanded the nearest Police Station. A
  gruff voice answered him almost immediately.</p>

  <p>"Constable," he recounted, "this is number 6, Thugwell Row speaking, the
  office of Simon &amp; Co., importers of yarn. I fear that a very bad accident
  has happened here. My town traveller has fallen into the cellar, and I am
  afraid he's dead. Will you send a Police doctor and an ambulance, and come
  yourself at once."</p>

  <p>"I'll be round directly."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde reflected as he hung up the receiver. No, there was nothing
  else he could think of. He slipped down from his sleeve the letter case, and
  gazed with very bright eyes from behind his spectacles at its compromising
  contents. Then he did what seemed, for a man of careful habits, a strange
  thing. An ordinary scrap of torn paper he transferred methodically to his own
  pocket-book. The case itself, he took out to the rude little desk and placed
  under the lid. The three hundred and eight pounds in bank notes, without even
  a sigh of regret, he deposited in the middle of the fire which was burning in
  his office grate.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3><br>

  <p class="first">WITH sixteen hundred pounds neatly packed in an envelope by
  his side, Dutley calmly waited in his study from one o'clock until a quarter
  to two. He had lunch in seclusion and still waited. There was no sign
  whatever of Mr. Huneybell. It was a feeling of very definite uneasiness which
  made him at last ring for an early edition of the evening papers. Almost the
  first paragraph he saw told him the truth:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="headline">TERRIBLE ACCIDENT IN A CITY WAREHOUSE!</p>

  <p class="newspaper">A town traveller, named Andrew Huneybell, employed by
  the firm of Simon &amp; Co., yarn importers of Cannon Street, was to-day
  discovered lying dead in the cellar of the establishment. He appears to have
  slipped from the top of a flight of iron stairs, and broken his neck in the
  fall. The body has been removed to the mortuary, and an inquest will be held
  to-morrow or Friday. The deceased leaves a widow.</p><br>

  <p>Dutley threw down the paper. A queer feeling of remorse completely
  obliterated all sense of his own disappointment. Then he suddenly remembered.
  It was Huneybell himself who had taken the fatal plunge. He had been a doomed
  man from the moment when, of his own accord, he had rapped at the panels of
  the little house in Greenwall Avenue. Dutley rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"Burdett," he announced, as the man appeared, "we stay here to-night. Back
  to Greenwall Avenue to-morrow. Let Wolf know."</p>

  <p>"Very good, my lord."</p>

  <p>"What have you got on your salver?"</p>

  <p>"A note from Miss Bessiter, my lord."</p>

  <p>Dutley took the letter, and tore open the envelope. He read the few lines
  with a curious mixture of feelings:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">My dear Charles,</p>

  <p class="letter">It's no good. You've been away too long. You're rather a
  dear, but I've lost hold, and of course you know that I don't approve of you
  at all. Let's call it off. I have an idea that you won't mind very much.</p>

  <p class="letter">Affectionately,<br>
  Lucille.</p><br>

  <p>"The boy says that there was no answer required, my lord," Burdett
  ventured, on the threshold.</p>

  <p>"There is no answer," Dutley repeated.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE were all sorts of emotions in Grace's face as she
  sprang to her feet to receive her unexpected visitor. Her pleasure was
  obvious. It amounted almost to delight. With it was blended, however, a sort
  of tender disapproval. She might have been the little mother welcoming back
  the truant child, full of relief, yet a trifle hurt.</p>

  <p>"You amazing person!" she exclaimed, as he took both her hands. "Why do
  you behave in this mysterious fashion? Have you been for your expedition and
  got back again? Fancy disappearing altogether for nearly a fortnight and then
  walking in as though nothing had happened!"</p>

  <p>"I've been jolly busy, I can assure you," he protested, sinking on to the
  sofa by her side. "I've been to the other end of the world. What about your
  father?"</p>

  <p>"He turned up the day after I saw you last," Grace confided. "The reason
  he didn't go to the Midland was simple enough after all. He was so tormented
  with messages and callers the last time he was up that he decided to go
  somewhere else where he wasn't known."</p>

  <p>"Don't blame him," Dutley observed. "That was one reason I cleared out.
  They couldn't even leave me alone."</p>

  <p>"Poor Charles! Not that I really pity you in the least."</p>

  <p>"And where is this elusive parent of yours now?"</p>

  <p>"He came up from Leeds this afternoon to meet Mr. Watherspoon and Mr.
  Stephenson. They're going to have a meeting of the Directors and draw up some
  sort of a statement for the public. You mustn't go away again till you've
  signed it, Charles."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid my signature won't carry much weight anywhere," he sighed.</p>

  <p>She shook her head sadly.</p>

  <p>"I hate hearing you say that, Charles. This is really a terrible crisis in
  your affairs&mdash;in all our affairs. I do think you ought to take it a
  little more seriously."</p>

  <p>"My dear," he asked, "do I look as though I were meant to be a serious
  person?"</p>

  <p>"That's all very well," she protested, "but you must have some sort of
  brains or courage or something, or you couldn't organise and carry out these
  expeditions so successfully. The Thorolds asked me to dinner last night, and
  Sir Edward was talking quite a great deal about you. He was really very
  impressive. He told me that on two occasions, when there had been trouble
  with some of the tribes out in West Africa, the Government had given you
  special powers, and you had succeeded in settling matters up where the
  ordinary officials had failed. If you could do that sort of thing and never
  open your mouth about it, why can't you devote a little more of your time and
  thought to helping yourself and all of us over here?"</p>

  <p>He looked pensively into her softly appealing eyes, and his hand rested
  for a moment upon hers. She drew it quickly away.</p>

  <p>"This isn't a petting party, Charles," she reproved him. "Have you been to
  see Lucille since you came back this time?"</p>

  <p>"Lucille?" he repeated. "Why, didn't I tell you? Didn't you know that
  Lucille had chucked me?"</p>

  <p>"Lucille had what?"</p>

  <p>"Chucked me. Isn't going to marry me. Orange blossoms soms and St.
  George's all off! She's afraid she'll have to support me. Quite right of her
  too, especially as she's got a young millionaire in tow, or thinks she has.
  Didn't you gather that I'd come round here for consolation and not for a
  scolding?"</p>

  <p>"You'll find consolation easily enough," she assured him, "and I think
  you're telling me about Lucille just now to get away from what I wanted to
  say to you."</p>

  <p>"Well, come along, and let's have it out," he challenged. "What do you
  suggest that I should do? You know, or ought to know, just about what sort of
  aptitude I have for business. What could I do that your father couldn't do
  better?"</p>

  <p>"Father's too old for adventures. You might at any rate make an attempt to
  find the stolen formula."</p>

  <p>He tapped a cigarette upon the table and looked at it thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"That's an idea," he acknowledged. "What shall I do about it? Put an
  advertisement in the morning papers and offer a reward?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly, Charles," she begged. "You know perfectly well that
  wouldn't be any good. You'd have to be far more subtle."</p>

  <p>"I suppose I should," he mused. "I'll send out for a whole library of
  detective stories and see if I can acquire the sleuth instinct."</p>

  <p>"Well, even that would be better than another expedition," she declared.
  "It's this absolutely doing nothing which seems to me so terrible. After all,
  you have some responsibility, you know. It's practically your business that's
  going to ruin. They are your workpeople who are being discharged every day.
  Even the newspapers are beginning to hint that it's time they heard from you.
  These adventures in strange countries and the shooting of wild animals are
  all very well in their way, but the greatest adventure which could ever come
  to you in life would be for you to find the formula and set the business on
  its legs again. What a hero you would be in Marlingthorpe!"</p>

  <p>Dutley rose to his feet, walked to the window, and returned. He was in a
  restless frame of mind. The vague look had come back into his blue eyes.
  Grace sighed as she watched him. He had seemed somehow different on his first
  appearance. Already hope was slipping from her.</p>

  <p>"Grace," he reminded her, "this dingy hole in which you are living is,
  after all, an hotel, and from what I remember of the service a touch upon the
  bell there will produce the prompt attention of an excellent waiter. May
  I?"</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Charles," she apologised, as he leaned over and pushed the button.
  "I'm afraid I'm very inhospitable, but then you don't often take anything
  till just before dinner, do you?"</p>

  <p>"This evening," he explained, "is an exception to all rules. You have put
  an idea into my head. I feel that I could deal adequately with a Martini
  cocktail."</p>

  <p>A waiter entered, and she gave the order.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen your father since he came up to-day?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"He just telephoned. He's down in the City attending a company meeting
  with the Baron de Brest. How I hate that young man!"</p>

  <p>"Your hatred can be nothing to my loathing," Dutley groaned. "He is my
  supplanter. Lucille actually believes that she is going to marry him and his
  millions."</p>

  <p>"Well," Grace remarked, "I suppose he has brains."</p>

  <p>"Don't keep harping upon brains," Dutley begged, for him a little
  irritably. "I believe you think I'm a perfect idiot. I may astonish you some
  time, young lady."</p>

  <p>"When you find the formula, yes," she laughed. "Here's Father. I should
  know his tread in the corridor anywhere."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew entered the room. He greeted Dutley with an exclamation of
  satisfied surprise.</p>

  <p>"I was beginning to think you'd sneaked off the map," he declared. "I rang
  you up repeatedly at your house and got the usual reply, 'Away, and left no
  address.'"</p>

  <p>"Well, why should I be bothered to death by people I can't do anything
  for?" Dutley expostulated. "They drove me crazy the few days I was in Curzon
  Street."</p>

  <p>"The public have a right to hear from us," Sir Matthew said. "The only
  thing is, of course, that you are the wrong person to go to for information.
  The time has arrived, though, when we must face the thing. That's why I've
  come up to meet Watherspoon and Stephenson. We shall have to issue a
  statement. Lucky you're here to sign it, my lad. It will save a lot of back
  chat."</p>

  <p>"What sort of a statement can we issue?" Dutley asked. "Are we going to
  tell the whole world we can't make the stuff any longer?"</p>

  <p>"We certainly sha'n't go so far as that," Sir Matthew declared&mdash;"not
  if I have anything to say to it."</p>

  <p>A waiter appeared with the cocktails, and the evening paper, which Dutley
  promptly unfolded.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he exclaimed. "Things are looking brighter. 'Rally in
  Boothroyds.' Sir Matthew, we're up two points. Closed at fifty-four
  yesterday, and fifty-six to-day."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew, who was at the sideboard, mixing himself a whisky and soda,
  turned around with an exclamation of surprise. He looked over Dutley's
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"'Rallied two points on persistent buying,'" he repeated. "Now, who the
  devil can be buying Boothroyds, and what do they know about it?"</p>

  <p>"Sporting effort, anyway," Dutley remarked.</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew stared at the paper, frowning.</p>

  <p>"I'm damned if I can understand it!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"A stock exchange rig, eh?" Dutley suggested.</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Who in the name of common sense," he demanded, "can be buying Boothroyds
  when they've dropped every day for many weeks? There's something queer behind
  this. How many have you sold of yours, Charles?" he asked, turning towards
  him abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Not a share," was the prompt reply. "I told you I shouldn't."</p>

  <p>Grace smiled approvingly across at him.</p>

  <p>"I think that's fine of you, Charles," she murmured.</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew grunted.</p>

  <p>"It will do us good with the public, at any rate," he observed. "All the
  same, holding your shares may have steadied the market, but it couldn't
  account for a rise."</p>

  <p>Dutley drank half his Martini and toyed with the glass.</p>

  <p>"How large a buying order would affect the market to any extent?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, five or ten thousand pounds," Sir Matthew replied. "But who on earth
  would be likely to give a buying order for Boothroyds to-day, and what
  information could they be doing it on?"</p>

  <p>"Your friend Baron de Brest, perhaps?" Dutley suggested. "They say that he
  goes in for some quaint deals."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew dropped the paper. The hand which held his tumbler was shaking
  so that a portion of his whisky and soda was spilt. He set the glass down.
  His face was very grim.</p>

  <p>"What the hell do you know about De Brest?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Quite as much as I want to," Dutley rejoined, "and that's very
  little."</p>

  <p>"But why should you think that he, of all people in the world, should be
  buying Boothroyds just now?" Sir Matthew persisted.</p>

  <p>"Because I'm a congenital idiot for one thing, I suppose," Dutley
  confessed. "By-the-by, we haven't told you the news yet? Grace has been
  talking to me seriously, been preaching a sort of Holy War. We're going out
  together to look for the formula."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew finished his whisky and soda. After all, it was Dutley
  talking!</p>

  <p>"And what makes you think," he asked sarcastically, "that you can succeed
  where every one else has failed?"</p>

  <p>"Confidence," Dutley affirmed. "That's the way I blunder through my
  expeditions. Don't believe in danger and don't be afraid to use your
  imagination. Every one else is still hunting for clues. Grace and I don't
  believe in clues. We're going to pick out certain people and we're going for
  them. I may get my head broken, of course, and Grace may end in a prison
  reformatory, but we shall have made our little effort. In the meantime, if
  you can spare Grace, I should like to take her out to dinner&mdash;some quiet
  place where we can discuss our plans."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew strolled over to the hearthrug and lit a pipe in leisurely
  fashion.</p>

  <p>"Take her along certainly," he assented, "but you'd much better go to a
  theatre afterwards and not go looking about for trouble. The gang who've got
  hold of our formula and who have managed to keep Scotland Yard at bay so far,
  aren't likely to stand any nonsense from a couple of children like you."</p>

  <p>"We're not afraid of danger," Grace announced loftily.</p>

  <p>"We shall, in fact, court it," Dutley added.</p>

  <p>There was a low growl of anger from Sir Matthew, who had picked up the
  paper again.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Father?" Grace asked.</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew read aloud, and there was an indescribable bitterness in his
  tones:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">"Glenalton shares were a firm market, advancing one and
  a half to two points on the continued rumors of the Company's acquisition of
  large premises near Manchester for the manufacture of artificial silk.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"Boothroyds rallied two points, but no contradiction has
  yet been received of the very definite statements which are freely made as to
  the Company's heavy losses during the last few months. Sir Matthew Parkinson,
  the Managing Director of the Company, who is in London, declines to be
  interviewed, but announces that a statement will shortly be issued by the
  Directors. Lord Dutley, the Chairman, and nominal head of the firm, is
  reported to have started for a big game expedition within the last
  fortnight."</p><br>

  <p>Sir Matthew threw down the paper and picked up his hat. The expression on
  his face as he left the room after a brief farewell to Grace and Dutley might
  have suggested that he, too, was about to embark upon some sort of expedition
  of a punitive nature.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DUTLEY sighed as he glanced towards the entrance of the Club
  Restaurant.</p>

  <p>"Our luck's out, Grace," he remarked. "Having chosen Ciro's, in preference
  to any other place so that we might have a quiet talk, look what's happened
  to us."</p>

  <p>Grace laid down the menu which she had been studying and glanced across
  towards the threshold of the dining room.</p>

  <p>"My dear Charles, I'm so sorry," she exclaimed. "I'm afraid this means
  more trouble for you. I ought not to have let you bring me here alone."</p>

  <p>He scrutinised the three figures standing in the doorway&mdash;Lucille,
  very beautiful in a plain black dress of characteristic elegance, little
  colour on her face, but brilliantly red lips, her hair smooth and glossy, her
  eyes languorous but alert enough at that moment; Ronnie Bessiter,
  good-looking and well-groomed; De Brest, as immaculate as the tailor's art
  and his valet's aid could make him, a foreign ribbon in his buttonhole, his
  tie the latest model affected by the young bloods of the moment. They were a
  good-looking trio, and they were ushered to their selected table with much
  <i>&eacute;clat</i>.</p>

  <p>"What does it matter, old dear?" Dutley asked. "I told you this afternoon
  that it was all over between Lucille and me."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but that might only have been a quarrel," Grace protested. "You
  might have made it up in no time. I do hope this won't make it more
  difficult."</p>

  <p>Dutley became convincing.</p>

  <p>"Grace," he said, "I have been very fond of Lucille&mdash;I am still very
  fond of her&mdash;but she isn't the same girl that she was this time last
  year, and I regret very much to say that I don't feel the same way about
  her."</p>

  <p>"Charles, are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"Honest Injun! I am a commonplace young man, and there are some things
  which don't appeal to me. By this time in the evening, Lucille has smoked so
  many cigarettes and drunk so many cocktails, that indigestion with her has
  become a habit. You will see for yourself, if you watch, that she will take
  up that menu with a shiver. The thought of honest food will revolt her. She
  will complain that there is nothing there fit to eat and finally order some
  highly seasoned mess whilst the others go on their own. As to wine, she will
  probably declare that the first bottle of champagne is corked and the second
  too sweet. She will send for a cocktail to take the taste out of her mouth
  and then perhaps not touch her champagne till dinner is nearly over. It's a
  pity about Lucille, but she's a difficult companion. Now you, on the
  contrary&mdash;we had one cocktail at home and one here. You never smoke till
  after dinner. You ate every mouthful of your grilled sole and you made that
  poor little partridge look ridiculous. What you're going to do to this salad
  I don't yet know, but I hope for the best."</p>

  <p>Grace, once more at her ease, laughed happily. Dutley, looking into her
  eyes, which were really very beautiful eyes indeed, was amazed at her
  attractiveness. She, too, was wearing black, and although her figure had not
  the svelte elegance of Lucille's, there were indications that she owed less
  to the dressmaker's art.</p>

  <p>"What a dear you are, Charles!" she exclaimed. "You have made me feel
  quite contented again. When are we going to begin discussing our plans?"</p>

  <p>"I rather thought that it was the person with brains who took the
  initiative," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Not at all, it is the partner with enterprise," she insisted. "My brain
  will fashion a plan out of your enterprise."</p>

  <p>Dutley toyed with his salad thoughtfully. If only he dared! Then he caught
  her eyes watching him, and the position seemed to become more and more
  difficult. Half confidences would be useless. Supposing he told her
  everything! She would have the choice then of believing in him or her father.
  He knew her loyalty, and the risk seemed to him to be too great.</p>

  <p>"Before we get going," he begged, "can I make one stipulation? Anything
  that we may discover, any inspiration that may occur to you, any confidence
  which I may make, is our joint concern, and ours only. Not one single
  exception to that. Do you follow me?"</p>

  <p>"You're being awfully mysterious," she said. "You know I'm not a
  chatterbox though. You don't include Father in that, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I do indeed," he insisted. "I include everybody. I include your father,
  for one reason, because he is friendly with the young man whom I dislike and
  distrust."</p>

  <p>She reflected for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Very well. I agree."</p>

  <p>"Capital! Now we can get to work. In this business of ours, I propose that
  we commence by being intensely modern. You know the new method of crime
  detection, of course?"</p>

  <p>"I know nothing."</p>

  <p>"You work backwards," he pointed out. "You speculate and you arrive at a
  hypothetical conclusion. You treat that as being a real conclusion and you
  work backwards from it. If it's all right, you're home. If it's wrong, you go
  back to the beginning and start again on another tack, provided you haven't
  had your head broken or aren't in prison."</p>

  <p>"My dear," she cried, "this is beyond me! I resign my pretensions to
  equality. I must be your humble follower. I haven't any gifts of initiation
  like this."</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly," he admonished her. "You haven't tried. You'll find it
  quite interesting. We'll take our own case. Either five or six men are in
  possession of a document of priceless value, but upon which, mark you, they
  cannot realise at a moment's notice. I don't suppose they trust one another
  any more than thieves generally do. What would they do with the
  document?"</p>

  <p>Grace considered the question carefully.</p>

  <p>"Hide it," she suggested.</p>

  <p>"Not good," he disapproved. "They would all have to know where it was
  hidden and they would be none the better off. Try again."</p>

  <p>"Put it in a place which they all knew about, but which they could only
  get at together," she ventured, after a somewhat prolonged pause.</p>

  <p>He smiled benevolently.</p>

  <p>"You're getting very warm indeed," he assured her. "Now, what sort of a
  place would that be?"</p>

  <p>"I wonder," she mused.</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence.</p>

  <p>"What about a Safe Deposit establishment?"</p>

  <p>She patted his hand.</p>

  <p>"Clever Charles!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know," he said modestly. "It comes to you, if you think
  long enough. Having guessed thus far, the question arises which Safe Deposit
  Company? There's the Chancery Lane Safe Deposit Company, but, on the other
  hand, there's this marvellous new American concern, where every safe is
  insured for a large sum against either burglary or fire. Chambers of steel,
  they say&mdash;absolutely impenetrable."</p>

  <p>"I've read about it," Grace admitted a little doubtfully, "but after all,
  of course, this is simply guesswork, isn't it? They may just have deposited
  the formula in the vaults of a bank."</p>

  <p>"They may," Dutley acknowledged, "but in this case I don't think they
  have. I took a risk on the new place&mdash;I'll be honest&mdash;simply
  because I had seen an old employee of the Works in the same street. I hiked
  over a lot of fusty deeds that were hanging about in Curzon Street, took a
  safe there, and made friends with the Manager&mdash;charming fellow, with the
  aristocratic name of Hogg. I got chatty with him and I asked him what he
  would do if five or six people wanted to deposit jointly an enormously
  valuable deed, or casket of jewellery, in one of his safes. You know, Grace,
  they say 'fools for luck', don't they? I suppose that's where I come in. I
  got a bull's eye first time. 'Queer thing you should ask that,' he said. 'I
  had five gentlemen in all together the other day. They wanted to deposit a
  very valuable document and they wanted to do it so that not one of them could
  get it without the others.'&mdash;Do you know what their idea was? They
  carried it out too&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do tell it to me," she begged.</p>

  <p>Dutley glanced around. Their table was in a retired corner, and there was
  slight chance of his being overheard.</p>

  <p>"They had the ordinary stamped and numbered receipt," he confided, "made
  out in all their names. It was then cut into six pieces. Each took a section
  and one over for a man who wasn't there. When the contents of the safe are
  claimed, each fragment must be produced. Gummed together, you see, the
  receipt will then be in order."</p>

  <p>"What a fantastic idea!" she exclaimed. "Who on earth thought of it?"</p>

  <p>He paused whilst some newcomers passed their table.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you who thought of it," he replied as soon as they were
  safely out of earshot&mdash;"the brains of the burglars who stole the formula
  from the safe at Marlingthorpe. That's where the formula is, or
  was&mdash;deposited in Queen Victoria Street&mdash;and all we need to get it
  are six scraps of paper."</p>

  <p>She drew back and looked at him in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"But Charles," she exclaimed, "you've been working at this by
  yourself!"</p>

  <p>"Of course I have. I'm a bit of a slacker, I know, but I never had any
  idea of going abroad. My expedition took me just as far as Highgate."</p>

  <p>Her face was all aglow, her eyes shining with happiness.</p>

  <p>"You dear, dear Charles!" she cried. "You can't think how happy this makes
  me. But listen," she went on, clutching his arm eagerly, "knowing as much as
  you do, why can't you go straight to Scotland Yard?"</p>

  <p>"That's just where we fall down," he confided. "Don't you see the point?
  The formula is worth millions to us. It represents our very existence. To the
  police it means nothing. What they want are the men. The possession of the
  formula is the strongest proof of their guilt. Don't you see that they'd
  destroy it if necessary, the moment they had the slightest suspicion of the
  Police moving? And they're watching&mdash;watching all the time&mdash;as I
  found out the other night. I've been to Scotland Yard. I've talked to the
  Inspector who had the case in hand. We understand one another perfectly, but
  he's too honest a fellow not to admit that it's the men they'd go for all the
  time, and if I were to help them with a hint our formula would go phut."</p>

  <p>A slow, drawling voice, lazy but melodious, startled them. They looked up.
  Lucille was standing by Dutley's chair. He rose at once to his feet.</p>

  <p>"What on earth are you two talking about?" she asked curiously. "I have
  never seen such interest in my life. I call it positively indecent of you,
  Charles, to be dining out at all in public. You ought to be mourning in
  sackcloth and ashes at home. May I sit down for a moment? It may be good for
  your figure, but it looks so uncomfortable, Charles, to see you
  standing."</p>

  <p>She sank into the chair which a waiter had brought.</p>

  <p>"Confess," she continued. "You're trying to rob me of my young man, aren't
  you, Grace?"</p>

  <p>"Is he your young man any longer?"</p>

  <p>Lucille shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"He has been sentenced," she admitted, "but he still has the right of
  appeal. However, I didn't come over here to vent my jealousy upon either of
  you. I have come upon a business mission."</p>

  <p>"A pleasant one, I hope."</p>

  <p>"A stockbroker's daughter ought to think so. It certainly sounds like a
  good deal. Boothroyds to-day, Ronnie tells me, are fifty-six."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that's somewhere about the figure," Dutley acquiesced. "They
  went up two points to-day and they'll probably go up another two
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"I don't know anything about that," Lucille confessed. "All that I do know
  is that the Baron wants to buy some from you. He wants them for one of the
  foreign markets, so you can just hand over the shares and take the cheque. He
  wants five thousand, and instead of fifty-six, which is to-day's price, he is
  willing to give you sixty for them."</p>

  <p>"What a philanthropist!" Dutley exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I suppose he's what they call 'short'," Lucille murmured. "Seems odd to
  think of his getting caught, though. Every one says that he's such a
  brilliant speculator."</p>

  <p>"I take off my hat to him as an opportunist, anyway," Dutley remarked
  bitterly. "He hasn't lost time in making use of you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I like it," she replied, with a flash of anger in her dark eyes.
  "What about it, Charles? It seems to me it ought to be a good thing for
  you."</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately," he regretted, "I have promised that I would not sell any
  of my Boothroyd shares."</p>

  <p>"Promised whom?"</p>

  <p>"Myself."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"So Ronnie told me. What a Quixote! You could have sold half your holding
  at seventy, or something like that, and here you are landed with all of them
  at fifty-seven, and likely to go lower, I understand."</p>

  <p>"Well, we all have our funny little ways," Dutley remarked. "My
  compliments to De Brest, and my reply is&mdash;'nothing doing.'"</p>

  <p>Lucille looked at him earnestly.</p>

  <p>"You won't even sell five thousand?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Not even if I ask you to?"</p>

  <p>Her long, exquisitely manicured fingers rested upon his hand.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that this is in the best of taste, Lucille?" he asked, with
  mock peevishness. "You must not try to vamp me in front of Grace. We are
  spending a very pleasant evening and getting on together very well."</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly," she interrupted. "Grace doesn't mind. I am asking you a
  favour, Charles."</p>

  <p>"You are not," he rejoined. "That fellow De Brest is asking a favour
  through you. Now, it's very bad luck, but I dislike De Brest. Sooner than
  sell him any of my nice shares, I would bequeath them to a home for stray
  cats or anything. Besides, it would be an utterly illogical action. I would
  rather buy Boothroyds than sell them."</p>

  <p>Lucille rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Charles," she declared, "I never had any idea that you could be so
  obstinate."</p>

  <p>There was the faintest possible twinkle of humour in his eyes as he looked
  across at her.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes I think," he said, "that you have never really properly
  understood me, or you couldn't have preferred that fellow De Brest. May I
  take you back?"</p>

  <p>She waved him away and crossed the room alone, holding her wrap around
  her, a slim fragment of perfection, the last word in feminine modernity. Men
  watched her admiringly; women with the light of a greater compliment in their
  eyes&mdash;the light of envy.</p>

  <p>"Why are you so obstinate about selling any of your shares, Charles?"
  Grace asked.</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette and leaned towards her.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's rather like this, Grace," he explained. "I've got a bob or two
  outside the business, you know, and although I haven't got the commercial
  mind, it does seem to me that it's rather a rotten show to scuttle out in
  front of the shareholders just because you know what's coming. If this breaks
  us, it breaks us, and I'll take what's left ... Then, there's another
  reason," he went on. "I haven't much of a head for this sort of thing, but,
  so far as I can see, you can speculate on the Stock Exchange in two ways. You
  can buy shares you don't mean to pay for, and when settling day comes you pay
  your broker the difference if the shares are down, and he pays you the
  difference if they're up. Then there's another way. You can sell shares you
  haven't got, and the same thing goes on. The catch this way is that the
  Johnnies you sell them to might demand the shares in place of the difference,
  and then you'd be up a tree. Of course, as a rule, the jobbers see to it that
  they don't accept a deal unless they're pretty certain of being able to lay
  their hands on the shares, so there isn't much risk of trouble in England,
  but this fellow De Brest, I gather, besides being, as he calls himself, a
  banker, is mixed up with a lot of stockbroking and stockjobbing houses on the
  Continent where the game isn't played quite the same way, and I've an idea
  that he's sold more of my shares than he can deliver. If so, the position
  might be made exceedingly awkward for him, and somehow or other heaven
  doesn't seem to point out to me that I'm the Johnny to help him out of his
  scrape."</p>

  <p>Grace leaned back in her chair and laughed. She laughed whole-heartedly
  and unrestrainedly, showing her flawless, white teeth, the dimples on each
  side of her mouth deepening in curiously attractive fashion.</p>

  <p>"Charles," she exclaimed delightedly, "as the family fool, I think you're
  a fraud! Aren't you just a little ill-natured, though?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit," he rejoined. "It's simply this. De Brest is a young man,
  brilliant perhaps, wealthy he may be, whom I thoroughly and heartily dislike
  and mistrust. I'd do anything to queer his pitch with a pal. If Lucille
  marries him, I know she'll be miserable. There's no dog-in-the-manger spirit
  about it, I can assure you. If De Brest vanished into thin air to-morrow, and
  Lucille came back to me, there'd be nothing doing, but&mdash;dash it all!
  Here comes Ronnie now."</p>

  <p>The young man approached their table a little diffidently. He shook hands
  with Grace and turned to Dutley.</p>

  <p>"I say, old man," he expostulated, "aren't you being a bit rough on Siggie
  de Brest?"</p>

  <p>"It hadn't occurred to me. Take a chair, won't you? You'll be tired before
  you finish if you've come on the same errand as Lucille."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm not going to argue with you," Ronnie assured him. "You fellows
  who are not very good at business are always so plaguey obstinate."</p>

  <p>"How do you know Charles isn't good at business?" Grace interposed
  indignantly. "I used to think that, but I'm changing my mind."</p>

  <p>"Oh well, I've had plenty of opportunity for finding out," the young man
  confided. "Business isn't Dutley's line of country, and I'm sure I don't
  blame him. Look here, Charles," he went on, leaning a little closer and
  producing a piece of folded paper from his waistcoat pocket, "Boothroyds
  to-day are fifty-six, and would be a great deal lower but the market's
  temporarily blocked in them. Some fool's put in a buying order which has set
  the jobbers squealing. Listen though. The highest they touched this year was
  eighty. Here's a cheque for the amount. You've always been a pal of the
  family's, Charles. Fork out five thousand of your shares for Siggie, there's
  a good fellow."</p>

  <p>Dutley took the cheque into his hands and looked at it. Then he tore it
  deliberately into pieces and filled the young man's hands with them.</p>

  <p>"Ronnie," he begged, "let this be the end of it, please. I refused Lucille
  and that hurt a bit."</p>

  <p>The young man looked disconsolately at the pieces of paper in his hand.
  They seemed pretty effectually to put an end to all argument.</p>

  <p>"It isn't like you to refuse to help a fellow in difficulties," he
  remonstrated.</p>

  <p>"There are fellows&mdash;and the Baron Sigismund de Brest," Dutley
  rejoined, with a little farewell nod.</p>

  <p>Grace leaned across the table, a curious light in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I don't often see you in this mood, Charles," she wondered. "I only knew
  you really obstinate once before&mdash;when you were captaining the Yorkshire
  Gentlemen and wouldn't put Phil Saunders on to bowl because you doubted his
  action."</p>

  <p>"The fellow threw," Dutley insisted. "There was no doubt about that. Every
  second or third ball you could see his wrist go almost out of sight behind
  his back. We wanted to win, but we didn't want to cheat."</p>

  <p>"You did win after all, too," Grace remarked.</p>

  <p>"And we're going to win again," he promised her.</p>

  <p>Dinner drew towards a close. Dutley glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Care to dance?" he asked. "I'm suggesting it rather early because, as a
  matter of fact, I may have to clear out before very long."</p>

  <p>"Love to, Charles," she answered, rising to her feet.</p>

  <p>But there was to be no dance. A telephone boy, with a folded slip of
  paper, was already at the table. Dutley glanced at the message and crumpled
  it up in his hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm terribly sorry, Grace," he apologised. "I'll have to drop you at your
  hotel, and get along to my expedition."</p>

  <p>"As though it mattered!" she murmured. "I feel so happy to-night that I
  don't think anything would matter."</p>

  <p>He called for his bill. The orchestra was playing a most distracting
  waltz, but Grace, as she led the way from the restaurant, was deaf to its
  allure. The little party on the other side of the room watched them
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"I never thought that Grace Parkinson was so pretty," Ronnie murmured
  admiringly.</p>

  <p>Lucille stabbed out viciously upon a plate the cigarette which she had
  only half smoked and lit another. There was a queer, smouldering flame of
  anger in her beautiful eyes, but she remained silent.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3><br>

  <p class="first">AS they waited for their car, the young lady from the
  telephone booth stretched out her hand, and summoned the boy.</p>

  <p>"For the Baron de Brest," she directed&mdash;"urgent."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AN hour later, Dutley, practically unrecognisable in his
  shabby clothes, his ill-cut overcoat and tweed cap, opened the front door of
  number 115 Greenwall Avenue, with a latchkey, turned on the electric light,
  pushed open a door, and stood in his shabbily furnished parlour looking
  around him. There was no one there, no sound in the house. He lingered upon
  the threshold, listening for a moment. Then he made his way to the window and
  looked out through a chink in the curtain. There were no lights visible in
  the Towers, or any signs of life. He pressed the bell by the side of the
  fireplace. Almost at once there were footsteps in the passage. Dutley leaned
  forward.</p>

  <p>"That you, Burdett?"</p>

  <p>"Coming."</p>

  <p>An utterly transformed Burdett presented himself. He was dressed in a
  soiled check suit, his flannel shirt, with collar attached, was not above
  suspicion, he did not in the least resemble the neatly attired "gentleman's
  servant" of Curzon Street. Only his manner remained, its suave correctness in
  strange contrast to his appearance.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong, Burdett?" Dutley asked calmly.</p>

  <p>"Nothing that I know of. It's been a quiet day on the whole."</p>

  <p>Dutley drew a crumpled-up piece of paper from his pocket and straightened
  it out. He passed it across to Burdett.</p>

  <p>"That your message?"</p>

  <p>Burdett glanced at it and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I haven't telephoned you at all to-day. There's been no necessity."</p>

  <p>Dutley's hand stole into his pocket. He took out his revolver, broke it,
  and examined the cartridges. Then he replaced it, listening all the time.</p>

  <p>"Some one sent for me to come here, Burdett," he confided.</p>

  <p>"If it's a trap, we sha'n't do so badly," was the sanguine reply. "Tim
  will be up presently and one or two of the others. They wouldn't be reckoning
  on that."</p>

  <p>Dutley pulled aside the curtains and looked steadily across the way. He
  opened the window softly. There was scarcely a sound except the roar of
  traffic from the main northern arteries.</p>

  <p>"Well, there doesn't seem to be trouble about for the present," he
  remarked. "What's been doing?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing much. Mr. Ryde spent the day at his office, came home by the
  usual bus, and was playing the gramophone over the fire the last time I heard
  of him. The Baron slipped us for an hour in the City, but he was home to
  dress at the usual time. He called at Mr. Bessiter's house at eight o'clock,
  and he and the young lady and gentleman went on to Ciro's to dine. Mr.
  Hartley Wright was visiting film firms most of the day, but he called also on
  the Baron de Brest, and spent an hour with him before he dressed for dinner.
  Doctor Hisedale went straight from the Milan Court to his laboratory and
  hasn't stirred. Tim's at Ciro's. He won't leave there till he's seen the
  Baron back in his rooms."</p>

  <p>Dutley became suddenly tense. His hearing, more acute than Burdett's, had
  informed him of those faint, hesitating footsteps in the back passage. He
  listened to the creaking of the door. It opened inch by inch. With a little
  laugh, he replaced his revolver. It was Edward Wolf who made his tentative
  appearance. He glanced round the room anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Nobody else here?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Not a soul. How the devil did you get in?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I can always tickle that back-door key," Edward Wolf confided. "You
  want a bolt there, Guv'nor. A baby could walk into this house."</p>

  <p>"What are you up to here, anyway?" Dutley enquired, with a frown of
  annoyance. "Your job's in Curzon Street."</p>

  <p>"Nothing doing there to-night. There's a dance at the big house opposite,
  and there's a good score of bobbies hanging around, waiting for drinks and
  tips," Mr. Edward Wolf sneered. "There's nothing like a free blow-out and a
  crowd of white-shirted Johnnies to bring them into the air. They wouldn't
  hear a police whistle however loudly you blew it if an East End gang was at
  work, but they can always hear a kitchen-maid calling from the area."</p>

  <p>"You don't seem to like policemen," Dutley observed.</p>

  <p>"I 'ates them like poison, sir," Mr. Edward Wolf confessed, restraining
  himself at the last moment from spitting on the carpet. "They 'ates me too.
  I'm always so near being lagged and I'm always a thought too clever for
  them."</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you want up here?" Dutley asked. "Is there anything
  fresh?"</p>

  <p>The little man jerked his head towards the window.</p>

  <p>"What do you know about him?"</p>

  <p>"He's over there, spending a quiet evening with the gramophone."</p>

  <p>Mr. Edward Wolf indulged in a faint and rather sickly grin.</p>

  <p>"He ain't," he whispered, "or I shouldn't be here."</p>

  <p>Dutley was instantly alert.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door. Burdett, who had temporarily disappeared,
  re&euml;ntered the room. He glanced at Wolf. Dutley nodded.</p>

  <p>"All right, Burdett," he reassured him. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Word from two of the lads separately," the man announced. "The messages
  came on the kitchen telephone so quick I hadn't time to get in here between.
  Doctor Hisedale left the laboratory half an hour ago. He sent off for a taxi,
  and the direction was St. Pancras. The Baron, he had a telephone message at
  Ciro's and he's left his party there. He dismissed his car and took a taxi.
  My lad says it cost him half a sovereign to get the address out of the
  commissionaire&mdash;number 7a, Endale Street. That's near St. Pancras."</p>

  <p>The tinkle of the telephone was heard again outside. Burdett hurried away.
  Mr. Edward Wolf nodded approvingly.</p>

  <p>"Your lags ain't all stiff 'uns, Mister," he declared. "He got that
  address right. Might have saved myself the trouble of coming."</p>

  <p>Burdett made his hurried reappearance.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Hartley Wright has just left Bloomsbury, my lord. He was going to bed
  when he was called on the telephone. He is going to number 7a, Endale
  Street."</p>

  <p>"God, what's this?" Edward Wolf suddenly cried, shrinking back.</p>

  <p>The room seemed on fire&mdash;a red light everywhere. Dutley crept to the
  window.</p>

  <p>"The red light!" he exclaimed. "That means safety. They're coming up here
  then!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Edward Wolf, from the recesses of the room, chuckled.</p>

  <p>"I tell you what, Guv'nor," he said, "I bet you a new hat&mdash;and I need
  one pretty badly&mdash;that that lamp's a bluff. Whoever lit it, it wasn't
  Thomas Ryde. I seen him with my own eyes step out of a taxi in Shaftesbury
  Avenue not an hour ago. If I'd been one of your bright lads I might have had
  the pluck to follow him&mdash;and got mine, perhaps; him being him, and me
  being me, I hoofed it. You can judge for yourself whether I'm telling the
  truth, Guv'nor. I wouldn't be within these four walls if Mr. Thomas Ryde was
  opposite. As soon as I knew it was safe up here, I nipped across to a
  telephone, and sent you a message to come along."</p>

  <p>"What do you want now I'm here? What have you got to tell me?"</p>

  <p>"Him you're after and the others, they're meeting at 7a, Endale Street at
  eleven thirty. Your lags have told you that, but there's something more.
  There's one of them ain't been told&mdash;on purpose. They don't want him. I
  couldn't get his name, but it was Matthew something."</p>

  <p>"How did you find out all this?" Dutley asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Mr. Edward Wolf chuckled.</p>

  <p>"There ain't any one in this world, Guv'nor," he said, "who gives away the
  secrets of their jobs. What's that?"</p>

  <p>A limousine had stopped opposite. Dutley drew aside the curtains
  cautiously and peered out. From the light of a standard a little way up the
  street, he saw a familiar figure descend and ring the front-door bell of the
  Towers. He rang it once, twice, three times. At last some one appeared. There
  was a brief colloquy. The door was closed. Sir Matthew re-entered the
  limousine and drove away. Almost as he went, the red lamp shade disappeared.
  Dutley moved across the room, took up the telephone receiver, and asked for a
  number.</p>

  <p>"North 4600?" he demanded. "The Midland Hotel?... Good! Can you tell me if
  Sir Matthew Parkinson is in?... Not at present? Please take down a message.
  Tell him that his friend would be glad to see him at 7a, Endale Street at
  eleven-thirty to-night. An important discussion. Got that?... Thank you."</p>

  <p>Dutley rang off. He picked up his hat and overcoat.</p>

  <p>"You sit tight here, Burdett," he ordered. "I'm off to Endale Street."</p>

  <p>"I'm not to come along, sir?" the man asked, a little wistfully.</p>

  <p>Dutley shook his head.</p>

  <p>"If there's anything to do at all to-night," he said, "I fancy it's a
  one-man job."</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was a cold wind blowing down the broad avenues which
  sweep from St. Pancras and Euston westwards&mdash;a cold wind and drizzling
  rain. The windows of the taxicabs were fast closed and streaming. Men and
  women crouched under their umbrellas. The rain glittered upon the policemen's
  capes. It hung like misty fire around the electric standards. Across the
  shop-window front of the shabby restaurant at the far end of Endale
  Street&mdash;the restaurant which was scarcely more than a cookshop&mdash;was
  pasted an oblong strip of paper announcing "HOT MUTTON PIES." The smell of
  them filled the frowzy little place, so that even Luigi, the solitary waiter,
  came to the door for air, as he had done a few months before to escape from
  the heat and flies. He looked out with weary eyes upon the same sordid
  street, with its unenterprising shops seeming always on the point of
  bankruptcy, its hurrying streams of men and women, infected, as it appeared,
  in their carriage and bearing, by the depression of the mud and the rain, the
  dreary rows of smoke-stained, desolate houses. A man in a suit of soiled
  white overalls and a crumpled white <i>chef's</i> cap, called to him from
  behind the counter.</p>

  <p>"Them gents here yet?"</p>

  <p>Luigi shook his head dejectedly.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen not coma yet. No one in place."</p>

  <p>The cook considered the melancholy fact. Then he turned away.</p>

  <p>"All right. Tell them, when they come, the pies are ready, little
  Dago."</p>

  <p>Luigi scowled at him as he disappeared and once more looked up and down
  the street. Opposite, a taxi had just deposited a fare, a tall, thin man in
  spectacles who, as soon as he had paid the driver, crossed the way. Luigi
  stood on one side to let him pass.</p>

  <p>"Is the room ready?" the newcomer enquired.</p>

  <p>"Everything is a-ready," Luigi assured him. "You are the first. The
  vermouth, yes?"</p>

  <p>Hisedale nodded, passed through the little room behind with its three or
  four empty tables covered with soiled, coarse linen, upon which reposed an
  unappetising exhibition of chipped china, tarnished cutlery and thick
  glasses, turned the handle of a door on the left, and entered a sort of annex
  which differed only from the rest of the place by smelling, owing to its
  position above the kitchen, a little more strongly of stale food. He set down
  his umbrella in a corner and opened the window. The rain had beaten against
  his face and blurred his spectacles. He removed them, and, shading his eyes,
  looked out. All was well. The back way was clear, a wooden gate ajar, and the
  sombre shapes of a taxicab and a touring car were visible in the yard beyond.
  He turned around just as Thomas Ryde and Hartley Wright entered; the former
  carrying a heavy black bag. Thomas Ryde closed the door behind him and
  examined the fastening for a moment. Then he deposited the black bag in a
  corner of the room, and, standing by Hisedale's side, also peered out into
  the darkness. Greetings between the three seemed at a discount.</p>

  <p>"Is it all clear outside?" Mr. Ryde asked.</p>

  <p>"I have looked. I have seen no one," Hisedale reported. "The weather is
  too bad for loiterers."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde took the black bag from the corner and carried it down the
  narrow strip of walk as far as the gate. He pushed the latter open with his
  foot and placed his burden in the taxicab. When he returned, De Brest, in a
  long mackintosh over his evening clothes, had just arrived, and it soon
  became apparent that the young man was in a very bad temper indeed.</p>

  <p>"What the devil have you been doing out in the yard?" he asked
  suspiciously.</p>

  <p>Ryde glanced at the speaker with expressionless eyes. He deliberately
  shook out his umbrella and hung up his hat, before replying.</p>

  <p>"Stowing the bag away in the car."</p>

  <p>"What a pantomime!" the Baron scoffed. "It is child's play, what we do
  with that bag."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde surveyed him with the same steely gaze.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing of the sort," he declared. "The proprietor here, the cook
  and the waiter, they all believe the same thing. They believe that we arrive
  at St. Pancras from Harwich and that most weeks we're smuggling something. I
  daresay they think it is cocaine. We meet here to divide up. We are their
  best customers. They have no responsibility and therefore they keep their
  mouths shut. In all London, I do not believe that we should be safer than we
  are here."</p>

  <p>"Thank God," De Brest announced, "when you have listened to what I have to
  say, you will understand that very few more of these meetings are necessary.
  There is a matter to be decided first, however. What about Huneybell?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you read the papers?" Thomas Ryde answered. "He unfortunately never
  recovered consciousness after his accident. The evidence at the inquest made
  it very clear that he had fallen down the iron steps whilst in a state of
  partial intoxication."</p>

  <p>"That isn't what we're worrying about," De Brest argued brutally. "Where's
  his part of the receipt?"</p>

  <p>Luigi entered, carrying a huge tray nearly as big as himself. He placed a
  large dish containing six or seven mutton pies at the end of the table,
  removed the salt, pepper and oil and vinegar cruets from the sideboard, and
  arranged them in their places, whipped off the covers from the vegetable
  dishes, and drew the corks of the three bottles.</p>

  <p>"Anything more required, gents?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing at present," Thomas Ryde replied. "We will ring when we want
  you."</p>

  <p>The man departed. They took their places around the table, with the
  exception of De Brest, who filled a tumbler with wine, and threw himself into
  an easy-chair.</p>

  <p>"One must bluff sometimes, yes," he growled, "but I cannot eat this
  disgusting food. We know all about Huneybell's accident and death, but what
  about his portion of the receipt? Do you realise that we cannot claim the
  formula without it?"</p>

  <p>"I must confess," Thomas Ryde admitted precisely, "that it was the first
  thing which entered my mind as soon as I got over the shock of what had
  happened. Under the circumstances, I did what I considered was best in every
  one's interest. I searched his pocket-book, discovered the fragment of paper,
  and am now in possession of it. I am holding it for the common good."</p>

  <p>De Brest drew a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"That, I confess, is good news," he declared.</p>

  <p>"It is very good news indeed," Hisedale beamed. "Our friend has shown
  himself, as usual, a man of resource."</p>

  <p>"Darned good thing he was around," Hartley Wright agreed. "It means a nice
  little dollop more for all of us."</p>

  <p>"It was fortunate," Thomas Ryde assented. "The accident was in its way
  regrettable, but we have to bear in mind that Huneybell was drinking too
  much, and that a man who is continually in a state of semi-intoxication is an
  exceedingly dangerous associate in an enterprise like ours. Perhaps the time
  has come, Baron, for us to consider the proposition you desire to lay before
  us."</p>

  <p>De Brest stood up upon the worn and faded hearthrug. He had removed his
  mackintosh, and in the shabby little room he seemed to tower above the other
  men. In his correct evening clothes, with his sleekly brushed hair, his
  manicured nails, and undeniable air of breeding, he seemed to have found his
  way like an alien into strange company.</p>

  <p>"We had meant, I know," he began, "to hold the formula for at least a
  year, but circumstances alter cases. We are all in need of money. Why not
  help ourselves to what is offered, especially as there comes with the offer a
  certain measure of safety. The firm with whom I have been in negotiation are
  perfectly willing to allow themselves to be blindfolded. The Blunn formula
  has never been mentioned between us. They affect to believe that it is Doctor
  Hisedale's formula which they are buying. They are shrewd people and they are
  no more anxious to purchase stolen goods than we are to admit the theft. They
  will buy it then as Doctor Hisedale's discovery, and anything else they may
  guess or know will not even be hinted at. To carry out that idea, Doctor
  Hisedale will accept the position of senior chemist in the firm, and, with a
  board of twelve directors, and a great many other people intimately connected
  with the Works, only two will know that the formula under which they will
  commence to make artificial silk is really the Blunn formula."</p>

  <p>"This is very interesting," Thomas Ryde observed. "It appears to me to be
  a proposition eminently satisfactory in its initial stages at any rate.
  Continue, if you please, Baron."</p>

  <p>"The offer which I have had," De Brest went on, "is one which I do not
  think that any other firm in the world could make. They are prepared to give
  us one million pounds cash for the formula, and in legal, or perhaps I should
  say illegal, parlance, 'no questions asked.'"</p>

  <p>"One million pounds cash," Thomas Ryde repeated softly.</p>

  <p>"That is the wonderful part of it," the young man pointed out. "No shares,
  no waiting&mdash;just hard, negotiable cash."</p>

  <p>"Say, let's get on to this," Hartley Wright intervened, drawing a pencil
  from his pocket. "How many of us are there? Myself one, Hisedale two, Thomas
  Ryde three, Sir Matthew four, and you, Baron, five. Five into a million is
  easy. It's two hundred thousand pounds, or a million dollars each."</p>

  <p>It was a tense moment. The very mention of the money was agitating. Every
  one was silent. De Brest's face was twitching with emotion. There was even a
  gleam of cupidity in Doctor Hisedale's eyes. Thomas Ryde alone remained
  unmoved.</p>

  <p>"What about Sir Matthew?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, I guess he needs money just about the same as the rest of us,"
  Hartley Wright observed.</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt," Thomas Ryde assented. "That, however, is not the point
  which I had in my mind. Many years ago there was a bitter war between the
  houses of Boothroyd and Glenalton. Are we sure that Sir Matthew would consent
  to sell to them? He is an obstinate man and very unforgiving."</p>

  <p>"I have anticipated the difficulty," De Brest announced, "which is the
  reason why I suggested that Sir Matthew should receive no notice of our
  meeting to-night. I propose that he be not told until after the thing is
  decided, and he must then go with the majority. I am myself in favour of
  accepting Glenaltons' offer."</p>

  <p>"And I," Thomas Ryde agreed.</p>

  <p>"And I," Hisedale echoed.</p>

  <p>"Sure," Hartley Wright added emphatically.</p>

  <p>"Very good," Thomas Ryde said, pushing his chair back from the table and
  sipping his whisky and soda. "Three things only remain then. The first is for
  one of us to see Sir Matthew, acquaint him with the position, and secure his
  portion of the receipt, unless he chooses to come with us and redeem the
  document. The second is for us to arrange a date with Glenaltons upon which
  they will be prepared to hand over the money, and the third is to appoint a
  date upon which we shall pay our visit to Queen Victoria Street and secure
  the formula."</p>

  <p>De Brest tapped a cigarette against his case and stooped down to light
  it.</p>

  <p>"That date," he suggested, "had better coincide with the one fixed for the
  payment of the million pounds. I do not wish to have the responsibility of
  handling such a sum of money, certainly not of having it in my keeping for
  any length of time."</p>

  <p>"You shall not be troubled in that way," Thomas Ryde promised him. "We
  will all fetch the formula together. We will all receive the money together.
  We will leave you to deal with Sir Matthew. You are on friendly terms with
  him and can broach the matter at any time."</p>

  <p>Hisedale leaned forward in his place. He had the air of a man upon whose
  lips hung portentous words. Whatever they were, however, they remained
  unuttered. A tense and tragic silence reigned suddenly in the stuffy little
  room, with its soiled wallpaper, its terrible furniture, its spotted
  tablecloth and chipped, unsavoury crockery. A sense of drama, like an
  electrifying force, filled the frowzy atmosphere with acute and vivid
  pulsations. Every man's head was turned towards the door. Every man's face
  was drawn with the strain of listening. De Brest stole stealthily towards the
  glass door exit, and stood there with his left hand upon the knob. They heard
  Luigi expostulating, the cook and proprietor shouting, a chair overthrown,
  the tramp of approaching footsteps. Some one had entered the shop, had passed
  into the shabby apology for a restaurant beyond, and notwithstanding all
  remonstrances, had continued his progress, remorseless, heavy-footed. His
  voice was drowned beneath the shrill broken English of Luigi and the blatant,
  bawling cockney of the proprietor. They heard the latter's final protest.</p>

  <p>"I tell you them gents ain't going to be disturbed. That's a private
  dining room they've got, and if they'd been expecting of you or any one else
  they'd have let me know, or Luigi here. Sit down and eat what you want. You
  can send in word to them if you've a mind to. They are regulars, that's what
  they are, and there's no call for you to come along bothering them.... No,
  you don't!"</p>

  <p>There was the sound of a brief struggle, a heavy fall upon the floor, and
  Luigi's shrill voice raised in terror.</p>

  <p>"I fetcha the police! I go for police!"</p>

  <p>There followed the rasp of a man's harsh laugh, the footsteps of the
  intruder coming rapidly nearer, and finally a ponderous, determined knocking
  upon the door.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">NO ONE answered the summons. The silence in the room
  appeared to have in it qualities now almost of hysteria. De Brest was
  crouched before the window, his pale face drawn, his eyes filled with terror.
  Hisedale was shaking visibly. His lips kept on meeting and parting again, but
  no audible words escaped him. Hartley Wright, with an ugly look upon his
  face, had risen to his feet and seemed about to join De Brest at the window.
  Thomas Ryde, whatever he may have been thinking, sat with his head bent a
  little forward and the usual glitter in his eyes, the only form of emotion in
  which he ever indulged. He was, without a doubt, the least disturbed of the
  little company, but underneath the sheltering covering of his left hand was
  the dull gleam of a revolver.</p>

  <p>"Who is there?" he called out.</p>

  <p>Again the knocking. This time, Thomas Ryde rose to his feet. He glanced
  around at his companions contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"Remember," he warned them, "no clumsy explanations. Leave speech to me.
  If it is the police, wait till we hear the charge."</p>

  <p>With firm fingers, he turned back the key, and with his hand on the butt
  of his still concealed revolver, he threw open the door. Sir Matthew,
  portentous, flushed and furious, stepped in.</p>

  <p>"What the hell's all this about?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Their eyes devoured him. De Brest strolled back to his place and tried
  hard to appear at his ease. Hisedale took off his spectacles and polished
  them, laughing stupidly at himself all the time. Hartley Wright stretched out
  for his glass, which he had only recently refilled, and drained its
  contents.</p>

  <p>"Well, what's it all about?" Sir Matthew repeated. "What are you all
  meeting here in secret for, without any word to me? Is there any fresh
  trouble?"</p>

  <p>Curiously enough, as the other three men began to regain their composure,
  Thomas Ryde for the first time showed signs of losing a portion of his. He
  gripped the newcomer by the arm.</p>

  <p>"What brought you here, Sir Matthew?" he asked. "How did you find out
  where to come to?"</p>

  <p>"How did I find out where to come to?" the other boomed. "I like that,
  Thomas Ryde! Has any one a better right to be here? My mind misgives me that
  you have met to discuss this offer of Glenaltons. Am I right or wrong?"</p>

  <p>He swung around, and faced Sigismund de Brest, and the latter, although
  pusillanimously, took up the challenge.</p>

  <p>"Why not, Sir Matthew? We are all concerned in this. We have all run the
  same risk&mdash;greater risk than you&mdash;greater risk than any sane man
  ought to take on. We want to get out of it as quick as we can."</p>

  <p>"We do&mdash;like hell!" Hartley Wright put in vigorously.</p>

  <p>"That's right," Sir Matthew growled, his eyes filled with contempt, as De
  Brest cowered away from him. "Enter into a dirty enterprise and then kick
  yourself for being a fool afterwards. Whine about it. That's what your type
  do. If there's any man here should kick himself and go on kicking himself for
  the rest of his life, I'm that man, and not you, you coward! Put that sort of
  talk on one side, young man, and listen to me. Listen to me, all of you. Have
  you been discussing the sale of Blunn's formula to the Glenalton
  Company?"</p>

  <p>"We have," Thomas Ryde admitted. "Furthermore, we have arrived at a
  decision. We are all in favour of accepting the offer."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew towered up before them, his head nearly reaching to the
  cracked, smoke-stained ceiling. For a moment, one had a vision of Samson in
  the temple. One felt that this man could, if he would, stretch out his arms
  till the walls fell apart and brought down the rotten, crumbling masonry upon
  the sullen little circle of men.</p>

  <p>"I've got my portion of the receipt," he reminded them, "and without that,
  as you've acknowledged yourselves, no one can touch the formula. I tell you
  this first and last. I'll see the formula burn in the fire before it ever
  reaches the Glenalton Works. Do you hear me, all of you? Is there more to be
  said about it?"</p>

  <p>"A very great deal, I am afraid, Sir Matthew," Hisedale answered. "The
  formula may be worth more if we could afford to wait, but we can't. We all
  need money. So far, we have run great risks for an insignificant return. I
  know that it was at first proposed to lock the formula up for several years,
  but that, after all, is an unsatisfactory business. Our nerves are on edge.
  The Glenalton people are the only firm in the world who could offer us a
  million pounds in cash and no questions asked. They are willing to accept the
  formula as mine, which will do away with all suspicions. They will give me a
  position in their Works. You must forget your prejudices, Sir Matthew. You
  are in a minority. We all want to sell and wind this business up. Remember,"
  he concluded, dropping his voice a little and glancing nervously towards the
  door, "you are not in the same position as we are. You were not concerned in
  the actual burglary. We have run a greater risk and our need of recompense is
  greater."</p>

  <p>"And don't you think I loathe you all for it?" Sir Matthew thundered. "Did
  I want poor old Rentoul shot? He'd been in the Works for forty-five years,
  man and boy. Do you think that I should have let you inside the place if I'd
  known that harm was coming to him?"</p>

  <p>"He had to be removed," Thomas Ryde said curtly. "He might have recognised
  one of us and he was the only one who knew enough of the formula to have
  carried on for a time without it."</p>

  <p>De Brest stretched out his hands.</p>

  <p>"Why discuss these things?" he begged piteously. "Why bring up again these
  horrible details? We have to deal with the position as it stands, not as it
  might have been. Sir Matthew, we must beg you to come in with the rest of us.
  We shall never have another chance of touching cold cash like this. You read
  about Huneybell's accident and death?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I read about it," Sir Matthew admitted, his shaggy eyebrows meeting
  in a black frown, and suspicion lurking in his eyes as he looked across at
  Thomas Ryde. "Queer reading it made, too!"</p>

  <p>"It was an unfortunate accident," Thomas Ryde confided. "Huneybell has
  been drinking heavily for the last few weeks and he would probably have found
  his way to Scotland Yard before long."</p>

  <p>"Anyway," De Brest went on, "Ryde has his portion of the receipt, and we
  are dividing up his share. That makes two hundred thousand pounds each, Sir
  Matthew. As soon as you hand over your portion of the receipt, or come with
  us to the Safe Deposit Company, if you don't trust us, we can make our final
  arrangements. We can touch that million within a week's time. I suppose in my
  way," he concluded, "I'm the richest man here, but I don't mind confessing
  that I have too many irons in the fire. I need the money. I want to touch my
  share of that million next week."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew eyed the young man with distaste.</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt you do, lad," he declared, "but you won't, if I can help
  it. Now, listen to me, Thomas Ryde, and all of you. I've a notion of my own
  about the formula. Watherspoon and Stephenson are both back. They're fairly
  warm men, and there's still something to be raised on the credit of the
  Company. Dutley's a poor creature, but he'll do as he's told. He could borrow
  money on his shares and he has other means. We'll buy back the formula for
  the firm. We'll give, say a couple of hundred thousand pounds in cash, and
  the rest when we get going again. As for my share, divide it up amongst you.
  I'm sick to the bottom of my soul of the whole business&mdash;sick to God
  that I ever touched it. That's nowt to do with any one but myself, though. I
  can play the go-between, and work the thing all right. You'll not run the
  risk in selling back to us that you would in selling to any one else."</p>

  <p>"I have heard what Sir Matthew has to say," Thomas Ryde observed coldly.
  "I am still in favour of selling the formula to Glenaltons for a million
  pounds cash."</p>

  <p>There was a little chorus of assent&mdash;nothing wavering about it
  either&mdash;firm and decided assent. Sir Matthew looked around at them all
  grimly.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you'll change your minds later, gentlemen," he said. "Mark you,
  you're no nearer your million. I've got my share of the receipt and I sha'n't
  part."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde leaned forward in his place.</p>

  <p>"There is something," he said, "which we have all forgotten. Sir Matthew
  has never answered our question. How did he know where to find us to-night?
  Who invited him to come?"</p>

  <p>They all looked towards Sir Matthew. He scowled back at them.</p>

  <p>"I came because you sent for me. I didn't want to come. I told you I
  wanted to be kept out of it all."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, we sent for you?" Thomas Ryde demanded.</p>

  <p>"Here's the telephone message," Sir Matthew said, spreading it out upon
  the table. "I don't mind telling you that I was just getting into bed when it
  was brought up. I'd been to your house in Highgate, as it happens, Thomas
  Ryde&mdash;to have a talk with you&mdash;but, although your red light was
  burning, you weren't there."</p>

  <p>They bent over the oblong strip of white paper, pushing one another away,
  clawing one another like animals, hot-breathed and terrified. It looked so
  harmless&mdash;a neatly pencilled message on a regular form, at the top of
  which was printed:</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><span class="smcap">midland hotel telephone service</span></p>

  <p class="letter">Come to-night eleven-thirty 7a, Endale Street meet friend.
  Important discussion.</p><br>

  <p>Thomas Ryde was the first to break away. Even his precise voice shook a
  little as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I take it that not one of us here was fool enough to send that telephone
  message?"</p>

  <p>There was a murmur of universal dissent. They all confronted one another,
  and there was terror and suspicion in their faces.</p>

  <p>"If none of you sent it," Sir Matthew insisted, "who did? Who else knows
  about your meetings? Has any one given the whole b&mdash;&mdash;y show
  away?"</p>

  <p>There was no answer. Each was struggling with the problem in his own
  manner. Sir Matthew pointed down to the strip of paper.</p>

  <p>"Some one knew that you met here," he went on. "Some one knew that I
  didn't usually come to your meetings. It can't be the police. They wouldn't
  do a roundabout thing like that. Who, outside this room, knows all our
  affairs?"</p>

  <p>De Brest was walking up and down like a madman.</p>

  <p>"I wish to God I'd never touched the damned business!" he sobbed.</p>

  <p>"I wish to hell I was back in New York!" Hartley Wright muttered.</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew looked at them all with scorn.</p>

  <p>"Well," he jeered, "you're a fine gang of desperadoes for the police to
  lay their hands on. Four mousetraps would hold the lot of you."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde leaned over and rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"Be silent all of you," he directed sharply. "There's some one moving
  about outside. We may as well know all there is to be known."</p>

  <p>Luigi answered the summons with surprisingly short delay.</p>

  <p>"Wanta bill?" he queried. "I got him here."</p>

  <p>He handed it over. Thomas Ryde, without a glance at the details, counted
  out the money and added a crisp, white bank note. The little Italian's eyes
  danced with joy as he pocketed it.</p>

  <p>"Any one been asking about us to-night, Luigi?" Thomas Ryde enquired.</p>

  <p>"Not a word. Not a customer since nine o'clock. We sent out twelve mutton
  pies to the Angel opposite. No other business. Very good place, this, for
  gentlemens who like to keep quiet&mdash;gentlemens who bring things back from
  Holland in their bag," he added, with a little snigger.</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde looked composedly around at his companions.</p>

  <p>"Luigi is our friend," he reminded them. "He knows why we meet here. He
  knows what is in the bag outside in the car. We all trust Luigi. You heard
  what he said. No one has been round here making enquiries of any sort."</p>

  <p>"Never any one," the little waiter declared, with impressive fervour. "If
  any one aska, I say, as you told me&mdash;'commercial travellers from the
  country.' Never a word about Holland. Do not fear, gentlemens. With Luigi,
  you are safer here than anywhere."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde nodded.</p>

  <p>"Good night," he said. "We will let you know when we are coming
  again."</p>

  <p>"The boss says when you finish will you leava the back way," Luigi begged.
  "You can leava door open. No one care. Nothing to steal. In the front, we
  close the door. The boss likes his glass over at the Angel."</p>

  <p>With a series of bowed good-nights, and a wonderful feeling of uplift from
  that note in his pocket, the little man left the room with a prayer in his
  heart for all good, generous smugglers. Thomas Ryde thrust open the crazy
  door leading into the yard. The rain outside had ceased, but the darkness was
  intense. With the help of an electric torch he reached the door which led to
  the outer yard. The taxicab was still waiting, also the touring car.</p>

  <p>"Any one been round?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"Not a soul," the taxicab man answered. "Hope you won't be long, Guv'nor.
  I'd like to get through my job before the pubs close."</p>

  <p>"We are coming now," Ryde told him. "In any case, I'll see that you have a
  drink."</p>

  <p>He made his way back to the fusty little room, where the others eagerly
  awaited him.</p>

  <p>"I do not believe," he announced deliberately, "that there is any urgent
  need for alarm. The car and the taxicab are both there, and no one has been
  around. I regret having to remind you, however, that we have arrived at no
  conclusion. The existence of that mysterious telephone message to Sir Matthew
  makes an immediate decision necessary. Some one outside our circle knows
  about us. That is not a very pleasant thought for us to take away. I have a
  shelter waiting for me which I do not think that any one in the world will
  ever discover, and the sooner I find myself there, with the best part of two
  hundred thousand pounds, the better I shall be pleased. Sir Matthew, under
  these very alarming circumstances, you must give in."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew laughed grimly.</p>

  <p>"I can see your gun," he said, "but you needn't think you can terrify me.
  Besides," he went on, "the person who sent that message for me to come to
  this place must have known whom I was going to meet. They'd know where to
  look if I was found here in the morning with one of your dirty bullets under
  my skin. You dare not do it, Thomas Ryde. You're asking for the rope even
  when you think about it."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde changed his position slightly. He was between Sir Matthew and
  the door now. De Brest, obeying a silent summons, stood by his side. Doctor
  Hisedale tore the paper off a phial which he had drawn from his waistcoat
  pocket. They were all around Sir Matthew, just out of striking distance.</p>

  <p>"Put your gun away, Hartley Wright," Thomas Ryde enjoined. "You won't need
  it. Professor, bring the needle out from your phial when I give you the word.
  If anything should happen to you, Sir Matthew, you won't be found here. I can
  promise you that. We have two cars outside, you must remember. We don't want
  to use violence, except in case of an emergency. Doctor Hisedale, with a
  single jab of his needle, can do all that is necessary so far as you're
  concerned. Now, listen, Sir Matthew, please. It is not worth your life to be
  obstinate. We don't wish to rob you of anything. Notwithstanding your
  abnegation of it, you shall have your share of the Glenalton million if you
  wish. Put your pocket-book upon the table. Unpleasant things will happen to
  you if you don't before I count five&mdash;One...."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew looked around the little circle. He seemed to be making up his
  mind which way to spring.</p>

  <p>"Two."</p>

  <p>"Three."</p>

  <p>"Four."</p>

  <p>Suddenly De Brest started.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he whispered hoarsely.</p>

  <p>The situation was arrested for a moment, but Sir Matthew knew well that
  there was murder lurking in that little phial from which the needle was now
  half withdrawn, murder behind the lenses of those gold-rimmed spectacles of
  Thomas Ryde. Outside, in the back restaurant, they could see through the
  chinks in the door that a light had been lit. They heard Luigi's shuffling,
  unwilling footsteps and the lighter tread of a belated customer. Then a
  voice&mdash;a well-bred, pleasant voice, notwithstanding its slight
  drawl&mdash;a voice, too, which to more than one person in the room seemed
  faintly familiar.</p>

  <p>"Hope I'm not keeping you up. My train was two hours late, and I'm hungry.
  I should like to try one of your mutton pies, a bottle of stout, and the
  evening paper."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"WHO is waiting for me?" Sir Matthew exclaimed, sitting
  suddenly up in bed.</p>

  <p>"The Baron de Brest is asking if he can see you for a moment, sir."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew swung himself on to the floor.</p>

  <p>"What infernal cheek!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. Shall I tell the Baron to wait in the salon?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so. Turn on the water in the bathroom."</p>

  <p>The man obeyed, and in quarter of an hour, Sir Matthew, considerably
  refreshed by his cold bath, still in his dressing gown and bed-room slippers,
  entered the salon. De Brest, throwing away his cigarette, rose impetuously to
  greet him.</p>

  <p>"You've a pretty good nerve, young fellow," Sir Matthew growled. "What the
  hell do you want to see me about?"</p>

  <p>"I want to apologise for last night&mdash;and explain."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew seated himself in an easy-chair.</p>

  <p>"I don't want your apologies, and I shall believe just as much of your
  explanation as I choose," was the sour comment.</p>

  <p>"Have you found out who telephoned to you?" De Brest asked feverishly.</p>

  <p>"Must have been one of you."</p>

  <p>"But I tell you it was not," De Brest cried. "I will be frank with you.
  You were the last person we wanted there. We did not mean to come to you till
  the day for releasing the formula."</p>

  <p>"I'll admit," Sir Matthew grunted, "that I didn't seem altogether a
  welcome visitor, but there's one of you must be playing a lone hand. Who is
  there outside your gang could get to know that you were going to meet last
  night at a wheezy little cookshop like that?"</p>

  <p>De Brest was shaking.</p>

  <p>"If one of us was playing what you call a 'lone hand', Sir Matthew," he
  protested, "what was he to gain by dragging you there? Cannot you see that
  for yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's something to know where I stand with you all," Sir Matthew
  acknowledged, after a brief pause. "A b&mdash;&mdash;y gang of
  murderers!"</p>

  <p>"Now, Sir Matthew," De Brest begged, "do not get thinking that, I implore
  you. What we put up on you last night was a bluff."</p>

  <p>"A bluff, eh?" Sir Matthew repeated incredulously.</p>

  <p>"It was neither more nor less than that," the young man declared. "Hartley
  Wright's gun was not loaded, and I am very certain Thomas Ryde's was not
  either. He has had enough of that. Hisedale's needle might have put you to
  sleep for a few minutes, but that was the greatest harm it could do. We are
  not a pack of fools, Sir Matthew. With two hundred thousand pounds each
  staring us in the face, and the danger of the other affair not over yet, you
  cannot believe that we were going to commit a stupid crime which must have
  been found out. Remember the telephone message. I wish to God I could forget
  it. Some one knew where you were&mdash;some one, I should say, more likely to
  be your friend than your enemy."</p>

  <p>"You'd have had my pocket-book," Sir Matthew muttered, "if that customer
  hadn't walked into the back shop."</p>

  <p>De Brest hesitated. Protestations had perhaps been carried far enough.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Sir Matthew," he agreed, "they meant having the paper."</p>

  <p>"They!" Sir Matthew flung back at him.</p>

  <p>"We!" De Brest almost shouted. "We do not wish you harm, Sir Matthew. No
  one wishes you harm&mdash;especially I. We have been friends, and to put it
  straight, you still owe me money. I do not want harm to come to you, but I
  agree with the others, your obstinacy in this manner is damnable prejudice
  and selfishness. It is not reasonable that four other men who have risked
  their lives and liberty should be made to suffer for your damned foolishness.
  So that's that, Sir Matthew. I would have joined in hocussing you. I would
  have seen the paper stolen, but also I would have seen that you had your
  share of the money afterwards."</p>

  <p>"You sound more like telling the truth now, lad," Sir Matthew
  acknowledged. "All the same, I'll never but believe it was lucky for my skin
  that some young man took a fancy for a mutton pie. As to owing you money,
  there's a talk coming between you and me about that."</p>

  <p>"The talk is useless," De Brest affirmed. "I should very much like a
  little of the money."</p>

  <p>"You have made plenty, haven't you, out of your rotten companies?" Sir
  Matthew asked him bitterly.</p>

  <p>"We have been unfortunate together," De Brest confessed. "That happens
  sometimes in financial operations. I gave you the choice of several of my
  interests. You happened to choose some that turned out worse than the
  others."</p>

  <p>"I chose the ones you advised."</p>

  <p>"Not in all cases," De Brest declared. "I told you that I was financing
  Dulkopf Irons, for instance, but I barely even suggested your putting money
  in."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew leaned forward in his place.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "I've finished with you anyway if life ever goes
  running along any sort of wheels again, so I'll just tell you what's in my
  mind about you and Dulkopf Irons. We were talking investments&mdash;it was
  before I'd known you long, so I'd got a bit of brass. You're right in what
  you said. You didn't press me to buy Dulkopf Irons. You seemed to be rather
  trying to put me off, and I wondered why. We were talking that morning in the
  sitting room of your suite at the Milan, and the telephone rang in the next
  room. You excused yourself and left me alone. Your portfolio was open on the
  table. Plumb on the top of everything was a letter with '<span class=
  "smcap">Dulkopf</span>' at the top of the sheet. Was that letter left there
  for me to read, young fellow?"</p>

  <p>"If it was in my portfolio," De Brest rejoined, "can you imagine that that
  was the case? Should I have left my portfolio open if I had thought that you
  were the sort of man to pry into its contents?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I believe you would and I believe you did," Sir Matthew answered.
  "We're down to plain words, you see, now. Anyway, I did read the letter,
  though it was marked 'private.' From the chief engineer of the Works, wasn't
  it, begging you to sell no more shares? Contracts rolling in. A new process
  that was going to save thirty per cent, in smelting. A hundred thousand
  pounds certain profit in the first eight months. Yes, I read the letter,
  young man, and I believe you meant me to ... No, wait a bit! I haven't done
  yet. What about that telephone conversation? You left the door ajar&mdash;not
  purposely, I suppose, eh? I couldn't help hearing, if I'd wanted
  to&mdash;hearing you getting angrier and angrier with a man who was begging
  for some Dulkopf shares. I even heard the end of the conversation.</p>

  <p>"'It's no good, Mr. Hirsch,' you were saying. 'The news has reached you, I
  suppose, but I couldn't sell you any Dulkopf shares if you made me a present
  of ten thousand pounds. I haven't so many left, and they're pledged to a
  friend who has been in with me in one or two concerns that have not come out
  quite so well.'</p>

  <p>"Very nice&mdash;very straightforward&mdash;all of it! Out you came with a
  word of apology for having been so long. You'd been talking to Hirsch, the
  great iron master. You didn't mention Dulkopf shares, but when we parted that
  morning, you had my cheque for eighty thousand pounds. You were almost in
  tears to part with the shares, but you did it."</p>

  <p>Amongst many of his acquaintances, Sigismund de Brest passed for a
  good-looking man. At that moment, he was a very striking exemplification of
  the oft-quoted saying that "good looks are the expression of the soul rather
  than a physical attribute." There was an almost venomous light in his
  peculiar coloured eyes. His flabby mouth owed the little strength which it
  possessed to the indrawn, malicious curve of his upper lip. It was the face
  of an under-bred and angry satyr.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Sir Matthew," he snarled, "you have lost your money, and you
  whine, and you are rude, and you are stupid. I shall offer you no more
  explanations. I have helped you with your Dulkopf calls, and if you did not
  know what the constitution of the company was, and what your liabilities
  were, then you must be a very bad man of business. You will have to pay the
  rest of the calls this year, and that is why, if you are not a fool, you will
  get this two hundred thousand pounds. For the rest, I have no more to say to
  you. You are too pig-headed. Some one else can come and argue."</p>

  <p>De Brest produced his huge cigar case, lit a cigar, and rose deliberately
  to his feet. Sir Matthew also rose.</p>

  <p>"You are leaving?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It is useless to argue with you further," De Brest declared.</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew gripped him by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Listen, young fellow," he enjoined, "there's a little man I know whom I
  haven't much respect for, and who's rather a weakling, but whom I've liked
  better ever since I heard, a week or so ago, that he'd knocked you down."</p>

  <p>"If you are referring to Dutley," De Brest said, removing his cigar from
  his mouth, "he took me by surprise. I was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not taking you by surprise," Sir Matthew interrupted. "I'm
  going to kick you out, De Brest, and I hope I never see your slimy face again
  unless we stand in the dock together. Do you hear that? And now&mdash;out you
  go!"</p>

  <p>The struggle was unworthy of the name. De Brest was as flabby as a man who
  smokes strong cigars, drinks all day, and sits up all night, indulges in
  every form of dissipation and takes no exercise, could well be. He finished
  in the corridor, groaning and puffing, helped to his feet by two not very
  sympathetic servants. Behind his locked door, Sir Matthew lit his early
  morning cigarette, threw the window wide open, and rang for his
  breakfast.</p>

  <p>A crisis is sometimes exhausting, sometimes stimulating. The present one,
  Sir Matthew found very much to his taste.</p>

  <p>"Got rid of that damned young swine, anyway," he kept muttering to
  himself, as he finished his toilette, and shook out the <i>Times</i>.</p>

  <p>The Stock Exchange notes puzzled him. There was persistent buying of
  Boothroyds, which rose to fifty-eight notwithstanding adverse rumours. In the
  street, after hours, they were offered down to fifty-six. Still persistent
  buying of Boothroyds! Sir Matthew threw down the paper and commenced to fill
  his pipe. There was a knocking at the outside door of his suite.</p>

  <p>"Come in!" he called out.</p>

  <p>The door was opened and closed. There was a similarly cautious tap at the
  inside door.</p>

  <p>"Come in!" Sir Matthew repeated, a little impatiently.</p>

  <p>The door was thrust open. De Brest made a tentative entrance.</p>

  <p>"Good God! You again? Haven't you had enough?" Sir Matthew exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Can I have just one friendly word with you, Sir Matthew?"</p>

  <p>"Friendly be damned! What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"I am here in your interests," De Brest assured him earnestly. "I have a
  proposition of great importance to put before you. Will you consent to listen
  to me for five minutes?"</p>

  <p>"I think it would probably amuse me," was the scornful reply. "Come in,
  and don't look so scared. I've had my fun for the morning and I know all
  about you now."</p>

  <p>De Brest closed the door behind him, and carefully keeping the table
  between himself and the man he had come to visit, drew out a chair.</p>

  <p>"Sir Matthew," he began, "owing to circumstances which we know of,
  Boothroyds shares have already fallen more than twenty points, and in the
  course of the next few months will probably be of very little value at any
  price."</p>

  <p>"That's your opinion, is it? You should read the <i>Times</i> this
  morning, my lad. 'Persistent buying of Boothroyds.' What do you think of
  that?"</p>

  <p>"The paragraph was misleading. Boothroyds were scarcely dealt in at all
  yesterday. It is reported that there was a buyer, but scarcely any shares
  came on the market."</p>

  <p>"Well, what's this to do with your turning up here again?" Sir Matthew
  demanded gruffly. "I thought I'd given you hint enough that you weren't a
  particularly welcome visitor."</p>

  <p>"Do not refer, if you please, to that unfortunate incident," De Brest
  begged, with an attempt at dignity. "You lost your temper, and it is not my
  custom to strike an older man. I told you that I had come in your interests.
  Tell me, how many of your Boothroyds shares have you sold?"</p>

  <p>"What the hell's that got to do with you?"</p>

  <p>"Please restrain yourself, Sir Matthew. It would be very much to your
  benefit to answer my question."</p>

  <p>"I should like to hear anything from you which would be to my benefit!"
  Sir Matthew growled. "However, I'll try you out. I've twenty-five thousand
  shares left and ashamed of myself I am for admitting it. That poor little
  boob of a Dutley who hasn't sold a share is more of a man than I am."</p>

  <p>"Listen," De Brest enjoined, leaning a little across the table. "Last
  night's price was fifty-six in the street, fifty-eight in the House. I'll
  give you sixty-two for your twenty-five thousand. You can go and buy them
  back again in an hour if you want to and take your profit, and you need not
  be afraid of my depressing the market here with your shares either. I want
  them for abroad."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew shook with ponderous laughter.</p>

  <p>"Oversold, are you, young man?" he jeered. "And settling day next Friday!
  It's young Dutley's done that, bottling up half the shares. God bless the
  lad!"</p>

  <p>"I need the shares from some one who is an actual holder," De Brest
  explained, with an attempt at calmness, "to complete a large deal I made on
  behalf of some clients on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. I'm offering you a
  profit of five or six thousand pounds, which I hope you will put in your mind
  against some of the losses we have made together."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew pointed with the stem of his pipe towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Young man," he said, "I'm glad you came back. I've enjoyed your visit,
  but if you take my advice you'll go whilst your two legs can carry you. If
  you want my answer, here it is. I wouldn't buy a share from you, or sell a
  share to you if there was a fortune in it. That's straight, mind you. I'm a
  plain Yorkshireman who's made a bit of brass, most of which you've lost for
  me, but if you came here with the bank notes you've skinned me of in your
  hands, I'd still see you out of the place as I'm going to in ten seconds if
  you don't make yourself scarce."</p>

  <p>De Brest picked up his hat. He reached the door before he ventured to
  speak. From that point of vantage he looked back. Whatever flowers of speech
  he had prepared, however, he abandoned. Sir Matthew had risen to his feet,
  and was approaching with the lunging walk of an old footballer. De Brest
  hurried out.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE sensation of the eagerly anticipated but informal
  meeting of the Directors of Boothroyds, Limited, was, without a doubt, the
  unexpected intervention of the Chairman of the Company. He had been looked
  upon as so completely a figurehead that even his presence was a surprise to
  every one. Mr. Wendell Cooke, senior partner in the celebrated firm of
  Wendell Cooke, Matthew &amp; Gordon, the great solicitors, who had just
  finished reading from a roll of papers, looked across the long table with
  evident astonishment.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, Lord Dutley. What was that you were saying?"</p>

  <p>"I was remarking," Dutley replied, "that I don't altogether approve of the
  statement."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wendell Cooke was not the only person there who was astonished. Mr.
  Stephenson, who had scarcely spoken half a dozen words in his life to Dutley
  and who looked upon him as the merely nominal holder of his position as
  Chairman, and Mr. Woofington, who had accepted the general view that he was a
  brainless young ass who signed and said what he was told to, also received
  something of a shock. Colonel Armitage, a third Director, summoned in a hurry
  and who had been whispering with Sir Matthew at a corner of the table, leaned
  back and looked at the young man as though not quite certain whether to
  believe his ears or not.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," Dutley repeated. "But if you come to think of it, it gives the
  whole show away, doesn't it? Too pessimistic. Too much like taking a licking
  lying down. Wants a bit of Yorkshire in it, I think."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wendell Cooke glanced down the typewritten sheet which he held in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"In drawing this up," he said, with dignity, "I conceived it to be the
  duty of the Directors to place before the investing public the main facts
  concerning the approaching collapse of our business."</p>

  <p>"Collapse my eye!" Dutley remarked cheerfully. "We shall be through all
  this trouble in a year's time."</p>

  <p>The Solicitor was speechless. Mr. Stephenson, who bitterly resented the
  whole situation&mdash;especially being dragged back to England in the middle
  of December&mdash;was mildly sarcastic.</p>

  <p>"Is that, may I ask, the expression of a natural optimism, Lord Dutley, or
  have you any grounds for supposing that we shall be able to recover the
  knowledge which our chemists seem to have lost?"</p>

  <p>"What I think," Dutley explained, "is this. Our formula has been stolen,
  we've made a lot of bad stuff, we're cutting the thing down now by curtailing
  manufacture, and at the end of the year we shall know just about what the
  loss has been. What I object to in the statement is that it takes a hopeless
  view of the situation. It seems to take it for granted that we're going on
  making muck all next year as we have done this. I don't believe it. I believe
  that, before many weeks or months have passed, either by purchase or through
  the police, or by other means, we shall have our formula back. By working
  overtime and setting on all hands we can employ, we shall be able to pick up
  our trade and right ourselves altogether within twelve months. Any one who
  read Mr. Wendell Cooke's statement would say that Boothroyds was a ruined
  firm. Not it! I should say it's a foggy day, and you've all got the pip, when
  you thought of sending that to the newspapers."</p>

  <p>"Have you any foundation, Lord Dutley, for this rather refreshing optimism
  of yours?" Colonel Armitage asked.</p>

  <p>"As much foundation as Mr. Wendell Cooke has for his blasted pessimism,"
  Dutley rejoined. "That formula, I conclude, is still in the hands of the men
  who stole it, and my opinion is they're going to find it damned difficult to
  get rid of. We're all taking it for granted," Dutley went on, "that Scotland
  Yard have made a complete muddle of this business. I'm not so sure. The
  trouble for us has been those two murders. Scotland Yard want the man who
  fired those shots rather than our formula, and that's where we suffer. All
  the same, I can tell you this. They are watching every factory in Europe or
  the States where our formula would be of the slightest use, and with the
  least signs of expansion, or change of manufacture, they'd be stirring. What
  I say is, that our enterprising burglars have got hold of a white elephant. I
  shouldn't be surprised if they weren't trying to plant it back again in the
  Zo&ouml;logical Gardens of Marlingthorpe for a consideration before
  long."</p>

  <p>"I find Lord Dutley's faith in the powers of Scotland Yard a little
  touching," Stephenson observed. "How are they going to interfere in the
  private business of a firm who chooses to change its method of manufacture?
  We all know, of course, the rumour that's going about now&mdash;that
  Glenaltons have made wonderful discoveries through this new chemist,
  Hisedale, and that they're going into the art silk business on a huge scale.
  Now, supposing it's our formula they've got hold of, Hisedale wouldn't keep
  the original. Who's going to tell that what he gives down to them wasn't his
  own invention?"</p>

  <p>"Just so," Dutley drawled. "On the other hand, such a success on the part
  of&mdash;what did you say the man's name
  was&mdash;Hisedale&mdash;thanks&mdash;would immediately turn the limelight on
  to him. Scotland Yard would at once begin to enquire as to his movements on
  the night of the burglary, as to his associates, and a few other little
  matters. I read a good many detective stories and I find this crime business
  rather interesting."</p>

  <p>"Aren't we&mdash;er&mdash;rather wandering from the point?" Mr. Wendell
  Cooke suggested. "If my statement is not satisfactory to Lord Dutley, perhaps
  he can suggest an amended one."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I couldn't write anything of the sort to save my life," Dutley
  protested. "What I should say, though, is, put a little more pep into the
  thing. Give them something to hope for. You publish this, and I should think
  our shares would be down to forty in no time. Supposing they find that we
  Directors haven't got rid of our shares, that we've even perhaps been buying
  a few, they may think that we were influenced by personal
  considerations."</p>

  <p>The Solicitor shook his head sadly.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid," he said, "that in their own justifiable interests and in the
  interests of their families you will find that the Directors have already
  disposed of a considerable portion of their holdings."</p>

  <p>There was a dreary murmur of assent from around the table. Dutley polished
  his eyeglass carefully.</p>

  <p>"Well," he continued, "I am a bit of a mug at business, of course, but I
  don't mind telling you that I have not sold a single one of my five hundred
  thousand shares. On the contrary, I have bought between thirty and forty
  thousand within the last ten days and I still have a buying order out."</p>

  <p>This time no one any longer doubted but that Dutley's place was the
  madhouse. Sir Matthew shook his head pityingly.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity you didn't ask the advice of those who know, Lord Dutley," he
  regretted. "It was a very foolish thing to do. You've just been holding the
  price up for others to get out."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wendell Cooke coughed, but before he could break into speech, Mr.
  Bessiter, who was present for the first time by right of his position as
  broker to the Company, but who up till now had remained wrapped in gloomy
  silence, rose to his feet and, with the palms of his hands upon the table,
  leaned forward.</p>

  <p>"You'll forgive me," he begged. "This has been a confusing afternoon. I
  can't make up my mind whether I have properly understood what Lord Dutley
  said. Did you say that you have not only not sold one of your shares, Dutley,
  but that you have bought between thirty and forty thousand during the last
  few days?"</p>

  <p>"That's quite true, Mr. Bessiter." Dutley acknowledged, smiling at him
  pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"But aren't we&mdash;aren't my firm&mdash;your brokers?" Mr. Bessiter
  demanded. "I've heard nothing of this."</p>

  <p>"Certainly you are my brokers for ordinary business," was the courteous
  reply, "but as I happened to know that your firm were manipulating a very
  large 'bear' account against Boothroyds I thought that it was better for me,
  in this instance, to put my business through other hands. My purchases, as a
  matter of fact, have been made through my Bank."</p>

  <p>There was a queer silence. As Dutley had remarked earlier in the
  afternoon, it was a foggy day outside, and little wisps of the yellow vapour
  had found their way into the room. The handful of men gathered round the
  table, with their varying expressions, formed a strange, almost
  Rembrandt-like study. Every one was looking towards the slight, perfectly
  groomed figure of the smooth-faced, sunburnt young man who was standing up at
  the head of the table swinging his eyeglass by its cord. He alone seemed
  unruffled, imperturbable. There was even a slight smile hovering at the
  corners of his lips. Sir Matthew's fine, worn features were lined with the
  agony of the last few months. Mr. Bessiter's handsome face was darkened by
  something like fury. Perhaps astonishment was the chief characteristic
  amongst the others, but the fog-dimmed, almost grotesque light thrown
  downwards from the green-shaded lamps hanging from the ceiling seemed to
  intensify the emotions variously depicted. It was a business meeting only,
  beyond a doubt, but there was a tragic background to the whole thing. Then,
  too, there was this element of surprise&mdash;this suave young man, a
  revelation, making so equably his astounding statements. Somehow or other, he
  imparted a vague sense of confidence, a faint belief that behind the mask of
  his genial insouciance he knew more than he chose to tell. Mr. Bessiter's
  remark, which first broke the silence, was in the nature of a soliloquy.</p>

  <p>"One knew, of course, that there was buying," he muttered, "and that it
  came from Barclays Bank, but no one ever dreamed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dutley smiled down at him cheerfully. He stopped short.</p>

  <p>"Since you are so much interested, Mr. Bessiter," he continued, "I may as
  well tell you that I have buying orders out for another hundred thousand
  pounds' worth as they come upon the market. The trouble is, however, I
  gather, to get hold of the shares. There appears," Dutley went on, looking
  calmly round on the little company, "to be rather a shortage. In fact, I have
  been approached to know whether I would be content to let delivery stand over
  on some of the parcels."</p>

  <p>"And what was your reply?" Mr. Bessiter enquired.</p>

  <p>"I declined. My bank seemed to think that the matter was more or less
  unimportant, but, like all ignorant people, I had a fit of obstinacy. I
  declined. I said that the shares I bought for delivery on a certain date I
  wished to have upon that date. Why not?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Bessiter sat down heavily. Mr. Wendell Cooke took up the running. It
  was noticeable that he addressed his Chairman in an entirely different
  tone.</p>

  <p>"This discussion, curiously and gravely interesting though it has been,"
  he said, "scarcely helps us towards the completion of the business on hand.
  Do I understand, Lord Dutley, that you refuse to sign this statement?"</p>

  <p>Dutley nodded good-naturedly.</p>

  <p>"That's right," he agreed. "I'm not signing that. Reads like a death
  warrant. It would bring tears to the eyes of thousands of people to-morrow if
  that appeared. Give them a margin of hope. That's what I say."</p>

  <p>"This is not intended to be a literary document," Mr. Wendell Cooke
  pointed out. "It is meant to be a statement of fact."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," Dutley assented, "but think. The burglary took place last
  July; we're now in December. I take it that the profits of the first six
  months of the year will pretty well wipe out the losses of the last six
  months. The worst that's going to happen is that there's going to be no
  dividend this year, unless we pay it out of reserve. By next year, the
  chances are we shall have the jolly old formula back again, and people will
  be all the more anxious for the stuff."</p>

  <p>"Look here, young man," Sir Matthew intervened, breaking a long silence,
  "is there any sense in what you're talking? What do you know about it,
  anyway? You were in Abyssinia when the theft took place. You don't understand
  what it means for us to try to work without it. You're playing the quixotic
  idiot about your shares, but you've no call to interfere in a statement you
  can't know anything about. You can't judge. You know nothing about the
  business. You've been content to be a figurehead. You never pretended to be
  anything else. I consider the statement which Mr. Cooke has drawn up for us
  to sign is a reasonable one. The outlook is worse than gloomy. It is
  damnable! If you won't sign it, will you retire from your position as
  Chairman of the Directors?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'll be shot if I will," Dutley replied firmly. "Vote me out, if you
  like. I sha'n't go unless."</p>

  <p>"Lord Dutley's present position," Mr. Cooke remarked drearily, "gives him
  complete control. At the present moment, I should say that he must own more
  than half the entire number of shares issued."</p>

  <p>"So that's that!" Dutley said, smiling round at them.</p>

  <p>"I should like to remark," Mr. Wendell Cooke continued, "or rather to tell
  you, Lord Dutley, as solicitor to the Company, that if no statement is
  forthcoming I do not envy you your position when you meet your shareholders
  on the first of February."</p>

  <p>Dutley's smile broadened.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever, by chance, Mr. Cooke," he enquired, "met face to face an
  angry rhinoceros who is very hungry, who has lost his wife, and whom you have
  had the misfortune to slightly wound?"</p>

  <p>"I have not," the Solicitor admitted.</p>

  <p>"Well, I have," Dutley confided, rising to his feet, "and I'm not going to
  be afraid of any shareholders. If you will come, or send a messenger, Mr.
  Cooke, round to my house in Curzon Street at any time before eight o'clock
  this evening, I will give you five or six lines which I think, in our present
  condition of uncertainty, is all in the nature of a statement which we ought
  to issue for the moment. Good afternoon, gentlemen! One word of farewell," he
  added, leaning forward in his place. "You've heard about Glenaltons, and
  you're all fancying to yourselves very likely that Hisedale's already got the
  formula, and that they're getting ready to make the stuff. I'll bet
  you&mdash;any of you&mdash;a hundred to one, first that no copy has been made
  of the formula, and secondly that not a soul has seen it since a day or two
  after the burglary&mdash;Any one want a lift up West?"</p>

  <p>No one moved. They were all too anxious to discuss together, in his
  absence, the question of their Chairman's sanity.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"IF only," Sigismund de Brest almost moaned, as he drew his
  partner closer to him, "we could get away from this accursed party!"</p>

  <p>"My dear," Lucille replied a little pettishly, "it cannot be done just
  yet. For some reason or other, home was like a seething volcano to-night.
  Father isn't fit to speak to, and he and Ronnie were talking furiously
  together for half an hour before we started. You're in it, too, somehow or
  other. When I said that you were going to be here, they did what they haven't
  done for weeks&mdash;they decided to come themselves, and as you know, this
  is the first moment I have been able to get away from them. What have you
  been doing, Siggie?"</p>

  <p>"Not a thing," he assured her. "It is that foolish young man Dutley who
  has made trouble for me. Tomorrow, the next day, all will be well again. Not
  so soon as then, perhaps&mdash;next week."</p>

  <p>"Let's sit down," Lucille suggested. "You're dancing like some wooden
  thing in the Russian Ballet."</p>

  <p>"We will drink some champagne," he proposed.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose I ought to talk," Lucille admitted lazily, "but I do
  think that you drink all that is good for you, Siggie."</p>

  <p>"You should see me at home&mdash;in my own castle," he said eagerly, "when
  the season of sport is on. I drink scarcely anything. I love better the
  outdoor life. You heard my aunt, Princess Elizabeth, what she had to say
  about that. It is this London life&mdash;the excitement. Lucille, I am tired
  of it. By the end of next week, if all goes well, I shall have made my second
  million. We will go to Cannes directly we are married, yes? I have
  particulars of a villa there I think I shall buy, and I will leave
  money-making alone for a time."</p>

  <p>They sat at a small table, and after the first glass of champagne De Brest
  recovered himself to some extent. Ronnie found them out presently.</p>

  <p>"Dull party," he remarked laconically. "The Governor and Mater have just
  cleared off."</p>

  <p>"Thank God!" De Brest murmured.</p>

  <p>"They left Lucille in my sacred charge," Ronnie, continued. "Now I rather
  wanted to run into the Club for half an hour."</p>

  <p>"Don't be so blatant, my dear Ronnie," she drawled. "Where will you pick
  us up so that we can go home together, that's all I ask?"</p>

  <p>"Jennifer's at three o'clock?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be late," Lucille begged. "I expect I shall be bored to death with
  Siggie before then."</p>

  <p>"I'll be there round about three," Ronnie promised.</p>

  <p>"Your people have gone," De Brest pointed out, as soon as they were alone
  again. "Surely there is no need for you to stay any longer? This is boring
  you stiff."</p>

  <p>"The trouble is," Lucille observed, "that I can't think of any other place
  that would bore me less."</p>

  <p>"Come back with me for half an hour."</p>

  <p>"Where to?"</p>

  <p>"To my rooms. We can sit over the fire and talk of our plans."</p>

  <p>She eyed him speculatively, a curiously enquiring light in her gaze, the
  faint curl of her beautiful lips mocking him.</p>

  <p>"What an obvious person you are, Siggie," she complained. "I wouldn't mind
  going to your rooms in the least if I wanted to, only it would bore me. There
  would be no music, I'm out of cigarettes, and you might think it your duty to
  make clumsy love to me. I've been to Charles's house often and sat and
  talked, but then, although I hate him now, he is really a dear. He kissed me
  in the car quite decently, but he barely touched my fingers in his house. I
  wonder whether you're like that, Siggie?"</p>

  <p>There was an angry gleam in the young man's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk to me any more about that young tailor's dummy," he begged. "I
  am tired of him. He is not a man. He is a cold-blooded killer of animals and
  collector of insects. About him I have something to say, yes, but not here.
  If you will not come to my rooms, let us go to Jennifer's."</p>

  <p>"Will it be open?" Lucille asked doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"It will be open but deserted. That is what I like. We will go into that
  little bar, into the alcove where there are easy-chairs, and we shall be
  alone. I will tell you how you can do me a great, great service."</p>

  <p>"The trouble about you," she remarked, as they moved towards the door, "is
  that you always want some one to be doing something for you. Even Ronnie says
  that."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but how can that be!" he expostulated. "I have given to your father's
  firm much of the business of my house. Soon I shall give more. When we are
  married, they shall have everything."</p>

  <p>Lucille made no reply. She did not speak again until they were in the car.
  She suffered him to hold her hand there, but evaded his caress.</p>

  <p>"Are you very rich, Siggie?" she enquired.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he confessed. "I am not very rich. I mix always with rich people in
  New York and Paris and Berlin and I know that I have little."</p>

  <p>"What do you call little?" she persisted.</p>

  <p>He leaned back in the limousine and tapped the ends of his patent shoes
  with his Malacca cane.</p>

  <p>"I keep a background of money always," he said, "with which I do not
  speculate. That is about a million pounds. That I keep invested in New York
  and Boston in bonds. It is a foolish thing to do for I only get five per
  cent., but it gives me security. Then, of my other money, six hundred
  thousand pounds is very sound indeed. In addition I have four hundred
  thousand pounds with which I am speculating. With some portion of that,
  Lucille, I will admit that I have made a slight mistake. Still, even now, I
  am confident, I shall make that four hundred thousand a million. With that, I
  shall have two million, six hundred thousand pounds. Then I think I
  finish."</p>

  <p>"What," Lucille asked, "is the interest at five per cent on say two
  million?"</p>

  <p>He made imaginary figures in the air with the end of his stick.</p>

  <p>"About a hundred thousand pounds a year," he decided.</p>

  <p>Lucille nodded.</p>

  <p>"We could live on that," she admitted.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THEY found Jennifer's very much as De Brest had predicted
  and ensconced themselves in a corner of the deserted bar. For once in his
  life, however, De Brest was obviously ill at ease. Lucille studied him
  curiously, but made no effort to help him.</p>

  <p>"Lucille," he asked at last, "would you very much like that jade necklace
  we saw at Cartier's the other day?"</p>

  <p>"The one they wanted two thousand pounds for? I'd sell my soul for
  it."</p>

  <p>"You shall have it on Saturday," De Brest promised, "if you will do
  something for me."</p>

  <p>"Something very terrible?"</p>

  <p>"Not very. You have the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> to Dutley's house in Curzon
  Street, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I had, I suppose," she admitted, "if I wanted to go there. That's
  rather a thing of the past though now, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily. His servants would never refuse to let you go in."</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to steal something of poor Charles's?"</p>

  <p>"Not steal," he denied eagerly. "Borrow. It would do him no harm either.
  He will be better off."</p>

  <p>"Something to do with his shares, I suppose."</p>

  <p>De Brest was fluent enough now.</p>

  <p>"It is not so much a matter of money," he explained. "It is a matter of
  honour with me that I should be in a position to produce a certain number of
  Boothroyd shares within the next few days. Dutley knows that. He would have
  sold his shares readily, but he feared they would come into my hands. He is
  holding them up at his own loss solely to embarrass me. He is a very spiteful
  man, Lord Dutley."</p>

  <p>"You should hear Father talk about him," Lucille confided. "He seems to
  have given them all a shock down in the City this afternoon. He refused to
  sign a statement, or something, and then he electrified all the Directors by
  announcing that he had not sold a single one of his shares, and that, on the
  contrary, he had been buying them."</p>

  <p>"It is the act of a lunatic," De Brest declared vehemently. "He
  buys&mdash;they fall a little&mdash;he buys again&mdash;what is it for? He
  can never hope to keep the price up with his paltry means and if he kept up
  the price, what is the good of it? The business is ruined. Every one knows
  that. There will be no dividends. The truth will be known everywhere before
  long. The shares will fall from sixty to twenty or thirty. Dutley will be
  ruined. For what purpose?"</p>

  <p>Lucille tapped a cigarette upon the table.</p>

  <p>"Once or twice lately," she meditated, "I have wondered whether Charles
  was such a fool as he seemed."</p>

  <p>"Then you can leave off wondering," De Brest remarked curtly. "He is one
  of the most complete fools I have ever met in my life. Fortunately it is
  himself he is ruining. You are very lucky to have broken with him, Lucille.
  If you had married him, you would have had to live on your own little
  fortune."</p>

  <p>Lucille shivered.</p>

  <p>"Don't suggest anything so terrible," she begged. "I like the sound of
  your income better. A hundred thousand a year, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>"About that," he answered. "Enough for us both, I think, Lucille.
  Concerning that jade necklace&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lucille considered the matter.</p>

  <p>"Of course I could get into Charles's house all right, on any excuse, but
  how on earth should I know what to look for, or where? Besides, he might come
  in and find me there. As things are now between us, that would be distinctly
  awkward."</p>

  <p>"There is no chance of his finding you there," he assured her. "We all
  know that he is preparing for another expedition somewhere, and is scarcely
  ever in the house. The paper I want is a deposit note from the bank of his
  share certificates in Boothroyds. That, and a couple of sheets of notepaper
  with his address stamped on it and the envelopes to match, are all I need.
  You bring them, and we buy the jade necklace on Saturday morning before
  luncheon."</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly," she scoffed. "Charles may or may not be the fool you
  think him, but he doesn't leave documents like that lying about for any one
  to pick up. As a matter of fact, I can tell you exactly where he keeps all
  his bank papers, although it isn't very helpful. He has a small safe in his
  library. I know because I scolded him about it&mdash;told him it spoilt the
  atmosphere of the room."</p>

  <p>"That is unfortunate," De Brest reflected. "It is very unfortunate
  indeed."</p>

  <p>He sipped his champagne cocktail and he had the air of a worried and
  ill-used man.</p>

  <p>"Everything is so difficult for me lately," he complained. "It is always
  the fools, too, who make the greatest trouble. This young man Dutley, now,
  who could reckon upon such a thing? He is one of those who know that his
  business is ruined. All the others sell their shares. He not only holds his,
  but he buys more. He is utterly careless about nearly everything in life, yet
  he keeps documents of no real importance in a safe."</p>

  <p>"Charles can be very irritating when he tries," Lucille murmured
  sympathetically.</p>

  <p>He deliberated for several moments.</p>

  <p>"Will you do this for me then?" he asked. "Will you discover the name of
  the maker of the safe, and if possible, its number, and procure the notepaper
  and envelopes?"</p>

  <p>"I think I could promise that," she consented.</p>

  <p>"Would you do it to-morrow? There is no time to waste&mdash;not an
  hour."</p>

  <p>"He may be there himself to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"It is unlikely," De Brest insisted. "I know that he spends very little
  time in Curzon Street nowadays. Even if he were there, it might be
  possible."</p>

  <p>The music from the dance room became more compelling. He rose to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"It makes me happy, at any rate," he murmured, as he held out his hand to
  her, "to know that you are willing to help me. Shall we dance, yes?"</p>

  <p>She accepted his hand and rose to her feet. Her eyes sought his
  critically. All the time she was asking herself the eternal question
  concerning him. Never was she wholly satisfied.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE only letter which Dutley elected to open out of the
  thick budget which Burdett had brought from Curzon Street to Greenwall
  Avenue, was one addressed to him in Grace's handwriting from Smith's Hotel.
  He read the two or three lines scrawled across the sheet of notepaper with
  amazement:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">You might have told me, Charles. I shall be back in Leeds
  before you get this. You're a dear, but you might have told me. <span class=
  "smcap">Grace.</span></p><br>

  <p>He gazed dumbfounded at the enclosure&mdash;a torn scrap of thick
  parchment-like paper. There was not the slightest manner of doubt as to what
  it was. It was Sir Matthew's share of the receipt. He placed it carefully in
  his pocket-book, and rising to his feet, moved towards the telephone.
  Suddenly he stopped short, listening intently to the stealthy, approaching
  footsteps up the flagged walk of the back garden. There was the trifling
  delay occasioned apparently by the opening of the door. Then the footsteps
  drew nearer. Outside in the passage, they hesitated. There was a familiar
  shuffle.</p>

  <p>"Come in, Wolf," Dutley called out.</p>

  <p>The little man made a furtive entrance. Dutley, his eyes resting upon him
  curiously, waved him to a seat. Edward Wolf, by daylight, was hard to
  realise. His manner was more than ever secretive, the underlying fear in his
  eyes a more unpleasant thing. He was like a creature of the night, forced by
  some upheaval of nature to face the sunshine of day.</p>

  <p>"Well, Wolf, any news?" Dutley asked him.</p>

  <p>"There's always news where I go," was the half-whispered answer. "You
  ain't busy? I don't want to stay long here."</p>

  <p>Dutley resumed his chair. The dingy sitting room seemed more unattractive
  than ever as a ray of weak, glimmering sunshine stole through the window.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not busy," he said. "Go ahead!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know why I came," Wolf went on, folding and unfolding his hands.
  "I think I've took a fancy to you, sir. It isn't only your money. You've got
  to leave here, sir. You don't want to spend another night here. Last night I
  was with them that knows him," Wolf went on, jerking his head towards the
  window, "and I believe he's tumbled to you."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," Dutley speculated.</p>

  <p>"I don't say as they've tumbled to who you are, sir, or you'd have heard
  from them more particular before now, but they've got it that they're being
  watched from this house. Charles Dennis, you called yourself, working at a
  fruiterer's in Covent Garden. Some one's been to that fruiterer's and found
  out that there ain't such a person."</p>

  <p>"That sounds bad," Dutley admitted.</p>

  <p>"It sounds so bad, Guv'nor, that you want to get away. Don't spend another
  night here. It wouldn't be any good. Any one leaving here, back or front,
  would be spotted. You want to clear out and do it quick."</p>

  <p>"I had come to the same conclusion myself," Dutley acknowledged. "How did
  you happen to discover this?"</p>

  <p>"Not through going anywhere near him," the little man declared fervently.
  "I'm all the time flitting round. I've got nothing else to do in life. I just
  watches people for the pleasure of it. Sometimes I get paid; sometimes it
  leads to nothing. Never mind. I love watching. I don't make a bad living at
  it either," he meditated. "Not so bad as things are."</p>

  <p>"What do you do with your money?" Dutley enquired.</p>

  <p>"I buy all the magazines with crime and detective stories in," Wolf
  confided, "and I subscribes to a library where I gets every crime novel. I
  know 'em all, and lord, what bloomers some of them authors make! I could put
  'em right. Think they know the criminal world, some of them fellows! Why, if
  they knew it as I know it, their stories would make different reading.
  There's another thing I meant to tell you, Guv'nor."</p>

  <p>"Well."</p>

  <p>"That young Dutchman&mdash;the swell as is in with him over
  yonder&mdash;he's got a game on to-night or to-morrow night. He sent for a
  thug&mdash;bit of a safe opener, the cove he sent for. He'd got a man with
  him yesterday, too, an American I heard something about three years ago."</p>

  <p>"What did you hear?"</p>

  <p>"A bit too clever with the pen and ink," Wolf confided. "Sign your name so
  as you wouldn't know it from your own handwriting."</p>

  <p>The smile flickered across Dutley's face.</p>

  <p>"You're very interesting this afternoon, Edward Wolf," he observed. "I'm
  not a curious man as a rule, but I should like to know how you get hold of
  all this information."</p>

  <p>"I daresay you would," Mr. Wolf agreed, with a smirk of vanity. "It's
  taken me a good many years, but there I am now. I know which gangs are
  working and with whom. I know where every sort of thug is looked for and
  engaged. I know where the laggers lie hidden and I know where the worst of
  them go when there's trouble. There's more than once I could have brought a
  murderer to justice. It wasn't my job and I've never done it. I say, let the
  police do their own dirty work&mdash;but I know. I'll tell you something
  more, while I'm here, Guv'nor. There's trouble with that little gang you know
  of. They're pulling different ways and one of them's going to get his if he
  ain't careful, just like that poor clerk did."</p>

  <p>"You don't believe in that accident, then?"</p>

  <p>"Accident! Not likely!" Edward Wolf scoffed. "A town traveller of his
  wouldn't have no accident, and I tell you, I'm not blaming him yonder either.
  Huneybell would have squealed in another day. That's all, Guv'nor. I'll be
  getting along. I shall nip out of your back way and take a bus from
  Plaistow's corner. I don't like this avenue."</p>

  <p>Dutley produced some notes. The other whistled softly as he stowed them
  away.</p>

  <p>"You're worth working for, Guv'nor," he confided.</p>

  <p>"You're getting more and more useful to me," Dutley told him. "I'm
  interested in the man the gang are out with. If you hear anything more, get
  at me quickly."</p>

  <p>Edward Wolf looked a little doubtful.</p>

  <p>"I'll do what I can," he demurred, "but I ain't going to run no risks.
  I've given you the office, and that ought to be enough. I'll be on the job
  to-night, sir, but I'd rather you were anywhere else but here."</p>

  <p>"Last night," Dutley assured him. "Will that do for you?"</p>

  <p>"You'd be better away," Wolf persisted. "This place, with the low windows
  and rickety doors, is like a fly's parlour if he wanted to get at you."</p>

  <p>Dutley looked around and out of the window. The fugitive gleam of sunshine
  had passed, and there was something a little sinister in the grotesque
  outline of the ill-built, incongruous building opposite.</p>

  <p>"Tell you what I'll promise, Wolf," he said. "I shall stay here till one,
  in case I hear from you. After that, we'll lock up and clear out."</p>

  <p>"You're dead right," Wolf approved. "You do it, Mister. When I started to
  come up to see you this afternoon, the one thing in my mind was, get him away
  from Greenwall Avenue. It's a funny thing," he concluded, twirling his hat in
  his hand, "there ain't many people I take a fancy to, but I've got a kind of
  feeling about you. I expect I know why it is, too. It ain't your money. You
  have got what I ain't got. I can see it at the back of your eyes sometimes
  when you're talking. You've got courage, Mister&mdash;too much, I shouldn't
  wonder. Don't you let it muck things up for you."</p>

  <p>Mr. Edward Wolf took his departure. Dutley rang the bell, and Burdett made
  his prompt appearance.</p>

  <p>"Burdett," his master said, "I think we're due for clearing out of
  here."</p>

  <p>"I think we're over-due, sir," Burdett replied. "There's some one been
  fussing all round the place this afternoon. They've done something to the
  lock of the back gate, too&mdash;fixed it so that it didn't open. I've taken
  the whole thing off, and thrown it away."</p>

  <p>Dutley nodded.</p>

  <p>"I've made up my mind to go," he acknowledged. "They're on to us opposite,
  or they wouldn't have changed the place of the meeting the other night."</p>

  <p>Burdett fidgeted about uneasily.</p>

  <p>"What I'd like," he said earnestly, "is to see you march right out now. I
  took the liberty, sir, of walking round to the Highgate Arms half an hour
  ago, to see that the car was all right. I found William in a rare state. Both
  his front tyres were down, and it looked as though some one had been meddling
  with the valves."</p>

  <p>"The devil!" Dutley murmured. "What happened?"</p>

  <p>"I took off my coat and I helped him myself. He put new tyres on, and we
  brought the car round, and there it stands at the corner. My lord, you know
  what you once told me. You said I could smell an ambush, and I have done it
  more than once. There's a dirty lot prowling about that Highgate Arms. I had
  nothing to say to them and I pretended not to notice. We may have done a bit
  of good up here, sir, or we may not, but there's no more chance for us,
  because we're spotted. They are not far away, either, and they mean
  mischief."</p>

  <p>Dutley signified his acquiescence with a nod.</p>

  <p>"Burdett, I have seldom known you wrong, and we are for home, I don't want
  to go to Curzon Street till to-morrow anyway, but I can find somewhere else,
  and you can let Wolf know. We'll be off!"</p>

  <p>Dutley picked up the letters he had been writing and turned to join
  Burdett. Suddenly both men were aware of a strange phenomenon. There had been
  no sound of the opening or closing of any door, no summons of the bell, no
  audible footfall. Nevertheless, the door of the tawdry little sitting room
  was slowly being pushed open. Dutley, with the spring of a cat, was across
  the room, grasped the inside knob and flung the door open with his left hand,
  his gun flashing out in his right. There was a stifled, gurgling cry of
  terror. It was Wolf once more who stood upon the threshold, white as a sheet,
  perspiration on his forehead, and streaming down his face, his lips open, his
  limbs trembling.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Gawd!" he muttered. "Gawd!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOR the space of a few seconds, Edward Wolf was without a
  doubt in imminent danger. It was Dutley who swung Burdett round just as he
  was in the act of striking.</p>

  <p>"Can't you see he's only terrified," Dutley exclaimed. "Let him get his
  breath. Is there any one following you?"</p>

  <p>There appeared to be no one. The back door was still open, and the little
  strip of tiled pathway was empty.</p>

  <p>"You're all right, Wolf," Dutley continued encouragingly. "What's got you
  scared like this? No one's going to hurt you here. Hold up, man! Here,
  Burdett, give us some brandy."</p>

  <p>They poured stimulant from a bottle on the sideboard between his lips. He
  began to sob and speak broken words.</p>

  <p>"It's Tyke Harman, and two of his gang. They've got your chauffeur off the
  box. I expect they've&mdash;killed him by now."</p>

  <p>"Have they?" Dutley muttered. "Come on, Burdett!"</p>

  <p>He was down the tiled walk in half a dozen strides, through the wooden
  gate from which Burdett had removed the twisted lock, and at the end of the
  cobbled lane in a matter of seconds. The car was standing by the side of the
  road, a man in plain clothes upon the box leaning from the wheel towards the
  street. On the ground, Dutley's chauffeur, although a powerful fellow, was
  flat on his back, one man with his knee on his chest, another with his fist
  upraised. The sound of Dutley's flying footsteps made for a second a fixed
  tableau of the struggle. A second later, there was a little stab of flame,
  the singing of a bullet, and the man who had been about to deliver the blow
  swung round and round, holding his fist with his other hand. His companion
  staggered to his feet. A bullet spat between his legs. The two made for the
  palings on the opposite side of the road. The man on the box seat of the car
  leaped down and followed them. Dutley watched them, his revolver lowered.
  They clambered over the palings and dashed down under cover of a wall. It was
  a plot of land upon which streets were being laid out, and many small houses
  were in course of erection.</p>

  <p>"Are you hurt, William?" Dutley asked his chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"Nothing to speak of, my lord," the man answered, struggling to his feet.
  "Did they want the car, or what? They stabbed the tyres in the Highgate Arms
  there."</p>

  <p>"Can you drive?"</p>

  <p>"I think so, my lord. I can get as far as the next Police Station
  anyway."</p>

  <p>Dutley's eyes were still fixed upon the field.</p>

  <p>"Get inside," he ordered. "I'm not sure those fellows have done with us
  yet."</p>

  <p>"There were more of them up at the pub," Burdett cried. "I don't like the
  look of that car, my lord."</p>

  <p>It was a comparatively quiet thoroughfare, and apparently the only person
  who had seen anything of the struggle was a boy on a tricycle delivering
  bread, who was pedalling away as fast as he could. Another car had turned out
  from the pub and was coming down the hill at a great speed. Edward Wolf,
  shivering and trembling, had arrived on the pavement and was hanging on to
  Burdett. Dutley's voice rang out, crisp and commanding.</p>

  <p>"Into the car, both of you, with William!" he ordered. "Quick or there'll
  be more trouble!"</p>

  <p>They bundled in, and Dutley sprang into the driving seat. The engine was
  still running. He released the clutch, slipped in the gear, and they glided
  off in a slow, tantalising crawl. To the left, the three men, making a little
  circuit, were running up the rough field. Behind, he could see in the mirror,
  a touring car approaching in which two men were seated, leaning forward,
  their faces practically concealed by Homburg hats drawn low over their heads.
  From second to third speed, from third to fourth. Dutley shivered with joy as
  he felt the motor answer to the accelerator. He straightened himself, pushing
  the accelerator farther down and farther down with the healthy throb of the
  engine. A hundred yards in front was the main thoroughfare. Electric cars
  were clanking along. Omnibuses and taxicabs were honking. A
  policeman&mdash;the first&mdash;hove into sight and looked sternly at Dutley,
  who swept by.</p>

  <p>"All clear, my lord," Burdett shouted from behind. "They've given it up.
  Turned the car round and stopped for the other men. There's a Police Station
  a little way down on the left."</p>

  <p>Dutley swung into the thoroughfare and turned southwards. He drove on a
  hundred yards or so and stopped, but it was some distance past the Police
  Station.</p>

  <p>"How are you feeling, William?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Much better, my lord," the man answered.</p>

  <p>Dutley, glancing up and down the teeming street, noticed another policeman
  looking curiously at the car.</p>

  <p>"Come and drive then, if you can," he directed. "Never mind about the
  Police Station. We'll see to that later. Go on to the Midland Hotel."</p>

  <p>The man climbed into the driving seat. Burdett took the place by his side.
  Dutley sat in the back of the limousine with Edward Wolf, and Edward Wolf was
  in a very bad way indeed. Dark rims seemed to have formed under his eyes. The
  disease of fear was upon him.</p>

  <p>"Tyke Harman!" he muttered to himself. "He saw me too! They all saw me. I
  always told you, Guv'nor, I didn't want to have anything to do with you. I'm
  done now."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" Dutley scoffed. "Don't be so scared, man. I'll look after
  you."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing nobody can do," Edward Wolf persisted hopelessly. "It's
  no good my getting away. I'm Edward Wolf wherever I go to and I'll get mine
  in time. They're wrong, though, if they think I was spying on the gang. I
  never knew Tyke Harman was in it. If I had, I'm afraid I should have left you
  alone, Mister. He's a killer, that man. You had a shot at him, didn't you?
  Missed him, eh?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't miss," Dutley answered, smiling. "I didn't want any police
  trouble. I'm not even going to put in a complaint. I don't want to go near a
  Police Court for the next few days. I shot at his ugly fist, and I don't
  think you'll find that his knuckles will hurt any man again for some
  time."</p>

  <p>They pulled up under the portals of the Midland Hotel. Dutley stepped
  out.</p>

  <p>"You'll take the car back, William," he directed, "and you will oblige me
  by saying nothing about our little adventure."</p>

  <p>The man was plainly astonished. He was still a very unpresentable object,
  the peak of his cap broken, a smear of blood upon his face, his clothes caked
  with mud.</p>

  <p>"You mean you aren't going to the police, my lord?" he asked, in
  bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"Not for the moment, William. We know who those men were. Later on, we may
  do something. Just at present I don't wish a word said."</p>

  <p>The man touched his cap.</p>

  <p>"It is for your lordship to say. They meant doing me in if you hadn't come
  along. That shot of yours&mdash;I beg your pardon, my lord&mdash;it was a
  corker. I was done if you hadn't come."</p>

  <p>"We'll have our own back on them," Dutley promised cheerfully. "Burdett,
  you'd better go back to Curzon Street and bring me a change of linen and
  clothes here. I may as well have some decent things. I'm afraid the Greenwall
  Avenue stunt has come to an end."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't think of returning to Curzon Street, my lord?" Burdett
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"Not to-night. You and I know all about traps for wild beasts. You leave
  the gate open and you keep away. I'm keeping away from Curzon Street. Now,
  what about you, Edward Wolf? Would you like to be taken anywhere?"</p>

  <p>"In this automobile!" the man gasped. "Gawd, no! That would put the kibosh
  on it. I'm going to a shake-down I know, close here. I'll be on your job at
  Curzon Street at eleven o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Capital! All the difference is, then, here instead of Highgate. You'll
  find the telephone number in the book. I sha'n't stir out. Ring me up under
  the name of Charles Dennis."</p>

  <p>The car rolled off. Mr. Edward Wolf disappeared in his own quiet and
  mysterious fashion. Dutley passed a suspicious hall porter, and made his way
  to the reception office.</p>

  <p>"I should like a room, with a bath, for the night," he announced.</p>

  <p>The clerk scrutinised him doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Have you any luggage, sir?"</p>

  <p>"None at present. My servant will bring some later."</p>

  <p>The man looked Dutley up and down. His disguise as a fruiterer's clerk had
  been more than adequate.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, sir," he decided. "We're full up."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, you must have a room somewhere."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not, sir."</p>

  <p>"Look here," Dutley persisted, "it is necessary that I stop here to-night.
  My clothes are being sent here, and I'm expecting a telephone message. You
  know Sir Matthew Parkinson, don't you? I'm a friend of his."</p>

  <p>The young man's smile as he glanced away over Dutley's shoulder was almost
  insulting.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, sir," he said. "Well, here is Sir Matthew. If you are a friend of
  his, we shall be delighted to find you a room."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew strode into the office. He passed Dutley without recognising
  him. The clerk's smile became even more offensive.</p>

  <p>"You will pardon me, Sir Matthew," he begged, "but
  this&mdash;er&mdash;gentleman, has arrived without any luggage and wants a
  room. He says he is a friend of yours."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew swung round. He stared at Dutley for a moment, and suddenly
  recognised him.</p>

  <p>"My God, Dutley, is that you?" he exclaimed. "What on earth are you doing
  in that get-up?"</p>

  <p>"I've been in a scrap," Dutley explained. "Will you tell this unbelieving
  young gentleman that I am to have a room. My servant is bringing some clothes
  round presently."</p>

  <p>"A room!" Sir Matthew repeated incredulously. "Do you mean you want to
  stay here?"</p>

  <p>"You have guessed it," was the patient reply.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;what about your own house in Curzon Street?"</p>

  <p>"I want a room and a bath here," Dutley almost groaned, "with a sitting
  room if possible."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew turned to the clerk.</p>

  <p>"This is Lord Dutley," he announced. "Please see that he has everything he
  wants. I should give him the red suite next to mine."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I beg your pardon, my lord," the young man gasped. "I am sure I'm
  very sorry. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's all right," Dutley interrupted. "I look no end of a scallywag, I
  know. If you'll come upstairs with me, Sir Matthew," he added, turning
  around, "I think the time has very nearly arrived when we might have a bit of
  a chat."</p>

  <p>"This way, my lord," the clerk invited respectfully. "I will show you the
  rooms."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30">CHAPTER XXX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AMIDST the somewhat gloomy splendours of the red suite,
  Dutley contemplated for some time with profound distaste the almost tragic
  situation which had been forced upon him. Opposite him sat Sir Matthew, a
  little censorious, a little contemptuous, however grievously he may have been
  suffering inwardly from loss of self-esteem, still clinging with a sort of
  desperate bravery to the reputation in which he had lived and which he had
  enjoyed for years. Even now, his attitude towards Dutley was one of partial
  condescension.</p>

  <p>"Lucky I was downstairs, Dutley, when you arrived this evening," he
  remarked. "Why on earth were you trying to make yourself look like a tramp?
  No wonder they didn't want to give you a room."</p>

  <p>"I rather overdid the thing, I suppose," Dutley admitted. "You knew I'd
  taken on another adventure, didn't you? Home affair this time. I've been
  living up at Highgate under the name of Charles Dennis, clerk to a firm of
  fruit merchants, and this was the attire I thought went with the part."</p>

  <p>"What on earth were you doing that for?"</p>

  <p>Dutley threw his first bomb.</p>

  <p>"I was keeping an eye on Mr. Thomas Ryde and his associates," he said.</p>

  <p>"You were what?" Sir Matthew demanded.</p>

  <p>Dutley did not repeat himself.</p>

  <p>"You see, Sir Matthew," he explained, "directly you told me how serious
  the loss of the formula was, I went to have a chat with them at Scotland
  Yard. I saw their difficulty at once. It is part of their job, of course, to
  work for the recovery of any manner of stolen goods, but it is even more of
  their job to arrest the criminal. What I felt, and what they acknowledged,
  was that the moment the men who were in possession of the formula realised
  that they were in danger, the formula would be destroyed. That is why I
  thought I had better look round and see if there was any chance of getting
  the formula back myself."</p>

  <p>The world seemed falling away beneath the Yorkshireman's feet. He gripped
  the arms of his chair. A new man appeared to be seated opposite him in
  Dutley's likeness&mdash;a new man with the same voice, the same drawl, but
  something utterly unsuspected behind. It was the man who had apparently been
  born into a new self on the day of the meeting of the Directors of
  Boothroyds, Limited, who, amongst that assembly of men, older in years, and
  experience, had suddenly played the revolutionary, and had treated with
  good-humoured disdain the advice of a unanimous opposition.</p>

  <p>"I haven't done so badly," Dutley continued. "I know where the formula is,
  but then, after all, so do you."</p>

  <p>There was a queer, empty silence. Dutley had spoken in his usual tone of
  voice. There was nothing in his manner to indicate the fact that he was
  launching a terrible accusation against the other man.</p>

  <p>"I'm not very fond of talking," Dutley went on, "and it's tiresome having
  to repeat oneself. We'll leave it that I found out what I have found out. The
  formula lies in a safe of the International Safe Deposit Company, and the
  receipt for it is held jointly by five men. I have one share myself, which, I
  take it, Sir Matthew, formerly belonged to you. I've arrived at that stage in
  the proceedings now when I'm getting ready to become a collector of more
  scrap paper."</p>

  <p>In some curious fashion, the great Yorkshireman seemed to have fallen away
  in physique, to have shrunken in size almost co-relatively with the mortal
  blow which had been dealt to his pride. His cheeks seemed to have sagged, his
  eyes to have retreated. His backbone had temporarily gone.</p>

  <p>"Grace," he faltered&mdash;"she knew."</p>

  <p>"Nothing about you," Dutley reassured him. "Only about the formula."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew laughed bitterly. He lived again through that moment of agony
  when Grace's eyes had first met his, lit with the horror of knowledge.</p>

  <p>"You don't know what happened?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing except that Grace wrote me a mysterious note and said that
  she was going back to Leeds."</p>

  <p>"They're after me like wolves for my share of the receipt," Sir Matthew
  confided, "because I've put my foot down, because I've sworn that Glenaltons
  will never have the formula. I took it out of my pocket-book the other
  evening, when I was in her sitting room. Suddenly she gave a little cry. I
  looked up, and she was staring at it as though she had gone mad. I thought
  she was ill&mdash;I never dreamed that she knew. She took it away from me,
  for safety. The next morning she had gone."</p>

  <p>"Poor Grace!" Dutley murmured. "It's all right about the paper, Sir
  Matthew. I've got that."</p>

  <p>"You!"</p>

  <p>Dutley nodded.</p>

  <p>"She sent it to me. Just in an envelope, with scarcely a word. It's safe
  enough. Don't you worry. I've five more pieces to collect, and then we'll be
  humming along down at Marlingthorpe again."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew laughed, hardly, boisterously, mirthlessly.</p>

  <p>"You reckon you'll get the other five pieces, lad?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"I think so. I'm very lucky in some things. I got on the trail of this
  thing through sheer luck. I don't fancy Mr. Hartley Wright, or Doctor
  Hisedale, ought to be impossible to deal with. Thomas Ryde will be my only
  trouble. I suppose he has two pieces&mdash;his own and the piece of the man
  he murdered."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew was past emotion. His shiver was purely physical.</p>

  <p>"You mean Huneybell?"</p>

  <p>"Of course Huneybell was asking for it," Dutley acquiesced, "living in
  association with a man like Thomas Ryde. Ryde knew that sooner or later
  Huneybell would give away the show if he were left alone. His behaviour was
  perfectly logical, even if a little merciless."</p>

  <p>"And will you tell me how, lad," Sir Matthew asked, "you think you're
  going to tackle Thomas Ryde? With what you've found out, you could have the
  law on us&mdash;jail for the lot of us any moment&mdash;but you wouldn't get
  the formula."</p>

  <p>"That's been the difficulty all along," Dutley conceded amiably. "And
  don't associate yourself, Sir Matthew, with that gang. You see, on the night
  of the burglary, by the grace of Providence, you were speaking at the
  Mercers' Dinner in the City."</p>

  <p>"Thank God you know that!"</p>

  <p>"I know that, and I know who dragged you into the small share you had in
  the affair," Dutley went on. "I was going to have a serious talk with you
  about that fellow De Brest within the next few days. How much have you paid
  on account of the Dulkopf Iron Company?"</p>

  <p>"Eighty thousand pounds," Sir Matthew groaned, "and he's at me for another
  fifty. I've lost all the brass I had in the world with that young man."</p>

  <p>"If he turns out to be solvent, you'll get every penny of it," Dutley
  assured him. "I've had an accountant in Amsterdam for the past fortnight
  looking into that young man's affairs. He's made a lot of money now and then,
  but it's been for himself, and not his clients. It was to get your money
  back, of course, that De Brest inveigled you into this."</p>

  <p>"I hadn't a shilling in the world left," Sir Matthew confessed. "First of
  all, I was to have had a sixth share of what they got for the formula if I
  helped them a little towards the burglary. I let them have the keys of the
  offices and I arranged that the formula should be in that safe. There was
  absolutely nothing else that I did. I was to have had a million, according to
  De Brest, and harken, Charles Dutley, I knew right well that Rentoul knew
  that formula backwards. He could have made the stuff without the slightest
  trouble. What was I giving away? Our formula, without a doubt, which is worth
  a good deal to a competitor, but it would take any one in the world three
  years to catch us up, and I never let on that we should be manufacturing just
  as well as ever. That's how I figured it out&mdash;a million for me, and
  damned little loss for any one. I reckoned without Thomas Ryde. He tumbled to
  it. He made sort of friends with Rentoul. That night, Rentoul had a note that
  something was going on at the Works. He thought one of the stills in the
  laboratory was wrong. He came down, and Ryde made sure of him. They took the
  note away out of his pocket."</p>

  <p>"Really," Dutley murmured, with a suggestion of something that was almost
  admiration in his tone, "I think they'll put Thomas Ryde in Madame
  Tussaud's!..."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew was rather like a drugged man, struggling back into sanity, a
  new world and a new light.</p>

  <p>"That telephone message?" he asked presently.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I sent that," Dutley admitted. "I thought it just as well for you to
  know where the formula was going."</p>

  <p>"Then it was you behind the newspaper in the corner when I marched out,"
  Sir Matthew declared triumphantly. "I could have sworn it was your voice
  asking for a mutton pie, only you put me off with all that rubbish."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was I," Dutley assented. "I was afraid I might have got you into
  trouble, but I felt pretty certain that Thomas Ryde was too clever to risk a
  shindy there if any one else was about. How did your pal De Brest explain
  matters? He was there, wasn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he swore that they were only trying it on. All that they meant was to
  make me unconscious with a blasted hypodermic needle, and I suppose they'd
  have searched me for the receipt for the formula, which, as a matter of fact,
  I hadn't got. They looked a bit uglier than that, though. I could have
  laughed when I heard your drawl out there, ordering a mutton pie a few feet
  away from where they were going to lay me out. How they ever drifted
  together, that little gang, I can't imagine. They've got no conscience, but,
  except for Thomas Ryde and Hisedale, they've got no courage either. They go
  halfway and then they get the shivers. They let me walk through them as
  though they were putty after they'd heard your voice."</p>

  <p>Dutley nodded.</p>

  <p>"Amateurish, all of them&mdash;except Thomas Ryde," he agreed. "I suppose
  it had to be like that. They wanted a financier, they wanted a chemist, they
  wanted an American safe opener. Where Huneybell came in I don't quite
  understand. He's out of it now, anyway, poor chap! They're losing their
  balance. Getting in outside help to do the dirty work, and that's always
  dangerous for any one in their position. They gave me a little sport this
  afternoon. Now let me see."</p>

  <p>He produced a small diary from his pocket and studied it.</p>

  <p>"To-day," he meditated, "is Wednesday. Friday is settlement day here and
  on the Continent. I expect I shall hear from De Brest before then. We'll wipe
  him off the slate. That leaves Hartley Wright, Hisedale and Thomas Ryde.
  Hisedale one might deal with differently. Thomas Ryde may need him, and
  therefore Hisedale may remain, but do you know, Sir Matthew, I positively
  cannot see Ryde allowing a man like Hartley Wright, who really has been the
  most useless of the survivors of the gang, to touch that two hundred thousand
  pounds. I shouldn't be at all surprised if Ryde saved me some trouble with
  Hartley Wright. That would mean three shares of the receipt with him. That
  would leave only Hisedale to be dealt with&mdash;Sir Matthew, do you know
  what I should do if I were you?"</p>

  <p>"Jump into the Thames, I should think," was the gloomy response.</p>

  <p>"I should do nothing of the sort," Dutley said cheerfully. "Things aren't
  looking badly for us at all. You've made a great mistake, Sir Matthew, if
  you'll allow a younger man to say so, but the cleverest men of business in
  the world have always been duped by the Sigismund de Brest type of shark. As
  regards the conspiracy itself, you've had very little to do with it. You're
  not in any way responsible for what happened to poor old Rentoul, and except
  for this year's bad trading, the burglary isn't going to do us any harm. The
  formula," Dutley concluded, with a queer, hard light in his blue eyes, "is
  either coming back to Boothroyds, or going to vanish from the face of the
  earth. Don't feel too desperate about it all, Sir Matthew. Things haven't
  gone too far. I've felt sure of that all along. That's why I wouldn't sign
  that statement. I don't care a damn about the investing public, or the Stock
  Exchange. What I propose is to address the shareholders direct. I had to put
  Wendell Cooke off yesterday, but I'm drafting a short circular letter, which
  I am sending to him to-night. I am just going to explain that, owing to the
  tragic death of our chief chemist, serious disorganisation ensued in the
  factory which has resulted in the manufacture of a considerable amount of
  unsatisfactory material. The difficulty, however, is only temporary, and the
  Directors are convinced that in a very short time everything will be as
  usual. I shall go so far as to say that it is the considered opinion of us
  all that the fall in the price of the shares is utterly out of proportion to
  the losses sustained."</p>

  <p>"I hope to God you are right, young man," Sir Matthew prayed. "You seem to
  have suddenly acquired the knack of seeing things right somehow. I agree, of
  course."</p>

  <p>"Lucky I had a bit of cash put on one side," Dutley remarked. "I was able
  to go in and buy, and that's what's upset De Brest's apple cart. Now we come
  to the point I was going to make. What were you thinking of doing with
  yourself for the next few days, Sir Matthew?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," was the dejected reply.</p>

  <p>"Then, let me make a suggestion," Dutley begged. "Go back to Leeds.
  They'll give you no peace here. They'll think you still have your portion of
  the receipt and you'll be in danger all the time. Put a bit of pep into them
  at the Works. Drop them a hint down at the laboratories that the formula may
  be back in a few days, and&mdash;don't discharge any more workpeople."</p>

  <p>"How the hell do you think you are going to get the formula back again?"
  Sir Matthew demanded doggedly.</p>

  <p>"Fight for it, very likely. We may cheat them after all with the law.
  Steal it, if necessary. Wangle it away somehow. By-the-by," Dutley continued,
  stretching out his hand and drawing a time-table towards him, "there is a
  good train at seven&mdash;dining car&mdash;ten thirty- five&mdash;Leeds."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew rose to his feet. He had the air of a man still in great
  confusion of spirit.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand all this," he admitted. "I can't get used to it.
  Except that there are flashes of your father about you now and then, I should
  have thought that I was dreaming."</p>

  <p>Dutley laughed as he pushed him towards the door.</p>

  <p>"You go and catch your train, Sir Matthew," he advised. "Tell Grace that
  everything's going to be all right and she'll hear from me in a day or
  two."</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew walked down the corridor, entered his room, and ordered his
  bag to be packed, like a man in a dream. It was not until he had taken his
  place in the dining car of the Scotch Express, and found himself surrounded
  by a little crowd of obsequious attendants, that he fully awoke from his
  dazed condition.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch31"
     name="ch31">CHAPTER XXXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"MISTER!"</p>

  <p>"Well?" Dutley answered, sitting up in bed and grasping the receiver of
  the telephone a little tighter. "Dutley speaking. Go ahead!"</p>

  <p>"They're in. Two of them, if not three. Used a latchkey, and walked in,
  bold as brass, quarter of an hour ago."</p>

  <p>"Is Thomas Ryde one of them?" Dutley asked, already halfway out of
  bed.</p>

  <p>"He is not, or I don't know that I should be here at the telephone," was
  the emphatic reply. "Do I do anything about the cops?"</p>

  <p>"Not a thing. Your job's over for the night."</p>

  <p>It took Dutley barely ten minutes to struggle into his old clothes, make
  his way downstairs, and out into the street. Three o'clock was striking as he
  hailed a stray taxi and was driven away southwards. The grey, murky sky was
  besprinkled with masses of floating clouds, through which shone an occasional
  star. The pavements were wet, but no rain was falling. At the corner of Queen
  Street, Dutley descended and paid off his cab. The neighbourhood to him
  seemed to have a singularly deserted appearance. Any festivities there may
  have been in the vicinity had ceased. The taxicab stand was empty. Even the
  customary policeman at the corner of Clarges Street had disappeared. Dutley
  crossed the road, latchkey in hand, walked a dozen yards along the pavement,
  paused and quietly opened his own front door. He closed it noiselessly and
  stood listening. From the reflection upon the oak floor, he could see that
  there was a light in his study, and the joy of the chase thrilled in his
  blood. He was alert, tense in every fibre of his being. Not only was the
  light shining there very distinctly, but there was the sound of movement
  within the room, a muffled voice. Adventure, after all, was not to be denied
  to him! He lingered for a moment, his revolver in his hand, and, his mind
  working quickly, he ran over the resources of the household. There was Mrs.
  Bulwell, the cook, and her niece who acted as kitchen-maid, in one
  room&mdash;excellent servants, but negligible in the present crisis. There
  were two housemaids&mdash;fresh importations during his absence, whose names
  he failed to remember&mdash;also negligible. Then there was Kassim, the
  Abyssinian, a terrible fellow, strong as an ox, amazing in a scrap, but
  absolutely gun-shy. He had never let off a firearm in his life, and at the
  very sight of the smallest of revolvers became a coward. Burdett he had
  purposefully left at St. Pancras. Robert, the footman, would be upstairs,
  sleeping in his bed, and possibly a <i>confr&egrave;re</i>, whose duties
  consisted chiefly in looking after the electric light, the boots and the ice
  machine. This was the entire staff. Kassim, if summoned, might have a good
  effect, but if a gun were even so much as pointed at him he would flee,
  howling. Dutley's instantaneous review of the resources of his household,
  therefore, made it clear to him that any help he might need in dealing with
  these intruders must come from outside.</p>

  <p>He leaned down and listened at the keyhole, remaining there for several
  moments. He could distinctly hear the sound of papers being turned over at
  his table inside. His fingers tightened upon the handle of that very deadly
  little weapon which he was carrying. The moment had arrived! He straightened
  himself, swung the door open with his left hand, and his right shot out.</p>

  <p>"Stay where you are!" he ordered sharply. "Up with your hands! Put them
  up, quick! You there&mdash;up!"</p>

  <p>There were two men in the room&mdash;one seated at the writing table, and
  the other, on his left, bending over a small safe, the door of which stood
  open. The former raised his hands at once. The latter paused for a moment to
  rearrange his black silk mask. A bullet whistled within a foot of his head,
  showering him with splinters of wood from the corner of the bookcase. After
  that, his hands shot up.</p>

  <p>"Capital!" Dutley approved. "I like you both better that way. You can
  perhaps guess who I am. I have the reputation of being the biggest fool, but
  the quickest shot, in London. May I enquire into the nature of your curiosity
  as to my poor belongings?"</p>

  <p>"Say, don't you try that Raffles swank," the man at the desk growled.
  "We're not here to tell you fairy tales anyway."</p>

  <p>"I'm properly rebuked," Dutley admitted. "Stand up, my friend at the desk
  ... Yes, I thought so. There is a bulge about that pocket which does not
  please me. Stay as you are and lower your hands if you want to be measured
  for a coffin."</p>

  <p>Dutley crossed the room unhurriedly. He stood within a foot of the man who
  had been searching his desk, looked over his shoulder at the scraps of
  writing on the blotting pad, and suddenly jammed his revolver into the man's
  side.</p>

  <p>"No use, you see," he explained sharply. "I'm not an amateur at this job.
  Keep your hands up, or you're a dead man&mdash;Good! A very nice little
  weapon too."</p>

  <p>He drew from the man's hip pocket a small, flat automatic of the latest
  type and threw it to the farther end of the room. His hands travelled lightly
  over his person. Afterwards, he backed away satisfied.</p>

  <p>"You can sit down if you like," he said, "while I deal with your
  friend."</p>

  <p>"Quick as you can, Guv'nor," the safe breaker begged. "My arms is getting
  stiff."</p>

  <p>"A professional, I see," Dutley remarked, glancing at the tools upon the
  floor.</p>

  <p>"Don't need to be no professional to open a child's money-box like this,"
  the man grunted. "If that cove who calls hisself my pal had been as quick
  about his job as I have with mine, it'd have been home and Mother long before
  you come in. Here, my gun's in my coat pocket. Take it, and have done with
  it. I'd have you notice, Guv'nor, in case we're pinched, that it ain't
  loaded."</p>

  <p>Dutley glanced at the breach and nodded. He threw it also, however, to the
  far end of the room. Suddenly, with a catlike spring, he swung around and
  pounced upon the other man, catching his hand as it travelled down his
  trouser leg.</p>

  <p>"A transatlantic trick, this," Dutley observed, as he snatched the small,
  narrow gun from the man's boot. "I wonder why I felt sure that you had
  something tucked away. With that mask, one hasn't a chance to watch the
  working of your ingenuous countenance."</p>

  <p>"Blast you, shut up!" the despoiled man muttered. "You scored the odd
  trick. Now, what about it?"</p>

  <p>"Look here, Guv'nor," the safe breaker interposed, "I was told this
  weren't no professional affair at all&mdash;just a friendly look-through a
  chum's love letters. There wasn't a bean in the safe. I can answer for that.
  We're copped, but there isn't a bob's worth of swag. What about a walk into
  the still night for yours truly?"</p>

  <p>"The suggestion," Dutley confessed, "is not unreasonable. Still, I shall
  ask you to wait just for a few minutes whilst I try to get to the bottom of
  this curious visitation. Who engaged you, Mr. Bill Sykes&mdash;if that should
  happen to be your name&mdash;to pay me this early morning call?"</p>

  <p>"Him," the other replied, jerking his thumb towards the man at the desk.
  "Fifty quid, I've had, and fifty more I was to have. So far, the money's
  worth the job. A child could have opened this with a toothpick. I could have
  done it myself with my thumb nail and here I've lugged tools enough along to
  open a number one Armstrong."</p>

  <p>"My sympathies are entirely with you," Dutley announced. "Presently, I
  hope that I may be in a position to offer you a little refreshment. In the
  meantime, pray pack up your outfit, unless you like to leave those
  delicate-looking files behind as a memento of your visit."</p>

  <p>"You take this joker on, Guv'nor," the safe breaker begged, turning to his
  companion. "His lip gives me the stomach ache."</p>

  <p>Dutley, always on his guard, also turned towards the man at the desk.</p>

  <p>"Our friend's suggestion is excellent," he agreed, "although I regret that
  I have failed to interest him. Perhaps, sir, you would be kind enough to tell
  me what you are doing copying my autograph and for what purpose you have
  hired your companion to break into my safe. What are you searching for?"</p>

  <p>"A recipe for boot polish," the other sneered.</p>

  <p>Dutley reached out his hand towards the telephone instrument, which stood
  upon a bookcase, and placed it upon a small table by the side of which he
  seated himself. His left hand played with the receiver; his right gripped
  always the butt of his revolver. Those pale blue eyes of his were ceaselessly
  and brilliantly alert.</p>

  <p>"We have still an hour or so before dawn at our disposal," he remarked.
  "You, I should imagine, are more pressed for time than I am. Listen, my
  friend at the desk, can't we hurry things up? Do I need to be more
  convincing? Let's put it like this. You're trapped. Your little scheme,
  whatever it may be, is busted up. You will not leave this house with any
  article of my property in your possession. You have one faint chance of
  escape from the arms of the law, and that is to answer my questions
  intelligently and convincingly. I have a habit of recognising the truth when
  I hear it. A single falsehood, and it's the nearest Police Station on the
  phone. Now, listen, please. What the devil are you looking for?"</p>

  <p>"We are looking," the man at the desk confided, "for the Safe Custody
  Receipt of a few hundred thousand one-pound ordinary shares in the firm of
  Boothroyds, Limited, the certificates for which, at the present moment, are
  deposited at the head office of Barclays Bank."</p>

  <p>"You are singularly well informed," Dutley acknowledged, "but you pique my
  curiosity still further. A Safe Deposit Receipt for shares&mdash;even the
  shares themselves&mdash;is not a negotiable security. Why, therefore, this
  risk?"</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," the man at the desk argued, "that we are running any
  particular risk. I guess we're not here to steal anything. We're not
  thieves."</p>

  <p>"The devil you aren't!" Dutley observed. "What are you then? Afternoon
  callers, dropped in for a late cup of tea&mdash;one of you, by-the-by, with a
  gun in his boot, and the other with a complete set of safe-breaking
  implements? It won't do, Mr. Hartley Wright. You may as well take that mask
  off. It must be very hot, and with a voice like yours it's singularly
  ineffectual. Now, tell me exactly how much the Baron de Brest is paying you
  for this little job, and how you found your way in? You seem to be trying to
  spin things out. You haven't much to gain by that, have you?"</p>

  <p>Even as the words passed his lips, Dutley realised that for some reason or
  other that was precisely what his <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> was trying to do.
  All the time, the man at the desk sat and spoke tensely. His usual briskness
  had left him. He had the air of a man listening, expecting. Dutley responded
  promptly to his instinct. He rose to his feet and permitted himself a swift
  glance around the room. There was certainly no one else there, nor any place
  of concealment. Could it be from outside that they were expecting help? In
  the street, that long, breathless silence before dawn reigned. Only one taxi
  had passed during the last few minutes. There was not even a footfall upon
  the pavement. Dutley re-seated himself in his chair, but whilst he listened
  to the other man's speech, he listened, too, for other things.</p>

  <p>"You can call this a hold-up, if you like," Hartley Wright said. "Some
  sloppy job, I call it! No one wants your b&mdash;&mdash;y Boothroyd shares
  for keeps that I can see. What I've done is to write an order on your bankers
  to sell at opening hours to-morrow a hundred thousand of your shares at
  ruling prices, and to place the proceeds&mdash;do you get me, Dutley&mdash;to
  the credit of your account. It's no good doing that unless we hand across the
  Safe Custody Receipt for the shares at the same time. That's where my friend
  with the small black bag comes along."</p>

  <p>"I begin to see daylight," Dutley confessed. "Still, whilst we're engaged
  upon this friendly conference, I should like you to tell me exactly what good
  it is going to do De Brest to have me sell, say a hundred thousand shares of
  my stock, at considerably less than their value?"</p>

  <p>"Say, you make me tired!" Mr. Hartley Wright exclaimed. "I don't know how
  much of a mutt you are, but Boothroyd shares to-day are dirt. They can't make
  the stuff any longer. There's a little pool of men who got in the know who've
  been selling the shares. I'm one of them. Perhaps we've been a bit too eager.
  It wouldn't have mattered, but some half-witted mug has given out a big
  buying order, and my friends have sold a few more shares, especially abroad,
  than they can deliver. Have you got that?"</p>

  <p>"Even to my mediocre intelligence," Dutley admitted, "you have made the
  matter clear."</p>

  <p>"Then I guess we're through. Any objection to my stretching my legs? A
  mouthful of fresh air wouldn't be too bad."</p>

  <p>"Just a moment," Dutley begged. "Supposing you had succeeded in getting
  away from here to-night with the Safe Deposit Receipt for my shares, and my
  forged order to sell at ten o'clock, which I presume could not have been
  recalled, would it, by chance, be my friend the Baron Sigismund de Brest who
  is running your pool, and who would be relieved from an embarrassing
  position?"</p>

  <p>"Over on the other side," Mr. Hartley Wright said deliberately, "we don't
  reckon it's playing the game to give even our suckers away. No names,
  Dutley."</p>

  <p>"Look here, can't you finish with this lip business?" the other man broke
  in. "I'm sick of sitting here listening to all this splother. Are we for the
  jug, or aren't we? What's your game, Guv'nor?"</p>

  <p>"My game," Dutley began?</p>

  <p>And then he knew what Mr. Hartley Wright had been waiting and hoping for.
  The door behind him creaked as it was pushed open. There was the ghost of a
  footfall following. Dutley sprang to his feet, but no human effort would have
  been of any avail. A pair of strong arms were already thrown around his neck
  from behind. His gun clattered to the ground. He was held as though in a
  vise. Hartley Wright rose to his feet, with a cruel smile upon his lips.</p>

  <p>"We have stood enough of your b&mdash;&mdash;y, sneering talk," he jeered.
  "You're going to get something now which will keep you quiet for a time."</p>

  <p>Dutley struggled fiercely, but the grip from behind was like a band of
  iron around his throat. The safe breaker, with a cold, ugly smile, was
  engaged in what seemed to be a deliberate attempt to break his right arm.
  Hartley Wright, with a wicked grin of triumph parting his lips, was hovering
  around with a heavy paper weight in his hand, seeking for the most vulnerable
  spot in which to deliver the decisive blow. Even to Dutley's swooning
  consciousness, the position seemed hopeless. And then
  suddenly&mdash;pandemonium!</p>

  <p>It was more than pandemonium. It was hysteria&mdash;the terror of men
  facing something worse than death. They leaped away from him without coherent
  speech. Hartley Wright was making queer noises in his throat, crouching
  against the table, as though unable to support himself. The safe breaker was
  standing with his fingers pawing the empty air. The third man had sprung
  towards the window and was staggering there, clutching the curtain. The cry
  which had startled them all rang through the house as Dutley had heard it
  upon the hot desert, himself crouched in ambush, his rifle sighted, knowing
  full well that nothing but chance was between him and fearsome sudden death.
  It rang down the broad stairway of the little house in Mayfair, gruesomely
  incongruous, shrill and terrifying at first, like the threatening of a
  screaming, demented being. It ended with a deep roar of passion, and the
  three men to whom that sound was a strange thing were paralysed and nerveless
  with fear of what might be at hand. Then Kassim, with his tribal battle cry
  still frothing upon his lips, leaped into the room, waving a wooden club
  above his head, like some savage animal, into whom devils had entered. He
  brought with him a suggestion of hot sands and foul jungles, of desolate
  countries where the death of man meant no more than the crushing of an insect
  upon the pavement. There was a crash of glass as the safe breaker, nearly
  delirious, went through the window, followed by his mate; a groan and a flop
  as Hartley Wright, sobbing through sheer agony of fear, rolled over on the
  ground, caught by the first fierce blow of that hideous-looking weapon. The
  cool wind streamed into the room through the broken window. They heard the
  flying footsteps in the street. Kassim snarled angrily.</p>

  <p>"White master hurt?"</p>

  <p>"Not I," Dutley gasped, rapidly recovering. "God, how you scared
  them!"</p>

  <p>He staggered to his feet. There was a heavy tramping outside, the ringing
  of bells, a banging at the door.</p>

  <p>"The Police, Kassim! Let them in," his master ordered. "One moment!"</p>

  <p>He stooped down and committed the first theft of his life.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch32"
     name="ch32">CHAPTER XXXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DUTLEY, a personable figure in his well-cut, dark overcoat,
  the usual out-of-season bunch of violets in his buttonhole, bowler hat, a
  cane under his arm, and a general air of being at peace with the world,
  strolled into Bond Street just before one o'clock on the following morning
  with the idea of having a cocktail at the Embassy before keeping a luncheon
  engagement. Threading his way through a little crowd at the entrance, he came
  face to face with Lucille and her brother. They halted involuntarily.</p>

  <p>"How goes the family feud?" Dutley enquired, ignoring Lucille's start and
  obvious embarrassment. "Am I allowed to wish you both a good morning, and to
  comment upon the springlike quality in the air?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be an ass, Charles," Lucille enjoined. "There's no family feud, so
  far as I'm concerned. What's all this about a burglary in your house last
  night?"</p>

  <p>"It is a long story. I could tell it to you better sitting down."</p>

  <p>"What about a dry one, with a dash?" Ronnie suggested.</p>

  <p>"The idea appeals to me," Dutley confessed. "I always find the atmosphere
  of a Magistrate's Court depressing, although my presence there this morning
  was only a matter of form."</p>

  <p>"We must hear about that," Lucille insisted. "The papers are most
  intriguing. And what are you doing in London at all? We all thought that you
  were so bored with things that you were off on another expedition or
  something."</p>

  <p>"I had some idea of it," Dutley admitted, as they turned up the broad
  entrance to the Embassy. "London seems to me just now, though, to be equally
  full of adventure. Last night I strolled home at a perfectly reasonable
  hour&mdash;about three o'clock in the morning, I think it was&mdash;let
  myself in with my latchkey, and, because my locks are well oiled, and I had
  those rubber things on the soles of my shoes, I marched into my study to find
  two total strangers making themselves at home there."</p>

  <p>They descended the stairs. Dutley ignored the breathless interest of his
  two auditors and waited until he had found a corner, and ordered cocktails,
  before he continued.</p>

  <p>"The whole affair," he recounted, "up to a certain point was conducted in
  a very gentlemanly manner. The safe-breaker, who had finished his job, was
  packing up ready to leave, and his companion, whose imitations of my
  signature were really wonderful, except that I understand now he was a
  professional, assured me almost pathetically that they had no wish to rob me.
  They required a very informal document connected with the deposit of some
  shares of mine in the bank which appears to me, even now, to be of the
  slightest possible consequence. In the course of the proceedings, however, an
  associate of the safe-breaker, who had been searching my room upstairs,
  arrived, and the atmosphere became less friendly. Here's luck!"</p>

  <p>He drank half his cocktail and nodded appreciatively to the watching
  barman.</p>

  <p>"You're a great artist, Alfred," he acknowledged. "Let me see, where was
  I?"</p>

  <p>"Did you recognise either of the burglars?" Ronnie asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Can't say that I did exactly. One was an American, I feel sure, and I
  fancy that I should know him again if I saw him."</p>

  <p>"What happened after the third man came?" Lucille demanded.</p>

  <p>"Well, as I was saying, the whole atmosphere was changed. Suggestions of
  personal violence even were made, and, in short, it looked as though we were
  in for a real hullabaloo. Then there happened something which I would have
  given the world for you two to have seen. It was the most amazing sixty
  seconds I have ever spent in my life ... Alfred, another cocktail."</p>

  <p>"Oh, do go on," Lucille begged impatiently. "What happened?"</p>

  <p>"Kassim happened. Never did I dream when that Abyssinian went down on his
  knees to me in the streets of Bagdad and I had to bring him home with me
  whether I wanted to or not, that he would have provided me with those few
  seconds of undiluted joy. It was like nothing on earth. Cinemas have
  attempted the same sort of thing, but in a milk-and-water kind of way."</p>

  <p>He paused to light a cigarette, and Lucille shook his arm.</p>

  <p>"Don't keep on stopping in that irritating fashion," she implored. "Go on
  at once, please."</p>

  <p>"Well, in the midst of our slight arguments," Dutley continued, shutting
  up his lighter with a click, "came the most blood-curdling noise man has ever
  conceived&mdash;the battle cry of the Tangias, one of the Abyssinian border
  tribes, from which Kassim came. I can assure you that when he descended my
  stairs like a whirlwind, bellowing his terrible song, which they say no
  European has ever heard without a shiver, and waving his club, I don't
  believe a regiment of Life Guards would have held their ranks for a moment.
  They would have done what my visitors did. Two of them went through the
  window&mdash;one after the other&mdash;and from the last I saw of them I
  should think they are still running. The third was too terrified to move, and
  Kassim caught him just a flick on the side of the head. He's lying in
  hospital now, and they say he'll be lucky if he recovers consciousness in a
  week. Then of course the police arrived. There were notebooks and questions,
  searches for clues, and all sorts of things."</p>

  <p>"What about the two fellows who got away through the window?" Ronnie
  asked.</p>

  <p>"They made a clean bolt of it. Must have had a car waiting round the
  corner, I should think."</p>

  <p>"Haven't there been any arrests at all, then?" Lucille asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, they've got the poor chap Kassim flicked. Whether he'll ever appear
  in Court or not depends upon the thickness of his skull."</p>

  <p>"Did the other two get away with what they were after?" Ronnie enquired
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Not they, because it wasn't there. I hired one of those vaults in a Safe
  Deposit Company the other day and shoved nearly all my important documents in
  there. Must have been a bit disappointing," he went on. "They had got the
  whole thing worked out jolly well. I've never seen any forged work before,
  but I take off my hat to that fellow. He left a letter on my table to the
  bank, instructing them to sell my Boothroyds, signed with my name, which I
  should never have hesitated about for a moment. Perfectly marvellous piece of
  work! If that had been handed across the counter at ten o'clock this morning
  with the receipt for the shares enclosed, there'd have been a nasty glut of
  Boothroyds on the market by this time."</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure about that," Ronnie rejoined, "That buying order of yours
  that the Governor's so crazy about is playing hell with the whole
  market."</p>

  <p>"What's our price this morning?" Dutley queried.</p>

  <p>"Nominal sixty, but there are no dealings. There's been a big 'bear' of
  the shares, as you know, Charles&mdash;more abroad than here&mdash;and with
  this buying order out no one can get the scrip. It's going to give us all
  hell next week."</p>

  <p>"Like to do me a favour, Ronnie?" Dutley begged, a little abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course."</p>

  <p>"Go and take the air for five minutes. I don't know when I shall have an
  opportunity of talking to Lucille again and I'd like to have just a word or
  two with her."</p>

  <p>The young man rose reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"I can't stay away very long," he remarked. "We're lunching here
  presently."</p>

  <p>He strolled out, and Dutley turned to his companion.</p>

  <p>"Lucille," he said, "I got your letter. That's all right. We're not
  engaged any longer. Still, what was it all about?"</p>

  <p>She moved a little restlessly in her place.</p>

  <p>"Charles," she explained, "I do think that for a young man you waste your
  time terribly. You won't take an interest in your business, you go off on
  these silly expeditions which lead to nothing, and you do seem to
  me&mdash;you'll forgive me, won't you&mdash;so helpless when anything of a
  crisis comes along like just now. Father said that you were simply terrible
  at the Boothroyd meeting. You're a very amusing companion for an hour, or
  even a little longer, but amusement isn't everything. You won't take life
  seriously. That's the whole trouble. I like some one who's in touch with
  things that count&mdash;you're a great dear, Charles, and I shall always be
  very fond of you, but that's all."</p>

  <p>Dutley tapped a cigarette deliberately upon the table and lit it.</p>

  <p>"Lucille, my dear," he said, "I have already accepted my dismissal. I do
  honestly believe that it is for the best. Wipe that off the map, but you've
  got to listen to me for a moment, even if it makes you angry."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Don't marry Sigismund de Brest."</p>

  <p>"What makes you think I should be likely to?" she asked, a little
  evasively,</p>

  <p>"That doesn't matter. I know that for some mysterious reason he appeals to
  you. I've watched you together the few times we've met. He has introduced you
  to his relatives. He has interested you in his schemes. You are probably
  lunching with him to-day."</p>

  <p>"I am," she admitted defiantly.</p>

  <p>Those blue eyes of Dutley's wandered away. He spoke very gently, but there
  was a certain force underneath his words.</p>

  <p>"I don't criticise people often," he said. "It's very seldom I have
  anything to say against any one who's not present. I don't like De Brest and
  I think that if you marry him you will regret it for the rest of your
  life."</p>

  <p>"That's just prejudice," she declared.</p>

  <p>"It may be," he answered, as he rose to make his <i>adieux</i>, "but I
  know a bit too."</p>

  <p>He picked up the few inches of exquisite cambric with which she had been
  toying and held it to his nostrils.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful perfume," he meditated. "Reminds me of a Persian rose garden
  when those other long, yellow flowers are out. You have the sachets too,
  haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"You ought to know," she replied, smiling at him with uplifted eyebrows.
  "You have told me plenty of times how much you liked it."</p>

  <p>"Its one drawback, I should say," he observed, as he rose to his feet, "is
  that you can't get rid of it. Bad sort of perfume for a conspirator. I could
  tell that you had been in a room, for instance, for hours afterwards. Reminds
  one, you know, of that play 'Diplomacy.'"</p>

  <p>She looked at him fixedly.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>His eyes wandered to the doorway, where Ronnie and his host were
  standing.</p>

  <p>"Don't let that fellow De Brest make use of you to do his dirty work for
  him," Dutley begged, as he turned away.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3><br>

  <p class="first">DUTLEY summoned a taxi, and was driven to a large and
  popular Grill Room in the centre of London. Inspector Bridgeman, who, in
  mufti, was a very harmless-looking person indeed, rose from a seat in the
  entrance hall, to greet him.</p>

  <p>"Haven't kept you waiting, I hope?" Dutley asked.</p>

  <p>"Barely a minute," the other assured him.</p>

  <p>A <i>vestiaire</i> relieved them of their coats and hats. A
  <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> found them a quiet table in a corner.</p>

  <p>"It's very kind of you to see me like this," the Inspector acknowledged,
  after lunch had been ordered. "You see I was out of luck last night, or I
  should have been called round to Curzon Street."</p>

  <p>Dutley smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'm just as well pleased that you weren't."</p>

  <p>The Inspector tapped the tablecloth impatiently with his finger.</p>

  <p>"We ought to be working together, Lord Dutley," he regretted.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you had any luck?" Dutley asked blandly.</p>

  <p>"The only discovery I've made during the last few weeks," the Inspector
  confided, "is that you're rather a dark horse."</p>

  <p>"Can't keep anything from the police," Dutley sighed.</p>

  <p>The Inspector leaned across the table, and his voice, although it was low,
  was very stern.</p>

  <p>"You're keeping something already from me pretty effectually," he
  complained. "From the things which happen to you, I'm sure you're in closer
  touch with the criminals than I am."</p>

  <p>Dutley looked a little vague.</p>

  <p>"I had one great stroke of luck," he admitted. "I'd share it with you at
  once if we could come to some sort of an arrangement. I should look upon it
  as a form of Life Insurance."</p>

  <p>"What sort of an arrangement?" the Inspector demanded.</p>

  <p>"If you could give me an undertaking that you would not make a definite
  arrest until you could have your hand upon the formula."</p>

  <p>"That's just what I can't do," Bridgeman lamented. "You must realise that,
  Lord Dutley. There is one crime," he went on, his tone for a moment very
  serious indeed, "which stands apart from all the others. I tell you frankly
  that I wouldn't willingly risk my life to arrest a forger, or the greatest
  swindler in the world, but there isn't one of us in the Yard who wouldn't
  look death in the face any moment to bring in a murderer."</p>

  <p>"Well, there you are, you see&mdash;up against it," Dutley pointed out.
  "You'd let my jolly old business go to pot, and see me starve in the street
  just on a matter of principle. I'll be quite frank with you, Inspector. I
  won't tell you a damned thing until I've got the formula. When I've got that,
  I'll show you the man who murdered poor old Rentoul if he's still alive."</p>

  <p>"Was he in last night's job?" the Inspector asked.</p>

  <p>"He was indirectly connected with it. He wasn't in it," Dutley confided.
  "I haven't seen him, as a matter of fact, for several days. The air seems to
  be a good deal healthier when I don't."</p>

  <p>"You would be willing to admit then, Lord Dutley," the Inspector asked,
  after a brief pause, "that there was a certain connection between the
  burglary in Curzon Street last night and the burglary up at your Works four
  months ago?"</p>

  <p>Dutley considered the matter.</p>

  <p>"In a way, I suppose there was."</p>

  <p>"And one of the same persons was concerned in it?" the Inspector added,
  like a flash.</p>

  <p>Dutley nodded.</p>

  <p>"Very clever&mdash;very clever indeed," he murmured. "If you'd told me
  this was going to be a sort of third or fourth degree luncheon I wouldn't
  have had that second cocktail."</p>

  <p>"Don't think that, Lord Dutley," the Inspector begged. "I've got my job to
  do, but I want to do it decently. We aren't interested in the safe-breaker
  and his friend who got away. I think we could lay our hands upon them at any
  time if we tried. The American I should like to know a little more about.
  Seems queer that he hadn't a card case or anything. His clothes were bought
  ready-made at a shop in the Strand, and his linen is unmarked. They told me
  at the Hospital this morning that he'd very likely go out without regaining
  consciousness."</p>

  <p>"Well, after all," Dutley reflected, "a man doesn't carry his card case
  with him when he commits a burglary."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," the Inspector agreed, "and yet most men, at all times,
  according to my experience, carry pocket-books. There might have been an item
  of interest to us inside. I should very much like to have found some hint as
  to the man's occupation, the method of his daily life&mdash;better still, his
  address. You'll remember, won't you, Lord Dutley, that if he should peg out
  it remains very much with us what happens to that wild black man of
  yours."</p>

  <p>Dutley was silent for a moment. Then he thrust his hand into his pocket
  and produced a worn morocco case.</p>

  <p>"You win, Inspector," he acknowledged. "Mr. Hartley Wright, his name is.
  You'll find a little more about him in there."</p>

  <p>The Inspector scrutinised the contents of the pocket-book with
  interest.</p>

  <p>"You'll excuse my keeping this," he said, carefully disposing of it.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Inspector," Dutley acquiesced, smiling. "I have had all I
  wanted from it."</p>

  <p>The Inspector leaned across the table. One saw something of the man in
  that moment. His jaw seemed to protrude.</p>

  <p>"Hartley Wright was one of the five Marlingthorpe burglars," he murmured
  in a low but very firm tone.</p>

  <p>"There's no keeping things from you, Inspector," Dutley sighed. "He's not
  the worst of the gang, but he was in it all right. There's just one thing,"
  Dutley concluded, with the ghost of a smile at the corners of his lips. "I
  don't mind your knowing so much, because I've been up to the Hospital myself
  this morning, and even if the fellow lives there isn't the faintest chance of
  his recovering consciousness for a week. Very tantalising for you, I know,
  but still, there it is."</p>

  <p>"Then I gather," the Inspector deduced, eyeing his companion shrewdly,
  "that something is likely to happen before that week is up."</p>

  <p>Dutley's smile developed.</p>

  <p>"I'm getting very warm, Inspector," he confided.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch33"
     name="ch33">CHAPTER XXXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE three men were seated in what De Brest liked to call the
  Board Room of his bank, in a narrow passage off Lombard Street. The smooth
  mahogany table was adorned with writing pads and inkstands. The high-backed
  chairs were of black oak and of Dutch design. De Brest, attired with his
  usual meticulous care, sat at the head of the table. He wore a carnation in
  his buttonhole, his tie and linen were irreproachable. His short black coat
  was the best that Savile Row could turn out. His hair was smoothly brushed,
  his finger nails newly manicured. He affected a lightheartedness which he was
  very far from feeling. On his right hand sat Thomas Ryde; on his left,
  Hisedale.</p>

  <p>"We seem to be the survivors," he remarked, with an attempt at jocularity.
  "Has any one heard news of Hartley Wright?"</p>

  <p>"The report from the Hospital this morning was that he was still
  unconscious," Thomas Ryde volunteered.</p>

  <p>"What about his belongings?"</p>

  <p>"We did our best on the first day," was the measured reply. "His landlady
  called for them but they had been removed by the police. It is up to any one
  of us who wishes to qualify in a course for imbecility to pursue his
  enquiries at Scotland Yard."</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence.</p>

  <p>"That means that we are two portions of the receipt short," Hisedale
  observed gloomily, "and Glenaltons are preparing for us on Wednesday."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," De Brest meditated, "that some one will have to go down
  and interview Sir Matthew, if it is true, as they tell us at the hotel, that
  he has gone to Leeds."</p>

  <p>"And the same person," Thomas Ryde sneered, "might call in at Scotland
  Yard and ask for Hartley Wright's pocket-book."</p>

  <p>"It was your scheme, this tearing up the receipt," Hisedale pointed out,
  from across the table.</p>

  <p>"It was my scheme," Thomas Ryde admitted, "but in our progress through
  life we have to be governed by the law of probabilities. There was nothing to
  tell us that, presumably on the instigation of our friend De Brest, Hartley
  Wright was going to embark upon a mad and burglarious scheme in the course of
  which he would be half killed, or that Sir Matthew Parkinson would develop
  lunatic tendencies. I confess that the present situation is distressing. We
  must see what we can do with it, however. In the meantime, have you each your
  fragment of the receipt with you?"</p>

  <p>Both men signified assent. Neither, however, produced his pocket-book.
  Thomas Ryde set the example. From a worn morocco case, he drew out two
  crumpled slips, and from another compartment of the same pocket-book, he
  produced a stiff strip of parchment.</p>

  <p>"I took the opportunity," he explained, "of calling upon our friend Mr.
  Hogg the other day. I put it to him that one of us had met with an accident,
  and that there was a possibility of his portion of the receipt not being
  forthcoming next week when we required our document. I am sorry to have to
  report that his attitude was unsympathetic."</p>

  <p>"What did he say?" De Brest demanded.</p>

  <p>"He pointed out that five of us had brought the document and that his
  responsibility was equally divided between the five. He pointed out, too,
  that the idea had been ours, not his, and he declined to assume the
  responsibility of parting with the key for anything less than the whole
  receipt. His position was logical enough, and I could not deny it."</p>

  <p>"What have you got there?" Hisedale asked, indicating the paper which
  Thomas Ryde had spread out in front of him.</p>

  <p>"This," the latter confided, "is a complete receipt form. I took the
  opportunity of pocketing it whilst Mr. Hogg was out of the room for a moment.
  If you two felt disposed to reciprocate the confidence which I have already
  demonstrated, we might, I thought, arrange our fragments on the back of this
  strip and see exactly what is missing."</p>

  <p>Both men produced their pocket-books. With careful, laborious fingers,
  Thomas Ryde fitted the fragments together so far as he was able and cut up
  the receipt form. It was a sorry business, however, for two of the three
  fragments had evidently been taken from different parts, and their crumpled
  appearance compared ill with the rest of the receipt form.</p>

  <p>"I doubt whether we shall ever be able to do anything in this way," he
  confessed. "On the other hand, we must think of something. We have no reason
  to suppose that Hartley Wright's fragment is permanently unattainable, but
  Sir Matthew I fear that we have treated with a certain lack of tact. He may
  be obstinate. In the meantime," he went on, his fingers passing lightly over
  his chin, "I have a suggestion to make. I am in possession of two fragments
  of the receipt&mdash;my own and Huneybell's. Give me yours, and I will make
  myself responsible, so far as any one can, for framing up the whole document,
  either by procuring their portions from our two missing friends, or by
  dealing with this other form."</p>

  <p>Doctor Hisedale looked across at De Brest, and De Brest returned the gaze
  stealthily. Thomas Ryde had apparently no manner of misgiving as to what
  their reply would be, for he was already opening out a compartment of his
  pocket-book.</p>

  <p>"Is it not a little like putting all our eggs in one basket, Ryde?"
  Hisedale ventured.</p>

  <p>"We haven't seemed to do particularly well separately so far," was the
  brief retort. "It's only four months, and two of the fragments are missing
  already. Anything committed to my care is safe. I do not run risks. That is
  not my way in life."</p>

  <p>They handed over their strips of paper. Thomas Ryde fitted them on to the
  back of the receipt, and sketched in roughly once more the probable shape of
  the missing two.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he warned them, "that we shall find our friend Mr. Hogg a
  little exacting, perhaps a little difficult. I noticed that he had a range of
  magnifying glasses upon his table which he told me were for the purpose of
  identifying any doubtful receipts. I may succeed in getting the originals,
  however. I have already a scheme in my mind."</p>

  <p>"Well, we shall trust in you," De Brest declared, with a sigh. "So far,
  you have been the brains of our enterprise."</p>

  <p>"The controlling brains," Thomas Ryde admitted, "but not the financial
  brains. There we have to turn to you, De Brest. I was sorry to rather force
  this meeting upon you, but you must have a very considerable amount of money
  upon our account in hand, and I thought that we should have a statement of
  account from you, with a cheque. Five thousand pounds each, I think it was,
  Hartley Wright, Hisedale and I agreed to adventure on our 'bear' account
  against Boothroyds. The shares were eighty when you commenced operations.
  To-night I see that they are fifty-seven. A very nice little profit for each
  one of us. Perhaps it would be as well now to close the account for the
  present."</p>

  <p>De Brest fingered his tie nervously.</p>

  <p>"I must tell you both confidentially," he said, "that a very embarrassing
  and difficult situation has arisen with regard to our account. It does not
  affect either of you nearly so much as it does me, because whereas you have
  entered upon a very mild speculation, I, knowing what we know, with larger
  means and resources, went for a big <i>coup</i>. I found some difficulty in
  dealing on this market after the first few days' transactions, so I opened up
  negotiations at every foreign Bourse where Boothroyds are quoted. Everything
  went on quite right, and the fall in prices represents a very large profit,
  but a situation has arisen which I have never before encountered."</p>

  <p>"You're not going to tell us that you're short?" Thomas Ryde asked
  coldly.</p>

  <p>"For the moment, I am, and therefore I cannot realise," De Brest
  confessed. "I did a good deal through a firm of stockjobbers in Amsterdam, in
  which I am a partner, and in whose responsibilities I share. I am getting
  frantic telegrams from them every hour. What we are up against, though, is
  nothing more nor less than a conspiracy. Whoever is working it must lose
  money, and a great deal of money, but there you are&mdash;there are buying
  orders out for Boothroyds placed with five or six different houses, all
  pledged to secrecy, with regard to the name of their client, but all supplied
  with cash, and all demanding delivery of the shares."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde took off his spectacles and wiped them carefully.</p>

  <p>"This sounds to me a very pitiful tale, Baron," he pronounced. "Both
  Doctor Hisedale and I looked upon you as a man of affairs&mdash;a banker, and
  one who knew the money market. I cannot understand your placing yourself in
  such a position. In fact, to tell you the truth, I did not know that it was
  possible."</p>

  <p>"It would not be possible in this country alone," De Brest explained. "It
  is my connection with the firm of Jansen and De Brest in Amsterdam, which has
  done the mischief. Then, in an ordinary way, an unlimited buying order like
  this would have made all the jobbers shy. The whole business was kept so
  ridiculously secret, however, that no one seems to have realised what was
  happening. You see, after all, Boothroyds are a narrow market. There should
  be another five hundred thousand pounds' worth of shares floating about.
  Dutley's got them all locked up. He has not parted with a share. He will not
  part with any. Our 'bear' account was nothing tremendous, but it came up
  against an absurd scarcity of the shares."</p>

  <p>"I do not understand this business very well," Hisedale remarked, "but I
  should like some money. You commenced to sell shares for us at seventy-eight.
  They are now fifty-seven, and there have already been two settlements. There
  should be a great deal of money for us."</p>

  <p>They both ignored him. There was a very wicked gleam indeed in Thomas
  Ryde's eyes, and De Brest's hands were shaking as he restlessly moved some
  papers.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it has never occurred to you, Baron," Ryde suggested, with a
  bitter, underlying sarcasm in his tone, "that the man who has given out this
  buying order for shares, and so completely outwitted you, is probably the
  young man whom you have always termed such a nincompoop&mdash;Lord Dutley
  himself?"</p>

  <p>"I have convinced myself of that within the last few hours," De Brest
  admitted. "Everything that a man could do, I have done. I have even tried to
  buy a quantity of Lord Dutley's holdings at a price far above the market
  figure, meaning to bear the loss myself. He has refused to deal with me."</p>

  <p>"You have also," Thomas Ryde continued, "without consulting us, made a
  clumsy and ill-conceived attempt to possess yourself of his share
  certificates, and by means of a forged order to the bank, get them upon the
  market. Here again, you have failed, and in sacrificing Hartley Wright you
  have possibly placed us all in a very dangerous position."</p>

  <p>"I was driven to do what I did," De Brest exclaimed, with a little burst
  of passion. "You men who are nobodies don't understand. I am a banker of
  European repute. I have a great position to keep up. I simply dare not let
  the world of finance know that I have been caught short of shares like this.
  Credit is the breath of life to a banker. I call myself to-day a millionaire,
  but heaven knows where I shall be if this affair gets about."</p>

  <p>"How do you propose to keep it secret?" Thomas Ryde asked. "Settlement day
  is close at hand, and it appears to me that you will be unable to fulfil your
  obligations. We never thought very highly of you as an associate, Baron, but
  we did trust you financially. You have deceived us, and not many men have
  done that, so far as I am concerned. I never held a very exalted opinion of
  the order of your brains, but I thought that at least you were cunning enough
  to carry out the ordinary day-by-day financial operations of your following.
  I see that I was wrong. You are a fool."</p>

  <p>De Brest seemed somehow to have wilted. He buried his face in his
  hands.</p>

  <p>"I am a damned fool!" he confessed.</p>

  <p>"I have a thing to say," Hisedale intervened. "Even if we have not made
  money, I parted with a thousand pounds for cover, which has never been
  required. They are in the bank. I will take them away with me."</p>

  <p>"There ought to be a profit due to me," Thomas Ryde said coolly, "of a
  great deal more than that. I, however, will take a thousand pounds to be
  going on with."</p>

  <p>De Brest looked out over the glass-topped window into the bank. There were
  a dozen clerks behind the desk and one or two customers at the counter. He
  glanced nervously at the clock. It was three minutes to four. Turning back,
  he touched a button upon his table. A clerk almost immediately presented
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Bring me a cheque form on my private account," De Brest directed.</p>

  <p>The man withdrew.</p>

  <p>"You know, after all," De Brest went on, leaning back in his chair, "I
  think perhaps we have got the wind up too much about settlement day. We are
  really not very short for the English market, and we have a dozen people on
  the look-out for shares for us. We may get a parcel tumbling in at any
  moment. You shall have the profits on the English market if we make them,
  both of you. Our trouble is abroad. I cannot explain. It is too complicated,
  but if there is any loss there I shall bear it myself."</p>

  <p>"Our profits on the English market will be enough for us," Thomas Ryde
  rejoined pointedly.</p>

  <p>The clerk reappeared with a blank cheque form, to which was pinned a
  little written slip. De Brest glanced at it and tore it up. He spread the
  cheque form on the table before him. His hand was trembling so that the ink
  with which he filled his pen dropped on the tablecloth. He wrote the date on
  the cheque and paused. The telephone by his side rang. He took off the
  receiver, and listened, indulging in a few monosyllables only.</p>

  <p>"Boothroyds closed at fifty-eight," he announced, as he discarded the
  instrument.</p>

  <p>A clock close at hand struck four times&mdash;a sound for which he had
  been waiting anxiously. He affected not to notice and filled out the cheque
  for two thousand pounds, turned it over, and endorsed it. Then touched the
  bell again.</p>

  <p>"Notes for this," he told the clerk, handing it across.</p>

  <p>The man looked grave.</p>

  <p>"Very sorry, sir," he said. "Mr. Peterson has just closed up the safes.
  It's nearly five minutes past four."</p>

  <p>De Brest took out his watch hastily.</p>

  <p>"I had no idea it was so late," he exclaimed. "I am very sorry, Mr. Ryde.
  It is against the English banking law for us to pay out money after closing
  hours, and they are very severe on us foreigners. Would ten o'clock to-morrow
  morning do?"</p>

  <p>Ryde pointed to the waiting clerk.</p>

  <p>"Send him away for a moment, please," he demanded.</p>

  <p>The man obeyed De Brest's gesture, and closed the door behind him. Thomas
  Ryde's voice seemed to have become quieter than ever.</p>

  <p>"De Brest," he pronounced, "I mistrust you. I have always mistrusted you.
  The mistake of my life was to come into this affair with such men as you.
  However, I am in and I must pay for my mistake. I am going to have that
  thousand pounds, though. So is Doctor Hisedale."</p>

  <p>De Brest laughed, noisily but uneasily.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear friends," he protested, "what is a matter of a thousand
  pounds? Surely to-morrow morning will do?"</p>

  <p>"I am beginning to think that a matter of a thousand pounds is a matter of
  a good deal to you," Thomas Ryde rejoined slowly. "Baron, we ought to have
  shared at least a hundred thousand pounds, and it is entirely your fault that
  Sir Matthew has broken away from us, and that we've lost Hartley Wright. I
  shall run the rest of this business as a one-man show. I shall possess myself
  of the formula within the next few days, and I shall conclude the
  negotiations with Glenaltons on Wednesday. The million pounds I receive from
  them will be divided between the five of us, if Hartley Wright is still
  alive, and between the four of us if he is dead, but, from your share, I
  shall deduct the amount which we have lost through your idiotic manipulation
  of our financial scheme. Is that clearly understood?"</p>

  <p>"No," De Brest remonstrated frantically. "You took your risks with me. The
  market went against us."</p>

  <p>"Baron de Brest," Thomas Ryde said, "you get what I have offered you, what
  I have told you that you will get, or you get a little less than nothing. You
  can guess what I mean. I do not argue. You know now what is coming to you.
  You take your choice. From now on, everything is out of your hands. If you
  make any move, it will be reported to me. There is one sort of move," he
  concluded, with a queer little drop in his voice, "which, if you make, will
  end all your troubles."</p>

  <p>They left De Brest at that. He listened to their departing footsteps,
  leaning back in his chair at the head of the long table. From the interior of
  the bank, on the other side of the glass partition, came the sound of the
  slamming of books, cheerful voices proclaiming the end of the day's work.
  Business with the House of De Brest was not good, and there was no need to
  stay overtime. The telephone at his elbow tinkled. It was Lucille's drawling
  voice speaking.</p>

  <p>"Still at work?"</p>

  <p>He made a great effort.</p>

  <p>"Still at work, and hard at it," he replied briskly. "We have a conference
  here about the exchanges. Our friends from Paris are a little difficult!"</p>

  <p>"I won't keep you," Lucille promised. "I just rang up to remind you about
  something. Can you guess what?"</p>

  <p>"Not for the moment."</p>

  <p>"To call at Cartier's. I hated doing it, and Charles guessed. I'll tell
  you about that later. I suppose I shall forget it as soon as I've seen the
  necklace. <i>Au revoir!</i>"</p>

  <p>"As soon as you've seen the necklace. <i>Au revoir</i>," De Brest echoed
  mechanically.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch34"
     name="ch34">CHAPTER XXXIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FROM the foggy gloom of the December afternoon, her abrupt
  entrance into his cosily lit library seemed something unreal, fortuitously
  fantastic. She had reached the hearthrug before Burdett's discreet
  announcement had left his lips.</p>

  <p>"Lucille!" Dutley exclaimed, rising to his feet in amazement.</p>

  <p>She stopped Burdett, who was leaving the room.</p>

  <p>"Cocktails, please. The old sort. And cigarettes. May I sit down?"</p>

  <p>She took assent for granted and threw open further still her fur coat. She
  was dressed in the quaint fashion of the day&mdash;thick furs over a thin
  cr&ecirc;pe de chine dress, gossamer-like, notwithstanding its narrow fur
  edging. Her silk stockings and patent shoes defied the snow and slush which
  lay upon the ground.</p>

  <p>"I had to come and say good-bye, Charles dear," she explained, "and to
  make my <i>apologia</i>. I should never have been happy if I had left you
  without a word."</p>

  <p>"Good-bye?" he repeated. "Where are you off to?"</p>

  <p>"Paris&mdash;Egypt&mdash;Khartoum, I hope."</p>

  <p>"Alone?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. With Sigismund de Brest."</p>

  <p>He looked grave. She laughed mockingly across at him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you don't know everything!" she exclaimed. "You standardise qualities
  and you think that love and hate must fall into line with them. When I
  thought that you were a fool, and Siggie a brilliant financier, then I
  believe that I remained more than half in love with you. When I found out
  that Siggie was half a fool and half a rogue, that you had had your tongue in
  your cheek all the time, and were laughing at us, that you were clever, brave
  and unusual, then I became a little more than half in love with Siggie. He's
  the down dog, you see, and I'm going to take care of him."</p>

  <p>Burdett brought in cocktails. There was a queer little flush in her cheeks
  as she raised her glass. She lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Siggie's going broke, Charles," she confided. "Don't you bother. Get what
  you can out of the estate if he owes you anything. I don't think he ever was
  any good as a financier. Luckily I've got enough for both and I'm going to
  take care of him. There's just one thing, though, I didn't come here to ask
  favours. I know everything, now, you see. That burglary&mdash;he had nothing
  to do with the shooting. Keep him out of it if you can. I don't want to be a
  grass widow, and my husband wearing stripes. I'm going to remake Siggie if I
  can get him away for a year or two. You won't know him later
  on&mdash;really."</p>

  <p>"Well, you've reckoned it all out, I suppose, Lucille," Dutley remarked.
  "I'm sure I wish you luck."</p>

  <p>She glanced at her watch.</p>

  <p>"We're catching the last boat for Paris from Croydon," she continued.
  "That's what I love about Siggie. He has such a sense of the dramatic. He
  would fly, with the thunder beginning to rumble behind him. Charles, I am
  beginning to understand things now, although Siggie is such a sweet coward he
  dares not say much. Just this, though&mdash;look out for Thomas Ryde."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," Dutley assured her. "I've got my eye on him, Lucille,
  but what about this crossing to-night to Paris?"</p>

  <p>"You darling!" she laughed. "Every now and then one realises how
  thoroughly you were born in Leeds. We were married at the registry office
  after lunch. Quick, shake me that last cocktail! The boat won't wait, and
  Siggie's terrified to death. It's perfectly lovely having to find courage for
  two. Here's luck, Charles! Marry Grace and thank God for really good women. I
  say really good, because I'm not really bad."</p>

  <p>She was gone, almost before he could ring the bell, almost before Burdett
  could hand her into the limousine laden with rugs and luggage. Dutley stepped
  back into his study, with its odd perfume of violets and furs, a little
  dazed. It was the end of a chapter of his life. He took down the telephone
  and put a trunk call through to Leeds. Burdett made his appearance.</p>

  <p>"Are you dining in, my lord?" he asked him.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite know. I am waiting for another caller. If he
  comes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There's a person been here for quarter of an hour, my lord," Burdett
  confided. "You know him very well&mdash;the funny little man who found us out
  at Highgate. He's here still."</p>

  <p>Dutley frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>"Show him in," he directed, "but don't open the front door to any one else
  whilst he's here, and have a taxicab waiting for him in the Mews."</p>

  <p>"Very good, my lord."</p>

  <p>He disappeared for a few minutes, and re-entered, ushering in the visitor.
  Mr. Edward Wolf was a little more furtive than usual, a little less tidy. He
  came in stealthily and he began to speak as soon as the door was closed.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to stop," he said. "Have you seen them things that fly
  around in the air?"</p>

  <p>"Have I what?" Dutley demanded, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Aeroplanes&mdash;airships&mdash;whatever they like to call 'em. They take
  you high up, over the seas, into the clouds, over foreign countries. You've
  got all the money in the world, Guv'nor. You can buy one of them, or hire it,
  whatever they do. Get one and go. It's a still night to-night. There's no
  wind, only a trifle of sleet. I've been up to Highgate. I don't know why, but
  there it is, I don't want to see you done in. He's coming down, Guv'nor.
  There was something he wanted to do to-day and he couldn't. He's coming down
  to you. He's got a nice, tidy little car waiting outside the Towers and he's
  just packing a bag, planning his get-away, I expect. Don't you sit here and
  wait for him."</p>

  <p>"Why not? As a matter of fact I rather want to see Mr. Thomas Ryde."</p>

  <p>The little man shivered from head to foot.</p>

  <p>"If you wants to commit suicide," he groaned, "you do it. I tell you, he's
  coming, and he's coming to-night, and what he wants from you he'll get, and
  he'll leave you where he's left the others. I've known all the great
  criminals. I wasn't ever afraid of them. He ain't a criminal, Thomas Ryde.
  They haven't got his finger prints at Scotland Yard. They never will have.
  You'll find his name in the directory. He's got a telephone number. He's
  never been in trouble, never had a policeman touch him on the shoulder, never
  seen the inside of a Police Court. God, Mister, I'd have given you back your
  hundred pounds sooner than have come here, but there was something made me
  come. Get away, while you can. Let the police do their own dirty work. A few
  bulls more or less won't matter. You keep outside of it."</p>

  <p>Dutley lit a cigarette very deliberately.</p>

  <p>"Don't you worry, Wolf," he begged. "I don't fancy Thomas Ryde will be
  likely to pay me any afternoon call before six o'clock. If he does, I'll be
  ready for him."</p>

  <p>"Guv'nor, he's a killer," the little man insisted with a shudder.</p>

  <p>"Then you be off," Dutley advised. "There's a taxicab waiting for you in
  the Mews, and here's a tenner for coming down."</p>

  <p>Dutley rang the bell, and the terrified man departed in Burdett's care.
  The latter reappeared presently.</p>

  <p>"Do you know yet whether you will be dining in, my lord?" he asked once
  more.</p>

  <p>"I'm still not quite sure. I'm expecting a caller. You can get my bath
  ready at the usual time. A short coat will do, I think."</p>

  <p>The front door bell rang.</p>

  <p>"If that should be a middle-aged, precise-looking gentleman, with gold
  spectacles, name of Thomas Ryde, you can show him in, Burdett."</p>

  <p>Burdett lapsed for a moment from the perfectly trained servant to the
  watcher at Highgate. There was a gleam of fear in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"My lord," he expostulated, "you're not seeing him in
  here&mdash;alone?"</p>

  <p>Dutley smiled reassuringly.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry," he enjoined. "I've made my plans. Isn't that the bell
  again?"</p>

  <p>Burdett turned reluctantly away, closed the door, and re-opened it a
  moment or two later.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Thomas Ryde, my lord," he announced.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch35"
     name="ch35">CHAPTER XXXV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE room was dimly but sufficiently lit. Thomas Ryde
  advanced a few paces and looked around keenly.</p>

  <p>"No ambush?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"We are alone," Dutley assured him. "Pray take off your overcoat, unless
  it contains your spare armoury. You will find that chair comfortable. I
  gather that you are a man of correct habits. Let us discuss anything that
  there may be to be discussed first, and leave the other things till
  afterwards."</p>

  <p>"I make no arrangements with you, nor do I give any promise," Thomas Ryde
  said, slowly removing his overcoat, and hanging it upon the back of a chair.
  "I am under a disadvantage in coming here. This room appears to be empty, but
  for anything I know I may have walked into a trap."</p>

  <p>"Beyond my servants, there is no one in the vicinity at present," Dutley
  told him. "Let us proceed. You were disappointed in your visit to Mr. Hogg
  to-day?"</p>

  <p>"I was disappointed," Thomas Ryde admitted, seating himself deliberately
  in an easy-chair. "I had imagined the man to possess more intelligence. Only
  two pieces of the receipt were missing, and duplicates for these have been
  very cleverly faked. Mr. Hogg, I think, was unreasonable."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't have got away with it," Dutley confided. "I had been there.
  That was why I was expecting your visit this evening. You smoke, perhaps, or
  a cocktail?"</p>

  <p>"Neither, thanks."</p>

  <p>"I had previously," Dutley continued, "made my own application. That was
  even more hopeless than yours. The safe was in the names of five people, and
  to have it opened the five people must speak together."</p>

  <p>"We come to this," Mr. Thomas Ryde remarked, his hand hovering round his
  coat pocket. "I have four portions of the receipt. You have two. Since our
  friend is so obdurate, and the million is available at half-past six this
  evening, and since we're neither of us anxious to invoke the aid of the
  police, let us deal on that basis."</p>

  <p>Dutley shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't do that," he regretted. "You see, the whole formula belongs to
  me. That is what I want&mdash;the formula."</p>

  <p>"Not the million, or a share of it?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not. You see, the formula happens to be the property of my
  firm, and I'm not inclined to buy it back. I'm going to take it back."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde smiled in very peculiar fashion.</p>

  <p>"What about my four parts of the receipt?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Very compromising," Dutley warned him. "I should get rid of them as soon
  as possible. There's the fireplace at your service. The only trouble is that
  I'm afraid you are too late."</p>

  <p>"Am I?" Thomas Ryde queried softly, and his hand disappeared for a moment
  in the fold of his coat.</p>

  <p>"It's a question of which of us can draw the more quickly," Dutley went
  on, his eyes glued upon those disappearing fingers. "I rather fancy myself. I
  knew that you were coming. I encouraged the interview because I had perhaps
  an unwholesome sort of curiosity to see you face to face. It isn't my place
  to give you advice, but, funnily enough, although you deserve it, I never
  like to hear of a man being hanged. You are still listening?"</p>

  <p>"I am listening."</p>

  <p>"I admit that there was a time when, badly though I wanted the formula, I
  refused to have anything to do with the police. That was when you were a
  united little band, and I feared that as soon as you were conscious of
  danger, your first action would be to destroy the formula. That fear has gone
  now. You can't touch the formula unless you take my two fragments of the
  receipt away from me. I, on the other hand, should be able to get it by
  collaborating with the police, and proving that it is stolen property."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know that you are talking yourself into the grave," Thomas
  Ryde declared. "Unnecessary bloodshed never appealed to me, but those two
  fragments of the receipt you hold I must have."</p>

  <p>"'Must' is a word which has gone out of fashion with me," Dutley said
  quietly. "Besides, reflect for a moment. You are twenty-four hours too late.
  From the moment I left there this afternoon, Mr. Hogg's office in the
  International Safe Deposit Company became the spider's parlour for you."</p>

  <p>Again there was that peculiar glitter behind the gold-rimmed
  spectacles.</p>

  <p>"You are very much of an amateur in these affairs, Lord Dutley," he
  remarked. "I have walked into a spider's parlour before, and the spider has
  been sorry for it. I have my own plans, but to complete them I require those
  two fragments of the receipt. I begin to doubt whether you have them."</p>

  <p>Dutley's fingers searched for his pocket-book, and like a flash, the ugly
  muzzle of Thomas Ryde's revolver shot out.</p>

  <p>"Put your hands up!" he directed. "This second! I'll find your
  pocket-book."</p>

  <p>Dutley obeyed.</p>

  <p>"A very clever trick," he approved. "Next order, please."</p>

  <p>"With your left hand," Thomas Ryde enjoined, "throw your pocket-book upon
  the table. Be quick about it."</p>

  <p>Dutley sighed.</p>

  <p>"I always felt a presentiment that you were too clever for me, Thomas
  Ryde. There it is."</p>

  <p>He did as he was bidden. Thomas Ryde came stealthily across the room. His
  revolver seemed to be a part of his arm. Never once did it falter. He picked
  up the pocket-book, fingered its contents, and thrust it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Would you have any objection to my putting my hands down?" Dutley asked.
  "The position tires me and I am unarmed."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde smiled coldly.</p>

  <p>"That seems to me scarcely probable," he observed.</p>

  <p>Dutley rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"You can squeeze that nasty little implement of yours into my side whilst
  you go over me," he suggested.</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde came nearer. He still walked very stealthily. He gave one the
  impression of a robot man, mechanically directed, with a sense of
  infallibility. His left hand passed all over Dutley's body. Presently he
  stepped back.</p>

  <p>"You can put your hands down," he conceded.</p>

  <p>Dutley resumed his seat.</p>

  <p>"That is certainly more comfortable," he admitted, lighting a cigarette.
  "In the language of the classics, Mr. Thomas Ryde, you have come, you have
  seen, you have conquered. You have now the whole receipt. My curiosity as to
  your personality is satisfied. What remains?"</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde moved a pace or two back.</p>

  <p>"Only this," he announced. "I am going to kill you."</p>

  <p>"You can't mean that," Dutley expostulated. "An unarmed man!"</p>

  <p>"I shall kill you for two reasons," Thomas Ryde explained, in his calm,
  expressionless tone. "In the first place&mdash;do not think that I have not
  realised it&mdash;it is you who have broken up our little company, you who
  have disarranged our plans, you who have made my chance of getting that
  million pounds I had set my heart upon, a somewhat desperate one. That is the
  first reason why you are going to die. The next is that if I leave you alive
  you will destroy my last chance of finding my way out of that spider's
  parlour this evening. There is even a third reason. I permit myself few
  personal likes or dislikes, but I have always disliked you."</p>

  <p>"Since when?"</p>

  <p>"Since you knocked my first ball into the pavilion at Lord's in the Eton
  and Harrow match twenty years ago. I was taking wickets when you came in. It
  was going to be my match. You knocked me off my length, and they were foolish
  enough to take me off."</p>

  <p>"So you were that Thomas Ryde, after all!" Dutley reflected. "Slim, wiry
  little chap you were then."</p>

  <p>"I was that Thomas Ryde. In those days, my father was a chartered
  accountant. His firm were accountants to Boothroyds. Your father quarreled
  with him, and he lost the best audit the firm ever had. Things went wrong
  afterwards. My father died a bankrupt, about the same year, I should think,
  as yours became a millionaire. I do not approve of personal feelings, Lord
  Dutley, but I have always permitted myself the luxury of hating you. I was
  employed in my capacity of economist to look into the expense accounts of
  your firm some time ago. It was down there that I learned about your
  business, came into touch with the formula, worked out this plan for securing
  my own fortune, and as I hoped, your ruin."</p>

  <p>"A little spiteful, weren't you?" Dutley remonstrated. "Couldn't you put
  down that thing," he suggested, waving his hand at the revolver, "whilst
  we're having this pleasant little chat?"</p>

  <p>"The chat is over. I shall see now whether you are a brave man. Lord
  Dutley, or only a <i>poseur</i>, for so sure as I stand here, when I have
  counted three, I am pulling the trigger of this gun. Do you hear?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I hear you," Dutley replied. "Get along with it."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde was once more the robot, mechanical-like figure. The muzzle of
  his villainous-looking weapon was pointed straight at Dutley's heart. For the
  first time, as he began to count, there came a single touch of humanity in
  the glitter of his eyes behind his spectacles.</p>

  <p>"One.... two.... <span class="smcap">THREE</span>!"</p>

  <p>There was a hard, metallic click. No stab of flame&mdash;no report. The
  same thing was repeated, and probably for the first, and certainly for the
  last time in his life, Thomas Ryde lost his nerve and his poise. The miracle
  was in itself stupefying. The next moment, Dutley's fist had shot out to his
  jaw. He was lying on the carpet, and the room was swimming before his eyes.
  He was dimly conscious of Dutley drawing a revolver very similar to his own
  from a drawer in the table. He heard a far-away voice speaking into the
  telephone. Then he was aware again of Dutley bending over him, a very grim
  look in his sunburnt, youthful face. He made an effort at speech, pointing to
  the revolver.</p>

  <p>"I admit I've had all the luck," Dutley said. "We go to the same
  gunsmith&mdash;best maker of dud cartridges in England. Merest chance in the
  world he spoke to me about your revolver shooting. I got him to change your
  cartridges&mdash;thought you were safer with the duds."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde made one more effort, but collapsed again.</p>

  <p>"I'm beaten!" he gasped.</p>

  <p>The telephone bell rang. Dutley took off the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Scotland Yard," he repeated. "I'm Lord Dutley, yes.... Inspector
  Bridgeman is on his way&mdash;will arrive in three minutes? Good!... Tell him
  to come straight into my library."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde was clinging to the leg of the table in his efforts to sit up.
  He reached for his useless revolver, and with trembling fingers drew out the
  cartridges. There was a curious change in his face. The hard, cruel mouth had
  drooped. The glitter behind those spectacles had gone, replaced by the shadow
  of fear.</p>

  <p>"Dutley," he faltered, "you've got me. I'm done. There's only one thing
  I'm terrified of&mdash;the rope. Give me one of your cartridges. That's the
  way you'd go out yourself. Give me one!"</p>

  <p>He staggered to his feet, supporting himself against the table. Dutley
  hesitated. Ryde seemed incapable of further speech. He dangled his revolver
  before him with the breech open. With a little shrug of the shoulders, Dutley
  took a cartridge from the drawer and dropped it in.</p>

  <p>"You'd better not be long about it," he warned him. "That's Bridgeman's
  car outside."</p>

  <p>Thomas Ryde closed the breech of his revolver with unexpected strength. He
  leaned sprawling across the table. Dutley suddenly looked once more into the
  dark muzzle.</p>

  <p>"This is what I'm going to swing for!" Thomas Ryde called out
  joyfully.</p>

  <p>Dutley's leap was a magnificent effort, but he felt the scorch of the
  bullet as it whizzed past his cheek. With a yell of disappointment, Ryde
  threw up his arms. The revolver fell on to the carpet. Dutley's hand was upon
  his throat when Bridgeman and two officers came hurriedly in.</p>

  <p>"Here's your man, Bridgeman!" Dutley exclaimed. "Take him away. He's a
  nasty fellow."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THE telephone rang once more.</p>

  <p>"My long distance call?" Dutley enquired.... "Good! Through to Leeds, am
  I?... That you, Grace?... Yes, dear, it's Charles. Got a message for your
  father first.... Good!... Tell him to get down to the Works early to-morrow
  morning. Reinstate all hands. I'm coming with the formula by the twelve
  o'clock train from St. Pancras.... And, Grace, will you marry me?"</p>
