  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p>The dignified-looking usher, holding his long black rod in one hand and
  dressed with the formality which his position demanded, after a few seconds
  of silent waiting leaned towards the Judge. The latter, wearing all the
  paraphernalia of his almost sacred office, had sunk a little forward in his
  chair and was watching through half-closed eyes the thickly packed crowd of
  men and women who had risen to their feet in anticipation of his departure.
  The echo of the prisoner's shout which had rung through the court a few
  seconds before seemed to be still vibrating in the air.</p>

  <p>"Your Lordship," his attendant murmured.</p>

  <p>The Judge seemed to wake from a moment's silent reverie. At the sound of
  the usher's voice, however, he was no longer distrait. He rose to his feet in
  dignified fashion, a fine figure of a man, bowed to the court, and with slow
  majesty followed his guardian angel down the steps and into his
  retiring-room. His valet, who was waiting there, and the junior ushers busied
  themselves in removing the emblems of his high office.</p>

  <p>"An unusual case, Robinson," he remarked to his clerk, who was standing
  by.</p>

  <p>"Very unusual, my lord," was the respectful answer.</p>

  <p>"In my twenty years of office," continued the Lord Chief Justice, whilst
  he submitted himself to the ministrations of his attendants, "I have never
  overcome my repugnance to wearing that ghastly signal of a human being's
  approaching doom. Today I was particularly glad to be spared the ordeal of
  donning that hideous black cap and addressing the prisoner. I ask myself with
  some curiosity, Robinson," he added, turning to the clerk, "whether Sir
  Frederick had any previous intimation that the prisoner was contemplating
  this action?"</p>

  <p>"I have no idea, my lord," Robinson replied. "It came as a great surprise
  to the court generally."</p>

  <p>"A changed plea during the course of a trial for murder," the Judge
  continued, "is not an unheard-of event, although it is unusual. I remember it
  twice in my own career. Some previous intimation to the judge, though, should
  be obligatory. In this case, however, as there seemed to be no element of
  doubt as to the prisoner's guilt, it did not make any difference. Otherwise,
  the official trying the case would naturally have liked a little further time
  for consideration before pronouncing his decision."</p>

  <p>"If your Lordship will excuse my saying so," the clerk ventured, "the
  sentence pronounced by the court was the only one possible under the
  circumstances. I think perhaps a cup of tea&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Judge assented.</p>

  <p>"Kindly see that all preparations are made for my departure. I will sign
  the necessary papers and return home as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>"Sir Frederick Leversen has sent in a message to know if he can have a
  word with your Lordship," the chief usher announced. "His son, Mr. Samuel
  Leversen, is with him, too."</p>

  <p>"I will receive no visitors here this afternoon," was the terse reply.</p>

  <p>In his capacious leather armchair, Lord Malladene, Chief Justice of the
  Supreme Court, and without doubt a future Lord Chancellor, sipped his tea and
  looked thoughtfully into the embers. That he was a little disturbed in his
  mind became obvious to Robinson, who knew him well. The latter, who was a
  perfect reflex of his master's moods, became uneasy.</p>

  <p>"Your Lordship will forgive my remark, but bearing in mind your well-known
  aversion to applying the capital sentence, the ending of today's trial has
  been most satisfactory," he suggested.</p>

  <p>Lord Malladene nodded slightly, but the frown remained upon his face.</p>

  <p>"In a sense you are right, Robinson," he admitted, "yet there was one, to
  me, jarring note. I disliked the prisoner's sudden cry as he left the dock.
  He seemed to fling it back as a last hope. It made one wonder what was in his
  mind when he changed his plea. 'I lied,' he called out; 'I am not guilty!'
  That was very foolish of him, Robinson."</p>

  <p>"It was just an impulse, your Lordship," the clerk replied. "I should
  forget it."</p>

  <p>The Judge rose to his feet. The frown remained.</p>

  <p>"I would forget it if I could," he said.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>It was the height of the Season, and London was very full; the pavements
  were crowded, but the newspaper-sellers, although they were pushed off the
  kerb in many places, still held their own and sold their papers. They had
  sensational news to offer.</p><br>

  <p class="headline">FAMOUS MURDER TRIAL: RESULT</p><br>

  <p>was on the sheet they waved backwards and forwards, and men and women on
  every side, passers-by of every description, who were anxious to know the
  fate of Richard Lebur, produced their pennies and turned to the stop-press
  news. It was the first subject of conversation exchanged by men home from
  their day's work, meeting at the club, or lingering over the cocktail
  bar.</p>

  <p>"So they found Lebur guilty," someone observed in the bar of the
  Sheridan.</p>

  <p>"Don't see how they could do anything else!"</p>

  <p>"Read your paper, my dear fellow," his companion enjoined. "There was no
  trial after all. He asked permission to change his plea."</p>

  <p>"You mean that he admitted his guilt? Foolish thing to do, it seems to
  me."</p>

  <p>"Did it to save his neck, I suppose," the other remarked. "They have to
  show a little extra consideration to a man who saves his country the expense
  of a long trial. There could have been but one end to it if they'd fought it
  out to a finish."</p>

  <p>"And that?"</p>

  <p>"He would have been found guilty and hanged."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>"I'm sorry for his wife," a peeress acknowledged in reply to her host's
  opening comment at a fashionable dinner party. "She is little more than a
  child, but she is making a name for herself as an artist. She is to have a
  small show of her own soon, I believe, at the Mona Gallery."</p>

  <p>"Can't think what she married such a fellow for," her companion
  muttered.</p>

  <p>"I never met either of them," the lady observed. "The girl is quite
  striking-looking, I've been told."</p>

  <p>"I've met her once," a woman on the other side of the table interposed.
  "She has just that touch of the unusual that most of these artists
  affect."</p>

  <p>"She is a very beautiful picture herself," declared an elderly lady, who
  was known as an art critic.</p>

  <p>"It seems a ghastly pity that she should have married a man of Lebur's
  type," the host pronounced. "He and his father own picture-galleries, I know,
  and I daresay it was because of the son's leanings towards art that they came
  together, but the man's a rotter."</p>

  <p>"Well, he's got it in the neck now," another reflected. "Penal servitude
  for life! Just think what that means. Never a moment when you can walk about
  the earth a free man again, look into the shop windows, drop into your club
  for lunch, and pay a call on your best girl during the afternoon. I'm not
  sure that the other isn't better."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>In a large, rather untidy studio, on the second floor of a block of
  Chelsea flats, a young woman was seated close to a high, bare window opposite
  an easel, upon which stood the unfinished study of an old man. All the
  appurtenances of her craft were laid out upon a small oak table within easy
  reach. She showed no inclination, however, towards work. Occasionally she
  gazed down to the river, now and then looking up to watch the drifting
  clouds. She was quite alone, and from her frequent glances into the street
  below it seemed as though she might be waiting for someone. In time her
  patience was rewarded, for the bell which rang from a landing entrance to the
  studio pealed softly. She rose to her feet, walked to the door, and opened
  it.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad that you have come," she said simply. "Please sit down. I am
  quite prepared to hear what you have to tell me."</p>

  <p>A small, fragile old gentleman, dressed in sober black and wearing an
  almost clerical-looking felt hat, sank into an easy-chair. With both hands
  upon his stick he leaned forward and watched her draw up a stool opposite to
  him.</p>

  <p>"You have not heard?" he asked. "You did not send for a paper?"</p>

  <p>"No," she admitted. "I preferred to hear it from you, here, just like
  this."</p>

  <p>"Your husband, at the last moment, changed his plea, with permission from
  the Judge. He changed it to 'guilty'&mdash;and instead of leaving this world,
  my dear, by a disgraceful death, he was sentenced to penal servitude for
  life."</p>

  <p>"Penal servitude for life." She repeated the words almost mechanically.
  "That means that he will never be free again?"</p>

  <p>"Never," her visitor gasped. "Forgive me if I seem affected," he added,
  for there were tears in his eyes, "but after all, you must remember that he
  was my son. He was an evil man, an unrighteous son, and an unfaithful
  husband&mdash;but he was my son, and when he was young I loved him."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand and took his.</p>

  <p>"My dear," she murmured, "I am so sorry for you. Believe me, I am
  sorry."</p>

  <p>"It is generous of you," he confessed quietly. "I was a wicked man to let
  an innocent girl like you marry a man whom I knew to be evil; but you are so
  pure, so sweet in yourself, I thought the beauty you would pour into his life
  might change him. I was wrong. I was wicked ever to take the chance. Leaving
  all that out of consideration, dear Pamela, what has happened now is for the
  best. He is out of your way; he is where he can do no harm in the world. I
  pray God only that he may repent."</p>

  <p>"I am very, very sorry," she said. "You are a good man, Simon Lebur; you
  should have had a good son to comfort you in your old age."</p>

  <p>"And you," he groaned, his cold white fingers responding to the pressure
  of hers, "should have had a good husband who would have made your life a
  happy one. I thank God that his mother is dead, that there is no one to
  sorrow with us. I am on my way now down the short footpath that leads to the
  end of this world, and I am very glad that it should be so. You are left to
  suffer, my child, but I have come to beg you to cast this trouble from you
  and to stamp out the memory of it from your life. They say that I come of a
  stern race&mdash;perhaps I do&mdash;but my heart softens for those who
  deserve it. You deserve happiness and you will find it. You have a great gift
  and you will make use of it. You will become famous! Soon I shall show your
  work all by itself in my principal gallery."</p>

  <p>She said nothing, but the light was burning again in her eyes. She glanced
  towards the canvas.</p>

  <p>"I will bring the great critics to you; they will take the word of Simon
  Lebur, and they will know genius when they see it. Never let this cloud hang
  over or darken your life. I am an old man," he added, leaning over and
  smoothing her hand, "but I look upon you as my child. The allowance I made my
  son, when I forbade his presence at the galleries, will come to you, and when
  I die, all that would have been his will also come to you. Forget your
  misery, dear, and these terrible days&mdash;live amongst the immortals. I
  stand on the earth and I look upwards, but God has given me one gift and one
  gift only. I know those who will take their place amongst the great dead, the
  masters who poured joy upon the world, Michael Angelo, Fra Lippo Lippi,
  Raphael&mdash;you, too, have their genius, my child. God bless you. I have
  lost my son, but I am proud of my faraway daughter."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p>Inspector Charlesworth held a card which his orderly had just presented to
  him between his thumb and first finger and eyed it disparagingly. There was
  nothing about it with which he could find fault, but he had an instinctive
  dislike of it.</p>

  <p>"Who is this?" he asked gruffly. "What does he want?"</p>

  <p>"Five minutes' interview was all he asked for, sir," the constable
  replied. "His face seems sort of familiar, but I have never seen him before
  that I know of. He said nothing about his business."</p>

  <p>"Show him up," was the brief command. "I don't want to see him really; I'm
  busy. Telephone me about anything you like in five minutes."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir."</p>

  <p>The visitor was duly ushered in a few minutes later. He turned out to be a
  young man of medium height, slim build, excellent carriage, blue-grey eyes of
  good quality, clean-shaven, a few freckles, and a touch of sunburn. He was
  dressed quietly but with exceedingly good taste. The Inspector grudgingly
  motioned towards a chair. His visitor, he decided, was not a person to be
  ignored.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Martin Campbell Brockenhurst," he said. "What can I do for you,
  sir?"</p>

  <p>"That's quite a long story," the other replied.</p>

  <p>"Then you'd better go and tell it to someone else," was the caustic
  answer. "This is the busiest department of Scotland Yard just now and I've no
  time to give to strangers."</p>

  <p>"I," the visitor observed, "am not a stranger."</p>

  <p>The Inspector looked at him shrewdly.</p>

  <p>"Have we ever met before?"</p>

  <p>"Once. You are not likely to remember it. It doesn't matter, anyway. I
  want a job and I can be very useful to you."</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul!" the Inspector exclaimed. "Are you crazy, man, to walk
  in here and ask an Inspector at Scotland Yard for a job? Do you know what a
  policeman, even, has to go through before he can commence regular work here?
  What sort of a job you might be wanting I can't tell. We have a first-class
  Chief Commissioner at present," he concluded, with a very obvious note of
  sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't thinking of anything so important just for the moment," the
  other replied with an unexpectedly humorous smile. "Have to work your way up
  here, as I know, Inspector&mdash;and you can work as hard as you damn well
  please sometimes, and you don't get up."</p>

  <p>The Inspector stared at his visitor.</p>

  <p>"What do you know about it?" he demanded. "You come here as a
  stranger."</p>

  <p>"Not I," was the prompt retort.</p>

  <p>"You said you came here looking for a job."</p>

  <p>"So I did, and I hope I'll get it. I've more chance now that you say you
  don't know me."</p>

  <p>The Inspector leaned a little forward in his chair.</p>

  <p>He studied his visitor more carefully. The other met his scrutiny without
  flinching. The Inspector would have hated to admit it, but he was puzzled.
  There was something familiar about this young man, so debonair in appearance,
  with an air of such confidence, but beyond that his memory failed him. The
  telephone bell rang, according to orders. He lifted the receiver with an
  irritable gesture.</p>

  <p>"Another five minutes, constable," he said. "I shall be through by
  then."</p>

  <p>"Five minutes is a very short time," the visitor said.</p>

  <p>"Get on with it, please," the Inspector begged. "I've seen you before
  somewhere. If you wanted to puzzle me, you've succeeded. I don't remember
  where. Your card tells me that you are Mr. Martin Campbell Brockenhurst, of
  Albany, Piccadilly. The name of your club may, of course, mean nothing, but
  if it is genuine it is, I believe, a very good club. What have you come here
  for, what do you want from me, and where did I see you before?"</p>

  <p>"I came to the Yard&mdash;not this department&mdash;seven years ago," the
  young man replied. "I had one ambition only in life: I wanted to be a
  detective. I found that I could only arrive at that position by serving my
  time in the ordinary Force. I served it, but when I had finished I applied
  for a job as a detective. I was put on a waiting list&mdash;I stayed on it
  for two years&mdash;then I resigned. I came into a little money and changed
  my name according to the will of the relation who left it to me. I travelled,
  returned to London, watched some of your detectives at work, and I came to
  the conclusion that, however obstinate you and your colleagues may be down
  here, you are still clever enough not to refuse a good thing. I am a good
  thing. I speak four languages, I can make myself up in seventy different
  ways, and if I am not a gentleman I have learnt to look and behave like one.
  I can wear dinner clothes, which very few of your detectives can, or I can
  wear sports clothes, which none of them can. I want to remind you also, sir,
  that I have done five years' service in the Force. You can look up my record
  and you will find it faultless. I am made up this morning so that not a soul
  here recognized me&mdash;and even you could not remember that I have sat in
  this room before. Put me on the staff."</p>

  <p>The Inspector smiled thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Campbell&mdash;P. C. Campbell you used to be. Jove, you were a sergeant,
  weren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Could have been," the young man replied, "but it wasn't what I
  wanted."</p>

  <p>The Inspector nodded.</p>

  <p>"I remember. You were a little hot-headed about this matter. I wonder, do
  you think you really have any gifts which would help you to compete with my
  trained men, beyond the fact that you can wear your clothes and have the
  tricks of better birth and education?"</p>

  <p>"I am dead certain of it," was the calm reply. "Put me on the staff, give
  me a somewhat roving commission, such as Nicky Grant used to have. Put me on
  a case when you want to, but if there is nothing doing, let me go and find a
  case of my own and work it up for you. I can't do any harm and I shall
  probably denude the criminal world of at least one malefactor."</p>

  <p>"If you go looking for them and talking like that," the Inspector
  commented, "you'll probably end in the Thames with a stone tied round your
  ankle."</p>

  <p>Again the caller smiled.</p>

  <p>"I know other languages besides those that are spoken amongst the
  criminals here or the dockside loiterers or any of those gallant strivers
  after a dishonest living," he remarked. "Would you like a little Cockney
  slang? Here goes."</p>

  <p>The Inspector stood thirty seconds of it, then he banged his fist upon the
  desk.</p>

  <p>"Shut up," he implored. "Have you ever been on the stage?"</p>

  <p>"No; but I could be any time I liked."</p>

  <p>"I believe it," the Inspector observed.</p>

  <p>The telephone rang again.</p>

  <p>"Two minutes only," the Inspector replied rather shamefacedly, hanging up
  at once.</p>

  <p>"Does that mean that you're not going to employ me?" the young man
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," the Inspector replied. "You're hired."</p>

  <p>The visitor rose to his feet. A faint smile was his only sign of
  satisfaction. He gathered together his doeskin gloves, his malacca cane, and
  his obviously Scott's hat. The Inspector, who was about the age of his
  visitor and had social ambitions, made up his mind that before long he would
  obtain from this young man the knowledge of where he purchased these
  sartorial accessories. That air of calm and easy assurance was an
  unpurchasable heritage which he knew he could never acquire.</p>

  <p>"Be here at four o'clock this afternoon," he directed his caller. "Ask for
  Inspector Mulliner, room 13 c. He will go through all your records and I
  shall also have looked you up properly by that time. I will have a talk with
  Mulliner and we will either put you on a job at once or let you do as you
  suggest&mdash;go off on your own. Before you do that I shall have a few words
  to say to you."</p>

  <p>"Delighted to look in for a chat at any time, Inspector," was the civil
  rejoinder.</p>

  <p>The Inspector scowled.</p>

  <p>"You will have to remember," he pointed out, "that there is discipline to
  be observed&mdash;discipline and nothing else around here."</p>

  <p>The young man's deportment seemed suddenly to stiffen.</p>

  <p>"You will have no fault to find with me on that score, sir," he declared
  as he prepared to take his leave.</p>

  <p>At the last moment he hesitated. He turned back to confront once more the
  Inspector's frown.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, sir," he confided, "but there is one thing I think I should
  tell you."</p>

  <p>"Be quick about it then."</p>

  <p>"During the short period that I spent in the Service as an ordinary P.
  C.," he went on, "I had just a little to do with one case which interested me
  enormously. I have never forgotten it, and I shall always remember assisting
  at the arrest of the guilty man and being in court at the time of the trial.
  This is not gossip, sir; I am telling you for a reason."</p>

  <p>"Whose case was it?" the Inspector asked with faint curiosity.</p>

  <p>"It was the case, rather famous in those days, of Simon Lebur's son,
  Richard. He was tried at the Old Bailey for the murder of a man called David
  Culpepper."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that was quite a famous case," the Inspector acknowledged. "I
  remember it perfectly. The criminal changed his plea at the last
  moment&mdash;a most unusual thing in an important case."</p>

  <p>"I felt a curiosity about certain points in that case," Martin
  Brockenhurst confided, "which has kept me guessing all this time. Then it
  happens," he went on, with a little less assurance than he had previously
  displayed, "that during my years of travel, after I came in for my money, I
  ran across one of the principal people concerned in it."</p>

  <p>"Why are you telling me this?" the Inspector asked.</p>

  <p>"Because in my spare time," Brockenhurst explained, "I should like, with
  your permission, to work on this case a little."</p>

  <p>"What earthly good could you do?" the Inspector asked. "Lebur has got
  penal servitude for life&mdash;and serve him jolly well right, I should
  think. The two men had the misfortune to share a mistress and the retreating
  lover shot his rival in the hallway of her house with his own revolver. The
  case was proved up to the hilt."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know all about that," Martin agreed. "The circumstantial evidence,
  of course, was irresistible. On the other hand, there are certain very
  curious points I should like to look into, and, if I didn't allow it to
  interfere with any other case I might be working on, I thought you wouldn't
  mind my trying to solve one problem in particular."</p>

  <p>"Waste of time, I should think," the Inspector remarked. "But provided you
  aren't too official about it and work in your own time, I don't know that I
  should have any objection. I should require a report from you, though, to be
  completed and filed with the others. I can't allow you to go working upon a
  case, even if it is one we've abandoned, entirely on your own."</p>

  <p>"That's quite understood, sir," Martin promised with a little sigh of
  relief. "I'll start work next Monday, if you're agreeable."</p>

  <p>"Whenever you like," the Inspector agreed. "Of course, I shall look upon
  you to a certain extent as a free lance, and your pay will not be on a very
  large scale."</p>

  <p>"Whatever it is, sir," Martin replied, "it will go to the Police
  Orphanage. I'm ashamed to say so, but I'm afraid I should be considered
  almost a wealthy man."</p>

  <p>"Get out, you rascal," growled the Inspector, who had not paid his income
  tax.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p>It seemed rather a curious coincidence that Lady Diana Malladene should
  have chosen the same day to open the new premises of her famous night-club as
  that on which Martin Brockenhurst rejoined that mighty army of men who do
  their best to support law and order in the great city. It was some time
  before she recognized the solitary stranger to whom her ma&icirc;tre
  d'h&ocirc;tel had given one of the best tables in the room, and even then it
  was still longer before she could believe her eyes. She sought help from one
  of her old friends, Ronnie Foster, who was reputed to know every man and
  woman in town by name, reputation, or lack of reputation. The young man in
  question was seated on a stool at the American bar, engaged in the somewhat
  melancholy consumption of a whisky and soda.</p>

  <p>"Ronnie," she said, "don't look just now, but who is that man seated by
  himself at Number Three table? He signed in as Martin Brockenhurst, but it
  can't be the Martin Brockenhurst we used to know."</p>

  <p>"God, I should hope not," was the scared reply. "I heard he'd joined the
  police and afterwards gone out to Kenya. That was a long time ago."</p>

  <p>"There are a good many of us," Diana said, pulling a little viciously at
  the petals of a flower someone had left upon the counter, "who will wish that
  he had stayed there. But I can't get away from it. I'm good at recognizing
  people, you know, and I believe that's Martin Campbell Brockenhurst."</p>

  <p>"What's he doing here?" the tired-looking young man, with crow's-feet
  about his eyes, and at that moment a somewhat startled expression, asked
  nervously.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she answered. "All I can tell you is that I shall go crazy
  in a few minutes if I don't find out whether it's he or not. Why, I was
  desperately in love with him for a week or so when we were children."</p>

  <p>"Go and ask him," her companion suggested anxiously. "You're hostess here.
  What the hell they let him in for I can't imagine, if it's he."</p>

  <p>She indulged in a little gesture of contempt.</p>

  <p>"He'd get in wherever he wanted to," she answered. "All the same, I'll go.
  If I faint, come to my assistance."</p>

  <p>"Anything you like," was the gloomy reply. "But unless he's spotted me
  already, don't tell him I'm here."</p>

  <p>There was a lull in the dancing. Diana glanced at herself for a moment in
  the mirror which she had drawn from her handbag, accepted and swallowed the
  aspirins which the barman handed to her in a silver spoon, took a long drink
  from her wineglass, and crossed the dance-floor. Brockenhurst watched her
  speculatively as she approached. He gave no sign that he expected her to
  pause at his table or address him; he just looked out at her with the bland,
  incurious regard of a polite stranger. But when she came to a standstill he
  rose slowly to his feet, knocked out his cigarette and deposited it in the
  ashtray.</p>

  <p>"Lady Diana Malladene, I believe," he said with a slight smile.</p>

  <p>"Whatever are you doing here?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"No harm, I hope," he answered. "Won't you sit down?"</p>

  <p>She sank into the place opposite to him and he resumed his seat.</p>

  <p>"No harm," she repeated, almost under her breath.</p>

  <p>"Do I look like a destroying angel?" he asked. "There was a time, wasn't
  there, when we had many mutual friends, and there was a time when we knew a
  good deal more of this side of London life, Diana, than anyone of your tender
  years&mdash;you were very young then, you know&mdash;ought to know."</p>

  <p>"You disappeared," she muttered.</p>

  <p>"I disappeared," he echoed.</p>

  <p>"Why? You were still going strong; you weren't like most of us, half
  broke."</p>

  <p>"No," he admitted thoughtfully, "it wasn't that. I'd just had enough of
  the life. I wanted something&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;cleaner."</p>

  <p>"There were a hundred different stories about you," she went on, her voice
  gradually becoming a little steadier. "Most people declared that you had gone
  to the Colonies, then a lot of people said that you were working as a farmer
  on one of your own estates. Rumours&mdash;never anything came except rumours.
  You were the mystery of the London we used to fool about in; everyone asked
  for months and even for a year after, 'What has become of Martin
  Brockenhurst?'"</p>

  <p>"Most of the time I haven't been so very far away," he assured her
  pensively.</p>

  <p>"Why did you disappear?" she asked. "Was it...?"</p>

  <p>There was a queer but commanding flash in those steel-grey eyes. She
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Not my business, of course," she murmured. "I'm sorry, Martin, but I
  couldn't help asking a question that all London asked itself for so long a
  time. It was in Ascot week, and your horse, Golden Lass, won the Gold Cup.
  You weren't there; nobody knew where you were; the Gold Cup is still in the
  safe."</p>

  <p>He looked thoughtfully ahead of him, at the gaily painted walls and the
  crowd of well-dressed visitors. Perhaps he saw farther than just across that
  heated, fashionable dance-club.</p>

  <p>"No," he reflected after a moment or two, "I wasn't so very far away. May
  I follow the custom of the place, Diana? Will you drink a glass of wine with
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Will I&mdash;? Oh, Martin, I don't think I can bear it. You know that
  this is my club&mdash;I am the hostess."</p>

  <p>"Isn't it the correct thing to do to ask your hostess to drink a glass of
  wine? Antoine," he went on, summoning the ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel who was
  standing close by, "open my bottle of wine, please. A glass for Madame."</p>

  <p>The man was swift to obey. She glanced at his own glass.</p>

  <p>"You have drunk no wine."</p>

  <p>"Not yet," he replied; "but I am going to join you now and, believe me,"
  he went on with the merest touch of sarcasm, "I may be still a very good
  customer. I have ordered and paid for a case to be kept in my locker, also a
  few bottles of what Antoine has told me is your priceless brandy."</p>

  <p>"Don't make fun of me, please," she begged, and there was something very
  human in her quiet voice and drooped eyes.</p>

  <p>"I didn't come here to do that, Diana," he assured her kindly. "Look up at
  me; you need not be afraid."</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes, but nevertheless she was afraid. It was a queer
  thing, but they drank to one another in silence and without any
  toast&mdash;it was rather difficult to find an appropriate one.</p>

  <p>"Cheer up, my dear," he enjoined, smiling. "You might be in the hands of a
  worse blackmailer. I want nothing from you; no word that I shall say will
  ever interfere with your complete and absolute freedom. You can continue with
  your bottle club, you can even crown your social success by marrying a duke,
  and my lips will always be closed. It's not you, Diana, I've come back to
  see&mdash;although if you always look as well as you do tonight a man might
  be excused for that&mdash;it's someone altogether different, and if you were
  to sit there till daylight, looking like an angel or a Delilah, you would
  never come any nearer to finding out who it is. If I ask you a few questions,
  they will be harmless ones."</p>

  <p>She drank more of her wine, pulled out her cigarette-case and lit a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"You are Martin Brockenhurst," she said, "but you are so far away. You've
  lost something, you've gained something, you've changed. I don't recognize
  you, Martin."</p>

  <p>"I have been looking at a different kind of life from a new angle," he
  told her.</p>

  <p>Diana Malladene was what all her friends called her, a clever, far-seeing,
  and shrewd young woman. That faint note of mockery in his voice penetrated
  through her senses.</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you have been doing," she begged. "Have you been hiding in
  unpeopled deserts and filling your own mind with the ghosts and shadows of
  the people you have loved and hated? You have that look, somehow."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is years," he said, "since we met, Diana, years since I have seen one
  of our old comrades, or enemies&mdash;what were they? One hardly knows. But
  during that time, I will tell you this much, I've lived amongst men and
  women; I've come closer to the real things in life than ever before."</p>

  <p>She edged her chair a little closer to his. She affected not to notice how
  the shapely brown fingers were slightly withdrawn as hers fell upon them.</p>

  <p>"No, Diana," he warned, "I am not going to tell you where I've been. If
  you find out it will be by accident, but I don't think you will find out.
  There are a few questions I shall ask you, and then good-night."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You may ask questions, then, and I may not?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he rejoined, "on reflection you will admit that I have the
  better right."</p>

  <p>"As usual," she sighed, "you make me feel like a squirming child at a
  board-school. Who gave you the rod of the master always, Martin?"</p>

  <p>"The rod," he answered, "exists only in the guilty mind of the listener. I
  have nothing to speak of against you, Diana. You are still, I should think,
  the most beautiful woman in London."</p>

  <p>She leaned back a little in her chair and looked at him steadily.</p>

  <p>"I am trying to imagine that you are some famous portrait painter," she
  said, "and I am myself. At any rate, I am glad I wore this particular frock
  tonight."</p>

  <p>"Oyster pink," he murmured.</p>

  <p>She bowed.</p>

  <p>"I thank you for the memory."</p>

  <p>"It is a beautiful colour," he went on, "and you are a beautiful woman.
  Quite as beautiful as you were when a certain picture of you was
  painted."</p>

  <p>"Have you come back to tell me that once more?" she asked, lifting her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I am not that much of a fool," he said quietly. "I can come back or go
  forth to gloat again on the beauty of the Fra Lippo Lippi Madonna, and I
  should find it as beautiful as it seemed to me twenty years ago. The eyes of
  every passer-by who knew what beauty was loved her, but she has not
  changed."</p>

  <p>"It appears to me," Lady Diana said, opening her bag and taking out her
  mirror, "that this would be a very good place for a hiatus in our
  conversation. You have told me that I am still beautiful; that is all that
  matters. My skin I know is flawless, my eyes have that little glint of the
  violet in their blue, and the arts of the coiffeur would only be wasted on my
  yellow hair. I have survived time&mdash;one triumph at any rate, Martin. So
  have you, for that matter; but you didn't come here to mix words with
  me."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I came here," he confided, "to learn something of the lives of a few of
  those who were our friends years ago."</p>

  <p>"To do them mischief?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps."</p>

  <p>"And why should you think that I would help you?"</p>

  <p>"I thought you might," he admitted, lighting a cigarette for himself, but
  also watching her. "There are reasons, you know, Diana, why, when I ask you
  in a pleasant and submissive manner, it would be almost better if you yielded
  to my simple request."</p>

  <p>"There's one simple request," she said, "I should love to make."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Dance with me for a few minutes."</p>

  <p>He smiled enigmatically but certainly without distaste, then he laid down
  his cigarette and bowed.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>They danced. She with the gracious sensuousness of the born
  <i>danseuse</i>, he with a sort of grim faultlessness of posture and movement
  that was yet in its way admirable. Now and then he leaned a little to the
  music and at such moments her eyes, lifted to his, shone with almost feverish
  eloquence. At the end of the dance he led her to her place, filled her glass
  with wine, pushed the cigarettes towards her and lit one himself.</p>

  <p>"You always dance like that," she said. "If I had been a light woman or
  you had been in any way serious, what a nuisance I should have been to
  you."</p>

  <p>"Nuisances are of different sorts," he said. "Now I am going to ask you a
  question."</p>

  <p>"Do you think I don't know what it is?" she asked, lighting another
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Broke to the world. No good coming here to look for him. They would never
  let him in."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that one," he remarked. "I know all about Henry Guest, Diana. You
  see, I can utter his name quite calmly. He is, as you say, broke. Isn't that
  Ronnie Foster at the bar?"</p>

  <p>The man on the stool caught Martin's eye, slipped to his feet and strolled
  across to them. Diana welcomed him with a friendly nod. He made no attempt to
  shake hands with the new member of the club, but he summoned up the ghost of
  a welcoming smile.</p>

  <p>"So you're back in these parts again, Brockenhurst," he remarked. "Glad to
  see you, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much," the other replied. "London, as I am seeing it
  tonight, is a new city to me. Later in the week you must dine with me,
  Diana," he invited, rising to his feet, "and tell me about a few more of our
  old friends. I have a very small apartment at the Albany. I suppose I can
  find your name in the telephone book?"</p>

  <p>"Berkeley 6699," she told him. "Don't ring up too early, Martin."</p>

  <p>"It would give me great pleasure if you would dine with me on Tuesday
  evening. All our old places have gone, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"The Milan still retains its popularity," Ronnie Foster remarked.</p>

  <p>"Let it be the Milan, then," Martin suggested.</p>

  <p>"At half-past eight in the foyer?"</p>

  <p>"I shall be there," he promised.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p>The commissionaire's whistle shrilled up the street and a moment or two
  later a Rolls-Royce coup&eacute; was driven noiselessly to the entrance in
  obedience to its summons. Brockenhurst motioned to the chauffeur to get out.
  The man, dressed in a quiet, black livery, stood at attention; he neither
  saluted nor spoke. Brockenhurst pointed to the empty seat.</p>

  <p>"I will drop you at the Albany," he said. "See that the garage door is
  left closed, but unlocked. I may be late."</p>

  <p>The man's salute was more like an Oriental bow than a Cockney chauffeur's
  gesture, but he made no remark, took his seat, folded his arms, and preserved
  unbroken silence. He was by no means a striking-looking person, but he had
  the yellow complexion and the narrow, black eyes of the Oriental. There was
  also a complete vacancy of expression which only the Orientals can obtain. He
  slipped from his place at the Albany, turned gravely towards his master,
  bowed and disappeared in the direction of a neighbouring garage. Brockenhurst
  turned slowly round, drove down St. James's Street, crossed the Park, and
  when he reached the Embankment, turned to the left and slackened speed. A few
  yards away from an empty seat he drew up and stopped his engine. He leaned
  over the side of the car and looked steadfastly up and down the river. A few
  yards higher up were some worn and disused steps, leading down to the
  water.</p>

  <p>A certain rigidity of expression left him. He produced his cigarette-case,
  selected a cigarette, tapped it lightly on the panelwork and lit it with the
  aid of a small gold lighter. The Embankment was now nearly empty. At its far
  extremity he paused and slowly brought the car to a standstill. Here was a
  coffee-stall, an old man behind it cutting slices from a loaf of bread, two
  great containers of fizzling coffee, and a little half-starved crowd of men
  and women hanging around, nearly all with the same destitute expression which
  hunger and thirst had graven upon their faces. Brockenhurst got out of his
  coup&eacute; and strolled over to the counter. He walked quietly and without
  the least touch of arrogance in his bearing. Nevertheless there was a strange
  look on the faces of some of the loiterers as they watched him.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Joe," he greeted the old man behind the bar.</p>

  <p>The man glanced at him but did not pause in his task of cutting up the
  loaf.</p>

  <p>"So you knows me, Guvnor," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I was a customer years ago," Brockenhurst told him.</p>

  <p>The man shot a warning glance at the newcomer. The latter's coat was
  buttoned up to his throat, he was wearing a muffler, and his hat was one of
  the soft black homburgs which have taken the place of more offensive night
  wear, but his voice had just that touch of refinement which is calculated to
  annoy the owner of an empty stomach.</p>

  <p>"I'm an old customer, Joe, and I am standing treat," he continued. "Serve
  out all you can and as quickly as you can. Gentlemen, and you, ladies," he
  added, lifting his hat as two flamboyantly dressed young women joined the
  gathering, "pray accept the hospitality of an old patron of Joe here. Get to
  work, my friend," he went on, turning to the man behind the counter. "You can
  add it up afterwards."</p>

  <p>Joe grinned as he obeyed orders.</p>

  <p>"There's something about yer voice, sir," he admitted, "that comes home to
  me. I'll grant yer that. Yer wouldn't be the first one of my old customers
  that struck it rich and come back to see old Joe. There was a policeman once
  on this beat who talked a bit like you."</p>

  <p>"Never mind who I am," his generous patron enjoined him; "get on with
  serving the stuff. It's beginning to rain, and you don't want to have your
  customers getting wet through, waiting for their food. Here, give me that
  knife and fork; I'll cut up the ham for you."</p>

  <p>With his cigarette a little in the side of his mouth and his hat, through
  contact with one or two others, a little on the back of his head,
  Brockenhurst carved up a ham with a speed and dexterity almost unbelievable.
  He piled it on to the top of the bread as fast as Joe could cut it. Suddenly
  the latter slackened in his work.</p>

  <p>"It isn't a wise thing you're doing, you know, Guvnor," he warned him,
  leaning over the counter. "They've got their eye on you, some of these chaps.
  It's a pity you let 'em see that notecase."</p>

  <p>Martin Brockenhurst grinned pleasantly. The expression with which he had
  looked into the black waters of the river had vanished.</p>

  <p>"I don't think there's one of your customers would stick a knife into the
  back of their host, Joe," he said. "Besides, I've spent a winter or two in
  Chicago, and this place is a kid's toyland compared with that."</p>

  <p>"Chicago," one of the loiterers on the outside of the circle repeated.
  "Are you a gunman then, Guvnor?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't my profession exactly," Martin answered, glancing round with a
  good-humoured smile, "but I did take a few lessons in Chicago. I'm handy with
  a knife&mdash;see this."</p>

  <p>With a sudden twist of his wrist the knife with which he had been cutting
  the ham flashed up into the air. There was a startled little cry amongst the
  crowd. In a second or two it came glittering down, a straight line of steel
  with the oil-lamp of the stall flashing upon it as it passed. The two girls
  screamed, the men were stupefied. Brockenhurst was continuing to cut the ham
  with the fork nicely balanced in his right hand and the knife in his
  left.</p>

  <p>"It's a good trick that, you know," he said, continuing his task. "I had a
  few lessons from an American juggler&mdash;at least, he was an American by
  birth but he'd learnt his tricks in the Philippines. The catching of the
  knife coming down is easy enough, if you give it the right twist in the
  throw, but you've got to be devilish quick to change and get the knife in
  your left hand and the fork in the right when you've finished, though I'm
  better with a gun, perhaps."</p>

  <p>"My God, Guvnor, you're hot stuff," one of the men growled from the
  outside of the crowd. "If I were one of the larky 'uns, like young Samuel
  here, and out for making summat on the push-push, you're the sort of gent I
  should leave alone."</p>

  <p>"Who're you calling one of the larky 'uns?" his companion grunted
  menacingly. "As for the gent here, I can see it in 'is eye that 'e's going to
  'and round a bob or two for us to get a can of beer or a drop of the hot
  stuff at the widow's."</p>

  <p>"Hear, hear," someone in the crowd declared with enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm afraid, my young friend," Martin regretted, throwing the ham
  bone, from which he had stripped every handful of meat, to a hungry dog who
  was skulking round, "that you've got it wrong. I'm not quite that sort of a
  mug. There's a pound or two of tobacco there," he added, pointing to the
  shelves. "Hand it out, Joe&mdash;you're welcome to that; but no money passes
  except between Joe and me."</p>

  <p>"What about us?" the girls cried, pushing their way towards him. "We can't
  eat baccy. You drive us home in that motorcar of yours, Guvnor, and we'll
  give you a drop of the real stuff, all free and for nothing. It's nothing but
  a step or two."</p>

  <p>"Alas," Martin regretted, "tonight I am unable to accept your hospitality,
  dear ladies. I came to have a little private conversation with my friend Joe,
  but I have met so many old friends that the time has passed over-quickly.
  Hand out your stuff, Joe," he went on, turning to the owner of the stall.
  "Let 'em have the tobacco and fix your price for the lot. I want a word in
  your ear."</p>

  <p>Joe scratched his head.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth, Guvnor," he confessed, "you're fairly making me
  dizzy with all this adding up."</p>

  <p>"We'll cut it short," Brockenhurst suggested. "Threepence each you said
  for the sandwiches. Well, there aren't more than a hundred of them, we'll say
  thirty shillings for that. Now, how about the ham?"</p>

  <p>Joe leaned forward with his elbows upon the stall.</p>

  <p>"That there ham, Guvnor," he declared earnestly, "cost me a sovereign and
  a half if it cost me a penny. I could have made fourpence on the bone, too,
  any day."</p>

  <p>"Joe, my friend," his customer said reprovingly, "you are getting
  grasping. A man of your generosity and disposition should never rob the dog
  of its bone. We'll say four shillings for the bone, though&mdash;it was worth
  that to the dog. Now, you can't have served more than a hundred cups of
  coffee at tuppence&mdash;what about a fiver for the lot?"</p>

  <p>The man squeezed himself an inch or two farther forward; his voice was
  hoarse with anxiety.</p>

  <p>"I say it's a go, Guvnor," he agreed. "But for the love of Mike, keep that
  notecase of yours hidden. That's Tim Jordan in the background, the old
  middle-weight, you know, and that's Slimpy Dick whispering to him. Those
  other two were bad enough, but that Jordan, he's a killer; he'd kill a man
  for what you've got in that notecase."</p>

  <p>"He won't kill me," was the confident reply. "There's the fiver, Joe. And
  good luck to you," he added.</p>

  <p>He withdrew the fiver from the case without ostentation but with no
  attempt at secrecy. Then he laid an insistent forefinger on Joe's hand.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Joe," he confided, "I want a piece of information from you."</p>

  <p>"Gawd! This isn't police work, is it?" the stall-keeper gasped.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it," was the scornful reply. "The piece of information I
  want won't bring any harm to anybody. I want to know what has become of Sarah
  Rose."</p>

  <p>It was a warm night, with mists blowing off the river, but it was not warm
  enough to account for the sweat on Joe's forehead. He groaned audibly, his
  voice seemed blocked with some undescribable emotion.</p>

  <p>"Gawd, Guvnor," he muttered, "you come here and ask me that! And you
  dressed like a prince, too, and a pocket-book full of notes, one of which
  would have saved that girl. I dunno, sir, I dunno where she is."</p>

  <p>The man whom he had referred to as Tim Jordan and his friend Slimpy Dick
  were peering into the interior of the coup&eacute;. The girls, too, were
  standing looking at it; one of them caressing the mascot, but Martin was
  apparently taking no notice of them.</p>

  <p>"You'd better try and remember, Joe," he suggested quietly. "Now let me
  put it plainly to you&mdash;there's a hundred pounds for news of that girl
  and there's a police cell for anyone who knows and keeps his mouth shut."</p>

  <p>Joe sank down on to his stool.</p>

  <p>"I believe you're nothing but a bloody dick, still," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Bloody dicks don't have a hundred pounds to offer," Martin said quietly.
  "I won't tell you why, Joe, for it's not your concern, but I want that
  girl."</p>

  <p>"Girl! She was a lady, she was," Joe scowled. "She was as good as the
  likes of you for all your motorcar and your banknotes, Guvnor. Put that in
  yer pipe and smoke it."</p>

  <p>Brockenhurst raised his hat.</p>

  <p>"That may have been so," he agreed. "I salute her. I wish no harm to her,
  but I want to know where she is, Joe."</p>

  <p>"You want her to tell you what she knows and nobody else knows," the old
  man cried savagely. "You want to ruin all that she's given her life for. I
  was something of a scholar before I came down in the world, young man. I knew
  something of France; I've read books. Did you ever hear of Joan of Arc?"</p>

  <p>"I have," Martin admitted.</p>

  <p>"She was a Joan of Arc," Joe declared, "and not for your damned lettercase
  or your bloody car would I lift a finger to help you find her. She's earned
  all she's got and that's all there is to it."</p>

  <p>Martin stood quite still for a moment or two, watching the man's face. It
  was a queer position, his. He had had his own way with men most of his life,
  with men and women too. He had learned the trick of bending them to his will;
  he was used to success. This man's attitude, the stubborn rigidity of his
  words and expression, inspired him with a new sensation; he was brought up
  against failure, or at least temporary failure. Here, at this shabby,
  weather-beaten stall, with its torn tarpaulin top, its shaky wooden supports,
  its boards stained with the spilt libations of years&mdash;failure. Somehow
  or other it seemed to give him a fresh zest in life. It was a new sensation.
  He leaned over and patted the old man on the shoulder. The latter looked up
  wonderingly. He asked no question, but it was obvious that his anger was
  passing away, giving place to a growing curiosity.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to bother you any more this morning, Joe," his visitor
  promised. "I may come back again or I may see if I can find out all that I
  want to know without your help."</p>

  <p>Joe's expression suddenly changed. He thrust his hand into his pocket and
  there was something gleaming between his worn fingers with their broken
  nails, something that looked uncommonly like a police whistle.</p>

  <p>"You'd better look after yourself, Guvnor," he advised quickly; "they'll
  be off with your car in a moment."</p>

  <p>Martin swung round. Mr. Tim Jordan had taken up an aggressive attitude in
  front of the car. His friend Slimpy Dick was inside, struggling with the
  self-starter. Four or five of the others of the crowd were hanging round, but
  most of them had hurried off with their gifts. The girls were undecided. They
  were hesitating whether to side with the gent and to stand being half-beaten
  to death by Tim Jordan and his friend or to jump into the car. They were
  saved from a painful decision by the swift development of events. Joe's
  police whistle was blowing and the gent, with half a dozen rapid paces, was
  standing before Jordan.</p>

  <p>"Get out of the way," he ordered, "and you fellow in there, get out of my
  car."</p>

  <p>That was the moment when for ever Tim Jordan lost his position as cock
  amongst the bullies of Swan Alley on the other side of the bridge towards
  Bermondsey. The way it happened was almost too quick for comprehension, but
  in less than thirty seconds Jordan was lying in the gutter, Slimpy Dick had
  been dragged out of the car and thrown half-way across the causeway, and the
  car, as though obedient to its owner, obeyed the touch of his forefinger and
  was ticking away harmoniously.</p>

  <p>"Good night to all of you," Martin called out, looking out of the window.
  "Better make yourselves scarce or I may have to see you at Bow Street."</p>

  <p>There were half a dozen policemen hurrying from different directions.
  Martin and his car had disappeared.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p>Inspector Charlesworth brushed away from his desk the papers he had been
  studying, drew his chair a little forward, and welcomed his visitor with, for
  him, a reasonable amount of cordiality.</p>

  <p>"How are you, young fellow?" he asked. "I thought it was about time you
  brought us in a report."</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"Not much doing in the world of crime, Inspector," he observed in a
  depressed tone. "I answered your enquiries about Lady Diana Malladene's
  bottle party, didn't I?"</p>

  <p>"You seem to think that she's kept within the bounds of the law."</p>

  <p>"Everything was correct while I was there, at any rate, and I stayed
  late," was the reassuring reply. "It's the Law that's so stupid about these
  places. Why does it allow men or women to pitch upon an unlicensed room and,
  because they bring the stuff in, open a drinking-den? It's absolutely easy to
  keep it legal, but why does the law that makes it legal exist?"</p>

  <p>"So long as there are a certain class of people who want that sort of
  thing," his superior officer pointed out, "it will continue to exist. Our
  prisons aren't large enough to receive all the men and women in the West End,
  young and old, who want to dance and drink a glass of wine after hours.
  Anyway, it's not our job to purify the city. It's the people who make the
  laws who must do that. Our job, the laws being established, is to keep people
  inside the boundary as well as we can."</p>

  <p>Martin nodded and passed over a sheet of paper to his chief.</p>

  <p>"There are three other cases," he announced, "which should be looked into,
  and there is a disorderly house in Smith Street which is an open scandal.
  They boast that they are sheltered by the police, and I should advise you to
  have a certain Superintendent Crisp watched and deprived of his post, as he
  certainly should be."</p>

  <p>"Nephew of the Deputy Commissioner," the Inspector muttered. "That comes
  of employing new brooms, you sweep too damn clean sometimes."</p>

  <p>"I leave it to you, sir," Martin rejoined dryly. "I haven't made a formal
  report myself. I simply tell you what you can find out if you care to. I am
  still working on the case which is my special hobby in my spare time."</p>

  <p>The Inspector looked thoughtfully across those few feet of space between
  him and his visitor.</p>

  <p>"You're a persistent man, aren't you?" he observed, and it seemed as if
  there was almost a faint note of uneasiness in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," Martin replied, "Scotland Yard has its list of famous
  criminals, most of whom have been brought to book and passed on. There is one
  amongst them, however, the most infamous of all from my point of view, who
  has not yet received his deserts and whom I believe to be still alive. That's
  why I stick to the Lebur tragedy."</p>

  <p>"You never find a shred of encouragement anywhere?" the Inspector
  enquired.</p>

  <p>Martin leaned a little further back in his chair, his eyes passed over the
  Inspector's head, he seemed to be looking intently at a blank space in the
  wall.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not, sir," he admitted, "and yet I have my fancies. Every now and
  then there comes a whisper in my ear from someone, the whisper of someone or
  other I come across. The whisper seems entirely a reluctant one, the man or
  the woman who has grudgingly vouchsafed it gets out of my sight as soon as
  they can&mdash;and yet, I am convinced that there is a purpose in every one
  of them."</p>

  <p>"Go on," the Inspector invited.</p>

  <p>"They try to lead me down blind alleys," Martin confided. "They are all
  out for getting me worked up on some false clue, and if I were to follow it
  right out to the end I should find something there which would probably mean
  the end of me and the man for whom I am working would die in his prison after
  all. It's the obvious falseness of these clues, if you understand me, sir,"
  the visitor concluded, "which intrigues me. I may be wrong, but they seem to
  me as though they were meant for pitfalls."</p>

  <p>"Well, be careful," Inspector Charlesworth advised. "If you'd only settle
  down to your work you might easily become one of the most important men in
  this establishment, Martin. It's just because you fasten upon a case like
  this and refuse to accept a reasonable verdict about it that your progress
  gets blocked now and then. If I were you I should leave your hobby alone. We
  have a man working here on the premises with two secretaries and all the help
  we can give him, who is compiling a history of the famous crimes which have
  been committed during the last ten years. I had a chat with him only a few
  nights ago, and he told me that so far as he had gone&mdash;and he is nearing
  the end of his task&mdash;there is not a single one of the famous criminals
  who deserves one grain of sympathy. There is not one case in which a
  reasonable doubt exists as to the actual guilt of the man or woman who has
  been found guilty. He is calling it 'The Inevitability of the Law,' or
  something of that sort. Go and talk with him some time. He's up in room No.
  18 when he works here, which is three days a week, and the rest of the time
  he works at his own home in Lincoln's Inn. Professor John P. Mason is his
  name, his records are kept even more scientifically than ours, because he has
  a study of the motive as well as a copy of the evidence. You'd find him
  interesting, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>Martin picked up his hat.</p>

  <p>"I'll look him up some day," he promised. "Meanwhile, I'll report whenever
  you send for me, Inspector."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>That night Martin kept his engagement and dined with Diana Malladene. The
  young lady, who possessed intuition as well as good taste, appeared in a
  perfectly plain black frock which followed the lines of her figure with
  almost indecent accuracy. She wore no jewellery, only a narrow band of black
  velvet at her throat. She watched Martin's eyes as she approached almost
  anxiously and breathed a sigh of relief as she noticed a glint of
  approval.</p>

  <p>"Such trouble with my frock," she confided, as she strolled down the broad
  steps by his side towards the corner which he had selected. "Madame
  L&eacute;onie came round herself to insist upon some alterations, but I
  wouldn't have them."</p>

  <p>"So far as mere man might criticize," he replied, "I should say that you
  have achieved perfection."</p>

  <p>She breathed a little sigh of content.</p>

  <p>"Madame had the impertinence to tell me that, so far as my gown went,
  although I designed it myself, I was offering a perfect replica of the
  Shaftesbury Avenue street-walker."</p>

  <p>"L&eacute;onie is not always to be relied upon," he observed. "I remember
  a green dress she made for you once that was as near perfection as any dress
  could be, but she forgot altogether in blending the shades of the material
  that little glint of the snake in your eyes. She couldn't see it; she never
  would see it until I sent her to the Leicester Galleries to study McEvoy's
  picture of you. Then she tried to get the dress back, but she was too
  late."</p>

  <p>She looked at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Martin," she exclaimed, "you're incredible, you're absolutely impossible.
  She made me that dress eight years ago and you have lived through hurricanes
  since then. Why should you remember anything about a particular dress of
  mine?"</p>

  <p>"It's odd," he admitted, taking up the menu, "what queer things lurk in
  the corners of one's memory."</p>

  <p>She shivered a little and almost snatched her vodka from the salver which
  the waiter was offering.</p>

  <p>"It's uncanny," she muttered. "How many things like that do you remember,
  I wonder?"</p>

  <p>"I have never learned," he said calmly, as he toyed with his own
  wineglass, "the gift of forgetfulness. Mind you, it is a wonderful gift,
  Diana. Of course, I think the most important thing for anyone to search for
  in this life would be happiness; but if I were fool enough ever to set myself
  the definite task of attaining happiness, I should first of all demand that
  the cells of memory were closed in my mind."</p>

  <p>"But this is horrible!" she exclaimed. "I can't live up to my part,
  Martin, if you're going to talk in that fashion all the evening. I know
  nothing of psychology, I don't care a bit how the world is run or by whom;
  all I ask is that things should turn out as I want them. I was flattered,
  although I was tremendously puzzled, when you asked me to dine tonight. There
  is no one in the world I'm prouder to be seen with, and I have another
  failing that I shall never mention to you as long as I live and that you will
  never know about&mdash;but if you're going to talk like that I shall say
  let's make it an early evening. I can't live up to it, Martin&mdash;not a
  hope. Everyone calls me clever, don't they? Well, I'm not. I'm cunning and it
  doesn't get me very far. I haven't the brains for your sort of mental
  philandering."</p>

  <p>"Well, you've put me nicely in my place to start the evening," Martin
  observed. "Whom do you think I had a little conversation with last
  night?"</p>

  <p>"That's better. Let's talk about our old pals."</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether you'd call this one exactly a pal," Martin
  reflected. "It was old Joe, of the Embankment coffee-stall."</p>

  <p>"That old mummy." She laughed. "Is he still alive?"</p>

  <p>"I should say he was."</p>

  <p>"What were you doing at the coffee-stall?" she asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Wait," he begged. "We haven't ordered dinner."</p>

  <p>"Well," she remarked, carefully studying the menu, "there are none of your
  disclosures which could spoil my appetite. I am beginning to get quite used
  to the idea, Martin, that you are back in London and that one is likely to
  run up against you at any of these places. As regards our dinner, since we've
  anticipated with the vodka, I think we'd better have just a little
  caviare."</p>

  <p>"And afterwards," he suggested, "a sole Marguery and a quail. A
  souffl&eacute; or maybe strawberries to finish with."</p>

  <p>She sighed with content.</p>

  <p>"I must say you know how to feed a greedy girl, Martin," she observed.
  "You always did."</p>

  <p>"Only," he remarked suavely, "I hadn't always the money, had I? I lost a
  good many picturesque acquaintances through being poor."</p>

  <p>"I often wonder," she speculated, "why you had so few friends."</p>

  <p>"Friends are scarcely worth having," he rejoined. "They always disappoint
  one."</p>

  <p>"Cynic," she scoffed.</p>

  <p>"If ever you take to yourself a friend you lay up for yourself
  disappointment. Did I tell you why I went down to see Joe?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head a little distastefully.</p>

  <p>"Why bring in that old horror? It makes me sick even to think of his foul
  fingernails and broken teeth."</p>

  <p>"And yet there were times," he reminded her, "when you sat on his stool
  and munched his sandwiches, drank his coffee and turned up your nose at a
  banquet like this. Just through that split piece of his canvas we used to
  watch for the line of daylight."</p>

  <p>"One had slight reactions towards vulgarity sometimes," she remarked.
  "Life gets too finely drawn. It doesn't last long; one comes back to the
  &aelig;sthetic almost automatically. Now tell me, why did you go?"</p>

  <p>"I went to ask him if he could tell me what had become of Sarah Rose."</p>

  <p>The strains of the Merry Widow Waltz floated across to where they were
  seated. The girl wondered long afterwards whether it was a fit of kindness or
  simply an effort of good taste which made him suddenly absorbed in the music.
  He hummed it softly, his eyes upon the conductor. A harsh voice across the
  table almost startled him.</p>

  <p>"Who was Sarah Rose?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Just a woman of the streets," he admitted, "concerning whose fate I had
  some slight curiosity."</p>

  <p>"Why?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"It isn't a pleasant story," he told her gently. "I don't know why I
  mentioned the girl's name."</p>

  <p>"Well, was your curiosity satisfied?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least. Perhaps he was telling the truth, perhaps he was lying
  through fear, or perhaps he was bribed to lie. At any rate, I came away no
  wiser than I went."</p>

  <p>"Come and dance and forget all about the sort of girl who hangs about
  Joe's stall," she begged.</p>

  <p>"Dance," he echoed. "Listen to the music, Diana. We'll dance the Merry
  Widow&mdash;and that will be wonderful."</p>

  <p>They strolled to the dance-floor like any other couple, Diana Malladene
  recovered from her momentary fit of nerves, Martin Brockenhurst, as always,
  imperturbable. With set mien and full of courteous deference to his partner,
  he led her to her place afterwards, but she did not immediately sink into her
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Martin," she begged, looking across at him, "please&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He nodded and patted her hand with a little smile of reassurance.</p>

  <p>"You make me feel like the barbarous barrister," he declared. "Quite
  right, Diana, I've been a brute. Finish your dinner in peace and comfort and
  let's talk about the people who have some importance in the world&mdash;your
  father, for instance. They tell me that he's certainly for the Woolsack.
  Fancy having a father who is Lord High Chancellor of England and who is
  beloved by everybody!"</p>

  <p>"Father is desperately popular," she murmured, with a glint of affection
  in her eyes. "Don't you think he's broad-minded, Martin, to let me run a
  night-club as a hobby?"</p>

  <p>"I do, indeed," he agreed. "I wonder what it feels like," he went on,
  smiling, "to be loved by everyone. That's a state I shall never arrive
  at."</p>

  <p>"You can't be sure," she told him. "You could be if you changed a
  little&mdash;you're too broody, you know, Martin. You're so aloof, you're
  like Hamlet, all the time making speeches about things that don't really
  matter."</p>

  <p>"Shades of Bernard Shaw," he muttered, "what about that
  souffl&eacute;?"</p>

  <p>"You know me," Diana sighed, "the right souffl&eacute; is a thing I've
  never refused in my life. You know, I was popular once, Martin," she went on.
  "They used to call me the girl everyone loved&mdash;that is, my friends."</p>

  <p>"We all love you now," he assured her. "I do, especially."</p>

  <p>There was the slightest possible tremble in her lips. He noticed it and
  wondered.</p>

  <p>"There was another nice lad in my days; he must be quite grown up now,
  Ginger Brown they used to call him. He was a gunner."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Ginger," she sighed. "Didn't you know, Martin? I married him."</p>

  <p>"Of course I didn't know," he assured her. "I'm sorry, Diana. Have I made
  a <i>faux pas</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," she replied. "There was never very much sentiment about it,
  I'm afraid. He lost his head one night and I liked him just well enough. Our
  divorce case was quite a distinguished affair: no lurid details that anyone
  could grumble at, a quiet elopement for love's sake on the part of Ginger. A
  solemn case; I wore black and white, and I have a very nice little sum of
  pocket-money coming every quarter, which pays for my cigarettes at any
  rate."</p>

  <p>A party of young people suddenly surrounded their table. There was a
  volley of incoherent introductions, everyone began talking very fast,
  speaking about vague absentees, every one of whom they called by their
  Christian names or nicknames. A few of them remembered Brockenhurst in a
  vague sort of manner.</p>

  <p>"Africa, wasn't it, you disappeared to?" one man asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have been in Africa for some time," Brockenhurst assented.</p>

  <p>"I thought it was the Far East," a girl remarked. "Surely a cousin of mine
  met you in Singapore?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have also been in Singapore. I was there last March," Martin
  admitted.</p>

  <p>He felt a touch on his arm. A little dark woman, almost old enough to have
  been the chaperone of the party, looked up at him, smiling.</p>

  <p>"At least," she asked, "you remember me, I trust, Mr. Brockenhurst?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Comtesse," he replied, bowing over her fingers, "I believe we are
  almost related, are we not?"</p>

  <p>"You look so horribly young," she answered, "that I am ashamed to confess
  it, but I am your godmother."</p>

  <p>"Don't I know it," he replied. "You were at the ch&acirc;teau near Mougins
  when I was born and you came there when I was a kid."</p>

  <p>"And afterwards," she told him, "I visited you at that preparatory school
  for Eton where you were."</p>

  <p>He offered her his chair, but she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I have this young crowd to look after," she explained. "Lady Julia comes
  of age in three days' time and she's going to be married then. You know her
  future husband, of course&mdash;Dick Foljambes, in the Lancers."</p>

  <p>"Too much my junior, I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>"We may meet later on," the woman remarked pleasantly. "I think these
  children mean to make a night of it. <i>Au revoir.</i>"</p>

  <p>The little party drifted away. Diana Malladene watched their disappearance
  with speculative eyes.</p>

  <p>"Some of them will turn up at my place later on, I expect," she remarked
  hopefully.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"They look as though they were out for a night of it. Be careful, Diana;
  keep within the law. I can't see how you can possibly make enough out of it
  to run the risks you do."</p>

  <p>"It isn't only the drink, Martin," she confessed. "I get a hundred per
  cent. for that, of course, but that isn't all."</p>

  <p>He looked at her curiously.</p>

  <p>"You don't serve many dinners," he remarked. "Those tiny little suppers
  can't bring you in much profit."</p>

  <p>"I lose money by them," she assured him.</p>

  <p>"Then how else do you make money out of the place?" he asked bluntly.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid of you, Martin," she told him, lowering her voice a little.
  "You're such a mysterious person. You wouldn't get me into trouble wilfully,
  I'm sure. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, get on with it, Diana."</p>

  <p>"I can't," she admitted. "I look at you, I remember who you are, and I am
  afraid."</p>

  <p>"Afraid of me?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Of you."</p>

  <p>"Quite right," he said, looking at her steadily. "I've changed my ideas
  since the old times. You'd better tell me if you're outstepping the bounds
  and I'll help to put you back again."</p>

  <p>"Allah preserve me from being such a fool," she mocked. "All that I say,
  Martin, is keep away from the 'Evening Star.' It isn't the place for you. If
  I get into trouble, it's my own account. I've gone too far to turn back and I
  don't want serious people like you about the place."</p>

  <p>"It isn't necessary for me to remind you, I suppose," he went on after a
  moment's pause, "that the days of the ordinary dress-coated detective from
  Scotland Yard, whose shirt bulged and who even stooped sometimes to a made-up
  tie, are over."</p>

  <p>She laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>"I have three door-men, as I call them," she confided, "and I never knew
  one of them make a mistake yet. Do you mind, Martin?" she added, as she shut
  her bag with a little click, glanced at her watch, and rose to her feet.
  "I've loved our dinner. I'd give anything in the world," she went on, as her
  hand rested for a moment in his, "for a few really kind words from you, for
  even a glint of that old light in your eyes, and for just a little less
  mystery. It's no good hoping, I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>He stood still for a moment. It seemed as though he was really considering
  the idea of taking her seriously. His reply when he made it, however, was
  quite indefinite.</p>

  <p>"The mystery," he reminded her, "comes from you. Only the advice from me.
  And," he concluded impressively, "the advice is&mdash;chuck it."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p>There is a certain evening light much beloved by artists who go in for
  indoor work and who do not disdain the aid of uncovered windows and the faint
  deference to conventionality which has a strangely searching effect upon the
  figures in modern canvasses and in the lines and expressions of human faces.
  No one knew this better than the girl who had turned away from her unfinished
  canvas to sit and gaze for long minutes out of the plain, uncurtained window
  towards the skyline, northwards. The departed sun seemed to have left behind
  some remnant of his lurid farewell in the distant skies. There was for a few
  minutes a fine light upon her delicate face, the slightly uplifted, pointed
  chin, the dark brown eyes from which the fervour of work had departed but
  upon which the faint joy of recent creation was still lingering. Perhaps,
  too, it displayed more keenly than any other light those lines of sorrow
  which gave her head that melancholy droop, which had drawn the girlish
  softness from her lips and then made sudden atonement in that Madonna-like
  sweetness which only sorrow can give. There was a figure in the background
  whom as yet she had not noticed, and he stood there almost without breathing,
  fascinated by the wonderful picture. Already that light was fading, so soon
  it would be lost, and with it the most poignant emotion he had ever felt
  since the blast of tragedy had prematurely turned a high-spirited lad into
  the tragical figure of a sorrowing man....</p>

  <p>A few more seconds and it was passing. The girl, utterly unconscious both
  of that rapt, almost reverential scrutiny and the fading of the light which
  had shone down upon her face, rose slowly to her feet. She pulled down the
  ivory knob of the blind, she touched the electric-light switch, but her
  fingers, which would have strayed to the bell, seemed to have become suddenly
  paralyzed. She drew a step back and looked at her uninvited guest.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It seems strange that you should ever need to ask me that," he replied.
  "Here I am, Pamela, an unbidden visitor. I feel that I have broken in upon a
  sacred dream. If I did not know that you scorn the arts of the poseurs, I
  should have decided that you were sitting there in the light he loved, the
  grey sad light that broods over <i>Firenze</i>, and trying to charm Andrea
  del Sarto back to life again to finish your picture for you."</p>

  <p>"It is you, then, Martin, really?" she exclaimed, moving a step forward.
  "At first you frightened me. You were so much like a dream picture, yourself.
  What am I to say to you?"</p>

  <p>"Welcome," he replied as he moved towards her.</p>

  <p>"Welcome it shall be then," she assented gently. "I shall stoop down from
  the sublime into which you have exalted me to the ridiculous. I shall ring
  for tea."</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment," he begged. "This moment is too tense to break. You are
  not angry with me?"</p>

  <p>"I could not be," she answered, shaking her head gravely. "You have kept
  your word nobly and in my heart I am glad that you have ventured now to break
  it. There&mdash;can I say more?"</p>

  <p>His movement forward had something unreal about it, it was so swift, so
  unhurried, yet so perfectly natural. She rested in his arms for minutes while
  his lips touched hers lightly, almost reverently, passed to her eyes, her
  cheeks, once more to her lips. She drew away with a little smile which
  dispersed, if only he could have known it, lines which had lingered round her
  lips for many weary days and nights.</p>

  <p>"Now," she declared, motioning him to a chair, "I shall really ring for
  tea."</p>

  <p>She avoided the bell and had disappeared through the door which he held
  open without glancing upwards. She had been too late, however, wholly to
  protect herself. He had noticed the rush of tears into her eyes. She closed
  the door softly behind her and he stood for a moment like a man who had
  risked his life and soul in a great battle and had won. His little laugh had
  almost a note of classical music in it, as he walked with the air of a
  conqueror towards the chair in which he had been told to seat himself.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The great commonplace world moved on. Things happened that might have
  happened anywhere. A neatly dressed maid brought in tea, there were hot
  muffins upon a heated plate, and she herself sat behind the Georgian silver
  teapot. She did not ask him whether he took sugar or milk in his tea; they
  both devoured muffins and she wiped her fingers upon his cambric
  handkerchief. They talked very little, there were a few casual references to
  what had become of the geniuses of a few years ago in painting and sculpture,
  and they agreed on the greatness of Epstein. Afterwards they sat upon a sofa,
  not very far apart, whilst the maid cleared away the tea and lit one of the
  wall-lamps. After her departure, there was a silence which almost cost him a
  heartache to break.</p>

  <p>"You were difficult to find," he complained.</p>

  <p>"I had to be," she answered. "Being found out would have been so painful.
  I hoped that you would keep your half-promise and I hoped even more
  energetically that you would break it."</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"I had to break it," he confessed. "I have been in many countries, Pamela,
  but I have never forgotten."</p>

  <p>Her fingers, which had been moving through the complicated meshes of some
  old-fashioned tatting, came to rest. She looked at him enquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Since I settled down here," he said, "I have become a man of two
  purposes, one leaning upon the other. One is already fulfilled, you know what
  it is&mdash;I am here. Half the pain has passed out of my life."</p>

  <p>She asked him a question, but her voice sounded like the far-off trembling
  of a voice from the skies.</p>

  <p>"And the other?"</p>

  <p>"It is," he confided, "to set you free if by any human means it can be
  accomplished."</p>

  <p>She sat very still for several moments. Then her fingers resumed their
  restless motions. She was at work upon her tatting. She had not looked
  towards him once&mdash;but he felt the barrier. The man who had faced many
  ugly perils without flinching was silent now in fear, he was afraid of saying
  the wrong thing. He was afraid of seeing his tower of hopes collapse, afraid
  of the melancholy turn of her head, afraid of those few unchanging words.
  When she spoke it was like sunlight suddenly streaming into a dark place.</p>

  <p>"You may try, Martin," she sighed. "I feel that it is quite hopeless; I
  have given up the idea of living any more like other women, of being set free
  from this haunting load of misery. Once I forbade you to move. I ordered you
  to go away and forget. You obeyed as I meant you to obey, you went away. You
  have come back and up to a certain great point I am glad. I do not know
  whether this will be any reward to you, Martin&mdash;if I were a vain person
  I might say to myself, 'It is perhaps a further persecution,' yet I will tell
  you this. I am just an ordinary woman and I would be happy to live an
  ordinary woman's life&mdash;with you."</p>

  <p>She lifted her eyes and looked at him. She was very nearly sorry. It was a
  man's face, splendid in many ways. The set lines of purpose were there, the
  deep lines of self-control, but for the moment he was happy with a happiness
  which shone out of him, a deep glow of something more than content, the
  delirious joy of a man listening to music which he had been denied all his
  life or hearing suddenly the beautiful words of a reprieve from a sentence of
  death. For a moment she was afraid. She leaned across, laid her hands upon
  his shoulders, and kissed him gently upon the lips.</p>

  <p>"For the moment, Martin," she whispered, "this must help you as it will
  help me&mdash;to meet life. If you think it is worth it, I shall not do what
  I tried to do before, stop your hand. I believe in the fate which should be
  his coming to every man. I trust your judgment as I would trust nobody else's
  in life. If ever the means should come, I will ask no questions. Martin," she
  added with a little break in her voice, which had seemed all the time such
  sweet and easy music, "you look so much happier. I am afraid&mdash;you look
  much happier and nothing may come to us after all. I cannot bear to think of
  you then."</p>

  <p>"I am like the rest of the world," he answered confidently, taking her
  hand. "One chance of Paradise is enough for me."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p>Sir Frederick Leversen scrutinized his visitor through his horn-rimmed
  spectacles with a curiosity not altogether unmixed with a dash of suspicion.
  However, so far as he could see, Martin, although there was something about
  him vaguely familiar, was everything he should be socially, his smile was
  disarming and courteous. He thanked the great lawyer for the permission to
  approach him with the proper amount of gratitude.</p>

  <p>"Very kind of you to see me, I'm sure, Sir Frederick," he said. "I shall
  try not to take up too much of your time."</p>

  <p>"You had better not, sir," was the somewhat curt reply. "As you and the
  world know, I am a busy man. Your name here, I see, is Martin
  Campbell&mdash;did you bring any introduction to me?"</p>

  <p>"I thought perhaps," Martin replied, with a half-apologetic gesture, "that
  I should not need one. My full name is Martin Campbell Brockenhurst."</p>

  <p>The lawyer took off his glasses and polished them slowly with a white silk
  handkerchief, his complexion as pallid as the sheets of parchment upon his
  desk, but a moment later his bright, hard eyes were hidden behind his
  spectacles.</p>

  <p>"The name of Martin Brockenhurst," he said, "recalls to me very
  disagreeable memories."</p>

  <p>"I was afraid it might, sir. It was for that reason that I ventured to
  abbreviate it a little by using the name under which I was better known some
  half a dozen years ago. You may think that I have been long in coming, sir.
  There have been reasons for that. Now that I am here, I want to recall to
  your memory for a few minutes the greatest case that you ever handled."</p>

  <p>"Why should I do this at your request, sir?" the lawyer asked, and his
  hard, dry voice seemed to breathe an underlying threat. "I am too busy a man
  to have my time wasted by answering idle questions or receiving unwelcome
  visitors."</p>

  <p>"I may be unwelcome&mdash;but I am here," Martin said firmly, "and you
  will forgive my saying, Sir Frederick, that it will be to your interests to
  answer the harmless questions I have to ask."</p>

  <p>"About the Lebur case?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally."</p>

  <p>"The case has been closed and finished with for six or more years
  now."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Martin agreed. "Still, the case cannot be considered
  absolutely dead whilst the persons chiefly concerned in it are still
  alive."</p>

  <p>"That," the lawyer remarked hardly, "is not the legal view."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," Martin admitted. "Still, you must admit, Sir Frederick,
  that there have been cases which have been reopened on the disclosure of
  fresh evidence&mdash;and reopened with a very unexpected result."</p>

  <p>"Have you any fresh evidence?" Sir Frederick asked, with a slightly
  scornful smile. "There was a newspaper campaign about this case, I
  remember&mdash;someone tried to reopen it a few years ago. Are you trying to
  dig up the ashes of this?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I am not, sir," Martin replied. "My present inclinations are more
  in the direction of starting a campaign of my own."</p>

  <p>"Is that your intention?" the lawyer asked scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Not at the moment," Martin assured him.</p>

  <p>"Well, since we've gone so far," Sir Frederick remarked, "and I am
  beginning to remember the details of the case to which you refer, ask me your
  questions and have done with it. I have an appointment at the House of
  Commons in half an hour. Still, since you are here, if you have anything to
  ask which deserves an answer, ask it."</p>

  <p>"I shall do my best not to detain you," Martin promised. "My first
  question is this&mdash;how did you persuade Richard Lebur to change his
  plea?"</p>

  <p>The lawyer sat for a moment as though thunderstruck. He made no reply. He
  stared at his visitor, his eyes seemed to have narrowed, certainly the pallor
  of his cheeks had become a shade more ghastly.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean&mdash;change his plea?" he asked at last. "Richard Lebur
  knew that he would be found guilty, the evidence was utterly and entirely
  convincing. Under those circumstances, the accused man sometimes gets a word
  or two of hope, a little consideration from the judge if he pleads
  guilty."</p>

  <p>"But was that your reason?"</p>

  <p>"It might have been," was the terse reply. "But how do you know that the
  suggestion that the prisoner should change his plea came from me? The
  statement itself is false."</p>

  <p>"The statement is true and it requires an answer," Martin declared. "Did
  you induce him to plead guilty with the hope of getting a lighter
  sentence?"</p>

  <p>Black lightning flashed from Sir Frederick's angry eyes.</p>

  <p>"I did not interfere with his own decision. He sent for me one morning
  just before the end and told me that he had decided to plead guilty. As a
  matter of fact, I was against it. I tried to persuade him to change his
  mind&mdash;he refused."</p>

  <p>"May I ask you," Martin persisted, "whether he gave you any reason for his
  decision?"</p>

  <p>"You may ask me," the lawyer replied, "but it was part of a privileged
  conversation between a man about to be tried for his life and his lawyer.
  Therefore, I shall not answer you."</p>

  <p>"I am inclined to doubt," Martin said, "whether the question of privilege
  would apply in such a matter as this. At any rate&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I do not accept it."</p>

  <p>The lawyer's thin, talon-like fingers played for a few moments with the
  paper-weight in front of him. He set it down with a little jerk.</p>

  <p>"You have announced your purpose in coming, Mr.&mdash;shall I say
  Martin&mdash;as being to ask me a few senseless questions about a case long
  since dealt with. I have humoured you to the extent of listening to your
  first one. I have no answer to give you because no answer is possible. I did
  not advise my client to change his plea of 'guilty' in the case to which you
  are referring."</p>

  <p>His fingers were busy again, this time they nearly reached the bell-push
  upon his desk, but Martin intervened.</p>

  <p>"One moment, sir," he begged. "The first, and the vital one, of my
  questions you refuse to answer. Very well, I may possibly accept your plea as
  regards that, if you answer the second one to my satisfaction. Will you tell
  me, sir," Martin concluded, "when was the occasion, and at what hour in the
  day did you yourself see the murdered man?"</p>

  <p>The lawyer's surprise this time was unmistakable. He sat with his mouth
  slightly open, gazing across the table.</p>

  <p>"Did I understand you rightly?" he asked. "You want me to tell you the
  last occasion upon which I saw the murdered man?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Martin answered with composure. "It is not such an
  extraordinary question after all, considering you were both members of the
  same club."</p>

  <p>"The only extraordinary part of the whole affair," Sir Frederick declared
  severely, "is that I am sitting here, listening to you daring to come here
  and ask me questions which are none of your business."</p>

  <p>He leaned over and stabbed at the bell.</p>

  <p>"They will show you out now, sir, and I have only one request to make, and
  that is that you do not set your foot once more in my offices or presume to
  address me in any way. Jenkins," he went on, motioning to the attendant who
  had entered the room, "show this person out. Remember, if you please, that he
  is an unwelcome visitor and see that he is not allowed access to my presence
  again."</p>

  <p>Martin accepted his stick and gloves from the man. He turned and smiled at
  the lawyer.</p>

  <p>"I think perhaps, Sir Frederick," he admitted, "that yours was the best
  line to take. Yes," he added, as he turned away, "I think if I had been in
  your position it is the line I should have taken myself."</p>

  <p>The lawyer made no reply. He had drawn a sheet of paper towards him and
  had commenced to write a letter. He did not even vouchsafe an upward glance
  as his visitor left the room.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p>Martin, a few evenings later, handed his coat and hat to the attendant and
  strolled across to where Lady Diana was seated at the cocktail bar of the
  "Evening Star" night-club. He hoisted himself on to a stool by her side.</p>

  <p>"Here again, dear friend," she remarked. "I am flattered."</p>

  <p>"You needn't be," he answered. "Most agreeable spot, this, and your
  cocktails are very nearly the best in London. The trouble with the two or
  three clubs to which I belong," he went on, "is that they will not move with
  the times. If you want a cocktail it must be mixed in an invisible spot,
  which I always associate with the kitchens, and brought to you in a more or
  less stately lounge upon a platter of good imitation Georgian silver. There
  isn't one of the committee of the few clubs I belong to who doesn't shiver at
  the sound of the word 'bar,' and an up-to-date young man in a white coat with
  a pencil behind his ear and a knowledge of all the idiosyncrasies of his
  regular customers is a thing unknown."</p>

  <p>"A little chatty this evening, Martin," Diana remarked, looking at him
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"I can't say the same of you," he answered. "What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>Diana was evidently disturbed.</p>

  <p>"You startled me, coming in so abruptly."</p>

  <p>"You evidently weren't proud of your companion," he remarked, glancing
  curiously at the man who had slipped away immediately on his entrance. "Who
  is he, Diana? Out with it."</p>

  <p>"He's nobody in particular," she answered. "He comes in now and then and I
  let him have a drink."</p>

  <p>"Why did he shoot away so when I appeared?" Martin asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's an idiot," was the irritated reply. "He insists that he has seen
  you about Scotland Yard."</p>

  <p>"Does he think that I'm a detective?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so."</p>

  <p>Martin was looking straight towards the mirror in front of him, at the
  youngish man skulking behind a screen at the other end of the room.</p>

  <p>"What's he doing, hiding behind the service screen there?" he
  speculated.</p>

  <p>"Trying to keep out of sight of you, I should imagine. Don't bother about
  him, Martin; he really is of no account. He simply has this stupid idea that
  you're a detective and he's afraid of being caught with his little party over
  there. We're keeping inside the law, and always shall, and have nothing to be
  afraid of. What he said did put an idea into my head, though, Martin."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"You're back in England, but I haven't yet heard you mention either of
  your country places. In the old days you were never fond of town life, and if
  this young man is telling the truth, you've been seen once or twice lately
  about Scotland Yard. You're not still worrying about the Lebur case, are
  you?"</p>

  <p>"What could have put that idea into your head, I wonder?" he
  reflected.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you want to know&mdash;and I was going to tell you, in case it
  interested you&mdash;that young man who seems to have disappeared into the
  kitchens&mdash;Leversen is his name&mdash;had something to do with the case,
  hadn't he?"</p>

  <p>Martin was suddenly alert. He had lost his bantering manner, he was
  undoubtedly serious.</p>

  <p>"Leversen," he repeated. "He is in the family firm, I suppose? They were
  the solicitors in the case."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he told me once that he had just been made a partner," Diana
  confided. "Anyhow, he always seems to have plenty of money to spend."</p>

  <p>"Leversen," Martin repeated slowly to himself once more. "I'm getting an
  old man, Diana. I only half remember things. Worst sign of coming old age
  there is. A name strikes you like that with a sudden flash of familiarity,
  and you can't carry it home. Where's he gone, d'you suppose?"</p>

  <p>She glanced at the table, where there was still a vacant seat.</p>

  <p>"He's about somewhere, I should think," she replied. "It isn't a very chic
  crowd he's with, but they're quite decent people and they've piles of money.
  He wouldn't leave without paying his bill, I'm sure. I'm afraid&mdash;it's
  very low-down stuff in a respectable night-club, isn't it, Martin?&mdash;but
  I'm afraid he's behind that screen still. He wouldn't have the nerve to go
  down to my kitchens without permission."</p>

  <p>Martin hesitated, then he glanced towards the screen once more, his
  eyebrows raised.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course, if you want to go there, do," Diana begged. "The whole
  place is at your disposal. But I rather fancy, from the little I know of the
  man, you will find that he's vamoosed. High-class solicitors, Leversen and
  Leversen, you know. If he really believed what he said about you, I can
  understand his doing a bolt. He wouldn't want to be seen here."</p>

  <p>She pointed to where a boy in the clothes of an assistant chef, except
  that he had hastily divested himself of his apron, had approached another man
  seated at the Leversen table, handed him a note, and immediately afterwards
  made for the service door. Diana slipped from her stool and beckoned him.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing up in the restaurant, Adolph?" she asked him. "How
  dare you come up here in those clothes?"</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Gustave, he ordered me, Madame," the boy answered. "There was
  the gentleman who come down, Gustave knew him and they talked together; he
  wrote a note and gave it to Gustave. Gustave handed it to me and told me to
  take it to that party; he said if anyone asked me questions, Monsieur
  Leversen was unwell and had gone home."</p>

  <p>With a little wave of her hand to Martin, Diana crossed the floor and made
  her way to where the little party was seated. The members thereof were very
  uninteresting and obviously highly respectable.</p>

  <p>"Leaving early, aren't you?" Diana asked a young man who seemed to be in
  charge.</p>

  <p>"It is my elder brother, Madame," the young man replied hurriedly. "He
  left us for a few minutes and has sent word now that he is very unwell. My
  mother wishes to go back home as soon as possible. The money for the bill is
  on the plate there."</p>

  <p>An older man in the party pushed the youth on one side.</p>

  <p>"There is no reason why you should not be warned, Madame," he said. "Mr.
  Leversen has had private word that there might be a raid here tonight. We
  want to get out before anyone can take our names. We're all respectable city
  people and it would be bad for our business."</p>

  <p>"I quite understand," Diana agreed. "You can leave as quickly as you like.
  Mr. Leversen can settle up any little differences in the bill another time,
  but I don't think you need be alarmed. Mr. Leversen himself seems to have
  left by the back entrance."</p>

  <p>"We cannot run any risks," the elderly lady declared, as she took her
  cloak from the attendant. "No risks at all. My son is a member of one of the
  leading firms of solicitors in London and to have his name in the newspapers
  as having been at a night-club might do him a great deal of harm. I came just
  for the sake of the young people and I'm sure it has been very pleasant,
  Madame."</p>

  <p>"Well, there you are," Diana said, standing on one side. "The door is wide
  open and you will find plenty of taxis. I will see that you are properly
  bailed out if anything unpleasant happens."</p>

  <p>She shepherded the little party off the dancing-floor, then returned to
  Martin.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Leversen," she announced, "has been taken suddenly ill and left by
  the back entrance. His name must not be seen in the papers because he is a
  partner in the famous firm of Leversen and Leversen."</p>

  <p>Martin tapped a cigarette upon the counter.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he reflected.</p>

  <p>"You have something else in your mind. Tell me about it," she begged.</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all exciting," he assured her. "I was just wondering how much
  he had to do with preparing the brief in that famous case which half the
  people who go in for that sort of thing came trooping to the Old Bailey to
  hear."</p>

  <p>"But why should he want to avoid you?" she asked wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"I cannot imagine," was Martin's bland rejoinder.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>A little crowd of people had surged into the place. The hostess was called
  away to greet acquaintances, including a famous marquis who was giving a
  special supper. Martin returned to his table in the corner. He ordered a
  bottle of his own wine and a sandwich. There was some delay about the
  appearance of the latter and after half an hour's waiting Martin summoned
  Antoine, who was an old acquaintance. There was another slight delay, then
  the ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel came hurrying across the room and presented
  himself with a very disturbed expression upon his usually serene
  countenance.</p>

  <p>"What's the trouble about my sandwich, Antoine?" Martin demanded. "I
  ordered it three quarters of an hour ago, then when it didn't arrive I sent
  for you&mdash;and you haven't hurried particularly, have you?"</p>

  <p>"You will pardon me, if you please, sir," the man begged. "An unfortunate
  incident has occurred down in the kitchens, and when your message came I was
  in doubt as to what to do."</p>

  <p>"To have brought my sandwich would have been the obvious thing," Martin
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps that might not have been altogether satisfactory," the
  ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel replied with a note of grimness in his tone. "I
  was called down into the kitchen by the chef a few minutes before your
  message came for me. I found the chef in great distress. I asked him what was
  the matter; he pointed to a broken plate upon the table and some scattered
  pieces of china in the stove. There were also some fragments of sandwiches
  lying about. It appears that there is a great goof of a young man who is
  employed down in the kitchens as a cleaner who passes things up sometimes to
  the regular waiters, and when I saw him he was lying apparently in a fit upon
  a sofa in the chef's sitting-room beyond&mdash;the chef will tell you all
  about it in his own words if you like as soon as he's finished with that
  souffl&eacute;."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Martin replied, "I don't want to spend my evening down in
  that atmosphere. You can tell me about it."</p>

  <p>"Well, this young fellow&mdash;I don't know his name, but everyone calls
  him Billy&mdash;is always getting into trouble for picking up odd pieces of
  food and eating them, and your sandwiches were apparently too much for him.
  There were four of them, or perhaps more, on a plate, waiting for your
  waiter. He thought no one was looking, so he took one off the plate and took
  a huge bite of it. A few minutes later he was squealing like a young pig. He
  was in terrible pain and they pushed him into the chef's room there.
  Afterwards they sent him off to the hospital in an ambulance and, according
  to two of the men who were down there at the time, he was in a bad way."</p>

  <p>"Where are the rest of the sandwiches?" Martin asked.</p>

  <p>"No one can find them," Antoine replied. "I've told the chef that if
  they're not here in two minutes we must send for the police."</p>

  <p>"Where is what you call the service table?" Martin asked.</p>

  <p>"On the left, just as you enter the place," Antoine explained. "There are
  a few crumbs about in one particular corner, but nothing to be seen of any
  food; neither was the plate nor napkin visible."</p>

  <p>Martin shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"The chef cut the sandwiches himself, sir," the man continued, "and the
  only other person to touch them was his assistant, Adolph, who carried them
  through. Gustave was in such a state when he saw the condition of the young
  man that he took hold of the ham and locked it up in one of the safes. He was
  obliged to go back then to the food he was preparing. He is doing a special
  supper for the Marquis tonight."</p>

  <p>The chef himself came hurrying up the stairs and made his way towards
  Martin's table. The sweat was standing out upon his forehead and he paused
  for a moment to wipe it away.</p>

  <p>"It was for this gentleman, the sandwiches, yes?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The sandwiches were being prepared for me," Martin acknowledged.</p>

  <p>"Permit me to confess that it was I myself who cut them," the chef
  declared. "Antoine here, he tell me that they were for a special patron and
  friend of her Ladyship's. I gave them to Adolph to put on the table whilst I
  returned to my fire. A minute or two afterwards I heard a commotion and what
  sounded like the smashing of a plate. I cannot even turn my head. I was
  warming the special sauce for the Marquis and following his detailed
  instructions concerning it. It is, you understand, a small joint of his own
  venison that he brought in himself for this party of friends. Then I heard
  the groaning from behind and they came and told me that Billy had been taken
  ill. I said, 'Put him in my salon and leave him there; from this spot I do
  not move.' As soon as there was a pause I hear the trouble. Billy has stolen
  one of my special sandwiches and declares that he is poisoned. I show you the
  ham, Monsieur."</p>

  <p>The chef turned to a dish which he had been carrying. He held out the dish
  upon which there were slices of ham that had recently been carved. Martin
  examined it closely and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Nothing wrong with that," he remarked. "Well, I've lost my appetite now,
  Chef; I'll drink my wine and eat a dry biscuit. I can get those at the bar.
  Your young kitchen-hand had better be sacked, I should think. You can't keep
  a young fool like that who goes about interfering with the customers'
  dishes."</p>

  <p>"Sacked indeed he will be," the chef promised. "I offer Monsieur my most
  regretful apologies."</p>

  <p>"It isn't of any particular consequence," Martin said indifferently. "The
  atmosphere down below is none too good, you know, and I imagine that the
  young goof, whoever he was, was feeling pretty sick before he took up the
  sandwich."</p>

  <p>"They disgust one, these gamins," the chef observed angrily. "They pick up
  and eat discarded pieces of food from everywhere. In my kitchen there shall
  be no more of them; I will have the young women instead. They are not so
  greedy. I offer Monsieur once more my respectful apologies. I now serve up
  the great meal of the evening to <i>Monsieur le Marquis</i>."</p>

  <p>The chef took his leave and Martin returned to his place. He sipped his
  wine thoughtfully. Later on, Diana left the large party on the other side of
  the room and came across to him.</p>

  <p>"I wish you weren't so unsociable, Martin," she lamented as she accepted a
  chair and a cigarette. "The Marquis would so much like you to go and join his
  table."</p>

  <p>"Very kind of him," Martin replied. "I would with pleasure if I had come
  across him earlier in the evening. I used to know the old boy many years
  ago&mdash;Cuxhaven he was then, always a good sort."</p>

  <p>"He's a dear. What's my chef been up talking to you about?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he came up to apologize about the sandwiches. He wanted to cut some
  more, but I decided to have a dry biscuit instead. How long have you had him,
  Diana? His face seems familiar."</p>

  <p>"You might have seen him at some of the shooting-luncheons at home," she
  confided. "He used to come out sometimes and superintend the arrangements
  when we had any of the big pots."</p>

  <p>Martin nodded.</p>

  <p>"I remember him quite well," he acknowledged. "Look here, Diana, I wonder
  whether you would do something for me?"</p>

  <p>"My darling," she answered, "don't you know that I'm your slave? I would
  kiss the light out of those terribly attractive eyes of yours if you told me
  to."</p>

  <p>"I want something much simpler. I should like you to ask your secretary to
  give me in the morning a list of the registration cards of the men who are
  working in your kitchens, leaving out the chef."</p>

  <p>"My dear Martin, what on earth for?"</p>

  <p>"Just a fancy of mine. Here comes your secretary, with a face like a
  Chinese mourner at a funeral."</p>

  <p>"He's always worrying me about trifles," she complained with a little
  grimace. "Well, what is it, Mr. Branson?" she said as he came to a standstill
  at her side.</p>

  <p>"An unfortunate incident has happened in the kitchens, Madame," he
  announced. "If you could spare a moment the chef would like to tell you his
  version of it himself. He would have sent word before, but he has been very
  busy with some special dishes."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that it is really necessary for me to go, Mr. Branson?" she
  expostulated. "Surely it is a matter with which you could deal."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not, Madame," the man persisted. "If you could spare just a
  matter of five minutes."</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet and excused herself with a little gesture of disgust
  to Martin as she floated away.</p>

  <p>"If you knew how I hated going into those smelly places," she
  grumbled.</p>

  <p>Martin sipped his wine and glanced at the late edition of an evening paper
  which had just been brought in. Diana made her reappearance in a very few
  minutes. There was a frown of annoyance upon her face.</p>

  <p>"Really, Branson is a tiresome old bore," she exclaimed as she resumed her
  place. "It seems that one of the scullery boys, who has a habit of eating
  anything he can get hold of, has made himself sick and had pains, and they've
  been obliged to send him to the hospital. I don't see what concern it is of
  mine, anyway."</p>

  <p>"You must remember, my dear," he told her, "that you have
  responsibilities. This affair of yours is not like Adelaide's hat-shop or
  Clara's dress salon. Those girls just entertain their friends, dispense
  cocktails, and never look inside an account book. But this is a real business
  institution; you're making money&mdash;ought to make a small fortune, I
  should think, if they don't change the law."</p>

  <p>"But I do work," the girl insisted. "I work hard, Martin. I take care of
  myself in the daytime, never go to an afternoon cocktail party. I close this
  place regularly at three o'clock and I'm always in bed at four. I ride in the
  Park every morning, have another sleep after my lunch, and I am absolutely as
  fit as a fiddle. I know I'm making money and I only hope it goes on. The one
  thing I don't want in connection with my club is 'incidents.' I can't imagine
  why they wanted to send that boy to a hospital. These sort of things always
  get into the papers."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't worry about it for a moment," Martin advised her. "Tell me,
  does that fellow Leversen come in here often?"</p>

  <p>"Fairly often. Generally brings one of his family with him. I've never
  seen him going gay or anything of that sort. He seems to be on very good
  terms with all the servants, so I suppose he tips them very well&mdash;and
  that reminds me, he was asking me only the other day whether you weren't a
  member here."</p>

  <p>Mr. Branson, a little heavy-footed and with a grave expression, came
  across from his office. He leaned down a little towards Lady Diana.</p>

  <p>"I've just had a telephone call from the hospital, your Ladyship," he
  announced. "I am sorry to say that the young man we sent there died a few
  minutes ago."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p>Pamela turned her head slowly, very slowly indeed. She was seated on a low
  stool before her canvas, which she had adjusted to its lowest peg. She had
  been trying to catch the last sweep of sunlight, shining feebly enough
  through a misty sky. Then the knock had come. She turned around and she was
  conscious of a queer sensation. She knew that she was afraid. She rose slowly
  to her feet and she stared for a moment through the shadows. The knock came
  again, a little quicker, a little more impatient this time. The brush slipped
  from her fingers; she looked around the large studio with its shadowy
  corners, its cupboards, its general air of comfort, disorderliness, softened
  by a touch of artistic recklessness. She very seldom suffered from nerves,
  but there was no doubt that in those few minutes she knew that she was
  afraid. An ordinary visitor would have known that there was a bell, a little
  out of sight but there for the use of her friends and visitors, of whom there
  were so few. This must be a stranger, and just then Pamela was afraid of
  strangers. She moved towards the door, very slowly. It was closed with a
  spring lock; the handle her side was of old Venetian brass, many hundreds of
  years old but a fragile thing. There was no bolt. As she stood there the
  knock came again and it seemed to her that it spoke with a living voice. It
  seemed to her that the most horrible thing in the world which could happen
  had come to pass. She looked at the telephone. It stood only a few feet away
  and the sound of her voice could easily be heard out on the landing. She
  stood still, twining and untwining her fingers. Supposing she remained
  breathlessly silent? Then perhaps the visitor would go on his way in the
  belief that she was not there. Then again her heart sank. She remembered that
  she had pushed the little slat opposite to her name on the oaken board below
  to indicate that she was in. She heard the creaking of shoes outside, a
  little cough, the visitor was becoming impatient.</p>

  <p>"Open the door," a hoarse voice demanded from outside. "There's someone
  standing there, I can tell that. I wish to see the lady of the house."</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Pamela asked. "I do not recognize your voice. I do not
  think I know you."</p>

  <p>"Then you're in for a joyful surprise," was the curtly spoken response.
  "Open the door, Pamela, unless you wish to have me found on your
  doormat."</p>

  <p>For a moment the room whirled round her. This then was the answer to the
  haunting fear of the last few hours. She should have flown the moment the
  news was in the papers. She was trapped.</p>

  <p>"Is it wise to come here?" she asked breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Open the door, damn you," was the angry reply.</p>

  <p>She turned the handle with trembling fingers. The man who stood there
  first glanced down the wide stairs, but there was no one upon them or on
  either of the landings&mdash;no sound to be heard throughout the whole
  building. The caller slipped into the room, closed the door behind him, threw
  his hat on to a sofa and held out his arms.</p>

  <p>"No embrace for the wanderer, Pamela?" he asked, with bitter sarcasm.</p>

  <p>She drew a little farther away.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry for all you have suffered," she said, "but you cannot
  expect me to say that I am glad to see you."</p>

  <p>"Give me some whisky or brandy," he ordered, "a handful of cigarettes and
  some matches. Then we will have our little talk."</p>

  <p>She pointed to a chiffonier, where he rummaged about and helped
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you any servants?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I have two," she answered. "They are out for the day. That is to say,"
  she corrected herself quickly, "one is out for the day, the other might be
  back at any moment."</p>

  <p>He laughed mockingly.</p>

  <p>"I think you were right the first time," he scoffed. "Wait until I've had
  my first drink."</p>

  <p>He consumed a whole tumblerful of whisky and soda, then he threw himself
  on the couch, placed a tin of biscuits by his side and began to eat
  voraciously. With terrified but fascinated eyes she watched him.
  Notwithstanding the signs of hardship and poor living in his face, his
  unkempt hair and his broken fingernails, he was still a handsome man.</p>

  <p>"They let me shave, you see," he remarked, "or your husband might have
  returned to you with a black beard. You wouldn't have cared for that, would
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Your looks are nothing to me," she answered with a shiver. "You have
  known that for a long time. You have done a cruel thing in coming here,
  Richard."</p>

  <p>"Cruel!" he repeated savagely. "You're my wife, aren't you? You belong to
  me, and if this is your home, half of it is mine, and don't forget it,
  Pamela," he wound up, lighting one of the cigarettes. "What there is left of
  you is mine, too. Mine to take when I want it, and I've led a pretty lonely
  life for the last six years."</p>

  <p>"You cad," she rejoined quietly.</p>

  <p>She was becoming calmer every moment. The more brutal he was, the more
  impossible the situation, the more surely she felt her poise and composure
  returning. All the time, too, her brain was working. There must be a way of
  getting rid of him.</p>

  <p>"You haven't any of my old clothes here, I suppose?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I have not," she answered. "I gave them all to your servant."</p>

  <p>"What, Jones? He didn't deserve them, the skunk. If he'd given his
  evidence the way my lawyer instructed him he'd have saved me a great
  deal."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," she answered, "he preferred to tell the truth."</p>

  <p>"Listen," he went on, "is old Leversen alive still?"</p>

  <p>"So far as I know."</p>

  <p>"And his Lordship? The man who tried his best to hang me?"</p>

  <p>"I saw his name amongst the guests at a party last week," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Stinking hound," the man on the couch muttered.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Well," he went on, "I spent years brooding over these people. Something
  may come of it some day. Not just yet. If your maids are out, Pamela, who is
  going to cook me some dinner?"</p>

  <p>"There is no one," she told him. "You must go and buy your own food. It is
  quite impossible for you to stay here. The police are certain to hunt you
  down."</p>

  <p>"Not in the least likely," he assured her. "From the report of the trial
  they would judge that we were on bad terms and the last place they would come
  to look for me is in your flat. They would never guess that we're still in
  love with one another, would they, Pamela?"</p>

  <p>He smiled at her, an insinuating, almost a fascinating smile. She shrank
  away.</p>

  <p>"I was never in love with you, Richard Lebur," she declared. "I married
  you against my better judgment. You have given me bitter cause for
  repentance."</p>

  <p>He shook his head gloomily.</p>

  <p>"This is a nice way to greet your husband after he has risked his life to
  gain his freedom and come back to you," he said bitterly. "Go and get me some
  wine and come across and drink with me."</p>

  <p>"I have very little wine here, for, as you know, I rarely take it," she
  answered.</p>

  <p>"That sounds unsociable," he remarked. "What about Bessie, your
  good-looking housemaid&mdash;I don't believe she is out&mdash;why can't you
  send her in to me? She wouldn't be quite so brutal to her master as you
  are."</p>

  <p>There was something in his eyes which frightened her. She felt her
  composure slipping away.</p>

  <p>"I told you the truth," she said. "They are both out, and Bessie left a
  long time ago. I don't know why you came here, Richard, but if you want money
  I can let you have some."</p>

  <p>"Give me all you have," he ordered; "but remember, my beautiful Pamela, I
  didn't come here for money alone."</p>

  <p>She turned on the light, opened a desk at the farther part of the room,
  took out a small coffer and emptied it into her trembling hands.</p>

  <p>"It is all I have in the house," she assured him. "Take it and go away,
  please."</p>

  <p>He remained on the sofa.</p>

  <p>"Bring it to me," he ordered. "Don't keep so far away, Pamela. Wonderful
  how you've kept your looks," he went on. "It's not my type of beauty, you
  know, but it's good of its sort. Spirituelle, I suppose you'd call your face,
  wouldn't you? Your figure, I think, has improved," he went on, leaning back,
  regarding her with sardonic cruelty and studying her critically. "A little
  lean in the flank you used to be, like that filly I had we thought was going
  to do such big things."</p>

  <p>It wasn't so much the words, she thought afterwards, it wasn't so much the
  tone, although there was something terrible underneath its note of mockery.
  It was the glitter in his eyes, the strange, lascivious look with which he
  seemed to be measuring her up. She leaned forward and deliberately threw the
  money in her hands straight at his face. More than ever before, it seemed to
  her, she hated him, as he stooped, laughing to himself, and collected the
  silver and notes which lay all round and on the couch. He glanced towards the
  door, to be sure that she was making no attempt to escape, and stuffed it all
  in his pockets.</p>

  <p>"Quite as much as I expected to find in the house," he remarked. "We'll
  talk about what you have in the bank later on."</p>

  <p>"Neither this money," she said, with a wonderful return of her
  self-control, "or any part of it, or any part of the money I have in the
  bank, belongs to you&mdash;not any part of it."</p>

  <p>"You may have been keeping some gigolo for all I know or care. I'll have
  him out of here."</p>

  <p>"You'll have yourself back in Dartmoor, or whatever prison you came from,
  in ten minutes if you shout like that," she warned him. "Stop and think what
  you're talking about, for goodness' sake. It seems to me that you've escaped
  from prison&mdash;is that so?"</p>

  <p>"And damned sorry you are, aren't you?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"What you seem to forget," she told him, "is that most certainly you'll be
  back there again before many hours have passed if you behave like this. Why
  can't you be sensible? I'll help you if I can, even if it's against the law,"
  she went on, "but I won't have you here. You've lost your sense of how to
  talk to anyone. You've said foul things to me. You used, at any rate on the
  surface, to behave like a gentleman."</p>

  <p>"I am not sure that I want to any longer," he replied. "Behaving like a
  gentleman hasn't brought me very far, has it? Supposing I tell you that I
  feel like behaving just as I choose for once in my life and taking the
  consequences, whatever they may be?"</p>

  <p>She was trembling violently. She knew what he did not know&mdash;that both
  the maids were staying out by special permission until the next morning. She
  had planned to have a long, quiet evening, to think out her work, to read
  some books she had fetched the day before from the library. There they were,
  just as she had brought them in. She had meant to paint a little, play a
  little to herself on the baby grand piano at the other end of the room, and
  dream a little. There were times when the emotions were troublesome, when it
  was such a joy to be alone. She had looked forward to tonight. And now had
  come this vision of stark, staring hell. Every moment she was more hatefully
  aware of the change in the man. Prison life had coarsened him, had let loose
  the animal which was never far from the surface. She looked wildly round the
  room. She could have beaten against the walls in her fear. All the time she
  felt his eyes upon her. It was a slow, cruel torture she was suffering.</p>

  <p>"Will you go away?" she begged. "I will send you money. I will help you to
  escape if I can, but I want you to go away from here."</p>

  <p>He looked at her suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because you frighten me," she explained. "You are not like yourself even
  when you were at your worst."</p>

  <p>Even now he was a fine figure of a man, although a little given to
  drooping his head and slouching. He walked the whole length of the room with
  his hand behind his back. He paused, suddenly, in front of her.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever tried to divorce me, Pamela?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She smiled bitterly.</p>

  <p>"They wouldn't grant me a divorce, even if I chose to apply for it, just
  because you were in prison," she answered.</p>

  <p>He chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Beastly old-fashioned laws, the English, aren't they? And you mean to
  tell me," he went on, looking her straight in the eyes, "that all this time
  you have been faithful to an absentee husband?"</p>

  <p>"I have had no one to be faithful to," she replied. "I have not counted on
  you as being my husband. I have kept myself to myself, if that is what you
  mean. It is my way of living."</p>

  <p>"Six years," he muttered to himself. "Why, you must be twenty-nine,
  Pamela."</p>

  <p>"It is no business of yours, but it is the truth," she answered. "I am
  twenty-nine."</p>

  <p>He resumed his walk of the room. Something seemed to have brought back the
  old fears. He walked and carried himself like a criminal. Every now and then
  he stopped and listened. Once or twice he peered out of the window. A
  taxi-cab stopped below. He listened at the door to the people slowly mounting
  the steps. When they had passed and mounted higher, he rubbed his forehead
  with his handkerchief.</p>

  <p>He smiled wickedly across at her.</p>

  <p>"I'm as safe here as anywhere," he declared. "Tomorrow morning I shall
  have my chance of escape. If I am taken before then I would rather be taken
  after I had spent the night, according to the evidence which will be given,
  in my wife's apartments."</p>

  <p>Internally, the turmoil was tremendous, externally she kept her voice and
  her appearance almost calm.</p>

  <p>"If you attempt to stay here, Richard," she threatened him, "I shall hunt
  the streets until I find a policeman to give you up to. I shall either do
  that or kill you. It will mean the end of your life, anyway."</p>

  <p>That same fiendishly irritating smile was back on his lips. It was satanic
  because it seemed to bring the elements of humour to mingle with the avowed
  purpose of a man about to commit a sin.</p>

  <p>"We'll play the game out," he declared. "You and I will go into the larder
  now and see if there is anything you can cook for my dinner."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p>Martin, a few minutes later, laid down his pen and took up the telephone
  receiver which stood upon his desk. A hoarse, unfamiliar voice spoke to him
  over the telephone.</p>

  <p>"Is that Martin Brockenhurst?"</p>

  <p>"It is."</p>

  <p>"You are asked to come round at once, and without questions, to Number 17
  Richmond Mansions, Chelsea. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," Martin replied. "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter who I am. If you are a friend of Pamela Lebur, the
  artist, you will be round at her flat in ten minutes&mdash;five, if
  possible."</p>

  <p>"I shall be there," was the curt answer.</p>

  <p>Fortunately his car was waiting outside. At the corner of Piccadilly he
  received the shock of his life. A news vendor was waving a placard. There it
  was in ominous black characters:</p>

  <p class="headline">MURDERER ESCAPES FROM DARTMOOR<br>
  REPORTED TO HAVE REACHED LONDON</p>

  <p>Martin's foot leaned on the accelerator. He drove with reasonable care but
  desperate eagerness. He pulled up outside the block of flats in Chelsea
  within the ten minutes. He ran up the stairs and rang the bell at the
  studio's outer door. Lebur free and ringing up from Pamela's flat! The whole
  thing was fantastic&mdash;it was worse, it was diabolical. He pressed the
  door-handle viciously. A rough-looking man in a ready-made suit of blue serge
  opened the door. Nothing but his voice was in the least familiar.</p>

  <p>"Glad you could come, Brockenhurst. You've seen the news, I expect. They
  may be after me at any moment, but I must have a few words with you
  first."</p>

  <p>"Where's Pamela?" Martin demanded.</p>

  <p>She appeared at that moment from the other end of the room. Her little
  sobbing cry was like music to Martin. She came over to him, swift and eager,
  the light of an enormous and overwhelming relief in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Martin!" she cried. "Martin, how did you get here?"</p>

  <p>"He rang me up," was the breathless reply. "It was you at the telephone, I
  suppose, Lebur?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I rang you up. I needed help from a man and you seemed to be as
  likely as anyone. Besides, I wanted to talk to you."</p>

  <p>Pamela was sobbing quietly to herself. The relief from the strain of the
  last hour was too much for her. She had thrown herself back in an easy-chair
  and Martin was standing by her side. Lebur looked at them both and there was
  a sneer underlying his tone when he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I've been rather a beast to her, Brockenhurst," he said with
  suave cruelty. "My coming frightened her to death and her welcome wasn't much
  to offer a man who has been five or six years in hell. I told her I'd come
  back to stay. If she hadn't been just a little fool she'd have known that the
  last spot on earth I'm likely to linger in is my ex-wife's apartment. I want
  to get away as quickly as I can. I want you to help me, but before I leave
  I've a commission for you, Brockenhurst. You're the only honest man I know.
  You've got to listen to what I tell you and you've got to do what I ask."</p>

  <p>Martin remained silent. The ex-convict threw himself into an
  easy-chair.</p>

  <p>"Forgive my sitting down," he sneered. "I've had a long time of wooden
  benches and it's a luxury to me to feel a cushion underneath."</p>

  <p>"How did you get away?" Martin asked.</p>

  <p>"Never mind that," was the curt reply. "I didn't kill anyone, as some of
  the others have done. I got away on a foggy night and because I'm a strong
  man and because I had the one thing that's necessary&mdash;a change of
  clothes at hand. They aren't much of clothes, perhaps," he added, looking
  down at himself, "but such as they are, they've helped me to travel up safely
  from Devonshire. I've passed without much trouble through the streets of
  London after a shave and a Turkish bath, the purchase of a clean collar and
  another tie. Here I am, and so far as I know, I haven't been traced here. The
  police are bound to come, however, to make enquiries from Pamela. Before they
  come you've got to listen to me."</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," Martin invited. "I'm ready."</p>

  <p>Lebur stretched out his hand and helped himself to a generous whisky and
  soda. He half-closed his eyes with pleasure, but he drank moderately.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Martin Brockenhurst," he said, and his voice now became
  noticeably clearer. "You can prepare for the shock of your life&mdash;you,
  too, may get a little thrill out of it, Pamela. I did not kill David
  Culpepper."</p>

  <p>"What!" Martin exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I was innocent of the charge. A man of guilt in many ways, perhaps, but I
  repeat that I did not kill David Culpepper."</p>

  <p>They were both incredulous.</p>

  <p>"But you pleaded guilty!" Pamela exclaimed. "You applied for leave to
  alter your plea."</p>

  <p>"That is true," Lebur acknowledged, "but I repeat again that I did not
  kill David Culpepper. I want you to get that into your heads for a moment,
  and then I'll go on."</p>

  <p>"Go on," Martin begged.</p>

  <p>"Remember," Lebur continued, "I have nothing whatever to gain by telling
  you a lie, Brockenhurst, or you, Pamela. Therefore you must ask yourselves,
  Why do I insist upon telling you this? My answer is this&mdash;to get me out
  of that hell down at Dartmoor it is necessary for you to find out who did
  kill him."</p>

  <p>"To find out who did kill him?" Martin repeated, a little dazed.</p>

  <p>"It should not be difficult. It was my own lawyers, the great firm of
  Leversen, or rather a member of it, who induced me to plead guilty. The bait
  was simple&mdash;it was penal servitude instead of hanging. I had a strong
  disinclination to go out of the world by being hanged by the neck. When the
  lawyer who had the case in hand, one of Leversen's own men&mdash;his son, I
  think it was&mdash;told me that I had not one chance in the world of escaping
  a death sentence if I persisted in my plea of 'Not Guilty,' what he said
  sounded damned reasonable. The evidence, I knew, was dead against me. He
  insisted that I should make an appeal to the Judge and have the plea changed.
  I did it. The little rat knew that I was not guilty&mdash;there was something
  in his eyes which told me so, but I believed him at the time. All men are
  fools once in their lives and generally at a moment of crisis&mdash;I was a
  fool then. My plea was 'Not Guilty.' I changed my plea to 'Guilty,' and, as I
  had been promised, I was sentenced to penal servitude for life."</p>

  <p>"So that was why you called out when they were taking you away," Martin
  muttered.</p>

  <p>"Just so," the ex-convict admitted. "I couldn't bear it at the last. The
  eyes of the whole court seemed to be upon me. I recognized men there whom I
  had known all my life&mdash;and women&mdash;and I hated myself for having
  listened to that filthy little lawyer. The only thing that carried weight
  with me was one of his arguments. 'If you can get away with it,' he said,
  'which you can by pleading "Guilty," the truth may come out some day, if the
  truth is that you did not commit the murder. If you're telling the truth to
  me at this moment, Mr. Lebur, when you swear that you did not kill him, then
  I say that the truth always comes out some time or other and you'll have a
  chance of freedom and preserving your honour while you're still alive. If, on
  the other hand, you stick to a plea of "Not Guilty," you haven't one chance
  in a hundred of leaving this world in any other way than with a rope round
  your neck....' That's the story I have to tell you, Martin Brockenhurst, and
  I've got to ask you a hard thing&mdash;I've got to ask you to believe
  it."</p>

  <p>Pamela rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Richard," she said, "I for one believe it. I believe for the first time
  that you are telling the truth. I never believed you before&mdash;I believe
  you now. I am sorry."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's something to take back with me, at any rate," Lebur said
  with a smile which was not altogether disagreeable. "I ask your pardon,
  Pamela, if I've frightened the life out of you today. Prison makes beasts of
  men; it has made a beast of me except in such moments as this. And don't be
  afraid, Pamela. You've said words I am glad to have had you say, but if ever
  the truth comes out and my innocence of that one particular crime is
  established, I shall never be a worry to you. I was a bad husband and I was
  unfaithful to you fifty times. I shall never claim any rights over you and I
  hope that you will be happy in the way that seems to you right and which you
  choose. You understand?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," she answered. "We'll forget that side of the past, Richard,
  willingly."</p>

  <p>"You can consider yourself free from me whenever you like," Lebur went on.
  "I haven't deserved even a hundredth part of the fidelity you gave me when we
  were living together. Send a lawyer to the prison at any time you like and I
  will furnish you with a dozen proofs, even up to the day before my trial,
  which will establish your claim to a divorce."</p>

  <p>Martin, who saw the misery in Pamela's face, broke in.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "I think it's all clearly understood between you and
  your wife now. I don't want to butt in, but I can't help thinking that you
  may have disagreeable visitors here, Lebur, at any time. Don't you think
  you'd better tell me the true story of David Culpepper's death as quickly as
  possible if I am to be able to do anything for you?"</p>

  <p>"You accept the trust then, Brockenhurst?"</p>

  <p>"I accept it willingly," Martin replied. "I am going to force myself to
  believe you although it seems incredible. You did not kill David Culpepper.
  Then who did?"</p>

  <p>"That is what you have to find out."</p>

  <p>"Haven't you any clue?"</p>

  <p>"Sarah had plenty of other admirers&mdash;more than you would believe
  possible."</p>

  <p>"Even then, the first difficulty that a man of common sense has to face is
  this&mdash;how could such a woman inspire any man with a passion strong
  enough to make him risk the gallows for her sake?"</p>

  <p>Lebur made no immediate answer. He had the air of a man who desires to
  choose his words carefully.</p>

  <p>"You might ask yourself that, Martin Brockenhurst," he said, with a faint
  sneer in his tone. "I might have when I was a boy. I can only answer you in
  one way. There are women famous, or, rather, infamous, in history&mdash;and
  more especially in the history of such crimes as this&mdash;who have the gift
  of bringing the madness out of a man as no good woman could. There are women,
  nothing much to look at, some of them, strange women who can drive men almost
  crazy with their unusual gifts. This woman is one of them. How she did it I
  don't know, but I was one of her victims. She was one of those women who can
  bring dead passions to life again, one of those women who can relight fires
  that a man might honestly believe had burned out of him. It was in her blood,
  Brockenhurst. Perhaps a really good man would never have felt it. I can tell
  you that she brought everything that was evil in me dancing in my blood as no
  other woman ever has or could."</p>

  <p>There was a curious silence in the room. Pamela had turned a little away.
  She was gazing with a strained expression into the shadows beyond the two
  men, but Martin always fancied there was a light of real understanding in her
  beautiful, curiously lit eyes.</p>

  <p>"I saw the woman the first day in court," Martin said quietly. "If one
  could accept what you say, Lebur&mdash;and you speak like a man who
  knows&mdash;well, that way may lie the explanation. To the eyes of the
  ordinary onlooker, she was a coarse, ungainly person, flamboyant in
  appearance, without any sort of refinement, without any visible allure."</p>

  <p>"Ever read the books of a Frenchman called Zola?" Lebur asked.</p>

  <p>Martin nodded.</p>

  <p>Pamela, who had been listening intently, turned her head.</p>

  <p>"I know what Richard is trying to explain," she said calmly. "I heard a
  very great Frenchman once talk for an hour in a French studio, and talk
  eloquently, of that 'secret gift,' as he called it."</p>

  <p>Lebur nodded. There were new lines which seemed to have crept into his
  face, the gleam of a strange light of understanding in his hard eyes.</p>

  <p>"The secret gift," he repeated. "That's just what she had. I never
  pretended to be faithful to you, as you know, Pamela," he went on, a sudden
  return of the coarseness underlying his words and his tone becoming almost
  flagrantly noticeable. "You were not my sort for that kind of thing. I found
  it out as soon as I married you. You can't say I worried you very much with
  amorous proposals afterwards. I never pretended to be faithful to you, but,
  my God, I was faithful to that woman. I could not get the longing for her out
  of my blood&mdash;that's that! Your question is answered, Martin
  Brockenhurst. There are madmen in the world. There is madness in the breath
  some women inhale and exhale as there is poison in the blood of a scorpion. I
  never killed David Culpepper, but I won't say that some day or other I
  shouldn't have done it. The other man got in first. He came while I was
  there. She pushed me away. I was to go into another room. It was agony. I
  drank a half-bottle of whisky. I must have been half-drunk. Then I heard the
  door-bell of her flat ring again, I heard the sound of voices&mdash;I drank
  more whisky. I was blind. When at last I opened the door and staggered out,
  there it was in front of me!" he cried, rising to his feet and pointing with
  both arms extended to the drama which he alone saw. "There was David
  Culpepper lying dead with his back against the banister. There was the
  revolver lying by his side, the sour smell of gunpowder in the air, the
  telephone behind that closed door being treated furiously, and the sound of
  Sarah Rose's voice bawling down the instrument. 'Police! Police!! Police!!!'
  I could hear her yelling. I picked up the revolver. It was one I had given
  the woman myself when she complained of being frightened at night. It had my
  initials engraved upon it. I was gripping it, turning it over, wondering how
  it came there, when they came up the stairs&mdash;two policemen and an
  inspector a few yards behind. They are quite right. I threw the revolver down
  just as they described and I kicked the dead man as he lay there&mdash;I
  hated him so. All quite correct. All the same, that is everything I know
  about the murder."</p>

  <p>"The woman's evidence, then, was a tissue of falsehoods?" Martin
  observed.</p>

  <p>"Falsehoods, bloody falsehoods...!"</p>

  <p>Lebur was losing control of himself. It was not until Martin held him by
  the throat that he ceased his torrent of abuse. Pamela sat quite quietly and
  without movement. She listened to his stream of foul language without
  flinching. Martin's grip choked him into silence.</p>

  <p>"You are a fool to waste your breath like this."</p>

  <p>Lebur recovered himself slightly. He scowled across the room at Pamela as
  though anxious to see how his language had affected her. "Always a coarse
  brute, wasn't I?" he muttered. "You never heard me talk like that before,
  though. That's prison&mdash;six years of Dartmoor have done that."</p>

  <p>"Well, don't do it again," Martin begged him firmly. "If you can't
  remember that your wife is here, remember at least for your own sake that
  every unnecessary moment you spend here is a risk. Besides, you might be
  better employed answering my questions."</p>

  <p>"Go on," Lebur invited hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"This woman whom you speak of," Martin continued, "this Sarah Rose, as she
  was called, either committed the murder herself or deliberately sacrificed
  you for someone else?"</p>

  <p>"As if I don't know that," Lebur snarled. "As if I don't brood over it
  sometimes all night long. God, there have been nights when, if I could get
  her by the throat, just one twist of the fingers would finish her. But I will
  tell you something, Martin, before I have finished with her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hold your tongue," the other ordered firmly. "If you can't behave
  yourself, Lebur, I am sorry, but out you will go into the streets and take
  your chance of what turns up. Now answer this question."</p>

  <p>"Get on with it then."</p>

  <p>"The man for whose sake this woman was prepared to swear your life away
  must have been someone of importance to her. Try and think. She was the sort
  of woman to have boasted to her other admirers, I should think, if she had
  one she was specially fond of. Someone, perhaps, who might have held a
  different sort of position in life. Did she ever give you any idea as to who
  he might have been?"</p>

  <p>"Never&mdash;never mentioned the names of any of her admirers&mdash;never
  to me, at any rate. She knew me too well. She knew that it only took a word
  or two from her to make me flame up with jealousy."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to try and see her while you are free?"</p>

  <p>"What business is that of yours?" Lebur demanded.</p>

  <p>"It is my business," Martin replied, "only if you really expect me to take
  an interest in your affairs. I suppose your wife and I are the only two
  people in the world, except the actual murderer if he is still alive, who
  don't believe you guilty of murdering Culpepper. I will do what I can for you
  so long as you behave. On the other hand, you must answer my
  questions&mdash;are you going to try and see this woman?"</p>

  <p>"I dare not," Lebur confessed hoarsely. "My temper has not improved in
  Dartmoor. It is not a soothing place. Those warders are not any too pleasant
  companions, and daily life there is just hell. If I found myself alone with
  her&mdash;well, I could almost spell the thing out. I could tell you what
  would happen, but don't be afraid, I won't. I don't know where to find
  her&mdash;I should not go if I did."</p>

  <p>There was a curious little tremble in his tone.</p>

  <p>"You promise," Martin went on, "that you won't go back to any of the
  haunts which she used to frequent here in London?"</p>

  <p>"I promise."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do when you leave here? You are not going anywhere
  near your father, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"Not if I can get enough money out of my beloved wife," was the sardonic
  reply. "There would not be any fatted calf business about going back to see
  the old man."</p>

  <p>"He can have all the money he wants from me," Pamela said quietly. "He has
  some claim on it. His father would have continued his allowance, if I would
  have accepted it, all the time that he has been in prison."</p>

  <p>Lebur groaned.</p>

  <p>"A thousand a year it was."</p>

  <p>"You can have a thousand pounds if you want it," Pamela told him calmly.
  "I will go to the Bank tomorrow morning and get it."</p>

  <p>"And me on my way to Wapping tomorrow to try and get a boat," Lebur
  observed with an evil chuckle. "A thousand pounds in my pocket, eh? Well,
  where shall I come for it?"</p>

  <p>"Not here," Pamela begged him. "Mr. Brockenhurst will help us,
  perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will see to it," Martin promised. "Where are you sleeping
  tonight?"</p>

  <p>Lebur drew a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"It's down Wapping way," he said. "I know how to get there."</p>

  <p>"You know my telephone number," Martin directed Lebur. "Ring me up any
  time between ten and eleven tomorrow morning; we can have money for you by
  then. If your wife is pleased to hand over so large a sum, it is, of course,
  not my affair, but I believe you would do much better to try and think of
  some place where you could leave a portion of it."</p>

  <p>"The money is useless to me," Pamela said. "I make all that I need to live
  on by my work. What I am not altogether happy about, Martin, is my
  father-in-law. Don't you wish to see him, Richard?"</p>

  <p>The man shrank back. The hard lines in his face seemed to have momentarily
  disappeared. He shook himself slightly. He was like a frightened animal.</p>

  <p>"My father," he muttered. "He would never want to see me. He would never
  receive me. If my mother had lived, perhaps&mdash;no, I could not go there.
  Our race do not forgive."</p>

  <p>"Besides, it would be very dangerous," Martin pointed out. "My own advice
  to your husband is that, if he has any plan whatever for getting away, he put
  it into effect quickly. I do not think that he will succeed. No one ever does
  get away for long. But the sooner he tries, the better his chance."</p>

  <p>"I have a plan," Lebur said sullenly. "With that money I can get away if I
  have luck."</p>

  <p>Martin walked with him to the door. Lebur looked back to where Pamela was
  standing.</p>

  <p>"Do you wish me luck, Pamela?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I hope that you may get away," she assured him. "I can say no more. If
  you were not guilty, Richard, it is a cruel life you have had to lead. I hope
  you will not have to go back to it."</p>

  <p>Martin watched him go shuffling down the stairs. He never once looked up
  or back. His shoulders were bent, he carried himself like an old man.
  Martin's expression was very grave indeed as he re-entered the studio.</p>

  <p>"He will never get away, I am afraid, Pamela," he said as he closed the
  door.</p>

  <p>Pamela came across from her desk where she had been writing. She thrust an
  oblong strip of paper into his hand.</p>

  <p>"There is the cheque, Martin," she said. "You are sure that this will not
  bring trouble upon you?"</p>

  <p>He took her arm and led her to the window. She gave a little cry.</p>

  <p>"Fog!"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"He is in luck to start with, anyway. If this thickens, he ought to be
  utterly lost in Wapping."</p>

  <p>She sank into an easy-chair.</p>

  <p>"Martin, dear, would you please go away?" she begged. "I am going to be
  very foolish. I am going to cry. I don't know why, but I am miserable. The
  sight of that man, the sound of his voice, the dread of some harm coming
  quickly to one when he spoke&mdash;Martin, at first he was terrible."</p>

  <p>"I shall stay for a time," he insisted. "You can't be left alone
  here."</p>

  <p>"I tell you what I think would make me happy," she confided. "I will lock
  up here and you shall try and find me a taxi, and go down with me, if you
  will, to Simon Lebur. He will have seen what has happened in the papers. He
  will be very unhappy. It will do him good if I talk to him a little. He has a
  room there he calls my room. Do you mind if I do that, Martin? I will pack a
  little bag."</p>

  <p>"Mind?" he laughed. "You know so well, Pamela, there is no service you
  could not demand from me."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>They descended to the street a quarter of an hour later, Martin carrying
  the bag and steering Pamela across the deserted pavement to where his own car
  was waiting by the kerb. The chauffeur turned on the lights and started the
  engine.</p>

  <p>"Will you be able to drive?" she asked, peering forward. "I shall keep the
  window rubbed quite clean for you this side."</p>

  <p>"I shall see all right," he assured her. "Besides, David, behind there,
  has the eyes of a lynx. He stands up behind and keeps an eye on us all the
  time."</p>

  <p>They moved slowly off, just as a shabby figure in a blue serge suit
  stumbled down the steps of the corner public-house.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p>Martin left his passenger a more than welcome guest at Simon Lebur's flat,
  went round to his club, and then, through sheer nervousness of missing a
  telephone call, dined in his own apartments. At about eleven o'clock that
  night he started out again, drove slowly past Simon Lebur's premises, where
  everything seemed quite normal, and finally brought his car slowly to a
  standstill directly opposite the coffee-stall on the Embankment. He stepped
  lightly out, crossed the broad footway, and established himself on one of the
  deal stools opposite the spot where old Joe himself was standing, polishing
  one by one the long line of cups he was preparing for his night's trade. He
  paused in his task at Martin's approach, and his welcome was without doubt a
  little strained. Martin chose to disregard the fact.</p>

  <p>"Short of customers tonight, Joe," he remarked, lighting a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"It is full early for them yet awhile, sir," the man replied. "So long as
  this fog hangs round, there's never many of them comes out."</p>

  <p>"Bad for trade, eh?"</p>

  <p>"It is that, sir."</p>

  <p>"Well, I will be a customer," Martin observed. "A cup of your best coffee,
  Joe."</p>

  <p>"I will make it specially, sir," Joe promised him. "The urns aren't
  exactly what you might call going yet. You are rather an early visitor, you
  see."</p>

  <p>"I came early," Martin acquiesced, "because I wanted a word with you, Joe,
  without that crowd around. The attentions of your lady clients become a
  little embarrassing at times."</p>

  <p>"Oh, them two!" Joe remarked. "They ain't so bad, sir. They don't hang
  round like some of them. If there is no business about, they sheer off pretty
  quick. It's natural-like, sir," Joe went on, shaking some coffee into a pot,
  "that when they see a gent like you about in a slap-up motorcar, they should
  try for a bit of luck. I don't think they'll be here tonight, though. They
  generally stick in the pubs this weather."</p>

  <p>"The best place for them," Martin agreed. "Joe," he went on, and his voice
  for a hard man was very gracious and friendly, "Joe, you don't need to be
  scared of me."</p>

  <p>Joe glanced towards his coffee-pot, altered its angle a little on the gas
  burner, and recommenced his task of polishing cups.</p>

  <p>"The Inspector was round the other night, sir," he confided a little
  irrelevantly, "him who used to be on this beat many years ago before he got
  promoted. He sits in a swell office now, up at the Yard."</p>

  <p>"What about him?" Martin asked.</p>

  <p>"He got off for a chat, same as you did, sir."</p>

  <p>"A chat about me?"</p>

  <p>"Well, your name did crop up, sir."</p>

  <p>Martin smiled thoughtfully. It was so like Inspector Charlesworth to yield
  now and again to his curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Did he tell you that I was back in the Force as a detective, Joe?"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly that, sir. He did mention the fact that you were still
  worrying about some old case, the last before you came in for that ton of
  money and went to foreign parts."</p>

  <p>"It was a very interesting case, Joe."</p>

  <p>"It ain't one as I cares to talk about."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," Martin agreed. "I can understand that, Joe; but you ought to
  know me well enough to realize that I shouldn't be likely to ask any
  questions that might bring harm upon you or yours."</p>

  <p>Joe paused in his rubbing. He hit the deal counter in front of him with
  his clenched fist and leaned a little towards his patron. There was a flush
  in his cheeks which might have been anger.</p>

  <p>"Then why in hell's name do you come here trying to find out what's become
  of my Sarah?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Martin threw away the stump of his cigarette and lit another.</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, Sarah was in a way interested in that case, wasn't she,
  Joe?"</p>

  <p>"And if she was, why can't you leave the bloody case alone?" Joe demanded.
  "You're like all these blasted dicks, even if you have turned gentleman. You
  can't bear to leave a trail that you haven't finished right up to the
  end."</p>

  <p>"But this case is finished and done with, isn't it, Joe?" Martin asked
  quietly.</p>

  <p>There was positive evil in Joe's bleary eyes as he gazed at his
  persecutor. His voice shook, but he kept his self-control.</p>

  <p>"Of course it's finished with. Lebur went to penal servitude, and lucky he
  was to save his neck. He's in Dartmoor at this present moment."</p>

  <p>Martin shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Oh no, Joe," he contradicted. "You don't keep up with the news these
  days, I see. You don't even read the placards. I am sure your clients, some
  of them, must have been talking about this affair this evening."</p>

  <p>"What affair?" Joe demanded hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Lebur is no longer in Dartmoor," Martin confided. "He escaped two days
  ago. It was in tonight's paper, with his name and everything. Up till ten
  o'clock this evening, at any rate, he was still at liberty."</p>

  <p>The cup that Joe was polishing slipped from his fingers and crashed into
  pieces on the hard ground. Joe leaned forward and his long, yellow-stained
  fingers gripped the rough counter for support.</p>

  <p>"Gawd, is that the truth?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"Certainly it is the truth," Martin assured him. "Richard Lebur's free at
  the present moment and no one knows where he may be."</p>

  <p>Joe was gazing in terrified fashion into the blanket of the disappearing
  fog. There was fear in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"He might come here, of course," Martin went on. "He might come to ask the
  same question that I asked you once, Joe. You weren't very polite to me. I
  don't think that I should answer Richard Lebur's questions if he should come.
  I think you had better tell him what you told me&mdash;to mind my own
  business."</p>

  <p>Behind the counter Joe kept a cut-down stool into which he relapsed
  sometimes when fatigue overcame him. He pulled it out and sank unsteadily
  down upon it.</p>

  <p>"What makes you think that he would come to me?" he faltered.</p>

  <p>"You must have thought me a very clumsy detective, Joe, when I came here
  to ask you for Sarah Rose's address and went away disappointed because you
  would not give it to me."</p>

  <p>"Of course I would not give it to you," Joe growled. "If he came here for
  it, I'd sooner cut his throat than let him have it. For years after the trial
  I used to hear them talking down here as to what could have become of her.
  They none of them thought of asking me. Not that they would have learned
  anything if they had."</p>

  <p>"They never thought of asking you, Joe," Martin repeated quietly,
  "because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aye, because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Because they didn't know that she was your daughter," Martin concluded,
  dropping his voice almost to a whisper.</p>

  <p>This time the old man preserved his self-possession. He set down the cup
  and laid the duster by its side. He folded his arms and from his crouching
  seat upon the stool he looked upwards over the counter.</p>

  <p>"So you've got it off your chest at last," he snarled. "That's why you
  came to me for her address. You knew. You knew that she was my daughter all
  the time."</p>

  <p>"Of course I knew," Martin assented. "I was never much of a
  detective&mdash;in fact, I never even qualified
  properly&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You never had anything to do with Sarah?"</p>

  <p>"Never in my life," Martin assured his questioner. "The first time I saw
  her was when I was called off my beat as a constable to climb the stairs of
  the building where she had a flat and found her screaming over the dead body
  of a man named Culpepper. Now you know all about it, Joe. As I think you
  reminded me just now, this was about the time I came into my fortune. Still,
  I stayed in the Force long enough to do a little work on what they called
  'the Lebur Case,' and I have always been interested in it since as a
  case."</p>

  <p>Joe was nervously locking and unlocking his fingers.</p>

  <p>"You ain't one of them bloody fools who went about after the trial
  declaring that Sarah had done the job and that Lebur was shielding her?" he
  asked fiercely.</p>

  <p>"The idea occurred to me," Martin confessed. "I won't say that I really
  adopted it, but it had occurred to me for a time, as it did to a great many
  other people. You see, that call back when he was led out of the dock, that
  sudden, passionate desire to revert to his plea of 'Not Guilty,' struck a
  great many people as being strange. However, I never seriously believed that
  Sarah had much to do with it. It was just one of the
  possibilities&mdash;then, as it is now. What's the matter with you, Joe? You
  aren't thinking of going, are you?"</p>

  <p>Joe had pulled down his old cap from the peg where it was hanging and was
  struggling into a warm overcoat.</p>

  <p>"I am going to get Tim Bradley to come and look after the stall tonight,"
  he confided. "You will excuse me, sir; I am fair upset with what you have
  been telling me, and I am afraid."</p>

  <p>"Afraid of what, Joe?"</p>

  <p>Joe looked around, stared into the fog as though to penetrate it, and
  dropped his voice.</p>

  <p>"Lebur," he muttered. "If it is true that he is in London, he will want to
  find Sarah. I will say this much for him. He was cruel fond of my girl, was
  Richard Lebur. He won't be able to find her, but he might come to me."</p>

  <p>"You could do as you have done to me&mdash;refuse to tell him," Martin
  observed.</p>

  <p>"Aye, but he is not like you. You have taken it gentlemanlike&mdash;he
  would not. He would do me a harm, Richard Lebur would."</p>

  <p>Martin studied the old man curiously for a few moments.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he said, half to himself, "how much you know about your own
  daughter?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell you this much," was the prompt reply. "If you or anyone else
  was to say a word against her&mdash;I am an old man&mdash;but I'd do for
  you."</p>

  <p>His voice bristled with anger. Martin looked at him in wonderment.</p>

  <p>"Keep quiet, Joe," he begged. "I have said nothing against Sarah."</p>

  <p>"Who ever gave you the right to call her 'Sarah'?" Joe demanded.</p>

  <p>"I apologize," Martin ventured. "Look here, Joe, if you are really
  off&mdash;and I think you are wise to go&mdash;I will take care of the stall
  for you till Tim comes."</p>

  <p>"You don't need, master. He is selling matches at the corner of the bridge
  there and he will be only too glad to come and rest a bit. He will do the job
  all right. There will be no crowd round here tonight, anyway. Nothing like a
  fog for keeping people off the streets. If you take my advice, you will be
  getting home yourself with that fine car of yours."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are right," Martin agreed, as he slipped down from his
  stool.</p>

  <p>The two men lingered together for a few moments on the broad footway.</p>

  <p>"Jump in, Joe," Martin invited. "I will drive you home."</p>

  <p>Joe shook his head. Away from the stall he seemed somehow to look older
  and more feeble. He leaned heavily, too, upon a stick he was carrying.</p>

  <p>"There isn't a soul in this world, except old Tim," Joe declared, "who
  knows where I live, and you ain't going to be the second, Mr. Martin
  Brockenhurst, P.C.&mdash;or whatever you calls yourself nowadays."</p>

  <p>"Don't be such an old fool, Joe," the other replied good-naturedly. "If I
  wanted to know where you live, I could find out in twenty-four
  hours&mdash;but I don't. Garret or palace&mdash;it's all the same to me."</p>

  <p>Old Joe's attention had suddenly wandered. He was leaning heavily on his
  stick and the long bony fingers of his other hand gripped Martin's shoulder.
  He was bending forward, watching someone across the road. The man was making
  his way towards the stall at which the match-vendor had already taken up his
  position. Martin felt his companion's fingers gripping into his
  shoulder-blade. He was breathing quickly.</p>

  <p>"You seed him, Guvnor?" he muttered, scarcely above his breath. "There he
  is. He's talking to Tim now. You know who that was?"</p>

  <p>"I can guess," Martin assented. "It was because I thought he'd make his
  way down here some time that I came. Better get in my car, Joe."</p>

  <p>"Drive me to London Bridge Station," the old man implored. "I'll get out
  there. Promise me you won't follow me any farther."</p>

  <p>"Willingly," Martin acquiesced. "You'll agree with me now as to what he
  has come for, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have told him," Joe answered, as he sprawled into the car. "I
  shouldn't have told him. No one will ever get to know from me."</p>

  <p>Martin was bending over his wheel for a minute or two. As soon as they had
  swung round, however, and he was well on his way over the bridge, he turned
  to his companion.</p>

  <p>"Joe," he said, "it's no good being too obstinate about this matter. That
  was Richard Lebur. You know that without the slightest doubt&mdash;so do I.
  You can guess what he wants&mdash;so can I. He wants Sarah's address."</p>

  <p>The old man moistened his dry lips with a scrap of coloured silk
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"He will never get it from me, never in this world."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Martin asked, slackening pace a little as they approached the
  entrance to the station.</p>

  <p>"I don't want my girl to have naught to do with a criminal," the other
  replied sullenly.</p>

  <p>Martin brought the car to a standstill by the kerb in the front yard of
  the station.</p>

  <p>"They were friends, you know, in the old days, Joe," he reminded him. "You
  know that from what came out at the inquest. She herself admitted that he was
  a frequent visitor."</p>

  <p>"Curse you! Why do you want to remind me of that?" the old man muttered.
  "Listen you here, Mr. Martin," he said, clutching at his sleeve, "just you
  open the door and let me get out."</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment," Martin insisted. "Don't you think you ought to remember
  that Lebur must have been very kind to Sarah, although it was her evidence
  that nearly sent him to the gallows?"</p>

  <p>"She had to tell the truth," Joe groaned. "What do you mean by being
  kind?"</p>

  <p>"Sarah has never wanted for money," Martin observed. "Since the day
  Richard Lebur was driven off in the prison van on the first stage of his
  journey to Dartmoor, Sarah's been well looked after, Joe. Don't you think she
  ought to show a little gratitude to the man who forgave her for pretty well
  swearing his life away?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows that the money comes from him?" the old man asked
  breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Well, it doesn't come from you, does it, Joe?" Martin observed, as he
  leaned over his companion and opened the door of the car. "There you are. I
  shall keep my word. I shan't attempt to follow you. Find your way home and,
  if I were you, I'd let Tim run the coffee-stall for a night or two. And
  there's one thing more, Joe! Keep your daughter away from Richard Lebur, if
  you can, but if he finds her out, don't interfere."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p>Martin drew a little sigh of relief as his front door was swung open
  before he had time to turn his latch-key. Janien, the perfect factotum in his
  quiet indoor livery, was back again at his duties with the air, easily
  recognizable to his master, of one who had successfully accomplished a
  somewhat complicated mission. He preceded Martin into the library, turned on
  the lights, stirred the fire, drew up a small round table by the side of his
  master's favourite easy-chair, and produced whisky and soda from the
  sideboard.</p>

  <p>"Any luck?" the latter asked him.</p>

  <p>"I have discovered the lady's whereabouts, sir," the man announced. "It
  was, after all, a very easy affair. The name under which she is living is on
  the back of this card with the name of the hotel and the number of her suite.
  She has a maid with her, a Miss H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Mason. She calls herself
  French, but I should gather, from her accent, that she is Belgian."</p>

  <p>Martin studied the card for several moments carefully, then he tore it in
  pieces and threw it into the fire.</p>

  <p>"Quick work yours, Janien," he remarked, shaking out an evening newspaper.
  "Did you do it all on your own?"</p>

  <p>"I received some assistance, sir, from the old Headquarters," the man
  admitted. "I may add that they told me, there, that they had never altogether
  lost sight of the lady in question. For some reason or other there have been
  recent enquiries in other directions."</p>

  <p>Martin nodded.</p>

  <p>"What's in the other envelope you are holding?"</p>

  <p>"It's a letter left here by the person who called punctually at the time
  you said, twelve o'clock mid-day," the man explained. "He wrote a note which
  he said was to acknowledge receipt of the packet, and slipped it into the
  envelope containing the other communication which he apparently brought with
  him. He sealed them all up and I kept them here to await your arrival."</p>

  <p>Martin mixed himself a whisky and soda, selected a pipe from a rack over
  the mantelpiece and filled it from a jar of honeydew tobacco.</p>

  <p>"Your enquiries at the Shop were cautiously made, I hope, Janien?"</p>

  <p>"You were not associated with them in any way, sir," the man assured him.
  "I got talking to one of my old companions there and, of course, the case
  came up of this escaped convict from Dartmoor&mdash;Lebur. That led to
  mention of the lady. I just made a remark that I wondered what had become of
  her and I gained the information which I've passed on. I've since had it
  corroborated from another direction."</p>

  <p>"Rather an expensive hotel the young woman seems to have discovered,"
  Martin remarked thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"It has the name of being so, sir," Janien assented. "It possesses, also,
  certain notoriety in other directions."</p>

  <p>"To that," Martin said, "I don't imagine that the young lady would greatly
  object. At the same time, though, under present circumstances, I should have
  thought a quieter part of the world might have been better. Any news of the
  Dartmoor convict, by the bye, Janien?"</p>

  <p>"I have not yet seen the evening papers, sir," the man replied.</p>

  <p>Martin glanced through the stop-press news of the paper which had slipped
  from his knee. The paragraph for which he was looking was nowhere
  present.</p>

  <p>"You won't forget the other envelope that I gave you, sir?" Janien
  reminded him. "The person who left it seemed to think it of some
  importance."</p>

  <p>Martin dropped his papers and picked up the packet. It was addressed to
  himself in block letters. He tore it open, glanced at the receipt, which he
  placed in his pocket, and withdrew the rubber band from five or six hotel
  bills. He looked them through and then turned to the last enclosure, a letter
  written in Lebur's handwriting. He opened it slowly and read. The letter was
  curious from the fact that it had no commencement and no ending.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">I have the thousand pounds. I don't know where it came from
  and I'm not asking. I can only say it is not like my old Dad to part unless
  he had to. You can guess what I am going to do with it&mdash;if you can't, it
  doesn't matter. If I keep going for a single week, it will have been worth my
  while. I shall not regret anything that may happen afterwards.</p>

  <p class="letter">I was never one to accept benefits without doing my best to
  repay them. Enclosed are six hotel bills, any one of which will give you and
  my saintly wife what you desire.</p>

  <p>"Any special orders for tomorrow, sir?" Janien asked, after a final glance
  round his master's bed-chamber an hour or so later.</p>

  <p>"Usual time in the morning," Martin declared. "And I shall be going down
  to Brighton in the afternoon. You can telephone through to the Gigantic for a
  bedroom, with bath and sitting-room."</p>

  <p>"Your own name, sir?"</p>

  <p>Martin looked at him reprovingly.</p>

  <p>"I am out of the profession, Janien, and my new name is not one to play
  tricks with."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, I am sure, sir. Shall you be requiring my
  services?"</p>

  <p>"Probably. You can prepare to come, at any rate. We will go late in the
  afternoon. Get there just in time to have a swim, a cocktail, and change.
  Look up the trains and let me know at luncheon time."</p>

  <p>"Will you be requiring your golf clothes, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing but the tweeds I travel in and my dinner clothes. And,
  Janien&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"My journey is not one to be spoken of&mdash;any telephone enquiries
  before we start&mdash;you know nothing of my movements. The few hours I shall
  spend in Brighton are to be forgotten."</p>

  <p>"I quite understand, sir," the man answered respectfully.</p>

  <p>He closed the door noiselessly and Martin watched his disappearance.</p>

  <p>"Quite understands, does he?" he repeated to himself as he heard the man's
  retreating footsteps mounting the stairs to his own quarters. "I wonder
  whether he does? If so, he is cleverer than I am. I don't understand
  myself...."</p>

  <p>But though Martin closed his eyes, practised deep breathing exercises, and
  counted the sheep passing through the farmer's gate, very little sleep came
  to him that night. He still felt undecided in the morning. At twelve o'clock
  he drove down to Chelsea. He telephoned from the downstairs entrance to say
  that he was on his way up and found Pamela standing on the threshold with the
  door wide open. In the background Leida, her maid, was sewing.</p>

  <p>"It was very considerate of you to telephone, Martin dear," she said.
  "But, you see, I am prepared now for all emergencies. Any fresh news? Tell me
  all about it, please. I have been painting for two hours. Make me a White
  Lady, please&mdash;everything is on the table over there&mdash;and come and
  sit by my side. Leida," she added with a wave of her hand, "you can go."</p>

  <p>The girl took her leave, carrying away her sewing-basket. Martin mixed the
  cocktails and brought them over to the little table by Pamela's side. She was
  seated by her canvas with folded arms.</p>

  <p>"You see," she pointed out, "that little streak of sunshine came and it
  has spoilt my first idea. Never mind, I am tired of painting. Tell me about
  everything. Sit close to me, please. I don't know why, but I am lonely this
  morning."</p>

  <p>She came close to him on the settee, passed her arm through his and leaned
  back for a moment with her head upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Martin," she whispered, "is it all a bad dream? Is he really wandering
  about through the streets here&mdash;free, breathing the air just like you
  and me, tasting the wonders of freedom? No; there would be a difference," she
  added a few seconds later. "His thoughts are chained. They can never escape
  far enough."</p>

  <p>"Where he is just now I do not know," Martin replied. "I was out when he
  came. I had left the money for him and he has taken it away with him, every
  penny. There is his letter."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand in horror.</p>

  <p>"Don't let me see it," she begged. "Please don't."</p>

  <p>"He left also," Martin went on, "this little packet. Perhaps you will not
  understand them so easily as I do. Don't be frightened of touching them,
  dear. They are poor, vulgar documents, but in a way they are the path for us
  to freedom."</p>

  <p>She took them into her hands. She read steadily through three of them.
  Three times it appeared that Mr. and Mrs. Lebur had occupied a double room
  with bath at the Gigantic Hotel at a well-known watering-place, and while
  there had dined expensively and consumed immoderate quantities of liquor.
  They fluttered through her fingers. He shook them from the edge of her
  gown.</p>

  <p>"Why do you show me these loathsome things, Martin?" she protested.</p>

  <p>"He says in that curious letter of his," he replied, "that they are what
  he calls his atonement. I don't know much about the law, Pamela, but I
  believe they would give you what we want&mdash;your freedom."</p>

  <p>She pointed down to them&mdash;a momentary gesture of disgust&mdash;then
  she covered her eyes with her hands and leaned back in his arms. He did
  little to check her quiet sobbing. It was some time before he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Pamela," he said at last, "I think I know what you are feeling, but you
  and I&mdash;we are free from the sort of life where those things count. We
  may stoop to use them for certain reasons&mdash;not for our own sakes, but
  for the sake of others after us."</p>

  <p>She drew a little away from him.</p>

  <p>"Martin," she complained, "I don't understand."</p>

  <p>"For the sake of our children," he answered boldly. "You don't mind my
  reminding you," he added, his arm stealing around her, "that children are a
  possibility of our future life together?"</p>

  <p>Her reaction puzzled him. There was a wild, strange light in her eyes for
  a moment. She drew nearer to him and then farther away.</p>

  <p>"Martin, don't you really know?"</p>

  <p>"Know what?"</p>

  <p>"I ought to have told you," she continued, speaking quietly, almost as
  though to herself. "Do you remember one evening, Martin, in Switzerland,
  during those marvellous days&mdash;it was not long after I'd met you really?
  It was when we were both beginning to be conscious of feeling a curious sort
  of happiness, I think, in being together in all those glorious places,
  amongst the wild flowers and heights where those winds came so wonderfully up
  the valleys and across the mountains! It was an early sunset. We could see
  Grenoble in the far distance and Mont Blanc quite clearly. It was the first
  evening, I think, that I really felt something new and strange stealing into
  life. It came with the smell of those flowers, Martin, and there was
  something fresh and stinging in that evening wind that touched the snows and
  then burned our cheeks."</p>

  <p>"I remember it quite well," he acknowledged. "You were more than ever your
  mystical self that night. We were on our way to Chamonix."</p>

  <p>"I ought to have told you then, Martin," she continued. "Of course, it did
  not seem to matter when I thought of it. It just made things, if possible, a
  little more beautiful. And then"&mdash;she drew her skirt a little farther
  away from one of the papers that had fallen near her foot&mdash;"you asked
  me, if you remember," she went on, "why it gave me so much pleasure to get up
  so early and sit in that strange little church that I loved so much. I nearly
  told you and I didn't. I am a Catholic, Martin."</p>

  <p>He looked down at the papers and a sudden dread seized him.</p>

  <p>"You mean that you wouldn't marry me?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't," she answered. "You know that, Martin. Take those horrible
  things away. Tear them up, tear them up quickly or I shall scream."</p>

  <p>He hesitated for a moment, then slowly he obeyed her. She carried the
  wastepaper basket to the fire and emptied it there. When she came back to him
  she was shivering as though she had done some dreadful thing. She crept into
  his arms. Her slim, beautiful body was strained against his. He felt the rise
  and fall of her breasts against him, felt the passionate grasp of her
  clinging arms.</p>

  <p>"You are not angry, Martin? You are not going to leave me all alone
  because of this? Life has been so hard. I have prayed so long for those Swiss
  days to come back, the days when you began to love me a little. You are not
  going to take it all away? You are not going to leave me all alone with
  nothing but grey thoughts and nothing to feel in my heart and brain but grey
  hopes and queer half-lights? I shall go mad, Martin. Promise me. I shall give
  up my painting. I couldn't do it unless God sent me some colour or dreams or
  hopes of it.... Oh, I am crazy, Martin, I know I am. Don't listen to me; it
  isn't sense. These last few days&mdash;it's all been so terrible."</p>

  <p>Then she felt the sudden tightening of his arms. She saw what she had
  wanted to see in his face; that sudden ghastly burst of selfishness, which
  seems to be man's heritage, left him.</p>

  <p>"My sweetheart," he cried. "You are here and I am with you. What does
  anything else matter? Get your hat on quickly. We are going to have a
  wonderful lunch in my little French place. Then we are going to be reasonable
  and happy."</p>

  <p>"The tears will fall into that beautiful wine of Henri's," she warned
  him.</p>

  <p>"Then we will drink Lacrima Christi," he smiled. "He has three bottles
  left. Absurd!" He laughed as at some small joke of which he was a little
  ashamed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p>Martin Brockenhurst was a man born with that peculiar, but sometimes
  troublesome, instinct which entails real and absolute discomfort to its owner
  when circumstances demand a brief sojourn amongst vulgar surroundings. From
  the moment when he set foot in the huge, over-decorated and yet dingy
  dining-room of the Gigantic Hotel, he was uncomfortable and ill at ease. Not
  even the fact that the ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel, who possessed at any rate
  the genius of discrimination in regard to his patrons, had given him the most
  desirable table for one in the room&mdash;small, in a retired corner, but
  still commanding a view of everything that went on&mdash;could raise his
  spirits. He ordered his dinner without enthusiasm. He chose his wines with
  almost a lackadaisical air. Nothing about him promised the slightest relief
  from his depression. The guests of the hotel, who were soon streaming in,
  were just the class of people whom he was accustomed to spend half his time
  avoiding. The women were over-jewelled, over-peroxidized, and concealed too
  little the superfluity of flesh with which they were encumbered. The men even
  went to the length of wearing white ties with their dinner-coats, smoking
  cigars before they had even ordered their dinner, and talking with an accent
  reminiscent of Leadenhall Street or Smithfield.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, an ill-matched couple&mdash;a demi-mondaine who had learned
  how to wear her clothes, accompanied by a business man whose prosperity
  demanded a certain selective gift in the choice of
  mannequins&mdash;brightened the scene up a little, but a moment later it was
  further depressed by the sight of an entire family from the realms of
  Hampstead&mdash;father, mother, grown-up daughter, and two boys with Eton
  collars&mdash;who depressed once more the average.</p>

  <p>Martin, who was in an almost hypercritical frame of mind, felt the spirit
  of revolt interfering with the fixed purpose with which he had started his
  evening. He even allowed the one person in whom he was chiefly interested to
  enter the room and take a position only a few yards away from his own table,
  with scarcely a glance. It was not until his attention was momentarily
  attracted by the officious politeness of the head waiter to the elder of the
  two ladies, who were now his neighbours, that he realized what had
  happened.</p>

  <p>Janien had made no mistake. There she sat, only a few yards
  away&mdash;more expensively dressed, perhaps, than anyone else in the room,
  and certainly a shade less abominable, notwithstanding the diamonds that
  flashed upon her white neck and her wrists&mdash;old Joe's daughter, the
  mistress of Richard Lebur and many others, the woman who had sent her
  paramour to penal servitude.</p>

  <p>For the first time Martin raised his glass to his lips, found the wine
  excellent and drank half the glassful slowly, with the air of a connoisseur
  and with genuine appreciation. Old Joe's daughter, Sarah, and she hadn't
  recognized him! Her bold eyes had flashed their approval already across the
  empty space which separated them, but it was the approval of a questing
  woman. The light of a continual invitation was there, and the smile which
  slightly parted her lips was the smile which had been the downfall of so many
  of her victims. But she had not recognized him.</p>

  <p>To say that Martin was embarrassed by her unspoken advances would have
  been an exaggeration, but he certainly found some relief in transferring his
  regard for a moment to her companion. The latter was a girl of probably
  between twenty and twenty-five. She was plainly dressed, she wore no
  jewellery, she had good looks of a certain type despite a bad complexion, but
  she showed no signs of wishing to impose them upon anybody. She contented
  herself with eating her dinner calmly and answering her neighbour when she
  was addressed. She was obviously of the companion type, but without any
  affinity in appearance or manners to the woman whose table she shared.</p>

  <p>Martin took the opportunity a few minutes later, whilst his
  vis-&agrave;-vis was indulging in a discussion with the ma&icirc;tre
  d'h&ocirc;tel and both their heads had disappeared behind the huge menu, of
  edging his chair into a slightly different angle. He asked his own waiter a
  question a moment or two later.</p>

  <p>"Do you know the name of the lady opposite?" he asked. "The one in black
  with the diamonds."</p>

  <p>The waiter smiled, a little impudently, Martin fancied.</p>

  <p>"There's many of the gentlemen who visit down here who have asked me that,
  sir," he replied. "Her name is Culpepper."</p>

  <p>Martin was a little startled.</p>

  <p>"No connection, I hope, with the David Culpepper who was murdered by the
  escaped convict from Dartmoor for whom the police are searching the whole of
  this part of England?" he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know anything about that, sir," the man replied. "She registered
  as Mrs. Culpepper and the young lady with her, who seems to be a sort of
  companion, as Miss H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Mason. The elder lady," he continued,
  leaning a little forward and dropping his voice, "is not on very good terms
  with the management just now. She's too fond, they think, of recognizing old
  acquaintances amongst the gentlemen who come here."</p>

  <p>Martin dismissed the man with a little nod and returned to his study of
  the evening paper, which he propped up in front of him. A minute or two later
  the man with whom Sarah had been in consultation regarding the menu presented
  himself respectfully.</p>

  <p>"You will excuse me, sir," he begged, "but the lady opposite has asked me
  to give you this card. She assures me that you are an old acquaintance and
  she would be glad if you would take your coffee with her in the Winter Garden
  in half an hour's time."</p>

  <p>Martin turned the card over speculatively, glanced across the room, and
  ventured upon a slight bow.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell the lady that I shall be delighted," he said.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>So, half an hour later, Martin found himself bowing over Sarah's pudgy
  fingers in the retired corner of the palm court which he had chosen. Sarah
  looked about her with some disappointment.</p>

  <p>"Didn't mean to advertise yourself tonight, did you?" she remarked.</p>

  <p>"I prefer the quiet corners in a lounge of this description," he
  confessed. "Don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I don't," she answered. "What's the use of wearing twenty
  thousand pounds' worth of diamonds if you hide away in a corner with no one
  to see them or to know that you are wearing a French gown?"</p>

  <p>"That's all very well for you ladies," Martin observed. "But I don't think
  anyone would recognize where my trousers came from or who built my coat, and,
  as you see, my signet-ring is the only jewellery I can display."</p>

  <p>"You men are so selfish," she remarked, settling herself upon the settee,
  her full skirt flowing about her with certainly the right amount of
  fashionable negligence.</p>

  <p>"What did you think when you got my card, and who are you, please?"</p>

  <p>"You said you remembered me."</p>

  <p>"I do, but I have forgotten where we met."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps if you remembered," he said, "you would not have invited me."</p>

  <p>She leaned a little forward.</p>

  <p>"I know whom you remind me of, anyway," she acknowledged, staring hard at
  him. "You have grown better-looking and you carry yourself better. But you
  remind me tremendously of a policeman who once nearly took me into
  custody."</p>

  <p>"Quite right," he assured her. "I have changed my name since then, though.
  I was P. C. Campbell and I was called in after a man had been shot in your
  flat."</p>

  <p>"What a memory!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"It was almost my last case before I left the Force," he went on. "A very
  interesting one, too."</p>

  <p>"It was perfectly awful," she declared. "Please don't let's talk of it. I
  can never think of that night without a shiver. Do you know that it was the
  murdered man who left me all these diamonds I am wearing?"</p>

  <p>"How should I?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He was rich and he was generous, was David Culpepper," she went on with
  an affected sigh. "We were to have been married. However, I don't want to
  talk about him now, no more than you do. There are plenty of other things of
  interest in the world."</p>

  <p>"Was Culpepper as much in love with you as Lebur?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"They were all in love with me, or said they were, in those days," she
  giggled. "I can't say that I found you very sympathetic, though."</p>

  <p>"A policeman has to keep his feelings under control," Martin reminded her.
  "There was a dead man lying almost across your mat and I wasn't at all sure
  that you weren't the person who had shot him."</p>

  <p>"Ugh! I never let off a gun in my life. Besides, why should I shoot a man
  who was madly in love with me?"</p>

  <p>"No reason that I know of," he admitted. "But I didn't see what you were
  doing with a man's revolver in your rooms if you didn't know how to use
  it."</p>

  <p>"It was Richard Lebur himself made me take it," she confided. "He knew how
  crazy some of those men used to get. The worst of having friends who are too
  affectionate!"</p>

  <p>"I've had no experience in that direction," Martin observed.</p>

  <p>"Well, Richard Lebur knew that I didn't shoot David Culpepper, at any
  rate," she observed. "I don't suppose anyone could ever have thought that I
  would do such a thing. If so, it was just as well that Richard pleaded
  guilty."</p>

  <p>"I often wondered what made him change his plea," Martin reflected.</p>

  <p>"Changed it to save his neck," she declared. "There was never any doubt
  about that. He had a way with him, Richard Lebur, but he was a white-livered
  creature&mdash;he had no courage."</p>

  <p>"He had the courage to break out of Dartmoor, anyhow," Martin reminded
  her.</p>

  <p>"He&mdash;he what?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>Martin suddenly remembered that it was quite likely that she had not
  noticed the name of the escaped convict which had appeared in the papers. He
  held out the brandy he had ordered. She took a long sip from the glass he
  pressed to her lips.</p>

  <p>"When did he break out?" she faltered.</p>

  <p>Her face was ghastly under its coating of rouge. Despite himself he was
  sorry for her.</p>

  <p>"Several days ago," he confided. "He is still at liberty."</p>

  <p>"Why haven't they caught him?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"I suppose they have done their best," he answered. "Lebur must have had
  friends who have been helping him. His father is a rich man, you know, and he
  would have plenty of opportunity of getting money."</p>

  <p>"It isn't money he would be looking for when he got out," she said
  breathlessly. "It's me."</p>

  <p>"I had the same thought when I saw you sitting there tonight," he replied.
  "I don't suppose he would be too happy to walk in just now, would he, and see
  you wearing all David Culpepper's diamonds and staying at a hotel like
  this?"</p>

  <p>"Let's go up to my sitting-room," she proposed, rising to her feet. "I am
  frightened."</p>

  <p>"Forgive me, but I think that would be a little worse," he objected,
  shaking his head. "If he succeeded in tracing you down here, he would also
  succeed in finding out what name you were living under. I should advise you
  in a few minutes to make your way to your own room and stay there for a time.
  You have a companion who looks an intelligent girl. She had better warn the
  management against letting strange visitors know that you are here."</p>

  <p>"You will stand by me, anyhow, if he forces his way in?" she demanded.
  "You know that the murder was nothing to do with me. You were there."</p>

  <p>"I was not there when the murder was committed," he reminded her. "To this
  day I have not the faintest idea who killed David Culpepper."</p>

  <p>"It was Richard Lebur," she almost shrieked. "Why, everyone knew that he
  was guilty. If he hadn't changed his plea and had a soft-hearted judge, he
  would have been hanged."</p>

  <p>"Do please listen to me for a moment, Mrs. Culpepper, if that is your
  present name," he begged.</p>

  <p>"I have to call myself something," she declared truculently. "He was more
  my husband than anyone. He left me some of his money and all his jewels. Why
  shouldn't I take his name? I should think it would please him."</p>

  <p>"It's of no consequence to me," he assured her, "whose name you take."</p>

  <p>"Well, the case is over and done with, isn't it?" she asked. "He was found
  guilty. It can't be opened again and they can't take these jewels away from
  me."</p>

  <p>"They certainly can't do that," he admitted. "The man left them to you in
  his will and they were certainly his to leave. Now, please calm yourself. I
  have seen one or two people glance over in our direction and, the name of the
  escaped convict having been on the placards, people might naturally associate
  you with him. You have not sold any of the jewels I see, then?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" she demanded angrily. "I have plenty of money of my
  own."</p>

  <p>"David Culpepper didn't leave much," Martin remarked.</p>

  <p>"How do you know he didn't give me some before he died?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"That's quite true," Martin acknowledged, "and it isn't my business,
  anyway. But, listen, if you will, to me for a moment. I have known old Simon
  Lebur ever since I was a boy, and I like him. I can't help thinking that, if
  his son gets in touch with him, they will do their best to get this case
  reopened."</p>

  <p>"How can they?" she demanded. "It was properly tried in court and Richard
  Lebur pleaded 'Guilty.' He can't take that back."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose he can," Martin admitted. "But there's just one thing I
  would like to ask you, since the subject has come up&mdash;do you yourself
  believe that Richard Lebur killed Culpepper?"</p>

  <p>"Who else could it have been?" she demanded. "You aren't going to suggest
  that it was I?"</p>

  <p>"Not likely," he answered. "But can you think of anyone else who might
  possibly have been guilty?"</p>

  <p>"Not a soul," was the firm rejoinder. "There was no one else in the
  flat."</p>

  <p>"The hall-porter, who was absent from his office when he should have been
  there, was a very unconvincing witness," Martin observed. "He admitted having
  been across at the public-house when he ought to have been on duty and at the
  inquest he got completely confused."</p>

  <p>"Nothing to do with me," the woman replied. "So long as I lived at Byron
  Court there were bound to be men on the stairs. Someone might have been
  waiting for me and never come up. I can't be responsible for them. There was
  no one else came to my rooms. That I have sworn to in court, though I was
  afraid it would mean Richard Lebur being hung. I was too frightened that
  someone might try to put it on me to tell anything but the truth that
  time."</p>

  <p>"Well, anyhow, I won't bother you with any more questions," Martin
  promised. "So far as you are concerned, I don't suppose anyone else ever
  will. But I must warn you that Richard Lebur is at liberty. You admitted in
  your evidence that he was furiously jealous and madly in love with you. If he
  tries to find you, he might very easily succeed. This is a well-known place.
  If I were you, I should lock myself up and then get across to the Continent
  for a few days. Go to Paris or Monte Carlo. It's good advice. Remember, if he
  found you out down here, he would not be able to get a passport to follow you
  abroad."</p>

  <p>"What's that? Tell me that again," she begged.</p>

  <p>"It's just as I said it," Martin told her. "Lebur has no passport,
  naturally, and he couldn't possibly apply for one. You hire a car to take you
  to Dover and catch the midnight boat to Calais and you will be safe."</p>

  <p>"Come with me," she begged. "I will give you anything in the world you
  want. My diamond necklace&mdash;anything. I am afraid to go alone to a
  strange country. I have always been like that, and I need a man with me. You
  don't look married&mdash;are you?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not married," Martin assured her. "But I'm next door to it and I
  could not possibly do as you ask. I have given you good advice. Everyone
  speaks a little English in France nowadays. You will have to go back to your
  own name to get your own passport, but that will be all the better. Your
  companion looks a sensible girl. She will be able to help you."</p>

  <p>"She speaks French!" the woman almost screamed. "My God, I had forgotten
  all about her."</p>

  <p>"You go and talk it over with her at once," Martin begged.</p>

  <p>She caught at his hands. They were almost alone in the Winter Garden. The
  old glint was back again in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I would rather have a man," she said wistfully. "You look so strong and
  capable. I have plenty of money. It won't cost you anything. Come with
  me."</p>

  <p>"What you are asking is quite impossible," he answered. "I am on my way to
  London now."</p>

  <p>"You have a suite here; the ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel told me so."</p>

  <p>"But I have changed my mind. Do just as I have suggested and you will be
  safe from any trouble with Lebur. If he comes here and finds you alone with
  me, you will be asking for it. You see, I am being brutal."</p>

  <p>A quick turn on his heel and he was free from her partly attempted
  embrace. He looked back at her from the entrance and waved his hand. Three
  minutes later he was in his room with the door locked.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>With the placid dignity which he had chosen as his middle-age poise,
  Inspector Charlesworth rose from his comfortable seat at a corner table in
  the Restaurant St. Germain to greet his host.</p>

  <p>"Began to think you weren't coming, Martin," he observed. "Distinctly
  against discipline for you even to telephone me. I told you I was not having
  any more of that damned Lebur case."</p>

  <p>"You were not serious?" Martin suggested. "You are really as much
  interested in the case as I am, and directly I read of Lebur's escape, I knew
  that we should be coming together again before long."</p>

  <p>"I have not reopened it," the Inspector reminded his host. "You wrote and
  asked me to dine here in a friendly way."</p>

  <p>"Well, here I am. It's a good place to dine and we have other things to
  talk about if necessary," Martin reminded him. "As to my being ten minutes
  late, I apologize. You will understand why when you have heard my little
  narrative."</p>

  <p>"It's the Lebur case, then," the Inspector exclaimed. "By Jove, you are
  persistent, at any rate!"</p>

  <p>"So were you in your younger days," Martin reminded him. "Now then,
  Inspector, out with it! Shall it be another of the same or will you try one
  of my own?"</p>

  <p>"Anything sooner than another of the same," the Inspector declared with
  emphasis. "I'd rather be poisoned more pleasantly."</p>

  <p>Martin tore a page from his pocket-book and scribbled a few lines upon it.
  He then sent for the barman.</p>

  <p>"Two of these, James," he told him. "Well shaken and, if lemons are out of
  fashion, two teaspoonfuls of lime juice."</p>

  <p>"Right away, sir," the man promised.</p>

  <p>"To give you an appetite for your drink," Martin proposed, "I will ask you
  a conundrum. Who shot David Culpepper?"</p>

  <p>"Why, the woman, of course," the Inspector declared. "I have gone into it
  thoroughly since you disappeared. Culpepper had left her quite a good deal of
  money and all his first wife's jewels, which everyone knows were well worth
  having. Of course, she shot him&mdash;who would not for jewels worth one
  hundred thousand pounds?"</p>

  <p>"How did she get a pair of gloves on and off in the time?" Martin asked.
  "You did the searching yourself. You admitted that there were no gloves she
  could have worn anywhere about the place. Lebur's finger-prints were as clear
  as possible."</p>

  <p>"I am disappointed in you, Martin," the Inspector sighed.</p>

  <p>"Well, tell me what you think of this drink that is coming. It's supposed
  to have a stimulating effect on the brain."</p>

  <p>The Inspector drank his cocktail at a gulp.</p>

  <p>"It's given mine a jog," he admitted. "I am perfectly convinced that you
  know who did it, but it was not Sarah Culpepper, as they tell me she calls
  herself now. But if I dine with you every night for a month, you won't tell
  me who did it."</p>

  <p>Martin held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"I shake hands with you, Inspector," he declared, "because you are the
  nearest man I can find to the man who gave me the recipe for that cocktail.
  You may have missed a point or two, but I believe if I left you alone you
  would arrive at precisely where I have arrived."</p>

  <p>"Your appreciation overwhelms me," the other acknowledged. "Get to work
  and order dinner. I have four men out tonight and I want their reports before
  I get home."</p>

  <p>Martin called the ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel&mdash;suave, dark, with shiny
  black hair and a knowing twinkle in his eyes. They conferred together for a
  minute or two, after which the waiter retired. The flames stole higher round
  the bars of the grill and the first stages of a very pleasant little meal
  were set in being. A repetition of the secret <i>ap&eacute;ritif</i> was
  followed by an order for a bottle of Beaujolais, slightly warmed, to be ready
  with the <i>poussin</i>.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if by chance you saw anything of Lebur on his leave of absence?"
  Charlesworth enquired with an almost lamblike meekness.</p>

  <p>"If I did, Inspector, I should not burden you with the knowledge," was the
  quiet reply.</p>

  <p>The Inspector crossed two fingers. Martin nodded in understanding.</p>

  <p>"I did, and I was sorry for the poor devil," Martin confessed. "He looked
  ill and tired and weary of life. I only hope he gets what he broke loose
  for."</p>

  <p>"The heroine of the tragedy?" Charlesworth queried.</p>

  <p>"Two yeses," Martin assented. "He had his chance, at any
  rate&mdash;whether he found it worth while, I don't know. One is generally
  disappointed in these big efforts, and Sarah Culpepper, as you may have
  heard, Inspector, was very much playing the grande dame."</p>

  <p>"Seen her yourself?" the Inspector asked once more.</p>

  <p>"Inquisitive old devil, aren't you? Yes, I have seen her. She didn't send
  her love to you, if that is what you are worrying about."</p>

  <p>"Were you present at the happy reunion?"</p>

  <p>"There or thereabouts," Martin admitted. "Upon my word, there is no man I
  have hated worse, but I was almost sorry for Richard Lebur. If he's been
  sitting chopping sticks on Dartmoor all these years with only one desire in
  his body and that to pass the rest of his days with this woman, I am sorry
  for him. I forget who it was who said so&mdash;one of our filthy decadents,
  of course&mdash;but it very nearly got into the <i>Select Book of Verse</i>
  for the year. 'The Harlot of Hampstead Hill,' it was called&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me any more," Charlesworth begged. "I hate that sort of muck.
  The only prison poem I have ever been able to read was 'The Ballad of Reading
  Gaol.'"</p>

  <p>"That was an epic," Martin observed. "A really great piece of work. An
  extract from that has appeared just lately in the <i>Oxford Book of Modern
  Verse</i>. Let's forget this stuff. Charlesworth, tell me&mdash;you can
  afford to&mdash;I am not asking who is on the job&mdash;I have a pretty good
  idea&mdash;but are you going to lay your hands on Lebur?"</p>

  <p>"Not if I can help it," the Inspector confided. "But, remember, we have
  the prison authorities to bear in mind, and it's a crushing blow to them if
  they let a prisoner get away and he is not trapped and brought back again.
  Otherwise, so far as I am personally concerned, I'd be glad to know that he
  was clean out of it."</p>

  <p>"And why?"</p>

  <p>"Because I don't believe he was guilty. He wasn't a pleasant character. I
  have always understood that his domestic relations were unhappy. I have heard
  neither man nor woman say a good thing about him, but I don't think he killed
  David Culpepper. He had the pluck to break out of prison and without
  bloodshed, without mauling a warder about, or anything of that sort. He can
  never re-establish his life here in England, and I hope he finds his way
  somewhere where he can start again, and takes the woman with him."</p>

  <p>"The object of our little dinner is achieved so far as I am concerned. I
  don't mind confessing," Martin went on, "that there was a time, not long ago,
  when I should have liked him out of the way for other reasons. But it's too
  late to hope for that. Let your men go easy on him, Charlesworth, and I will
  stand you one of those Lord-Mayor-looking Larranagas."</p>

  <p>"I will smoke it for you," Charlesworth promised.</p>

  <p>Just at that moment a woman, expensively dressed in the prevailing mode,
  that of half evening dress, with a few too many diamonds and a little too
  much swagger, sailed into the place, followed a yard or two behind by the
  subject of their conversation and the cause of their t&ecirc;te-
  &agrave;-t&ecirc;te dinner.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>"Did you pay the bill?" Inspector Charlesworth asked, choking in the back
  seat of the taxi-cab a few seconds later.</p>

  <p>"I didn't. Nor did I dispense a single tip," Martin confessed.
  "Notwithstanding those slight drawbacks, it was a brilliant getaway,
  Inspector. I think the chef was the only one who really saw us go down his
  passage and I am perfectly certain that the beautiful Sarah hadn't an idea
  who we were. She was far too occupied in ogling the gigolo with the violin.
  Lebur, fortunately, has almost lost his sight, working out of doors in the
  clear, hard light of Dartmoor. Monsieur Degroutte, the manager, will have one
  on us for the rest of his life&mdash;one high official of Scotland Yard and
  another retired detective bolting from his place like rabbits to avoid a
  famous criminal!"</p>

  <p>"Degroutte must keep his mouth shut about it," Charlesworth muttered.</p>

  <p>"Hope you will close his place for him if he doesn't," was Martin's grim
  response.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p>Martin looked across the table at his companion with an air of
  astonishment. He had been sharing a simple meal with Pamela in the
  dining-room of her flat. The window which looked over the gardens and down to
  the River was open and a gentle, very softly blowing breeze was stealing
  in.</p>

  <p>"Martin," she said suddenly, "I am going to ask you something
  ridiculous."</p>

  <p>"What a joy!" he answered. "You are so far away from things ridiculous
  most days."</p>

  <p>"I should like to be taken out&mdash;where do you think?"</p>

  <p>He reflected.</p>

  <p>"There's a new Russian Ballet."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Somewhere to dance."</p>

  <p>"What! Just ordinary dancing?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Aren't I crazy? I haven't wanted to dance for years&mdash;tonight I do. I
  should like some swing music, a good floor, and an occasional waltz. Please
  let's go somewhere."</p>

  <p>"My dear, you don't need to ask me." He smiled. "Nothing would give me
  more pleasure. I have not played golf for a week. I have been sitting in
  easy-chairs, being lectured by our friend the Inspector, until I am sure I
  have put on pounds. Is it exercise or sentiment, Pamela, which has produced
  this sudden desire?"</p>

  <p>"Both," she sighed. "But I want that strange semi-Oriental, semi-Negro
  music. I want to move my feet differently."</p>

  <p>He reflected.</p>

  <p>"Any special place?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You know I never go out at night, Martin," she said. "If I go out at all
  it is to play the piano to Simon Lebur or to one of Morenstein's recitals.
  But I should like to dance, and especially I should like to dance with you.
  Help yourself to cigarettes, please. Take some more coffee if you
  like&mdash;it is still hot. I must change my shoes and stockings. I need not
  change my frock, need I? I shall be all right like this at any of the
  restaurants or little clubs?"</p>

  <p>He smiled quietly. She was wearing a soft grey dress with a little touch
  of lace at the throat, closely fitting and beautifully modelled.</p>

  <p>"I belong to a night-club," he said. "I don't suppose you have ever been
  to one, Pamela?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think that I have," she admitted. "But I may come, mayn't I?"</p>

  <p>"Rather," he answered. "It's run by an old friend of mine. She will be
  very flattered."</p>

  <p>"I go to change," Pamela announced.</p>

  <p>Martin lit another cigarette. Pamela had been in one of her strange moods
  that evening. She had eaten very little and, as usual, drunk even less, but
  there was all the time a restlessness in her manner which seemed suddenly to
  have found expression in this queer desire of hers for movement. She was away
  for only a few minutes, and when she returned she was followed by Leida,
  carrying her light fur wrap. The girl greeted Martin respectfully.</p>

  <p>"It is not for long that I have kept Madame," she said.</p>

  <p>"It has seemed long, naturally, Leida," Martin answered. "But that was not
  your fault. She makes the seconds seem long when she is absent."</p>

  <p>"Racine," Pamela murmured.</p>

  <p>"What a memory, dear friend!"</p>

  <p>"And what a courteous speech! You have your car?"</p>

  <p>"Really, I think I am most devoted these days. I remember even your hatred
  of taxis. The young moon can find gold spots in your hair."</p>

  <p>"If you talk like that as we dance, Martin," she smiled, as they descended
  the stairs, "I shall think that we are in Switzerland again. Of course, you
  remember that it was in Switzerland with all that wonderful, flowery setting
  that you began to say those delightful things to me?"</p>

  <p>"I have never left off thinking them," he assured her.</p>

  <p>"I wonder how it is," she said, as she took her place in the car and Leida
  spread the cover around them, "that, though one may think those things so
  often, it is not always that one feels inclined to say them? What a pity it
  is too late, Martin, or we could drive in the gardens at Kew!"</p>

  <p>"Another time," he answered. "You have inspired me with the desire for
  movement. See how restfully my little Rolls is slipping in and out of these
  back streets. We shall dance like that tonight, Pamela."</p>

  <p>She moved her arms gently, swaying a little in her place. Her right arm
  rested upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"It distracts you, that?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Immeasurably," he replied. "While it stays there I could time my angle to
  a quarter of an inch."</p>

  <p>"Isn't your dancing-club in rather a queer locality?" she asked, as they
  turned away from Regent Street.</p>

  <p>"It's a queer place," he told her. "They do strange things there. They
  even tried to poison me."</p>

  <p>"Don't let's go near the place," Pamela begged. "How can you even tell me
  of anything so dreadful?"</p>

  <p>"It was not really dreadful at all," he assured her. "It was a stupid
  boy's blunder."</p>

  <p>They drew up in a little square space left for parking cars, crossed the
  road, and entered the "Evening Star." At first it seemed to them that the
  place was empty; then they heard the low moaning of the violin and the sound
  of welcoming voices. Diana left the party of young people she was with at the
  bar and came forward to greet them.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Martin, what a stranger!" she exclaimed. "How nice of you to
  come at last, though, and to bring anyone so attractive!" she added, with a
  smile.</p>

  <p>"This is Mrs. Lebur, Diana, whose pastels you loved so much and whose
  strange picture you were asking me about only last time I was here&mdash;the
  picture of the old man seated at the window."</p>

  <p>"My dear," Diana exclaimed, "I am delighted! How good of you to come! I
  hope you have not had supper?"</p>

  <p>"We dined a little late," Pamela admitted. "But I have a little flat that
  looks over the River and I live with the windows open, and I think that is
  why I am always hungry."</p>

  <p>"Your usual table, when you do honour us, Martin," Diana pointed out, "is
  free. I always keep it empty as long as I can in case you turn up. Here comes
  Antoine. I believe our chef," she went on to Pamela, "would forgive me if I
  went down to his kitchen and insisted upon cooking one of the dishes, but
  Antoine, my chief ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel, would never permit me to show a
  distinguished client to his table. May I come and talk to you presently,
  please?"</p>

  <p>"Do," Pamela begged. "We shall be delighted. I am not very good at the new
  steps," she added, "and I expect Martin will want to find someone else to
  dance with him before long."</p>

  <p>"Plenty of girls here tonight," Diana observed. "A good many of your
  favourites, too, Martin&mdash;if you have any. They call Mr. Brockenhurst
  'St. Anthony' here, you know, Mrs. Lebur. He resists temptation wherever he
  finds it."</p>

  <p>"If he resists it here," she replied, as they stepped on to the
  dancing-floor, "I think that he must be immune."</p>

  <p>"I like your young lady friend," Pamela murmured, as they glided away.
  "Oh, Martin, why did I ever leave off dancing? This is wonderful!"</p>

  <p>"One more joy come back to life," he acquiesced. "I don't care if this man
  calls himself the leader of a jazz band or a swing band, or anything&mdash;he
  has the soul of a musician. Pamela, I am loving it."</p>

  <p>"And I," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"You are so light," he whispered. "I could lift you from the floor and
  throw you up to the ceiling."</p>

  <p>"And you feel so strong&mdash;such perfection," she said half to herself,
  "that I can't think honestly. Martin, I can't believe&mdash;" She
  stopped.</p>

  <p>"I was not at all impatient," he reminded her, "but you didn't finish your
  sentence."</p>

  <p>"I couldn't," she answered. "What fools we women are, Martin, dear. I
  ought to have known that this was the one thing I should have avoided."</p>

  <p>There was a soft note of pleasant mockery in his laugh. It came back long
  afterwards when he led her from the floor to their table. She walked almost
  as though she were in a stupor. Her hand clutched at his wrist.</p>

  <p>"It is necessary," he told her, as they gained their places, "that we
  order some supper."</p>

  <p>"Anything," she begged.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he objected. "I have a reputation to keep up here, Pamela.
  They call me <i>a bon viveur</i>. By the bye, the last time I tried to eat
  simply here it nearly cost me my life. I ordered a ham sandwich. It turned
  out afterwards&mdash;although I never got the whole truth of it&mdash;that it
  was flavoured with strychnine."</p>

  <p>"What a horrible story!"</p>

  <p>"It isn't pleasant, is it?" he agreed. "Tonight I think we will
  have&mdash;if that suits you&mdash;a <i>petite demoiselle</i> lobster with
  mayonnaise, and a bottle of Piesporter."</p>

  <p>"Delicious," she murmured.</p>

  <p>They gave their order and she accepted a cigarette from his case.</p>

  <p>"No wonder you leave my shabby window-seat and my dull little River so
  early at night, Martin!"</p>

  <p>"It would take more than this, Pamela, to drag me away if I thought it
  made a great deal&mdash;a very great deal&mdash;of difference to you," he
  whispered.</p>

  <p>Her hand crept out to his across the table. She looked fearlessly into his
  eyes and the light that shone in hers was rather like the light that blazes
  from the star in a star opal.</p>

  <p>"You should know, Martin," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>The secretary, a ponderous, slow-moving person, came out from his office,
  crossed the floor&mdash;deserted for a few minutes by the dancing
  crowd&mdash;and bowed a greeting to Martin at his table.</p>

  <p>"You read the report of our case, Mr. Brockenhurst?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>Martin nodded.</p>

  <p>"An extraordinary affair," he remarked. "It does not seem to me that the
  police are particularly intelligent. They have not even found out where the
  strychnine came from, who was the purchaser, or who put it on the sandwich.
  No wonder they had to adjourn the inquest!"</p>

  <p>"There's still no evidence on either of these points, sir," the secretary
  regretted. "There's not even any evidence as to whether it was known in the
  kitchens that the sandwiches were for you."</p>

  <p>"Shouldn't think so," Martin observed. "I don't believe I have an enemy in
  the world."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't think so, either," the secretary agreed. "I thought you would
  like to know that the adjourned inquest takes place tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Martin nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, I have wasted one hour on the affair already," he said. "I
  certainly shan't go again. I'm not even subp&oelig;naed."</p>

  <p>The secretary lingered for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is useless to ask you, sir, whether you have any ideas on
  the subject?" he enquired wistfully. "You have never had occasion to speak
  severely to any of the waiters here or anything of that sort? We have one or
  two Italians who are apt to be a little troublesome sometimes, and if there
  is any bad feeling about the place, what we want to do is to get rid of
  it."</p>

  <p>Martin shook his head decisively.</p>

  <p>"I don't remember," he remarked, "ever having had to find the slightest
  fault with anyone even remotely connected with the service."</p>

  <p>The secretary bowed and took his leave. Pamela watched him with wondering
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"How strange that he should come and ask you questions like that!" she
  observed.</p>

  <p>"The fellow's a fool," Martin remarked. "Only one of the sandwiches was
  poisoned at all, and the chef who cut them didn't know for whom they were
  ordered."</p>

  <p>"But they were for you?" she persisted.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, as a matter of fact, they were," he admitted. "I didn't feel hungry
  but I wanted something, so I ordered ham sandwiches. Don't let's think
  anything more about it, Pamela, or you won't have any appetite for your
  lobster."</p>

  <p>She laughed gaily. The waiter had already wheeled up a service table and
  was dissecting a small lobster. Whilst they were being served with the
  mayonnaise the chef himself crossed the floor and bowed to Martin.</p>

  <p>"I appreciate very much your confidence, Mr. Brockenhurst, in paying us
  another visit," he said. "We have sent away half of our staff because of that
  last unfortunate affair and we have a new overseer of the kitchen specially
  appointed. Your present order&mdash;I took the young lobster myself from the
  pan, where he was still alive. I prepared him and I mixed the mayonnaise
  myself. Having done that, I placed him on the dish and I stood at the door
  till he was wheeled to your table. Madame and Monsieur need not have the
  slightest anxiety."</p>

  <p>They both assured him that they had none at all and he took his leave with
  another series of profound bows. The lobster was excellent, the wine was
  marvellous.</p>

  <p>"Why don't we do this every night?" Martin asked.</p>

  <p>"I love the place, Martin. Do you think they would make me a member?"</p>

  <p>"You are one from this moment," he answered. "It shall be my Whitsuntide
  present to you."</p>

  <p>They danced until the small hours, then Diana came back to their table and
  they talked for some time. The moon shone down upon them and they drove
  slowly home at two o'clock in the morning.</p>

  <p>"Stop at the studio, please," Pamela begged, as they turned into her
  street.</p>

  <p>"My dear&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly because he knew that the doors to the flat itself
  would be locked. He felt her arm, which had been resting on his sleeve, very
  slowly withdrawn. She lifted her eyes to his as he drew up outside the green
  door.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I left something here," she said. "You don't mind coming up with
  me while I look for it? To tell you the truth, I am rather afraid to go in
  alone."</p>

  <p>"Of course I don't mind," he answered, wondering why his hand which was
  clutching the brake was shaking. "I shouldn't dream of letting you mount the
  stairs alone, Pamela."</p>

  <p>She passed him the key. He opened the door and closed it behind them. They
  were in pitch darkness. Then she turned on a single light and they stumbled
  up the stairs into the studio&mdash;grey and ghostly it seemed with the
  single light which was the only illumination in the place. Suddenly he felt
  her arms around his neck. Her warm lips were close to his cheek, whispering
  into his ear.</p>

  <p>"Martin, I have been thinking&mdash;I have been thinking. I believe I am a
  deadly selfish woman."</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked, struggling to control his voice and striving to look away
  into the dark, lonely stretches of the room.</p>

  <p>"Those papers," she whispered. "They meant so much to you."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps they did. I forgot!"</p>

  <p>"I want to know how much. To me they meant nothing. You know what our
  Creed says. You will understand when I say that to me they meant
  nothing&mdash;but you, Martin, to you they meant everything."</p>

  <p>He was suddenly conscious of the straining of her arms. The vibration in
  her voice held something new. His pulses were beating fast. They seemed full
  of the strangest and most wonderful music. For a single moment he hesitated.
  Then the fury of indecision passed.</p>

  <p>"Pamela," he begged, "will you please wait for forty-eight hours before
  you judge me?"</p>

  <p>He felt the change as she lowered her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I am your slave, Martin," she said. "What is it you desire?"</p>

  <p>"You first, you more than anything in life."</p>

  <p>"But in your own way only?" she interrupted.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Your promise is to be that you suspend your judgment," he reminded her.
  "Will you give me tomorrow and the next day?"</p>

  <p>"I have offered you my life," she reminded him.</p>

  <p>"I shall be here," he told her, "at nine o'clock in the morning. You will
  need a suit-case. We shall be away for the two days."</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes once more. He felt the fire of them. It was as though
  she was striving to grope into the back of his brain.</p>

  <p>"At half-past nine," she said quietly, "I shall be here with a suit-case,
  ready to obey your orders."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p>Pamela that next morning might have been the heroine of that almost
  forgotten "Spenserian" poem of Springtime&mdash;"The Gay Lady of Surprise."
  She opened the door to Martin herself, followed by Leida, carrying her modern
  suit-case. She walked down the stairs, her hands extended, her eyes dancing,
  colour on her cheeks&mdash;the very spirit of happiness in her walk.</p>

  <p>"Confess now that I am an amazement, Martin," she cried, as she took his
  hands and, leaning over, kissed him lightly on the cheek. "Here I am, with no
  lines under my eyes, no signs of a sleepless night. You should tell me,
  indeed, that I am the very holiday lady of your dreams."</p>

  <p>"Of course," he grumbled lightly, "if you are going to steal all my
  favourite phrases and snatch the words from the lips of my favourite poets,
  you will have to be content with a dumb lover."</p>

  <p>"I should be content with you for my lover, dear Martin," she assured him,
  "however dumb you might be. The vital question is this. Is this forth-coming
  adventure to be a pilgrimage, a picnic, or an expedition?"</p>

  <p>"A pilgrimage," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, for this pilgrimage, shall I bring Leida? I have one evening
  frock, no jewellery, and nothing that I possess is beyond my own
  manipulation. My hair is a little troublesome sometimes after a long motor
  journey, but, with a very little amateur help, no doubt I can deal with
  it."</p>

  <p>"Rely, then," he begged, smiling, "upon the amateur help. I don't think
  that, unless you would be more comfortable with her, we need Leida."</p>

  <p>Pamela waved her hand in joyous dismissal. Leida was obviously
  disappointed.</p>

  <p>"If your maid will put your dressing-case in the dickey behind," he
  suggested, "you might perhaps like to sit with me. You see, I am not bringing
  a chauffeur myself."</p>

  <p>"I could tolerate the idea with great pleasure," she assented. "You are
  very pleasant to sit next to, Martin."</p>

  <p>"I don't talk much when I am driving," he reminded her.</p>

  <p>"The silence of the one man," she rejoined, "is much better than the
  conversation of all others. I shall sit here and watch those fine fingers of
  yours on the wheel and be happy. Why don't you wear gloves, Martin?"</p>

  <p>He thrust his hands into his pocket, drew out a pair of dark leather
  gloves and put them on.</p>

  <p>"I have a fancy that my touch on the wheel is surer with only the fingers
  there," he told her. "But I have no strong feelings about it."</p>

  <p>She laughed up at him.</p>

  <p>"A stray hand might perhaps be a little mischievous," she said. "Never
  mind. I promise to behave."</p>

  <p>They drove off, leaving Leida disconsolate on the pavement.</p>

  <p>"My dear, you are positively disgraceful in your innuendoes this morning,"
  Martin told her. "You have brought trouble upon your own head. As soon as we
  have reached the country lanes, I shall remove my left-hand glove&mdash;I
  shall not even apologize. But to tell you the truth, I drive much better with
  one hand."</p>

  <p>"We are going into the country, then?" she asked cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"Indeed we are," he assured her. "Shall I tell you where?"</p>

  <p>"No!" she cried. "You must not think of such a thing. I don't wish to
  know. I want to sit here and see the bricks and mortar fly past, and close my
  eyes and open them again presently and see hedges and trees all hurrying by
  me, and presently, perhaps, open fields&mdash;perhaps woods, it might even in
  time be the sea. I don't like slow transitions. I like to pass from one stage
  to another. That is why I think a soldier's death is such a fine thing.
  London is beautiful," she went on, leaning a little farther back in her seat,
  "but its curse are its suburbs. It's so long before you get anywhere. You
  have to watch the slow decline in the quality of the streets, and the shops,
  and the passers-by, and the architecture of the houses and everything else.
  Martin, I am so happy."</p>

  <p>They were in a broad road and he turned to smile at her. "Pamela," he told
  her, "you are splendid."</p>

  <p>"I would rather you called me that than anything," she confessed. "My
  father used to tell me that I had courage. I think I have internal courage,
  at any rate."</p>

  <p>"The greatest revolutions that tear the world to pieces are nothing,
  sometimes, but the tempests inside them," he reminded her.</p>

  <p>"With you I am always happy." She leaned her head against his shoulder and
  took his hand in hers. "As a harbinger of happiness you never lose your way,
  do you? Even on those Swiss mountain roads you always took me where the views
  were the most wonderful and the flowers the most perfect.... Am I chattering
  too much, Martin? I can't tell you why&mdash;there is quiet joy in my heart
  today. To be with you is such&mdash;it isn't really rest, because you are
  such a disturbing person, but you bring joy with you. I feel&mdash;I can't
  tell you why&mdash;the most flattering, the most amazing confidence of
  happiness when we are together. We are travelling on the road which has few
  sign-posts but one amazing goal. We are travelling towards happiness."</p>

  <p>They passed into the richer soil and colouring of the Western Counties.
  There had to be a pause to pick cowslips, another to strip a tiny spinney of
  its belated growth of bluebells, and yet another to cut a handful of deep
  yellow marigolds growing by a stream. This time she stepped once more lightly
  up into the road, passed through a gate and leaned once more over the stream
  for a moment, drew off her gloves, and cooled her fingers in the clear
  waters. Exactly overhead a lark was singing. She came back to the car,
  humming lightly a fragment of classical opera.</p>

  <p>"Martin," she invited, moving quite close to him, "please kiss me at once.
  This morning you are a neglectful lover and I am more than usually feeling
  the need for affection. How much farther do we go before lunch?"</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch and leaned back a little. The breeze was shaking
  the quaker grasses in the meadow by their side. He drew a long breath as he
  threw his hat down and drank in the flower-scented air.</p>

  <p>"There are wild roses somewhere quite near," she told him. "I wish that I
  could find them. There's no perfume in the world so sweet."</p>

  <p>They moved slowly on.</p>

  <p>"About luncheon," she persisted. "I am greedy."</p>

  <p>"The question of lunch presents serious problems," he confided, as they
  turned to face a most appalling hill. "There's an old-fashioned hotel about
  twenty miles farther on, but my housekeeper, who is always inclined to think
  you are about to starve if you take an excursion into the country, has packed
  a very simple basket."</p>

  <p>"How divine!" Pamela cried. "Where is the basket, Martin? Please let me
  look at it!"</p>

  <p>"You can just reach it, I think," he said. "It's in the hood there. Don't
  try to lift it out, though. When we get to the top of this hill we will pause
  and consider the situation."</p>

  <p>"I love old-fashioned hotels," Pamela confided, "but I love picnic baskets
  more."</p>

  <p>They glided easily to the top of the hill. Martin brought the car to a
  standstill in the shade of a grove of trees, and reached for the luncheon
  basket, which he placed on the seat between them for examination. Pamela
  didn't hesitate. She threw her hands up with joy.</p>

  <p>"The luncheon basket, if you please," she begged. "Why, chicken and ham,
  salad, hard-boiled eggs&mdash;beautiful brown ones, too&mdash;cheese and some
  fruit! What a spoilt man you must be, Martin!"</p>

  <p>"There is also this," he announced, drawing a familiar-looking thermos
  from its particular resting-place.</p>

  <p>"Terrible," she sighed. "I shall never want to go back to the simple life
  again."</p>

  <p>They drank cocktails, afterwards ate chicken and ham, and Pamela mixed the
  salad. There was a bottle of Pouilly '34, for which Martin borrowed a block
  or two of the ice from the cocktail shaker. They talked of past picnics; of
  Italy and Switzerland, where to eat out of doors was almost a religion; and
  they decided that wherever they took up their permanent abode&mdash;single or
  apart, as Pamela stipulated, with a spice of mischief in her eyes&mdash;they
  would lunch under no other roof than the ceiling of the sky. Then the basket
  was slowly repacked, they lit cigarettes and leaned back in their places.</p>

  <p>"In an hour's time," Martin confided, "we shall see the sea. Long before
  that, we shall smell it."</p>

  <p>"Wonderful," she murmured. "Will that be the end of our pilgrimage,
  Martin? Is this a little visit to the sea-side?"</p>

  <p>"No," he answered. "Very soon we shall come upon an old-fashioned house,
  we shall turn up the avenue, drive to the front door, and find that we are
  expected."</p>

  <p>"Your house?" she asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Not altogether," he replied. "A Brockenhurst has lived there for many
  generations. A Brockenhurst is living there now&mdash;my father. We are going
  to pay him a visit."</p>

  <p>"Martin, whatever will he think of my Viennese frock?" she exclaimed.
  "It's perfectly all right&mdash;it came from the right people and all
  that&mdash;but I am afraid it isn't the English idea of a picnic outfit
  altogether."</p>

  <p>"You need not bother about that, dear," he told her. "My father has been a
  great traveller and he is a person who understands most people and their ways
  of life. He is old-fashioned in a sense, but I am sure there is nothing you
  could do or say or wear of which he would not approve, because he is a person
  of great taste and he and I, we have this much affinity, we like the same
  people."</p>

  <p>"You dear," she smiled. "Tell me why we are going down to see him."</p>

  <p>"There is a very special reason, Pamela," he replied. "I think you will
  have guessed it before I have need to tell you&mdash;but you will see. If you
  have not guessed, I will tell you on the way back. You will understand."</p>

  <p>She clutched at his hand.</p>

  <p>"Martin," she begged, "am I being introduced as your fiancee?"</p>

  <p>"You certainly are," he told her. "Please let the rest of the situation
  develop itself."</p>

  <p>She leaned back, her eyes half closed.</p>

  <p>"I feel so ridiculously happy," she murmured. "There's one thing, Martin.
  You told me, almost the only time you mentioned your father, that he was a
  little old-fashioned. What will he think of our coming down like this?"</p>

  <p>"My dear," Martin told her, "he is one of those misguided individuals who,
  besides having a great affection for me, believes that I can do no
  wrong."</p>

  <p>"I see," she reflected quietly.</p>

  <p>"You will like him, I am sure," he went on, "and my father will most
  certainly like you. He has always had a great penchant, I must tell you, for
  Italian and French women. You can practise your gift for languages on him if
  you like. He speaks both perfectly."</p>

  <p>"Oh, let's start away," she begged. "I want to see him. What time are we
  expected?"</p>

  <p>"About four. My father has a very short siesta which will be over long
  before we get there, and, if I know anything of him, he will be strolling
  about in the grounds or the park, where he can get a view of the road,
  waiting for us."</p>

  <p>"We ought to start at once," she declared.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The moorlands, suggestive of flaming gorse and sweet-scented heather; more
  beautiful country; a field of hay-makers; the aromatic perfume everywhere of
  sun-baked grass; then a wood intersected with many well-kept drives cut
  through it; finally, a village with white stone and plaster and deep, cool,
  thatched roofs&mdash;a village with a quaint old manor-house standing back
  from the road; a church; cottages&mdash;then, two beautiful lodges where
  Martin slowed up.</p>

  <p>A woman held the gates open&mdash;a man, in game-keeper's clothes, stood
  by her side. Martin, having brought the car to a standstill, leaned out and
  shook hands with them both.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon, Crockham," he said. "Mrs. Crockham, you are looking
  younger than ever! How's his Lordship?"</p>

  <p>The man touched his hat respectfully.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful, sir," the man answered. "He insisted on walking round with me
  a few days ago to see how the young birds were coming on, and, I give you my
  word, sir, he walked like a young man."</p>

  <p>"Capital!" Martin announced. "This young lady, Mrs. Crockham, is a very
  great friend of mine. She has not seen much of English country life, so we
  shall be coming round to see you before so very long. We will come and have a
  look at the young birds ourselves at feeding-time. Meanwhile, I'm afraid we
  must be getting on."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Crockham's curtsy belonged to times gone by. Crockham removed his hat
  and stood a dumb, fine survival of feudal times. Martin restarted the car and
  they passed into a typical, undulating park, studded everywhere with oak and
  beech trees and ending in a stately avenue of elms. There were deer
  everywhere, lying under the trees and in the park's farthest corner. Pamela
  became very silent. When they passed through the final gates and entered the
  narrower avenue she leaned a little nearer to her companion.</p>

  <p>"Is this really your home, Martin?" she asked in almost an awed
  whisper.</p>

  <p>"This is Brockenhurst Park," he told her. "I hope that you will like it,
  Pamela. That is my father upon the steps."</p>

  <p>The mansion had come almost suddenly into view&mdash;a large,
  majestic-looking edifice only mellowed with time, with wonderful chimneys and
  windows, and half a dozen lawns with deep, velvety green turf dropping away
  down to the home woods. A little group of people was standing in the shadow
  of the great entrance. Martin slackened his speed as they turned into the
  last curve of the avenue.</p>

  <p>"You will recognize my father, I think, Pamela," Martin said. "He is in
  front, in the grey tweeds, leaning a little on his stick. That is Henderson,
  the butler, standing just behind, and Mrs. Henderson, the housekeeper, in the
  background there. I think you will like them all, Pamela. They are rather
  dear people. I never come to see them without wondering how I have the heart
  to stay away from them for so long."</p>

  <p>He waved his hand once more as they drew up before the steps. Martin's
  father&mdash;tall, dignified, white-haired, and with Martin's smile upon his
  lips&mdash;himself stretched out his hand and helped Pamela to alight.</p>

  <p>"Welcome to Brockenhurst, my dear!" he said pleasantly. "Pamela, isn't it?
  Well, you are very welcome. And Martin! It is good to see you here. My dear
  boy, how well you are looking! I shall begin to hope that this 'wanderlust'
  of yours is dwindling, and, if so, I shall be more than ever grateful to
  Pamela&mdash;I am right, my dear, am I not? It is 'Pamela'?"</p>

  <p>"It is indeed," she answered. "It makes me very proud that you should
  remember and call me by it. I think your house is the most beautiful thing I
  have ever seen."</p>

  <p>"That is good to hear," he declared, "because my son tells me that you,
  too, have been a great traveller. This is my dear friend and butler,
  Henderson, who has been with the family sixty years, and his wife who,
  although she looks quite a young woman still, has been with us very nearly as
  long. She would like to take you and show you your rooms, I am sure.
  Afterwards there will be tea in the Great Hall which we are opening in your
  honour."</p>

  <p>"You are very kind, Lord Brockenhurst," she murmured.</p>

  <p>Martin took his father's arm and they moved off across the hall. Even with
  Lord Brockenhurst's slight stoop, they were almost of the same height and the
  likeness between them was striking. There was a delighted smile upon the old
  man's lips.</p>

  <p>"My dear Martin," he said, "you have indeed given me a delightful
  surprise! I had no idea&mdash;you were over-modest in your
  description&mdash;that Pamela was so charming. Of Italian birth you told me?
  I could have sworn it."</p>

  <p>"An Orsini," Martin replied. "She is devoted to her art, though, and,
  unless there is some necessity for it, she never uses her title. She has not
  had a happy life, Father&mdash;I shall tell you all about it some
  day&mdash;but she is good, and I know that you will be fond of her."</p>

  <p>"Have no fear, Martin," his father begged. "For a simple gentleman who has
  lived so much on his own, I claim always that I have the one great gift of
  character divining. Besides, I trust you, too, Martin. You bring her to me,
  and I find her from the first moment a daughter whom I shall love."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p>It was after tea had been served that the hour of Pamela's ordeal arrived.
  Lord Brockenhurst, at whose right hand Pamela had sat, and who had succeeded
  without the slightest difficulty in keeping her entirely at her ease, opened
  the proceedings quite graciously.</p>

  <p>"I think, my dear," he suggested, "it might be of special interest to you
  to become personally acquainted with the lives and doings of some of the more
  illustrious members of the family which is hoping some day, and before very
  long, to welcome you into their midst."</p>

  <p>It was rather a formal speech, but it was spoken with so much gentle
  restraint and without the slightest touch of more than honourable pride, that
  Pamela answered almost eagerly.</p>

  <p>"The picture gallery, Lord Brockenhurst! I should love to see it!"</p>

  <p>Lord Brockenhurst touched the bell at his side and gave a few brief
  orders. First Henderson arrived with a long white wand, shaped like a fishing
  rod, which could be lengthened or shortened at will. The secretary of the
  household followed, a studious-looking youth, Maurice Brockenhurst, not long
  down from Oxford. Martin, his father, and Pamela completed the little party,
  and as they stepped on to the shining floor, Lord Brockenhurst presented
  Pamela with an exquisitely carved white ivory stick, rubber-shod, and with a
  beautifully fashioned head.</p>

  <p>"You may find our expedition a little tiring," he said. "My dear wife and
  my grandmother used both in their turn to carry it when they went round to
  call upon their ancestors. We don't often," he added, with his quiet smile,
  "make a formal occasion of this. We have many sightseers who come to see the
  pictures&mdash;our few Romneys, for instance, are famous, and our Reynolds
  you have, of course, heard about&mdash;but we have certain days set apart for
  showing those. This is a more intimate and, to us, a more pleasant
  occasion."</p>

  <p>"I feel very honoured," Pamela assured him sweetly. "It will give me very
  much pleasure."</p>

  <p>"You, with your knowledge of Art and the great painters of the
  Renaissance, will, I think, find a special interest in our family collection,
  Pamela," he said kindly. "I am getting an old man and it is a tour which I do
  not often make, but I am coming myself, as you see, and I shall introduce you
  myself to one or two of the Brockenhursts of the past. For instance, over
  that farther door which leads into the banqueting-hall is Geoffrey
  Brockenhurst, who departed to the Holy War with a troop of over one hundred
  of the men of Brockenhurst, was killed there, and had his remains blessed by
  the Pope before they were brought home. The painter was an
  Italian&mdash;Ferrari&mdash;of whom very little is known. But Maurice, my
  nephew there, will tell you all there is to be told about him whenever you
  have a little time to spare. A modern Italian has written of his career and
  other work."</p>

  <p>"Am I dreaming?" Pamela exclaimed. "Of course I am not&mdash;the likeness
  is there. Why, Lord Brockenhurst, both you and Martin have it!"</p>

  <p>Her host patted her on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"It is wonderful that you, a stranger," he said, "should have recognized
  this. But it has been written about a great deal. For years after Geoffrey
  Brockenhurst's time our family seems to have turned out nothing but soldiers.
  During the Wars of the Roses they won great honours fighting on the side of
  the Lancastrians, and you see a representative of them there just in front of
  us. He is curiously chronicled as Robert Stephen Knight of Brockenhurst and
  Duke of Merioneth. If you are sufficiently interested, my dear
  child&mdash;and I have a fancy that you will be&mdash;Maurice will read to
  you from our Great Book, which we look upon as being second only to the
  Domesday Book, accounts of some of these lesser Brockenhursts who have still
  played their part in the great happenings which have befallen our country.
  The Clarence Brockenhurst in the scarlet robes was Lord Chief Justice at the
  time of King John, and the Brockenhurst, whom you see on horse-back to his
  right, commanded an army which fought desperately on the Royalist side in the
  Battle of Naseby. There are very few of our women, as you may notice, whose
  pictures have survived, but there is one amazing one there of Helena, Duchess
  of Brittany, painted by Andrea del Sarto on that ill-fated visit of his to
  the Court of the great French king."</p>

  <p>"Tell me," Pamela begged, "who is the man with Martin's lips and your high
  forehead? He looks almost as though he could step out of his frame and greet
  you both, his kinsmen. In the old days they seemed to ignore in important
  paintings any eccentricities or distinction in feature, but this one&mdash;he
  must have been painted from the heart. It is life itself."</p>

  <p>"Pamela, dear child," her host assured her, "you make me very happy when
  you speak with such understanding of my treasures. That was Philippe Martin,
  Count of St. Aumade, Earl of Brockenhurst and, as has been lately proved,
  fourteenth Baronet. He was the bosom friend of the first Napoleon. That
  portrait was finished on the eve of the Battle of Trafalgar."</p>

  <p>Lord Brockenhurst was leaning a little heavily on his stick. He had taken
  Martin's right arm.</p>

  <p>"I am being warned," the former said with a smile. "It is always one of my
  great days when I wander into this gallery, Pamela, and great days are
  fatiguing when one approaches my age. The remaining pictures you see
  there&mdash;one is a Romney&mdash;then there's a de Laszlo and a Sargent, of
  more modern days, and finally three Lawrences, which you must see. Meanwhile,
  bear with an old man's humours and come and sit with me at the window in my
  room."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The little party broke up. Martin remained with the secretary and
  presently started off for the steward's offices. Pamela walked by Lord
  Brockenhurst's side into a smaller apartment which he called his den. It was
  a stately-looking, octagonally-shaped annex of the library. The walls were
  lined with books and the long windows opened out on a terrace. Brockenhurst
  subsided into his favourite easy-chair, drawn up to the window, and then
  busied himself seeing that Pamela was comfortably ensconced by his side.
  Stretching away before her was a marvellous vale of fruitful
  country&mdash;pastures and woodland, stretching to the blue horizon, with
  nothing more disturbing to break their outline than the quiet hamlets on the
  estate and a few larger villages.</p>

  <p>"And now, my dear child," he said, "when Mrs. Henderson has shown you over
  the house&mdash;we have some beautiful tapestries which I know you will
  like&mdash;you will have a fair idea then of what Brockenhurst is like."</p>

  <p>"It is far more beautiful than I had imagined," Pamela said with gentle
  enthusiasm. "Nothing that Martin has ever said to me about it seems
  adequate."</p>

  <p>"I am glad you find it beautiful," was the quietly tremulous reply. "To me
  it has become, during my later years, a sort of heaven upon earth. I am
  hoping that someday you and Martin may look upon it like that and&mdash;if I
  may suggest such a thing&mdash;also your children."</p>

  <p>"Will you be glad for me to marry Martin?" she asked, moved. "I love him
  so much."</p>

  <p>"My dear," he assured her, with a deep earnestness in his haunting voice,
  "you are just the sort of woman I have always felt that I would love to have
  him marry. Every Brockenhurst has had in his blood a spirit of adventure.
  That is why the men of our race have travelled so far and have fought in so
  many different countries. What I am proud of&mdash;more proud than I can tell
  you, perhaps&mdash;is that no Brockenhurst has ever brought dishonour upon
  his name. Soldiers and sailors, lawyers, law-makers and renowned politicians,
  have taken their place as great landowners of a splendid country. There has
  never been a tarnished shield. No Brockenhurst has ever been guilty of a
  dishonourable action. They have lived their lives in the sight of God and of
  man as honourable human beings should. They have fought for their country,
  toiled for their country, and, when their time has come, they have gone
  honourably to their place amongst the immortals. They have enjoyed the
  possession of a great estate and the bearing of a famous name, and they have
  proved themselves worthy of it. My dear child, I don't suppose you can quite
  realize what it means to a man of my age, but this is the crucial point. I am
  the last of the Brockenhursts in the direct line&mdash;and Martin is my only
  son. If anything should happen to me or if he should make the great mistake
  which has brought so many of our great families down to the dust, a famous
  family would pass into oblivion. I love my people as I love my God, and I
  want to die as happily and as confidently as I have lived. Martin has lived a
  strange life. He tried the Army and he wearied of it. He then had the
  peculiar idea of becoming one of the civil protectors of his country&mdash;he
  actually joined the Police Force! He wearied of that. Since then he seems to
  me to have become a little restless. He has gifts, you know,
  Pamela&mdash;great gifts. He is an artist, he has travelled, and travelled
  intelligently. If by chance he had taken up diplomacy, he might have won a
  fine position. There would have been nothing to have prevented his becoming
  one of our leading diplomats. Well, his tastes did not lead him that way. I
  have been something of a philosopher all my life. I have never
  worried&mdash;I have preferred to see events flow on their natural
  course&mdash;but the one fear I have always had at the back of my mind was,
  not that Martin would ever commit a dishonourable action, that he would ever
  do anything to bring disgrace upon our name, but that he would not fully
  understand how, for the sake of the next generation, he must take his place
  amongst those great men who have gone before us. His choice of a wife has
  been my great anxiety. He has chosen you. Pamela, I am very pleased. I am
  very happy&mdash;he has chosen you and I am pleased with his choice."</p>

  <p>She put her hand in his&mdash;if only she could have stopped the
  fluttering of her heart!</p>

  <p>"Lord Brockenhurst," she said, "you&mdash;you flatter me. I love Martin. I
  would do all I could and, if this great thing comes to pass, I will do all I
  can to point out to him what I think your will would have been."</p>

  <p>Lord Brockenhurst smiled.</p>

  <p>"I do not think now," he said happily, "that he will need it. The only
  fear I have ever had is that he might not have thought sufficiently of the
  next generation. Somehow, with you, I have no fear. You, yourself, come of a
  great family historically, Pamela. Don't think that I am flattering you, but
  the very sight of you pleases me. There is a clearness in your eyes which
  gives me joy. You have the sweet, loving mouth of a woman, but also of a just
  woman. You have the forehead which means wisdom. And I&mdash;far out from the
  world though I may seem&mdash;I know something of your art, Pamela. I was
  trundled out one morning from Brown's Hotel to a little show given at a small
  gallery by Simon Lebur, and I saw your pictures. When I knew who it was my
  son was bringing to see me, I was glad. Let me tell you why, Pamela. No one
  could have conceived and painted those pictures who had not a soul. No one
  can live finely and honourably without a sense of beauty. These things I
  thought in my mind when I looked at your work, and, as I said just now, when
  Martin told me that he was bringing you down to see me&mdash;for a purpose
  which I could not help divining&mdash;and I thought of the things I already
  knew about you, I was glad."</p>

  <p>She rested her hand upon his. Her fingers caressed his.</p>

  <p>"What I can do to make you happy, dear Father," she said, with a little
  break in her voice, "I will do always. Don't be afraid&mdash;I shall not fail
  you."</p>

  <p>"I know that you will not," he said smiling. "I have no fear&mdash;I am
  quite happy. It's a great thing to be able to say, but I can say it honestly
  and truthfully. I am happy, Pamela, in having found you for my daughter."</p>

  <p>There was something indescribably sweet to her in the smile, the little
  pressure of his fingers, and the half-closing of his fine, clear eyes.</p>

  <p>"An old man likes to keep his weaknesses to himself," he murmured. "You
  will forgive me if I do what I have done for many years at this hour of the
  day&mdash;if I sleep lightly for a little time?"</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"Can I do anything to make you more comfortable?" she asked, bending over
  him.</p>

  <p>He shook his head. Already it seemed to her that he was asleep. She kissed
  him lightly upon the temples and sped away. It was not until Martin arrived a
  few moments later that either of them divined the truth. It was not for his
  afternoon's sleep alone that Lord Brockenhurst had closed his eyes&mdash;it
  was his happy passing into Eternity.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p>Once more&mdash;only this time it was some weeks later&mdash;in the full
  summer with its splendid sunshine and its glowing heat, surrounded by the
  promise of a harvest rich and plentiful, Pamela unpacked a picnic basket,
  very nearly at the same spot on the borders of the Great West Road. This
  time, however, the basket had been carefully packed with her own fingers by
  Mrs. Henderson, the housekeeper of Brockenhurst Park. There was a great deal
  more elaboration in this repast. The fine, heavy Brockenhurst silver had been
  freely used. The tumblers and wine-glasses, zealously protected, were of the
  finest glass. The chickens had been selected by the chef himself and the
  wines had been decanted and poured into carafes of Venetian form and beauty.
  The salads came from the famous Brockenhurst walled gardens and the chef
  himself had mixed the dressing. For the first time for many days Pamela
  laughed almost gaily as she handed Martin his damask napkin and a basket of
  green figs and peaches, resting on their own dark, cool leaves.</p>

  <p>"Is this what you will have to live up to all your days, my dear?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"If I do, you will," he answered briskly.</p>

  <p>Perhaps at that moment they both of them realized that it was the first
  time they had approached a great subject. There was a brief silence. Martin
  shook the cocktails. Pamela, with the wooden spoon and fork, stirred round
  the contents of the salad bowl. Apparently, they both came to the decision
  that the moment was inopportune for serious talk. True, the larks had ceased
  to sing. There was a touch of relief in the heat, in the burning sunshine and
  the warm grip of summer which had succeeded the soft joy of the late spring.
  The seasons had marched on, the urge for serious conversation faded. Yet
  Pamela, who was a person of infinite tact, made no effort whatever to avoid
  the serious thoughts that sometimes obtruded themselves upon their intimate
  talk. Never, since the day of the funeral, which seemed to have brought half
  the County into the small churchyard, had they shrunk from speaking of the
  wonderful passing of Martin's father.</p>

  <p>"Just where we are sitting now," Pamela said quietly, as she raised her
  glass and drank half of its contents, "just where we are sitting now, Martin,
  on our way down I was wondering how I should like your father and how he
  would like me, which then seemed so much more important."</p>

  <p>"Never in the whole course of my life," Martin declared, "have I seen such
  an absolute and complete capitulation as his. You knew it, of course; you
  must have felt it. He loved you from the first moment you arrived and he gave
  you his hand to help you out of the car. It was a moment of great joy to me,
  Pamela. I don't think that I have ever been happier than when I saw the light
  in his eyes as he bent over towards your fingers. He said so little to me,
  too&mdash;even afterwards. He knew that every little action of his, every
  little turn of the head, every little cadence of his voice was telling me
  what I wanted to know."</p>

  <p>"It is so wonderful to think of," she whispered quietly.</p>

  <p>"Every thought one has of that day, Pamela, is like an inspiration to me.
  Not any part of that time will ever pass from my thoughts. It is the
  inspiration which will drive us both on to what must and shall happen."</p>

  <p>"Dear, confident man," she murmured, patting his hand. "I love you in your
  overbearing moods. You seem to have caught a touch of that old ancestor of
  yours of whose face one saw so little, whose bearing, the splendid carriage
  of whose head even, made one feel that he was riding to the Saracens in a
  holy cause and with the overpowering will born in his blood. Martin, are you
  never afraid that you will be disappointed?"</p>

  <p>He leaned over and kissed her. It was a joy which he felt day by day, but
  never for one second had there been any false pretences between them. She
  wiped her lips and demanded more, and the little laugh with which he yielded
  to her was a perfectly natural and joyous impulse.</p>

  <p>"Pamela, my dear, I have no fear," he assured her. "The world was given us
  to conquer, not that we should submit to it."</p>

  <p>"Hear how proudly he talks!" she laughed. "Martin Spencer Campbell,
  Eleventh Viscount Brockenhurst! So you will govern the world&mdash;you will
  bend its laws?"</p>

  <p>"I will do all those things," he replied, "so long as I win the prize
  which in the spirit is always mine."</p>

  <p>They ate and drank and smoked. Then they changed their places a little
  whilst Janien, who had followed them in a small shooting-brake, came and
  packed up. Late in the afternoon they drove slowly into London.</p>

  <p>"You will come up to my studio with me, please?" Pamela begged, when they
  reached her block of flats. "Leida will be there, I know, but I shall not be
  happy unless you come with me."</p>

  <p>"I must," he interrupted her, lightly but firmly. "We have spoken of this
  before, dear. Everything shall be done as we have planned."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Together Pamela and Martin stood for a few minutes, looking curiously
  round the large room. Pamela silently lifted the sheet which concealed the
  picture she had been painting. She looked at it for a moment, sighed, and
  replaced its covering. Then she turned round and followed Martin to the
  communicating door where he was waiting for her. They passed into her flat
  and from room to room they made their way, searching, examining, suspicious
  of every possible place of hiding. With every movement her step grew
  lighter.</p>

  <p>"Martin," she told him, as she clung to his arm, "I have no more
  hysterical fears. They are all gone. I don't believe for a moment that he
  would do me any harm, even if he were here. He has had the money he asked
  for. Apparently, he has succeeded in making it answer his purpose. We shall
  hear nothing more about Richard Lebur."</p>

  <p>"I am not so content with that as you are, my dear," he said.</p>

  <p>She smiled. There was not a sign of any possible dispute or disagreement
  in her face. More than ever in that quiet glance at her, in his appreciation
  of her slow, almost eager smile, he realized how completely she had given
  herself into his keeping. He had only to speak and she was his. But she was
  as sure as of her own existence that he would speak only when the time came.
  The time was, perhaps, impossible. He would make it possible.</p>

  <p>"You will sleep tonight?" he asked, as they completed their search of her
  rooms.</p>

  <p>"Marvellously, dear Martin," she declared. "Don't think that I haven't
  appreciated the splendour of Brockenhurst&mdash;I revelled in it. I was as
  happy there as a woman could be. Somehow or other it seems to have exorcised
  fear from my heart. I am back here where once I prayed for death, because
  fear was so horrible a thing, and I am back here with a heart as light as
  when I tripped up the steps for the first time in my life, aching to commence
  work. The ugly patch has gone, Martin&mdash;gone for ever. Soon I shall go
  round and see Simon. You know why?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I shall stay and go with you, I think," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"It is not fear that will take me," she assured him. "It is a joy. I asked
  him once, when I was a little afraid, about your father, Martin, and he
  answered me very simply but as a man as intense as he is might be, when
  speaking to his God. He simply said, 'Lord Brockenhurst&mdash;he is the
  greatest gentleman God ever made.' Really, that was one of the reasons, and
  because he was your father, that I had no fear. Have some tea, Martin? You
  told me you always loved it after motoring. Then, if you like, we will both
  drive round and see Simon."</p>

  <p>"Delightful!" he agreed.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>They found Simon Lebur poring over a wonderful book of Florentine prints,
  with that marvellous date of 1477 printed in Gothic characters on the
  title-page. He rose a little tremulously to his feet, but they pushed him
  back again.</p>

  <p>"I am very honoured," he acknowledged. "This is a great joy to me,
  although it is a great sorrow to have to say those few words to you, Lord
  Brockenhurst."</p>

  <p>"Don't say them, Simon," Martin begged, arranging his cushions a little
  more carefully. "I know how you feel, and I think there was never a man for
  whom the whole world felt so acutely what we all feel. He was a great
  gentleman, Simon, and I am as proud to think of his death as I was proud of
  his living. He had met Pamela and he was happy. He knew that some way or
  other, somehow, we were coming together and the Brockenhursts would go on. He
  died with that happiness in his face," he murmured. "Don't think that
  anything could spoil it."</p>

  <p>Simon Lebur hid his face for a moment or two. They seated themselves, one
  on either side of him. Martin took up the book of prints with which he was
  fascinated. He put it down as soon as Simon raised himself from the little
  seat.</p>

  <p>"My old friend," Martin said, "Pamela and I have made a decision. We have
  kept to it wonderfully and it has made things very, very easy. We talk of
  important things without a single shiver. Tell us, is there any news of your
  son?"</p>

  <p>"It is strange," Simon confided, "but there is very little news. Inspector
  Charlesworth has been down here and talked with me. Apparently, he too knows
  nothing, but&mdash;I tell you because I was not altogether satisfied&mdash;I
  think he knows more than he was willing to tell even me, the man's own
  father."</p>

  <p>"I have read the papers every day," Martin reflected.</p>

  <p>"He is still free?" was the quiet answer.</p>

  <p>"The newspapers could not keep it out of their columns if he had been
  arrested. He is still free. They say that he has gone abroad, but no one
  knows&mdash;no one knows."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Presently they drove back to Pamela's home. She paused before
  descending.</p>

  <p>"At what time does my lord and master propose to dine?" she asked. "And
  where?"</p>

  <p>"I will be candid," he replied. "I should like to dine&mdash;if it doesn't
  interfere with the free movements of your cook&mdash;<i>chez vous</i>. That
  long drive through the beautiful country has put me out of humour with
  restaurants. Tomorrow night we might have a picnic at my rooms and the next
  again, I think, somewhere in the country."</p>

  <p>"They will love it at my place," Pamela declared. "They really have not
  enough to do. What time will you be round?"</p>

  <p>"At a quarter to eight."</p>

  <p>"What a convenient man you are," she sighed. "That was just the time I was
  going to suggest. I have a fancy for an hour's work. It is just the right
  light, or rather, it will be in half an hour's time."</p>

  <p>They blew kisses to one another and parted. Ten minutes later Martin was
  shaking hands with Charlesworth in the latter's grim, bare apartment.</p>

  <p>"Terribly sorry about your father," Charlesworth said, with that faint
  note of respect and sympathy in his tone which an Englishman finds it hard to
  avoid when he alludes to the passing of a peer. "I never had the honour of
  meeting him, but he seems to have been tremendously popular."</p>

  <p>"In his younger days," Martin admitted, "my father was a well-known figure
  in a good many capitals, especially those where pictures are. It was a great
  blow, of course, Charlesworth, and thank you very much. But he died exactly
  as he would have wished to die&mdash;completely happy and completely
  resigned. You can guess what I am after, of course?"</p>

  <p>"I can guess," the Inspector admitted. "I don't quite know whether you
  will consider my news good or bad, but, such as it is, you may as well know
  the truth. Lebur seems as though at last he had really brought off a clean
  escape from Dartmoor. Once or twice my men&mdash;if they are telling the
  truth&mdash;have been within an ace of a capture, and there was another time,
  as you know, when I could have taken him myself, although, for heaven's sake,
  don't let the Governor of Dartmoor know that. He seems to have vanished off
  the map, and this," the Inspector continued, after a cautious glance round
  the room, "notwithstanding the fact that that woman was only aching for a
  chance to give him away."</p>

  <p>There was a little twinge, almost of pain, in Martin's face.</p>

  <p>"Tell me how you know that," he asked.</p>

  <p>The Inspector shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"She rang up from a call-box," he confided. "Insisted on speaking to me.
  Well, I went to the instrument and asked who it was. I didn't recognize her
  voice, but there was no doubt that she was deadly frightened. 'I am the
  Inspector you are asking for,' I said. 'What do you want with me?'</p>

  <p>"'Do you still want that Dartmoor escaped criminal they are looking for?'
  she asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"'Of course I do,' I replied. 'It is our business to want him.'</p>

  <p>"'Is there any reward for his capture?' she asked.</p>

  <p>"'About the usual,' I told her. 'Two hundred pounds or something of that
  sort.'</p>

  <p>"'It isn't much,' she said, discontentedly.</p>

  <p>"I knew who she was then&mdash;hateful beast of a woman.</p>

  <p>"'If you send a man across Albert Bridge and tell him to take the first
  gate on the left into the Park, you will find him sitting on the seventh
  seat, reading a newspaper. He is to wait there for me. I want someone to come
  there for him in an hour's time. You had better hurry things up, though. He
  gets very nervous sometimes.'</p>

  <p>"'Someone shall be there,' I promised, 'before that time.'</p>

  <p>"'And what about the reward?' she asked.</p>

  <p>"'You can ring me up tomorrow morning for an appointment,' I told her.</p>

  <p>"'I think,' she grumbled, 'the reward ought to be more. He would kill me
  if he knew.'</p>

  <p>"'Well, he won't know,' I assured her."</p>

  <p>"What did you do?" Martin asked.</p>

  <p>"I took a taxi down there," the Inspector confided. "Got out at the gate
  and there he was on the seventh seat, reading the <i>Daily Mail</i>. I
  recognized him quite well from where I was, though. I didn't go any nearer. I
  had half a mind to give the lady away. It would have served her right, but I
  could not have faced what would certainly have happened afterwards. I got
  back into my taxi and came back to work. I have been in Battersea Park half a
  dozen times since and I have had those flats opposite searched just in case
  we could come across him."</p>

  <p>"What would you do if you did come across him, Inspector?" Martin asked
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"Well, I will tell you," the former replied. "Why do you think he changed
  his plea? Why do you think he is still in hiding? Why do you think he doesn't
  get away somewhere where it is safer? I will tell you what I think is the
  explanation of all these things. I think he is shielding someone
  else&mdash;that beast of a woman, most likely. I think he knows all right who
  killed David Culpepper, but he is keeping it to himself. Use a little common
  sense, my friend. If it isn't the woman he's shielding, who would it be?"</p>

  <p>Martin opened his mouth and closed it again.</p>

  <p>"Even if I knew, that is the one secret in my life I should feel like
  keeping even from you," he said.</p>

  <p>"More fool you," the Inspector told him.</p>

  <p>Martin rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Aren't we all fools, Inspector, in one or two things?"</p>

  <p>"Even a peer of the realm?" the Inspector asked with mild sarcasm.</p>

  <p>Martin picked up his stick and hat.</p>

  <p>"Even a peer of the realm, my friend," he assented. "All the same, even a
  fool, though, can sometimes give good advice."</p>

  <p>"Well, what is it?" the Inspector demanded.</p>

  <p>Martin hesitated for a moment. Then he spoke.</p>

  <p>"If I were in your position, Charlesworth," he said, "I should feel it my
  duty to find out what has become of Mrs. David Culpepper."</p>

  <p>"You think he has made away with her?"</p>

  <p>But Martin was already half-way down the stairs.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p>Martin was feeling very happy when, having parked his car carefully and
  disposed of his hat on a hall chair, he presented himself in Pamela's little
  dining-room a few minutes before dinner-time.</p>

  <p>"Good news?" she exclaimed, smiling at him from her task at the sideboard.
  "How pleased you look with yourself, Martin! Has everything been going
  well?"</p>

  <p>"Quite well," he answered. "But I didn't know that I was showing it to
  that extent. I don't know that there is anything to send either of us into
  the seventh heaven of delight. I have seen Charlesworth. The
  woman&mdash;well, I always told you she was a cursed creature, only I left
  out the definition of her which the world in which she was brought up would
  have chosen. She tried to give him away and earn two hundred pounds."</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry," Pamela said sadly.</p>

  <p>"He found her out, it seems. They must have spent some time together. She
  must have felt the <i>ennui</i> coming on, or he hadn't enough money, or she
  wanted to break loose. One of the three&mdash;I don't know which&mdash;but
  she did just what a creature of that order would do. She went to a telephone
  kiosk, rang up the Inspector and asked whether there was any reward for the
  apprehension of the Dartmoor convict, Lebur. He fenced with it, but had to
  tell her the truth&mdash;it would probably be worth two hundred pounds to
  her. She told him where he would be at a certain time and rang off. He went
  there. True enough, the man was sitting on the seat she had indicated in
  Battersea Park. The Inspector had a glance at him and came away."</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"It was Inspector Charlesworth, the man who shares my rather curious
  belief in your husband's innocence," he replied. "Anyhow, he had a peep at
  him and returned to Scotland Yard. When she rang up in the morning to make an
  appointment&mdash;hoping, I suppose, for the two hundred pounds&mdash;he
  lied. He said that he had passed the spot but there was no one there. He also
  gave the lady to understand that he wished to have nothing more to do with
  the affair. So that was that!"</p>

  <p>Pamela was quite silent for several moments. In fact, she waited until she
  had squeezed the juice of three lemons into a proper receptacle, emptied it
  into a cocktail shaker, and added the requisite amount of ice, gin, and
  Cointreau before she spoke. Then, after indulging in a little vigorous
  shaking and pouring out the contents from the shaker, she asked Martin a
  question.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Martin, why have you always been so certain that my husband was
  innocent?"</p>

  <p>"Well," he admitted, after a moment's thought, "that is a very reasonable
  thing to ask, darling, and I wonder you have not asked me before. I just am
  sure, but it is very hard for me to tell you why. You know my whole history.
  You know what my amiable profession was&mdash;that I was the police constable
  who was boosted into this case through the accident of his beat. You know
  that I was at the inquest. You know that I was at the trial. I was there
  during the few minutes when Sir Frederick Leversen had that short, but very
  agitated, conversation with him while he was still in the dock, and I was
  also in court when Leversen appealed to the Judge for permission for his
  client to alter his plea. His barrister was just as surprised as the rest of
  the court, the Judge, and I were, but the thing was done. The Judge did not
  hesitate, but granted the plea. I was in court when Lebur staggered away and
  was taken down to his cell. I was there when he was brought up and sentenced
  to penal servitude for life. I was there when he swung round and cried out,
  so that every person in court could hear him&mdash;'It's a lie I have told. I
  did not murder Culpepper&mdash;I am not guilty!' He was waved away. The legal
  part of the assembly seemed a little shocked, but the thing was over. His
  revised plea had been accepted. He had pleaded 'Guilty' and he was sentenced
  to penal servitude for life."</p>

  <p>"I am not sure, Martin," she declared, "that you have not mistaken your
  profession. I love the rise and fall of your voice sometimes when you are
  talking to me, sometimes when you are whispering to me, often when there is
  no one in the world there to whom it can make any difference, and I adore it
  when you are reading poetry. When you use your voice as you did just then, I
  find it curiously and thrillingly dramatic. As a barrister or an actor,
  Martin, you would have been a very famous man."</p>

  <p>"I am a famous man now," he declared. "I am the future husband of the
  Princess Pamela Orsini."</p>

  <p>She permitted herself a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"The world would not admit it," she declared, "and I should hate to hear
  you described as Pamela Orsini's husband."</p>

  <p>He finished his cocktail and set down the glass. Pamela's perfect
  parlourmaid was waiting to serve the soup. He took his place opposite his
  hostess.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I should still be a proud man," he declared.</p>

  <p>"And the meaning of all this is?"</p>

  <p>"What shall we call it? An inspiration! I carried away from the court with
  me that day&mdash;an inspiration. I sent in my resignation to Scotland Yard
  on an inspiration. I felt that things went on in law which would pain the
  ordinary human being. I didn't believe at that moment that your husband was
  guilty. I have never believed it."</p>

  <p>"It is awfully hard lines on him if your inspiration is a true one,
  Martin," she said, glancing at the empty space behind her chair which Leida
  had temporarily quitted.</p>

  <p>"Not so much so as it would seem, Pamela," he declared. "Supposing your
  husband was not guilty, then if we wished to do so, we might, with that fact
  in our minds, study his career from the time he married you. What was he
  worth as a man? Nothing, less than nothing. Fate repays always, you know. If
  he was not guilty of that crime for which he was sentenced, he was guilty of
  a greater one because he took a sweet and marvellously sensitive woman like
  you and, save for her own strength, save for her own friends, save for her
  own dignity of spirit, he would have broken her heart and poisoned her soul.
  Therefore, as you see, it has never given me a sleepless night to believe
  that he was found guilty of a crime which he never committed. He committed
  another for which he deserved even worse punishment. My sense of justice is
  troubled, but not to any amazing extent. He was innocent of one crime, but he
  was guilty of another. Not much odds all the same, you can see. If I could
  set him at liberty, I would. You, out of a woman's pity, were willing to do
  what you could for him. I, from my masculine sense of justice and my queer
  inspiration, have also tried to do what I could for him. Between us, we
  certainly have done great things. I am not content even now to let it alone.
  What more can be done shall be done. Do you think I don't appreciate that one
  fine deed of his when he sent me those papers, Pamela? Let there be no words
  between us as regards that. I decided, as you have decided. I am happy in the
  feeling that nothing but a strange and wonderful scruple, which has its basis
  in one of the finest impulses a woman can feel, is keeping us apart. I pass
  on from that, but if you think I have given up for ever the hope I once
  conceived, that my father died believing, that our union was soon to be
  perfectly consummated, you are very wrong, dear. I live for that and I don't
  admit the possibility of failure. I am not going to kill your husband to get
  my way. It will come. Meanwhile, I claim that we are the two most sensible,
  charmingly conducted, reasonable human beings alive upon this earth. Leida is
  coming in at the door, dear, and I should like&mdash;well, let us say,
  another potato."</p>

  <p>"It is perfectly true," she laughed across the table at him. "Leida," she
  said, "serve the potatoes, if you please, to Monsieur."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>After dinner there were portents of a thunderstorm, but in the meantime
  the air was heavy with threats and the heat was intense. They drove through
  the parks and up to Hampstead Heath, where they faced with joy the cool winds
  that blew in their faces. All the time the clouds were gathering.</p>

  <p>"So we are back in London, dear Pamela," he said, as they looked down on
  the slowly arriving lights, pin-pricks of fire, in their quiet places.</p>

  <p>"We are back in London, Martin, my sweet," she whispered, slipping off her
  glove and holding his hand fondly. "Only it is a different London, don't you
  know. I hope you, too, feel that the world is such a different place when one
  really loves anybody. The air you breathe is different, the streets you walk,
  the shops into whose windows you look, the faces of strangers in the
  streets&mdash;it is all so different. I feel it all the time. A picture comes
  to me with its inner meaning more fully revealed, a chord of music comes
  quivering into existence from some more distant place in the well of melody.
  I played some trifle of Debussy's while I was waiting for you and I swear
  that I felt something in the music of those chords which I have never felt
  before. Life is different. I hope you will feel that soon, too, Martin. It
  will be such a bond between us. It will help so much&mdash;and,
  listen&mdash;I have not your splendid courage, I have not that fine patience
  of yours, but I believe, too, and I believe what you say. It will come if we
  just go on waiting. It will come, and I feel drawn nearer to the spiritual
  world because I have had the joy of finding another person besides myself who
  is fine enough to want to wait with me until the time comes. I think it will
  be very wonderful."</p>

  <p>The first spot of the storm came. He touched his starter and they glided
  off down the hill, towards the city, where the lights, from being pin-pricks,
  had become almost a blaze. He pulled up outside her home before the real
  bursting of the storm.</p>

  <p>"You will come in, please," she begged. "A thunderstorm together&mdash;all
  these elements in life are different now, and more wonderful."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

  <p>Diana was a very talkative young woman, with expensive ways and habits,
  but she knew very well when to be silent. She slipped off her stool, on an
  evening not long afterwards, when Martin came into the Club, and grasped his
  hands feelingly.</p>

  <p>"How nice of you to come, Martin!" she exclaimed. "We were all so sorry.
  Dad was terribly cut up about it."</p>

  <p>"You are very kind indeed," he said. "It is difficult for me to remember
  whether I wrote all the personal letters I ought to have done, but you
  received yours, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I did," she answered. "It was just like you&mdash;very simple,
  very short, and very pertinent. Had you any idea that he was really so
  ill?"</p>

  <p>"Frankly, I had," he confessed. "I had a private letter from the doctor.
  That is why I decided to go down and see him when I did."</p>

  <p>"And you arrived just in time?"</p>

  <p>Martin nodded.</p>

  <p>"And only just," he answered. "It was all very beautiful down there,
  Diana. It is a beautiful part of the world in which to live&mdash;it is a
  beautiful part of the world, too, in which to die."</p>

  <p>"Have you opened up the mansion again?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I shall never do that unless and until I marry," he answered. "It is just
  a little overpowering in its size as well as its beauty."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you marry, Martin?" she asked. "Everyone was wondering, when
  you reappeared&mdash;it seems such a short time ago. I don't think they have
  quite left off yet."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you tell them?" he smiled.</p>

  <p>She boxed his ears lightly.</p>

  <p>"They wouldn't believe me," she declared. "I don't suppose there is any
  girl of my age, especially with my past, dear Martin, who wouldn't jump at
  the idea of marrying you with Brockenhurst Court in Devonshire, a house in
  town, and, I suppose, still your French estates."</p>

  <p>"You seem very glib about my possessions," he observed. "Perhaps you have
  answered your own question. I am waiting to find someone who loves me for
  myself alone."</p>

  <p>"There are plenty," she sighed, "who would do that&mdash;plenty, who only
  want a word of encouragement. You are a modest man, Martin, not to say shy.
  Why did you come here tonight? Did you come out of some freakish whim, or
  because you were hungry or thirsty, or did you perhaps come to see me? I
  think you ought sometimes to remember that we are only a trifle removed from
  being first cousins."</p>

  <p>"Well, I came here for every one of those reasons," he answered. "But the
  one that is most insistent just now is the first. I have been to a very
  tedious dinner with my lawyer. We have talked a good deal about things that
  happened some time ago. A lawyer's house&mdash;especially when he has never
  moved out of the Temple&mdash;has a sort of musty effect on one. I have a dry
  throat, Diana, with which preamble, I am going to beg you to have a
  drink."</p>

  <p>"In another moment," she said, "I should have had to ask you."</p>

  <p>"Tim!" Martin continued, addressing the barman, "I don't know what
  terrible concoction Madame is now engaged in consuming&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Champagne cocktail," the man interrupted.</p>

  <p>"A disgraceful drink!" Martin insisted. "Champagne is too good a wine to
  be made into a cocktail, and effervescence and cocktails don't go together at
  all. I don't know what to offer you, Diana&mdash;you must choose for
  yourself. When you are satisfied, I shall ask for a simple gin and tonic, but
  there must be a big lump of ice in it. I might mention, too, that I await it
  with impatience."</p>

  <p>"His Lordship has acquired new habits with his new dignity," Diana smiled.
  "Serve him quickly, Tim. When he is quite happy, I will decide. Do you hate
  drinking alone, Martin?"</p>

  <p>"Not so much as I should hate to have to drink with that young man who has
  just come in," Martin confided, inclining his head slightly towards the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Oh! Leversen," she answered. "I don't blame you, Martin; indeed, I can't
  think how he became a member. If ever I go out of town for a fortnight, I
  find that half the strange people of the pavements seem to be either up for
  election or to have just become members."</p>

  <p>"And yet they call yours the most exclusive show in London!" Martin
  murmured. "I read about you in the social news and I wonder how I ever got
  elected."</p>

  <p>"I sometimes wonder why you ever joined," she observed. "I don't see what
  use a night-club is to you, Martin. How old are you?"</p>

  <p>"Thirty-eight, my child," he answered. "Why don't you have a look at your
  Debrett now and then instead of embarrassing me? Only you had better be
  careful or you will be catching me up before long. That fellow,
  Leversen&mdash;" he broke off.</p>

  <p>"But why talk about him? Let me still preserve the illusion that you came
  to see me."</p>

  <p>"Darling, of course I did," he assured her. "But he always reminds me of a
  time when I got a real rise out of his terrible father."</p>

  <p>"How did you do it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Martin went on: "Well, he is about the finest criminal lawyer there is and
  has the biggest practice anywhere. They say he will get anyone off any sort
  of conviction if they go to him directly the crime's over, and tell him the
  whole truth. He will never touch any business unless he knows, or thinks he
  knows, the whole truth. Of course all the best barristers work for him, too.
  If you get a brief from the great firm of Leversen and Leversen when you are
  a rising young man at the Bar, your fortune is pretty well made."</p>

  <p>"So much for the lawyers. Tell me about that exquisitely beautiful young
  woman you brought here one night. You made us all very unhappy, Martin. Why
  can't we all have a flair and charm like that?"</p>

  <p>"I am glad you approved of her," he said calmly. "I think, myself, that in
  her quiet, distinguished way, she is very beautiful."</p>

  <p>"And her paintings!" Diana said. "After I heard who she was, I went to see
  them in that small gallery of old Simon Lebur's. Martin, they are beautiful.
  I wish I had taken to something like that&mdash;something that would have
  made me think and made me want to live with beautiful things. It's rather a
  rotten sort of show, doing this all the time."</p>

  <p>"Come! Be just to yourself," he begged. "Diana, you should never talk like
  that. I think you have a delightful range of sports and taste. You can fly a
  plane and do it properly. You are as good on a horse as anyone I ever saw. If
  you had not been Lady Diana, you would certainly have been in the front rank
  of the tennis people. You dance beautifully and you talk French, Spanish, and
  Italian. I call you a young lady of accomplishments. Why you haven't made a
  greater success of marriage I can't understand."</p>

  <p>"Ah, well&mdash;all very flattering," she sighed. "Let's leave it alone,
  Martin. How do you know? How should you know anything? Dance with me, please.
  I am the hostess-in-chief. It is your duty to ask me to dance."</p>

  <p>"Is it Leversen's duty also?" he asked, with a spice of malice twinkling
  in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Not like you, my sweet!" she answered. "From him that doesn't go."</p>

  <p>"I will dance with you with the greatest of pleasure. I shall then hope to
  be allowed to give you the drink we spoke of, which has not yet materialized.
  I shall also finish my own gin and tonic."</p>

  <p>They danced for a while in silence, perhaps because they were both experts
  enough to enjoy the movement for its own sake. Then Martin asked a
  question.</p>

  <p>"Any more tragedies in the kitchen?"</p>

  <p>"Thank goodness, no!" she answered. "The mystery of that last one is still
  unsolved."</p>

  <p>"Odd piece of business that was," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"It seems more than odd to me," Diana agreed. "Why should anyone want to
  poison one of my clients? And supposing they did want to&mdash;how could they
  so nearly have got away with it without being found out?"</p>

  <p>"As the possible client for whom those sandwiches were intended," Martin
  observed, "I am naturally somewhat interested."</p>

  <p>"I wonder you ever came here again," she declared frankly. "But I must
  tell you this, Martin&mdash;it came out in the evidence&mdash;there is a
  small stock of sandwiches which is always held in reserve. So many people who
  just get bottles of wine here ask for a sandwich when they want that bottle
  produced and they hate to wait for it. So, although you might have been
  involved, there is no certainty about it. It was the first man who asked for
  a sandwich here who was going to get the tummy-ache, whatever the chef may
  have to say about it."</p>

  <p>"I am not nervous, my dear," he assured her. "I have lived for years a
  pure and upright life. I have not, to the best of my knowledge, an enemy in
  the world, and I can't believe that immaculately clad artist of the ovens has
  any real desire to get rid of me."</p>

  <p>"You aren't troubled with nerves, are you, Martin?" she observed.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"I am," she confided with a little grimace. "I can't see one of those
  Leversens enter the place without shivering all over. The old woman comes now
  and then, and one or two of the brood seem to be always hanging round. If
  ever you hear of my selling the Club quickly, it will be because of that
  family."</p>

  <p>"Why not offer them a good round sum to resign en bloc?" Martin
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"They'd bring an action against me," she laughed. "And, as Leversen and
  Leversen have the name of winning every time they go into court, whatever the
  nature of the action is, I am not running the risk. Daddy says he has no
  money, though where it goes to I can't imagine. What are you going to do with
  your millions, Martin?"</p>

  <p>"Not buy a night-club," he assured her. "As a matter of fact, I don't
  think there are any millions. Dad&mdash;God bless him&mdash;was always the
  <i>grand seigneur</i>. Our villages and one or two of the small townships on
  the estate are perfectly built, perfectly drained, and perfectly painted
  pictures of what small houses should be like. That was what kept the dear old
  boy interested and happy to the end of his days&mdash;that and the hope that
  some day&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know all about that, Martin," she interrupted gently.</p>

  <p>"But in a way, too, he had his wish. I took the woman whom I shall marry
  some day down to see him just before he died. You may have heard about
  it?"</p>

  <p>"That was wonderful!" she said. "I simply heard there was another guest
  there."</p>

  <p>"It was the lady who was here with me one night," he told her. "The
  artist."</p>

  <p>For a moment there was complete silence. Diana was as nearly out of step
  as she had ever been in her life.</p>

  <p>"That exquisite person who married Simon Lebur's son?" she asked, a little
  hoarsely. "An Italian, wasn't she?"</p>

  <p>"That is so, Diana," he confided. "You are one of the very few to whom I
  would tell that, but there it is. Some day or other&mdash;and I tell you this
  because in the end I always get my way, however grim the circumstances
  seem&mdash;some day or other, we shall be married. And my father died,
  knowing no reason why we should not be married almost at once&mdash;knowing
  no reason why those lads he loved to picture round the place should not be
  due to make their appearance quite soon&mdash;and he died very happily."</p>

  <p>"I feel as though I had received a great rebuke. Do you mind if we sit
  down at your table?"</p>

  <p>They made their way there.</p>

  <p>"You should not feel like that, Diana," he remonstrated. "There is no
  reason for it&mdash;not the slightest. Yours was just a casual remark which
  heaps of people are always making to me. They all want to know why I don't
  marry. I am just waiting. I shall marry some day, and I shall marry
  Pamela."</p>

  <p>"You will marry one of the most beautiful creatures in the world, then,"
  Diana said quietly. "Of course one knows, Martin, you would not dream of
  going out very much just now, but, still, you can't sit in those lonely rooms
  of yours always. Father asked me the other morning whether you could not be
  brought in to dinner one night, quite quietly with us. Mother would love to
  see you, too."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I'll come with great pleasure," he promised. "You know, I have
  always stuck out about being drawn into this social whirl here in town
  because there are so many things I like to do better than going to parties,
  where I am ill-acquainted with the people&mdash;and we have not the same
  ideas, anyway. But just your old friends&mdash;of course I'll come, but don't
  have a crowd, there's a dear."</p>

  <p>"I won't, I promise you, Martin," she said. "But tell me, dear, sometimes
  you are so gay and you are always very much more interesting when we are
  alone. Did anything ever happen to you in your younger life that put you off
  people?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, I give you my word of honour," he answered. "In fact, my
  experience as a boy rather made me like people than the reverse. Only, you
  see, in a sense I think it broadened my vision. I could not stand the same
  little crowd of people, all doing the same things, all calling one another by
  their Christian name, and, not only that, but speaking of everyone else they
  ever came across in the same intimate way. Society, as you and your people
  live in it, is like a great family party. If anyone's name outside it is
  mentioned, you all look at one another in wondering surprise, <i>Who could
  this be</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Don't go on, Martin," she begged. "You will make a convert of me, too. I
  do hate the eternal grind of it all, myself, sometimes. However, I am
  striking out on my own a little nowadays. I know you go sometimes to the
  Morenstein recitals, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"I seldom miss one," he acknowledged.</p>

  <p>"Well, you would never look upon me as a musical genius, I know, but I
  practise an hour a day always and I have lessons from Morenstein. Not so bad
  for a lazy young woman who runs a night-club?"</p>

  <p>"I love you for it," he declared. "I think it is wonderful&mdash;I am
  delighted. May I add, a little surprised?"</p>

  <p>"If it won't spoil your evening, I will play to you Morenstein's last
  sonata&mdash;'The Sonata of Caprice,' as he calls it&mdash;the night you come
  to dine with us. Of course, he has never played it in public or I would never
  dare to do it, but it is beautiful. Aren't I right in believing that
  Pamela&mdash;you don't mind if I call her that?&mdash;is also a
  musician?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"She plays every day in her studio for an hour or so," he confided.
  "Sometimes I go there and listen. Tell me some more things you do that are
  unusual."</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"I could tell you two things you would never believe I was capable of.
  They help to fill up my life, which is a pretty worthless affair,
  anyway."</p>

  <p>"You keep them in reserve?"</p>

  <p>The elder of the young generation of Leversens passed their table and
  bowed to Diana. She returned his greeting without any pretence at
  cordiality.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't have thought I had literary tastes, would you?" she went on,
  continuing her conversation with Martin.</p>

  <p>"I don't see why not," he answered. "Some of your family have been quite
  well known that way, you know. The trouble of it is," he continued, with a
  twinkle in his eyes, "that they never appealed to a very large circle. Wasn't
  it your grandfather who wrote <i>The Ethics of Justice</i> with the idea of
  proving that the French and English schools of jurisprudence were founded on
  entirely different bases? The preface explaining this took up half the
  volume."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"That is right," she admitted. "Father's own father did that&mdash;and
  what a storm there was! There was no literature in that book, though. I found
  it very hard to read even the first few chapters. Dad confessed to me once
  that he had never read it through, but then, Father's peculiar. He kept a
  diary for many years with the idea of writing his memoirs, but he left off
  quite suddenly, never made another note in his diary and tore up the first
  two chapters."</p>

  <p>"We are all apt to be too impetuous sometimes," Martin sighed. "I had a
  great idea once&mdash;I won't tell you what it was about&mdash;and for weeks
  I worked on it. Then there came a day when life seemed all upside-down to me.
  I decided that even my idea must go on the ash-heap&mdash;and go there it
  did!"</p>

  <p>"Why did you come here tonight, Martin?" she asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>He looked at her a little surprised.</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask me that?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she admitted. "I sometimes get such unexpected ideas,
  Martin, that I really think I must in a way be something of a genius. When I
  saw you come into the room, I felt perfectly convinced that you had come here
  for some definite purpose. Every now and then the idea has come back and I
  have wondered. Is there anything you want from me? Had you any curiosity as
  to how our little drama in the kitchen worked out? Or was there any other
  reason?"</p>

  <p>Martin had not been smoking the whole of the evening, but he suddenly
  produced his case and lit a cigarette with great deliberation.</p>

  <p>"Odd, you should ask me that question," he ruminated.</p>

  <p>"Why odd?"</p>

  <p>"We don't often say what is in our mind."</p>

  <p>"That would have been a very natural question for me to have asked you at
  any moment. Once or twice I have felt just like putting my hand on your
  shoulder and saying, 'What made you come here tonight?'"</p>

  <p>"Do it now," he begged. "I should rather like to have your hand on my
  shoulder."</p>

  <p>"A man so hopelessly and so gloriously in love, Martin," she sighed,
  "should never trifle with a poor innocent girl's heart."</p>

  <p>"Something in that, of course," he admitted. "But patting a shoulder isn't
  a very advanced form of courtship, is it? It wouldn't be considered
  compromising, for instance?"</p>

  <p>She leaned over, carried out her threat, her long, finely-shaped fingers
  lingering for a moment on his shoulder, patted his hand and then leaned back
  in her place.</p>

  <p>"And now, my beloved," she demanded, "what brought you to the 'Evening
  Star' this particular evening?"</p>

  <p>"Well, here is your answer," he replied. "I came because in the Strand I
  saw two people talking earnestly. One of them was young Mr. Leversen who has
  just passed you with that courteous but somewhat despairing salute, and the
  other was a boy who was at one time&mdash;he may be now for all I
  know&mdash;employed under your chef in your wonderful kitchen."</p>

  <p>"And that brought you round here this evening?" she asked, a little
  bewildered.</p>

  <p>"It did," he admitted. "Now, will that cure you of asking strange
  questions? I was just wondering whether to undo a pile of books and make
  myself comfortable for an hour or so when I remembered the glimpse I caught
  of those two. My pocket-knife was open. I hesitated for a few moments and I
  closed it without cutting the string of my parcel. I rang the bell for my
  servant and I told him that I had changed my mind&mdash;I was going out; and
  I came. It was because I saw those two standing at that particular corner in
  close conversation."</p>

  <p>"But, why?" Diana persisted.</p>

  <p>"Vicious, overpowering curiosity."</p>

  <p>"But, why shouldn't they have been talking together?"</p>

  <p>"Why should they?" he argued. "What possible link could there be between
  Mr. Samuel Leversen and your cook-boy?"</p>

  <p>"Well, they were fellow-witnesses in the same inquest," she pointed out.
  "Leversen probably took down the boy's evidence."</p>

  <p>"But, I ask you!" Martin protested. "Look across the room at this minute.
  Look at Mr. Samuel Leversen&mdash;a snob, isn't he? I should say, an utter
  and complete snob."</p>

  <p>Diana assented.</p>

  <p>"Then why should he preserve an acquaintance with a cook-boy just because
  they came together in this casual manner?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a twinkle in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Martin, you astonish me," she declared. "This is the policeman cropping
  up, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"You may be right," he admitted. "The policeman sometimes retains a
  curiosity in cases over and done with. The lawyer, having been paid his fee,
  would certainly have no more interest in it. That might explain these two
  meeting at the corner of a street and commencing a conversation which they
  were evidently carrying on with emphasis, gestures, and interest."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I can't help it, Martin," she answered, "but I can't feel myself able to
  develop the slightest grain of curiosity as to those two wearisome people
  talking at the corner of the Strand or associating them in any way with your
  being here this evening. Of course, I should rather you had said 'To see
  you,' but, since it did not occur to you to be gallant, I am willing to
  accept any reason. You saw a cook-boy connected with this Club talking to one
  of the members&mdash;all right! I asked the question and I am answered. Wait
  one moment, though!"</p>

  <p>She leaned forward and gave a message to a passing waiter. He disappeared
  hastily towards the service department.</p>

  <p>"I am beginning to be ashamed of what really was, I suppose, very childish
  curiosity," Martin declared. "Perhaps it doesn't matter so very much, after
  all. But, anyhow, I have found out one or two interesting things about you,
  Diana, through my visit, haven't I?"</p>

  <p>"That I play the piano?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that really does interest me," he admitted. "I have never
  thoroughly disliked anyone who played the piano well, and I am perfectly
  certain that you never attempt anything that you don't do well."</p>

  <p>"Don't wait for the dinner," she begged. "You shall have a private recital
  any afternoon or evening you choose, Martin!"</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow at six?"</p>

  <p>"I am very grateful for your choosing tomorrow evening at six," she
  smiled, "because it gets me out of a stupid cocktail party."</p>

  <p>"I shall be there."</p>

  <p>Gustave, the chef, made his way respectfully to the table.</p>

  <p>"My Lady wished to speak to me?"</p>

  <p>"Answer me a question, will you?" Diana replied with a little nod. "You
  once had a boy&mdash;Adolph, I think was his name&mdash;whom you occasionally
  allowed to bring special dishes with you from the kitchen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed, Madame," the chef broke in. "But at my special request Mr.
  Branson dismissed him after his carelessness in leaving Monsieur's sandwiches
  lying about. I could not tolerate such inattention."</p>

  <p>"Do you know where he went to?"</p>

  <p>"I have not heard the subject mentioned, your Ladyship," was the quiet
  reply. "I only trust sincerely that he never sets foot in this place again. I
  will not have boys in my kitchen on whom I cannot rely implicitly."</p>

  <p>Diana dismissed him with a little wave of her hand.</p>

  <p>"Well, there you are, Martin," she pointed out. "The young man was
  dismissed. He probably met Mr. Leversen, whom he would recognize as a member
  of the Club, and he stopped to do a little begging on his own account.
  Considering it was Mr. Leversen's evidence that exposed the lad's
  carelessness, I think he had rather a nerve&mdash;but there you are!
  Curiosity satisfied?"</p>

  <p>"Completely."</p>

  <p>Diana rose to her feet to respond to an urgent call from the
  secretary.</p>

  <p>"I must return to the world of affairs. Don't dance with any of my little
  butterflies, Martin, or I shall be jealous. And remember, I shall expect you
  punctually at six o'clock tomorrow evening."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <p>Martin was without a doubt very susceptible to music and he listened to
  Diana's playing on the following afternoon with keen pleasure. She lacked the
  grace and easy flow of Pamela's sweeping fingers, nor had she the same
  delicacy of touch, but her execution was wonderful and she had evidently made
  a great study of the particular composer to whose work they were both
  devoted. For an hour or more Martin was happily and completely enthralled. He
  rose to leave with genuine reluctance.</p>

  <p>"I have loved playing to you, Martin," she told him. "Your father was the
  first person who really encouraged me. You know how fond he was of what a
  great many people call 'the barbaric note' in music. I suppose it must have
  appealed a little to me, too. I have strong wrists and I think sometimes I am
  disposed to make too much of my physical strength. But I can't help
  it&mdash;we all have our faults and I am grateful for such gifts as I
  possess. The creation of melody of any sort is wonderful. Are you going to
  stay and see Father? He will be back presently."</p>

  <p>"I would like to see your father," Martin assured her, "but I cannot
  tonight. Any news from Lionel lately?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Lionel's news is never very good to have," she sighed.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," Martin regretted. "At one time he seemed to be settling down
  so well in India."</p>

  <p>"We all hoped he might," she replied. "I am afraid it's all up with that
  job now, though. We had a telegram from Bombay to say that he is on the way
  home. Dad didn't tell me for some days, but I could see he was worrying about
  something. I'm afraid he's given up his post. However, I didn't ask you here
  to worry you about our family affairs, Martin. Perhaps you will come and dine
  one night next week quietly. We did arrange that the other day, didn't we? I
  believe Father would love to talk to you about it."</p>

  <p>"I will come with pleasure, as I promised, if you don't mind making it a
  small party," he begged. "I can't tell you how sorry I am, Diana."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I dare say it's nothing serious," she said. "He has been declaring
  for a long time that the climate did not agree with him, but his time for
  leave is not up yet, so we don't quite understand it."</p>

  <p>"Can I ask a question of an old friend, Diana?"</p>

  <p>"You can ask me anything you like," she told him after a moment's
  hesitation. "I won't promise to answer."</p>

  <p>"The Club?" he asked. "Is it paying financially?"</p>

  <p>She made no answer for a moment. She was standing by the piano and seemed
  to be engaged, picking out the notes of an old melody. Suddenly she left
  off.</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask me that just now?"</p>

  <p>"You don't look your usual bright self," he explained, "and I don't like
  you to be worried about trifles."</p>

  <p>"Why should you care?" she asked bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, we are quite old friends, aren't we?" he protested. "Why not answer
  my question?"</p>

  <p>"Well, the Club started well enough," she owned. "But recently it has been
  getting wobbly. It is not doing anything like as well as it was. In fact, I
  am a little worried about it."</p>

  <p>"Your father doesn't altogether approve of it, does he?"</p>

  <p>"He hates it," the girl admitted. "That is why I shall rather hate going
  to him for money. All the same, I'm afraid I may have to."</p>

  <p>"Is the secretary all right?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He's honest," Diana confided, "but he is not a financial genius."</p>

  <p>Martin walked thoughtfully to the window and back again.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Diana," he said, "I never like to see my friends trouble about
  things that really aren't worth while. You tried to make the place pay and
  you worked jolly hard at it. The thing is&mdash;can the running of it be
  altered to make it pay, do you think?"</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," she replied. "I sometimes feel inclined to throw up my
  hands, tell Dad the whole truth, ask him for the money, however much it is,
  and wind it up."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't do that for the moment," Martin advised. "I tell you what,
  Diana&mdash;I am a man of figures myself just now. That is to say, the
  accountants are setting up a proper scheme for keeping books for the estates
  as they should be kept. Will you let me send someone in to look through your
  system of book-keeping and see if there is any chance of making the concern
  pay? It won't cost you anything, and if he gives a favourable report, we
  might be able to arrange something in the way of a small company. I would
  take some shares with pleasure."</p>

  <p>"You are good, Martin!" she exclaimed. "That was just the sort of idea I
  had in my mind. But why should you go to all this trouble?"</p>

  <p>"Friends, my dear," he answered. "We do things for our friends, don't we?
  Or what is the good of having any? Will you tell your secretary that I will
  send someone round there tomorrow morning at eleven o'clock?"</p>

  <p>"He will have to spend a few evenings there as well, to look round and see
  the way the place is being run. I will see that he is entertained properly,"
  Diana promised. "You are a brick, Martin! Why aren't there more like you in
  the world, I wonder?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Martin drove slowly away in the direction of Pamela's studio, feeling a
  little puzzled. He went in to pay his usual evening call and found her
  happily at work.</p>

  <p>"Simon's been round," she told Martin. "Quite like his old self. I got
  something from him I haven't had for ages. I got just that fixed look of
  lowering intelligence which he used to have when he bought or sold a picture.
  It's the old Jewish trait in him that I have missed lately, but it is so
  important to his portrait as a whole."</p>

  <p>"Dear old fellow," Martin murmured. "I hope you didn't tire him out?"</p>

  <p>"He had three cups of tea," she confided, "and, for once in his life, he
  admitted that my tea was as good as his!"</p>

  <p>"No news?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"He never mentioned his son at all. He seems completely to have vanished
  from the news, too. I wonder if he really has got away?"</p>

  <p>"Shouldn't be surprised," Martin observed. "He would, I think, have every
  chance of success, unless he trusted that woman."</p>

  <p>"You think," she ventured, "that she would make another effort to give him
  away?"</p>

  <p>"I am sure of it, dear," he replied. "There are bad women and good women
  of that type, you know, Pamela. She is one of the bad ones."</p>

  <p>"There was Mary Magdalene," Pamela pondered.</p>

  <p>He shook his head dubiously.</p>

  <p>"Authentic records, my dear, of the past life of that lady are missing,
  you must remember. The little we know of her dates from after her
  purification."</p>

  <p>"By the by, did you bring me any message from your delightful Mrs.
  Janien?" she asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't," he replied. "I haven't been home since breakfast-time. I
  lunched at the Club."</p>

  <p>"Then I ask you, my dear one, where do we dine?"</p>

  <p>"And I reply, as always, wherever you wish. Was I to have brought a
  message about dinner?"</p>

  <p>"I rang up this morning," she confided, "and I could get no definite
  answer. 'Unless His Lordship changed his mind,' I was told, 'we were dining
  here.'"</p>

  <p>"That sounds very pleasant," he declared. "It's a queer thing, Pamela,
  that since we started our delightful in-and-out dining arrangement, I have
  not cared where we dined. I don't think I do now, really. Your cook is at
  least as good as mine. So long as we dine together, it doesn't seem to make
  the slightest difference."</p>

  <p>"Nor to me," she agreed. "Only I rather like to see you at the head of the
  table. You look so imposing sometimes, Martin."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes!" he sniffed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm not going to spoil you," she went on. "I distinctly saw you look
  peevish at a guinea-fowl the other night."</p>

  <p>"I don't like guinea-fowl," he confessed.</p>

  <p>"You should never display your feelings so openly as a guest."</p>

  <p>"So far as I remember, I was not a guest," he reminded her. "I was the
  fool who ordered the <i>pintade</i>."</p>

  <p>"Well, you are apparently dining with me tonight. Supposing my cook has
  ordered a guinea-fowl?"</p>

  <p>"You shall see what I do to it," he answered. "I am rather hungry, as a
  matter of fact."</p>

  <p>"What, before your cocktail?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I have been hearing bad news. That always gives me an appetite."</p>

  <p>"You mean, getting rid of it does?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so. A man in the Indian Civil Service whom I used to know very
  well seems to have chucked his job and is coming home. I am sorry."</p>

  <p>"Anyone I know?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The brother of Diana Malladene who runs the night-club," he told her.
  "I'm afraid it will worry the old man, and he is such a dear."</p>

  <p>"Well, I am sorry. How can I cheer you up about it, Martin?"</p>

  <p>"Wear your grey silk with the high neck and the little bit of lace round
  the top and the long loose sleeves," he begged. "I am dining with you, aren't
  I?"</p>

  <p>"That has been my frantic hope all day," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Well, we will come here after dinner and drink our coffee in the
  twilight," he insisted. "We will have the chairs, not in your
  painting-window&mdash;the other one&mdash;and we will look down at the River,
  and when the tide turns we will watch those clumsy boats come up. It would
  perhaps add a little charm to the situation if you let me move the divan and
  we sat side by side."</p>

  <p>She laughed as she rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>"You are a dear to be such a baby about my clothes, Martin," she said.
  "Grey ought not to suit me, you know," she wound up, "but I do feel so like
  Florence when I wear it&mdash;I can't help it."</p>

  <p>"I have it on the best of authority," he assured her, "that the Signora
  Andrea del Sarto&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The lady with the cousin?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;the lady with the cousin&mdash;" he agreed, "seldom wore any other
  colour."</p>

  <p>"Instinct again. Only, instead of Fiesole, you must watch barges."</p>

  <p>He rose swiftly and passed her on her way to the door.</p>

  <p>"If on your way to your room," he whispered, "the kitchen door should be
  open and Hannah&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She pressed her hand upon his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Not another word," she insisted. "Besides, if she has chosen that
  unfortunate bird, I happen to know that there is a sole first and it's our
  duty not to over-eat, this hot weather."</p>

  <p>"A sole first!" he exclaimed cheerfully, as she removed her hand. "You
  would have dissipated all anxiety in a moment if you had told me that. The
  penalty"&mdash;he kissed her eyes lightly, one by one&mdash;"is this."</p>

  <p>"And now, of course, I shan't want to bathe my eyes," she laughed, looking
  back as she disappeared.</p>

  <p>Martin, his hands behind his back, walked slowly up and down the long,
  lofty room, with its shadows and sunlit corners. He had come in brooding over
  another man's unhappiness. Now he could think of nothing else except that
  slight shadow which stole up now and then, a menacing cloud, over his own
  complete content. Suddenly, he stopped short. Just an idea&mdash;a gleam of
  hope! He sat down in the chair by the side of Pamela's telephone, drew out
  the book and searched until he found a number.</p>

  <p>"1312 Southside," he asked for.</p>

  <p>There was no immediate response. Then a woman replied, drawling, a little
  artificial, in a voice ill-pitched and not naturally pleasant.</p>

  <p>"Is that Mrs. Culpepper?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It is, and who might you be?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you know, we didn't go very far in the way of names those few
  minutes we talked together at the Gigantic Hotel."</p>

  <p>"Is that really you?" she asked, with a complete change in her tone. "You
  bad man! All this time&mdash;and you promised to ring up at once."</p>

  <p>"I have been a long distance away," he told her, "down in the country.
  Besides, I thought you were staying at the Gigantic Hotel for some time."</p>

  <p>"They were such terrible people there," she confided. "I had to come away.
  Besides, there were domestic complications. I must not tell you about those,
  though. When are you coming to see me?"</p>

  <p>"When will you be at home?" he answered.</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow afternoon at half-past four," she told him. "Not a moment before
  that, and you can only stay two hours."</p>

  <p>"Two what?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Two hours. Isn't that long enough?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, we will see about that," he evaded. "Two hours seem rather a long
  time to me for an afternoon visit."</p>

  <p>"Well, I shall be very glad to see you, anyway," she assured him. "That's
  very nice of me after all your promises."</p>

  <p>"I never made any promises," he said firmly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't get on your high horse with me," the lady replied. "Perhaps you
  didn't. Perhaps I am the fool for thinking that you did. You come at
  half-past four tomorrow and don't you be five minutes late or else I may not
  forgive you so easily this time."</p>

  <p>"Righto!" he promised.</p>

  <p>Pamela returned, having completed her toilet, to find Martin with a smile
  upon his lips.</p>

  <p>"Something has happened," she exclaimed as she glided across the room to
  meet him, "which has given you pleasure&mdash;and I was not here. You have
  been using my telephone! I insist upon knowing with whom you have been
  talking."</p>

  <p>"Never," he declared, "was a man in a more difficult position."</p>

  <p>"I thought so. You look guilty. Confess, or I shan't come a step
  nearer."</p>

  <p>He took one step towards her.</p>

  <p>"I can think it over better from here," he confided.</p>

  <p>"Were you talking to a man or a woman?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"A woman," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Don't move an inch!" she ordered. "Tell me the type."</p>

  <p>"A loose woman," he acknowledged.</p>

  <p>"Martin!"</p>

  <p>"Well," he answered, moving a little nearer still.</p>

  <p>"I forbid you to move," she insisted.</p>

  <p>"And I implore you to come," he protested, holding out his arms.</p>

  <p>She rested there for some time, then she drew away, trying in vain to
  smooth her hair.</p>

  <p>"You really are terrible, Martin," she complained. "If your arms weren't
  so long and if I didn't adore your kisses so much&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That is what keeps me at telephone length from everyone else." He smiled.
  "Well, I had an idea, Pamela. I thought there might be something else
  squeezed out from the woman in the case."</p>

  <p>"That terrible woman who calls herself Mrs. Culpepper?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"You know best," she remarked. "I admire your good taste as regards the
  telephone, though."</p>

  <p>They wandered arm-in-arm over to a side-table. Everything was set out
  there as usual. Blocks of ice fresh from the refrigerator, little strips of
  lemon peel, and two lemons cut in half.</p>

  <p>"Shall I put you out of your misery?" she asked, as she placed half a
  lemon on the squeezer.</p>

  <p>"I am not in any misery," he declared. "I am one of the happiest men in
  London. I am going to have a White Lady given me by you."</p>

  <p>"You will never be able to keep it up, Martin," she declared sadly.</p>

  <p>"You wait!" he warned her.</p>

  <p>"Well, here's the truth, then," she said. "I did look in at the kitchen.
  Hannah had remembered about the <i>pintade</i>. Never another bird of that
  description will visit our cooking range. In fact, she agrees with you.
  Tonight we have Dover sole, ortolans with white grapes and raspberries."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, Pamela," he declared, "but no man could have such a menu
  recited to him by the girl he loves, without&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What, another kiss!" she sighed, holding up her lips.</p>

  <p>"What makes you feel so perfectly frivolous tonight, I wonder?" Pamela
  speculated, as the parlourmaid flitted out of the room.</p>

  <p>"Can't imagine," he answered. "It's in my blood. It's something breaking
  loose in me. I feel rather as I did that day when we started on our picnic,
  going down to Devonshire."</p>

  <p>"I hope it lasts," she went on.</p>

  <p>"Through the days and through the years, my love," he assured her.
  "Especially if Hannah remains your cook! The time will come, you know&mdash;I
  am perfectly sure of that, Pamela; I never felt so sure of it in my
  life&mdash;when we shall set up our own little establishment. It really
  needn't be little," he went on. "In fact, I'm afraid the time will come when
  we may have to reopen the mansion. But whether it's small or large, I'm
  perfectly certain that I shall retain exactly the outlook upon life that I
  have at present, so long as you keep just as far away from me as you are now
  and never a yard farther."</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure about that sentence, Martin," she demurred, smiling.
  "Have you tripped a little?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you can come as much closer as you will, dear. In fact&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sit down, please," she begged. "I hear steps outside."</p>

  <p>"The gentle Leida," he murmured. "You certainly scored, but, for fear
  there should be any misunderstanding, let me tell you that the place I like
  you best is in my arms."</p>

  <p>"It is reassuring," she murmured.</p>

  <p>Leida came in with a telegram on a small salver. With an apologetic word
  to her guest, Pamela tore it open and read it.</p>

  <p>"An unsigned telegram from Simon," she confided. She passed it over to him
  at once.</p><br>

  <p class="telegram"><tt>OUR VISITOR FROM THE WEST REPORTS ALL WELL AND HOPES
  TO ATTAIN COMPLETE SECURITY AT THE END OF WEEK. MEANWHILE HE URGENTLY DEMANDS
  BRIEF INTERVIEW WITH MARTIN. COULD YOU ARRANGE THAT HERE THIS EVENING. HAVE
  TELEPHONED MARTIN. THEY REPORTED DINING WITH YOU. TELEPHONE
  REPLY</tt></p><br>

  <p>Martin smiled.</p>

  <p>"I knew something good was going to happen," he declared. "That fellow's
  got something up his sleeve that may be just what we need to help
  Richard."</p>

  <p>"May I telephone that you will be there?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he answered. "You, too, I should think."</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see?" he pointed out. "Suppose he has gone off the rails again.
  This might be a ruse to find you easily and alone. Mind you, I don't think
  it's possible, but, where you are concerned, I shall never take a risk."</p>

  <p>She patted his cheek.</p>

  <p>"Of course, you're right, dear. I shall come to Simon's with you. Very
  likely there will be no need for me to see Richard. Seriously, though,
  Martin," she went on, as she put down the receiver and afterwards resumed her
  seat, "what help is there, beyond what we have done, that we could give
  him?"</p>

  <p>"My dear," he replied, "I should only be building up false hopes if I
  started guessing. I only know that it will come some day, our freedom, and
  it's just as likely to come through a miracle as in any other manner. Look!
  One of your cook's cheese omelettes! A course of dinners here would make me
  very greedy."</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"You are certainly a very charming guest this evening, Martin," she
  declared.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he suggested, "I may be an even more charming supper companion.
  We may come back brimful of news."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>They found Simon Lebur curiously well when they called together at the
  time he had appointed. He was looking, for him, almost happy. He sent Pamela
  into the music-room while he took Martin into his small, untidy study. His
  secretary, who looked almost as old as he did, took his leave at a gesture
  from his employer.</p>

  <p>"I was anxious to speak with you, Lord Brockenhurst," he said quietly.
  "Very anxious, indeed, because I know how much you have suffered through this
  terrible business. I saw my son only a few hours ago. He has been back with
  that woman&mdash;living with her in a quiet flat, Battersea way."</p>

  <p>"Don't distress yourself too much, Simon," Martin begged him. "There's no
  hurry. If ever anything fresh is to come to light, it must be through that
  woman."</p>

  <p>"This tragedy," Simon Lebur went on, "has hurt you badly, Martin
  Brockenhurst, but it has hurt me differently. I never hesitated to
  believe&mdash;horrible thought though it was&mdash;that my son was a
  murderer, a cold-blooded murderer, too, for the sake of a wanton woman. Doubt
  has come to me. I feel there is a chance, a great chance after all, that he
  is innocent. It may be that he has wilfully taken up another person's burden
  of shame. If that is so, after all, there is something of the heroic in
  Richard. He is not so bad as I have feared him."</p>

  <p>"In plain words, you think that he may have been shielding the woman?"</p>

  <p>"I think that it is possible," Simon Lebur admitted. "And there is another
  thing. I believe that they have somehow or other the same idea at Scotland
  Yard. I believe that they could have taken him once lately, if not twice.
  They let him go&mdash;why? There was no other reason. If they failed to
  arrest him, it must have been because they were waiting to be able to nail
  the truth on to the guilty person, so that two things could have come
  together&mdash;Richard's justification and the other's arrest."</p>

  <p>Martin was suddenly depressed. All that Simon Lebur was struggling to tell
  him might be the truth, but, if so, who was the one who had weakened? Who was
  the one who was coming to the front and going to tell the whole story?</p>

  <p>"Tell me the rest, Simon," Martin begged, "but don't hurry. You are out of
  breath now. Take it quietly, please. Tell me just what your son said to
  you."</p>

  <p>"It's so ghastly a story," Simon said. "There are times when I tell myself
  it must all be a bad dream. Richard was never a liar. When he was a boy he
  had many faults, but I never remember his telling a deliberate
  falsehood."</p>

  <p>"But, Simon," Martin reminded him gently, "you have told me nothing new.
  You say that you have seen your son. Did he come to you here?"</p>

  <p>"He came here," Simon admitted. "And I can't help believing that the man
  whom I saw strolling up and down outside my house some of the time that he
  was here was from Scotland Yard and was watching him."</p>

  <p>"Yet there was no arrest&mdash;nothing of that sort happening?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," Simon Lebur replied; "and that's perhaps the centre of my new
  hopes."</p>

  <p>Martin was disappointed. He was also puzzled.</p>

  <p>"I hoped you had something more definite to tell me," he confessed. "But,
  in any case, what you have told me is interesting. I have had some
  experience, as you know, and I can't conceive Scotland Yard treating your son
  the way they are doing."</p>

  <p>The old man leaned across the table and tapped with his pencil.</p>

  <p>"Can't you see?" he pointed out. "There could be only one reason for it.
  They have come to the conclusion that he was not guilty."</p>

  <p>"Then why the mischief isn't something done about it?" Martin asked. "Why
  isn't the case reopened? Or why doesn't someone in the House of Commons ask a
  question and challenge the Police as to why they make no attempt to rearrest
  an escaped convict who was found guilty of a serious crime?"</p>

  <p>Simon Lebur smiled.</p>

  <p>"You have interested yourself in the case, Lord Brockenhurst," he said.
  "You are a man now of distinction and weight in the country. It is for you to
  make a move."</p>

  <p>"But how am I to get at Richard?" Martin demanded. "I should want to have
  some new facts to go upon before I flung myself at Scotland Yard again. I
  have had one go at them, you know."</p>

  <p>"They know more than they knew then," the old man declared feverishly.
  "You take a turn down that way, Lord Brockenhurst."</p>

  <p>Martin picked up his hat.</p>

  <p>"You are all very mysterious," he said. "All the same, I will follow your
  advice, Simon. I will call at the Old Shop and have a few more words with the
  Chief Inspector."</p>

  <p>Simon picked up his stick and hobbled to the door with his guest.</p>

  <p>"Let me know," he begged. "Let me know the moment you hear anything. I am
  not too strong these days, Lord Brockenhurst. I have prayed each day that I
  might live long enough to see Richard a free man once more. I want that to
  happen, but I want other people to see him, too. I want them to know that he
  is a free man because the authorities have decided that he was not
  guilty."</p>

  <p>"I will go and see if there is anything more to be done," Martin promised.
  "But, remember, Simon, it was a cast-iron case&mdash;don't expect too
  much."</p>

  <p>Simon Lebur was looking up towards the ceiling. He made no answer. He
  simply hurried his visitor away.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>"Now, my friend," were Martin's first words when he presented himself in
  Inspector Charlesworth's office next morning, "you are up against it."</p>

  <p>"Really?" was the somewhat frigid reply. "Who gave you leave to walk into
  a Sub-Commissioner's office and address him in that style?"</p>

  <p>"Since when?"</p>

  <p>"Forty-eight hours."</p>

  <p>"My hearty congratulations!" Martin declared warmly. "You deserve it,
  Charlesworth. I won't say that your handling of this case in which I am
  particularly interested has been exactly brilliant, but, still, you have had
  the sense to keep an open mind for a long time&mdash;six or seven years,
  isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Now, what have you got to say about that case this morning?" the new
  Sub-Commissioner asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"I have come to hear if you have anything fresh to tell me about it. I
  have also come to know whether you are taking any steps to arrest this
  escaped convict, who seems to be strolling about London when and where he
  pleases."</p>

  <p>"Not quite like that, your Lordship," Charlesworth protested.</p>

  <p>"Don't 'your Lordship' me, Sub-Commissioner," Martin replied. "But,
  seriously, what are we going to do about this?"</p>

  <p>"Why are you so infernally interested?"</p>

  <p>A moment later the Sub-Commissioner would have very much liked to withdraw
  his words. There was a light in Martin's eyes that he had never seen there
  before, something in the stiffening of his manner which warned him of the
  unknown.</p>

  <p>"I have my reasons, Charlesworth, but they are not reasons I can talk
  about. I have gone as far as this before. I have told you that I am deeply
  and seriously interested in the case. I am more so now than ever. I thought
  that I had all that I wanted, but I was a selfish brute and I got it in the
  neck. Now, if anything, I am more eager than ever for the truth."</p>

  <p>"Sit down," the Sub-Commissioner invited.</p>

  <p>Martin, who had been pacing up and down the room all the time, sank into a
  comfortable chair.</p>

  <p>"Well," he sighed, "here I am."</p>

  <p>"What you really want to know, I suppose," Charlesworth meditated, "is why
  Scotland Yard are, apparently, not particularly eager upon the rearrest of an
  escaped Dartmoor criminal?"</p>

  <p>"There are times, Charlesworth," Martin said slowly, "when your
  intelligence appears to me to be nothing short of phenomenal. Get on with it,
  then. Why don't you lighten the sorrows of the Governor of Dartmoor Prison
  and hand him back his little piece of treasure, who has no business at all
  wandering in the London streets?"</p>

  <p>"Well, we keep our eye on him," the Sub-Commissioner pointed out. "And he
  has about as much chance of obtaining a passport and scuttling off to foreign
  countries as I have of becoming Chief Commissioner. But, on the other hand,
  it would suit our book better if some enthusiastic philanthropist who had
  Lebur's case on his mind and conscience were to take the initial steps in the
  matter."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you take the lady's word for it? She's had a word or two with
  you, hasn't she?"</p>

  <p>The Sub-Commissioner appeared shocked.</p>

  <p>"My dear Lord Brockenhurst," he expostulated, "you don't suppose Scotland
  Yard exists for the purpose of encouraging crime, do you? You don't suppose
  that we should really be interested in allowing a lady who, out of pure
  kind-heartedness, has ventured to give us a piece of information she thought
  might be useful, to face the assassin's knife or revolver, or whatever he
  might choose to use? No, sir, we couldn't do that. We are not going to
  encourage the lady to tell us anything. Besides, you know, it is astonishing
  how often the lady's evidence goes wrong for some reason or other, and,
  furthermore, this&mdash;if Richard Lebur has been shielding that woman all
  these years, why should he suddenly throw up the game?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you are clever devils," Martin acknowledged. "You have got to see
  your way perfectly clear ahead, haven't you, before you move? Well, have it
  your own way. Tell me how a blundering philanthropist could stumble into this
  matter and succeed in keeping a poor fellow from being dragged back to
  Dartmoor, and succeed, also, in clearing him of the crime he never
  committed?"</p>

  <p>Charlesworth stroked his moustache for a moment carefully. He was looking
  at his visitor with blank eyes. Here was, he decided, a genuine and real
  philanthropist. He knew Martin to be furiously in love with Lebur's wife, and
  he knew him to be just as anxious to keep Lebur out of prison.</p>

  <p>"Well, bearing in mind your final object," he said, "I should do what we
  would like to do ourselves and daren't. We should like to walk into the
  offices of Messrs. Leversen and Leversen, and we should like to ask for an
  interview with the senior member of the firm, and we should like to ask
  him&mdash;whether under the seal of confidence or not&mdash;precisely why a
  member of that famous firm in the middle of that very sensational trial leant
  across to the doomed man&mdash;and he was doomed, mind, at that
  time&mdash;and gave the prisoner a certain piece of advice, a piece of advice
  which led to his changing his plea and saved his neck at the expense of his
  liberty."</p>

  <p>"Well, there are no cross-purposes about our game, at any rate," Martin
  said, with a smile. "You know what you are after, Charlesworth, as well as I
  do. Perhaps I can give you a little bit of a shaking, though. Over a year ago
  I did precisely what you have suggested."</p>

  <p>The Sub-Commissioner was frankly startled.</p>

  <p>"What was the reply?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"Exactly what you might expect. I was an unknown, retired police-constable
  at that time, and I was ordered to leave the offices and never, under any
  circumstances, to enter them again. What do you think of that,
  Sub-Commissioner?"</p>

  <p>"Of whom did you ask that question?"</p>

  <p>"Of Sir Frederick Leversen."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Charlesworth observed. "I wonder what the result would be if you,
  Lord Brockenhurst, were to ask the same question again?"</p>

  <p>"You think it would be different?"</p>

  <p>"With such a man," Charlesworth replied, "you never can tell."</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure that the interests of the firm would prompt them to
  deliver a different reply. Strange though it may seem, there have been cases
  known in legal history where the interests of the firm have been placed above
  the interests of the individual."</p>

  <p>"You have been quite right all the time in some of your surmises, Lord
  Brockenhurst. I don't believe that Richard Lebur killed David Culpepper. It's
  a sad confession to make, but I make it."</p>

  <p>"And your suggestion?"</p>

  <p>"I suggest that you start the business by asking that question once more,
  you yourself, mind, and ask it of Sir Frederick himself."</p>

  <p>Martin glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"This very morning," he said, "the mine shall be sprung."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>It was barely half an hour later when Brockenhurst entered the modernized
  and very fine offices of Leversen and Leversen. He paused for a few moments
  studying the list of partners on a mahogany board and noting with whom an
  interview might be possible and those who at that moment were sternly denying
  themselves to all callers. The majority of the firm, he discovered, were out,
  which meant that they were either engaged in some great financial scheme or
  endeavouring to aid some distinguished client to escape from the meshes of
  the Law. Supposing that neither of those assumptions was correct, Martin
  decided that they might have gone to their clubs early for lunch.</p>

  <p>He abandoned the meditation with a little shrug of the shoulders, paused
  to light a cigarette and was turning away, having read that Sir Frederick was
  out, when he suddenly felt a little touch upon the shoulder. A fulsome and
  yet rather troubled voice sounded in his ear. It was scarcely a year since
  their last few remarks had passed between them and Sir Frederick Leversen had
  changed very little. His complexion was still waxen, his eyes had retained
  their ferret-like shape.</p>

  <p>"This is surely Lord Brockenhurst," he said. "Oh, yes, I am sure it is
  Lord Brockenhurst. Was your Lordship by any chance planning a call upon any
  member of our firm? I noticed that you were studying the board."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I was," Martin acknowledged. "I was about to enquire
  if I could have a few minutes' conversation with Sir Frederick, and I
  honestly believe&mdash;indeed I certainly recognize&mdash;that you are he. I
  was remarking to Lady Diana only the other night, at a club which we do not
  talk about too freely in this august neighbourhood, on the resemblance
  between yourself and your son, who was pointed out to me."</p>

  <p>Sir Frederick smiled, but it was not a very pleasant gesture.</p>

  <p>"Ah! yes. My younger people go there quite often. I, too, have visited the
  'Evening Star' on one occasion," he admitted. "Amusing little
  place&mdash;good food, too."</p>

  <p>"Except the ham sandwiches," Martin observed, inspired by some spark of
  devilment. "Yes, it's a very pleasant place, Sir Frederick. But I didn't come
  here to talk to you about the 'Evening Star.' You weren't there last night by
  any chance, were you?"</p>

  <p>"I was not," was the prompt reply. "Why should you ask?"</p>

  <p>"Well, to tell you the truth, you look a little pale about the gills this
  morning. You look as though someone had taken you by surprise."</p>

  <p>"Very good of your Lordship to notice," Leversen observed. "If you had a
  little matter of business to go into with the firm," he added, "perhaps you
  would do me the honour of mounting to my private room. I should be delighted
  to see if there is anything we could do for you."</p>

  <p>"Take care of my estates, I suppose?" Martin asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>Sir Frederick Leversen held up his hands, half ecstatically, half in
  horrified fashion.</p>

  <p>"We should never presume to hope that your Lordship would place that much
  confidence in us," he said. "Besides, as a matter of fact, it really is not
  in our line of country. We are criminal lawyers."</p>

  <p>"Well, I will come with you and ask my question," Martin agreed. "I will
  begin by asking a favour. I am used to being addressed as 'your Lordship'
  rather too often by the waiters at the Club, who think that because the title
  is new to me, out of sheer kindness of heart they will use it often that I
  may accustom myself to my new dignities. I have now reached that point. An
  occasional 'Lord Brockenhurst' in a business conversation like ours is in
  order, but not so much of it, there's a good fellow!"</p>

  <p>"Just as your&mdash;just as you wish," Sir Frederick replied. "Will you
  follow me, Lord Brockenhurst?"</p>

  <p>They passed along a broad passage-way, up and down which countless young
  men, mostly bespectacled and mostly carrying basketfuls of letters, were
  rushing. At last they entered a door towards the end of the row, upon which
  was painted, in white letters, <span class="smcap">Sir Frederick
  Leversen</span>.</p>

  <p>Martin entered and followed his host a moment or two later to a desk-table
  at the end of the room. The young lady who was occupying a seat opposite a
  typewriter was waved unceremoniously away. This time Sir Frederick was not
  going to be robbed of his cheaply won glory.</p>

  <p>"Unless your Lordship has notes to give me which might require a shorthand
  transcriber," he suggested, "the young lady might leave us."</p>

  <p>"I have no notes to give you of any sort," Martin told him, with a
  pleasant smile at the disappearing figure. "The young lady will excuse our
  unceremonious entrance, I am sure. I shall sit opposite you at the table and
  our few words, Sir Frederick, will not require an audience."</p>

  <p>Once more the great lawyer was becoming a little uneasy. His fears,
  however, were all too vague to materialize. He seated himself in a
  comfortable leather chair and leaned forward towards his visitor in a gesture
  of polite attention.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

  <p>"Will you smoke?" Sir Frederick asked, as he pushed a handsomely decorated
  box across the desk. "These are very good tobacco, I believe."</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much," Martin replied. "I won't smoke. I came to have a
  few words with you, Sir Frederick, about a case which I expect you have
  almost forgotten."</p>

  <p>Sir Frederick looked very much as though it certainly was a case which he
  had forgotten. He also looked as though he wished devoutly that it was a case
  that he had never heard of and that his present visitor had no real
  existence.</p>

  <p>"The name of the case?" he murmured.</p>

  <p>"The Lebur murder case," Martin confided. "The Crown, I believe, were
  represented as usual in such cases by Herriott White. You briefed Charles
  Margate and Stokes&mdash;both of them very prominent in those days but,
  unfortunately, both dead at the present moment."</p>

  <p>Leversen was pulling himself together in great style, but he was very pale
  and there was something about his manner which suggested an intense distaste
  for the subject of their conversation.</p>

  <p>"I remember the case perfectly," he pronounced, "because there was a very
  singular episode connected with it. The prisoner was permitted by the Judge,
  at my request, to change his plea to one of 'Guilty.'"</p>

  <p>"That is the episode which is responsible for my visit," Martin
  confided.</p>

  <p>"Another unusual episode," Sir Frederick continued, "is the fact that the
  prisoner, who was sentenced to penal servitude for life, has recently made
  his escape and is at the present moment, unless he has been arrested within
  the last few days, wandering about the country, a free man."</p>

  <p>"That, I am informed, is the exact situation," Martin assented.</p>

  <p>"And may I ask, Lord Brockenhurst, what your interest is in this case or
  why you have come to see us about it?" was the somewhat shielded question
  with which Martin was faced.</p>

  <p>"You certainly may," was the equitable reply. "It's a case which I happen
  to have studied a little. I have come to the conclusion that the prisoner was
  innocent of the crime for which he was convicted."</p>

  <p>"Innocent?" Sir Frederick repeated in a tone of shocked surprise. "It is
  very seldom that a prisoner who is found guilty of a crime&mdash;for which,
  by the bye, he has already pleaded 'Guilty' and has served six years of his
  sentence&mdash;is subsequently found to have been improperly convicted."</p>

  <p>"It is a fortunate thing for the state of society at large," Martin
  rejoined, "that the occurrence to which I am alluding <i>is</i> unusual.
  However, that happens to have been so in the present case. I have come to you
  in the first place, Sir Frederick, to ask if you could tell me any
  circumstances connected with the trial which might have weighed with the
  Judge in his unusual consent to an unusual plea."</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul, no!" was the astonished reply. "How should I know
  anything about it? No, I haven't the faintest recollection of there being
  anything else in this case containing unusual circumstances. I suggested the
  change of plea to the prisoner as the only means of saving his neck, as I
  happened to know that the Judge who was trying the case had the utmost
  dislike to pronouncing the death sentence."</p>

  <p>"In plain words," Martin, who was in a grim way rather enjoying himself,
  remarked, "you want to know what on earth business it is of mine."</p>

  <p>"I should scarcely put it so bluntly," Sir Frederick agreed, "but that
  idea is at the back of my mind."</p>

  <p>"Well, I have no objection to satisfying a certain portion of your
  curiosity," Martin observed. "My father had a great liking and a great
  respect for old Simon Lebur. It is one which, I suppose, to some extent I
  inherit. Simon Lebur is a broken man through his son's conviction. He is
  slowly, at the present time, dying of grief. He, himself, is tortured with
  certain doubts. He knew that his son was not an amiable character. He knew
  that he was a young man who had been a great trouble to him all his life, but
  he didn't believe he was a man likely to have committed a murder, especially
  so cold-blooded a murder as this one seems to have been. My interest is, in a
  way, perhaps an inherited weakness. My father was greatly interested in the
  affair. He was, as you may know, a famous connoisseur of pictures himself,
  and Simon Lebur visited his gallery and collection at Brockenhurst at various
  times. We spoke on this subject some little time before he died. Although I
  can't pretend that he would ever have taken an active part in such
  investigations as I propose to set on foot, he would, I am sure, have been
  greatly interested in any possibility for the old man's closing years being
  made more happy."</p>

  <p>"What, may I ask, Lord Brockenhurst, are these investigations you propose
  to set on foot? A case settled six years ago will be a very difficult one to
  reopen&mdash;very nearly impossible."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," Martin reflected.</p>

  <p>Sir Frederick agreed enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>"Still, if there were any new evidence which came to light, the proper
  authorities would, I am sure, be disposed to investigate them thoroughly. By
  the proper authorities you will realize that I refer to the Police. It will
  give me great pleasure to give you my card, which you can present to the
  Chief Commissioner with my compliments. He will show you, I am sure, every
  attention."</p>

  <p>"That is very kind of you," Martin observed. "I was wondering, however, if
  by chance these facts came into the hands of members of the outside public
  and they brought them to you, whether you yourself would be prepared to take
  action in the matter?"</p>

  <p>Sir Frederick shook his head firmly.</p>

  <p>"A Crown case is dealt with by the Crown," he said. "Our interference
  would be regarded as unwarranted. If new evidence did arise, it would be laid
  before Scotland Yard, who, I am convinced, would at once act upon it. I am
  afraid that is all the encouragement I can give you, Lord Brockenhurst, in
  your quest."</p>

  <p>"Well," Martin reflected, "I didn't expect much beyond that. There would
  be no money in the case, would there?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever, except that, if the new evidence were of such a sort that
  the sentence was found unjustified, notwithstanding the prisoner's plea, the
  cost of his subsistence in prison for the last six years might become a
  charge upon the relatives of the falsely convicted man."</p>

  <p>Martin laughed very softly for several moments.</p>

  <p>"You think this would be rather a dangerous matter for the relatives or
  friends of the convicted man to touch, then?" he observed.</p>

  <p>"Unless they were convinced that they had absolutely fresh evidence having
  a direct bearing on the case, I should certainly advise them to leave it
  alone," was Sir Frederick's decision.</p>

  <p>"Because of the fear of involving themselves in these difficulties you
  have spoken of?" Martin enquired.</p>

  <p>The lawyer was silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I will not go so far as to say that that would be the chief object of any
  self-respecting lawyer or court," he said, "in letting things remain as they
  are. But it would have to be a consideration. In any case, it is very
  expensive to trifle with Law. I don't remember in all my experience any case
  in which good has come from such a course."</p>

  <p>Martin remained silent for some time.</p>

  <p>"Well, Sir Frederick," he said at last, "I find that I have not succeeded
  in arousing your sympathies for Richard Lebur."</p>

  <p>"May I be permitted to point out," Sir Frederick said, "that as yet you
  have not told me what this new evidence is that might have reversed the
  process of the trial if it had been made known at the time?"</p>

  <p>"Quite true, I have not," Martin replied. "I will tell you why I have not.
  This, as you have admitted, is a Crown case, and I should have to be a little
  more convinced of the proper procedure before I went any further. You see, if
  I were to place the evidence I possess, or which I think I possess, in the
  hands of the Law at the present moment, the Crown would at once, I presume,
  examine it and, if it discovered a flaw, they would not only refuse to reopen
  the case, but it would be closed for all time. Am I not right there?"</p>

  <p>"I should say you probably are," Sir Frederick admitted, after a brief
  hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Therefore," Martin continued, "unless I can interest you in the case,
  unless I can win you round to a decision to take a real interest in it and
  endeavour to secure an amendment of that false verdict, I should do very much
  better to leave you alone, and either find a lawyer who would be willing to
  work for me&mdash;I being responsible for the expenses&mdash;or drop it
  altogether."</p>

  <p>"If your evidence amounted to proof of any description," Sir Frederick
  said gruffly, "you would scarcely find a respectable firm of lawyers who
  would not appeal to the Crown to be allowed to state a case."</p>

  <p>"Still, if our opinions differ as to this evidence," Martin pursued, "I
  should be running the risk of the firm whom I had consulted wishing me 'Good
  morning' and telling me to go about my business. There are times, Sir
  Frederick, when your directness is absolutely refreshing. This is one of
  them. I see that you do not believe in my hidden evidence."</p>

  <p>"Unless I am told what it is, your Lordship, how can you expect me to
  believe in it?" Leversen persisted.</p>

  <p>Martin rose slowly to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," he said, "I am sorry to have taken up quite a good deal of
  your time to no purpose."</p>

  <p>"I hope very much," the lawyer said, "that I have convinced you of the
  folly of taking any further action in the matter."</p>

  <p>"Well, I can scarcely go as far as that," was the dubious reply. "But you
  have helped me to realize the difficulties of the situation."</p>

  <p>"If I might be permitted," Sir Frederick, concluded, "as a&mdash;I won't
  presume to say as a friend&mdash;but as a well-wisher, Lord Brockenhurst, I
  would beg you, for your own sake, to drop these vague ideas of yours at once.
  They are not likely to lead anywhere or to do you any good. In my opinion,
  Lebur was extremely fortunate in being permitted to change his plea and get
  out of court without losing his neck. I am not going to suggest for a moment
  that that leniency would be altered in any way if the case were tried again,
  but I do say that any reopening of the case would be very largely to the
  disadvantage of any hopes the man may have had of a mitigation of his
  sentence in years to come."</p>

  <p>"Very nicely put," Martin admitted. "You will forgive me, I am sure," he
  added, picking up his hat and gloves, "for having taken up so much of your
  time. I shall not, of course, intrude upon you again."</p>

  <p>Martin, with a brief nod, turned towards the door. His one idea and hope
  was to escape without being compelled to shake hands with the man whom he had
  come to visit. He kept both of his own behind his back and clutched his hat.
  His companion walked in a somewhat undignified fashion by his side.</p>

  <p>"I should not be doing my duty," Sir Frederick concluded, as they drew
  near the door, "if I didn't reiterate to you my urgent, my most impressive
  advice to leave this Lebur case alone. There is nothing to be got out of it
  which would bring you any satisfaction whatever&mdash;no benefit to the
  criminal now or in the future. Believe me, the Law has taken its course and
  it has delivered its final judgment upon the case of Richard Lebur."</p>

  <p>"You may be right," Martin admitted, looking steadily at the door handle.
  "You may, of course, be right. We shall see."</p>

  <p>The lawyer's last effort was a failure. Martin's hands were everywhere
  except in the direction of the proffered hand. At the last moment, when well
  across the threshold, he looked behind with a slight nod.</p>

  <p>"Think it over from my point of view, Sir Frederick," he advised. "There,
  you see, I am offering advice instead of taking it. Good morning, sir."</p>

  <p>The lawyer shook his head dolefully.</p>

  <p>"You are a very obstinate man, I fear, Lord Brockenhurst," he said,
  lingering wistfully on the threshold of his office.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The lady in the Battersea flat rose from her couch with much rustling of
  her skirts, a joyful smile of welcome on her lips, and outstretched hands.
  Yet it was perfectly obvious that she was not too sure who this very
  personable visitor might be.</p>

  <p>"I believe you have forgotten all about me," Martin remarked, as he
  tactfully avoided an embrace and subsided into an easy-chair by her side. She
  made a plunge and it was a successful one.</p>

  <p>"The Gigantic Hotel!"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Quite right," he admitted. "Here bothering you again. I expect you will
  be very angry with me."</p>

  <p>"If I am very angry," she said severely, "it is because you never kept
  your promise to come and see me."</p>

  <p>"But the flowers I sent you?" he reminded her.</p>

  <p>She ventured upon a little gesture which was as near scornful as she dared
  make it.</p>

  <p>"Flowers!" she exclaimed. "Well, flowers are all very well, but they never
  have very much to say to me. I like a little note inside with an invitation
  to lunch or dinner. Besides, I don't believe you sent any flowers,
  anyhow."</p>

  <p>"You might find something very much more tangible, Mrs. Culpepper," he
  assured her, "if you came into partnership with me in a little scheme I have
  on hand."</p>

  <p>She withdrew a little in her place. It was almost at the same moment that
  she smoothed down her skirts with the air of a modest lady who has discovered
  that she is showing too much leg.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to begin again?" she asked severely.</p>

  <p>"You took a wrong view of my previous enquiries," he assured her. "Things
  have changed a little since then, however. This fellow, Lebur, seems to have
  kept out of the way of the Police all this time, and, if he gets in touch
  with his father and they put their heads together, I should not wonder if
  they didn't get this case reopened. I told you that before, you know."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it," she answered obstinately. "Cases can't be tried over
  again when a verdict has been given."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose they can," Martin admitted. "But there is just one thing
  I should like to ask you, since this subject has come up&mdash;do you
  honestly believe that Richard Lebur killed Culpepper?"</p>

  <p>"Why, that's the same damn silly question you asked me before!" she
  exclaimed angrily.</p>

  <p>"Very likely," he answered. "I keep on worrying about it."</p>

  <p>"More fool you," she snapped. "You tried to frighten me the last time and
  make me believe Richard would do me a bad turn if he came across me. You
  wanted me to get out of the country, I remember. Shucks! I am not going. Once
  and for all, you had better get that into your head."</p>

  <p>"By the by, there is something else I always wanted to ask you," he went
  on. "Was it you who tried my door, then knocked on the panelling, and then
  rang me up on the telephone that night we talked together at the Gigantic
  Hotel?"</p>

  <p>She laughed at him.</p>

  <p>"You are a bad man," she exclaimed coyly. "As if I should do such a
  thing!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I was never quite sure," he meditated.</p>

  <p>"Well, you come down to the Gigantic Hotel this week-end and see what
  happens to you," she suggested.</p>

  <p>"My dear lady, I daren't," he assured her. "You see, I have become engaged
  to be married since the last time we met."</p>

  <p>"More fool you," she replied. "I can't think what you men get married for.
  Aren't there plenty of nice-looking women about in the world you can have a
  spot of fun with if you want to, without tying yourself up for life?"</p>

  <p>"That certainly is one way of looking at it," he admitted. "But listen! I
  am going to ask you one more question and then we will talk about lighter
  things."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I have gone on with my enquiries since we met last," he told her, "and I
  have found out one thing. There was another person that afternoon who could
  have killed Culpepper."</p>

  <p>He sat watching her and what he saw was illuminating. He saw every scrap
  of colour drain from her cheeks. The last time he had even hinted at such a
  thing, she had scoffed at it. This time, it had thrown her into a cold agony
  of terror.</p>

  <p>"Anyone else in my flat that day!" she gasped. "It's a lie! There was no
  one&mdash;there could have been no one!"</p>

  <p>"So we all thought," he answered. "We know differently now. There was
  someone, Mrs. Culpepper. Blast the woman!" he added, gazing at her ruefully.
  "Here, sit up! You can't faint here."</p>

  <p>She stretched out her hand.</p>

  <p>"H&eacute;l&egrave;ne! H&eacute;l&egrave;ne!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>He rang the bell, then came back to her side and held a tumbler of water
  to her lips. She spat out the liquid and aimed a wild blow at Martin. Then,
  to his immense relief, the door was softly opened and the girl who had sat at
  the table with her at the Gigantic Hotel glided into the room. She closed the
  door and crossed the floor towards them.</p>

  <p>"The same man," she murmured deprecatingly. "Why are you always upsetting
  this poor woman? You did it once before in the hotel. The idea of offering
  her water, too!"</p>

  <p>The girl crossed the room to the sideboard, brought out a decanter of
  brandy and filled a wineglass. She laid her hand on the woman's forehead,
  pushed her head a little back and held the glass to her lips. The woman drank
  it eagerly. She struggled a little higher in her seat, but she was still in a
  semicomatose state.</p>

  <p>"This man will kill me," she exclaimed. "Do you know what he says,
  H&eacute;l&egrave;ne? He tells me there was another man in the flat the day
  Culpepper was murdered!"</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle H&eacute;l&egrave;ne appeared unaffected.</p>

  <p>"What are you?" she asked, looking curiously at Martin. "A
  detective&mdash;that you keep worrying this poor woman? What if there was
  another man? No one saw him, if there was. The case is all over and finished
  with. Why are you trying all the time to rake things up?"</p>

  <p>"I belong to a little company of one or two men who think there may have
  been a mistake," he confided. "You see, the man who was found guilty is
  serving a sentence of penal servitude at Dartmoor, and he doesn't like it. He
  is free now temporarily and he wants to know if something can't be done about
  it. That is why I came to try to persuade Mrs. Culpepper to tell me the
  truth."</p>

  <p>"Too late for anything of that sort, I'm afraid," the girl said brusquely.
  "The case is over and done with. Go away now, please, sir. You see what a
  state you have thrown this poor woman into. She is going to faint again in a
  minute."</p>

  <p>Martin rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are right," he acknowledged. "I will leave you to look after
  her. I think I have found out the most important thing I wanted to know. Were
  you there that day?"</p>

  <p>"I was a witness," she replied calmly.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that anything was left out that should have been told?"</p>

  <p>"You can't ask questions like that when that poor woman's lying there half
  listening," the girl rejoined angrily.</p>

  <p>He tore an envelope from a letter in his pocket and scribbled a few words
  on it.</p>

  <p>"Just for the moment," he said a little brutally, "I don't think that
  Madame is listening. I was only guessing before. I have convinced myself now
  that there was or had been someone else in Madame's flat. If at any time you
  should feel like earning a thousand pounds, you can come and tell me his name
  or how to find it out."</p>

  <p>Whereupon Martin bowed to the fainting woman, smiled at the girl, who was
  standing with the envelope in her hand, picked up his hat and stick and took
  his departure, feeling just about as ashamed of himself as he had ever felt
  before in his life.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

  <p>Simon Lebur was brooding over a volume of engravings, which he had bought
  at Christie's a few days before, when Martin was shown into his office next
  afternoon. He laid it down on the table with a gesture of relief.</p>

  <p>"News?" he demanded with a little gasp.</p>

  <p>"No news," Martin replied. "No news, except that I am daily losing a
  little more self-respect, Simon, in this matter."</p>

  <p>Simon's two hands were crossed on the ivory knob of his stick. They
  trembled for several moments before he spoke.</p>

  <p>"If there's a man in this city who can afford to walk with his head in the
  air all day and every day, it is you, my friend," he groaned. "Why do you
  have these nervous fits? You have not a thought in your mind that is not for
  others. There is not an action of which you are ever guilty which is not for
  the good of others. The desire of your own heart stays there, unchanging, as
  I know, and yet you speak of self-shame."</p>

  <p>Martin patted him on the shoulder as he passed him and threw himself into
  the easy-chair opposite.</p>

  <p>"It is the rotten way I am going about things, Simon, my friend," he
  confessed. "Yesterday I called on a bad woman and I tried to frighten her
  into telling me something I very much want to know. I frightened her into a
  faint and, while she lay in her chair, unconscious, I offered her companion a
  thousand pounds to tell me the same thing&mdash;not before her face, mind,
  but while her mistress was fainting."</p>

  <p>Simon waved a tremulous hand in the air.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," he faltered. "I don't believe that even now, in
  these evil days, Richard would tell me a lie. He has told me that he has sent
  you papers which make it possible for you to marry Pamela at any moment,
  whether he is alive, or dead, or in prison."</p>

  <p>"He has done that," Martin assented. "From his point of view it was the
  deed of an honest man, and he did it unasked, without even a suggestion from
  me."</p>

  <p>"Then why is your face dark with trouble?" Simon asked sadly. "If you love
  this woman so much&mdash;and I know that you do love her and I know that I
  love her myself; she is one of the happy people of the world because she is
  good&mdash;what then is wrong with you, Martin?"</p>

  <p>"Something that your son never thought of," Martin replied. "Something, to
  tell you the truth, that I never thought of, but something which makes those
  papers only a mockery. They are the papers which would give a divorce to any
  woman who possessed them, but, alas, he forgot and I forgot and you forget
  that Pamela's people from far back in the past are all zealous Roman
  Catholics."</p>

  <p>"God!" Simon muttered to himself, hoarsely. "She would let that stand in
  the way?"</p>

  <p>Martin was very nearly angry.</p>

  <p>"Simon," he said, "you are a Jew and you are an honest, self-respecting
  Jew. You follow your faith to its farthest limit. You know perfectly well
  that, if your creed forbade divorce, you would feel exactly as Pamela
  does."</p>

  <p>"You have not asked her, then?"</p>

  <p>"I shall never ask her&mdash;which means, perhaps, that I shall never
  marry her. But she knows."</p>

  <p>"Why have you come to tell me this now, just now?" Simon Lebur asked.</p>

  <p>"Because I am a coward," Martin confessed. "I am carrying with me the
  seeds of a disappointment so great that I can't bear them alone. I have to
  come whining to others for sympathy. No good saying I'm sorry, Simon.
  Tomorrow I shall be even more ashamed than I am today. I have been working
  desperately to find out if an old conviction of mine was not the truth, to
  gather proof, if possible, that it was not your boy who murdered Culpepper.
  Your heart was full of gratitude to me for this. I didn't deserve it, Simon.
  I was working more for my own sake. I have known for days now that it is the
  only chance I have in life. While he lives, Pamela can be nothing more to me
  than she is now&mdash;my dearest and most wonderful friend. That is my
  decision&mdash;not hers. I should be none the better off if we succeeded in
  proving Richard innocent tomorrow. Nevertheless, I can't escape from the
  conviction that he is innocent. I want to prove it for your sake and, in a
  sense, for hers. For myself, I have little&mdash;I have nothing&mdash;to hope
  for."</p>

  <p>Simon's face was hidden in his hands. Martin sprang up and hurried to his
  side, sat on the arm of his chair and passed his arm round the old man's
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Simon," he went on, "this is no fault of yours. Other men have had worse
  troubles than mine, for I can see Pamela all the time. I shall count her as I
  do now&mdash;my dearest friend. It is just the strange way events have worked
  out!"</p>

  <p>"It is a cruel thing," Simon said, with a little break in his voice, "that
  you, who deserve so much, should gain so little. You, who should be so happy,
  must pass through life a lonely man. And my son&mdash;yes, I must use the
  words&mdash;my son, Martin, if by any chance he gets free through your
  efforts or anyone else's efforts, he will walk in the mud all his days. He
  will never have the courage, never have the grace or the will to raise his
  head and realize what the great God gave him and has now taken away. You are
  content, Martin, to think that while you are alive and your love is there,
  and her love for you is there&mdash;you are content, for the sake of these
  strange scruples, to let her pass away out of your love and keeping for
  ever?"</p>

  <p>"I speak for Pamela, Simon," Martin answered. "If you were Pamela and her
  creed were your creed, you would feel as she feels."</p>

  <p>Simon's worn hands once more covered his face.</p>

  <p>"The God of Abraham only knows," he murmured sadly.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Martin left his old friend with a kindly grip of the hand but with a queer
  sense of estrangement. He went to Pamela's studio and, curiously enough, he
  felt a sense of repose and almost contentment in lying quite silently in a
  low chair and watching her work. Very few words passed between them. They had
  reached that stage in their joint life when existence flowed on, without
  explanation, without any need for it. Every now and then she looked away from
  her work and across at him&mdash;looked steadfastly into his eyes, without
  speech or questioning. For the first few times he carried out his methods of
  helping her when she was troubled by some difficulties of details, and held
  up before her a rough charcoal sketch of Simon&mdash;a sketch which had
  formed the basis of her picture. As time passed on, however, she shook her
  head. He understood at once and leant the picture against the wall. He let
  her eyes wander towards him, watched a contemplative gleam in them, remained
  speechless, but made no effort to help her. There came a time when he saw the
  little tide of weariness which came to her now and then, and at last she laid
  down her brush.</p>

  <p>"It is enough for today," she sighed. "I must sit by your side, Martin. My
  fingers are cramped and I am brain-weary. Is there any news?"</p>

  <p>"None."</p>

  <p>"You have seen the woman?"</p>

  <p>"I have. She has nothing to tell me. To offer her money would be foolish,
  for she has no need of it. But I have been low enough to try to bribe her
  companion. I have offered a thousand pounds for the name of the man who did
  shoot Culpepper. Richard, himself, is innocent, to that I will swear. But
  there is nothing that even he can suggest. I believe that at the back of his
  mind he is convinced, although he would never admit it, that it was she
  herself who is guilty. He believes that it is she whom he is shielding."</p>

  <p>She looked at him curiously. To her this had long ago become a foregone
  conclusion.</p>

  <p>"Tell me one thing more, Martin," she begged, "before we leave this
  horrible subject alone, for a time, at any rate. Why would you swear that
  Richard is innocent? Why do you believe it? No one else does."</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure about that, dear," he answered. "There is another man, a
  hard-headed, shrewd servant of the Police, who also believes it. Why should
  we both have the same idea? The strange thing about it all, too, is that at
  the back of my mind I find it quite unimportant, except for the sake of that
  poor old man. I should not have the slightest objection to marrying the wife
  of a murderer&mdash;it would not affect your willingness to marry me. But
  there is just one thing that keeps you and me apart and, in a sense, will
  keep us apart for ever."</p>

  <p>"You mean?"</p>

  <p>"That the ceremony, which would remain always to us a sacrament, would be
  really a sham. You know what it was my father in his last years prayed for,
  and what he believed had become a certainty. He died with that smile upon his
  lips, Pamela, which neither of us could ever forget. We have to be true to
  the promise which brought it there."</p>

  <p>She looked at him and he saw again that quick rise and fall of her bosom.
  He saw the strange fire blaze out for a moment and then depart from those
  strangely beautiful eyes.</p>

  <p>"Martin!"</p>

  <p>He took her hand. She drew willingly and joyfully a little nearer to him.
  She laid her head upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I will not say that I am content," he whispered. "But I have never
  complained. I shall never complain. My love for you is a thing quite apart
  from my dreams of possession."</p>

  <p>Her lips touched his and it seemed to him there was almost a sacerdotal
  fire in them.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you too feel like that, Martin?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Certainly. I ought not&mdash;and I should not if I didn't love you almost
  to agony," he answered, smoothing back her hair. "Those passion-torn
  ancestors of ours wouldn't understand it, I suppose. I don't understand it
  myself some days, some hours, but there it is."</p>

  <p>It seemed to him that his heart had suddenly missed a beat. There was no
  strange presence in the room, only that hideous, mechanical disturbance
  caused by the soft purring of the telephone. He kissed her eyes, but when he
  would have drawn away, she pulled him closer to her.</p>

  <p>"Let's have finished with the rest of the world, Martin," she begged. "We
  talk too much to other people. We wear ourselves out too much with strange
  thoughts and fancies. Stay here with me. Sit the twilight out with me. Those
  great green leaves flapping upon the window-pane are the leaves from the
  olive trees in my garden, and that is no city you catch glimpses of beyond.
  We are passing out of that world, Martin. I want to take you somewhere else.
  You will come?"</p>

  <p>There was the perfume of the magnolia in the uneven billows of her hair
  and the fire of the scarlet flowers of Florence in her almost fierce caress.
  He drew her closer and closer into his embrace&mdash;and the time came when
  the telephone ceased to ring.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Yet in the end the loathsome thing prevailed, for on a third fresh attempt
  Martin took up the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" was the somewhat surly reply.</p>

  <p>"3098 Chelsea."</p>

  <p>"There is a long-distance call for Lord Brockenhurst," replied the
  operator.</p>

  <p>"I am Lord Brockenhurst," Martin answered.</p>

  <p>Almost at once Richard Lebur's voice came down the line. There seemed to
  be no attempt at concealment, but the voice itself sounded strange.</p>

  <p>"Brockenhurst?"</p>

  <p>"Speaking."</p>

  <p>"Hold on to your head. I have news to tell you."</p>

  <p>"Go on."</p>

  <p>"Your thousand pounds did the trick. You won't fail?"</p>

  <p>"How fail?" Martin demanded.</p>

  <p>"The girl&mdash;she wants her thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"She shall have it," Martin promised. "Send her round to me now, if you
  will."</p>

  <p>"I'll send her straightaway," was the husky reply. "She'll be with you in
  an hour or so. Somehow, I fancy that you have spent your money wisely,
  Brockenhurst. Somehow, I fancy you will say that you have received good value
  for it."</p>

  <p>"Why can't you tell me all about it?"</p>

  <p>There was a queer little laugh.</p>

  <p>"My dear man, I have written it down&mdash;two or three clear words, two
  or three clear paragraphs. Quite a little story! Read it carefully. The girl
  is bringing it to you. If I have forgotten anything, she will tell you."</p>

  <p>"I don't wish anyone to come here," Martin complained. "As you know, I am
  in your wife's studio."</p>

  <p>"Then, keep my wife away from it, if you can. But read the letter the girl
  brings you. Give her the money you promised and accept my best wishes."</p>

  <p>After that&mdash;silence.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The bell of the outside door was ringing. With fierce unwillingness Martin
  slipped back the latch. Standing at his full height, he blocked the whole of
  the threshold. There before him was the girl he had first seen at the
  Gigantic Hotel&mdash;Mrs. Culpepper's companion. She was dressed in the same
  sombre gown; those two front teeth seemed more than ever prominent, her
  complexion was bad, her expression sullenly and stoically indifferent.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" Martin asked.</p>

  <p>She looked at him indifferently.</p>

  <p>"I come with a message for you," she said.</p>

  <p>"No one," Martin told her, "can enter this room for the moment."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"I have no reason to give you," he replied. "If you have a message, give
  it to me. If you have a letter, I will read it, but you cannot enter this
  room."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you wouldn't mind," she asked sarcastically, "coming with me into
  the street and sitting in my taxi-cab."</p>

  <p>"I will do that," he agreed with great relief.</p>

  <p>He stepped outside, felt in his pocket to be sure that the key was there,
  and closed the door behind him. They descended the staircase into the street.
  He handed her into the taxi. She took her place in it, looking at him
  curiously all the time.</p>

  <p>"You aren't very hospitable," she said.</p>

  <p>"That is not my home," he explained, "and you have come at a moment when I
  have no hospitality to offer."</p>

  <p>"Do I sit here, then, and tell you what I have to say?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you must," he replied.</p>

  <p>"You offered a thousand pounds for the name of the man who shot David
  Culpepper."</p>

  <p>"I did. You shall have the money as soon as you tell me."</p>

  <p>"You will trust my word?"</p>

  <p>"I will."</p>

  <p>"Then I will trust yours. The name is contained in the letter which I am
  going to hand to you together with one from Richard Lebur."</p>

  <p>"Where is Richard Lebur?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The girl smiled. It was not a pleasant gesture. On the other hand, it was
  inoffensive.</p>

  <p>"Richard Lebur for the last five days has been engaged in the purchase of
  a passport," she confided. "He has secured it for himself and his wife. He
  was married to the lady who has been known as Mrs. Culpepper at St. Martin's
  Registry Office a few days ago. They left by plane at four o'clock this
  afternoon. They are well away by now on their journey&mdash;abroad."</p>

  <p>"A little sudden, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"It seemed so to me," the girl assented, "but the woman couldn't get her
  passport without it. Anyway, they have gone, and, as soon as I have collected
  your thousand pounds, I shall be off, if they will let me."</p>

  <p>"Who are 'they?'" Martin asked.</p>

  <p>"The Police. I don't know whether they are going to interfere. I began to
  wonder, myself, whether they were not helping Richard Lebur. I saw them off
  and there wasn't a question asked. They have gone and I am damn well glad.
  Here's the letter."</p>

  <p>Martin took it into his hands. He slit open the envelope and stared with
  set, fixed eyes and blank incredulity at the name scrawled out across half a
  sheet of notepaper. The letter itself fluttered down to his feet, but the
  girl retrieved it. She picked it up and handed it to him.</p>

  <p>"This envelope," she said, "is from Richard Lebur. I know nothing about
  it. He gave me a little farewell present to come and place it in your hands.
  There's a document of some sort inside. Before you read it, there's something
  else. There's a letter, too, from Richard Lebur. I'm not charging anything
  for delivery, but&mdash;he seemed to think you'd be glad to have it."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand, tore open the long mauve envelope, and found himself
  staring with ever-increasing astonishment at the oblong slip of printed
  words.</p>

  <p>"Bit slow, aren't you?" she scoffed. "Never saw one before, I suppose.
  I'll tell you what it is, it's a marriage certificate, that's what it is. He
  wasn't over-keen on parting with it, I can tell you!"</p>

  <p>Martin heard nothing. He was staring with fascinated eyes at that slip of
  paper. A marriage certificate it certainly was, and the name of the man was
  Richard Lebur, and the girl Gladys Somerly of the King's Arms Hotel,
  Cambridge, and the marriage between these two had been solemnized nine years
  ago at St. Mary's Church, Wisbech. A crumpled-up note was pinned on to the
  certificate. He straightened it out and read:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">You take some satisfying, M. B., you and the fine finicky
  lady, but this will do the trick for you. The girl was a barmaid of the
  King's Arms. She died three years ago, but she was very much alive and
  kicking on the day I married Pamela, as anyone in Cambridge would tell you!
  Help yourself, my friend. Since divorce won't do, I am sending you the proof
  that I had another wife the day I married Pamela Orsini. Sarah and I are off
  to S.A. If ever I come back, I'll perhaps tell you who killed David
  Culpepper. Sarah knows, for all her basketful of lies. Satisfied, I hope.</p>

  <p class="letter">R. L.</p><br>

  <p>He folded up the scrap of paper and placed it in his waistcoat pocket.</p>

  <p>"You have earned your money," he said to the girl.</p>

  <p>"I know that," she replied. "I'm waiting here for it, aren't I?"</p>

  <p>"You shall be paid at once," he promised, "but be reasonable. I have
  plenty of money at home, in the bank, in my rooms, anywhere I choose to go
  for it, but the one place where I have not got a spare thousand pounds is in
  my pocket."</p>

  <p>"More fool you, if you had!" she replied.</p>

  <p>He meditated for a minute.</p>

  <p>"Would you have any objection to driving with me round to my rooms? They
  are not very far away. I suppose a cheque will do for a portion of it?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him for a moment, curiously.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she agreed. "You are honest enough. A bit of a fool, you must be,
  or you would have dealt with this matter differently. What are you going to
  do about the thousand pounds&mdash;meet me tomorrow somewhere?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he answered. "I shan't keep you waiting nearly as long as
  that. If you will sit here quietly in this taxi until I have run up those
  steps and left a note to explain my absence, I will return within five
  minutes. You shall drive with me to my rooms, and I think I can safely
  promise you the whole of your thousand pounds. If I am a trifle short, I
  shall give you a cheque for the balance."</p>

  <p>"I am satisfied," she answered. "Hurry up!"</p>

  <p>He ran lightly up the stairs, turned the key, which he was holding in his
  hand, in the door, and sat down by Pamela's writing-table. He scrawled less
  than half a dozen lines and no human being but Pamela herself ever saw them.
  He addressed them to her, rang the bell, and waited. The maid came almost at
  once. He pointed to the note.</p>

  <p>"See that your mistress has that immediately," he directed. "Tell her, if
  you please, that I shall be back before very long."</p>

  <p>The maid took the note from his fingers. Once more he went down the
  stairs, gave his address to the cab-driver, and drove off.</p>

  <p>"You have started by being well up to time," the young woman remarked,
  with an attempt at cheerfulness. "Keep it up, please."</p>

  <p>"You are in a hurry to get back?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"So would you be in a hurry to break off altogether with that wretched
  woman and that madman, if you had been hanging about after them for the last
  few weeks."</p>

  <p>"I may ask you one more question," he begged, as they turned into
  Piccadilly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, for God's sake, get it off your chest, then!" the girl snapped.</p>

  <p>"Here you are, then&mdash;does Richard Lebur know who your mistress's
  other visitor was upon that afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"Not he!" she answered scornfully. "He's fool enough to believe that she
  never had any other visitors except himself."</p>

  <p>They drove on in silence. She followed him to his rooms. He ordered a
  whisky and soda from Janien, but he left it untouched when it appeared.</p>

  <p>"Don't disturb me again until I ring, Janien," he directed.</p>

  <p>The man took his departure. The girl watched him curiously.</p>

  <p>"My! He's a quiet one, isn't he?" she remarked.</p>

  <p>"Well-trained servant," was the terse reply. "Sit down in that easy-chair,
  please."</p>

  <p>He pointed to one a short distance away. She seated herself a little
  awkwardly.</p>

  <p>He dealt with the safe quickly enough. The heavy door swung open. He
  brought out a large cash-box, a pocket-book, and a bundle of notes, and he
  relocked the safe. For ten minutes he was counting. The girl sat watching
  him, fascinated. When he had reached the end of the first hundred, she leaned
  across the table.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe it's real money," she muttered. "Give me that to be going
  on with."</p>

  <p>"One hundred," he said. "All right! Take it, young lady. And here's the
  second," he added, very soon afterwards. "Two hundred."</p>

  <p>Up to eight hundred all went smoothly. There was still some left. He
  turned to the pocket-book, counted out ten ten-pound notes, and twenty fives.
  He pushed them across the table and threw after them the rubber band in which
  the last lot had been enclosed.</p>

  <p>"A thousand pounds," he pointed out.</p>

  <p>"That's right," she assented in a hushed tone. "My God! One thousand
  pounds!"</p>

  <p>He handed her another ten-pound note.</p>

  <p>"That's for the answer to the question I asked you in the taxi-cab," he
  said. "Now, here's another ten-pound note coming for the last question of
  all. What are they going to do, those two?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "That is no concern of mine," she answered. "It was no
  part of the bargain that I should tell you that, even if I knew it."</p>

  <p>"Quite right," he admitted. "I don't press it. They are off the map, both
  of them, so far as I am concerned."</p>

  <p>"And me," the girl said, rising eagerly to her feet. "I shall leave you to
  pay the taxi, sir."</p>

  <p>"I will accept the responsibility," he agreed. "Tell me&mdash;how are you
  going to spend your money?"</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't believe me if I told you," she answered.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe I should," he admitted.</p>

  <p>He rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"Show this young lady out, Janien," he said. "Tell the taxi to wait."</p>

  <p>Janien threw open the door. She looked back past him to his master.</p>

  <p>"I hope you will get your thousand pounds' worth, sir," she remarked with
  a sneer.</p>

  <p>"Maybe," he answered enigmatically, his fingers feeling the crumpled-up
  slip of paper in his waistcoat pocket.</p>

  <p>Janien, as soon as he had closed the door, reappeared. He was carrying a
  salver in his hand. Upon it reposed a large square envelope.</p>

  <p>"This has just been left for your Lordship," he announced. "I was begged
  to see that you had it without delay. There is also a note there which came
  at the same time from Lady Diana Malladene." Martin signed towards the
  window. Janien hurried across the room and threw it up.</p>

  <p>"Hand me my whisky and soda, Janien," he ordered, as he sank into a
  chair.</p>

  <p>The man obeyed swiftly. He also brought cigarettes and matches, which he
  placed upon the table. Martin ignored the letter, but he gulped off the
  contents of the tumbler. He then opened the square, fine envelope with the
  coronet, addressed to him in an unfamiliar hand. He spread out the letter. It
  was dated that morning from Malladene House.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">The Earl of Malladene requests the company of Lord
  Brockenhurst at 8:15 this evening, September 17th, to a Mystery Dinner to be
  held at the above address. Short coats and black ties.</p><br>

  <p>There was a little note in the corner:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My dear Martin</span>,</p>

  <p class="letter">I beg, as a compliment to an elderly friend and as a great
  favour, that you will not fail him.</p><br>

  <p>Martin finished his whisky and soda and tore open the note, the
  handwriting of which was quite familiar. It was also dated from Malladene
  House.</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Martin darling</span>,</p>

  <p class="letter">Do be an angel and, whatever you are doing, put it off, and
  come to Father's funny dinner tonight. I don't know who the guests are,
  except that I am not one, but Lionel, who has just arrived, will be there,
  and it seems to me to be connected with some family business with which you
  are concerned.</p>

  <p class="letter">Your dear little accountant has been most encouraging, and
  I have promised him a few shares for himself if the company scheme should
  come off. Really, I had no idea that on good nights we were making so much
  money.</p>

  <p class="letter">Ever yours affectionately,<br>
  <span class="smcap">Diana</span></p><br>

  <p>Martin moved over to his desk and scribbled off two notes, the first a
  formal acceptance of Lord Malladene's invitation, the second a line to
  Diana.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">My dear, [he wrote] of course I shall come. Expect me at
  8:15 to the moment. I want particularly to see you afterwards if possible.
  <span class="smcap">Martin.</span></p><br>

  <p>He rang the bell for Janien, dispatched the two notes by urgent messenger,
  and drove slowly back to Chelsea. Pamela, who let him in, was shocked at his
  appearance.</p>

  <p>"Martin!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>He forced a smile, sat down by her side on the divan, and caressed her
  hand.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he said, "I am a stricken man. I can't dine with you
  tonight."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" she asked breathlessly.</p>

  <p>He still held her hand.</p>

  <p>"For the first time in my life," he confided, "I am going to keep a secret
  from you, Pamela."</p>

  <p>"For how long?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Until, I should think, somewhere between ten and eleven," he answered.
  "About that time I shall be here."</p>

  <p>She gave a queer little cry which reminded him somehow or other of a hurt
  or frightened bird in a foreign country.</p>

  <p>"It is something very terrible that has happened?" she faltered.</p>

  <p>His fingers clasping hers were full of reassurance.</p>

  <p>"It is just one of those shocks that come to us sometimes in life," he
  confided. "I have been rather stupid about it, Pamela. There is nothing which
  you need fear. There is nothing which will make the least difference to you
  or to me. I shall be with you again perhaps before you have finished your
  coffee, and I think when I come you will be glad."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

  <p>The Right Honourable Phillip, Earl of Malladene, Supreme Judge of His
  Majesty's Courts of Justice, received his guests at the function to which he
  had humorously alluded as his "Mystery Dinner" in an attitude of pleasant and
  gentle dignity.</p>

  <p>He was standing a few yards inside the palatial octagonal dining-room of
  Malladene House: one of the few great mansions which has preserved its
  ancient splendour through a stormy period of many divergent influences.</p>

  <p>The rumours&mdash;and there had been many&mdash;of the decaying fortunes
  of the House of Malladene were ill-supported by the finely cut glass, the
  pile of exotic flowers upon the table, and the Old Masters still hanging upon
  the walls. On that memorable night the whole atmosphere seemed to be one of
  wealth, prosperity, and success. Yet, among the household itself, there was a
  queer sensation of ill-being. Lady Diana, one of the lightest-hearted of
  young women, having searched in vain for her father in his own rooms, and
  discovering from Sinclair, the family butler, that he was already in the
  dining-room, took her courage into her hands and went in search of him,
  regardless of his frown of displeasure when she entered.</p>

  <p>Diana went up to her father, thrust her arm through his, and led him out
  of the room into her own little boudoir on the other side of the hall.</p>

  <p>"Dad, we're worried about this dinner," she confided bluntly.</p>

  <p>He looked at her smiling.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth, my dear," he confessed, "so am I."</p>

  <p>"Why are you giving it, then?" she asked, "and to all these strange
  people?"</p>

  <p>He swung his monocle gently for a moment by its cord.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember a caricature of me years ago in <i>Vanity Fair</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I do," she replied with a trace of irritation in her manner.
  "What on earth has that to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, the man who wrote the little appreciation spoke of what he called
  'traces of Puck-like humour' sometimes detectable in my decisions given from
  the Bench and, later on, from a more dignified position. He was perhaps
  right, Diana. I think that I sometimes feel the urge of a queer desire to do
  something entirely at variance with what the world is expecting. It is owing
  to a swift and unexpected impulse of this sort that I wrote out those
  invitations&mdash;that I am giving my dinner tonight."</p>

  <p>"But, father, what is it leading to?" she demanded. "So far as I can
  remember, you have never invited that awful lawyer to sit at your table
  before. What common interests could there be, say, between him and Martin
  Brockenhurst? And then, old Simon Lebur? What in the name of all that is
  amazing made you invite that dear old man to what you can only call a cranky
  dinner?"</p>

  <p>Lord Malladene glanced at his wrist-watch for a moment, took out his
  cigarette-case, passed it to his daughter, and himself lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"What," he asked, "is your favourite cocktail, Diana? You so seldom dine
  at home that I have forgotten."</p>

  <p>"White Lady," she answered.</p>

  <p>He pointed towards the bell. She understood and gave an order to the
  answering footman. In a few minutes Sinclair entered the room with a small
  cocktail shaker and two glasses, which he filled and served.</p>

  <p>Lord Malladene waved him away.</p>

  <p>"Show my guests, when they arrive, into the library, Sinclair," he
  ordered. "As soon as I have finished with Lady Diana, I will ring, and you
  can take them into the dining-room."</p>

  <p>"Very good, your Lordship."</p>

  <p>Malladene raised his glass.</p>

  <p>"It pleases me very much, Diana," he said, "to have this little drink with
  you. If we had time, I would discuss my scheme for this evening; there are
  points about it which I think might appeal to you. As, however, the hour of
  eight is already striking, and my guests will be here almost at once, there
  is nothing more to be said, except that you need not worry about this
  somewhat unusual function which is about to take place. It will settle a
  question which has given me a great deal of uneasiness during the last few
  months. It may cause a certain amount of gossip&mdash;never mind. The gossip
  will die out&mdash;some other man will have a strange idea tomorrow, and the
  world will easily forget."</p>

  <p>He raised his glass; his fingers were perfectly steady; it was the girl
  alone who was still uneasy and troubled. Even whilst she was trying to frame
  one more question, she felt him stoop over her for a moment, felt the touch
  of his lips, saw a little glint in his eyes which seemed to be expressing
  something terribly like a farewell; and then she was alone, and the door-bell
  was ringing below, and something told her that whatever was to happen could
  be stayed by nothing she might say nor any question she might ask. It was
  with a sinking heart that she listened to her father's retreating
  footsteps.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The little company of guests seemed to arrive almost in a body. Their
  attitude towards the feast itself, and their host, so far as one could gather
  from their whispered conversation, differed amazingly. Sinclair, the old
  butler, himself perplexed and anxious, took special care to betray no signs
  of surprise or discomfiture. This "Mystery Dinner," as he had heard it
  called, was a whim of his master to celebrate his sixty-sixth birthday. All
  ladies were banished from the house; an unusual quantity of wine had been
  requisitioned from the cellars; and it was perfectly clear that more than
  half of the guests who were shown into that library were thoroughly
  uncomfortable and ill at ease.</p>

  <p>Martin Brockenhurst was the only one of whom Sinclair wholly approved. On
  the few occasions when Lord Malladene had given what he called a "stag
  dinner," the men had all been of gentle birth, in his own position in life.
  What Sinclair thought of the present assembly was completely hidden behind
  his set features. It was Lord Malladene himself who, after his guests had
  been ushered in from the library, and duly greeted, placed them at table,
  and, where necessary, murmured a few words of introduction.</p>

  <p>"Martin," he said with a little wave of the hand, "opposite to me, please.
  Sinclair is holding your chair. Mr. Simon Lebur will sit at your right, and
  our pillar of the Law, Sir Frederick Leversen, at your left. The new
  Sub-Commissioner, Sir James Charlesworth, on my right, please, next to my
  son, Lionel. We shall have to drink your health later, Charlesworth, and
  congratulate you upon your new dignity."</p>

  <p>Malladene paused for a moment while the soup was being served and the
  sherry handed round. He seemed to be taking note of his guests one by one,
  assuring himself that there were no absentees. Satisfied at last, he raised
  his glass, and the fine rigidity of his features lapsed into a kindly
  welcoming smile in which a close observer might have detected a very faint
  gleam of humour.</p>

  <p>"My guests," he said, and the familiar roll of his voice had never been
  more pronounced, "I drink your health and bid you welcome. The sherry I offer
  you is my excuse for my lifelong abstinence from cocktails. A toast before
  dinner is, I know, exceptional, but I think, before we proceed any further,
  we should offer our congratulations to the new Sub-Commissioner of Scotland
  Yard, Sir James Charlesworth."</p>

  <p>They all drained their glasses. Charlesworth returned thanks with one
  all-embracing bow. There was not a single person there, however, who was
  wholly at his ease, although they were all making a valiant attempt at
  bluff.</p>

  <p>"A glorious wine," Lionel Malladene declared as he drained the contents of
  his glass. "It would have saved thousands of livers in India if we had been
  able to get it."</p>

  <p>"I believe, Lionel," his father replied, as he settled down in his
  beautifully-carved chair, "curiously enough, this particular brand of sherry
  travels badly."</p>

  <p>"We would, nevertheless, have given a great deal for a wine like this in
  our office mess, sir," his son remarked. "Sherry has what I call a 'double
  temperature.' It is just as good in the hot weather as in the rains."</p>

  <p>The subject of wine kept the conversation flowing along smoothly. After
  the first few minutes, however, the talk needed little artificial stimulus.
  The host saw to that with complete success. He possessed a rich store of
  legal anecdotes; and with unfailing memory he kept the table in a continual
  ripple of amusement. The preliminary embarrassment upon the coming together
  of an ill-assorted company soon faded away. The Sub-Commissioner turned to
  his neighbour with a little whisper of admiration.</p>

  <p>"Your father is amazing, Mr. Malladene," he remarked. "You must be
  delighted to find him in such good form; he looks like a young man; he has
  the air of one, and his memory is miraculous!"</p>

  <p>"If it were not that your Lordship is much too young in years," Sir
  Frederick Leversen said in his thin, squeaky voice, "one feels that you
  should write your memoirs at once whilst your brain is so active."</p>

  <p>There was a curious smile upon Malladene's lips as he bowed slightly
  towards the speaker.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure if yours is good advice, Sir Frederick," he said; "perhaps
  it would be better for me to wait a little longer until my brain is a little
  less active and my memory less far-reaching. There are times, you know, when
  one remembers too much!"</p>

  <p>Sir Frederick's lips were momentarily indrawn&mdash;he commenced a remark
  which he never finished; the brief silence which followed seemed to have in
  it the qualities of an impending thunderstorm. The host of the party,
  however, restored the situation.</p>

  <p>"You are all flattering me disgracefully," he declared; "still, perhaps if
  I continue to feel like it," he added, a queer little smile twitching the
  corners of his lips, "I may venture to anticipate to the extent of a single
  leaf out of a day of my life, a little later on. It contains an incident
  which may interest you. It will afford me a certain amount of relief to take
  you into my confidence."</p>

  <p>Even then, perhaps, Martin Brockenhurst was the only person in the room
  who sensed a glimmering of the threatened thunderstorm. The little murmur of
  interest at their host's words was only conventional; an incident out of the
  mass of experience which would be used later for publication could scarcely
  be of supreme importance. The uneasiness in Martin's mind, however, grew; it
  seemed to him he was beginning to understand the meaning of this party, and
  the end to which it was moving. If his idea had anything of truth in it,
  there was drama in its most hideous shape to come.</p>

  <p>"I myself decline to be a listener," he said as lightly as possible, "even
  though our host's description were to be that of the Recording Angel himself.
  I dislike to be told of events out of their sequence."</p>

  <p>Thunder was muttering again. Nearly everyone felt Martin had, in a sense,
  thrown down a challenge to their host. Something was to happen!</p>

  <p>"What is it all about?" Lionel whispered to his neighbour. "The Governor
  looks as though he had something on his mind, and I never saw Martin
  Brockenhurst look so much like a man who meant to make himself
  unpleasant."</p>

  <p>"Let us hope it will blow over," the Sub-Commissioner said softly. "Your
  father seems to have some quaint idea in his head which he wants to get rid
  of, and Martin Brockenhurst is just as determined that he shall have no
  opportunity."</p>

  <p>"Dash it all! It's Brockenhurst I'm thinking of," Lionel Malladene
  observed. "He and the Governor have always been the best of pals; to tell you
  the truth, we all thought at one time that he was coming into the
  family."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what it is between them," the Sub-Commissioner said
  anxiously, "but I don't believe it is hostility at all. I believe Lord
  Brockenhurst has a very great affection for your father."</p>

  <p>"What is wrong, then? Martin, for all the world, looks afraid of something
  the Governor is about to say or do."</p>

  <p>"He does," the other agreed, "and the worst of it is, I don't believe
  there is a soul living who can stop him. Look at that!"</p>

  <p>What was happening certainly had a sinister appearance. Sinclair, very
  pale and reluctant, came over from the massive door, and laid a large key on
  the table in front of his master. A moment or two later, after a slight
  rearrangement of the decanters upon the table, he left the room by the
  service door. Distinctly, as they sat there in a sort of stupefied silence,
  they all heard the turning of another key, and Sinclair disappeared. Without
  a doubt, they were locked in the dining-room!</p>

  <p>"What is all this, sir?" Lionel asked, leaning towards his father. "Have
  you got up any special entertainment for us?" he added, with a ghastly but
  well-meant attempt at levity. "Charades, or something of that sort, eh?"</p>

  <p>Lord Malladene ignored his son's question. He stood upright at the end of
  the table, looking around at the little company one by one.</p>

  <p>"I have something to say to you all," he began, and his voice had never
  been clearer, nor his countenance less troubled. "It would give me great
  happiness if what I have to say could be revealed just to you who are here
  present, and who are chiefly concerned, and then forgotten, but that cannot
  be. There are others not present who must still be considered."</p>

  <p>The spirit of uneasiness shared by every one of those men seated round the
  table seemed to be growing. Sir Frederick Leversen stumbled, rather than
  rose, to his feet. He leaned a little forward, his thin, talon-like fingers
  clutched at the table as though for support. He looked at his host, and there
  was ghastly pleading in his eye.</p>

  <p>"Your Lordship," he begged, "Lord Malladene, I am not suggesting&mdash;you
  are well in health, of course&mdash;you know what you want to say, yet I
  claim the right to speak one word. You are in the act of committing a crime!
  You are on the verge of a wicked deed! You are contemplating something which
  is worse than suicide! Mr. Malladene, Lord Brockenhurst, I appeal to you
  two&mdash;men of the world. Lord Malladene for the moment is not himself, has
  persisted in this strange enterprise of his. He can do no good&mdash;he can
  ruin lives&mdash;blacken reputations, if he persists in this mad business of
  telling a mad story."</p>

  <p>Lionel Malladene was helpless. He had no idea how to deal with the
  situation.</p>

  <p>"Why appeal to me?" he asked vaguely. "I have no idea what it is my father
  wishes to say."</p>

  <p>"Lord Brockenhurst," the lawyer pleaded, turning to Martin, "you know more
  about this wretched business than anyone else here. Surely you must see as
  clearly as though it were painted upon the wall in front of you what is
  coming! Our host has brooded over this business&mdash;he has lost his
  balance&mdash;he is about to commit an irretrievable folly!"</p>

  <p>Afterwards Martin often reflected with amazement upon what was undoubtedly
  a fact. It was the foolish, terrified cowardice of Frederick Leversen which
  was his inspiration that night. His first idea had been to take Leversen by
  the coat-collar&mdash;find a way out of the room somehow&mdash;and throw him
  into the outer darkness, anywhere, so long as that hateful little voice could
  be stilled, and the trouble which it was to cause might be stifled. Then,
  suddenly the way became clear. He knew exactly what he had to do, what he had
  to say, how he had to talk to this little semicircle of men. He even felt
  that he knew how to talk to Lord Malladene himself.</p>

  <p>"You must allow me a few words, sir," he begged.</p>

  <p>Lord Malladene, smiling with bitter scorn across the table at the lawyer,
  who was still muttering incomprehensible words, suddenly turned away from him
  and faced his vis-&agrave;-vis.</p>

  <p>"Let it alone, Martin," he enjoined. "Leversen's interruption is unwelcome
  to me and utterly out of place. I had hoped that at my own table I might have
  been allowed to tell my own story in my own way. The fates have willed it
  otherwise. I shall continue, but what I have to say must be a little
  differently presented."</p>

  <p>Martin Brockenhurst, from his slightly superior height, looked down the
  table and stretched out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Malladene," he said, "you were my father's dearest friend, you are the
  one person to whom I have looked up all my life with the utmost
  respect&mdash;forgive me if I add, with very great affection&mdash;forgive me
  if my behaviour is inexcusable. It is I who am going to tell your story."</p>

  <p>The newly appointed Sub-Commissioner, without rising wholly to his feet,
  leaned a little forward in his place. He looked at Martin&mdash;he turned
  towards Lord Malladene&mdash;and there was a queer sort of pleading in the
  few words he uttered.</p>

  <p>"My host," he began, "my friend, and, I think I may say, my one-time
  associate, Lord Brockenhurst: listen please to just these words of common
  sense from a man who knows every thought that is in your mind. The words that
  you two are proposing to speak can never be taken back; once spoken, they
  will live for ever in the minds of everyone here present; they will do
  incalculable, irredeemable mischief. Lord Malladene, you are famous amongst
  every one of your confr&egrave;res for your judicial mind; and you yourself
  were the first I ever heard who enunciated this dictum: 'No man can plead, or
  even state his own case.' Martin Brockenhurst, let me say my few words, and
  when I have finished, take up, if you will, my story."</p>

  <p>There was an end then of that tenseness in the atmosphere, caused by the
  continual recurrence of that awesome silence. Leversen was still muttering
  incoherently to himself. Simon Lebur, white-haired, stern, and dignified, sat
  perfectly still with trembling lips in an attitude of intense listening.
  Neither Malladene nor Martin, both of whom were deeply impressed by the
  Sub-Commissioner's passionate earnestness, felt inclined to interrupt him.
  The latter leaned a little farther forward; his voice was neither so clear as
  the voice of the Judge, nor so firm as Martin Brockenhurst's. There was a
  certain gruffness about it which was characteristic of the man, but every
  word that he spoke was distinctly audible.</p>

  <p>"It was Lord Malladene's intention when he rose to his feet," he
  continued, "to tell you of an incident which occurred in the famous Lebur
  murder case when I happened to be in his court. Lord Brockenhurst was there,
  Sir Frederick Leversen was there, the two counsel representing the prisoner
  were there, and Lord Malladene himself occupied the dignified and honourable
  position of Judge. It was Lord Malladene's intention to tell you tonight of
  the message that Sir Frederick Leversen sent across to him from the
  prisoner."</p>

  <p>Again a brief silence. Leversen's fingers were being drawn across the
  tablecloth, making a curious, scratching noise. Malladene was as silent and
  as motionless as the Sphinx.</p>

  <p>"You all remember the case of which I am speaking, in which Richard Lebur,
  the son of our friend Simon Lebur here, was standing in the dock, charged
  with the murder of David Culpepper. The evidence was almost damning. You were
  not all in court, but those of you who were there remember the tension when
  that message was handed up to the Judge. You will remember that Lord
  Malladene conferred for a few minutes with the Clerk. You will remember the
  little breath of relief almost, when both announced that the prisoner had
  sought for and obtained permission of the Judge to change his plea to
  'Guilty,' but none of you know, however, at whose advice that plea was
  offered, and for what reason the Judge decided to accept it. You are going to
  know now. Lord Malladene invited you here tonight with the idea of telling
  you. He shall <i>not</i> tell you. It is <i>I</i> who will tell you, and Lord
  Brockenhurst who will confirm what I say. Richard Lebur changed his plea to
  'Guilty' for one reason&mdash;to escape the indignity of being hanged, and of
  bringing upon his father, and his father's family, the disgrace which could
  never be wiped out. There was another reason, and that was, to shield the
  woman whom Richard Lebur had found with a revolver smoking in her hand,
  standing over the dead man."</p>

  <p>The Sub-Commissioner paused, but only for a moment. The drama seemed to
  have faded from the story. There was something missing. They all felt
  it&mdash;they were all speechless. The Sub-Commissioner hastened on.</p>

  <p>"Now, Sir Frederick," he said, turning to the lawyer, "I think you had
  better resume your seat."</p>

  <p>Leversen was indeed a pitiful sight! Conscience he had been born without;
  cowardice was one of his natural traits; there was no quality he possessed at
  that moment which could sustain him. He sank across the table, mumbling a
  little to himself.</p>

  <p>"In your younger days," the Sub-Commissioner went on, "when Lord Malladene
  was a brilliant barrister at the Bar, he had been given briefs by Leversen.
  The intimacy which must always exist between lawyer and barrister existed
  between them. There came a night, just before the trial, when Lord Malladene
  lost his nerve. He sent for Leversen. He made a certain confession.
  Leversen's advice was promptly given, and though it was scoffed at, at the
  time, it was finally adopted by Lord Malladene."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you tell them the truth, Mr. Sub-Commissioner?" Lord Malladene
  said gently. "It was given because, otherwise, a confession I had already
  written out would have been made public, and the disgrace seemed to me worse
  torment than the hell I have lived since."</p>

  <p>"Confession?" Simon Lebur muttered doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"It was I," Lord Malladene continued, "who shot David Culpepper. I was the
  other possible visitor to that lady who lives still, I believe, under the
  name of Mrs. Culpepper. The man arrived in a fury when I was the guest of the
  lady in question. He came at me like a madman. How the revolver found its way
  into my hand, I never clearly remember, but I used it; and sooner than submit
  to the indignity of a blow, I shot the man who came raging at me. Afterwards
  I was pushed out of the place. Richard Lebur, who had been waiting in another
  room, came in after I had left and saw Culpepper dead on the ground. The
  woman was holding the revolver. He snatched it from her&mdash;the rest is
  quite an old story."</p>

  <p>"You were visiting the woman," Lionel Malladene muttered, half to himself,
  but gazing at his father.</p>

  <p>"That is quite true, Lionel," was the grim reply. "She was the one folly
  of my middle age. You can judge for yourself how I have paid for it."</p>

  <p>"Now," Martin intervened, "let me speak to you, Simon Lebur, and to you
  others here, including Leversen. You must all leave this place knowing the
  truth. The man who shot David Culpepper was Lord Malladene. Richard Lebur was
  found guilty of the crime, and sentenced to a long term of imprisonment in
  Dartmoor, from which he made, I shall be inclined to think, a providential
  escape. He is now a thousand miles away. The Sub-Commissioner here was deeply
  impressed with the conviction of his innocence, and for that reason he
  avoided arresting him, which he could have done a few days ago. I myself was
  convinced of his innocence&mdash;I cannot exactly tell you why&mdash;but my
  honest belief at the first was that Richard Lebur was shielding the woman.
  Just lately I learned the truth. I kept my mouth shut. Listen to me, Simon
  Lebur. Here is our friend the Sub-Commissioner; he was very slightly to blame
  for not making more vigorous efforts to arrest Richard Lebur, but, on the
  other hand, he was perfectly right as it turned out, because Richard Lebur
  was not guilty. I was much more to blame because, for a period of only a few
  days, but still for a definite period, I have known the truth. I, too,
  stumbling upon it by an accident, and guilty of offering a bribe, discovered
  that Richard Lebur was innocent. Lastly there comes the question of Sir
  Frederick Leversen."</p>

  <p>The lawyer half rose from his seat.</p>

  <p>"What about me?" he cried out. "What are you charging me with?"</p>

  <p>"It was you," Martin declared, "who, when Lord Malladene sent for you and
  said that it was beyond his power to try this man, confessed himself guilty
  of the crime, and asked for your advice, it was you who put into his head the
  scheme of saving Richard Lebur's life without forfeiting his own. Lord
  Malladene was ready to make his confession; it was you who persuaded him to
  keep silent. In your way, you were clever&mdash;you knew very well that,
  sooner than sentence him to be hanged, Lord Malladene would have left his
  confession behind him, but he would have confessed. There we are, the four of
  us, Simon Lebur. Looking at the case fairly, you alone should be our judge.
  What have you to say to us?"</p>

  <p>The old man's face was hidden in his hands for a moment. Again the little
  company was reduced to silence, but this time it was the silence of complete
  shock. Leversen was groaning slightly to himself. He half staggered to his
  feet; his voice was scarcely audible.</p>

  <p>"I, too, have my confession," he moaned. "I used every effort I had to
  urge Lord Malladene to keep silence, for I knew that Richard Lebur was bad.
  Lord Malladene has not told you the worst so far as I am concerned. Month by
  month, relentlessly, all the time, beginning with small sums, and moving on
  to larger ones, I have blackmailed him. Over one hundred thousand pounds of
  his family property and his savings ... I can't go on. I will make
  restitution&mdash;I will return every penny&mdash;I swear it!"</p>

  <p>He suddenly collapsed. Martin ignored him altogether; his eyes were fixed
  upon Simon Lebur, who had risen to his feet and was standing with his hand
  upon Malladene's shoulder. His eyes were bright, the deadly pallor had gone
  from his cheeks, and his voice was as clear as a bell.</p>

  <p>"My friends, if you will all permit me to call you so for a moment, Lord
  Malladene and I have changed places. I am to be the Judge. Very well, I say
  this, and I say it to my sorrow, and if I felt that I had failed in any of my
  efforts when my son was a lad, I should say it also to my shame. His mother
  and I did all that we could for our only child. We wished him more than
  anything in the world to grow in righteousness. Where we were to blame, I
  cannot state, but we failed. Here am I, a very old man, and nothing but the
  truth can come from my lips. My son was a bad man. The punishment that he has
  endured should wipe out the memory of any injustice he may have suffered; the
  punishment that you, Lord Malladene, have endured wipes out from my
  consciousness every scrap of revengeful feeling. I pray you, Lord Malladene,
  from the bottom of my heart&mdash;I implore you, as I am sure everyone in
  this room would implore you, to wipe out from your mind all memory of the
  past. I pray you to pursue to the end your honourable career. I was bidden
  tonight by your Lordship," Simon Lebur concluded, "to a 'Mystery Dinner.' Let
  it, so long as we live, to all of us here remain just that, and no more. The
  mystery is solved; the dinner is over. All that is needed
  is&mdash;forgetfulness. This is the earnest and devout prayer of a man who
  has passed his eightieth year; who believes that he is showing you what the
  justice of the Great Unseen would be."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The silence which followed the last quavering words of Simon Lebur was
  tense with repressed and half-joyous emotion. Action followed swift and
  decisive. Charlesworth's hand dashed underneath the crumpled napkin by Lord
  Malladene's side&mdash;in a moment the small glittering weapon which had been
  concealed there was in the Sub-Commissioner's hand. The amazed little company
  seated around the dining-table heard the click of the safety catch, saw the
  cartridges fall into Charlesworth's hand. Almost immediately they, together
  with the weapon itself, had disappeared into the pocket of his dinner coat
  and Charlesworth himself was on his feet. He leaned towards Lord Malladene
  and it is probable that there had never before been such earnestness in his
  tone.</p>

  <p>"Lord Malladene," he said, "the man Richard Lebur has passed into an
  unknown land. The law is no longer interested in him. You have heard the
  pleading of his aged father. I would not be guilty of this presumption save
  that I know I am only anticipating your own idea. On the first of the month
  tomorrow morning the time arrives when your voluntary retirement from your
  present high position becomes a legal possibility. May we drink to your
  Lordship's health, and wish you long life and happiness in the period of
  repose which during the service of your country for so many years you have so
  wonderfully earned?"</p>

  <p>Charlesworth hesitated for a moment and then drew a long breath of relief.
  Malladene's eyes met his and he knew that the crisis was over. All those who
  had been seated at the table stumbled to their feet. The decanters flashed
  around, glasses were raised, never was a toast drank more fervently.
  Listening upstairs Diana cried aloud with joy as she heard the sound of the
  hoarse but joyous voices below and the sound of Charlesworth's last
  words.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen, the toast is Lord Malladene and his happy retirement."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>It was an hour or so later when Martin's trembling fingers turned the key
  which he had drawn from his pocket, leading into a room that he at first took
  to be empty. Then he saw her, standing by the side of a picture; saw her
  hesitation; saw the deeper colour mounting in her cheeks; saw her eyes
  questioning him fiercely, lovingly, passionately; and then she was too
  closely wrapped in his arms for him to see anything else, and conversation
  for a time was difficult. He held her a little away from him at last. He
  realized that she had on a very lovely dress and was wearing her pearls, and
  that she looked more beautiful than he had ever seen her before in his life.
  She pointed to a little table, drawn up in a distant corner.</p>

  <p>"Will it bore you very much," she asked, "if we have our celebration feast
  here alone? I can't share my happiness, even though it is silent, with anyone
  else but Leida."</p>

  <p>"There is no spot in the world," he answered fervently, "where I would
  rather pass what is left to us of the evening than just here as we are."</p>

  <p>She sank down on to the divan by his side.</p>

  <p>"I wanted you to say that," she whispered joyfully. "It was here you were
  to have dined with me. Well, I remembered that you were to have come straight
  from the Malladene feast. I thought of that, so I ate my few biscuits, and I
  drank a glass of wine; then Leida and I set out that small Chippendale
  sideboard that you love. There is fruit, there are sandwiches cut as you like
  them, there is wine&mdash;your favourite wine&mdash;and just a few little
  things, because it may turn out that I am hungrier than you are. When I am
  happy, you know how greedy I am!"</p>

  <p>"It was a divine inspiration of yours," he said. "Although I am not going
  to make a long story of it, Pamela, there are papers here which you should
  see, because it is our dedication feast to one another. What your world-famed
  compatriot would have called a 'Divine Betrothal.' It is not a very beautiful
  thing," he went on, drawing a crumpled piece of parchment from his pocket,
  "but this I have carried with me for many days."</p>

  <p>"But what is it that you have there?" she cried, struggling to decipher
  the crabbed printing.</p>

  <p>"That is our marriage licence."</p>

  <p>She clutched at his arm. "Why," she begged, "what is there that has
  changed?"</p>

  <p>"This," he answered, drawing another document from his pocket. "This may
  give you a slight feeling of disgust, Pamela. Forget it. We know what Richard
  Lebur was, although he has now shown himself capable of everything that he
  could conceive in the way of generosity. He was already married to a barmaid
  when he married you. This is his certificate. You have never been married to
  Richard Lebur; all that is a hideous nightmare. Day by day we shall push a
  little farther back the things that it is a joy to forget, and live only for
  the days that it will be a Paradise to feel and to remember."</p>

  <p>She was sobbing quietly with her face buried on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Martin," she faltered. "I cannot speak&mdash;I cannot believe that this
  is all real."</p>

  <p>"So far as we are concerned," he assured her, "it is all real, and it is
  the end of our suffering. Tomorrow we will go and talk to a priest. One
  second," he begged, a little hurriedly, for there was something so exquisite
  in her face, such a softening in her eyes, he almost feared to listen to
  spoken words, "only one second, and then you shall hear the popping of the
  cork, and we shall carry those dishes over from the sideboard and our feast
  will be served. The Malladene dinner was a great banquet, but it brought us
  face to face with what might have been an ugly tragedy. It is a long story,
  sweetheart, but it is not a story to gloat over, only to wonder at and be
  thankful. You shall hear everything, but it must come slowly, and it must
  come not so much as a narrative as a revelation."</p>

  <p>She caught up her skirts and almost ran to the sideboard.</p>

  <p>"We are both too hysterical to have the passions and joys of a lifetime
  compressed into these few moments," she cried on her way back. "We should be
  mingling tears with our kisses!"</p>

  <p>She laid down the dish of fruit she was carrying and threw her arms around
  his neck.</p>

  <p>"I would not run so terrible a risk," he murmured breathlessly.</p>

  <p>He pointed to the window. An unexpected splash of moonlight lay across
  their table. He pushed back her chair, and drew her to his side upon the
  divan.</p>

  <p>"The 'Divine Betrothal,'" he smiled.</p>
