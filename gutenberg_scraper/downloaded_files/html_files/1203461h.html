<h2><a name="ch01" id="ch01"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="first">There were only three passengers who alighted
at Wickombe Annerley station from the five-thirty train. Two of
them were, however, in their way, people of consequence. From
the first-class smoking carriage next the engine stepped Henry
Aynesworth, Marquis of Lakenham, six foot two and a half, broad
and burly, with features stained by the suns of tropical
countries and coarsened by a career of excesses so regrettably
flagrant that, notwithstanding the remains of his fortune and
his ancient name, he was heard of more often in the circles of
Bohemia than in the great world to which by birth he belonged.
He wore a light flannel suit, and a straw hat adorned with the
colors of a noted cricket club. He was smoking a large cigar,
and he stood by while his servant collected his belongings,
watching the proceedings with an air of prosperous arrogance
wholly and objectionably British. He was forty-two years of age
and he looked older. He had a ruddy brown complexion, a stiff,
fair mustache and a heavy jaw. His eyes were a little watery but
his carriage still retained traces of his soldier training. His
voice was always raised a note or two louder than was actually
necessary.</p>

<p>"Anything here from Annerley Court?" he asked the
station-master.</p>

<p>A long-coated footman who was on his way to the other end of
the platform paused and touched his hat.</p>

<p>"The motor is here, my lord," he said. "Sir Jermyn did not
expect you, I think, until the later train. We had orders to
meet the half-past seven."</p>

<p>"Changed my mind at the last moment," Lord Lakenham declared.
"Fact is, it was so hot in town I was glad to get away. Have you
come to meet any one else?"</p>

<p>"A young lady, sir," the footman replied, edging off.</p>

<p>"Well, there'll be room for me, I dare say," the Marquis
remarked. "What's Sir Jermyn doing today? Cricket, eh?"</p>

<p>"Sir Jermyn is playing against Yorkshire, my lord. The match
should be over in good time."</p>

<p>The Marquis nodded and strolled towards the exit. The footman
hurried to the other end of the platform, where two young ladies
were standing in front of a small pile of luggage, from which a
maid was collecting their belongings. The younger one was only a
child, with fair, freckled face, rather a large mouth, and a
very earnest expression. Her elder sister&mdash;there was no
mistaking their relationship&mdash;was exceedingly dainty and
charming. Her eyes were a trifle dark for her complexion, her
hair fair and wavy, her complexion pale but flawless. She was
dressed in the smartest of white linen traveling gowns, with
white silk stockings and black shoes. Her voice when she
addressed the footman, to whom her sister had called her
attention, was singularly soft.</p>

<p>"Are you from Annerley Court?" she inquired.</p>

<p>The footman touched his hat.</p>

<p>"Yes, miss," he answered. "Sir Jermyn desired me to present
his compliments and to say that he was exceedingly sorry he was
not able to come to the station. He said that he would explain
immediately upon your arrival. He hopes to be at the Court as
soon as we are. There is a cart waiting for the luggage and for
your maid, and a motor for you and the gentleman, miss."</p>

<p>For the first time she glanced down the platform and noticed
the disappearing form of her fellow passenger.</p>

<p>"There is some one else going to Annerley Court, then?"</p>

<p>The footman, who was assisting with the baggage, turned
around for a moment.</p>

<p>"Yes, miss," he replied. "Lord Lakenham has arrived by the
same train."</p>

<p>The footman was now entirely intent upon superintending the
removal of the luggage, and incidentally ingratiating himself
with the young lady's maid, of whose appearance he approved. The
station-master had escorted his distinguished arrival to the
motorcar, the solitary porter was busy hoisting luggage to the
top of the luggage cart, and the child had wandered off to
admire the roses in the station-master's garden. It was a little
country station on a branch line, with a row of white palings, a
single seat, a tiny shed, and on the other side of the single
line of metals, a thick wood. There was no one there to witness
what, in its way, was almost a tragedy. The girl, whom an entire
press and a not ungenerous profession had done their best to
spoil, had forgotten to act. She stood quite still, gazing at
the faint line of smoke which marked the track of the departing
train as though it were carrying away her last hope. All the
soft, delicate girlishness of her features seemed to have
vanished. Her mouth was set, her eyes distended with fear. There
was no one of her admirers who would have recognized her at that
moment. All the little color which she possessed seemed to have
been drawn from her face, all the life and lissome grace to have
passed from her limbs. As the departing train vanished around
the distant curve, she gazed about her wildly, as though seeking
for some way of escape. She shrank as though instinctively away
from the little shed outside which the motor-car was
waiting.</p>

<p>"The luggage is quite all right, madame," the footman
announced, turning round. "If you and the young lady will be so
good as to follow me?"</p>

<p>The child, who had clambered up the white palings, sprang
lightly down.</p>

<p>"Aren't you glad it's a car, Sybil?" she exclaimed. "It will
be just lovely riding in the open air after that stuffy train.
Come along."</p>

<p>The young lady to whom she appealed nerved herself for an
effort. She let fall her traveling veil of white gauze and with
her hand in her sister's followed the footman down the platform,
through the wooden shed and out into the little circular space
where a very handsome motor-car was waiting for them. Lord
Lakenham, who was standing by its side, raised his hat. He was
in one of his very best moods, for he threw away his cigar.</p>

<p>"We are to be fellow passengers to Annerley Court, I hear,"
he said. "May I introduce myself? My name is Lakenham. Will you
allow me?"</p>

<p>She stepped into the car with a slight inclination of the
head. For a moment or two Lord Lakenham seemed to forget his
manners. The child passed by him unaided. He stood as though
turned to stone, staring at the half-concealed countenance of
the young lady, who was already ensconced in a corner of the
car.</p>

<p>"Are you not coming?" she asked calmly. "There is plenty of
room."</p>

<p>Lord Lakenham recovered himself with a little effort.</p>

<p>"Of course I am," he answered. "I&mdash;well, I forgot where
I was for a moment. Now we're all right."</p>

<p>He took the seat opposite the two girls and the car glided
off. His eyes still seemed to be seeking to penetrate that
closely drawn veil.</p>

<p>"Delicious, this is, after the train, isn't it?" he remarked.
"May I not have the privilege of knowing your name? We are to be
fellow-guests at Annerley, I believe, so I shall only be
anticipating a few minutes."</p>

<p>"My name is Cluley," she told him, "and this is my little
sister&mdash;Mary Cluley. We are only making a very brief visit
to Annerley."</p>

<p>"Cluley," he repeated, thoughtfully. "Seems a familiar name
to me, somehow. I wonder why?...Ah! of course, there's Sybil
Cluley, the girl at the Imperial Theatre, who seems to have
turned the heads of half the men in London."</p>

<p>"My name is Sybil Cluley," she said quietly.</p>

<p>Lord Lakenham slapped his knee and chuckled.</p>

<p>"By Jove, then, that accounts for it!" he exclaimed. "I knew
I'd seen you before. Came over me for a certainty directly you
got into the motor, only I couldn't imagine where. You were
mixed up with something in my mind and I couldn't work it out. I
am delighted to know you, Miss Cluley. Had the pleasure of
seeing you act, of course."</p>

<p>The girl inclined her head. Her sister leaned forward from
her seat.</p>

<p>"Nearly every one, wherever we go, knows Sybil by sight," she
told Lord Lakenham confidentially. "It's so funny sometimes when
we are out in the streets together. People stop and turn round,
and in the shops I can often hear them whispering and telling
one another who Sybil is. Have you seen 'The Tangled Web'?"</p>

<p>"Several times," Lord Lakenham assured her. "Parts of it are
a trifle too clever for me but it's a jolly good show, all the
same. Your sister's the making of it, to my mind."</p>

<p>"Sybil is ripping!" Mary declared. "Everybody says so. It's
quite her best part. The manager told me himself the other day
that he didn't think there was any one else in London who could
have created it as she has done."</p>

<p>Lord Lakenham smiled tolerantly.</p>

<p>"I should imagine he was quite right," he agreed. "I expect
you're keen to grow up and go on the stage yourself, eh?"</p>

<p>The child looked across at her sister doubtfully. Sybil
Cluley was lying back in her corner seat with half-closed eyes,
as though anxious to escape as much as possible from the
conversation. She opened them now, however, wide enough.</p>

<p>"Mary will never go upon the stage," she said firmly. "I have
made other plans for her."</p>

<p>The child laughed gayly enough, yet with a note of
regret.</p>

<p>"Sybil's saving all her money," she explained to her
companion, "so that soon after I leave school we can travel
together for a time and then live somewhere down in the country.
I don't believe she's a bit fond of acting, really. Isn't it
stupid!"</p>

<p>Lord Lakenham stroked his stubbly moustache and gazed a
little curiously at the eager-faced child who sat opposite to
him.</p>

<p>"I have heard a good many young ladies of your sister's age
talk like that," he declared, "especially after the first
excitement of their success has worn off. It doesn't last,
though. There's no profession in the world, they say, like the
stage for holding one."</p>

<p>Mary seemed doubtful.</p>

<p>"Sybil doesn't often change her mind," she told him. "In fact
she's what I should call stubborn about most things."</p>

<p>"Nice character your young sister's giving you," Lord
Lakenham said, turning to his elder companion with a smile.</p>

<p>Sybil shrugged her shoulders slightly. She seemed curiously
anxious to remain in the background.</p>

<p>"Mary doesn't know everything," she murmured, "nor does she
always mean exactly what she says."</p>

<p>"The natural proclivity of her sex asserting itself in
youth!" Lord Lakenham remarked, didactically. "What?"</p>

<p>Sybil only smiled very faintly and looked away with the air
of one whom the conversation had ceased to interest. The car had
climbed a hill and was rushing down now into the valley. Mary
was leaning back in her seat with a keen air of enjoyment.</p>

<p>"Isn't it lovely to be in the country again!" she cried.
"Look at those glorious woods, Sybil! Are we anywhere near Sir
Jermyn's house, Lord Lakenham?"</p>

<p>"We shall turn in at the gates in a few moments," the Marquis
replied. "You can see them straight ahead there. Nice little
place of its sort, Annerley Court. Have you ever been down
before, Miss Cluley?" he added, turning to the girl by his
side.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Never," she answered. "Sir Jermyn has asked me once or twice
but I have not been able to leave the theatre. Now I have a
short vacation and we are going to read his new play together.
Mine is really a business visit, you see."</p>

<p>Lord Lakenham nodded with a sudden understanding. The coming
of Miss Sybil Cluley to Annerley Court had been puzzling him
immensely.</p>

<p>"Why, of course!" he exclaimed. "I read in one of the papers
only this morning that Jermyn had a new play almost finished,
and that you were to take the leading part. Clever chap, Jermyn,
in his way. Have you known him long, Miss Cluley?"</p>

<p>"I have known Sir Jermyn for about a year," she answered
quietly. "He is certainly very clever, indeed. I have played in
a short sketch he wrote some time ago, at the
<i>Haymarket</i>."</p>

<p>"I remember it quite well," Lord Lakenham declared. "Dismal
sort of affair it was, too! I can't make out why Jermyn never
ends up anything he writes, happily. It may be artistic, and all
that, but I'm hanged if I like it!"</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows very slightly.</p>

<p>"Do you believe, then," she asked, "that everything in life
should end happily?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid I am one of those obvious sort of persons who
want it to in the books I read and the plays I go to see," he
admitted. "What do you say, Miss Mary? Don't you want the fairy
prince to marry the right girl, and all that sort of thing, at
the end of the story, eh?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do," the child answered, confidently. "So does
every one."</p>

<p>"Not always," Lord Lakenham objected. "Our host doesn't, for
one."</p>

<p>"Sir Jermyn is an artist," Sybil murmured.</p>

<p>"Daresay he is," Lord Lakenham assented. "All the same, I'd
like to see him a little more cheerful sometimes. I don't see
the use of writing about problems that never solve themselves,
or marriages that always go wrong, or lovers who never come
together. Waste of time, I call it. Sort of cousin of mine,
Jermyn, you know, Miss Cluley."</p>

<p>She accepted the information without any great sign of
interest. They had turned off the main road now, through some
plain iron gates, and were crossing a park dotted here and there
with dwarfed oak trees. Mary clapped her hands.</p>

<p>"Deer!" she cried, with enthusiasm. "Do you see, Sybil, there
are actually deer! I wonder if they are very wild?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," Lord Lakenham assured her. "They'd be all
right, anyhow, at this time of the year. Eat biscuits out of
your hand, I daresay. We'll try them to-morrow. I haven't been
here for ages," he went on, looking around him. "Ripping little
golf course one could make here. Do you play golf, Miss
Cluley?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I haven't time for that sort of thing," she told him. "Mary
plays games for us both. I am quite contented if I can get an
hour's walk every morning."</p>

<p>Some note in her tone&mdash;or was it the curve of her head
as she leaned sideways to look up into the woods?&mdash;stirred
in him once more that curious sense of a half-awakened memory.
It was more than curiosity which he felt&mdash;it was an
interest which had almost an emotional side.</p>

<p>"It's a rum thing!" he exclaimed, meditatively, with his eyes
fixed upon her. "Every now and then, Miss Cluley, I get a sort
of an idea that I've seen you before, not on the stage at
all."</p>

<p>She did not answer him for a moment. Unseen, her right hand
was gripping the leather strap by her side. She kept her eyes
fixed upon the house, which had just come into sight. If only
she could control her voice! If only she could check his efforts
at recollection!</p>

<p>"I think it most unlikely, Lord Lakenham," she said coldly.
"I go out very little and I have few friends."</p>

<p>"And I am quite sure that we never knew anybody who was a
marquis before, did we?" Mary chimed in, with a triumphant sense
of administering a <i>coup de grbce</i> to the subject. "Is this
really the house? Oh, Sybil, isn't it lovely!"</p>

<p>"Beautiful, dear," Sybil assented.</p>

<p>Lord Lakenham eyed the structure disparagingly.</p>

<p>"Not much of a place," he said. "I don't care about these
plain Georgian mansions. Never seen Lakenham, by the bye, have
you, Miss Cluley?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I do not even know where it is."</p>

<p>He laughed boisterously.</p>

<p>"That's a nasty one for me," he declared. "Rather a show
place, you know, Miss Cluley. Never mind, I hope you'll see it
some day. There's old Jermyn got here first, after all. I wonder
who the dickens he's got to play hostess? I'm hanged if I don't
believe&mdash;why, it's Lucille!"</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch02" id="ch02"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="first">Jermyn Annerley was, in the parlance of the
gossiping journalists of the day, a very interesting figure in
Society. He was tall, and he had the good looks which go with
clean-cut features a little on the large side, a very sensitive
mouth, and deep-set, keen, but rather introspective gray eyes.
He had done exceedingly well at college but had distinguished
himself chiefly in athletics. Nothing, the sporting critics
declared, but a certain lack of enthusiasm had prevented him
from becoming one of the most brilliant amateur batsmen of the
day. He had actually, however, had the astounding strength of
will to give up cricket altogether for two years which he spent
in traveling, and a curious inclination to regard the game as a
recreation rather than as an all-engrossing pursuit had more
than once mystified the little body of gentlemen who from the
neighborhood of St. John's Wood controlled the cricket destinies
of their country. He had never entered a profession, and
although he had gone out to South Africa as a matter of course,
the army as a career presented no attractions to him. He had
written a novel which was too clever to be successful, a few
articles in the reviews which had attracted a great deal of
attention, and the most popular Society comedy of the day. He
was known to be rich; he was unmarried, charming to all women
but obviously unimpressionable. The worst thing that had been
said about him was that he was a prig.</p>

<p>He stood now at the open door, waiting to receive his guests,
composed and yet a little eager as his eyes followed the
approach of the car. The woman who stood by his side watched him
curiously from underneath the lace of the parasol which she held
over her head. From the first she had been suspicious of the
coming of this girl.</p>

<p>"Who is Lucille?" Sybil Cluley asked, as the automobile
glided around the last bend of the avenue.</p>

<p>"Duchesse de Sayers," Lord Lakenham replied. "She is a sort
of cousin of ours&mdash;was an Aynesworth, you know. She married
a Frenchman who turned out a regular rotter, and divorced him.
She hates her name and hates her title, so nearly every one
calls her Lucille. Great pal of Jermyn's."</p>

<p>The car drew up in front of the house. Jermyn held out both
his hands to Sybil as he assisted her to alight.</p>

<p>"This is delightful!" he exclaimed. "I shall never be able to
make sufficient apologies for not having been at the station to
receive you, but if there is a greater autocrat in this world
than your enemy the call-boy, it is the captain of a county
cricket team. Mary, you've grown since last week, but you've got
to kiss me all the same because I'm your host. Glad to see you,
Lakenham. We didn't expect you till the later train. Miss
Cluley," he went on, "I want to present you to my far-away
cousin, who is good enough to be hostess for me sometimes
the&mdash;Duchesse de Sayers."</p>

<p>"I am very glad to welcome you to Annerley," Lucille said
slowly, as she held out her hand. "I have been anxious to meet
you ever since I saw your wonderful performance in Jermyn's
play."</p>

<p>"Miss Cluley and I are much too modest for that sort of
thing," Jermyn laughed. "There is some tea on the other side of
the house, in the gardens. I hope that you want yours, Mary, as
badly as I do. Come along."</p>

<p>There was some further interchange of conventional speeches
and they all moved slowly together into the great hall. Jermyn
led the way across the white stone flags, smooth with age and
shining like marble, past the broad staircase, to where at the
end of a corridor, through an open door, was a vista of terraced
gardens, cool and brilliant.</p>

<p>"I do hope that you will like it here," he whispered in
Sybil's ear. "I have been looking forward so much to your
visit."</p>

<p>She raised her eyes to his and he was suddenly struck with
the new thing which he saw there. It was the look of a
frightened animal, the weak craving protection from the
strong.</p>

<p>"It will be lovely," she answered. "I am sure that it will be
lovely."</p>

<p>"You have felt the heat, I am afraid? It must have been a
terribly trying journey."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"It was nothing," she replied. "I had a good many things to
see to before I could get away, and traveling generally gives me
a headache. Directly I sit down in your garden it will have
passed."</p>

<p>"My garden," he smiled, "shall be like the garden of the
Eastern sage. When you open the gate and step inside, all manner
of evil things shall pass away."</p>

<p>The corridor was hung with portraits. Right over the door
through which they were to pass, the face of a man in scarlet
uniform frowned down upon them.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" she asked, a little sharply.</p>

<p>He glanced up carelessly.</p>

<p>"A great-uncle&mdash;the third Marquis of
Lakenham&mdash;Lakenham's grandfather, by the bye."</p>

<p>She shivered distinctly. Once more he caught the look in her
eyes which had puzzled him.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," he remarked, smiling, "that you don't like the
look of my ancestors!"</p>

<p>She glanced cautiously around. The others had paused for a
moment while Mary made friends with some dogs.</p>

<p>"I do not like Lord Lakenham," she whispered. "No, don't look
so horrified, please. Of course he hasn't been rude to me, or
anything of that sort, but I heard of him once I didn't like
what I heard. He&mdash;somehow he frightens me."</p>

<p>Jermyn looked genuinely distressed.</p>

<p>"My dear Sybil," he exclaimed, "I am so sorry! It is quite a
fluke his being here. I had no idea, even, that he was coming
until yesterday. He is on his way to Scotland. To-morrow I will
give him a hint."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"You mustn't," she begged. "He would guess at once. Don't say
anything. This is really quite foolish, you know, and I am very,
very sorry," she added, a little wistfully.</p>

<p>He drew her arm through his.</p>

<p>"Come," he insisted, "let us forget it. I am longing to show
you my gardens. Those cedar trees are over five hundred years
old. The critics, you among them sometimes, tell me often that I
am too imaginative. Tell me, if you had been brought up in their
shadow, in these gardens, wouldn't you, too, open your heart to
fancies?"</p>

<p>They had passed now through the doorway and she looked around
her in mingled amazement and delight. This was really the front
of the house, surrounded by a long, stone-flagged walk, bordered
on the garden side by a low stone terrace. Before them were
steps leading on to the lawn, and below, shelving gardens,
brilliant with color, dropped to the lake; and beyond the lake,
the woods. The lawn upon which they stood was as smooth as
velvet, green with the eternal green of age. Beneath the cedar
trees were many cushioned chairs and a glittering tea equipage;
upon another table, jugs of cool drinks and bowls of fruit.</p>

<p>"It is wonderful," she murmured. "It is a little Paradise,
this, in which you live."</p>

<p>For one marvelous moment she forgot. The change from her
little flat in Kensington, which she had scarcely left through
many months of unceasing work and anxiety, was too complete. It
was indeed like fairyland to her. Then Lakenham's voice
behind&mdash;a loud, strident voice&mdash;struck fear once more
into her heart.</p>

<p>"Let's go and find your sister, Miss Mary. Just like Jermyn
to make off with her like this. Come and see fair play. And,
Parkes, before you do another thing mix me a large whisky and
soda with a chunk of ice, please."</p>

<p>Sybil half closed her eyes. Her fairyland seemed to be
crumbling up. Jermyn watched her with a shade of real anxiety
upon his face.</p>

<p>"He isn't really so bad, dear," he whispered, "and we'll
escape nearly all the time."</p>

<p>Once more she looked up at him with that selfsame air, the
air of the child who seeks protection.</p>

<p>"Escape!" she faltered. "Yes, we must escape!"</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch03" id="ch03"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="first">"I call this a most interesting situation,"
Lucille remarked, making a little poke with her parasol at an
intrusive bee. "Our one dramatist of the younger school who can
lay claim to any measure of inspiration&mdash;forgive me,
Jermyn, but I love to quote the <i>Daily Mail</i>&mdash;is
studying in these romantic surroundings the woman who is the
chief interpreter of his genius. How do you like that, all of
you? If you would eat bread and butter a little less vigorously,
my dear Jermyn, and keep your eyes fixed upon Miss Cluley, you
might help the illusion."</p>

<p>"Much too hungry," Jermyn replied, lifting up a silver cover
and helping himself to a scone. "I had scarcely any lunch. They
would put me in first wicket down."</p>

<p>"Make any?" Lord Lakenham inquired.</p>

<p>"Forty-two," Jermyn answered, holding out his cup for more
tea. "Rather a sound innings, too. Mary, if you don't eat
another scone, our single wicket cricket match to-morrow is
off."</p>

<p>Mary helped herself without hesitation.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you can bowl googlies?" she asked. "A girl at
school can."</p>

<p>"My dear child," Jermyn assured her impressively, "I can bowl
anything. There are times after the ball has left my hands when
a very demon seems to possess it. I can make it swerve in the
air like an American baseball pitcher, or do a double break all
round the bat."</p>

<p>"Don't believe a word of it," Mary declared, derisively. "I
don't believe there is such a thing as a double break."</p>

<p>"Pity they never tried you for the county," Lord Lakenham
remarked. "I never remember seeing you bowl an over in a match
in my life."</p>

<p>Jermyn sighed gently as he stirred his tea.</p>

<p>"There is so much jealousy in county cricket," he explained.
"If you are played for your batting, you are expected to bat and
to make runs. To bowl as well is not good form."</p>

<p>"Ever been put on?" Lakenham persisted.</p>

<p>"Never," Jermyn confessed. "That, however, is entirely due to
my modesty. I have never mentioned my peculiar acquirements.
Wait until you see me bowl, Mary, at the nets to-morrow!
Lucille, Miss Cluley will have a little more tea."</p>

<p>"Miss Cluley is finding you all much too frivolous," Lucille
pronounced. "She sides with me, I am sure. Jermyn ought to be
lying on the grass, studying every trick of your features, every
change of your expression, oughtn't he, Miss Cluley? This is his
great opportunity."</p>

<p>"I am not sure," Sybil replied, "that a tea-party is
calculated to call up any emotions worth studying."</p>

<p>"My dear," Lucille declared, "a tea-party is sometimes an
epitome of all the passions. I have known tragedies lived and
acted during the progress of this apparently harmless meal. I
have seen women share a plate of muffins who I knew were
thirsting for one another's blood. In Hungary I remember two
deputies who were absolutely the most polite men there, who went
out and fought a most savage duel ten minutes after taking
chocolate and sweetmeats with me. There is no telling what
feelings may be concealed between the lightest and idlest of
chatter. Don't you agree with me, Miss Cluley?"</p>

"My dear," Lucille declared, "a tea-party is sometimes an
epitome of all the passions."</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>Sybil looked up and met Lucille's gaze, half lazy, half
insolent. Quick of comprehension, she was suddenly conscious of
an enemy. Her heart sank but she answered coolly enough.</p>

<p>"Repression is rather the fashion, nowadays, isn't it? It
makes acting very difficult. After all, you know, a little noise
does help."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you won't get much out of Jermyn," Lucille said.
"His methods are almost crawly, they are so quiet."</p>

<p>"Give me a good honest melodrama," Lakenham declared. "I like
to see my hero and my villain on the stage and have them fight
it out. Plenty of blood-letting, I say. It's the old-fashioned
method but it's the surest and safest. <i>Drury Lane</i> for me
all the time! Now why are you looking at me so intently, Miss
Cluley? Of course, you think I'm talking rubbish."</p>

<p>Sybil withdrew her eyes with a little start.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," she replied, "I think that I was
agreeing with you. Craft goes a long way round but it sometimes
loses its way. Simple force speaks first and speaks, perhaps,
more surely."</p>

<p>There was a brief pause. Sybil's words were spoken lightly
enough yet Jermyn turned round to glance at her. There was a
strain of earnestness in the conversation which he did not quite
appreciate.</p>

<p>"In these days, unfortunately," Lucille said, "the subtler
methods of requital are safer. To poison your dearest enemy
might lead to most unpleasant reprisals, but you can at least
tell everybody where she buys her hats, and the secret of her
complexion."</p>

<p>Jermyn shivered palpably.</p>

<p>"You women are crueller by nature than we are," he declared.
"A simple shot through the heart would satisfy us. Now," he
added, rising to his feet, "I want to warn you all that I am
going to be a monopolist. I am going to take Miss Cluley away by
myself into the most secluded spot I can think of, and I shan't
even tell you where it is. The rest of you can do exactly as you
like. Lakenham, you can flirt with Lucille&mdash;she is just
from Paris and in splendid practice&mdash;or you can play games
with Mary. Please!"</p>

<p>He held out his hands to Sybil. She sprang lightly to her
feet. Her eyes thanked him.</p>

<p>"Nice sort of host you are," Lakenham complained. "I've got
to go to-morrow or the next day. When am I going to see anything
of Miss Cluley?"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," Jermyn replied, "I simply do not care. In
this matter you are a Philistine. You are outside the gates of
the garden in which Miss Cluley and I are privileged to wander.
We belong, you see, to the sacred coterie. We are artists, and
the work of each one of us depends upon the other. I have an
invincible claim to monopolize Miss Cluley altogether."</p>

<p>"Miserable selfishness!" Lakenham grumbled. "You don't
suppose Miss Cluley wants to be talking shop all the time?"</p>

<p>"A remark," Jermyn retorted, "which proves to me, my dear
cousin, that you have never had the privilege of knowing
intimately any one who belongs to the Profession. It's
absolutely all-engrossing, isn't it, Miss Cluley?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely," she admitted.</p>

<p>"That's why you chucked novels and took to plays, I suppose?"
Lakenham asked.</p>

<p>"It was perhaps a mistake," Jermyn acknowledged, with a sigh.
"Before, I was at least a man and a novelist. Now I have sold
myself into slavery&mdash;I am a dramatist. Come along, Miss
Cluley. Don't mind him, really."</p>

<p>Lakenham watched them cross the lawn and disappear in one of
the walks. His eyes never left the girl's figure. Lucille also
turned her head. She watched Sybil with the thoughtful yet
grudging appraisement of a rival.</p>

<p>"The girl has the trick of walking as though she trod on
air," she remarked. "She is really amazingly graceful."</p>

<p>Lakenham grunted. He was still looking at the entrance to the
laurel walk down which the two figures had disappeared.</p>

<p>"If only I could&mdash;remember!" he exclaimed, moodily.</p>

<p>Lucille looked at him with dawning curiosity.</p>

<p>"Remember what?"</p>

<p>He turned around to be sure that Mary was out of hearing. She
had taken some biscuits and was throwing them to the swans in
the lake a little distance away.</p>

<p>"Something about this girl. What does Jermyn have her down
here for and take the trouble to provide a chaperon? What's it
mean, I wonder? Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Who is she?" Lucille repeated. "Now surely that is an
unnecessary question. Everybody knows who Sybil Cluley is."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" he agreed, impatiently. "One gets tired of
reading that she is the prettiest, and most charming, and
sweetest, and most virtuous young actress on the stage. We know
all about that. What I can't get out of my head is that I knew
something of her before all these wonderful things
happened."</p>

<p>His companion was looking at him steadfastly. Her fine eyes
were fixed upon his face, her head was resting upon the slim
fingers of her right hand.</p>

<br>

<p><a id="picB2"></a></p>

</div>

<br>

<p>"How interesting!" she murmured. "You are not going to tell
me that she was one of that innumerable army of your
victims?"</p>

<p>"I tell you I can't remember," he declared, irritably. "A
thing like that always bothers me."</p>

<p>Lucille's fingers trifled with her parasol. From underneath
it, however, she was studying her companion's discontented
expression with real interest.</p>

<p>"It is curious that your memory should have served you such a
trick," she remarked, after a moment's pause. "I wonder whether
it has occurred to you that Miss Cluley might be troubled in the
same manner?"</p>

<p>Lakenham selected a cigar from his case and bit off the end
savagely.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Lucille laughed softly.</p>

<p>"My dear man," she went on, "couldn't you see how she kept
her back to you all the time, whenever she could? I am afraid
that she must dislike you very much indeed. I am rather a keen
observer of these little things and I couldn't help noticing
that she never even glanced towards you if she could help
it."</p>

<p>"Just the same in the motor," Lakenham admitted, reluctantly.
"Can't think what she means by it. She's the prettiest little
thing I ever saw in my life, too!" he added, enthusiastically.
"I've got past the impressionable age, you know, but that girl
could make a fool of me whenever she chose."</p>

<p>"At present," Lucille continued, smoothly, "she seems to have
no inclination in that direction. I agree with you, of 'course,
that she is very sweet and very beautiful, but all the
same&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Lucille smoothed her muslin gown over her knees.</p>

<p>"I don't want Jermyn to marry her," she said quietly.</p>

<p>"Is he thinking of it?"</p>

<p>"It is just the sort of idiotic thing," Lucille declared,
"that one might expect of him. The more I think of it, the more
frightened I become. Jermyn lives all the time with his head in
the clouds. He is straining always to find something better than
the things which actually exist. He worships beauty and he wants
to believe that everything which he sees is beautiful. It is a
very dangerous state. He won't condescend to look down and see
the way ordinary human beings really live. If the girl has her
wits about her, I am afraid it's all up with Jermyn,
unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless what?"</p>

<p>"Unless you can remember!"</p>

<p>Lakenham grinned, amiably yet not pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Devilish amusing, this!" he exclaimed. "We were talking of
<i>Drury Lane</i> just now. Here we are, you and I, villain and
adventuress in the latest melodrama. Can we pick a hole in the
spotless heroine's past?"</p>

<p>"It is at any rate a melodrama of real life," Lucille
declared. "You see, the whole affair is really most annoying for
me. I have always intended to marry Jermyn myself."</p>

<p>"Quite a natural arrangement," Lakenham agreed, "if you
really do intend to take up matrimony again. I am a much better
match, you know."</p>

<p>She looked at him with a faint smile. In her way she was more
beautiful than Sybil, but she was certainly not the type which
appealed to Lakenham.</p>

<p>"I don't think you're quite my style, Aynesworth," she
remarked. "You have lived too long and too rapidly. You should
marry an <i>inginue</i>&mdash;that will probably be your fate in
a few years' time. Why not make a Marchioness of your long-legged
friend down by the pond? She'll be as pretty as her
sister, no doubt, when she grows up."</p>

<p>"Thank you," Lakenham grunted, "I'm not taking that sort into
St. George's, Hanover Square."</p>

<p>"You ought to be thankful to take anything you can get,"
Lucille said, severely. "I don't think any nice girl who knew
what she was doing, would look at you."</p>

<p>"If you slang me much longer," he grumbled, "I'll leave off
trying to remember."</p>

<p>She smiled at him.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of that, Aynesworth. You know, you are
rather a vain man and you are a little piqued. You are just in
the frame of mind to be dogged. Besides, you admire Miss Cluley
yourself. Every man does, of course. Nothing would please you
more than suddenly to remember the sort of thing you would like
to remember about her, and to take her into a quiet corner and
remind her of it. She'd have to be nice to you then, wouldn't
she?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be your husband for anything!" Lakenham declared.
"You're too clever to live with in comfort. Here's the child
coming back."</p>

<p>Lucille rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"I shall take her to see the peacocks," she decided. "She
might be worth cultivating. You had better come, too."</p>

<p>Lakenham shook his head and threw himself into a comfortable
chair.</p>

<p>"Not I," he answered. "I believe her sister's told her not to
talk to me if she can help it. She avoids me all the time, and
I'm sure I don't want to play around with a long-legged brat. I
am going to sit here&mdash;and stir up the ashes of my sinful
past. Perhaps in that way I may remember!"</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch04" id="ch04"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="first">Jermyn led his companion down the narrow path
which threaded the shrubberies, towards the flower gardens.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," he remarked, as he opened the little iron gate
which led into the open spaces, "I am inclined to believe that
Hazlitt was an idiot, and that your art must be, in reality, of
a higher order than any other. You are face to face with a
continual struggle to escape from flagrantly artificial
surroundings. You have all the time to project yourself into an
atmosphere of your own creation. Now down here, for instance, in
my study, which looks over these gardens and across the valley,
work seems almost spontaneous, the thoughts come unbidden."</p>

<p>Her eyes were traveling over the glowing carpet of color,
across the tree tops of the park to the dim blue of the
hills.</p>

<p>"You never told me that your home was so beautiful," she
murmured.</p>

<p>"I wanted you to come and see it for yourself," he replied.
"You see, one is never sure what the place one cares for most in
the world will seem like to anybody else. I do hope that you and
your sister, too, will enjoy this little holiday."</p>

<p>"Do you think there could be any doubt about it?" she asked
him, smiling. "It was so nice of you to invite Mary. I love to
see her in the country. I want to have her grow up fond of the
country and country ways."</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"There is no place quite so dear to me as Annerley," he said.
"At the same time, one has to remember that life is a leaven of
many things. We mustn't be too bucolic. What should we do
without the inspiration of the great cities?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I realize that!" she answered softly. "I know it. I feel
that little thrill of excitement every time I enter London. In a
lesser degree I feel it every time I enter the theatre. It's all
wonderful, of course, and while it lasts it's engrossing enough.
Yet there is always the reverse side and the reverse side is
horrible."</p>

<p>"Is it my fancy," he asked, "or have you come down to-day a
little depressed?"</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>"I started all right," she assured him, "in fact, I think I
felt like a child who has a wonderful holiday before it. Of the
two, I think I was more excited even than Mary."</p>

<p>He looked down into her face, frowning slightly for a
moment.</p>

<p>"I can't help fearing," he said, "that something has annoyed
you. Forgive me, Miss Cluley&mdash;forgive me, Sybil, won't you,
if I ask you a rather impertinent question? Lakenham is my
cousin, of course, and, I believe, a decent fellow in a general
sort of way, but I know also that he can be an unmannerly brute
on occasions. He didn't annoy you, by any chance, on the way
here?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," she answered. "He talked to Mary most of
the time."</p>

<p>"You don't happen to have any prejudice against him, to have
met him or heard of him before to have met him yourself, I
mean?"</p>

<p>Sybil stooped down and picked a spray of lavender, which she
arranged in the bosom of her gown.</p>

<p>"I have never met so exalted a personage as a marquis before
in my life," she declared. "As I told you, I have heard
something which has perhaps prejudiced me, but apart from that I
do not like him. It is a sort of instinct, I suppose. I am
afraid of him. He reminds me of a certain type of man, and that
type of man recalls a short part of my life which makes me
hysterical when I even think of it. That is all. It is very
foolish of me. Let us for these few minutes, at any rate, sweep
him away, up into the clouds or down under the earth. It isn't
worth while letting the thought of him poison this perfect
afternoon. I think that your gardens are the loveliest I have
ever seen. And are those really peaches on the walls?"</p>

<p>He picked one and gave it to her. She ate it with a little
murmur of delight.</p>

<p>"Fancy having all these things growing instead of seeing them
only in the restaurants!" she exclaimed. "How Mary will enjoy
this!"</p>

<p>"We'll have a regular tour of inspection in the morning," he
promised, "but this first half-hour I wanted to spend with you
alone. Come a little further still, Sybil."</p>

<p>He opened a green postern gate, studded with nails and set
into the ancient wall, and they passed through it into a corner
of the park. A little further on was a thickly growing
plantation, an arm stretched out from the belt of forest behind
the house. He opened the gate and they passed inside. The
rabbits scurried away at their feet, the trees overhead grew so
thickly that only little streaks of sunshine lay like a gilded
skein upon the brambles and undergrowth.</p>

<p>"Sybil," Jermyn said quietly, "can't you imagine why it makes
me so happy to have you down here&mdash;why I have been looking
forward to it so much?"</p>

<p>She looked at him for a moment, genuinely startled. One of
the hardest parts of her lonely life during the last few years
had been to keep men from making love to her. She flattered
herself that she knew the exact symptoms, the exact type of man
from whom they might be expected. She was always on her guard.
And yet now she had a sudden feeling that something wonderful
was going to happen, something wholly unexpected, something
against which no measure of preparation nor any possible
resistance could avail her. Their meetings in London, every one
of which she remembered, had been almost formal. Compared with
the men whom she was in the habit of meeting day by day, he had
always seemed to her almost unnaturally serious, a writer
devoted to his art, with a touch of the monk in his disposition.
This change in his voice, a look which she had surprised in his
eyes, amazed her. She felt suddenly weak. He went on.</p>

<p>"Sybil, I want you to be my wife. I want you, if you can, to
care for me just a little at first so that I can teach you some
day to care a great deal. I want to tell you here and now, if
only you will listen, what you have come to mean to me, how much
I love you."</p>

<p>"You can't be serious!" she gasped. "You don't really mean
this!"</p>

<p>He laughed as he stooped a little towards her. All her
strength was passing away. All her power of resistance, if
indeed she had ever desired to resist him, seemed numb. A
rapturous lassitude was upon her. The very instinct of
resistance had perished. She yielded herself willingly to his
arms, his lips.</p>

<p>"Sybil, you must care for me a little," he pleaded. "You
don't know how much you have come to mean to me. You have found
your way into every corner of my life, and when I sit down to
write, my heroine comes back to me and smiles out of your eyes.
Then I put my pen down and I fill my room with fancies which are
so much more wonderful than anything one can write about. I want
you so much, dear. I want to see you here alone with me, just as
I have seen you in your pretty frocks, and with your quaint,
fascinating little ways, drawing the tears and laughter from all
those crowds in London just as easily as you have stolen my
heart. Dear, before we read the play, won't you promise to be
the one heroine of my life?"</p>

<p>"I am not good enough," she sobbed presently, hiding her face
against his shoulder. "You are much too clever and you ought to
marry some one quite different. But of course I love you, and of
course I'll marry you, if you really mean it."</p>

<p>It was nearly seven o'clock before they returned. Lucille was
playing languid croquet with Mary. Lakenham was lounging in a
wicker chair, with his hands in his pockets and a disfiguring
scowl upon his none too handsome features.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell them?" Jermyn whispered.</p>

<p>She caught at his arm.</p>

<p>"Not just yet, please," she begged. "I am a little afraid of
the Duchess, and I am afraid&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped short. He followed her gaze&mdash;she was looking
at Lord Lakenham.</p>

<p>"There is nothing in the world, dear," he insisted, quietly
but firmly, "which should make you afraid. Remember that you
have me to protect you now."</p>

<p>She looked up at him swiftly. That one look was quite enough
for the people upon the lawn!</p>

<p>"It shall be just as you decide," she said, "only&mdash;not
this instant, at any rate."</p>

<p>Lucille raised the lorgnette which hung from her waistband,
and looked at them.</p>

<p>"My dear people," she exclaimed, "you have had time to act a
play instead of reading it."</p>

<p>Jermyn laughed good-humoredly. His cheeks were a little
flushed, his eyes very bright.</p>

<p>"I make no excuses," he declared. "I was perfectly honest
when I announced my intention of monopolizing Miss Cluley. How's
the croquet going?"</p>

<p>"Execrably," Lucille replied. "The child is much too good for
me. That lazy person in the chair flatly refused to play, or I
should never have offered myself up as a sacrifice."</p>

<p>"I am for the last hoop with the blue ball and black's a
rover," Mary announced. "It's quite the loveliest lawn I ever
played on."</p>

<p>Sybil crossed over to her sister. Jermyn and Lucille stood
side by side.</p>

<p>"You really are an angel," he whispered to her. "I am afraid
you must have been bored to death. Never mind, you shall have
your reward. I have some people coming to play bridge with you
this evening."</p>

<p>"Country bridge!" she sighed. "My dear Jermyn, you do make
large demands upon your friends."</p>

<p>"You told me only a few weeks ago," he reminded her, "that
auction bridge was your only real diversion."</p>

<p>"Not the sort of auction bridge, my dear Jermyn, that your
neighbors here know anything about, I am afraid," she replied.
"Never mind, I trust I know my duty as a hostess, although I
don't think I quite understood...I have to do something with
this ball&mdash;I am not sure what. Please stand out of the
way."</p>

<p>They all trooped into the house a few minutes later. Lakenham
lingered behind with Mary.</p>

<p>"You play that game jolly well," he told her.</p>

<p>"I love all games," the child confided to him, "cricket best,
though."</p>

<p>"Did you live in the country when you were young?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Not that I remember," Mary confessed. "I learned to play
cricket at school."</p>

<p>"Can't you remember anywhere at all before London?" he
persisted.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I don't think I can remember as far back as some people,"
she said. "It isn't much fun trying, anyway. Are you going to
play cricket to-morrow, Lord Lakenham?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure," he answered. "I am moving on to-morrow or
the next day. Don't you want some lemonade?"</p>

<p>They all gathered round a small table in the middle of the
hall, where a great bowl of iced claret cup and another of
lemonade had just been brought. Jermyn filled the glasses
himself with a silver ladle. Then he took Sybil's hand.</p>

<p>"Lucille," he said, "and you, Aynesworth, and you too, Mary,"
he added, drawing her to him, "please all of you drink our
healths. Sybil has promised to marry me."</p>

<p>The child gave a little scream of delight which, in its way,
was merciful. Lucille stood for a moment white and still.
Lakenham smiled&mdash;not at all a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>"Quite an interesting announcement," he declared, lifting his
glass to his lips. "My dear Jermyn, I congratulate you. When
this is known, you will be the most envied man in England. I
wish you every happiness, too, Miss Cluley. Jermyn's a good
fellow and he's been a pretty hard nut to crack from a
matrimonial point of view. Sure I wish you every happiness."</p>

<p>"Did you bring me here, Jermyn," Lucille asked him quietly,
"on purpose to give me this delightful surprise? If so, it was
indeed good of you!"</p>

<p>Jermyn shook his head.</p>

<p>"When I asked you, Lucille," he replied, "I had neither made
up my mind myself nor had I the least idea that Sybil would
accept me."</p>

<p>Lucille looked at him steadily for a moment. Then she turned
away with a little shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>"I wish you both&mdash;what can I say?&mdash;all the
happiness that you deserve," she declared. "There is nothing
more than that, is there?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing more," Jermyn agreed.</p>

<p>"Will Sybil really live here?" Mary inquired, in an awed
tone.</p>

<p>"Whenever she chooses," Jermyn replied. "This will be her
home, at any rate, and yours too, Mary, but we shall have to
have a little corner of our own in town somewhere. If I took
your sister away from her work all at once, I should probably
find myself the most unpopular man in London."</p>

<p>"The new play, then," Lakenham asked, lighting a cigarette
and moving towards the staircase, "will not be postponed?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," Jermyn assured him. "Sybil and I are going
to begin studying it to-night."</p>

<p>The two sisters went up the stairs with their arms around one
another. Jermyn was left alone for a moment with Lucille. Even
he, with his mind full of his new-found happiness, could
scarcely help noticing the change which the last few minutes
seemed to have wrought in his companion.</p>

<p>"You are tired, Lucille," he said, compassionately. "I ought
not to have left you alone with the child for so long."</p>

<p>"It is nothing," she answered. "Your news was just a little
surprising, wasn't it? Tell me, Jermyn, have you had this in
your mind for long?"</p>

<p>"In a way, I have," he admitted, "and in a way, to tell you
the honest truth, I have been fighting against it. I write plays
and I enjoy writing them, but, between ourselves, I hate the
English stage and everything connected with it. I detest the
atmosphere of the green room, I dislike intensely a great many
of the people with whom Sybil has to associate. I always admired
her, and yet, for the reasons I have mentioned, I made up my
mind that I would try and conquer it. You see, I have failed.
Sybil is an honest, sweet, faithful girl, and I should be a fool
to hesitate because I dislike her surroundings. All the more
credit to her for the way she has lived."</p>

<p>Lucille raised her magnificent eyes to his.</p>

<p>"Is there any doubt whatever, Jermyn," she asked, "as to the
way she has lived?"</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. Jermyn winced as though he
had been struck. He drew himself up a little. He seemed suddenly
taller and graver.</p>

<p>"My dear Lucille," he said, "that question from a stranger
would have led to serious consequences. From you I must treat it
as simply the first error in good taste of which I ever remember
you to have been guilty."</p>

<p>She walked away very slowly, without any further word. She
ascended the great stairs, passing with her head erect between
the long lines of those ancestors of his and hers. She had never
realized, perhaps, until that moment how confidently she had
planned some day or other to find her resting place in this
house as its mistress. She had looked upon Jermyn as her certain
possession. He had, if anything, disliked women. She alone had
known how to soothe his fancies, to talk with him on his
favorite subjects, to bring even the admiration sometimes into
his eyes. She had trifled with the thing until it was too late.
Her nails dug into the palms of her hand as she passed along the
corridor, her head thrown back, her cheeks bloodless. There was,
indeed, but one chance. If only Aynesworth could remember!</p>
<hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch05" id="ch05"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="first">"This," Sybil said softly to herself, as she
descended to the drawing-room, "should be one of the happiest
evenings in my life. It shall be!"</p>

<p>Even Lucille, gowned by Paquin and with a European reputation
for smartness, could find no fault with her guest as she entered
the room. Sybil wore a dinner-gown of blue net, which a famous
dressmaker had designed for her, and a large bunch of white
sweet-peas which Jermyn had sent to her room. Her face was
suddenly freed from the little cloud which had sometimes hovered
there during the afternoon. It was as though her great happiness
had triumphed over every anxiety, had finally crushed the
presentiment which had distressed her. She moved joyfully, her
cheeks were pink; her eyes, soft and glowing with excitement,
seemed actually to have increased in size. There was a touch
almost of shyness as she took Jermyn's arm. Somehow or other,
the news seemed to have spread, and the old butler and the other
servants whom they passed on their way to the dining-room, bowed
with a new deference.</p>

<p>"Never since this house was built, dear," Jermyn told her
softly, "has it had so lovely a mistress. You know that we shall
have to spend a great deal of time here?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure," she answered, "that you will ever be able to
get me away. You will have to write like the immortals to
inspire me with ambition."</p>

<p>"Do you know that you are bewitching to-night?" he murmured.
"This afternoon you looked a little tired, almost worried. There
was a frown somewhere upon your forehead, and a dear little line
at the corner of your eyes. You looked at poor Lakenham as
though he were some sort of an ogre. Now your face is like an
April sky after the last drops of rain have fallen."</p>

<p>"It is because my heart is like that," she whispered. "I do
not feel that there is an ugly or an unkind person upon the face
of the earth."</p>

<p>Sybil let herself go from that moment. She was gay, she was
charming, she was joyous. Even Lucille, watching her always from
her place at the end of the table, admitted to herself that this
little girl from the theatres was no unworthy rival. Lord
Lakenham, to whom she talked with a new spirit, and whom she
even rallied gently upon his moroseness during the early stages
of dinner, seemed to change by degrees his whole attitude
towards her. From the suspicious resentment of a man whose
attentions have been slighted, he developed an admiration which
he took no pains to conceal. He vied with Jermyn in gallant
speeches; his eyes followed her all the time. He drank glass
after glass of champagne, and his manner became more and more
unrestrained. Jermyn grew a little reserved toward the end of
the meal. He was glad enough to see the slight antagonism
between Sybil and his cousin removed, but he certainly did not
approve of Lakenham's present attitude.</p>

<p>"Jermyn, old fellow, I'm not sure that you deserve your
luck," Lakenham declared, setting down his empty glass. "You're
a dull stick sometimes, you know. No one would think, to watch
you now, that the prettiest woman in England had just promised
to marry you. If I thought you meant to shut Miss Cluley up here
for the rest of her life, I'd forbid the banns."</p>

<p>"We haven't an idea of anything of the sort," Jermyn assured
him. "On the contrary, Miss Cluley and I are going to begin
studying the new play directly after dinner. You will in all
probability see it produced in October."</p>

<p>"And dull stuff I expect it will be," Lakenham grumbled. "I
used to like Miss Cluley before you got hold of her for your
psychological plays. They're much too clever for me, all of
them. You ought to have stayed in musical comedy, Miss
Cluley."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" she laughed. "You know, I spent all my
time when I was in it praying for the day when managers would
think that I was worth something better."</p>

<p>Lakenham shook his head vigorously.</p>

<p>"All depends upon what you would call something better, of
course. For my part, give me a rattling good musical comedy,
with a jolly good waltz tune, lots of pretty girls in slap-up
frocks, and a principal like you. There's nothing better that I
know of."</p>

<p>"Oh, but there is, really!" Sybil protested. "That may be all
very pretty and graceful but it isn't the real thing."</p>

<p>"And what," Lucille asked calmly, "is the real thing?"</p>

<p>"Not to amuse people," Sybil replied, "but to make them feel.
Laughter, mirth-compelling stories and musical comedies, only
minister to the holiday moments of life. To portray real
emotions, to excite real sympathies, to make people think, to
send them away feeling that they have passed through a little
epitome of life, to break through the crust and make them
conscious for a few moments of the great things&mdash;that seems
to me so much more wonderful."</p>

<p>Jermyn laid his hands upon hers, his eyes glowed with
pleasure.</p>

<p>"That," he declared, "is what we are going to do."</p>

<p>Lakenham laughed long and boisterously.</p>

<p>"If all the pretty actresses in London were to fill their
heads with those ideas," he exclaimed, "half the theatres would
have to close their doors before the season was over, and the
other half wouldn't pay! It won't do, Miss Cluley. The stage in
London, at any rate, wasn't meant for that sort of thing.
Amusement is what we all want, nowadays. We don't want to have
our feelings trifled with after dinner. You were the most divine
Elsa who ever waltzed upon the stage. You'll never do anything
greater than that."</p>

<p>She made a little grimace at him.</p>

<p>"For you, perhaps, no, Lord Lakenham, but then, you see,
there are many people in the world who have other
standards."</p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" Jermyn whispered under his breath. "And now,"
he added, rising, "you have all been warned. There are some
people in the drawing-room who want bridge&mdash;a couple of men
from the barracks who couldn't get over in time to dine, and the
local doctor, who, they tell me, is quite first-class. Miss
Cluley and I are going to read and we mustn't be disturbed upon
any pretext."</p>

<p>Lucille rose slowly to her feet. She paused for a moment as
she passed her host.</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she said quietly, "I do not consider it good taste
on your part to go to your study and shut yourself up with Miss
Cluley."</p>

<p>"My dear Lucille," he protested, "don't you understand? Miss
Cluley came down here simply that we might study my new play
together. She has not seen her part yet and it is to be produced
within three months. There is really not an hour to lose."</p>

<p>Lucille shrugged her shoulders very slightly and passed on
her way out of the room. Jermyn watched her disappear with a
puzzled frown upon his forehead.</p>

<p>"I am not sure," he said to Sybil, as they crossed the hall
together, "that I quite understand Lucille."</p>

<p>"Then you are a goose!" she laughed.</p>

<p>Jermyn's study was the old library of the house, only a
trifle modernized. The book-cases, which reached to the ceiling,
were mellow with age, but the interior of the room, though still
preserving a certain scholarly tone, gave evidences of a more
modern taste. A baby grand piano stood in one corner. There were
guns and fishing rods and cricket bats in evidence. The windows
opened on to the lawn and beyond were the woods, behind which
the moon, slowly rising, was already visible. Jermyn dragged the
writing-table up to the open windows and lit a green-shaded
lamp. Then he placed Sybil by his side in a low chair and took
up the play. Suddenly she held out her white arms to him.</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she whispered, "never mind about the play for a
moment. Tell me, please, tell me now, quickly, that it isn't all
a dream? It's so wonderful that I feel as though I were drawn up
into Heaven, and then sometimes I am afraid!"</p>

<p>Her eyes were large and round and pleading, her voice
trembled, her lips were quivering. Her whole frame seemed shaken
with suppressed feeling. He dropped on one knee by her side.</p>

<p>"Dearest, it is all quite true," he assured her eagerly. "You
know that it is all true. I love you very dearly and you have
promised to be my wife."</p>

<p>She gripped hold of him. There was a nervous strength in her
fingers which held his arms.</p>

<p>"I am so afraid," she murmured, "that something may happen,
that it may all go. Are you sure that you don't
think&mdash;you're not imagining that I'm better, that I'm
cleverer than I am? Tell me that it is I myself, just as I
am&mdash;just as I am here at this moment&mdash;not different in
any way&mdash;whom you love? Tell me that, Jermyn? Make me sure
of it&mdash;make me believe it!"</p>

<p>He held her in his arms. Her heart was beating fast against
his as he kissed her.</p>

<p>"Dear," he answered, "it is indeed you, you just as you are
now, no cleverer, no different, just you whom I love. Nothing
shall come between us. There is nothing in the world which you
need fear."</p>

<p>She gave a deep sigh of content. Nevertheless, she would not
let him go.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are and I will tell you what it is that
troubles me," she went on. "I am a little afraid of you. No,
don't interrupt. You see, all of the men whom I met at the
theatres, the actors and the manager's friends, and the men whom
one meets out&mdash;I don't go often, you know, but sometimes I
have to go to the other girls' houses they are all so different.
They look as though they belonged entirely and altogether to the
world. They are like Lord Lakenham. And you are different. You
are very different, aren't you, Jermyn? Your face is so grave
and quiet sometimes, and you look as though the ordinary things
of life didn't amuse or interest you. You look all the time as
though you were seeking for something better, something better
always. All the time your head is lifted towards the clouds. You
seem to be listening for the music that comes from Heaven. And I
am on the earth, Jermyn&mdash;I am so very much upon the earth t
I can't get my feet away from it. I am afraid that I may not see
what you see!"</p>

<p>"You silly child," he answered, consolingly. "If I am just a
little different from the others, well, it isn't anything in the
least to be afraid of. It simply hasn't amused me to lead the
ordinary London life. I have loved my books; I have loved to
study a little. I am fond of the country and country
sports&mdash;so will you be in time. But don't believe for a
moment, please, that I am a prig. I think I really do know the
value of things. I want to come nearer to you, just as much as I
want to draw you a little nearer to me. It's humanity I want to
study, dear, and you'll help me, I know. If I was a little quiet
at dinner-time, well, you must forgive me. Lakenham was making
rather an ass of himself, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>She held him once more tightly in her arms.</p>

<p>"I never dreamed that this would come to me," she said
softly, "but now that it has come I couldn't bear to lose you.
It's been so hard, the last few years, Jermyn. I've tried almost
to shut myself up lately, but there have always been men whom
one meets somehow or other, and they have come, and before I
have talked to them for an afternoon or an evening they begin
the same old foolish, insincere, artificial love-making, just
because I am Sybil Cluley, I suppose, a little girl on the
comedy stage. I've wanted friends so often and the women are
very scarce who would know me and whom I would care to know, and
even the nice men, whom I would like to have been friendly with,
always began to try to pay me compliments and imagine things,
instead of treating me like a reasonable human being. I was
getting tired of it all, tired to death, Jermyn, and I was so
lonely. And then you came, and now everything is wonderful. I
don't feel, somehow, that I have any right to be as happy as I
am, and yet I don't feel that I could bear it if it didn't
last."</p>

<p>He smiled at her confidently.</p>

<p>"Do I feel like a dream, dear?" he asked. "Do you think that
I could fade away? I am a very solid, human man, and I love you
far too much to give you up&mdash;ever."</p>

<p>She drew a long sigh of content.</p>

<p>"If you are sure," she said; "if you are quite, quite
sure&mdash;well, then, we will begin the play."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch06" id="ch06"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="first">The last page of the manuscript was turned. The
moon now was clear of the tree tops, yellow and luminous in the
midsummer sky. A little breeze was rustling among the firs, a
breeze which brought through the open French-windows occasional
wafts of spicy perfume from the flower-gardens. Sybil's eyes
were glowing, but she was very quiet.</p>

<p>"It is wonderful," she whispered. "It is really wonderful,
Jermyn. And yet, I am so sorry."</p>

<p>"Sorry?"</p>

<p>She wiped the tears from her eyes.</p>

<p>"I am sorry for the woman&mdash;for 'Nora'&mdash;for the
woman who will be myself."</p>

<p>"She deceived her husband," he said, a little sternly. "She
lied to her friend."</p>

<p>"But there was a reason," she reminded him eagerly. "She
didn't do it for her own sake. Every evil thing she did was to
save another from suffering."</p>

<p>"She broke her word," Jermyn remarked calmly. "There isn't
any excuse in this world for a woman who deliberately breaks her
word."</p>

<p>"No excuse!" she repeated, her eyes still holding his.</p>

<p>"None! Can't you see that what she did in that first act was
like a black spot upon her life? She was never the same
afterwards. She lost her self-respect. The lie that followed
seemed almost natural to her. The moment she let go of the
absolute truth she began to sink."</p>

<p>"But she was tempted she was horribly tempted, and women are
so weak when they are lonely," Sybil reminded him,
tearfully.</p>

<p>He smiled at her.</p>

<p>"Dear," he said, "of course she was tempted. If there was no
temptation, how could there be any sin? A man is judged not by
the number of his sins but by the number of temptations which he
has overcome. Sinlessness in a person who has encountered
absolutely no temptation is scarcely even a quality; it is a
necessary condition of existence. Now tell me really what you
think of your part?"</p>

<p>"If I can ever play it," she replied, "it will be my
best."</p>

<p>"You really mean that?"</p>

<p>"I do," she insisted. "I honestly do. And yet, because I am
so sure of it I am a little afraid. I believe that I could play
the part of 'Nora' so that I could bring tears to the eyes of
every woman who understands, and of every man who loves the
woman who understands. Oh, I know what 'Nora' was. But then she
was human, so human that I am afraid. She is like me just like
me."</p>

<p>Jermyn laughed reassuringly.</p>

<p>"And why shouldn't you be human, dear," he answered, stooping
towards her, "adorably, wonderfully human? And I wouldn't have
you anything else. Bring your little faults with you, dear, and
I'll love them. Now let's put the play away for a time. It's all
rather emotional, isn't it, and I don't want you to be
overstrung. I wonder if you know what you are really like,
little lady? Look here."</p>

<p>He drew an illustrated paper towards him and turned over the
pages.</p>

<p>"It only arrived this evening," he said, "so I don't suppose
you have seen it. The photograph you know, of course, but did
you ever see such a lovely reproduction? I think that I shall
frame it just as it is. It is softer and more beautiful even
than the photograph itself."</p>

<p>He showed her the full-length picture of herself. She looked
at it approvingly.</p>

<p>"Am I really as nice as that?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Nicer by far," he assured her, smiling. "There are qualities
in your face, dear, which no photographer could ever know
anything about. And do you see what a wonderful person you are?
Two pages&mdash;biography or interview or something. Nobody ever
wanted to interview me at that length."</p>

<p>She leaned over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"You stupid person!" she declared. "As though you could
possibly compare us!"</p>

<p>"I am not jealous," he laughed, "but there's no illustrated
paper could find as much to say about me. Here you are.
Born&mdash;gracious, you're twenty-three years old!&mdash;no,
twenty-four! Stock companies for so long, musical comedies so
long, your first great success a fluke. You were
playing&mdash;why, what's the matter, Sybil? What is it,
dear?"</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly and looked at her in amazement. A
hoarse little cry had broken from her lips; the color was fading
from her cheeks. She was gazing intently at the page from which
he had been idly quoting.</p>

<p>"It's there!" she cried. "There!"</p>

<p>Jermyn looked from the paper to her, and back again.</p>

<p>"What's there?" he asked. "Sybil, I don't understand."</p>

<p>She opened her lips and closed them again. Her eyes were
still distended, the fingers of one hand were clutching his
shoulder. She was reading a certain paragraph. He followed her
eyes. There was nothing to be read except the ordinary story, a
few simple facts of her earlier career. She had been playing in
stock companies at Blackpool when she was compelled to give up
her position and go to London to take her sister to a hospital.
While she was waiting for an operation to take place, a small
part was offered to her at the last moment in a London
production. She was the success of the play. From that moment
she had never looked back.</p>

<p>"What on earth is wrong with it, dear?" he persisted. "I
can't see anything, not a line, that you should not be proud
of."</p>

<p>She was beginning to recover herself. Her cheeks, though,
were still ivory white. Even her lips were almost bloodless.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;isn't anything," she faltered. "Forgive me, I am
just a little hysterical. Seeing it all down there made me think
of my struggles, of those early days! It was hard work,
Jermyn."</p>

<p>"My dear!" he said, consolingly. "You mustn't! Those days are
all over and done with now. If you think of them at all, you
should think of them with pride. You should be as proud of
yourself as I am of you to think that you fought your way
through everything, alone and unhelped."</p>

<p>"Is there another of those papers in the house?" she
asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Not that I know of."</p>

<p>She deliberately tore a page out and thrust it into the bosom
of her gown.</p>

<p>"I don't want people to read this and make fun of me," she
said. "Keep the rest of it here. Don't let any one see it."</p>

<p>"No one will come in here, dear," he promised. "Of course, I
think you're a foolish little girl. I should be very proud of
that biography, if I were you. Now don't let's think any more of
it, though. We'd better go across into the drawing-room and say
good-night. I think I shall pack you off to bed. Do you know
that it's nearly eleven o'clock?"</p>

<p>She rose to her feet. All the life and spirits of a few hours
ago seemed to have gone. Once more the little wrinkle was there
by her eyes. She seemed all the time to be thinking.</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she asked, "how long is Lord Lakenham going to stay
here?"</p>

<p>"He is off to-morrow or the next day, I think," Jermyn
replied, "unless you have turned his head completely. You seem
to have got over your dislike of him," he added, smiling. "A
very little more and I should have been jealous."</p>

<p>She shuddered.</p>

<p>"Jealous of Lord Lakenham! No, I don't think so, Jermyn! Will
you promise me something?"</p>

<p>"To-night, dear," he answered, "I will promise you
anything."</p>

<p>"If he wants to stay, don't let him. If you can get rid of
him to-morrow, let him go."</p>

<p>"You foolish child!" Jermyn laughed. "I can't turn him out at
a moment's notice if he wants to stay. There isn't any plausible
reason for it. But if you make a point of it, I'll insist upon
his clearing out the day afterwards. I don't think you need have
any fear, though. There can't be anything for him to do here and
he always needs a good deal of amusement."</p>

<p>She looked behind at the illustrated paper lying upon the
table.</p>

<p>"You don't think that any one will come in here, Jermyn?" she
whispered.</p>

<p>"No one, dear," he answered. "Now before we go out I want you
to give me one kiss, and then I am going to ask you just one
question."</p>

<p>She held up her lips.</p>

<p>"The question first?" she begged.</p>

<p>He held her tightly.</p>

<p>"There are never going to be any secrets between us," he said
softly; "never any secrets or the shadow of a secret. Why don't
you want Lord Lakenham to see that paper?"</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch07" id="ch07"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="first">Jermyn entered the smoking-room about half an
hour later, and found Lakenham installed in one easy-chair with
his feet upon another, a large brandy-and-soda by his side, and
a pipe of bulldog pattern in his mouth, from which he was
emitting columns of smoke with an air of great satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I say, Jermyn, is Miss Cluley better?" he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>Jermyn nodded. He brought himself a whisky-and-soda from the
sideboard and drew up an easy-chair towards his guest.</p>

<p>"Yes, she seems all right now," he announced. "It was just an
ordinary fainting fit. I suppose she came down here really
rather strung up. That acting night after night must be a strain
upon any one."</p>

<p>"Can't see how they do it," Lakenham confessed. "Must be
working on their nerves all the time. Queer thing when you come
to think of it, though, to go off in a faint like that without a
moment's notice."</p>

<p>Jermyn was looking grave and worried.</p>

<p>"It frightened me," he admitted. "However, she seems quite
all right now. I suppose it has been rather an exciting day for
her, and just as we were leaving the study I asked her a
question which seemed to upset her a little. I ought to have
left that sort of thing alone&mdash;for to-day, at any
rate."</p>

<p>Lakenham looked thoughtfully at his pipe.</p>

<p>"Yes, I dare say she's found it a bit exciting," he remarked.
"No doubt she gets plenty of offers of marriage, but we can
guess the kind of people they come from as a rule&mdash;
stage-struck boys, actors, and hangers-on at the theatre&mdash;any
one who comes within the glamour; not to speak of the adventurers,
who've got an eye on her salary. I was a bit of a fool that way
myself in my younger days, but my tendencies weren't
matrimonial, fortunately. It's certainly a great day for Miss
Cluley."</p>

<p>Jermyn turned his head slightly and regarded his guest with
level eyebrows.</p>

<p>"I consider it also," he said slowly, "a great day for me. I
have the utmost respect and admiration for Miss Cluley, apart
from the feelings which have prompted me to ask her to become my
wife."</p>

<p>Lakenham knocked the ashes from his pipe slowly.</p>

<p>"You're a bit high-flown in your notions for me, Jermyn," he
declared. "I've no doubt you know a good deal more about the
young lady than I do, but if I were to become engaged to a young
lady from the theatres who has had as much admiration as Miss
Cluley, I shouldn't start by expecting too much. What I do say,"
he went on, his eyes becoming a shade brighter, "is that she's
the most fascinating little creature I ever saw in all my days.
Just the sort of girl to turn a man inside out. To-night at
dinner-time she was irresistible, simply irresistible."</p>

<p>He seemed to have forgotten that his pipe was already empty.
He went on tapping it against the ashtray by his side, with his
eyes fixed upon the carpet.</p>

<p>"I have knocked about a bit in Paris and Vienna, and I know
New York," he continued, talking as though half to himself, "but
I never in the course of all my days saw a more charming, a more
fascinating little object than she was to-night, with her
quaint little graces and that smile and her exquisite figure.
She has all the Eve tricks, you know, Jermyn."</p>

<p>Jermyn stiffened perceptibly.</p>

<p>"I find Miss Cluley exceedingly natural," he said. "That, to
my mind, is one of her chief charms. By the bye, Aynesworth, you
are about so much in London and you make such a point of being a
figure in theatrical society, that I rather wonder you never met
her."</p>

<p>"I rather wonder at it myself," Lakenham assented. "If I had
only known&mdash;but there, it's too late now. You see, she was
never to be met with at the musical comedy dances or that sort
of shows. I think she knows her value, that young lady."</p>

<p>"Lucille was talking to me for a moment," Jermyn continued,
"after we had taken Miss Cluley upstairs. She seemed to think
that you were puzzled about her, that you had a sort of idea
that you had met her somewhere before."</p>

<p>Lakenham was silent for a time.</p>

<p>"Between ourselves, Jermyn," he admitted, "it's a funny
thing, but the idea haunts me. You know, I have knocked about a
lot," he went on, confidentially. "The number of girls I've
flirted with would make up one of the bulkiest albums that was
ever bound. Nature didn't bless me with brains like you, Jermyn.
Women and sport have been my hobbies. Yes, I can see that little
curl of your lips, but I am honest, at any rate. It may seem to
you an ignoble sort of confession but it's the truth. Now
somewhere back in my memory there's a little cell that I can't
see into, and in that cell there's a memory, and the memory has
something to do with that&mdash;that fascinating little witch
upstairs. All day long I've been struggling with it, struggling
to remember. The thing's becoming almost a torture to me. And
this is the funny part of it, Jermyn, since we are on the
subject. She won't admit it, she probably wouldn't admit it even
if you asked her, but she knows."</p>

<p>Jermyn walked across the room for a moment and stood at the
open window. The moon now was almost overhead. Against the black
fir trees, the deep blue of the sky and the brilliancy of the
stars seemed extraordinarily vivid. It was a still, soft night,
absolutely silent save for the buzzing of a huge insect
attracted by the lights. As he stood there, Jermyn was conscious
of his first moment of actual depression. Was he really, as all
these people were so ready to hint, an idealist, a dreamer led
by his love of beauty to keep his head willfully upraised, the
victim of his own sensitiveness to such an extent that he
refused even to see flaws in the things which he worshiped?
After all, it was a very ordinary world in which he lived. Was
it incumbent upon him to accept its standards? Then a moment
later he was ashamed of himself. From his first meeting with
Sybil there had never been a single second when he had doubted
her. He had been in those days absolutely without prejudice or
preference. His intuition had started him fairly, surely his
instinct was to be trusted for the rest! He thought of her
simple life, her careful avoidance of all the excesses and
vulgarities into which she was so continually tempted; her care
for her sister, their devotion for one another. When he came
back into the room he was himself again. He was ashamed of that
one moment of vacillation. He knew that this man who was
responsible for it was himself the incarnation of the other
things.</p>

<p>"Aynesworth," he said, "with reference to that memory which
you say is eluding you, I should like you to understand
something. You are a man of the world; I am not. I have asked
Sybil Cluley to be my wife, and having done that I have placed
everything I have to offer of myself and my life and my honor,
in her hands. These things are not affected by circumstances. Do
you follow me?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm hanged if I do!" Lakenham replied, striking a match
and lighting his second pipe. "You've asked her to marry you all
right, but if you were to find out that she was&mdash;"</p>

<p>He shrank suddenly back in his place. The words which he had
been about to use carelessly enough seemed choked in his throat.
The fire in Jermyn's eyes was like the flash of a rapier.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," Jermyn interrupted, quietly. "You had better
let me finish. You say yourself that I am a crank. Perhaps in
worldly things I am to some extent. Yet I would like you to
understand this. I have made up my mind to live my life
according to my own ideas, and not according to the accepted
ideas of the world. For that reason I began my little speech to
you. For that reason it will be better for me to conclude it
before you say anything which might make it impossible for me to
receive you any longer under my roof. If anything should come to
you so that that cell in your memory was no longer obscured, I
want you to understand this. I decline to hear anything which
you may remember concerning Miss Cluley. I decline to hear
anything whatever about her except from her own lips, and from
her own lips I have heard all that I choose to know. Is that
clear?"</p>

<p>Lakenham, whose pipe was now going to his satisfaction,
nodded with a subdued air of compassion.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's all right, Jermyn," he declared. "Lord love you,
we're all made differently, aren't we? The only trouble is that
I seem to be made to fit into this world, but the Lord knows
where you'd find one to suit your notions!"</p>

<p>Jermyn smiled as he rose to his feet and threw away the end
of his cigarette.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," he said, "half the people you pass by in
the world are living somewhere in a little garden, or a
wilderness, perhaps, of their own making. We can see no more
than they care to show us of their lives. We may think that they
are pressing on side by side with you or with me. They aren't
really. We needn't, you know, unless we like. Good night! I'll
leave you to finish your pipe."</p>

<p>"Good night, old fellow," Lakenham answered, with a sigh.
"God bless my soul!" he added to himself, as the door
closed.</p>

<p>Jermyn found Lucille with her foot upon the stairs, looking
doubtfully at the clock.</p>

<p>"Of course, these hours of yours, my dear host," she
protested, "are too awful!"</p>

<p>"What on earth are you grumbling at?" Jermyn replied,
smiling. "It's midnight and you've had four rubbers of
bridge."</p>

<p>He had paused by her side. She moved a little nearer to him,
as though by accident. Her eyes and lips were very close to his.
In his present state he was, of course, almost hopeless, but she
was a past mistress in the small subtleties of her sex and she
had great faith in propinquity. She knew, also, that she was
beautiful.</p>

<p>"You dear, primitive person," she whispered. "I hate to go to
bed before three or four o'clock, and the bridge was too awful.
Your doctor was the only man who could play a card, and he
didn't know auction. Really, I think I am the most self-denying
person in the world to do this for you&mdash;for many
reasons."</p>

<p>Jermyn was a trifle uncomfortable without knowing why.</p>

<p>"It was very nice of you to come, Lucille," he said. "Still,
you proposed it yourself, didn't you, and somehow or other I
always seem to rely upon you if I want any one to do me a
kindness."</p>

<p>She looked at him with a little petulant frown.</p>

<p>"My dear boy," she exclaimed, "you do ask such strange
kindnesses. Now something elderly, with a cat and a dead husband
and cameo ornaments, would have done just as well as I."</p>

<p>"But I don't know anything of that sort," he objected.
"Besides, you wanted to come for a few days."</p>

<p>"I wanted to come, it is true," she admitted, "but not
exactly under these conditions. Harrod's or Whiteley's would
have supplied exactly what you wanted. Really, I feel that I am
wasted, besides being quite unnecessary, I am sure. Your
beautiful Miss Cluley is the soul of propriety, isn't she, and
you always say that your life is directed without any regard to
other people's opinions."</p>

<p>"There are certain conventions," he replied, "which one owes
it to one's future wife to observe."</p>

<p>She yawned.</p>

<p>"Every now and then, Jermyn," she declared, "you make me
wonder why you are not a worse prig than you are. In any case
it's too late for a discussion of this sort. If you were really
grateful, really conscious of your responsibilities as my host,
you would do your best to entertain me for an hour&mdash;sit
with me in the garden, perhaps, and tell me about your new
play...No? Well, then, I shall go in and make poor Aynesworth
entertain me for a few minutes. I can't think of a more
satisfactory way of getting sleepy than to listen to him
talk."</p>

<p>"You'll find him in the smoking-room in a typical attitude,"
Jermyn remarked, smiling. "Good night, Lucille!"</p>

<p>He raised her hand to his lips their old form of salute. The
fingers were very cold and she leaned just a little towards
him.</p>

<p>"There was a time&mdash;" she whispered.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"Don't flirt with me, please, Lucille," he begged, moving up
the stairs. "I am in far too susceptible a frame of mind."</p>

<p>She stood with one foot upon the bottom stair, her hand upon
the banisters, watching him ascend. He passed out of sight
without turning his head. Then very slowly she crossed the hall
once more and entered the smoking-room.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch08" id="ch08"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="first">Lakenham had discovered a copy of the
<i>Sporting Times</i>, which he threw down at once, however, at
Lucille's entrance.</p>

<p>"Good girl!" he exclaimed. "Come and restore my drooping
spirits. I am feeling like a naughty boy left here all alone.
Dear Jermyn doesn't approve of me. He's given me a little moral
lecture and gone off to bed."</p>

<p>"I met him on the stairs," Lucille remarked. "He treated me
in very much the same fashion."</p>

<p>"Fellow won't listen to reason," Lakenham grumbled. "I did no
more than remind him that this fascinating little mortal whom
he's fallen in love with belongs to the world of easier ways
than his. He went and looked at the stars for about five minutes
and came back like an archbishop."</p>

<p>"The trouble of it is," Lucille declared, taking the chair
which Jermyn had vacated and helping herself to a cigarette from
the gold case which hung from her chatelaine; "the trouble of it
is that Jermyn <i>au fond</i> is the most pig-headed individual
that ever breathed. He is up in the clouds now. Heavens, how he
irritates me!"</p>

<p>She seldom studied appearances before Lakenham. Her face
seemed to have grown harder and colder. She was smoking quickly,
frowning all the time.</p>

<p>"Can't think how it is that the fellow attracts you at all,"
he said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Neither can I, and yet he does," she replied. "No wonder you
see it. Every one can see it except Jermyn himself. Here have I
come all the way from Dinard to try and get a few days alone
with him down here, and I find myself compelled to sit at the
head of his table and play propriety for his little actress.
Why, in Heaven's name, doesn't he behave like an ordinary mortal
and keep her where she belongs! Upon my word, if only I had the
heart to laugh, it's the most absurd situation that any one
could possibly devise!"</p>

<p>"No doing anything with Jermyn," Lakenham said, decidedly.
"He's got it in the neck. Fairly bowled over. You wouldn't
believe the rot he talked to me just now, after he'd been out
moon-gazing. I don't know what it all meant except that he'd
marry the girl even if she turned out one of the worst."</p>

<p>"He thinks he would," Lucille remarked, "but he wouldn't
really, you know. The trouble of it is that the girl herself has
been so clever. Apart from that elusive memory of yours, which I
am beginning to hate, I suppose you never heard anything at the
club or anywhere about her?"</p>

<p>"Not a single word," Lakenham declared.</p>

<p>"And the memory?"</p>

<p>"Blank as ever," he answered gloomily.</p>

<p>Lucille knocked the ash from her cigarette.</p>

<p>"Aynesworth," she said, turning a little towards him, "I am
used to having my own way in life. I want to upset this
marriage."</p>

<p>"So do I," he replied, bluntly.</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"You? But why? Where do you come in?"</p>

<p>He smoked in stolid silence for several moments. Again that
rather curious light shone in his dull eyes.</p>

<p>"Never mind," he muttered shortly. "It isn't necessary to
tell you. I want to upset it. I would if I could."</p>

<p>She leaned back in her chair and laughed softly.</p>

<p>"After all," she murmured, "I am glad I came. The situation
is improving. I am no longer in the limelight as the central
fool. Oh, my dear Aynesworth, Heaven bless you for this!"</p>

<p>He looked at her suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Don't understand what you're getting at," he declared.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't," she answered, wiping her eyes. "I'll ask you
no questions. If I guess, that must be proof of my wonderful
woman's sagacity. Now about that little illusion of yours. There
is something which it is just possible might help."</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"You know that an hour or so ago Sybil Cluley fainted at the
door of Jermyn's study as they were coming away?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that," he admitted. "I never saw a fellow so
scared in my life as poor old Jermyn was."</p>

<p>"Girls don't faint for nothing, as a rule," Lucille
continued. "While you two were safe in here, I have been
spending a few minutes in the study."</p>

<p>"Find anything?"</p>

<p>"There was an illustrated paper face downwards upon the
writing-table," Lucille told him. "It was open at a photograph
of Sybil Cluley, but part of the next page, which contained an
interview and an account of her life, was torn out. It had
evidently been willfully destroyed."</p>

<p>Lord Lakenham sat quite still, blinking quickly.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"It occurred to me," Lucille went on softly, "that in that
interview you might find something which would give you an idea,
which would perhaps help that little memory of yours to life. It
seems all the more probable, doesn't it, when you consider that
some one&mdash;Sybil Cluley herself, of course&mdash;during the
time that they were in the study together, had deliberately torn
out that page."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" Lakenham said slowly, sitting up in his chair.
"Are there any more illustrated papers in the house?"</p>

<p>"There is another copy of the same one in the drawing-room,"
she answered. "I was on my way to get it when I met Jermyn on
the stairs. Ring the bell."</p>

<p>Lakenham sprang up with unusual alacrity and did as he was
bidden.</p>

<p>"Bring me some seltzer if you have any," he ordered the
servant.</p>

<p>"And will you bring me the <i>Tatler</i> from the
drawing-room," Lucille added, "and any other illustrated papers
you can find?"</p>

<p>"Very good, madame," the man replied.</p>

<p>Lakenham remained standing. The hand which held his pipe
shook a little. Lucille was watching him curiously.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose there's anything in it," he said, half to
himself. "She wouldn't let them put anything in the papers that
she wanted kept dark. Still, it's an idea...Why the dickens
doesn't the fellow come back!"</p>

<p>Lucille laughed at him from the depths of her chair. Her eyes
were fixed upon his face. She saw the slight twitching at the
corners of his mouth, the movement of his hands.</p>

<p>"Really," she murmured, "this new development almost
reconciles me to my share in the comedy!"</p>

<p>The man returned presently, bearing three illustrated papers
upon a salver. As soon as he had left the room they carried them
to a side table. Lakenham turned over the pages of the first
with clumsy fingers. They reached the picture of Sybil. He
looked at it for a moment with a curiously intent expression.
Then he turned the page greedily over. Lucille gave a little
cry.</p>

<p>"The page is missing!" she exclaimed. "It has been cut
out!"</p>

<p>"It's gone, right enough," he echoed, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"It's the same page that was missing from the <i>Tatler</i>,
the one I left in the study!" she cried. "I was right, then.
Look at the others quickly."</p>

<p>Lakenham spread them out upon the table. His thick fingers
were trembling. The result was as they had expected. In each
case the interview was missing. Lucille smiled triumphantly. Her
eyes were suddenly ablaze.</p>

<p>"After all," she murmured, "I think, my dear Aynesworth, that
we shall be able to call that little memory of yours to
life!"</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch09" id="ch09"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="first">Six thoroughly exhausted people lay stretched
upon the lawn in various more or less picturesque attitudes.
Mary, with two boys at her feet, was fanning herself with a
large panama hat and holding a little court of her own.</p>

<p>"I say, Miss Mary," one of the boys declared, "those are
stunning leg breaks of yours&mdash;best I ever stood up to from
a girl. Where did you learn to bowl them?"</p>

<p>"At school, I suppose, but they came quite naturally to me,"
Mary answered, modestly. "But what's the good? I can't get him
out."</p>

<p>She moved her head towards the spot where Jermyn was lying at
his ease by Sybil's side. The boy who had spoken first
laughed.</p>

<p>"Why, Sir Jermyn's a county cricketer!" he exclaimed in an
awed tone. "He made a hundred against Kent only the week before
last. Get him out, indeed! Why, Fielder and Carr and all of them
were trying as hard as they could for two hours and a quarter,
and he simply did what he liked with them."</p>

<p>"Which reminds me," Jermyn remarked, lifting his head a few
inches, "when am I going to get the rest of my innings?"</p>

<p>"Whenever," Mary replied, deliberately, "you are ready to bat
with one hand and left-handed. Unless you do that I shall not
bowl at you again. It puts me off worse to be placed than to be
knocked about."</p>

<p>Jermyn sighed.</p>

<p>"It seems a little unfair," he grumbled. "All through this
afternoon I have had to watch my most cunning deliveries treated
entirely without respect by you, young lady, and now, when my
time for revenge has come&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I only made fifteen and you were in for a quarter of an
hour," Mary interrupted. "Your side won, anyway."</p>

<p>Jermyn was looking down the avenue. Far away in the distance
was a little cloud of dust.</p>

<p>"What on earth is that?" he exclaimed. "It doesn't look large
enough for a car."</p>

<p>"Motor bicycle," one of the boys replied. "Isn't he ripping
along, too!"</p>

<p>Jermyn frowned slightly.</p>

<p>"I hate the sight of the things," he declared, "and of the
fellows who ride them. They all look as though they had escaped
from some other planet."</p>

<p>Lakenham had suddenly risen from his prone position upon the
grass, and was sitting upright. Exercise seemed scarcely to have
agreed with him. The flush upon his cheeks was almost purple and
his forehead was still bathed in perspiration.</p>

<p>"It's my man," he said. "Sorry his hobby offends your
aesthetic taste, Jermyn, but it's the fellow's one weakness. He
will bring that wretched machine along wherever he goes. Comes
in useful sometimes, though. He's been in to Norwich for me
to-day."</p>

<p>"To Norwich?" Jermyn repeated. "What on earth did you want to
send him there for?"</p>

<p>Lakenham did not at once reply. With some effort he struggled
to his feet and brushed the fir needles from his white flannel
clothes. He was smiling very slightly to himself, but it was a
smile which did not improve his appearance. His eyes seemed to
have grown smaller, to have receded further into his head. The
sensual curve of his lips had become a cruel one. Sybil, who
happened to glance across at him at that moment, shivered. Was
it her fancy, she wondered, or was there really anything
significant in the fact that he looked steadily at her before he
replied?</p>

<p>"Something I wanted and he offered to fetch for me. He thinks
nothing of thirty or forty miles on that thing. I'll go in and
have a word with him."</p>

<p>"Help me up first, Aynesworth," Lucille ordered. "I, too, am
going into the house. Something is coming. I don't know what it
is but it looks disagreeable."</p>

<p>Lucille had not been playing cricket. Notwithstanding the
simplicity of her white lace gown and her large picture hat, she
seemed somehow, by the perfection of her toilette, its slightly
foreign note, perhaps, to be in some degree removed from any
kinship with the others. She looked as though she had stepped
out of some wonderful French picture of modern life; as though
she belonged, indeed, to a more artificial world whose standards
of beauty were more precise. Mary was watching her
curiously.</p>

<p>"Isn't she beautiful!" she whispered to one of the boys.</p>

<p>"Ripping!" the boy agreed. "I think your sister's
better-looking, though. Besides, she can run about almost as well
as you can, and she can throw quite decently. I don't think the
Duchess could run far in those clothes."</p>

<p>Mary rewarded him with a glance.</p>

<p>"There isn't anybody quite like Sybil," she admitted. "The
Duchess, though, looks so much like a picture."</p>

<p>Lucille pointed with the tip of her parasol to the
landscape.</p>

<p>"What is this that is coming upon us, Jermyn?" she asked. "I
am beginning to shiver already."</p>

<p>A faint white mist had come rolling up across the park and
was stretched like a semi-transparent veil across the blue sky.
The sun, which had been blazing down upon them only a few
minutes ago, was now half obscured, a great crimson ball whose
fierce heat was suddenly tempered.</p>

<p>"It's just a North Sea mist," Jermyn told her. "It won't
last. We get them now and then in the middle of summer."</p>

<p>"I do not find it pleasant," Lucille decided. "I shall go
indoors."</p>

<p>She moved slowly across the lawn towards the open door
through which Lakenham had already vanished. Sybil, whose eyes
followed her until she had disappeared, suddenly shivered.
Jermyn, who was secretly holding her hand, realized that it had
grown colder. He sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"You are chilly!" he exclaimed. "Shall we go in?"</p>

<p>"It was only for a moment," she assured him. "This mist
looked so weird coming in the middle of a hot afternoon. Do you
see how strangely it seems to hang about the trees?"</p>

<p>"It will have gone in a few minutes," he declared, looking at
her a little anxiously. "Shall we go into the library? Or would
you like to try the conservatories? You'll find it hot enough
there."</p>

<p>She was looking once more at the open door, through which
first Lord Lakenham and now Lucille had passed. She shook her
head slowly.</p>

<p>"No," she murmured, "let us stay here. I like to be out of
doors, only I think that I should like to walk for a minute. I
am stiff."</p>

<p>Jermyn pulled her to her feet. The brilliant color of a few
minutes ago had certainly left her cheeks. She looked very pale
and very slight in her white flannel dress and shirt with the
low collar.</p>

<p>"What a child you are!" he laughed, as he drew her arm
through his. "Are you always so susceptible to impressions?"</p>

<p>She drew quite close to him. She pressed his arm as though
the touch of it gave her confidence.</p>

<p>"I am not always so queer," she whispered softly, "only
somehow or other these last few hours seem too wonderful. I
can't realize&mdash;I try and I try but it seems almost
impossible. I am afraid," she went on, raising her head slowly
and looking at him; "I am afraid of having them snatched away. I
seem to be searching everywhere for omens. The mist almost
frightened me. It was such a sudden change&mdash;one moment the
sunshine, the blue sky, the butterflies, the humming of bees,
and another moment nothing&mdash;just a cold, gray mist. It
frightened me. And&mdash;and Lord Lakenham&mdash;why did he
stare at me like that?"</p>

<p>Jermyn looked at her as one might look at an imaginative
child.</p>

<p>"I am sorry that you dislike Aynesworth so much," he said.
"It is shocking bad luck that he happened to be here at
all."</p>

<p>"He isn't staying&mdash;much longer, is he?"</p>

<p>"He is off to-morrow, I believe," Jermyn replied. "To tell
you the honest truth," he added, "I am rather glad you dislike
him, for the way he looks at you sometimes makes me feel
inclined to kick him."</p>

<p>She shuddered.</p>

<p>"I used to think that I could never really hate anybody," she
continued, "but I do hate Lord Lakenham. He seems to me like
some one who ought not to be alive. If I were to hear to-morrow
that he was dead, I should be glad glad!"</p>

<p>"My dear Sybil!"</p>

<p>"I cannot help it!" she went on, with a little note of
passion throbbing in her tone. "I have that feeling about him. I
never thought that I was cruel, I never felt cruel before, but I
wish he were dead! I should be glad if he were dead! Tell me why
you are looking like that, Jermyn? Tell me exactly what you are
thinking?"</p>

<p>"Shall I?"</p>

<p>"You simply must," she insisted.</p>

<p>"I was wondering," he told her, "if Lakenham were in any way
connected with that mysterious part of your biography which it
so terrified you to see in the <i>Tatler</i>?"</p>

<p>She seemed suddenly to become once more like a creature of
stone. Her whisper scarcely reached his ears.</p>

<p>"You are wondering that?"</p>

<p>"Doesn't it seem reasonable?" he asked. "Your dislike of him
is a little extreme, isn't it? You must have met many men of his
type. You have not wished them all dead."</p>

<p>She drew her arm quietly away from his.</p>

<p>"You are right," she said slowly. "Lord Lakenham is connected
with what you call that mysterious part of my biography. Take me
somewhere, Jermyn, where we can be really alone, and I'll tell
you I'll tell you although I don't think that the world will
ever be quite the same place to me again."</p>

<p>He shook his head, looking at her all the time with a smile
upon his lips and a look in his eyes which are the things a
woman craves for more than anything in the world from the man
she loves.</p>

<p>"You baby!" he murmured. "I haven't the least curiosity. It
wouldn't interest me in the slightest. Why do you put yourself
through such a purgatory of imaginings? Nothing that you could
say or could tell me would make the slightest difference.
Nothing can alter what you are, what I know that you are. You
see, I am conceited enough to believe absolutely in myself as
well as in you. Let us steal off into the library and have tea
there alone. All these young people will do very well without
us. We have heaps of plans to make yet."</p>

<p>They had strolled across the lawn on to one of the garden
paths. She looked at him for a moment with an eagerness which
had in it something almost fierce. Then she broke into a little
peal of laughter&mdash;real, natural, delightful laughter. She
was once more herself; her eyes besought him, tantalized
him.</p>

<p>"If only they couldn't see us," she whispered, "and you
weren't so tall!"</p>

<p>He took a skillful turn to the left.</p>

<p>"These laurel bushes," he assured her, "are as dense as a
brick wall, and as regards my height&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her arms were around his neck, holding him tighter and
tighter. He was amazed at their strength.</p>

<p>"You won't let me go you&mdash;won't ever let me go?" she
pleaded.</p>

<p>He took her boldly into his arms.</p>

<br>

<p>"Dear," he answered, "there isn't anything in this world or
any other world that shall take you out of my life or out of my
heart!"</p>

<p>The mist passed. Once more the sunshine streamed down upon
them. As they crossed the lawn, half an hour later, they met
Lucille slowly emerging from the house. She stood looking at
them with the shadow of a strange smile upon her lips.</p>

<p>"So the grayness has all passed away," she remarked, "and we
are going to have tea out here after all. What can have happened
to Aynesworth, I wonder? He looks like a big boy chuckling over
some huge joke."</p>

<p>Lakenham was certainly looking immensely pleased with
himself. He was standing upon the lawn with a whisky-and-soda in
one hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other. His legs
were a little apart. He was looking over towards Jermyn and
Sybil with the satisfied smile of a man who has accomplished
something worth doing.</p>

<p>"You look," Jermyn said, "as though you had received good
news."</p>

<p>Lakenham threw back his head and a moment later set down his
empty tumbler.</p>

<p>"I have," he replied,&mdash;"the best! Miss Cluley, you've
lost all your color. Jermyn makes you do too much."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that the cricket was a little exhausting,"
Jermyn admitted. "After tea I think we'll let those youngsters
look after themselves."</p>

<p>"We want you to play tennis," Mary begged,&mdash;"you and I
against the two boys. Lord Lakenham says you are awfully good.
Do play! These boys think they have a chance and I'd love to
beat them. Arnold is rather a dear but he is so conceited. We
will beat them, won't we?"</p>

<p>Jermyn glanced at Sybil.</p>

<p>"Do play," she murmured. "I shall love to look on."</p>

<p>"We will all look on," Lakenham decided. "Perhaps my chance
will come then to talk for a little time with Miss Cluley. I
consider that she has been most shamelessly monopolized ever
since she arrived here."</p>

<p>Sybil sighed.</p>

<p>"You must remember, all of you," she replied, "that Sir
Jermyn is my dramatist. Naturally he has a great deal to say to
me."</p>

<p>Lakenham smiled as he drew out his cigarette case from his
pocket.</p>

<p>"I, too," he declared, looking at her boldly, "can find
something to say to you, Miss Cluley. I am only longing for the
opportunity."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. Jermyn, who had gone away to
fetch his racquet, came towards them, frowning slightly. He had
somehow the feeling that he was deserting Sybil.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that you wouldn't rather come for a walk or do
something?" he asked her, doubtfully.</p>

<p>She smiled back at him reassuringly.</p>

<p>"No, I am going to sit under the trees here and watch," she
insisted. "Besides, Lord Lakenham has something to say to me. He
has made so many charming speeches that I am really curious to
find out how long he will be able to keep it up!"</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="first">Lucille, Sybil and Lakenham sat in deep wicker
chairs in a shady corner of the lawn, watching the tennis.
Before the first game was over, however, Lucille, with a little
sigh of regret, rose gracefully to her feet.</p>

<p>"It does not amuse me to watch those violent pastimes," she
confessed. "Lord Lakenham has been dying to talk to you all day,
Miss Cluley. He shall have his opportunity. I will write some
necessary letters and earn his undying gratitude. Only, accept a
word of advice from me. Believe nothing that he says. I consider
him to be the most shameless person I have met with in the whole
course of my experience."</p>

<p>Sybil's eyes followed her almost despairingly as she moved
slowly towards the house. Lakenham changed at once into her
vacant chair. Jermyn, from his place upon the courts, saw what
had happened and promptly served two faults.</p>

<p>"Lucille will chaff one all the time," Lakenham remarked.
"Bit useful with her tongue, too, isn't she? All the same, I
have been rather anxious to have a little chat with you, Miss
Cluley."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"You know," he went on, "I wish you wouldn't behave as though
I wanted to eat you up, or something of that sort. I am of a
forgiving nature. I harbor no animosity and I bear no
grudges."</p>

<p>She knew then that he remembered. Everything for a moment
seemed to recede from her. The voices of the tennis players
seemed to come from some far-off world. The breeze in the
trees, the perfume of the burnt cedars, the fragrance of the
roses, always insistent, surely belonged to one of those
halcyon, half-forgotten days! This was another world in which
she was living now&mdash;the world of her misery!</p>

<p>"You see, my memory isn't quite so rotten as you must have
thought it was," Lakenham continued. "I haven't forgotten all
about the Gayety Theatre at Blackpool and Miss May Marvis."</p>

<p>She was trembling. Her eyes, which sought his now, were full
of tears.</p>

<p>"The money," she faltered. "I ought to have sent you the
money back. Oh! I have thought of it a hundred times but I was
afraid&mdash;I was afraid that you might trace me through it. It
was wicked of me!"</p>

<p>He laughed loudly, almost boisterously.</p>

<p>"You silly child!" he exclaimed. "What do you suppose that
few pounds meant to me? You can't imagine I ever intended you to
repay it? It was a gift, of course. It was your broken promise
that I minded."</p>

<p>She looked at him like a wounded animal. Nothing that he
could possibly have said could have hurt so much.</p>

<p>"I was mad!" she murmured. "We were both half starved; the
company had come to grief; we hadn't even the money for our
tickets to London, and they told me that Mary wouldn't live
unless I could take her to a nursing home where she was properly
looked after. But I was mad&mdash;I know it! I couldn't&mdash;I
shouldn't really ever have kept my word."</p>

<p>"You took the money," he reminded her, "and you took it upon
that understanding."</p>

<p>A note of passion crept into her tone.</p>

<p>"I had to have it!" she declared. "Call it thieving, if you
like. Charge me with theft&mdash;I'll plead guilty. I did steal
the money. I stole it for her. Look at her now. Do you see how
healthy she is? Wasn't it worth it?"</p>

<p>"I tell you that I do not care," he persisted, "to think of
the money. I think rather of your promise&mdash;the promise
which still remains."</p>

<p>She sat quite still, with closed eyes.</p>

<p>"I wish," he went on, "you wouldn't take it for granted that
I was an enemy."</p>

<p>"If you are not an enemy," she replied swiftly, "why do you
mention it at all? Why could you not have pretended that you did
not recognize me, and have gone away? What does it matter to
you? It is all over and done with."</p>

<p>He laughed in a self-satisfied sort of way.</p>

<p>"Miss Sybil," he said, "I tell you frankly that I'm not
unselfish enough for those things. I warn you that I am going to
give you a bit of a shock. It's a regular queer sort of thing
that's happened to me. Oh, you'll be interested presently, if
you'll listen! Don't understand it myself a bit," he continued,
speaking half to himself now and watching the smoke from the
cigarette which he had just lit curl its way upwards. "Of
course, I've had heaps of affairs, and the marriage traps I've
escaped from&mdash;God bless my soul, I ought to write my
memoirs or whatever you call it, just to show people what a
fellow with a title and a big income has to go through! One gets
as wily towards forty as an old cock pheasant at the end of the
season. That's what makes it so surprising."</p>

<p>"Makes what so surprising?" she asked.</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her. She began to shiver. A
glimmering of the truth forced its way in upon her
consciousness. There were things in his face the ugly things as
they seemed to her.</p>

<p>"You're not going to insult me&mdash;here!"</p>

<p>He smiled confidently.</p>

<p>"If you call it an insult," he replied, "I am going to insult
you in a new and unprecedented fashion. I am going to insult you
in a way that pretty nearly any girl in London would jump at. I
am going to show you that I, too, am capable of big things when
I make up my mind. I am going to ask you to chuck Jermyn and
marry me. Do you hear&mdash;marry me? I'll make you Marchioness
of Lakenham!"</p>

<p>Her fingers were nervously entwined in the basketwork of her
chair. She sat up a little. She even ventured to laugh uneasily
and to look at him once more. The complacency upon his face was
sublime.</p>

<p>"Of course you are joking!" she ventured.</p>

<p>"Joking be&mdash;hanged!" he exclaimed. "No wonder you're
surprised! I don't know what it means myself," he went on, in a
low tone. "I've been gone on women before, and when I've been
gone on 'em I've generally had my own way or got over it pretty
soon. But this time&mdash;well, I don't understand it. I saw you
last night and I haven't rested since. There's something in my
blood&mdash;I don't know what it is but it will never be still
until you belong to me. And I am willing to pay. I'll pay the
price. You've got to throw Jermyn over and marry me."</p>

<p>She began to laugh. To his ears, which were not trained to
niceties, it seemed to be a perfectly natural laugh.</p>

<p>"Throw Jermyn over&mdash;for you!"</p>

<p>She looked at the slim figure upon the lawn, with his clean-cut
face, his deep-set gray eyes. She heard his voice, clear and
pleasant, as he called to his partner. Then she looked back to
the man who lounged by her side.</p>

<p>"Do you think that I am mad," she asked him, "even if you
are? Do you think that I would give up Jermyn for such a
creature as you are?"</p>

<p>His face darkened but he showed no anger.</p>

<p>"I think you'll be mad if you try any games on with me," he
replied. "I can stop your marrying Jermyn and you know it. You
can take my word for it, too, if you don't agree to my terms,
that I shall do it."</p>

<p>"You mean that you will tell him?"</p>

<p>"That or any other dirty trick," Lakenham assured her
promptly. "Mind you, I know I'm a fool. I might have put things
very differently to you. I might have insisted, even now, that
you carried out your bargain."</p>

<p>They were quite silent for some time. Then Sybil rose quietly
to her feet.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" he asked roughly.</p>

<p>"I am going to tell Jermyn," she answered composedly, "when
he has finished this game, that you have insulted me. I am going
to tell him exactly what happened at Blackpool, explain to him
the position I was in, and the despicable means I made use of to
get out of it. I am going to tell him that one of us will have
to leave here at once. He shall choose for himself which it is
to be."</p>

<p>Lakenham, too, rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Now, listen," he said. "That's all right, but what do you
suppose Jermyn will do? He'll send me away right enough, but
what about you? Do you suppose that he'll marry you? You don't
know Jermyn if you believe that! I tell you he's a prig of the
first water. He's the most stuck-up, opinionated, narrow-minded
person that ever breathed. He will do what he thinks right in
spite of anything, but let me tell you this&mdash;he won't marry
you after he's heard about Blackpool. He's never forgiven a
person yet who told him a lie or a half lie. He won't begin by
forgiving you. Do you think he hasn't felt scruples? Do you
think he wanted to bring a mistress here who had adorned the
musical comedy stage a few years ago, even though she is acting
at the theatres now? Not he! He swallowed it because he's in
love with you and because he believes in you. Go and tell him
the truth. I've nothing to lose. You'll probably be glad to
listen to me afterwards."</p>

<p>She sat down again. Her first impulse had passed away. She
was conscious of a fierce desire to temporize with this man, to
do anything in the world sooner than risk for a moment her
new-found and amazing happiness. He saw her hesitation and he
pursued, as he thought, his own advantage.</p>

<p>"Sybil," he continued, "I haven't said much about it
yet&mdash;you haven't given me a chance but I want you to
remember that although Jermyn may be fond of you in his way, I
am just as fond of you in mine. Jermyn will want you to live up
in the clouds with him. You'll find it chilly there sometimes.
I'll keep your feet upon the earth, little woman, and I'll lead
you among the pleasant places. The Lakenham jewels are worth
looking at, and I can make people receive you wherever you
choose to go. I'm fond of you, you witch! What you've done I
don't know but I'm madly fond of you. I'll chuck all those
little affairs you may have heard of. There shall never be
another, I promise it. It's time I settled down, and I will. You
think this over, Sybil. There's no hurry for a few hours. You're
full of the idea of marrying Jermyn, just now, and it's carried
you away a bit. If you want my honest opinion about it, I think
that the woman who marries Jermyn will have a plaguey dull time
of it."</p>

<p>She turned towards him.</p>

<p>"If I told you," she pleaded, "that I love Jermyn, that no
other man in the world could take his place no, not for a single
second!&mdash;wouldn't that make any difference? Wouldn't you
let me off then?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered stolidly, "I wouldn't! You may feel like
that just now. He writes your plays for you and I suppose you
think him a sort of god. That kind of person's all very well
until you try to live with him."</p>

<p>The set was over. Already Jermyn and Mary, flushed with
triumph, were on their way towards them.</p>

<p>"Six-three!" the latter called out, waving her racquet. "They
really hadn't a look in. If only I could have served decently it
would have been a love set."</p>

<p>"Think it over for a few hours," Lakenham muttered in a
hoarse undertone. "I'll say nothing until the evening. Play me a
game of billiards after dinner. You hate bridge, anyway. You can
give me your answer then."</p>

<p>She hesitated. Jermyn was already close to them when he was
intercepted by the butler, who delivered a message. He
hesitated.</p>

<p>"I am wanted on the telephone," he told Sybil. "I'll be out
again in half a moment."</p>

<p>"Don't hurry," Lakenham cried cheerfully. "I don't consider
I've had half an inning with Miss Cluley yet. We've lots more to
say to one another."</p>

<p>"Better get it over quickly, then," Jermyn replied over his
shoulder. "You'll have no more opportunity after I get back. I
see a car-load full from the barracks coming across the park. I
asked some of them over to play tennis. I shan't be a minute,
Sybil."</p>

<p>He turned towards the house. Sybil at first seemed inclined
to follow him but Lakenham blocked the way.</p>

<p>"Be sensible, little woman," he urged. "Don't quarrel with
me. I'm a nasty-tempered fellow to have on the other side.
Remember, after all, that I am doing the square thing: ignoring
the fact that you treated me shamefully, doing all that a fellow
can do who's in love with you. I am asking you to be my wife. I
don't want to boast but it isn't a trifle. It's a new idea to
you and I daresay it hurts just at first to think about chucking
Jermyn, but you know in the long run you've got to do it. Don't
do anything rash. Take an hour or two to think it over. Promise
that you'll play me that game of billiards after dinner? That's
all I ask for now. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"It will be of no use," she answered quietly. "I shall never
change my mind. But I will play billiards with you after dinner.
Only I tell you this now&mdash;I may as well. If you come
between me and Jermyn, if I am never to belong to him, then I
shall never belong to any one."</p>

<p>He smiled a little fatuously, a little confidently. He had at
any rate scored a first success.</p>

<p>"We shall see," he said.</p>

<p>Jermyn reappeared, a few minutes later, with his newly
arrived guests. Lakenham and Sybil strolled up to meet them, and
some sets at tennis were quickly arranged.</p>

<p>"It was really you who were wanted on the telephone,
Lakenham," Jermyn grumbled. "Fellow named Norden Smith&mdash;an
American, I think&mdash;wanted to know whether you were
here."</p>

<p>"The devil he did!" Lakenham remarked. "Sure It wasn't Mrs.
Norden Smith?"</p>

<p>Jermyn shook his head.</p>

<p>"Man's voice, right enough," he replied. "Said he'd known you
in America and found himself in the neighborhood. Would rather
like to say how do you do to you. He's off to Lincoln early
to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>There was a peculiar and unpleasant look for a moment in
Lakenham's face. He was smiling as though at some recollection
that appealed a little grimly to his sense of humor.</p>

<p>"I scarcely remember the fellow," he declared. "He had a
charming wife, though, and they were very civil to me, in their
way, in New York."</p>

<p>"I gathered from what he said that they had entertained you,"
Jermyn said, "so I asked him to dine, of course, but he
preferred to come in afterwards. Said he'd look you up about
half-past nine for a few minutes."</p>

<p>"Hope he won't expect to be asked down to Somerset," Lakenham
remarked. "I want to be in Scotland at least three weeks.
They're so jolly hospitable over there, though, these Americans,
that you don't&mdash;I say, Jermyn, you're not taking Miss
Cluley away?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely," Jermyn replied firmly. "Here's Lucille,
looking, as usual, like a picture. You can either play tennis or
flirt with her to your heart's content. I am terrified to think
that I have left Sybil so long near such a redoubtable
lady-killer."</p>

<p>She turned and laughed daringly into Lakenham's face.</p>

<p>"My dear Jermyn," she said, "you have discretion! Lord
Lakenham has been making flagrant love to me. I very nearly had
to call you."</p>

<p>Lakenham grinned. This was the sort of humor he
appreciated!</p>

<p>"Gad!" he exclaimed, looking at Sybil's slim figure with
something in his eyes which Jermyn hated, "if only I'd had
another half-hour I believe I might have had a chance, after
all."</p>

<p>Jermyn smiled and pointed to the gray stone carving on the
front of the house.</p>

<p>"'What I have, I hold,'" he quoted. "You are just a few days
too late, my gallant cousin."</p>

<p>Lakenham laughed. He stood with his hands in his
pockets&mdash;a typical attitude&mdash;burly, dogged,
confident.</p>

<p>"We'll match mottoes, Jermyn," he said. "You known
mine?&mdash;'I hope, I win!'"</p>

<p>Jermyn drew Sybil's arm through his and turned away.</p>

<p>"I shall at once," he declared, "remove Miss Cluley from the
sphere of your influence!"</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="first">Dinner that night at Annerley was a somewhat
memorable meal for all who took part in it. Besides the
house-party, two men from the neighboring barracks had remained
over, and the doctor who had played bridge the night before had
been sent for. From the first, the atmosphere had been a little
electric. Sybil, from the moment of taking her place at the
table, had seemed animated by the highest spirits. She had
walked into the room as though she were walking on air. The
poise of her neck, the carriage of her lithe body, appeared
alike imbued with some nameless enchantment. She had more color
than usual, her eyes were brilliant, her mouth radiant with
smiles. She was all the time the life of the dinner-party, the
whole centre of attraction. At the head of the table Lucille,
who herself was wonderfully dressed in black and silver, with
strange jewels glistening at her bosom, sat and watched and
listened. The village doctor was on her left, the elder of the
two officers from the barracks on her right. They paid her
polite attentions but their eyes were fixed upon Sybil. She
seemed, indeed, to have found an unaccustomed vein of levity.
She laughed boldly in Lakenham's face; she appeared either to
have conquered or to have completely forgotten her aversion to
him. Jermyn watched her all the time, his eyes shining with
admiration, yet even he, too, now and then wondered. If she were
not actually flirting with Lord Lakenham, she was at any rate
toying with his advances, laughing indulgently at his
compliments, mocking at his rather too obvious earnestness, yet
always with the faint reserve of coquetry which to a man like
Lakenham was so maddening.</p>

<p>Although they had sat down to dinner early, it was half-past
nine before they rose from the table. There was no question of
separation for the cigars and cigarettes had already been
served. Jermyn looked eagerly across at Sybil.</p>

<p>"At last!" he whispered under his breath. "Lakenham, you and
Lucille, Doctor Brownrigg, Captain Mason and Major Lethersett,
must cut out for bridge. Miss Cluley and I are going to have a
talk over the play."</p>

<p>Lakenham laughed heavily. He was very flushed and his eyes
were bright.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, Jermyn, old fellow," he replied. "Miss
Cluley and I have fixed that all up. It's my last night and
she's going to play me a fifty up at billiards."</p>

<p>Jermyn was silent for a moment. His eyes sought Sybil's. She
was suddenly very still and cold.</p>

<p>"Do you really care about billiards, Sybil?" he asked, a
little doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I have promised Lord Lakenham to have one game," she
answered. "After that we can do whatever you like."</p>

<p>Jermyn walked with them into the hall. Notwithstanding
Sybil's altered demeanor, he was conscious of a strange
disinclination to leave her alone with Lakenham. Even when he
had had the lights lit in the billiard-room and had offered to
mark, an offer which Lakenham promptly refused, he lingered on
one pretext or another.</p>

<p>"I think I'll watch the game," he decided. "They don't want
me for bridge."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," Lakenham replied, chalking his cue, "you'll
be shockingly in the way. I can't possibly say nice things to
Miss Cluley while you're around. It isn't giving either of us a
chance. Time enough for you later on."</p>

<p>Jermyn looked across at Sybil but she seemed for some reason
to be avoiding his eyes. He shrugged his shoulders slightly.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I shall be in the library with the other
people when you have finished. Don't tire yourself, Sybil. You
have had plenty of running about to-day."</p>

<p>"I am going to rest after every stroke," she laughed, "and
Lord Lakenham is going to give me twenty in fifty, so I don't
think our game ought to last very long."</p>

<p>"You won't expect me to hurry over it!" Lakenham protested,
ardently.</p>

<p>Sybil was leaning with her back against the billiard table.
She waved her hand to Jermyn.</p>

<p>"If we are not out in half an hour," she begged, "come and
rescue me."</p>

<p>"I shan't allow you a second longer," he replied, smiling at
her. "I'll go and see how the bridge is getting on."</p>

<p>He left the room, closing the door behind him, and made his
way to the library. The remaining four of his guests had just
started a rubber. They had drawn a table up to the open windows
and had turned out all the lights in the room except a couple of
standard lamps, which stood on either side of the table. Jermyn
threw himself into a low chair by Lucille's side. She was dummy
at the moment and she looked down at him with a faint smile. Her
hand rested upon his.</p>

<p>"Miss Cluley seems to be overcoming her aversion to
Aynesworth," she murmured.</p>

<p>He was conscious of the affront of her words; conscious, too,
of a peculiar uneasiness, which was not exactly jealousy and yet
for which he could not wholly account.</p>

<p>"Sybil is never discourteous to any one," he said calmly.
"She may or may not appreciate Aynesworth's attentions. She at
least is considerate enough to remember that he is my kinsman
and her fellow-guest. I think that she is quite right to try and
conquer her antipathy to him."</p>

<p>Lucille smiled once more.</p>

<p>"You will make a model husband, my dear Jermyn!"</p>

<p>"I shall do my best," he answered. "I do not fancy that I
shall find it very troublesome to be what you call a model
husband to Sybil. You see, I happen to be very fond of her."</p>

<p>The play of the hand had only just commenced. Lucille rose
abruptly to her feet.</p>

<p>"Come here," she said, moving towards the open window.</p>

<p>Jermyn obeyed her at once. They stepped out on to the avenue.
The moon had not yet risen, and coming directly from the lighted
room the deep violet twilight seemed full of shadows. She stood
with him behind a little clump of syringa bushes. Jermyn, with
the natural impressionability of an artist always on the lookout
for effects, could scarcely fail to appreciate how striking a
picture she made with her white face, her red lips and blazing
eyes. She swayed a little towards him.</p>

<p>"Jermyn, haven't you any pity at all?" she whispered
passionately. "If you go on parading your affection for that
little chit of an actress before me, I shall say something
foolish. I shall give myself away. You mustn't do it, Jermyn.
Haven't you any heart at all?"</p>

<p>For a moment he made no reply. He was realizing the immense
mistake he had made when he had answered her letter of
self-invitation in the affirmative and begged her to come and play
hostess at Annerley. He was man of the world enough to realize
exactly the position, to realize, too, that short of brutality
he could meet it only by strategy. The pose he decided to assume
sat upon him naturally enough.</p>

<p>"My dear Lucille," he protested, "why try to flirt with me?
The impressionable youth of two great cities are already your
victims. Remember I have seen them fall. I have seen your wiles
from the inside. Perhaps," he added, with a sigh, "even if I am
partially cured, I myself have once felt the spell."</p>

<p>"You!" she muttered bitterly. "You! You feel nothing. You are
only the shadow of a man. You can open your heart to a little
chit of a girl when you keep it closed to me&mdash;Lucille de
Sayers!"</p>

<p>He raised her hand to his lips. Even he could scarcely help
thinking how beautiful her slim, white fingers were. She had all
the grace of long limbs, exceedingly delicate and shapely.
Nevertheless, he moved slightly so that he stood now in the
little ray of light streaming out from the room.</p>

<p>"I suppose it was our old friendship which saved me," he
declared. "Do you hear that? They are dealing."</p>

<p>From where they stood they could hear the soft patter of
cards upon the green baize of the table. Lucille did not move
for a moment. Her bosom was rising and falling quickly, there
was a storm in her eyes.</p>

<p>"You are clever, my dear Jermyn," she murmured. "Some day,
perhaps&mdash;well, we shall see."</p>

<p>She walked away and took her place at the table. Jermyn
strolled off into the shadows of the garden, threaded a laurel
shrubbery and stood by the lake. He was sensitive enough to feel
keenly the little scene which had been precipitated upon him,
but at the back of it all the greater happiness prevailed. Life
had never seemed so splendid to him as in those few minutes when
he walked in the gardens he loved and finally turned his face
towards the house, curiously picturesque in its indistinctness,
with the lights streaming from every window. The half-hour was
up. In a few minutes Sybil would be his once more.</p>

<p>He entered the house through the library window and watched
the game, looking over Lucille's shoulder. She did not once
glance towards him. Then the door was opened and the butler
appeared, ushering in a visitor.</p>

<p>"Mr. Norden Smith, sir," he announced, "to see the Marquis of
Lakenham."</p>

<p>Jermyn turned at once to greet his visitor. He was, as a
matter of fact, rather glad of the distraction. He was glad,
too, of so plausible an excuse for going in and breaking up that
billiard match, which apparently was still continuing. Mr.
Norden Smith was a tall, colorless, thin American, loosely
built, with a long, intelligent face and high forehead. He was
wearing dinner clothes of a somewhat transatlantic cut, and a
small, precisely tied black bow. Jermyn advanced to meet him and
held out his hand.</p>

<p>"You are a friend of Lakenham's, I understand," he remarked.
"I am very glad you came over. I spoke to you on the telephone,
I think. My name is Annerley."</p>

<p>"Glad to meet you, Sir Jermyn Annerley, I am sure," Mr.
Norden Smith replied. "Lord Lakenham stayed with us out in New
York, and he made me promise that I'd look him up if ever I
found myself in this country. I happened to hear by accident
that he was staying here but I've no wish to intrude. I won't
stay longer than just to shake hands with him, if he is anywhere
about."</p>

<p>"You mustn't think of hurrying," Jermyn declared, hospitably.
"Come along and I'll take you to him. He's playing
billiards."</p>

<p>"That's very kind of you," Mr. Norden Smith answered. "I'll
be delighted. Say, this house of yours is marvelously attractive
to an American&mdash;all these old pictures and things! Look as
though they'd sort of been born with the place, you know. Mighty
impressive, I can tell you."</p>

<p>Jermyn smiled as he led his guest across the hall.</p>

<p>"We are rather proud of Annerley," he admitted. "You see my
people have been here uninterruptedly for four hundred and sixty
years, so naturally we managed to collect a good many trifles in
that time."</p>

<p>Mr. Norden Smith looked around him with typical curiosity. He
was expressing his wonder at the size of a suit of armor when
Jermyn threw open the door of the billiard-room. Then he stopped
suddenly in his speech. Jermyn stood upon the threshold, his
right hand gripping the side of the door, absolutely motionless,
bereft for a moment of all power of speech, a numb, nerveless
figure. The American, looking over his shoulder, was the first
to break the silence.</p>

<p>"My God!" he exclaimed. "What's happened here?"</p>

<br>

<br>

<p>Jermyn clutched at his companion and drew him into the room.
His voice, when he spoke, seemed to come from a long way off. He
was scarcely conscious that it belonged to himself.</p>

<p>"Close the door!" he ordered. "We mustn't let any one come
in!"</p>

<p>Lying a yard or two in the room was Lakenham, flat upon his
back, with one arm gripping the leg of the billiard table, as
though he had tried to draw himself up and failed. Far above
him, curling its way to the ceiling, hovered a thin blue cloud
of smoke. There was a faint smell of gunpowder in the air, and
in the centre of his crumpled white shirt front a little hole,
with brown specks around it. Jermyn looked around the room
wildly. There was no sign of any other person there. On the
floor by the side of the prostrate man was Sybil's fan and the
cue she had been playing with, and one or two of the roses,
broken off close to the stalk, which she had been wearing.
Jermyn shivered.</p>

<p>"I was a fool to have left them!" he muttered, with a little
sob in his throat.</p>

<p>"Left whom?" Mr. Norden Smith asked quickly.</p>

<p>Jermyn half closed his eyes. It seemed to him at that moment
that he could see the struggle&mdash;Lakenham, flushed with
wine, taunted, on fire with his admiration; and Sybil,
frightened at last, struggling to escape, his hand probably upon
her mouth. He wiped the beads of perspiration from his
forehead.</p>

<p>"Stay here," he said to his companion. "There's a doctor in
the other room. I'll fetch him."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="first">The room was still swaying before Jermyn's eyes
as he backed towards the door. Mr. Norden Smith, however, had
quietly slipped in front of him.</p>

<p>"One moment, Sir Jermyn," the latter said calmly. "With whom
did you say that Lord Lakenham was playing billiards?"</p>

<p>"With Miss Sybil Cluley," Jermyn replied.</p>

<p>"The young lady whom I heard in the village this afternoon
that you were engaged to marry?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>Mr. Norden Smith listened intently. There seemed to be no one
about. Through the open windows they heard a little peal of
laughter from the bridge-table.</p>

<p>"Collect yourself for a moment, Sir Jermyn. Something
terrible has happened here. If you act too hastily you may make
it more terrible still. Do you see those things upon the
floor?"</p>

<p>Jermyn stared at them without speech.</p>

<p>"Now I am a criminal lawyer," Mr. Norden Smith continued,
"and if I were to speak to you from the point of view of the
law, I should say&mdash;'Touch nothing.' On the other hand,
there is another point of view. I am in a foreign country and my
profession here carries no obligations with it. I am free,
therefore, to offer you the advice of a guest. I know nothing
about the merits of any dispute which Miss Sybil Cluley and Lord
Lakenham may have had, but if I were you I think I should
conceal those very obvious signs of a struggle."</p>

<p>The man's calm tone was having its effect upon Jermyn. He
began to realize the situation more clearly. The sick feeling of
horror which had almost overcome him was still there, but he was
feeling better able to withstand it.</p>

<p>"You are right," he muttered. "I was a fool not to think of
it."</p>

<p>He stooped down and groped about the floor near where Lord
Lakenham was lying. There were half-a-dozen crushed roses from
the bouquet which he had sent to her room before dinner, lying
just underneath the table, a little rosette of ivory satin, a
fragment of lace from her scarf. He picked them up jealously and
stuffed them into his pocket. Mr. Norden Smith looked on
approvingly.</p>

<p>"Little pieces of circumstantial evidence like that," he
remarked, "will sometimes hang an innocent person. If Lord
Lakenham has been shot by anybody, and that certainly seems to
be the case, the young lady must take her chance. There is no
need, however, to prejudice it by handing up testimony like
that."</p>

<p>"She didn't do it!" Jermyn gasped. "Sybil would never have
hurt any one!"</p>

<p>"All the more reason, then," Mr. Norden Smith pointed out,
"for concealing those little scraps of evidence, which certainly
seem to point towards a struggle. And now, if there is really
such a person in the house as a doctor, wouldn't it be best for
you to fetch him?"</p>

<p>Like a man in a dream, Jermyn strode across the hall into the
library. Doctor Brownrigg was just about to play a hand. Jermyn
tapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Brownrigg," he said, "you're wanted. Will you come with me
at once, please?"</p>

<p>The doctor looked around, a little surprised. He was a heavy
man and his instincts were not particularly quick. He was also
enjoying his bridge exceedingly.</p>

<p>"Is it the telephone?" he inquired, irritably. "I will answer
it as soon as I have played this hand. I suppose it's old mother
Gastill again with her rheumatism. These people expect me to go
and give them opium every&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear Jermyn," Lucille exclaimed, "what on earth is the
matter with you? Have you been seeing ghosts?"</p>

<p>The doctor still sat placidly in his place. Jermyn stretched
out his arm, sweeping some of the cards from the table.</p>

<p>"Come with me this moment, Brownrigg," he said, gripping his
shoulder. "Never mind your hand. It is not a telephone message.
Something has happened here&mdash;in the house."</p>

<p>The little party all rose to their feet. Dr. Brownrigg sprang
up quickly enough now and accompanied Jermyn out of the room.
The others followed a few yards behind.</p>

<p>"What is it?" the doctor asked. "What is it, eh? Any one
taken ill suddenly?"</p>

<p>"Lakenham is lying in the billiard-room," Jermyn answered.
"He seems to have shot himself, or&mdash;been shot by accident.
I believe he's dead."</p>

<p>"Good God!" Dr. Brownrigg muttered.</p>

<p>He quickened his pace. They entered the billiard room. Jermyn
closed the door firmly behind them. Mr. Norden Smith was on his
knees, bending over the prostrate body. He looked up as the
doctor entered.</p>

<p>"I don't think he's dead," he remarked. "The wound seems very
near the heart, to me, but he is certainly breathing."</p>

<p>The doctor made a brief examination. When he arose, he was
looking very grave.</p>

<p>"Lord Lakenham is alive," he said. "I cannot say anything
more until I have examined the wound. I should like him carried
up to a bedroom and I must telephone for some instruments and
drugs. It may be necessary to operate. I should like further
advice, too. Send for some of your men-servants, and a low
basket chair or anything that will do for a litter, Sir
Jermyn."</p>

<p>They carried Lakenham upstairs and laid him on the bed in an
unoccupied bedroom. The telephone messages were despatched. The
fastest motor-car in the garage was already on its way to
Norwich to bring out a celebrated surgeon. Meanwhile, the
doctor, at his own request, was left alone with his patient.
Lakenham was unconscious but he still lived. Downstairs, the two
other guests took their leave and departed. Jermyn found Lucille
sitting in the hall.</p>

<p>"He is still alive?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"He is still alive," Jermyn replied.</p>

<p>She came and passed her arm through his.</p>

<p>"Jermyn dear, this is all so horrible," she said softly.
"Come and sit down somewhere quite quietly, somewhere where we
can be alone. There is a question I must ask you."</p>

<p>She led the way into the library. He followed her almost like
a man in a dream. The card-table was still there, the dummy's
hand spread out upon the table, the liqueur glasses, half-empty,
at the side. She poured out some brandy and made him drink
it.</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she asked, "have you seen Miss Cluley?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered; "have you?"</p>

<p>She nodded and glanced anxiously towards the door. After a
moment's hesitation she rose and fastened the French-windows
which led into the garden. Then she came back and stood by his
side.</p>

<p>"Listen," she said. "There will be some one here from the
police station before very long. Dr. Brownrigg told me that he
had been obliged to telephone there. As you can very well
imagine, I do not like Miss Cluley, but I don't want to see her
give herself away completely."</p>

<p>Jermyn caught hold of the edge of the mantelpiece by which he
was standing.</p>

<p>"You don't believe," he gasped,&mdash;"you don't believe that
Sybil shot him?"</p>

<p>"I know that she did," Lucille replied calmly.</p>

<p>There was a moment's awful silence. Jermyn's face was like
marble. Everything in the room was indistinct to him. He saw
only Lucille's eyes shining with sympathy, heard only her
regretful, convincing words.</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she pleaded, "you must face this matter like a man.
For these few moments, at any rate, you must look the facts in
the face and put sentiment on one side. I would not for the
world say a thing against Sybil Cluley, but it is quite certain
that Aynesworth knew something about her past which she herself
was exceedingly anxious that he should not reveal to you. That
much I think you must half know yourself. No, don't trouble to
interrupt me. It is the truth. You remember that she fainted
last night at something which she saw in the <i>Tatler</i>. She
fainted, horror-stricken at the idea that as soon as Aynesworth
saw that little notice of her career he would be supplied with
the missing link in the chain of his memory. Jermyn, an hour
afterwards that interview was cut out of every illustrated paper
in the house. Aynesworth sent to Norwich to-day&mdash;you saw
his man returning on his motor-bicycle&mdash;and got copies.
Directly he saw them, he remembered. You saw how she changed
towards him. She flirted with him flagrantly at dinner-time. She
did her best to bribe him to silence. He probably wanted more
than she was willing to give. That isn't my affair. At this
moment it isn't yours. Anyway, there is no doubt that they
quarreled in the billiard-room this evening. Look at it any way
you like, Jermyn. Even the angels are foolish sometimes, you
know, and this is the one moment in your life when, for your own
sake, you must face the truth. There isn't the faintest doubt in
the world that Sybil Cluley shot Aynesworth sooner than have him
tell you of a little episode which I fancy might have disturbed
even your perfect faith in her."</p>

<p>"I can't believe it!" Jermyn exclaimed. "Sybil was afraid of
Aynesworth, I know. There was something which she was going to
tell me, something which she will tell me."</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" Lucille replied. "She never meant to tell you, or
if she did, it wasn't the whole truth that you were to hear.
Those two quarreled in the billiard-room and Aynesworth was
found shot. Who else in the whole world, do you suppose, could
have done it? Is there a single person you can think of?"</p>

<p>"It may have been an accident!" Jermyn muttered.</p>

<p>"An accident! Well, let me go on," Lucille continued. "A
quarter of an hour ago, Miss Sybil Cluley, in a blue serge
traveling suit and carrying a dressing-case, stole out of her
room. I found her on her way to the back stairs. If she does
escape the fate she deserves," Lucille went on, "she has me to
thank for it. I sent her back to her room pretty quickly. I
never in my life knew anything so idiotic as an attempt to
escape like that!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean that she was leaving the house?" Jermyn
demanded.</p>

<p>"Absolutely!" Lucille replied. "She made no bones about it.
She was terrified, she said, about being asked questions. I
talked common sense with her and she was quick enough to realize
what a fool she had been. She has changed back again into her
dinner clothes. She is quite composed now and prepared to face
the thing."</p>

<p>"I must go to her," Jermyn declared.</p>

<p>"Go, by all means, if you will," Lucille replied. "I am not
trying to keep you apart. If you take my advice, though, you
will say very little. I have talked to her for some time. She
hasn't the least idea now of giving herself away. She will deny
that there was the slightest disagreement between them. She does
not know who shot him. She came away leaving him practicing
cannons. I have impressed that upon her. That is the story she
will tell."</p>

<p>"And how do you know that it is not the true one?" Jermyn
asked.</p>

<p>Once more Lucille looked around the room. Then she thrust her
hand into the bosom of her gown and produced a small pistol.</p>

<p>"You had better take charge of this," she said. "I have been
concealing it myself for the last half-hour but it is more your
affair than mine. This was lying on the carpet in Sybil Cluley's
room."</p>

<p>Jermyn took it from her almost mechanically.</p>

<p>"You found it where?"</p>

<p>"I found it exactly where I say&mdash;in Sybil Cluley's
room," Lucille repeated. "Jermyn, try and be a man. Don't look
so dumbfounded. Sybil Cluley may be everything you think she is
but it is just as certain as that you and I are talking here
that she shot Aynesworth. We both know what he was. He was a cad
about women. He had been puzzling ever since she arrived about
some memory. Well, it came to him, and whatever that memory was,
it was the memory of something in her past life which affected
her reputation. She knew all about it. Aynesworth wouldn't
forget to rub it in. She was above making terms with him,
without a doubt, but she saw the chance of losing you. Probably
she lost her head. Why not? Frankly, I am sorry for her, Jermyn.
I am sorry for her because I think that Aynesworth was probably
brutally provoking. I want to save her. You must take my
advice."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"She will be asked questions. She will probably have to
attend the inquest. She will come under a certain amount of
suspicion, without a doubt. So long as that pistol is never
produced and the stories of any disagreement between her and
Aynesworth are kept quiet, she is in no more danger than any one
of us. Don't agitate her. Don't put fresh ideas into her
head&mdash;she knows just what she has to say. And if you do see
her, for Heaven's sake don't let her try to run away again!"</p>

<p>Jermyn walked to the window and stood there for several
moments. Somewhere in the far distance he could hear a motor-car
approaching. It was probably the police! He turned back to
Lucille.</p>

<p>"If she did this," he cried hoarsely, "it must have been in a
wild moment! She wasn't accountable&mdash;they can't make her
accountable! She was terrified of Aynesworth all the
time&mdash;no one could help seeing it."</p>

<p>"I agree with you absolutely," Lucille replied, "but we must
remember that the law judges differently. It takes no account of
provocation. We must. Don't disturb her now. If they ask her
questions to-night, she knows exactly what she has to say. I'll
do the best I can for her, Jermyn, for your sake, but let me
tell you this you&mdash;are the only person whom I ever shall
tell&mdash;I am going to put the fact absolutely out of my mind.
Listen."</p>

<p>She paused for a moment. The motor-car was drawing nearer and
there were footsteps in the hall, but the room in which they
were was still empty.</p>

<p>"I saw Sybil Cluley with the pistol in her hand. I went along
the lawn just as far as the billiard-room window just before Mr.
Norden Smith came. I thought it was only a joke. Mind, no one
else shall ever know that from me. After all, she is a woman and
she must have been taunted almost to madness. Listen! Who's
that? There's some one coming down the stairs."</p>

<p>They both listened intently. From where they stood they could
just distinguish the sound of light, stealthy footsteps upon the
smooth oak of the staircase, the swish of a dress, footsteps
that hesitated a little and yet came steadily on. Jermyn moved
to the door and threw it wide open. They both stood upon the
threshold, looking out. With her hand upon the banisters,
peering half fearfully forward, only a few steps above them,
stood Sybil.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="first">Sybil descended the last few stairs with her
head turned sideways, her eyes distended, unnaturally large,
fixed upon Jermyn. When she reached the hall she seemed to
steady herself. Then she came slowly towards the threshold of
the library. For the moment Jermyn could do no more than look at
her. She was wearing now the dress she had worn at dinner-time.
He could see the place from which the rosette was missing. One
or two of the roses were hanging limply from her brooch. She had
the look of one who walks in her sleep.</p>

<p>"Sybil!" he cried softly.</p>

<p>She looked into his eyes and he shivered. There was some new
thing there, something which seemed to raise a wall between
them. She came slowly on, but the hands which he had held out
fell to his side.</p>

<p>"Sybil!" he cried once more.</p>

<p>"This is horrible!" she whispered. "Let me come in. I am
afraid to stay upstairs any longer."</p>

<p>She came slowly into the room. Jermyn closed the door after
her.</p>

<p>"Sybil," he insisted hoarsely, "tell me the whole truth, the
whole story&mdash;everything you know? I must understand exactly
what you are going to say, before these men come to ask you
questions."</p>

<p>She began to tremble. She opened her lips to speak but closed
them again.</p>

<p>"Listen," Lucille said, "listen, both of you. This is a
critical moment. In a very short time there may be people here
before whom a single slip might mean irretrievable disaster.
Sybil Cluley, remember that no one save I myself saw you trying
to leave the house. I have forgotten it. You have put those
clothes back in your trunk?"</p>

<p>"I have put them back," Sybil agreed, in a dull tone.</p>

<p>"Very good. Now listen to me intently. Remember you played
that fifty up with Lord Lakenham. You finished the game. Your
head ached. You made an excuse and left him. You went straight
to your room. You meant to take some phenacetin and come down
again. He was practicing cannons, which he had been trying to
teach you, when you left. He was alone. You neither saw nor
heard any one approaching the room."</p>

<p>Sybil began to tremble. She looked away from Jermyn.</p>

<p>"I neither saw nor heard any one approach," she repeated.
"Lord Lakenham was alone when I left."</p>

<p>Lucille inclined her head.</p>

<p>"That is simple," she said. "There was no quarrel between you
and Lord Lakenham, no disagreement of any sort."</p>

<p>"There was no quarrel," Sybil repeated.</p>

<p>"What we three know," Lucille went on, "about that little
paragraph in the paper which recalled a certain incident to Lord
Lakenham's mind, no one outside this room knows. We must all
bear that in mind. There was no secret understanding between you
and Lord Lakenham. He was a stranger to you. You met him here
for the first time."</p>

<p>"I met him here for the first time," Sybil repeated.</p>

<p>"You parted on good terms, you left him in good
spirits...Now, Jermyn, listen to me. You were with me out in the
garden most of the time when Sybil was playing billiards with
Lord Lakenham. You came straight from the garden into the
bridge-room. Mr. Norden Smith found you there. You and he
together went to the billiard-room. You had not previously
entered it since dinner."</p>

<p>"I had not been near it since dinner," Jermyn repeated.</p>

<p>Sybil was standing with her eyes tightly closed. She was
swaying a little on her feet. Jermyn almost pushed her into a
chair and her head fell forward into her hands.</p>

<p>"You had not entered the billiard-room since dinnertime,"
Lucille said calmly. "You entered it for the first time with Mr.
Norden Smith. You found Lord Lakenham lying there in his present
condition. There were no signs of a struggle there; you saw no
weapon&mdash;nothing. The affair is a complete mystery to you.
That is all quite simple, is it not?"</p>

<p>"It is quite simple."</p>

<p>Lucille held her head for a moment.</p>

<p>"I do not think that there is anything which I have
forgotten," she said. "You heard the front door bell? Those are
the men from Norwich, I suppose. You had better let them ask
anybody any questions they wish to. The great thing for us three
to remember is this. We are in a state of mystification. We have
no idea as to who shot Lord Lakenham. If he recovers and makes a
statement, that is a matter against which, of course, we cannot
guard. Except for that we should be safe."</p>

<p>Sybil raised her head slowly and looked at Jermyn. She met
the fiercely questioning look in his eyes without flinching.</p>

<p>"What, in God's name&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>Lucille's arm shot out.</p>

<p>"Hush!" she whispered hoarsely. "Those men are in the hall.
They will be shown in here. Hush!"</p>

<p>There was a tap at the door even as she spoke. The butler
entered. He made his way to Jermyn.</p>

<p>"There is a police inspector here, sir," he announced in an
undertone. "He wishes to have a few words with you, if it is
quite convenient."</p>

<p>Jermyn nodded.</p>

<p>"I will come out," he said.</p>

<p>The two women were left alone. Lucille came over and stood by
the side of Sybil.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Cluley," she remarked dryly, "surely the
training of your profession should stand you in better stead
than this! Be agitated, if you like, but don't be tragical.
Remember, if a suspicion is once planted, it quickly grows. It
rests with you to see that it is not planted."</p>

<p>The police inspector was very civil and not in the least
officious. Jermyn took him at once into the billiard-room and
showed him as nearly as he could how Lakenham had been
found.</p>

<p>"Nothing in the room," the inspector asked, "has been
disturbed?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," Jermyn assured him.</p>

<p>"Nothing removed from the floor, for instance?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," Jermyn repeated.</p>

<p>The man went on his hands and knees and made a searching
examination of the whole place.</p>

<p>"No weapon?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"I have not seen one," Jermyn replied.</p>

<p>The inspector locked up the apartment and put the key in his
pocket.</p>

<p>"If quite convenient, Sir Jermyn," he said, "I should be glad
to be taken upstairs to Lord Lakenham's bedroom. The doctor can
then tell me if there is any chance of his lordship's being able
to make a statement."</p>

<p>Jermyn accompanied the man upstairs. Lakenham had been taken
into one of the large bedrooms in the east wing, which was
approached through a spacious sitting-room. The doctor answered
their soft tap at the door and stepped outside at once.</p>

<p>"This is Inspector Holmes from Norwich," Jermyn explained.
"He is anxious just to have a word with you."</p>

<p>"I am bound to ask you at once," the inspector put it, "if
there is any chance of Lord Lakenham being able to make a
statement shortly?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say," the doctor answered. "He is alive but
unconscious. The wound is an exceedingly dangerous one and his
situation is critical. I am afraid an operation will be
necessary within the next few hours, but from what I can gather
of the patient's condition, I must confess that it is very
doubtful whether he will survive it. I am expecting Dr. Fielden
from Norwich in a very few minutes, but I am sure he will only
confirm what I am telling you."</p>

<p>"Has his lordship spoken at all?" the inspector inquired.</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>"Have any of his clothes been removed&mdash;his shirt, for
instance?"</p>

<p>"I have put the shirt on one side for you," the doctor
replied. "It is locked up in a chest of drawers here. You must
excuse me now. I dare not leave my patient any longer."</p>

<p>He hurried back to the bedside. The inspector and Jermyn
turned away.</p>

<p>"Lord Lakenham, I presume, had nothing on his mind?" the
former asked. "He was not in the least likely to have committed
suicide?"</p>

<p>Jermyn shook his head.</p>

<p>"The idea seems preposterous," he declared. "Lakenham was in
excellent spirits all day. He was a man who thoroughly enjoyed
life, he was wealthy, and, so far as I know, he had no troubles
of any sort. His was not at all the sort of morbid disposition
one associates with the victims of suicide."</p>

<p>"Who was the last person who saw him before he was shot?"</p>

<p>"Miss Cluley&mdash;Miss Sybil Cluley&mdash;the young lady who
is engaged to be my wife," Jermyn answered slowly. "She was
playing billiards with him, but she complained of a headache and
left him as soon as the game was over."</p>

<p>"Could I have a few words with her?" the inspector
suggested.</p>

<p>"Certainly," Jermyn assured him. "She is in the library now.
Mr. Norden Smith, too, the gentleman who was with me when we
discovered Lord Lakenham, is still here in case he is required.
We shall find him, I think, in the smoking-room."</p>

<p>"He will do presently. I should like to speak to Miss Cluley
first."</p>

<p>Jermyn led the way into the library. Sybil was sitting in the
same easy-chair, in very much the same attitude. Lucille had
apparently been standing with her elbow upon the mantelpiece,
talking to her. Both women turned their heads as the two men
entered.</p>

<p>"Sybil," Jermyn said, closing the door behind him, "I am
sorry but the inspector wants to ask just one or two questions.
I hope you won't mind?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not mind at all," she replied.</p>

<p>"It is my duty to make a report of this affair," the
inspector explained, with a slight salute, "and any information
you can give me I should be glad to have. At the same time, this
is not a formal inquiry, and it is not in the least necessary
that you answer any questions unless you care to."</p>

<p>Sybil's eyebrows were slowly raised. She seemed somehow to
have completely recovered her self-possession.</p>

<p>"If I can be of any assistance, I am sure you are welcome to
all the knowledge I possess of the affair."</p>

<p>The inspector bowed.</p>

<p>"As the last person who saw Lord Lakenham before he was shot,
madame," he said, "your evidence will, of course, be of
importance."</p>

<p>"All that I can tell you," Sybil continued, "seems very
unimportant and I am afraid it will not help much. You can hear
it now, or any one can hear it at any time they choose. I played
billiards with Lord Lakenham after dinner, as I do not care for
bridge. We had quite a cheerful game and Lord Lakenham was all
the time in the highest spirits. We talked and laughed so much,
indeed, that when the game was over I had quite a bad headache,
so I went up to my room, meaning to take some phenacetin and
come down again. I left Lord Lakenham practicing cannons. That
is all that I know about the matter."</p>

<p>"There was, then, no quarrel between you?"</p>

<p>"Quarrel?" Sybil repeated. "Lord Lakenham was much too
gallant a man, I can assure you, to quarrel with a lady."</p>

<p>"There was no misunderstanding, or anything of that
sort?"</p>

<p>"Miss Cluley is engaged to marry me," Jermyn intervened. "Her
acquaintance with Lord Lakenham is of the slightest. She has
known him, in fact, for barely twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>The inspector made a note or two in his book.</p>

<p>"For the sake of formality," he persisted, "I should like you
to answer my question. I am taking it that there was nothing in
the nature of a quarrel or disagreement between you and Lord
Lakenham?"</p>

<p>"I have already assured you," Sybil repeated calmly, "that
there was nothing of the sort."</p>

<p>"You played one game of billiards and after its completion
went upstairs. A game of fifty or a hundred up?"</p>

<p>"A game of fifty up."</p>

<p>The inspector closed his book.</p>

<p>"If you would excuse me for one moment," he said, "I will
return."</p>

<p>Jermyn moved forward.</p>

<p>"Shall I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you will allow me, sir, I will go alone," the inspector
interrupted.</p>

<p>He crossed the hall and they heard him enter the billiard-room.
In a moment or two he was back, having carefully locked
the door behind him.</p>

<p>"You say, Miss Cluley, that you played Lord Lakenham a game
of billiards, fifty up, and that you finished the game amicably
and went upstairs. The score on the marking board at present is
twenty-eight and thirty. How do you account for that if the game
was finished and if it was a fifty up?"</p>

<p>Sybil looked straight into the man's eyes. There was a
perceptible pause before she spoke. Jermyn felt his heart
beating fast. Was she really thinking&mdash;thinking out her
answer?</p>

<p>"Lord Lakenham agreed to give me twenty points," she said
slowly. "We omitted to put them on at the commencement of the
game. Therefore, when I had reached thirty I had won."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence in the room. Somehow, the cold
preciseness of Sybil's answers was terrifying Jermyn. Perhaps,
notwithstanding all that he felt for her, some such thought was
in his mind as the inspector presently expressed.</p>

<p>"You are, I believe, an actress, madame?" the latter
asked.</p>

<p>"That is my profession," she admitted.</p>

<p>"And I think I understood from Sir Jermyn Annerley that Lord
Lakenham was a stranger to you when you met him here?"</p>

<p>"Entirely."</p>

<p>"He had said nothing during the evening which had led you to
believe that he was in any sort of trouble or distress?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary," Sybil declared, "he seemed in the highest
of spirits. He grumbled because I would not play again, but
directly he understood that my headache was really painful, he
made no further attempt to keep me."</p>

<p>"Do you, Sir Jermyn, or you, Miss Cluley, or you, madame,"
the inspector continued, turning to Lucille, "know of any other
person who did enter or could have entered the billiard-room
between the time of Miss Cluley's leaving it and your discovery
of this accident?"</p>

<p>They all replied in the negative. The inspector closed his
book finally.</p>

<p>"I trust that my questions have not been offensive," he said,
a little apologetically. "It is not my duty to enter upon a
complete cross-examination. I have only to ask the obvious
questions which might lead to the truth being discovered before
any time has been allowed to intervene. Perhaps it would be as
well now, Sir Jermyn, if I had a word with the gentleman who was
with you when you entered the billiard-room."</p>

<p>"Shall you require to speak to these ladies again?" Jermyn
inquired. "If not, I daresay they would be glad to retire."</p>

<p>"Certainly not, sir," the inspector replied. "I shall leave
my two men here, if you will permit me, until I have reported
this matter at headquarters, and it would perhaps be as well if
no one left the house for more than a slight expedition, at the
immediate present."</p>

<p>"There is no one, I am sure," Jermyn declared, "who proposes
leaving it. If you will come this way, then."</p>

<p>The inspector turned towards Lucille and Sybil. He glanced at
Lucille but it was Sybil upon whom his eyes rested.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to have had to trouble you, madame," he said. "I
wish you good night."</p>

<p>Sybil looked at him unfalteringly. There was no smile upon
her lips, but she inclined her head slightly.</p>

<p>"Good night!" she answered.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="first">Once more the inspector and Jermyn crossed the
hall and this time entered the smoking-room. Mr. Norden Smith,
with a very large cigar in his mouth and a whisky-and-soda by
his side, was lying stretched out upon one easy-chair with his
legs in another. He rose with a little apology as the door
opened.</p>

<p>"Say, I hope you'll forgive my making myself comfortable," he
said to his host. "You told me to ring for anything I wanted.
That affair gave me quite a nasty shock. Is there any change in
his lordship's condition?"</p>

<p>"None at present," Jermyn answered. "I am very glad indeed
that you have been looking after yourself. This," he added,
turning to the inspector, "is Mr. Norden Smith. He had called to
see Lord Lakenham and was shown into the library, where we were
all playing bridge, by my butler. I took him to the billiard-room,
with the result you know of."</p>

<p>"Did you notice any signs of a struggle, or any traces in the
room of the recent presence of any other person, excepting, of
course, Miss Cluley, sir?" the inspector asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Norden Smith shook his head negatively.</p>

<p>"There was nothing unusual whatever to be observed," he
replied, "with the exception, of course, of Lord Lakenham's
position and condition. I may add." he went on, "that I am a
criminal lawyer myself and have a quick eye for details.
Directly I saw the brown rim round the bullet mark on the shirt,
I decided that it was a case of suicide."</p>

<p>"May I inquire," the inspector proceeded, "the nature of your
business with Lord Lakenham?"</p>

<p>"I hadn't any business with him at all," Mr. Nor den Smith
confessed. "He stayed with us in New York only a month or so
ago. We entertained him once or twice, and when he heard that I
was coming to England this summer he made me promise I'd look
him up. Quite a good fellow, Lord Lakenham, and we enjoyed
taking him round very much indeed. I happened to be spending the
night at the inn here, and heard that he was staying with Sir
Jermyn, so I telephoned over. Sir Jermyn was kind enough to ask
me to dinner but I had some mail to look after, so I told him
I'd come round afterwards."</p>

<p>"You say that you are staying at the inn," the inspector
asked. "Isn't this rather an out-of-the-way place for a casual
visitor?"</p>

<p>"I am on a motoring tour, doing all the cathedral cities of
England," Mr. Norden Smith explained. "Ecclesiastical
architecture is a bit of a hobby with me. I've done the west
coast. I was at Norwich this morning and I meant to get as far
as Lynn to-night. I had bad tire trouble all the way from
Norwich here and finally I got sick of it. The Annerley Arms
looked very comfortable, so I put up there and set my man to
work to put on new covers. I am on my way to Lincoln and
Durham."</p>

<p>"Did I understand, Sir Jermyn," the inspector inquired, "that
Mr. Norden Smith was shown into the library by your butler?"</p>

<p>"That is so," Jermyn assented.</p>

<p>"The same servant who admitted Mr. Norden Smith at the front
door?"</p>

<p>"I believe so," Jermyn replied. "Such would naturally be the
case. It is quite easy to find out."</p>

<p>"The matter would be finished up," the inspector said
apologetically, "if I might just ask the question."</p>

<p>Jermyn rang the bell. The butler himself answered the
summons.</p>

<p>"Roberts&mdash;" Jermyn began.</p>

<p>The inspector intervened.</p>

<p>"Will you allow me, sir? It is quite an unimportant question
but it is more in order for me to ask it myself. Your name is
Roberts?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"You showed this gentleman into the bridge-room this evening.
Did you also admit him at the front door?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"He asked for Lord Lakenham?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"Did you know that Lord Lakenham was in the billiard-room?"</p>

<p>"I believed that he was, sir," the butler replied, "because I
had served coffee there. In any case, though, it seemed more in
order to show the gentleman first into the room where Sir Jermyn
was."</p>

<p>"And so you took him there direct from the front door?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

<p>The inspector nodded.</p>

<p>"That is all that I wish to know from you. By the way,
though, you say that you served coffee in the billiard-room?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"To Lord Lakenham and Miss Cluley?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir! His lordship also took a liqueur brandy."</p>

<p>"They were alone at the time?</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"Playing billiards?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"Did they seem interested in the game?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir. His lordship was showing Miss Cluley how to
hold the rest when I entered. I had to wait with the coffee tray
until she had finished her stroke."</p>

<p>Once more the inspector closed his book, and obeying a
gesture from his master Roberts disappeared.</p>

<p>"It will not be necessary for you to interrupt your journey,
sir," the inspector remarked, turning to Mr. Norden Smith. "If
you will permit me, though," he added, turning to Jermyn, "in
case the ladies should not have retired I should rather like to
ask Miss Cluley one more question."</p>

<p>Jermyn frowned a little impatiently.</p>

<p>"If you are quite sure that it is essential," he said. "You
can understand, I am sure, how terribly upset Miss Cluley
naturally is."</p>

<p>"It is simply," the inspector explained, "with a view to
making things easier later on. It is a subject I should have
alluded to before but I must confess that it slipped my
memory."</p>

<p>Jermyn led him back once more into the library. Lucille and
Sybil were still there. At the opening of the door they both
started. Jermyn hurried over to Sybil's side and drew her hand
through his arm.</p>

<p>"It is too bad to worry you, I know, dear," he said, "but the
inspector wishes to ask one more question. Perhaps it is just as
well for him to get them over. It is something which he had
forgotten."</p>

<p>"I wish to ask," the inspector interposed, "whether you, Miss
Cluley, had seen Lord Lakenham in possession of any sort of a
pistol during the evening?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Most certainly not."</p>

<p>"Do you possess a pistol yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>The inspector looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"May I ask where it is?"</p>

<p>She smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"It is among my properties at the Imperial Theatre," she
replied, distinctly. "It has never had any cartridges, nor am I
sure that I know how to use it."</p>

<p>"You haven't it with you here, then?" the inspector
persisted.</p>

<p>"Didn't I make that clear?" she asked. "So far as I know, it
has never been out of my dressing-room in the Imperial Theatre.
It was most certainly there when I left London. It is certainly
there now."</p>

<p>The inspector saluted the two ladies.</p>

<p>"Then it is very certain, madam," he declared, "that it is of
no interest to us in our present investigation. I am sorry to
have had to trouble you again. I wish you both good night."</p>

<p>Jermyn led him out into the hall.</p>

<p>"This is a very extraordinary affair, sir," the man remarked.
"May I ask a question which you may perhaps think a little
unwarranted at the present juncture?"</p>

<p>"You may ask anything you like," Jermyn answered.</p>

<p>"Do you know any one in this house, sir, who has any cause
for enmity against his lordship?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely no one," Jermyn replied. "Lakenham was an
easy-going, good-natured sort of fellow, without violent likes or
dislikes, a man who was quite content, too, to lead the ordinary
life of pleasure. I can't conceive why he should have had an
enemy, and I can't think it possible that he could have had one
under this roof."</p>

<p>"I trust that you will not take exception to any arrangements
which I feel it to be my duty to make," the inspector continued.
"You see, the circumstances of this case are very peculiar.
Suicide seems a strange theory in any case, and the fact that no
weapon was discovered by the side of the body seems to dispose
of that theory altogether. I am compelled, therefore, to regard
it as a case of murder."</p>

<p>Jermyn shivered a little. It was a hackneyed word enough, but
in his own house, concerning his own kinsman, with those whom he
loved so closely involved, it seemed to possess a new and more
hideous significance.</p>

<p>"I am now," the inspector went on, "going to make a thorough
search of the apartment and of the gardens outside. I prefer to
do this by myself. I shall then return to Norwich and make my
report. I am compelled to leave one of my men upstairs, in or
near the apartment where Lord Lakenham is lying. The other one I
must leave in the billiard-room. You will understand, I am sure,
the necessity for such steps."</p>

<p>"I am quite convinced, Mr. Inspector," Jermyn replied, "that
you will do what you conceive to be your duty. Our only concern
must be to help you in every possible way. If you will ring the
bell as soon as you have finished your examination of the
billiard-room, Roberts will be glad to bring you any
refreshments you may care for."</p>

<p>"I am much obliged, sir."</p>

<p>"And if you do discover anything," Jermyn continued,
suggestively,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If I should make any discoveries, or come upon anything
likely to indicate a clew," the inspector intervened, "I am
afraid that at this stage of the proceedings I must keep it
entirely to myself. The chief constable will probably be over
to-morrow morning early, sir, and I am sure he will be glad to
discuss the matter with you. Good night, sir!"</p>

<p>Jermyn hurried back to the library. Lucille was there
alone.</p>

<p>"Where is Sybil?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>"She has gone to her room," Lucille replied, coming to his
side and drawing her arm through his. "Jermyn dear, you must sit
down and rest for a little time. I have told Roberts to put the
decanters on the sideboard. Please give me something to drink
and help yourself."</p>

<p>Jermyn seemed scarcely to hear her.</p>

<p>"Gone to her room!" he repeated. "I want to speak to her. I
must speak to her. I can't bear this any longer. I am going to
hold her hands and pull that wall down. She is going to tell me
everything and I am going to tell her that whatever she did was
right."</p>

<p>She forced him into a chair and sat at his feet.</p>

<p>"Jermyn dear," she insisted, "you must please be guided by me
for a very short time. You are not yourself when you talk like
that. Sybil went through her examination beautifully. You and I
between us will keep any harm away from her, but we can only
succeed if you keep down those wild impulses of yours and act
like a rational human being. There is plenty of time in the
future for understandings. For the next few days, what we have
to do is to keep her safe."</p>

<p>Jermyn sprang suddenly to his feet.</p>

<p>"This is all sophistry!" he cried. "The truth is always best.
I shall go to her now. I don't care what the result may be. If
she killed Aynesworth, she did it in self-defense. The fellow
had drunk too much wine. He had probably insulted her. It served
him right. It would be better for her, even now, to tell the
truth and have done with it, better to face her trial and what
may happen to her, than that she should carry this load about
with her all her life. I will go to her room. I will make her
talk with me at once."</p>

<p>Already he was on his way towards the door.</p>

<p>"Stop!" Lucille called out.</p>

<p>There was a quality in her voice which commanded his
attention. He turned unwillingly around.</p>

<br>

<br>

<p>"A single word of what you have said overheard by that man in
the billiard-room," Lucille said softly, "would mean, what do
you think&mdash;for Sybil? It would mean an ignominious and
awful death. Don't look at me as though I were mad. Be a man,
Jermyn, and face facts. Sybil killed Aynesworth not in
self-defense but because he threatened to disclose a little chapter
of her past which she feared would have ended her relations with
you. That is the honest, the absolute truth. Very likely she
only meant to frighten him. Certainly it was only an impulse.
But she killed him. It is hard for you to realize it to-night,
but as the days go on you will know it and understand. If you go
to her now, she is half distraught, she will listen to what you
have to say; she is ready to take any advice. She will go
downstairs to that man. She will say&mdash;'It is true. I killed
Lord Lakenham. He threatened to take a mean advantage of certain
knowledge which he possessed. I meant to frighten him into
silence. I lost my temper. I pulled the trigger of that pistol.
It was such a little thing. I never dreamed that it would kill
him!' To her she may seem to be justifying herself. Before her
own conscience she may seem justified. To you and to me, even,
she may seem justified. But the law will not think so. The law
will hang her!...Be careful, Jermyn. If you do a rash thing
to-night, you may spend the rest of your life regretting it."</p>

<p>The impulse died away. Lucille's words seemed to burn
themselves into his brain. He came back into the room. She stole
softly to his side.</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she whispered, "be brave, dear. She shall be saved.
For your sake, I will save her."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="first">Up in the skies, the stars which had made the
summer night so brilliant were beginning to pale, to fade away
in a nebulous and airy waste. The deep yellow glow was passing
from the face of the moon. Jermyn, who was standing motionless
behind a thick clump of laurel bushes, turned his head and gazed
eastwards. Surely those terrible hours must soon pass! As yet,
however, there was no break in the clouds. The great white house
with its rows of dead windows seemed itself to have borrowed
from the solemnity and mystery of the passing moments. Forty
silent, unblinking eyes gazed out upon a world of opalescent
hues and shadows.</p>

<p>One, two, three, four! The brazen notes of the stable clock
seemed like an incongruous note from some alien world. Jermyn,
from behind his ambush of laurel bushes, stiffened suddenly and
leaned forward. His eyes were fixed upon a certain window,
Sybil's window, the fourth from the left on the second story of
the house. He was all the time expecting something, yet
expecting it with a sense of excitement which in that strange
solitude he took no pains to conceal. A thrush hopped out on to
the dew-soaked lawn, a faint breeze rustled among the leaves of
the trees; the deathly silence was broken. And almost
simultaneously the still monotony of those rows of windows was
changed. A faint light glimmered in the one which he was
watching. It was moving about in the room. It proceeded
obviously from some one carrying a candle. Jermyn waited only
for a few seconds and then deserted his post with swift and
silent footsteps. He threaded the narrow path which ran through
the back of the shrubberies and pursued it until he reached the
side of the house. There he came once more to a standstill. As
before, it was one window only which he watched&mdash;the third
from the left, the window of the anteroom adjoining Lord
Lakenham's bedchamber. When he arrived there, it was as all the
others in the front, blank and lifeless, in almost startling
contrast to the steady glow from the windows of the bedchamber
itself. Jermyn stood there waiting and almost holding his
breath. The seconds dragged by, tearing at his nerves with an
actual and physical pain. Then he saw the thing for which he had
been waiting. The light from Sybil's room was repeated in the
window which he was watching. It gleamed there only for a
moment. Some one had passed by the window, holding a candle.</p>

<p>His vigil was over. Keeping still in the shadow of the house,
Jermyn walked along a narrow margin of turf for some dozen yards
or so. Then he stopped short, pushed back the windows of his
library and stepped in. He turned up with steady fingers the
lamp, which had been burning low. It seemed to him that his last
faint hope had passed. Sybil had gone to the rooms of the dying
man to plead for her life! Even in the face of the tragedy which
was beating itself out through the slow seconds of the night, he
found himself tortured with maddening thoughts of the secret
which the dying man was to carry with him to the grave.</p>

<p>The seconds ticked on into minutes. After the tenseness of
the last few hours, a curious inertness seemed to have seized
upon Jermyn. He stood upon the threshold of the open windows and
looked out once more into the gardens. Already, since he had
left, there were signs of a change. The thrushes were beginning
to sing, a faint blue coloring hung over the tree-tops. In the
east there was a glimmering line of rose-pink merging into
mauve. All manners of birds were twittering in the shrubbery; a
breath of wind brought him a delicious wave of perfume from the
rose gardens. Jermyn sighed as he turned away. It was, without
doubt, a beautiful world.</p>

<p>Once more the stable clock clanged out. Jermyn fastened the
windows of his room and turned out the lamp. Then he slowly
opened the door and crossed the hall. A light had been left
burning there but it was almost out. The place seemed full of
unseen spaces and the great staircase was only dimly visible.
Very slowly Jermyn ascended.</p>

<p>He reached the second landing and turned to the right, making
his way down a broad corridor. On either side of him were closed
doors; everywhere around, the mysterious silence of sleep. A
former master of the house had collected statuary, and from
several of the small recesses in the walls, the white, chiseled
faces gleamed down upon him. Noiselessly he passed on. About
half-way down the corridor was a turning to the left, and as he
neared it he became conscious of a little current of air. He
moved even more cautiously. He came at last to a complete
standstill. There was a short passage, a window which stood wide
open, and a small balcony. On the balcony Lucille was
standing.</p>

<p>For several seconds he remained motionless. She stood with
her back to him, looking out over the gardens, looking towards
the laurel bushes behind which he had spent a portion of the
night. Jermyn made no sound, even his breathing was almost
inaudible, yet Lucille, seemingly conscious of his presence,
slowly turned her head. In that strange light before the dawn
her face seemed paler than ever, paler, even, than those marble
statues. There was life only in the distended eyes and the
parted lips.</p>

<p>"You!" she whispered.</p>

<p>He moved slowly towards her. He stood by her side upon the
little stone balcony.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is I, Lucille," he said. "Listen!"</p>

<p>He caught her disengaged hand; the other was gripping the
rail of the balcony. For a few seconds they stood so, their
faces turned towards the main corridor. There was no sound to be
heard. Lucille sighed. Already her first terror seemed to be
passing.</p>

<p>"You have not been to bed," she murmured, glancing at his
attire.</p>

<p>"How could one sleep," he answered, "on such a night!"</p>

<p>She looked down at the dew upon his patent shoes and at the
splashes of wet upon his coat.</p>

<p>"You have been out!" she explained.</p>

<p>"In the gardens, only."</p>

<p>"Watching?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. His face was utterly
expressionless.</p>

<p>"What should I watch for?" he muttered. "Is there anything
which we do not know?"</p>

<p>She leaned forward and looked along the front of the house.
She looked at the window which was fourth from the end. It was
within a few yards of them. There was something significant in
her look, but after his first shivering apprehension of it he
turned his head and gazed away over the tree-tops.</p>

<p>"The dawn comes," he reminded her. "Soon the servants will be
astir."</p>

<p>She drew her rose-colored dressing-gown a little closer
around her.</p>

<p>"You are right," she said; "I must go. I could not
sleep&mdash;the whole thing is too awful. I am not sure, Jermyn,
whether I am doing right."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked, hoarsely.</p>

<p>She held up her finger. They both of them seemed transformed
into the likeness of stone images. Their faces were turned
towards the corridor. The woman's hand gripped the rail of the
balcony more tightly than ever. Without a doubt, the sound which
they both heard was the sound of soft footsteps and the trailing
of a light gown. Almost they held their breaths. The footsteps
came nearer and nearer. Without turning her head, Sybil passed
along the corridor, Sybil in a long white dressing-gown, her
fair hair bound up with white ribbon. She was gone in a moment.
She passed without looking to the right or to the left, without
any consciousness of the man and woman who watched. The sound of
her footsteps ceased. The door of her room was softly opened and
closed. Lucille shrugged her shoulders very slightly. She gazed
into her companion's face.</p>

<p>"You knew that she had been to him?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"I knew!"</p>

<p>"You watched from the gardens?"</p>

<p>He pointed below.</p>

<p>"I was behind those laurel bushes for more than two hours,"
he said. "I saw the light in her window; I saw it again flash as
she passed through the anteroom."</p>

<p>"One cannot help but pity her," Lucille murmured. "Think of
the agony of her night! It was her one hope&mdash;she went to
plead for his silence. If he recovers consciousness, Jermyn, do
you believe that he will tell the truth before he dies?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," he answered. "How could any one tell what a
man in his state would do?"</p>

<p>Lucille drew her dressing-gown around her and shivered. The
sky in the east was red now and the dew lay upon the lawns like
frost. In the woods which stretched away from the house, the
thrushes were singing. The stable clock clanged again.</p>

<p>"It is morning," he said.</p>

<p>She laid her fingers upon his arm. Her face was very close to
his. Her expression had softened. In this strange, ghostly light
she was beautiful in a weird, witchlike way of her own.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about Sybil in the future?" she
demanded, under her breath. "I ask you because I must know."</p>

<p>Again he shook his head.</p>

<p>"For two hours last night, in my study," he said slowly, "I
asked myself that question. Down there among the laurel bushes I
watched the moon rise above the trees and I saw it grow pale,
and I asked myself nothing but that one question. I do not
know&mdash;indeed, Lucille, I do not know."</p>

<p>She took his arm. Together they looked out upon this strange,
fantastic world of trees and shadows, of landscape hung with a
mauve light.</p>

<p>"Do you remember," she whispered, "when we were motoring in
the Black Forest in August, you and I and my mother? You drove
all through the night to avoid the heat, and she slept. It was
something like this. We had first the moonlight and then the
spectral light, the lavender and gray twilight. There was just
this same chilly feeling before the sunrise. I asked you a
question then."</p>

<p>"I remember," he answered, uneasily.</p>

<p>"It is when the world sleeps that one can think," she went
on. "Can't you feel it? When every one is laughing and talking
and breathing the air around us, it seems almost impossible to
see things clearly. It is in these long, still hours that one
sees the truth. I, too, have been sleepless to-night, Jermyn; I,
too, have been thinking. Some of my impulses have grown weak.
Second thoughts have come to me."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he demanded.</p>

<p>She turned and pointed down the corridor.</p>

<p>"I have been asking myself," she said, "what there is that I
owe to that girl or to you that I should perjure myself to drive
her into your arms? Why should I shield her? Answer me that. She
has killed a man. Whether she had justification or not matters
nothing to me. Let the courts decide that. I hate her! Now tell
me, Jermyn&mdash;answer me honestly&mdash;why should I shield
her?"</p>

<p>"Because you are both women," he answered, "because you know
that I love her, because it is splendid of you."</p>

<p>She laughed very softly but it was a laugh which made Jermyn
shiver.</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she said, "go back again to that night I spoke of
in the Black Forest. I asked you a question then. You were not
very kind to me but I&mdash;I have never changed."</p>

<p>"Lucille!" he begged.</p>

<p>"Hush! These are the hours in which one speaks the truth.
Plenty of men have told me that they cared, Jermyn, plenty of
men whom the world in which I live might find more attractive
than you. And I wanted you. I always have wanted you. It's the
tiger in me, I suppose, to want what I do want to the death. I
have only to speak the truth and there is no chance in this
world that you and she will ever stand hand in hand again. Why
should I not speak it? Or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or what?"</p>

<p>"Or if I keep silent, why should I not exact my price?"</p>

<p>"Lucille, you are talking wildly," he declared. "You have
been so splendid, so brave, so helpful. You could not go back
upon your words!"</p>

<p>"But indeed I could," she told him. "Now listen, Jermyn. I am
going to my room. At seven o'clock you must come to me. By that
time I shall have made up my mind. Only&mdash;hush, not a word
now. I have finished. Dear, how cold and pale you are!"</p>

<p>She took his face suddenly between her hands and kissed him
on the lips. Then she passed noiselessly away. He waited until
he heard the door of her room open and close. Then he retraced
his steps along the corridor, turned to the left and paused
before a door in the east wing. It was the room at which he had
gazed from below&mdash;the third window on the left. Very slowly
he turned the handle of the door and entered.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="first">The room through which Jermyn passed was dark
and empty, but in the chamber beyond, the best in the house, as
became the pomp and circumstance of his position, Henry
Aynesworth, Marquis of Lakenham, lay dying. Jermyn, who was
admitted only after he had knocked softly twice, stood for a
moment upon the threshold of this fateful apartment. The surgeon
from Norwich had arrived and was talking in earnest whispers
with Dr. Brownrigg. A nurse whom he had brought with him sat by
the bedside. The man who lay there seemed to have turned his
face to the wall. He was either still unconscious or he slept.
There was no sound in the room save the faint murmur of voices
as the two physicians talked together. Jermyn came slowly over
towards them. They moved a little apart at his entrance.</p>

<p>"There is no change?" Jermyn asked.</p>

<p>"None," Dr. Brownrigg replied. "Physically, there will be
none until the end."</p>

<p>"He must die, then?"</p>

<p>"He must certainly die."</p>

<p>"Has he spoken to any one?"</p>

<p>The two doctors exchanged glances. It was Dr. Brownrigg who
answered.</p>

<p>"He has spoken to no one, Sir Jermyn," he said. "Miss Cluley
has been here, begging to be allowed to sit by his bedside, but
the inspector exacted a promise from me that if he refrained
from putting a man in the room, I should allow no one to enter
it save myself and the necessary attendants. I hope you will
explain to Miss Cluley, Sir Jermyn, that I was compelled to keep
my word."</p>

<p>"I quite understand," Jermyn replied, "and I am sure Miss
Cluley will. Naturally, she feels the shock very much. She told
me that she hoped to be allowed to see him before the end."</p>

<p>The doctor bowed.</p>

<p>"The young lady was in great distress," he said, "and it was
very painful for me to have to refuse her request. Under the
circumstances, however, there was no alternative."</p>

<p>"I am sure she will understand," Jermyn declared. "There is
nothing more, I suppose," he added, with a hesitating glance
toward the bed, "that can be done?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," the surgeon answered. "We have eased his
pain&mdash;we could do no more. He may live for a few hours, but
he will grow weaker all the time."</p>

<p>"No longer than that?" Jermyn murmured.</p>

<p>"No longer than that," the surgeon reiterated.</p>

<p>A slight sound came from the bed. Jermyn turned his head. The
man who lay there had opened his eyes and was watching. The
nurse was bending over him.</p>

<p>"I think," she said, turning round, "that he wants to speak
to you, sir."</p>

<p>Jermyn made his way slowly to the bedside. His heart was
thumping. They were all listening. Perhaps this was a foolish
thing which he had done! The man who lay there was pitifully
changed. He had been a coarse, burly, red-faced giant a few
hours ago. Now he seemed to have shrunken. His cheeks had fallen
in, his eyes under his hairy eyebrows seemed to have become
almost fixed in a glassy stare. His voice, loud and stentorian,
the voice which Jermyn had hated, was almost a whisper, yet even
as a whisper it seemed to preserve its discordant effect.</p>

<p>"I'm done, Jermyn!"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," Jermyn declared, with hastily assumed
cheerfulness. "Nothing is certain, nowadays. A specialist is on
his way here. We are hoping that he will be able to do something
for you."</p>

<p>"I tell you I'm done," the man on the bed repeated, almost
sullenly. "I know. Men always know when they're dying."</p>

<p>"We don't believe it," Jermyn asserted. "Still, if there is
any one you would wish to see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not a soul," Lakenham muttered. "There's no one&mdash;who'll
care a damn, there's no one I care&mdash;a damn about! I
used&mdash;to think you were a fool, Jermyn&mdash;to keep the
women at arm's length. I believe&mdash;you're right. They're
devils!"</p>

<p>Jermyn looked half wildly around. The doctors were both
standing within earshot. What was the man about to say!</p>

<p>"Don't talk if it distresses you," Jermyn begged. "There will
be more chance for you if you lie still."</p>

<p>Lakenham opened his lips and closed them again. The nurse
bent over him and wiped his forehead. Jermyn motioned her
nervously away. He pointed to the corner of the room. She obeyed
him with a significant glance towards the doctor.</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;make up my mind," Lakenham went on, painfully,
"whether&mdash;to tell the truth&mdash;or not. The doctors have
been pressing me hard. While&mdash;I lay here dozing, I heard
them speak&mdash;of the police. You don't want&mdash;the police
in the house&mdash;do you, Jermyn?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of that sort matters very much," Jermyn replied
calmly. "If their coming is a necessity, I am prepared to accept
it. I wish you would keep quiet now. I am sure it would be
better for you."</p>

<p>The dying man opened and closed the fingers of his hand,
which lay upon the coverlet. His eyes were fixed upon the
ceiling.</p>

<p>"I can't make up&mdash;my mind. Women are&mdash;devils!"</p>

<p>He closed his eyes. One of the doctors approached the
bedside. He waved Jermyn away.</p>

<p>"You had better leave him now," he whispered.</p>

<p>"He wants to tell me something!" Jermyn exclaimed hoarsely.
"I don't think that I had better go away. He would rather tell
me than any one. He is going to tell us who shot him!"</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>"There is no question about his telling anybody anything
more," he said. "Lord Lakenham is passing away. He will never
open his lips again."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="first">Perhaps, in its way, the final shock of
Lakenham's death brought with it a certain grim sense of relief;
an end, at any rate, of the terrible tension of the last few
hours. Jermyn made his way unsteadily into his own bedroom and
threw himself upon the sofa. For an hour or so he dozed. At six
o'clock a servant brought him some tea. Afterwards, mechanically
he took a bath and changed his clothes. At seven o'clock, he
knocked at the door of the sitting-room of Lucille's little
suite. Her maid admitted him at once. Lucille herself, fully
dressed in plain dark clothes, was sitting at her table, writing
letters. Her eyes followed the disappearing figure of the maid.
As soon as the door was closed, she leaned towards Jermyn.</p>

<p>"It is all over, then?" she whispered. "He is dead?"</p>

<p>"He is dead!"</p>

<p>She drew a little breath. Her tone was unsteady.</p>

<p>"Has he told the truth?" she asked eagerly. "Is any one
implicated? Did he say anything to you?"</p>

<p>Jermyn shook his head.</p>

<p>"He has made no statement at all," he replied. "He spoke to
me. He was hesitating as to how much he should tell. Even as he
was hesitating, he died."</p>

<p>"You are sure that he told the doctors nothing while you were
out of the room?"</p>

<p>"I am quite sure."</p>

<p>Lucille sat for a few minutes with her eyes half closed. Her
lips moved even as though she were speaking to herself. Then she
drew a long sigh and rose to her feet. She went over to Jermyn
and, passing her arm through his, led him to an easy-chair. A
coffee tray stood upon the table.</p>

<p>"Jermyn dear," she said, "I want you to try and pull yourself
together. I know that this has all been very horrible. You have
had two shocks the tragedy of poor Aynesworth's death under your
own roof, and the tragedy of that terrible secret. You will have
to be a man and face it, Jermyn. There is no other way. We shall
need all our courage, both you and I, if that secret is to be
properly kept."</p>

<p>He lifted his eyes to hers. There were black rims underneath
them and his cheeks seemed to have become hollower. The shock
had aged him.</p>

<p>"I shall face it," he assured her. "There is no doubt about
that. The question which concerns me most for the present is
what you are going to do!"</p>

<p>She busied herself, for a moment, making some coffee. Then
she turned and looked at him steadfastly.</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she said, "all the excitement of the last few hours
seems to have left me nerveless. I can talk quite calmly now of
things which, in themselves, sound terrible. I am going to make
a bargain with you."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I am going to speak the naked truth," she went on. "Some of
the things I shall say you may not like. Nevertheless, listen
patiently. I have no love for Sybil Cluley. You are an idealist,
Jermyn, and all your days you will be a little out of touch with
a world which has been fashioned by practical people, and whose
main roads and by-ways lead to the obvious places. Sybil Cluley
is just a little girl upon the stage, who has been clever enough
to behave decently most of her days, and woman enough, when one
of her secrets has been found out, to strike hard for herself
and her future. She isn't what you think her, Jermyn. She isn't
anything at all wonderful. She would have made you a good little
wife, I daresay, and probably she would have settled down here
quite contentedly. She might even have been faithful to you. But
beyond that she wasn't in the least like the woman you ought to
marry."</p>

<p>"I am listening patiently," he remarked, "but I do not agree
with a single word. The woman whom a man ought to marry is the
woman who, in some mysterious way, has made for herself a place
which no other woman could make in the heart of the man who
covets her. There is no universal standard of
suitability&mdash;you must know that yourself very well&mdash;or
all men would desire the same woman. I feel for Sybil what I
have felt for no one else in my life, what I shall never feel
for any other woman. I cannot listen to a single word against
her. I do not believe a single word against her!"</p>

<p>She leaned a little forward.</p>

<p>"You believe&mdash;in your heart you know that she killed
Aynesworth," she declared firmly.</p>

<p>Jermyn opened his lips and closed them again. She leaned a
little closer still.</p>

<p>"I am not sure, even," she went on, watching him closely,
"that Aynesworth, if he spoke to you at all, did not let fall
some word; did not, directly or indirectly, confirm this."</p>

<p>Jermyn covered his face with his hands. A sudden light
flashed in Lucille's eyes. When Jermyn looked up he seemed
older.</p>

<p>"Lucille," he said, "is this worth while between you and me?
Since you force me to it, then, supposing I admit that Sybil did
kill him? It was done in an impulse of madness. You do not for a
moment suppose that I shall not protect her with all my power,
by every means I possess?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that you can do," she replied, "will be of any use
if I choose to speak out."</p>

<p>"But you won't!"</p>

<p>"On certain terms I shall not," she assented. "If you refuse
my terms, I shall tell the truth."</p>

<p>He looked at her doubtfully, still without complete
understanding.</p>

<p>"An hour or so ago," she continued, dropping her voice a
little, "something in the coming of the morning from behind the
woods carried me back to the past so overwhelmingly that I was
compelled to speak to you of a moment which I have thought of
always in my heart with shame. I mean the moment when I begged
for a little of your love. No, don't move away. This hurts you
to listen to, perhaps, but you must listen. When you told me
that you were going to marry Sybil Cluley, you gave me the
cruellest shock of my life. There was nothing left for me. I am
not one of those who can distribute affection, Jermyn. When I
love as I love you, as God knows I love you, there can be no
other man in the world, there can be no life worth living
without you, there can be nothing but misery. Sit still. You
must hear me to the end. Twenty-four hours ago it was all over
with me. I couldn't even make up my mind what I should do with
the wretched fragments of my life. I simply didn't care.
Wherever I looked, I could see no single ray of joy or
happiness, or anything approaching it. The one thing which alone
I desired, hopeless as it seemed then, was to separate you and
Sybil Cluley. Fate has done that for me."</p>

<p>He moved uneasily in his chair. She held out her hand.</p>

<p>"I know what you are thinking," she went on. "I have brought
you face to face with your own problem. You are wondering and
wondering. Now, listen. I am going to solve that problem for
you. I am going to give you no chance of marrying a murderess. I
am going to give you no chance of heroism. If you want to save
this girl from the scaffold, you must marry me and marry me
quickly."</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Lucille!" he cried. "Lucille!"</p>

<p>She rose slowly. She looked at him, looked at him long and
steadily, and his heart sank. Then she continued.</p>

<p>"That is the price of my silence," she told him,
deliberately. "I have no liking, no sympathy, for Sybil Cluley.
If I am compelled to speak, she will very likely escape the
death sentence. She might make a jury believe that she killed
Aynesworth in defense of her honor. She is clever enough, I
daresay. But even if she is fortunate, she will spend the best
years of her youth in prison. I think, Jermyn, that you will
save her from that."</p>

<p>It was significant of the conviction which her words carried,
that Jermyn attempted no argument.</p>

<p>"You are cruel!" he muttered.</p>

<p>"I may seem so," she replied, "but I am not. I am sacrificing
no one and I am doing what every woman in the world has a right
to do; I am striking one blow for the thing which I desire more
than anything else in life. And, Jermyn, I shall make you happy.
You may not think so now but I shall. There is more love for
you, more understanding of you, more real sympathy with you, in
a single beat of my heart than in any of the false words which
that little pale-faced chit has ever hammered out to an
audience of one. Go to the window, Jermyn. You see? There is a
motor-car coming up the avenue."</p>

<p>He followed her finger.</p>

<p>"What of it?"</p>

<p>"Who is in it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"There is a policeman on the box," he answered slowly.
"Inside&mdash;yes, it's Lisgood&mdash;Captain Lisgood."</p>

<p>"The chief constable of Norfolk," she remarked. "Very well,
you have just as long to make up your mind, Jermyn, as it takes
that motor-car to deposit its passengers inside this house. As I
live, I will send Sybil Cluley to take her trial on the charge
of murdering Aynesworth, unless you give me now your hand in
mine and your word of honor to marry me within two months.
Hesitate, if you like, but every second means a risk. If they
come before you have answered me, then I strike."</p>

<p>"I accept," Jermyn agreed swiftly. "I will marry you&mdash;I
promise no more than that, mind&mdash;but I will marry you if
those are your terms. Remember that Sybil is to be spared not
only the worst, but every breath of suspicion or annoyance, so
far as lies in your power."</p>

<p>"She shall be saved from everything," Lucille
declared,&mdash;"from everything."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. Jermyn had turned half away.
Suddenly Lucille moved a little closer towards him. Her voice,
her tone, even her bearing, were suddenly different. Her face
seemed younger; her eyes were shining.</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she whispered, "some day or other, believe me, I
shall be able to make you forget this morning. It is only
because you are a little mad that I have ventured what I have
ventured. If I had believed in your love for her, or her love
for you, believed in it whole-heartedly, I would have saved her
for you&mdash;indeed I would. I'd have been just like one of
that other poor army of fools, who cut out their own happiness
from their heart for the sake of the man they love. But it
wouldn't have been of any use, Jermyn. If this all seems
theatrical to you, and foolish, and wicked, try and believe that
it is only because the circumstances themselves are so
wonderful. We will save little Sybil Cluley and she shall go
back to the profession which she loves, and I am quite sure that
presently she'll settle down happily enough. She can have all
the money or the social recognition she wants. We'll make it up
to her. And, Jermyn, even if you don't believe it now, I shall
teach you to forget her, dear. I shall teach you to feel in your
heart that there was a Providence even in this terrible
happening."</p>

<p>She had come quite close to him now. Her head was lifted to
his, her beautiful eyes were seeking to draw some answering
light; her lips were a little parted, her breath almost was upon
his cheek. He caught her hands and held them in a grip of iron,
but he held her from him.</p>

<p>"Lucille," he said, "I have accepted your bargain. Don't
misunderstand my acceptance. I have listened without protest to
all that you have said about Sybil, but to me she is the one
woman in the world. I have lived a life of which such men as
Lakenham make sport. I am one of those primitive fools who only
believe in loving once. I never cared for any one before I cared
for Sybil; I have never told a woman that I cared for her; I
don't believe that I have ever looked at a woman as though I
cared for her. I gave Sybil my whole heart and she will have it
until the end. I shall marry you to save her from the shadow of
disgrace. I can't see that you'll get much out of it. I promise
nothing beyond the bare fulfillment of that compact."</p>

<p>She raised his hands to her lips.</p>

<p>"They are looking for you downstairs," she murmured.</p> <hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="first">"I call it perfectly horrid," Mary declared, as
she linked her arm through Jermyn's. "We were having such a
lovely time here. I don't want to go a bit."</p>

<p>Jermyn looked down at her pityingly.</p>

<p>"You poor child," he murmured. "It really is hard luck on
you. We were going to have such a good time, weren't we?"</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" she sighed. "Sybil is most frightfully upset,"
she continued, confidentially. "I never saw her look so white
and cold and quiet. I don't think she slept at all last night,
for several times when I woke up I looked across the room, and I
could see her eyes wide open. Was Lord Lakenham a very great
friend of hers, Jermyn?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't that at all, Mary," he said. "Sybil scarcely
knew him. She happened, though, to be the last person who saw
him before it happened and so I suppose she felt the shock."</p>

<p>The child dropped her voice. Although in a much lesser
degree, the horror, too, was in her blood.</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she asked anxiously, "do they know yet who killed
him?"</p>

<p>He looked away from her out of the old-fashioned walled
garden in which they were walking, out across the meadows up to
the tree-topped hills. The insects were droning about them, the
lightest of summer breezes was playing amongst the trees. It
seemed to him that he could hear nothing, think of nothing, but
those few fateful words&mdash;"<i>Willful murder against some
person or persons unknown!</i>"</p>

<p>"No, dear," he answered, "they really don't know anything
about it at all yet. I think that it must have been an accident.
He probably had the pistol in his pocket, took it out to look at
it, and it went off. We won't talk any more about it. It is too
terrible to discuss."</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>"I was having such a lovely holiday and so was Sybil," she
went on. "Sybil has been working so hard and since she came here
she seems to have changed. The day before yesterday she was just
like she used to be, so happy that she was even singing in her
room, singing as she undressed and singing when she got up in
the morning. And now she almost frightens me, she seems so grave
and serious. Jermyn, please, you haven't quarreled, have
you?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least, dear," he assured her. "Why should we
quarrel? Didn't I send you upstairs just now to beg her to come
down?"</p>

<p>Mary nodded doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, and that is one thing I didn't understand," she
replied. "I am quite sure Sybil could have come if she had
liked. There are two maids up there wanting to help her pack and
everything was nearly finished hours ago."</p>

<p>"Tell me what she said exactly?" Jermyn asked.</p>

<p>"She said she would be down in about half-an-hour. The
Duchess was up there with her. Is it very horrid of me, Jermyn,
not to like the Duchess? I suppose she is a very grand lady, but
she frightens me."</p>

<p>"I am afraid our likes and our dislikes," Jermyn replied,
"are rather beyond our control."</p>

<p>"Here comes Mr. Norden Smith!" Mary exclaimed. "Isn't he
funny, Jermyn! He told me such droll stories at luncheon-time. I
think I like Americans."</p>

<p>Mr. Norden Smith was in motoring attire. He removed his
goggles and took off his glove.</p>

<p>"I couldn't leave the neighborhood," he explained, "without
looking in once more to say good-by. I am exceedingly sorry, Sir
Jermyn, that I should have blundered in upon you at such an
unfortunate time. I am off now to Lincoln to-day and up to
Durham tomorrow. There's nothing more I can do, eh?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," Jermyn assured him. "Thank you all the same. I am
much obliged to you for attending the inquest. It was rather
hard luck on you to have to stay in the neighborhood an extra
day when you have so little time to spare on this side."</p>

<p>"A matter of no consequence at all," Mr. Norden Smith
declared; "absolutely of no consequence. To tell you the truth,
the affair interested me professionally. I have never seen
anything of the sort over here."</p>

<p>He fell into step and strolled along with them. Jermyn turned
to Mary.</p>

<p>"Mary, don't you think," he suggested, "that if you went and
told Sybil I was very anxious indeed to see her a little time
before she left for the station, that you might hurry her
up?"</p>

<p>"I'll try," the child promised. "I'll do my best,
anyway."</p>

<p>She tripped across the lawn. Mr. Norden Smith nodded
approvingly as he watched her.</p>

<p>"Nice child, that," he remarked. "Miss Cluley's sister,
eh?"</p>

<p>Jermyn assented. Mr. Norden Smith was still watching Mary on
her way to the house.</p>

<p>"She dances like the sunshine," he declared; "light on her
feet as a fairy, isn't she? Just like her sister used to be at
her age, I should think."</p>

<p>"They are very much alike," Jermyn agreed.</p>

<p>"I must say," Mr. Norden Smith continued, "that the manner in
which Miss Cluley gave her evidence to-day was something
wonderful. Not a tremor, not an indiscreet word; not a syllable
too much, not a syllable too little; just the right amount of
agitation. It was a triumph. A very clever young actress, I
imagine, Miss Cluley. I only regret that I never happen to have
seen her on the stage."</p>

<p>Jermyn's tone became a shade colder.</p>

<p>"I do not connect Miss Cluley's proficiency on the stage," he
said, "with her deportment to-day. Today she was simply a
charming and well-bred young woman, forced into a very
unpleasant and painful situation. She told the truth
simply&mdash;she could do no more nor any less."</p>

<p>"Quite so," Mr. Norden Smith agreed, dryly. "Why, that's all
right. By the by, Sir Jermyn," he continued, glancing around,
"as we are here quite by ourselves for a moment or two, I must
confess that I have felt just a little curious about those
trifles we collected from the floor. I feel a sort of right to
mention the matter, you know, because it was through me that
they were collected, wasn't it? Miss Cluley was so certain in
her evidence that there had been no disagreement of any sort
between her and Lord Lakenham. Was Miss Cluley, by any chance,
wearing a white or ivory satin gown last night?"</p>

<p>"I do not remember the color of her gown," Jermyn replied,
stiffly.</p>

<p>"Silly of me to mention it, perhaps," Mr. Norden Smith
declared, swinging his spectacles slightly between his fingers.
"As a criminal lawyer, however, I must say that the proceedings
this morning interested me very much. There are not very many
people who could possibly have committed that crime, and yet
there doesn't seem, at present, notwithstanding the fact that
your coroner, as you call him, handled the case in an
exceedingly able fashion, there doesn't seem to be a shred of
evidence against anybody."</p>

<p>"That is the general opinion," Jermyn assented, gravely.</p>

<p>"Not a single shred of evidence," Mr. Norden Smith repeated.
"Well, it's a queer thing, isn't it? Everything in such a narrow
compass, too. Seems odd to me that I should have stumbled up
against an affair like this."</p>

<p>"It is strange indeed," Jermyn admitted. "In your country, I
suppose, such tragedies are a little more common. I must say one
reads about these things in the paper and the impression left is
a very faint one. You feel, somehow, that they belong to another
world. When anything of the sort absolutely happens under your
own roof, though, it gives you sensations and emotions quite
incredible. Sometimes I can't believe, even now, that poor
Aynesworth is really gone, killed by some one in my billiard-room.
People are beginning to talk already of the Annerley
murder case; and it's only a few hours ago that the poor fellow
was with us and in boisterous spirits."</p>

<p>"I suppose he must have made himself objectionable to some
one," Mr. Norden Smith remarked. "It's the fashion to be
secretive, nowadays. One can't tell, even in one's own little
circle of friends, whether two men whom you have known all your
life are really attached to one another, or whether there is not
a deadly enmity beneath their daily politeness. Say, I'd like to
leave you my address, Sir Jermyn. I can't see that there is any
way in which I can be of any further service to you in this
matter, but in case you did want to communicate with me at any
time, here you are. Brown, Shipley &amp; Company, if I am in
London or anywhere in Europe; and Manhattan Club in New York.
You should take a trip to the States, Sir Jermyn."</p>

<p>"If ever I do," Jermyn replied, "I will return your call, if
I may, under I trust more auspicious circumstances."</p>

<p>"We'll give you a bully time," Mr. Norden Smith assured him,
holding out his hand. "Now I am off, if you'll allow me. I am
planning to get to Lincoln to-night, if only my tires hold out.
My regards to the little girl and my respectful compliments to
Miss Cluley. If I thought she'd take it in the right way, I
should like, as a criminal lawyer, you know, to convey to her my
heartiest congratulations upon the way in which she went through
that little ordeal this morning."</p>

<p>Mr. Norden Smith took his place in the car, which was waiting
in front of the house, paused for a few moments to light a
cigar, and drove off. Jermyn turned away to find Mary coming
towards him.</p>

<p>"Sybil will be in the library in five minutes," she
announced,&mdash;"not the ordinary library, you know, but your
little study, where you and she read the play. She doesn't want
to come out in the gardens. I think she is afraid that the sun
is hot and she has a headache. You'd better go in there now and
wait for her."</p>

<p>"You're a dear, Mary," Jermyn declared.</p>

<p>"You'll come and see us in London, won't you?" the child
begged.</p>

<p>"Of course I shall," Jermyn promised. "I hope&mdash;yes, I
hope," he continued, "that before very long you will be here
again."</p>

<p>Mary sighed.</p>

<p>"If you knew how I hated to go away! London is so hot and
stuffy. Hurry, Jermyn, please. If Sybil gets there first,
perhaps she won't wait. I have to go and get my hat on."</p>
<hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="first">Jermyn passed up the steps, across the cool,
dim hall and into his own little study, where less than
forty-eight hours ago he had sat with Sybil and talked of the play and
their future, and the wonderful life they meant to live
together. It seemed as though this were another world in which
they were living to-day, as though the people who belonged to
the last one had changed into shadows, as though the sunlight
had become moonlight, and all the splendor and joy of life
itself had ceased to beat in his pulses, and his heart itself
had grown cold. Always, too, there was that hideous sense of
depression sitting like a dead weight upon his shoulder, a
strange, sickening sense of apprehension which kept him
suspicious always of the slightest change or movement in his
surroundings. He began to wonder whether life was going to be
like this always. The few times in which he had dared to think
of the future had filled him with something like terror.</p>

<p>He sat at his desk and looked out into the room which so
often during the hours of his work he had peopled with fancies
and beautiful thoughts and dreams and hopes. Always he had been
an idealist; perhaps, for the complete success of his work, a
little too much so. He had hoped for the best, he had believed
in the best. He had conceived and written always with the
stimulus of the born optimist. This sudden plunge into the cold
waters was terrible for him. He sat in his place with bowed
shoulders, and his brain seemed empty which only a few days ago
had teemed with joyous visions. As he waited there the seconds
seemed like minutes and the minutes like hours. She was coming
and he had no idea what he should say to her. It couldn't be the
same Sybil who was coming. Even though she stood by his side,
even though her fingers rested upon his shoulders and her breath
fell upon his cheeks, it couldn't be the same! Would his pulses
beat, he wondered, as in the old days? Would his heart leap with
the joy of her presence? Would his physical self, at any rate,
respond to her coming? These seemed such idle questions, yet as
he sat there he wondered, wondered without hope, with little
more save a dull and hurtful curiosity.</p>

<p>When at last she came, it seemed, indeed, as though she were
a very different person. All the lightness and the grace and the
buoyancy appeared to have passed away from her. She was still
and pale and cold. Her eyes seemed larger and they were
encircled with black rims. Even Mr. Norden Smith would have
admitted that at least she was not acting now. She came a little
way into the room and a new sensation thrilled him, a sensation
which he welcomed eagerly. Anything was better than the dull
lethargy from which he had been suffering. The rush of pity
which came from his heart even dimmed his eyes. He rose eagerly;
she waved him back.</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she said, "Mary tells me that you are anxious to
see me alone for a moment before we go. I am not sure that it is
wise but you see I have come."</p>

<p>"Not wise!" he repeated. "Oh, Sybil!"</p>

<p>She closed her eyes as though to shut out the sight of
him.</p>

<p>"Dear Jermyn," she went on, "please do not think that I want
to ignore those things which have passed between us. Nothing can
ever change them, nothing can ever make me feel differently, but
you and I both know that a new thing has come into our lives, a
new knowledge which we both share. It is no longer possible for
us to speak of our love. It is better for us to try and ignore
it."</p>

<br>

</div>

<br>

<p>"Sybil," he pleaded,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, no, dear!" she interrupted. "Don't make it harder for
me. I think that you and I both understand. I think that we are
both capable of judging an action broadly and
generously&mdash;forgivingly. But that isn't everything. We each
have a terrible consciousness in our hearts, a consciousness
which we shall never be able to get rid of. The best thing we
can do is to steal away and fight our battle alone. I could not
come to you; you must not come to me. Give me your hands,
Jermyn."</p>

<p>She held them in hers almost passionately. The relief of
tears shone in her eyes, her lips trembled even into a faint
smile. He took her cold little fingers in his. His heart ached
with a passionate desire to draw her nearer and nearer, yet it
never occurred to him to yield. There was something between
them, something invisible, something against which he was
powerless.</p>

<p>"This is hard for us both," she continued softly. "I never
dreamed that I could know such happiness as I felt only
forty-eight hours ago. Thank you for it, Jermyn. It was too
wonderful altogether. Now it is gone. It will never come back; it
can never come back. The shadow of that terrible thing must rest
between us always. I never dreamed how awful a tragedy death
might be."</p>

<p>Again she closed her eyes. She swayed a little on her feet.
It was almost like a moment of yielding. A torrent of passionate
words rose to his lips. He felt a sudden strength, a sudden wild
desire to tear down this intangible, hateful barrier. No matter
if he were thrown back time after time, he felt a wild desire to
rebel. Then the door was quietly opened. Lucille entered...</p>

<p>Lucille paused upon the threshold for a few brief seconds.
Then she closed the door behind her and slowly advanced. She
looked from one to the other and her eyes were full of
mysterious yet anxious sympathy. Perhaps of the two women she
was at that moment the greater actress, for she had entered the
room with a sickly fear at her heart which found no expression
in her well-chosen words. She adopted the most fitting, the most
kindly pose. She was simply the friendly hostess.</p>

<p>"I really hate to interrupt," she said softly, "but if Miss
Cluley must catch that train to town&mdash;it is the last, by
the by&mdash;I am afraid that she ought to be going. It is
already twenty minutes past three."</p>

<p>Their feet were back again upon the earth. The exultation of
the moment had passed, the necessities of life were
paramount.</p>

<p>"I most certainly must leave at once, then," Sybil declared
hastily. "I had no idea that it was so late."</p>

<p>"The car is at the door," Lucille told her gently. "Your maid
and the luggage have already gone on."</p>

<p>Sybil held out her hand. The terror was once more in her
eyes. Jermyn's heart ached for her. Words between them were like
simple pathos; the tragedy of her coming and going was too
great.</p>

<p>"Good-by!" he said.</p>

<p>She gave him one look and turned away. Lucille began to talk
as they left the room&mdash;the grave, considerate chat of a
hostess. Mary pounced upon them in the hall and took Jermyn by
the arm.</p>

<p>"Dear Jermyn," she begged, "please promise that you will ask
us down again very soon? And give my love to the freckle-faced
boy, please, and tell him I was sorry not to see him again."</p>

<p>"I'll remember," Jermyn assured her.</p>

<p>"And you'll come and see us very, very soon, won't you?" she
persisted. "Sybil will want you to, so shall I. And I'm ever so
glad," she whispered in his ear, "that you're going to marry
Sybil."</p>

<p>He swung her up into her place, with a kiss and a light word
of farewell, and breathed a sigh almost of relief as the car
swung away. Sybil's veil had fallen but for him it concealed
nothing of the misery underneath. He stood quite still upon the
steps, looking after them steadfastly. He scarcely noticed
Lucille's arm stealing through his. She looked at him anxiously.
Perhaps she realized that not the least difficult part of her
task was still before her!</p>

<p>"Be thankful, Jermyn, that it is no worse," she murmured.</p>

<p>He turned upon her almost fiercely.</p>

<p>"Worse? What, in God's name, could be worse?"</p>

<p>"The prison van instead of your new <i>Napier</i>," she
answered, with purposeful brutality.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="first">"What was the verdict?"</p>

<p>"Willful murder! What else could it be?"</p>

<p>Jermyn rose to his feet calmly enough and left the club
smoking-room without undue haste or any outward signs of having
overheard the conversation which had been carried on within a
few feet of him. Nevertheless, the two men looked at one another
a little ruefully.</p>

<p>"I had no idea that Annerley was behind that paper," one
remarked. "I am afraid he must have overheard."</p>

<p>His companion shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"He must be used to that sort of thing," he declared. "He's
not the kind of fellow to care about the limelight, either."</p>

<p>"Hate it, I should think. One rather admires his pluck, under
the circumstances. I hear his new play is coming on very soon
with Sybil Cluley in the principal part&mdash;that is if nothing
happens between now and then."</p>

<p>The man who had introduced the subject, smiled.</p>

<p>"What should happen?" he demanded. "After all, no reasonable
person connects either of them with the affair. No motive, for
one thing."</p>

<p>His companion, who was younger, and therefore more of a
cynic, raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"One never knows," he said. "I think I'd answer for Annerley
myself, but Sybil Cluley is a puzzle to every one. One doesn't
know where to place the young comedy actress without a
history."</p>

<p>"That's your beastly point of view," his older friend
declared. "Have a drink?"</p>

<p>The fragment of conversation which he had overheard stirred
no new emotion in Jermyn. Its own dramatic qualities and the
omnipotence of the halfpenny press, had chosen to make the
murder of Lord Lakenham a <i>cause cilhbre</i>. The sensation
was only now, after nearly six weeks, abating a little for sheer
lack of fuel. There seemed to be nothing more to write about. To
all appearance the police had dropped the case. Only those
immediately concerned knew better. Jermyn himself was conscious
of a ceaseless surveillance. Sybil was subjected to something
even more rigorous. These two alone, perhaps, knew that there
was no slackening in the hunt. And at Scotland Yard, Inspector
Fielden, who was in charge of the case, had made one dogmatic
statement from which he was wholly disinclined to budge.</p>

<p>"The affair was done by an amateur," he pronounced. "It was
done under circumstances which make adequate evidence
exceedingly difficult to obtain. It was done by an amateur,
however, and sooner or later the inevitable will happen, history
will repeat itself&mdash;that amateur will give himself or
herself away. Any one can commit a crime; no one can conceal all
traces of it forever but a person with the instincts of a
criminal."</p>

<p>Jermyn left the club without any clear idea of where he was
going. He had spent several hours already, earlier in the day,
in his study, trying in vain to write. The thought of an
immediate return to it was suddenly hateful. Then he thought of
Lucille; he remembered his duty to her. He had not seen her for
many days and her presence was, at any rate, always soothing.
Slowly he made his way to Grosvenor Street, where she had a
small house. It was almost his first spontaneous visit to her
since his return to London.</p>

<p>Lucille was at home and he was ushered at once into her
dainty little drawing-room. She was dispensing tea to two
visitors when he entered, both of whom seemed to Jermyn, whose
nerves were all on edge, a trifle over-cordial in their greeting
of him. It was as though they wished him to understand that
although they were aware of certain unpleasant rumors, they were
prepared to disregard them and to range themselves on his
side.</p>

<p>"This is indeed an unexpected honor, my dear Jermyn," Lucille
declared, smiling, as she handed him some tea. "I am really glad
to see you. I was going to ring you up this afternoon."</p>

<p>She touched his fingers fondly as they met. Her eyes were
soft and bright with pleasure. For a moment he allowed himself
to be sufficiently distracted from his dejection to watch her
admiringly. She certainly gratified his sense of the
picturesque, both as regards her own personality and her
environment. She wore a long jacket of black silk, with a little
ruffle of white lace at her throat and a great bunch of pink
roses drawn carelessly but very effectively through her
waistband. Her face seemed to have lost its occasionally hard
expression and her eyes their furtive anxiety. She seemed
somehow younger, seemed to have temporarily abandoned her more
matronly pose and returned to the slim, less assured elegance of
girlhood. Her setting, too, was beautiful. The little drawing-room
with its soft gray coloring and finely selected French
furniture, was famous not only for its treasures but for their
tasteful arrangement. Despite a certain reluctance which he
could scarcely analyze, Jermyn, from the depths of the easy-chair
into which she had gently forced him, watched his hostess
and was conscious of a sense of serenity which certainly the
club, and more certainly his own rooms, failed in those days to
afford him.</p>

<p>"I do love to see my friends comfortable at this hour of the
day," Lucille murmured, after she had insisted upon the
easy-chair. "I like to see them lounge. Complete repose is such a
stimulus to natural conversation. I have always noticed that
people who are sitting in uncomfortable chairs, with a cup of
tea in one hand and a plate upon their knees, talk, if they talk
at all, in a stilted, unentertaining fashion."</p>

<p>Lady Florence Effingham nodded approvingly. Mrs. Starr
Hamilton, who was the other caller, smiled.</p>

<p>"Your theory, then, is that a state of repose is conducive to
entertaining conversation?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely," Lucille admitted; "especially to teatime
conversation."</p>

<p>"Are there special features, then, about tea-time
conversation?" Jermyn inquired.</p>

<p>"Naturally," his hostess replied. "Tea-time conversation
should be of the nature of gossip; good-natured always, if
possible, and leading the way to confidences. One doesn't look
for epigrams or smart talk at this hour of the day."</p>

<p>"I'm quite sure you are right," Lady Florence agreed. "I
shall increase my stock of easy-chairs at once and perhaps my
tea-parties will become as popular as yours. Tell me, Lucille
dear, what are your plans for the autumn? Are you going to stay
in town or go to Scotland, or go abroad early? I wish you would
come to us at Blicklyn."</p>

<p>"My plans are scarcely made yet," Lucille answered, after a
momentary hesitation. "I am not sure&mdash;it depends."</p>

<p>She glanced across at Jermyn, who was talking with Mrs. Starr
Hamilton. A sudden swift and splendid impulse leaped into her
brain. Why not? Jermyn had come to her of his own accord. He
seemed in an acquiescent, almost an appreciative mood. It was
time that she struck. Perhaps this was the best way. She was
instinctively convinced that the moment was propitious.</p>

<p>"I do not know that I ought to give away our little secret
just yet," she said softly, glancing across at Jermyn with a
faint suggestion of half apologetic inquiry in her tone and the
lift of her eyebrows. "However, I suppose it doesn't matter very
much, and Florence is one of my oldest friends."</p>

<p>Lady Florence sat suddenly upright in her chair.</p>

<p>"My dear! You don't mean to say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I do," Lucille interrupted. "Jermyn and I are going to
be married very soon indeed."</p>

<p>There was something in Jermyn's eyes for a moment which would
have startled either of his two fellow-callers if they had been
looking his way. Lucille saw it and went cold. After all, had
she made a mistake?</p>

<p>"My dear&mdash;my dear Lucille!" Lady Florence cried, holding
out her hands. "You have taken my breath away. I'm sure I
congratulate you both most heartily. I am delighted."</p>

<p>"And I, dear Duchess," Mrs. Starr Hamilton echoed sweetly. "I
cannot pretend, unfortunately, that I know either of you as well
as Lady Florence does, but you must let me wish you every
possible happiness. Such a suitable match, too! Really, I cannot
imagine why we never thought of it before, except, of course,
that no one ever does marry the people you expect them to."</p>

<p>Lady Florence had turned to Jermyn.</p>

<p>"My heartiest&mdash;truly, my heartiest congratulations, dear
Jermyn!" she exclaimed, emphatically. "You know what I think of
Lucille, don't you? There is no one quite like her. You are
indeed fortunate."</p>

<p>Jermyn had risen to his feet. There was nothing left of that
glitter in his eyes but his voice sounded hard; there was no
real feeling in his words.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much, Lady Florence," he said. "Thank you,
too, Mrs. Starr Hamilton."</p>

<p>Not a word more, no reference whatever as to his good
fortune. There was a certain grimness, also, about his
appearance, which had a repressing effect upon the storm of
questions which the two women were prepared to launch. For a few
moments he was left outside the circle. Lucille, apparently
quite at her ease, and with just a shade of most becoming color
in her cheeks, chatted with her callers almost in an undertone.
Presently they took their leave. Jermyn escorted them to the
door and, under cover of a second edition of congratulatory
speeches, they at last departed...</p>

<p>Lucille was awaiting Jermyn's return, standing upon the
hearthrug, her elbow upon the mantelpiece, her head resting upon
her hand. She turned eagerly towards him as he entered. Her eyes
were soft and bright and full of fire, her pose exceedingly
graceful, her little gesture of appeal rendered entirely natural
by that slight access of real fear from which she was indeed
suffering.</p>

<p>"Jermyn, you are not angry with me? Tell me that you are not
angry with me," she pleaded. "It had to be done soon, you know,
and I have waited. I had hoped that it might have come from
you."</p>

<p>He closed the door deliberately behind him. Then he came over
to her. Her heart began to sink. She was at her best and she had
failed to move him. There was not a single spark of admiration,
or feeling of any sort save suffering, in his hard, thin
face.</p>

<p>"You mean to take your pound of flesh, then?" he asked,
wondering a little at the sound of his own voice, which seemed
to come from a great distance.</p>

<p>"You are not polite," she murmured.</p>

<p>He flared up. The sudden impulse of passion was good for him.
Even she was not sorry to see it. The icy tension of the moment
was broken.</p>

<p>"What, in God's name, has politeness to do with it?" he
demanded. "Truth is the only thing worth counting between you
and me. I do not want you, Lucille. I'm not a woman's man and
your good looks and your subtle poses are nothing to me. I am
one of the people of this generation in whom you don't seem to
believe. I love one woman and I can love no other."</p>

<br>

<p>"A murderess!" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Call her what you like," he went on fiercely. "You call
yourself a woman of the world, you pretend to know things, you
talk always as though life had yielded to you the keys of her
secret chambers. Don't you know as much as this?&mdash;that when
a man's in earnest, the woman he loves may be a poisoner, a
sinner, a very Borgia, if you will, but she is none of these
things for him&mdash;not for him. She is just the woman he
loves&mdash;that's all that counts. There isn't anything
else."</p>

<p>A little breath came through her teeth. Her face was very
white, her eyes shone.</p>

<p>"I should like to be loved like that!" she cried softly.</p>

<p>"Then find some one who'll do it," he retorted, with a note
of savagery in his tone. "Don't you know me well enough,
Lucille, to understand that I haven't the gift of partition?
Where love is concerned I am the narrowest person who ever
breathed. Sybil is the first woman I ever cared for and she will
be the last."</p>

<p>The light was passing from Lucille's face. She seemed
suddenly tired and older.</p>

<p>"Do you mean, Jermyn, that you would marry Sybil Cluley
to-day?"</p>

<p>"If she would have me, I would," he answered readily. "In the
study at Annerley, the day she left, I would have asked her but
for our compact."</p>

<p>She turned her back upon him for a moment. Then she laughed
shortly.</p>

<p>"You amaze me," she declared. "Jermyn Annerley, scholar, man
of letters, an aesthete, a humble disciple of Epicurus, an
aristocrat! What about the obligations of race and character
now, my dear Jermyn?"</p>

<p>"There is at least no obligation for me to stay here and
listen to your tauntings!" he exclaimed, turning away. "I have
discovered what I came to find out&mdash;you mean to hold me to
your infernal bargain!"</p>

<p>"For your own sake, without a doubt," she answered firmly.
"You shall never marry Sybil Cluley. Furthermore," she added,
"if you take my advice you will keep away from her. I suppose
you know that she is watched night and day?"</p>

<p>"Is that part of your work?" he demanded.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"My dear Jermyn," she replied, "if I opened my lips at all,
the watching would soon be over! If I did my duty and spoke just
half a dozen words, Sybil Cluley would spend to-night in prison.
Be careful that you don't try me too far. Be careful,
Jermyn!"</p>

<p>For a moment they both stood quite still. Her bosom was
heaving, her eyes flashing. She faced him without quailing and
there were cruel things in her face. He turned and left the
house.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="first">Jermyn had rooms in Mount Street, to which he
made his way immediately after leaving Lucille. The house in
which they were situated was an old one, and the rooms
themselves were unusually large and somberly furnished. His
study was separated from his sleeping apartment by old-fashioned
folding-doors. The hangings, pictures and upholstery were all
severe in tone and a little gloomy. Nevertheless, the whole
place was very much more to his taste than the apartments to be
obtained in modern and more luxurious flats. When he was in
residence for some time, the abundance of topical literature and
reviews, the flowers which were sent up daily from Annerley, the
general air of habitableness produced by these means, pleasantly
relieved the severity of his study. It possessed, even, an air
of its own, which he found soothing and into which he seemed to
fit.</p>

<p>His servant met him in the hall. Parkes, too, was an
importation from Annerley&mdash;a serious-faced, conscientious
servant, but a confirmed pessimist.</p>

<p>"Mr. Levenden, sir, has been ringing up from the theatre
three or four times," he announced. "He would like to speak to
you at once on the telephone."</p>

<p>Jermyn allowed himself to be relieved of his hat and stick
and made his way into his study. The telephone, almost the only
note of modernity in the apartment, stood by the side of his
easy-chair. He rang up the theatre and asked for Mr.
Levenden.</p>

<p>"I understand you want to speak to me, Mr. Levenden," he
said, as soon as a familiar voice from the other end had
answered his first inquiry.</p>

<p>"That's so, Sir Jermyn," was the prompt reply. "I do want to
speak to you particularly&mdash;matter I am most anxious
about."</p>

<p>"Concerning the play?" Jermyn asked.</p>

<p>The voice at the other end hesitated.</p>

<p>"Yes, concerning the play&mdash;indirectly. I wonder whether
you could possibly come round for a moment. I called to see you
early this afternoon, and I am so infernally busy just now.
Besides, the rehearsal isn't over."</p>

<p>"I will be round in ten minutes," Jermyn promised.</p>

<p>Action of any sort was a relief to him. He walked to the
theatre, indulged in his distaste for meeting friends and
acquaintances in those days by choosing the by-ways so far as
possible, still a little numb from the shock of Lucille's
declaration and the realization of the price which he was called
upon to pay for Sybil's salvation.</p>

<p>He passed through the stage door after a respectful greeting
from the commissionaire, and made his way towards Mr. Levenden's
room. As he crossed the back of the stage he came to a sudden
standstill. The rehearsal was still in progress. He heard the
sound of Sybil's clear, mocking laugh, followed by his own
lines:</p>

<p>"Dear Henry, for a man of your experience you are certainly
very ignorant of women and their ways. Nature paid us an unkind
trick when she dealt out the counters, when she made men
ingenuous and women subtle. You trust too easily, my friend. The
best woman in the world will look you in the face and lie for
the sake of the man she loves, and the better woman she is, the
more convincingly she will do it."</p>

<p>Jermyn stole on tiptoe to where he could catch a little
glimpse of the company upon the stage. With a sudden thrill he
passed the end of a piece of scenery which had concealed Sybil.
She had just completed her speech and was laughing into the face
of the man to whom she had made it. From where he stood she
seemed unchanged. She was fashionably dressed, and the little
fur toque with its scarlet quill sat jauntily on her wealth of
soft brown hair. She had thrown herself entirely into her part.
She had forgotten. For a moment he almost envied her her
profession.</p>

<p>Jermyn found Mr. Levenden in his room, signing letters, and
Mr. Levenden was unfeignedly glad to see him. He wheeled up an
easy-chair for his visitor, placed cigarettes at his elbow, and
himself closed the door behind his secretary, whom he bustled
out of the room.</p>

<p>"This is rather like the mountain coming to Mahomet, Sir
Jermyn," he declared. "It's awfully good of you to come round
like this. I can't tell you how much I have to do these
days."</p>

<p>"It was perfectly convenient for me to come," Jermyn assured
him. "I can't pretend to be a busy man like you. What's the
matter? Anything gone wrong in rehearsal? Perhaps you'd like me
to take one this week? I suppose I ought to, really."</p>

<p>"It isn't that," Mr. Levenden replied. "We are always glad to
have you there, you know, but just at first, while we go through
the groundwork of stage directions, that isn't so important.
Your manuscript and author's notes are always so clear. It's
another little matter that's bothering me."</p>

<p>Jermyn took up a cigarette and lit it.</p>

<p>"If I can be of any service," he murmured.</p>

<p>"The part of 'Nora'," Mr. Levenden pronounced, "is an
exceedingly difficult one."</p>

<p>"Surely not too difficult for Miss Cluley?" Jermyn
interposed, smiling.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," the manager assented, hastily. "Please
don't misunderstand me. On the contrary, it bids fair, so far as
one can tell at present, to be one of her greatest
successes."</p>

<p>"Then what is the trouble?"</p>

<p>"It is such a good part," Mr. Levenden continued, "and it
suits Miss Cluley so marvelously well, that I am at my wits' end
to find an understudy who could even speak the lines, much more
act them. So far, I may tell you, Sir Jermyn, I haven't come
across any one who'd be the slightest use, and without going to
the 'stars' I scarcely see where I am going to find her. 'Nora'
is Miss Cluley and Miss Cluley is 'Nora'. Without her it would
be simply hopeless."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>The manager moved uneasily in his chair. He was always a
little afraid of this strange young man, who seemed to have
wandered into theatreland from some region which he, at any
rate, knew nothing about. Jermyn's face during the last few
moments had grown very austere. He had, perhaps, some
premonition of what was coming.</p>

<p>"The long and the short of it is, Sir Jermyn," Mr. Levenden
said at length, "that there's been a lot of talk about that
unfortunate affair down at Annerley, and during the last few
days there have been persistent rumors, rumors one can't afford
altogether to neglect."</p>

<p>"Concerning whom?"</p>

<p>Jermyn's words were like drops of ice but the manager was not
unduly sensitive. Besides, it was a matter of business with
him.</p>

<p>"Concerning Miss Cluley. I was told this morning by some one
upon whose word I can generally rely, that Miss Cluley would be
in prison within a week."</p>

<p>Jermyn stood quite still. The fingers which held his
cigarette did not even tremble.</p>

<p>"You can't believe such rubbish as this, Mr. Levenden," he
protested.</p>

<p>"I don't want to believe it," Mr. Levenden retorted, eagerly.
"I am bound to face facts, though, and there is this big, black,
ugly one standing straight in front of me, and that is that if
this rumor should turn out to be even founded upon the truth,
then all the money I put into the play will be lost. I can't
afford to risk such a situation, Sir Jermyn, and that's the
truth. I've had other losses."</p>

<p>"If this is how you are feeling, Mr. Levenden," Jermyn said,
"I am glad that you have sent for me. Let me tell you, as one
who should know something about the facts, that your fears are
entirely ridiculous. There is no more chance of Miss Cluley's
being arrested on this charge than there is of my being called
upon to answer for it myself. I am surprised that you should
have listened to such foolish rumors. It is absolutely
impossible to connect Miss Cluley with the death of Lord
Lakenham in any way whatsoever."</p>

<p>Though Levenden seemed somewhat relieved, he was not wholly
convinced.</p>

<p>"There's a great deal of talk," he insisted, "and I don't see
where it all comes from."</p>

<p>"It comes from people who know nothing whatever about the
matter," Jermyn declared. "Lord Lakenham and Miss Sybil Cluley
were, to my certain knowledge, on the friendliest of terms. They
had only met the day before, and Lord Lakenham was already her
admirer."</p>

<p>The manager drummed with his fingers upon the desk before
which he was sitting.</p>

<p>"There is a persistent rumor, Sir Jermyn," he pointed out,
"that such was not the case. I have heard it stated most
confidently that Lord Lakenham had known Miss Cluley in her less
prosperous days, in the days before she came to London."</p>

<p>"We can none of us be responsible for rumors, Mr. Levenden,"
Jermyn said coldly.</p>

<p>Mr. Levenden felt that he was scarcely getting on, but the
thought of his closed theatre acted as a stimulus.</p>

<p>"I can assure you, Sir Jermyn," he went on, "that I most
sincerely hope that it is so. No one could have a greater
respect and regard for Miss Cluley than I have, and her behavior
at all times, both in the theatre and out of it, has been
entirely and exceptionally irreproachable. At the same time, the
police make mistakes sometimes and I cannot afford to put all my
eggs in one basket. I want to take this opportunity of asking
you, Sir Jermyn, how you would regard a proposition to transfer
Miss Cluley's part to Ida Hamilton, provided, of course, we
could induce Miss Hamilton to accept it?"</p>

<p>"I can answer you very briefly," Jermyn replied, without a
moment's hesitation. "I would sooner put the manuscript of my
play upon the fire than have it appear under such
circumstances."</p>

<p>"Miss Hamilton has a large following," the manager persisted.
"She is, as you know, quite one of our most brilliant actresses,
and she has had experience. I believe that she would make a huge
success of the part."</p>

<p>"The question of Miss Hamilton's capacity does not interest
me," Jermyn remarked. "My play was written for Miss Cluley and
she alone will play the part of 'Nora'. I trust that you have
not hinted anything of this to her?"</p>

<p>"I have not said a word," Mr. Levenden assured him hastily.
"Of course, if that is your feeling there is no more to say
about it. We must hope for the best, although I must admit that
I am anxious."</p>

<p>"What would your loss be in the event of the theatre having
to close for the reason you suggest?" Jermyn asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Levenden shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Anything up to four or five thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"I take the responsibility," Jermyn promised. "If the run of
the piece is stopped, or if it is never produced through
anything happening to Miss Cluley of the nature you suggest, I
take the losses upon my shoulders. I will be content to accept a
statement from your accountant as to the amount."</p>

<p>Mr. Levenden drew a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Sir Jermyn," he said, "you are behaving like a prince. You
have taken a big load off my shoulders."</p>

<p>Jermyn rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"You have been anticipating trouble quite needlessly, Mr.
Levenden," he declared confidently. "By the way, I propose
attending rehearsals myself next week. Will you see that I get
the calls?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure,&mdash;Sir Jermyn&mdash;with pleasure!" Mr.
Levenden assented, making a note upon a memorandum tablet.
"Mount Street still, I suppose? I am only too glad you are
coming. To tell you the truth, you know, that was another point
which was exciting a little comment. Before her visit to
Annerley Court, this very unfortunate visit, you and Miss Cluley
were a great deal together. Since this affair we have scarcely
seen you at the theatre. I have heard it said that since that
time you have not been seen to speak to her."</p>

<p>Jermyn frowned.</p>

<p>"I had no idea that such comments would have been made," he
said. "I have not been in London very long. The reason I have
perhaps seen less of Miss Cluley is that I have recently become
engaged to the Duchesse de Sayers. If such remarks as those to
which you allude have been made, however, I shall take an early
opportunity of setting matters right."</p>

<p>"I congratulate you, I am sure," Mr. Levenden ventured,
"congratulate you most heartily. Upon my word, it's rather a
relief to hear you so confident about Miss Cluley. As nice a
young lady as ever breathed, quiet and a real worker. It would
be a horrible shame to have her upset in any way."</p>

<p>Jermyn took up his hat.</p>

<p>"If they haven't all gone," he remarked, "I should like,
after what you have told me, to see Miss Cluley for a few
minutes."</p>

<p>"An excellent idea," Mr. Levenden agreed.</p>

<p>The two men walked out together. The rehearsal itself was
over but every one was talking cheerfully together in a corner
of the barely-lit stage. Sybil had just taken leave of the
others and was on her way out. Jermyn, with a word of farewell
to the manager and a wave of the hand to the rest of the
company, hurried after her.</p>

<p>"Miss Cluley&mdash;Sybil!"</p>

<p>She turned quickly around and stood for a moment quite still.
In the gloom of the ill-lit place, with its cavernous shadows,
she appeared to him to look like a ghost. He realized in that
moment something of the anguish through which she had passed.
They held hands for a moment almost in silence. Then, conscious
of the little group at the further end of the stage, they
commenced to talk banalities. In the narrow passage outside,
Jermyn felt suddenly weak. The slight perfume of her hair, her
familiar clothes, her close presence, all affected him
powerfully. He took her hand and drew her unresistingly towards
him.</p>

<p>"Dear!" he murmured. "Dear Sybil!"</p>

<p>Her eyes shone into his like stars. They were alone and he
seemed caught up on the wings of a new passion. A splendid
recklessness possessed him. He held her tightly to him and
kissed her on the lips.</p>

<p>"Don't, dear Jermyn," she implored,&mdash;"don't!"</p>

<p>He released her at once. She was making a piteous little face
at him but somehow he felt the better for that single wild
moment. He felt, too, that at the bottom of her heart she also
was glad of it.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he said, "or rather I am not sorry. I want to
talk to you, Sybil. May I take you home?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I am not going home," she told him. "I am meeting Mary at a
tea-place and afterwards we are going to the <i>Gaiety</i>."</p>

<p>"Where is the tea-place?" he inquired. "I can take you there,
at any rate."</p>

<p>"In St. James's Street."</p>

<p>He sent the commissionaire for a taxicab and handed her
in.</p>

<p>"It is quite time I saw Mary myself," he declared, "and
before I go I have something to tell you."</p>

<p>"News?" she asked, suddenly paling.</p>

<p>"Not that sort of news," he answered hastily. "Nothing
about&mdash;it."</p>

<p>She leaned back in the cab with a little sigh of content.</p>

<p>"Don't let's talk at all just yet," she begged. "Sit by my
side&mdash;like this. I want to rest, to try and imagine for a
moment that nothing has happened at all except a
nightmare&mdash;a long, awful nightmare. Humor me, dear,
please."</p>

<p>He obeyed at once, only he took her hand and held it in his.
So they rode in silence through the busy streets, her eyes
shining as she looked steadily ahead, he most of the time
watching her, so slim and quiet&mdash;to-night, it seemed to
him, so fragile. Then they drew up suddenly before
<i>Rumpelmayer's</i>. She looked like a child awakened from a
dream. A policeman, walking slowly by, glanced into their cab.
His heart ached as he saw her little start of fear, saw the old
look creep momentarily into her eyes. Then she saw him watching
her and a little smile, piteous though it was, parted her
lips.</p>

<p>"I am foolish, am I not? Never mind," she added, bravely,
"those five minutes were worth having."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="first">Mary and a severe-looking maid were waiting for
them upon the pavement. The former welcomed Jermyn with a little
cry of delight.</p>

<p>"You bad, bad Jermyn!" she exclaimed, with real reproach in
her tone. "But oh! it is good to see you again!"</p>

<p>Jermyn held the child's hands tightly in his.</p>

<p>"You'll have to forgive me, Mary dear," he begged. "I haven't
been in London so very long, you see, and here we are together
again at last, anyhow."</p>

<p>"You're going to have tea with us?" she insisted.</p>

<p>"Tea!"</p>

<p>Jermyn glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"Tea at this time of the evening! Do you know that it is
nearly seven o'clock?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't get away before," Sybil explained, "and anyhow,
we girls are not such slaves as men are to meals at regular
hours."</p>

<p>Jermyn smiled.</p>

<p>"Well, I propose dinner&mdash;dinner, say, at the
<i>Milan</i>, in the grill-room, with ices and boxes of
chocolates afterwards. What do you say to that, Mary? Isn't that
better than tea and sugared cakes?"</p>

<p>"I say, yes!" Mary decided promptly. "I think it would be
just lovely. I've had tea, really, hours ago."</p>

<p>"Are you sure that you can spare the time?" Sybil asked. "And
what about your own engagements? Aren't you dining
anywhere?"</p>

<p>"I'm dining with you," Jermyn declared. "Somehow, I felt an
undue sense of exhilaration creeping over me a little time ago.
I must have known. Come along&mdash;here's a taxi."</p>

<p>"Couldn't we go to a quieter place than the <i>Milan</i>?"
Sybil suggested, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"The child will like it," Jermyn said. "Besides&mdash;I have
another reason for going there. Let it be the <i>Milan</i>, if
you please, and let us," he went on, lowering his
voice,&mdash;"let us make believe a little longer, Sybil. You
and I and Mary are just going to forget."</p>

<p>Mary's ears and her intelligence were alike sharp. She
overheard and clapped her hands.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" she cried eagerly, "let us forget all about Lord
Lakenham! I don't think he could have been really nice or he
wouldn't have made so much trouble."</p>

<p>Sybil looked at her reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Mary!"</p>

<p>"Don't be shocked, please, Sybil," the child continued. "I
can't help it. Everything was so beautiful before and everything
has been so dull and miserable since."</p>

<p>"To-night," Jermyn interposed quickly, "it is going to be
beautiful again. I agree altogether with Mary. It is our duty to
be cheerful. While Mary drinks ginger beer, we will drink
<i>Pommery</i>. We will eat and drink and be merry and forget
the end of the quotation."</p>

<p>They reached the cafe and were received at once by the chief
<i>mantre d'httel</i> with many bows and expressions of
pleasure. They selected a table in a corner which was not too
inconspicuous, and Jermyn took up the menu.</p>

<p>"We will consult Henri here about our dinner," he declared.
"There must be chicken, of course, and chocolate ice, and for us
sensible people, Sybil, what do you say? <i>Sole ` la
Normandy</i>? What do we eat?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure that I have not forgotten," Sybil answered. "I
think that Mary mostly gives the orders at home."</p>

<p>Jermyn gave some brief instructions to the waiter.</p>

<p>"And <i>Pommery Brut 1904</i>" he wound up. "And now tell me
about this young lady! When does she go to that
boarding-school?"</p>

<p>Mary made a wry face.</p>

<p>"I wish you hadn't reminded me," she complained, a little
dolefully.</p>

<p>"Mary is going to Brussels to-morrow," Sybil said. "I know
that she is going to be very happy and I am sure that it is best
for her. Of course, I shall miss her more than I can say, but
there is nothing for her to do at all when I am at the theatre,
and there is so much rehearsing just now."</p>

<p>"There are always holidays," Jermyn remarked cheerfully.
"There are always, too, trips to Brussels. One can get to
Brussels very easily, nowadays, you know."</p>

<p>Mary clapped her hands.</p>

<p>"You will come," she cried,&mdash;"you and Sybil, too? Oh,
you must!"</p>

<p>"We will come," Jermyn promised. "Don't be afraid of that,
little lady. We will come and charm you from behind those gray
stone walls and show you some of the vanities of life. It is, I
presume, a modern establishment to which Mary is going?"</p>

<p>"Fairly modern, I think," Sybil agreed.</p>

<p>Mr. Levenden passed by with a party of friends, and stopped
to greet them in some surprise. Others of the company were
there, too, and at a table only a few yards away, a hard-featured,
commonplace looking man with a black moustache, who
looked a trifle out of place in such surroundings, sat eating
his dinner with a paper propped up before him, yet with his eyes
wandering often around the room. He never seemed to glance
towards either Sybil or Jermyn, but once they exchanged a look
and they knew. Jermyn tossed off a glass of wine.</p>

<p>"My attendant," he whispered.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Surely mine! I see him wherever I go."</p>

<p>He leaned towards her. Mary's attention had been distracted
by the entrance of some American children, with bows of enormous
size in their hair.</p>

<p>"Dear," he said, "sometimes I wish I had talked to you more
openly. What I want you to believe is that they may watch and
watch and suspect, but the thing is dead. There is no more
evidence to be swept up. The cleverest men in the world would
only find all the doors locked. The shadow is terrible, lying
across our path all the time, but the danger is over there is no
more danger."</p>

<p>"You really believe that?" she asked, with a little gasp of
relief.</p>

<p>"I am sure of it," he answered. "For the rest, I wish I could
take away even those other and darker thoughts. You know as well
as I do that Lakenham was not a good man. You know as well as I
do what sort of a bargain he was trying to drive. Such a man
invites reprisals. It is part of the game he plays and part of
the risk he runs."</p>

<p>She closed her eyes for a moment. When she opened them again,
however, something of the haggard suffering seemed to have
passed from her face.</p>

<p>"I am glad we have spoken of this," she said.
"Tonight&mdash;no, not to-night, perhaps, but very soon&mdash;I
am going to tell you of that chapter of my past which Lord
Lakenham recalled to me, and which drove me almost mad with
terror. You shall know, Jermyn, and you shall judge. After all,
it doesn't matter very much now, does it?"</p>

<p>Mary once more claimed their attention. From that point their
little feast became almost uproarious. They chatted of the play
and its possibilities; they talked nonsense as they might have
done a few months ago. For that hour, at any rate, they had
stepped out of the shadow. The man who looked over his paper and
watched them every now and then, saw nothing in their faces of
brooding care. To all appearance they were the lightest-hearted
little group in the place.</p>

<p>At a few minutes past eight, Jermyn drove with them to the
<i>Gaiety</i> and left them at the door. Sybil turned round to
wave her hand as they disappeared. The old delightful smile had
parted her lips; her eyes shone into his. There was even a dash
of the old coquetry in the way she carried her head, in the
swing of her exquisite figure. Jermyn stood on the pavement for
a moment or two after they had disappeared. Then he turned away
and drove to his rooms...</p>

<p>That night a very demon of unrest possessed him. He had no
engagements and he had proposed to spend the evening over some
work he was doing for a review. His efforts to settle down,
however, were all in vain. His brain was full of torturing
thoughts. Out of the shadows, Lucille seemed continually to come
and mock him with her smooth, cold voice, the curve of her lips,
the gleam of her eyes, passionate yet minatory. He heard her
calm yet graceful announcement of their engagement, the little
ripple of interest, the pressure of the fingers, the honeyed
words of those women who only that afternoon had forced their
congratulations upon him. Then he saw Lakenham, cold and dead;
saw the small ivory pistol which Lucille had secreted; saw the
fragments of Sybil's gown upon the floor; saw her crushed roses
lying by the side of the murdered man's hand; saw her still,
cold face the first time they had met afterwards. All the
happiness of the evening seemed to pass away like breath from
the face of a mirror. He could forget no longer. He was a prey
to torturing thoughts. The kiss which he had given her burned
upon his lips. He thought of her as she had stood upon the steps
of the theatre, smiling at him innocently, joyously, with that
wonderful lure in her eyes which a French critic had once raved
about.</p>

<p>He tried to read but it was in vain. His pulses seemed to be
beating at fever heat, his temples were throbbing. He threw open
the window. Although it was now early October, it was a soft,
warm night. There were stars in the sky, a yellow moon, the
faintest movement of the trees in the distant square. Dimly he
could hear the roar of the city. The sky southwards was stained
with the reflection of its million lights. He had wasted hours.
The theatres were emptying now. He could see her driving
homewards, leaning back in the taxi, thinking, perhaps, of him.
He could see the whole procession of carriages and cabs, the
throngs in the streets, the great pleasure-loving, pleasure-sated
crowd passing backwards and forwards to the gayly-lit
restaurants, or to their homes, to whatever feast might await
them upon the table of life. And he sat there alone with his
books, without any human being to bear him company. A crowd of
unfamiliar thoughts came rushing into his brain. After all, he
was a man like the others. His was the same birthright, even
though he had not chosen to fritter it away in small love-affairs,
in the flirtations of salad days. Yet he was not
different from others. Deep down in his being there was a
passion as strong and compelling as it is given to any man to
feel; chained, perhaps, by reason of a certain discriminating
fastidiousness, a religious sense of offering it in its
entirety, but tearing now at its chain wildly, madly. Some
breath of wind, a strain of music, a fragrant memory, perhaps
the lingering sweetness of that kiss upon his lips, had brought
him an evil turn. As he stood there, he felt the slow fire
burning up in his veins. There was but one woman in this world
for him, whether he died to-morrow or lived to the full measure
of his days. Weren't the by-ways of the world filled with men
whom opportunities had passed by? His hand crept to his
waistcoat pocket. Once more he felt the key which Mary had asked
him to keep for her as they had entered the restaurant. A crowd
of bewildering, magnificent, quivering thoughts struggled into
his mind. He thrust them down, only to find them leap up again,
stronger and stronger every time. He stood like a man at bay,
fighting with some unchained thing in his life of whose very
existence he had scarcely dreamed. A prig, some men had called
him, because he had been a clean liver; a cold-blooded sort of
chap, a well-known theatrical manager had once said of him at a
supper-party. Both accusations were true, perhaps, in their way,
but Jermyn knew now that his time had come. Again and again he
threw himself into his chair and struggled with his work. It was
the very vainest of efforts. Some new power possessed him; some
new, invincible force was stupefying his will.</p>

<p>He rose and crept out into the hall. Silently though he went,
Parkes heard him and glided to his side.</p>

<p>"You are going out, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>"For a little time," Jermyn answered.</p>

<p>"Will you dress, sir? Your things are all ready."</p>

<p>Jermyn shook his head.</p>

<p>"I will go as I am. Get me my coat and hat."</p>

<p>He passed out into the night. The air was-soft, the broad
streets were packed with motor-cars and taxicabs and electric
broughams. Women in snowy-white opera cloaks, be jeweled,
beautified by the impression which was all one could gather of
them, leaned back amongst the cushions; well-satisfied men sat
by their sides. A boy and a girl drove by in a hansom, with
their arms unblushingly around one another. There were couples
walking arm in arm along the pavement, and whispering as they
went. It was some devil that was in the atmosphere that night,
some witchery which had started the call to which for so long
his blood had failed to respond. He hailed a passing taxi and
jumped in.</p>

<p>"Burley Court," he told the man.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="first">Sybil drew the reading lamp a little nearer her
and opened a copy of her part. Her little flat was on the
topmost floor of the building and at eleven o'clock the street
outside was almost deserted. Her maid had gone to bed. Sybil's
solitude was immeasurable and complete. The very quietness
beguiled her thoughts away from her work. Calm and self-composed
though she tried to remain throughout the days, it was these
lonely hours which she sometimes feared. To-night the battle
was to begin afresh. She felt them coming, all those demons of
regret and memory against which she seemed to be fighting always
a losing battle. She rose to her feet and looked half wildly
around her. If only there could be escape!</p>

<p>The clock ticked steadily on, a little piece of coal fell on
to the hearth and sizzled out. There was no sound upon which she
could focus her attention, no way of escape from the thoughts
which were already quickening the beating of her heart. Then
something happened, something entirely unexpected. The lift
stopped at the flat below. Some one stepped out and commenced to
ascend the few remaining stairs. Sybil glanced at the clock. A
visitor at such an hour was an impossibility. She moved to the
sitting-room door and stood with it open in her hand, waiting
for the bell. But there was no bell. A key was fitted into the
lock; the door was slowly opened. A little cry broke from her
lips, a cry which died away before it was half uttered. It was
Jermyn who entered.</p>

<p>Her lips faltered his name. She gazed at him in blank
astonishment. He closed the door behind him; then he came softly
towards her and passed by her side into the sitting-room. All
the time her eyes never left his face. There was a change there,
something she did not understand.</p>

<p>"Mary gave me her key to take care of to-night," he
whispered.</p>

<p>"But why have you come&mdash;now&mdash;at this time of
night?"</p>

<p>His eyes told her. There was a new thing there, something
which half gladdened and half terrified her.</p>

<p>"Because I couldn't help it!" he cried hoarsely. "Because I
couldn't keep away! All the time this key has been burning in my
pocket, and there is something which you must be told, something
which was there before me like a black shadow all the time we
sat at dinner, something I have tried to strangle but can't,
something I must tell you to-night."</p>

<p>"Something more?" she faltered. "Oh, my God! Something
more?"</p>

<p>"I am going to marry Lucille de Sayers."</p>

<p>She shrank a little away yet she did not seem to wholly
understand. There was a certain stricken horror in her face but
her chief expression was still one of bewilderment.</p>

<p>"You are going to marry the Duchesse de Sayers&mdash;to marry
her? I don't understand, Jermyn."</p>

<p>"I am going to marry her," he muttered, "very soon."</p>

<p>"There is some reason for this?" she asked, with trembling
lips.</p>

<p>"There is," he answered.</p>

<p>"You must tell me at once," she insisted,&mdash;"at once,
mind. I thought that I had enough to bear, but this&mdash;! Tell
me, why are you doing it?"</p>

<p>"Because she knows!" Jermyn said slowly.</p>

<p>Sybil for a moment was stupefied; her brain seemed to refuse
to work. Then she began to laugh&mdash;a queer little unnatural
sound.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;she knows," she repeated. "Jermyn, you must
write a melodrama about it. Do things really happen like
this?"</p>

<p>"It is the price of her silence," Jermyn went on. "I couldn't
believe her myself at first but she is in earnest. She knows and
she insists."</p>

<p>She drew Jermyn towards a chair and seated herself on an
ottoman by his feet.</p>

<p>"You poor man!" she murmured, with quivering lip. "If only I
had never come on that ill-fated visit! Jermyn, doesn't it seem
all too horrible? That man&mdash;oh, how terrified I have been
of him! He is dead, so what I am going to say must sound
horrible, and yet it is the truth; it is my one consolation both
by day and by night. He was a brute&mdash;he was not fit to
live."</p>

<p>"You are right," Jermyn admitted, almost eagerly. "It was the
pendulum of justice which swung. Aynesworth deserved his fate.
Yet you and I must carry the burden of it on our shoulders all
our days."</p>

<p>"Does she know," Sybil asked, "that you&mdash;that you do not
care?"</p>

<p>He laughed hardly.</p>

<p>"She knows," he reminded her, "that on the morning of that
day I told her that I was the happiest man on earth because you,
the only woman I had ever loved, had promised to marry me. She
knows at least that I am not capricious."</p>

<p>"Is it that she cares, do you think?"</p>

<p>"In her way," Jermyn replied,&mdash;"yes, in her way she
cares."</p>

<p>"How did she&mdash;find out?"</p>

<p>"Her hand was down at bridge. She walked along the terrace,"
he answered wearily. "Oh, she knows right enough! And, Sybil,
she isn't quite like other women. She isn't altogether English,
you know. She is full of queer passions and humors. I believe
that she was on the very point of telling the truth that
night."</p>

<p>Sybil covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>"Sometimes it all seems too much for me," she said quietly.
"Night after night I sit here and the torturing thoughts come,
and it seems to me that no one was ever so miserable, that no
one ever could be so unhappy. Now there is this&mdash;you are
going to marry!"</p>

<p>"Don't talk as though it were a matter of choice, for God's
sake!" he exclaimed. "I marry to save&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't!" she interrupted.</p>

<p>"I marry to keep a bargain, then," he went on. "I marry to
seal that woman's lips. I wish to heavens I had wrung her neck
before I had ever let her come to Annerley!"</p>

<p>Sybil in those few moments looked like a woman for whom the
storms of life were over, a woman who had suffered so greatly
that she had passed through to the other side. She was very
quiet and very pale; her voice seemed to have become monotonous;
she seemed to be speaking and thinking mechanically.</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she said, "in the future it is quite certain that I
shall not see very much more of you. Tonight, then, I will tell
you something that has been in my mind. I will tell you why I
was terrified to death of Lord Lakenham; I will tell you why he
transformed me into a madwoman that awful night in the
billiard-room."</p>

<p>"Yes," Jermyn assented, "let me hear! Not that it makes any
difference now, but between us, at least, let there be absolute
truth."</p>

<p>"My success on the stage," Sybil continued, "was a fluke. For
six months before my engagement at the Imperial Theatre, I was
more or less half starved, and all that time Mary was terribly
ill. The worst month of my life was when I was with a little
stock company at Blackpool. You remember the page I cut out of
the illustrated paper? Yes, I can see you remember. It was
because that month at Blackpool was mentioned. It was before
Lord Lakenham remembered. Blackpool would have brought it all
back to him."</p>

<p>"You understand," Jermyn interrupted hoarsely, gripping at
her hand,&mdash;"not a word unless it is your own wish to tell
me?"</p>

<p>"It is my own wish," she assured him. "It is all very
humiliating but it is not so terrible. It is my own wish to tell
you the whole truth. Somehow, as I sit here," she went on, her
eyes fixed upon the fire, "I seem to have lost all the ordinary
feelings of life. Even if it were worse, I could tell you and
feel very little. Lord Lakenham was at Blackpool. It was before
he came into the title, but he was well known. He made friends
with the manager of our company. You know what such men are.
Lord Lakenham was a little god to him. He was allowed to wander
about our theatre as he liked. Unfortunately, he ignored
everybody else but he took a fancy to me. It was the affair of a
moment only with him&mdash;just one of these hateful impulses
which come to a man of his type&mdash;but he pursued me all the
time; I had seldom a moment's peace. I was half starved, and in
the midst of it all the doctor told me that unless Mary was
taken to London and operated upon, her spine would probably go
wrong, she would never be able to stand up or run about like
other girls; and, above all things, that I must give her
nourishing food and plenty of it. All the time I felt my own
strength going, and I was earning twenty-five shillings a week!
I got into debt and Mary grew worse. I want to tell you this
story in as few words as possible so I won't pile on the
miseries. All the time Lord Lakenham was pursuing me. All the
time, too, he was behaving with devilish cunning. When I had no
idea where to look for a meal, he sent baskets of hothouse
roses. When I was longing for beef-tea for Mary, he filled my
sitting-room with mimosa&mdash;or would have done if I hadn't
thrown it into the street. At last the end came. One Friday our
manager wasn't there. The show was finished, there wasn't a
penny for anybody. Lord Lakenham came to the rescue. He gave
every one the money to get back to London and then he turned to
me. What was there left? I borrowed fifty pounds from him and
told him he could come to London in a fortnight and&mdash;and I
would repay him."</p>

<p>For the first time her voice broke a little. Jermyn had gone
white. It seemed to him that a live hatred was blazing in his
heart for a dead man.</p>

<p>"I went to London," she continued. "I put Mary into a private
hospital. I paid&mdash;paid everything to start her there
properly. There was a slight operation and in a few days she was
a different child. Then that engagement at the Imperial Theatre
came, by the wildest of accidents. When I opened the papers the
next morning, I could have screamed. I was a success. The
struggle was over. And behind it all there was&mdash;you know
what. Then I made up my mind&mdash;I would not pay. I think that
in my heart I never meant to pay and live. I left my rooms
hurriedly and moved to another part of London. I took no notice
of Lord Lakenham's letters or his telegrams. I hid. I had only
one fear, and that was that he would come to the theatre and
recognize me. I had changed my name, I altered the fashion of
doing my hair, I altered my appearance as much as I possibly
could. I dressed extravagantly and in a different style, on
purpose. I tried to get as far away as I could from the white,
half-starved little girl of Blackpool, in case I should see him
anywhere. At first he wrote me continually. He even advertised
in the theatrical papers. Then his father died, he came into the
title and there was silence. He forgot, of course. I saw him
several times with musical comedy young ladies, but I had passed
out of his mind. I never met him face to face again until that
day on the platform of Wickombe Annerley station when I came to
visit you, and when I saw him there I very nearly turned round
and ran back home again."</p>

<p>Jermyn took a long breath.</p>

<p>"It isn't so terrible, Sybil," he said quietly.</p>

<p>She was satisfied. They both, for a moment, reveled in a
feeling of comparative content.</p>

<p>"In a way, it isn't," she confessed, "but I never sent him
back the fifty pounds. I was afraid. I soon saved the money but
I couldn't tell how to let him have it so that he couldn't trace
the sender, so I gave it to the Actors' Benevolent Fund
anonymously, with his initials."</p>

<p>He shook his head at her although his eyes were kind.</p>

<p>"Little girl, little girl," he said, "why didn't you tell me
the whole story directly you arrived at Annerley? I could only
see that you were terrified. It is all harmless enough. Life has
its terrible side for some people, and fate chose to set you
down in a hateful place. You couldn't have done anything
else."</p>

<p>"Oh, I was a fool not to tell you!" Sybil confessed. "I wish
you could have seen into my heart. It was you, dear Jermyn, of
whom I was afraid. Can't you understand, too, that in those
first days, in those first hours of that wonderful life, when
you told me that you cared and all of a sudden everything was so
changed, the thought of Lord Lakenham and his admiration was
like a hateful, a hideous discord? You were so different,
Jermyn, and mixed with all my love was just a little fear of
you. I had always hoped that there were some few men in the
world like you, but you were the first whom I had met, and I was
afraid that when you heard of those ugly days, I should come
toppling down in your thoughts. You know that I have been good,
dear&mdash;you would believe that&mdash;but you have so much
beautiful sentiment. I felt that even the thought of those
things and of Lord Lakenham would somehow destroy the beauty of
those first few days."</p>

<p>"My dear," he murmured, "am I not human like other men? Could
you really have thought me such an intolerable prig?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I was wrong&mdash;wrong!" she admitted sorrowfully. "I
just went by the way I felt. I wouldn't think&mdash;I wouldn't
use my brain. But, of course, it was a fallacy. Because we were
living in a paradise, it was foolish to imagine that one could
shut out the knowledge that many people in the world like Lord
Lakenham live in pig-styes. But I was so happy to have found my
little corner in life, and I was so terribly afraid of losing
it."</p>

<p>She was sitting on the arm of his chair now, her hands
clasped, her eyes fixed upon her interlocked fingers. He leaned
over her, his fingers touched her shoulder. The room was going
round. What business had men to plan their lives with their
brains? Those might do that who were immune against the great
forces of the world.</p>

<p>"Sybil," he whispered, "it's all terrible, but tonight, as I
sat in my room, something came to me, some new thing, something
I don't understand even now. Only it seemed so big and it made
everything else seem so small. I couldn't keep away from you. I
felt that I must tell you everything and tell you this. Sybil, I
have promised nothing but my name, I will give nothing but my
name. Sybil, for me all my days, for all the days of my life,
there is no other woman but you!"</p>

<p>She shivered a little. He dropped on one knee by her side.
The consciousness of her near presence set him quivering like a
boy, his arm half hesitatingly went around her waist.</p>

<p>"Dear," he went on, "look up. There isn't anybody else in the
world I love, there isn't anything else I shall ever desire
except you&mdash;your kisses, the feel of your arms, the light
from your eyes. There is no one else with whom I could ever walk
in the gardens of Paradise."</p>

<p>She was trembling violently. Her hand stole out as though to
keep him away.</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she faltered, "we aren't like that&mdash;you and I.
Oh, I have loved you so much because I know that you belong to
the wonderful world, and it's the world I have struggled so hard
to keep my little place in through all the troubles!"</p>

<p>"Should we lose it?" he demanded. "Once I should have
answered very decidedly, but that was before I cared, before I
knew what a wonderful thing love is, love which comes but once
in a lifetime, which one knows is eternal. There isn't a thought
comes now from my heart worth having, Sybil, that hasn't a
little of you in it. There isn't a beautiful place I can look
into without finding it empty unless you are there."</p>

<p>She turned her head; she looked at him wildly. Her lips were
quivering, her eyes were full of the strange things.</p>

<p>"Jermyn!"</p>

<p>He caught her into his arms. His lips followed hers as her
head sank back. Then they heard a little voice quite close, and
a little clapping of hands.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!"</p>

<p>For a moment they remained as though turned to stone. Slowly
Sybil opened her eyes, raised her head and looked around. Mary
was standing in the open doorway of the room, in her nightgown.
She beamed upon them with the air of one who has made a
delightful discovery.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad that you two are friends again!" she
exclaimed. "I thought I heard voices and I just peeped in to
see. You didn't even hear me open the door. You silly people! I
do believe that you've just made up a quarrel."</p>

<p>She came a little further into the room, helped herself to an
apple from a dish, and sat and looked at them, swinging her
slippered feet.</p>

<p>"I am so glad, really," she went on, "because, Jermyn, you
will be able to look after Sybil, won't you, while I am away at
boarding-school, and she won't be nearly so lonely then."</p>

<p>"Yes," Jermyn answered, "I shall be able to do that."</p>

<p>"Whatever made you come so late at night?" the child asked,
selecting a place to bite at her apple.</p>

<p>"I came to bring back the key you gave me to take care of,"
Jermyn reminded her.</p>

<p>"What jokes!" Mary exclaimed, gleefully. "I didn't ask for it
back, on purpose. I thought perhaps you'd have to come. But I am
glad that you and Sybil are quite, quite friends again. You are,
aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we are," he answered. "I think that we can promise her
that, can't we, Sybil?"</p>

<p>She smiled at him without meeting his eyes.</p>

<p>"Of course, I expect I shall like boarding-school," Mary
continued, "because I love having other girls to play with and
talk to and that sort of thing, but the one thing that spoiled
it all was that I was so afraid that Sybil would be very lonely
when I was gone. Now I shall feel quite, quite happy. Watch me,
Jermyn!"</p>

<p>She threw the core of her apple into the heart of the fire
and looked at him triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Don't you wish you could throw in as straight as that every
time?" she asked. "Jermyn, are you going to see me off to-morrow
from Victoria?"</p>

<p>"I will if I possibly can," he promised. "And I
think&mdash;"</p>

<p>He glanced at the clock and stretched out his hand for his
hat. Sybil's eyes suddenly met his and there was a wonderful
look in them.</p>

<p>"We'll both let him out, Mary, and then I must put you to
bed, dear," she said.</p>

<p>Jermyn laid the key upon the table. Mary locked her arms
through his. Sybil walked gravely by his other side but when
they reached the door she gave him both her hands. He stooped
and kissed her upon the forehead.</p>

<p>"Dear," he whispered, "I understand&mdash;I know."</p>

<p>Then he kissed Mary and they closed the door upon him. Sybil
stood quite still for a moment, listening to his departing
footsteps. Then she caught Mary up in her arms, and her eyes
were full of tears.</p>

<p>"You dear, funny old thing!" Mary exclaimed, as they turned
back to the sitting-room. "All these days and days when you've
been so miserable, you've never cried once, because I've watched
to see; and now tonight when you are happy&mdash;you are
happier, aren't you, Sybil dear?&mdash;look at those silly
tears!"</p>

<p>Sybil smiled as she felt for her handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Life is like that sometimes, dear," she said.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="first">Jermyn received a somewhat imperative note from
his fiancie the next afternoon, and in obedience to it he
shortly presented himself in Grosvenor Street. Lucille welcomed
him with a slight frown upon her beautiful face. She was dressed
for the street and waiting alone in her little drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Of course you know," she told him, "that you are at least
twenty minutes late. If I weren't conscious of having made a
most superbly successful toilette, I should be quite annoyed. I
have been spending the time looking at myself in the glass.
Don't you think that you would like to send the car away and
walk down Bond Street with me?"</p>

<p>She turned slowly around. She was wearing a wonderfully made
gown of soft gray velvet with chinchilla trimming, a hat to
match, and gray shoes and stockings.</p>

<p>"As an artist, now, my dear Jermyn, confess that you never
saw a more beautiful effect," she went on, arranging a bunch of
parma violets at the bosom of her gown. "If you were at all
sensible of the obligations of your position, you would feel an
amazing desire to embrace me upon the spot."</p>

<p>She turned to face him with her arms slightly extended.
Jermyn, without moving, looked at her a little grimly.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately," he said, "I have never been able to
understand the point of view of the man who is able to desire
embraces from two women at the same time. I happen, as you know,
to care for somebody else."</p>

<p>The brilliant, provocative look passed suddenly from her
face. An angry light shot from her eyes.</p>

<p>"It is scarcely in the best of taste to remind me of it," she
declared, quickly.</p>

<p>"My retort," he reminded her, "would be a little
obvious."</p>

<p>She held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Please don't go on," she begged. "There will be time enough
for us to quarrel after we are married. The car is waiting."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," Jermyn said; "I have just come to explain that
I cannot go out with you this afternoon."</p>

<p>She stopped short on her way to the door.</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"I must go to the theatre," he answered. "We have been
obliged to change the hour of our rehearsal to-day. Miss Cluley
had to see her sister off to Brussels this morning. We are
rehearsing at three o'clock instead of at eleven. I am on my way
there now."</p>

<p>"Is your presence at every rehearsal necessary?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not absolutely necessary," he replied. "On the other
hand, it is a great pleasure to me and a compliment which I
think I owe to my artists."</p>

<p>"Do you owe nothing to me?" she demanded. "I promised my
cousins a week ago that you should go to Merchester House with
me this afternoon."</p>

<p>"What I owe to you," he said gravely, "I shall do my best to
pay."</p>

<p>She came over to him, laid her hands suddenly upon his
shoulders and smiled up into his face. She ignored his
impassiveness. Her lips seemed almost to court his.</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she begged, "do not be angry with me. I know that I
am foolish and jealous&mdash;sick with jealousy of Sybil Cluley.
It is foolish of me because I know that you care for her just
now and that you think you don't care for me, but if only I
could make you believe it&mdash;you'll care for me, dear, long
after you've forgotten her. She is just a little flash of
moonshine. She hasn't much of a soul; she isn't much of a human
being, anyway. Jermyn, you can take me with you, hand in hand,
into worlds which would be all strange to her, worlds she could
never even enter. Don't be foolish, please. Don't give away the
best part of yourself to her while I am hungering for you. Don't
come to me as a harsh, unpleasant duty and think of yourself as
a martyr. Am I not as good-looking as she is, Jermyn? People
would tell you so. I know I'm cleverer. She makes herself
attractive because she has all the stage tricks. She can keep
herself in the limelight all the time. It isn't a great gift to
be able to act prettily, you know, Jermyn. You and I used to
agree with Hazlitt. We never believed that the real fire ever
burned in the mummer's heart."</p>

<p>Jermyn remained unmoved. He held his head even a little
higher.</p>

<p>"Lucille," he said, "you treat me as though I were a boy, to
be humored all the time into obedience to your whims. Don't you
think it is a little foolish of you? I am thirty-one years old,
you know. Sybil Cluley may be anything you like to call her.
That is just your point of view. So far as I am concerned, she
is the only woman I have ever cared for; she is the only woman I
ever shall care for."</p>

<p>Lucille shivered but she did not move away. She crept even a
little closer to him, straining as though to take him into her
arms, her eyes pleaded with him.</p>

<p>"Jermyn, all my life I have cared. I have always hoped and
hoped that some day you might care a little, too. Do you blame
me for still believing that you will? There isn't any one who
could make you such a good wife as I shall. I wouldn't bind you
to me if I didn't know this. Use a little common sense, dear.
Sybil Cluley could never be your wife. You know that. So long as
she lives there would always be the shadow."</p>

<p>"Even if I grant you that," he interrupted hoarsely, "what
difference does it make? I care for her just the same. I am not
likely to feel any the kinder towards you because I can't marry
the only woman I care about."</p>

<p>"Dear, it's so impossible, and when things are really
impossible, they generally die away, you know. Think,
Jermyn&mdash;you used to be very proud of your people, dear; you
know them all by name, those last twelve baronets, Lords of the
Manor of Annerley&mdash;statesmen, diplomatists, soldiers and
sailors. They married great ladies, every one of them."</p>

<p>"There is no woman who better deserves her place among them
than Sybil Cluley," he answered.</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed; her lips curled a little.</p>

<p>"Even if you believed that," she retorted, "even if you could
so far forget the obligations of your race as to put a little
comedy actress up there among them, you still couldn't place a
woman there whose hands were red with the blood of one of your
own relations. You couldn't do that, Jermyn."</p>

<p>He gave a little cry. She had raised her voice. He looked
around the room, half terrified.</p>

<p>"You mustn't talk like that!" he exclaimed. "You can't
tell&mdash;some one might have come in!"</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"My dear Jermyn, the very intelligent gentleman at Scotland
Yard who is now worrying over the Lakenham murder case, is as
perfectly convinced in his own mind of the real culprit as you
and I are. The only trouble is that he has no proofs. I am the
only person who can be of any use to him. The only proofs that
exist in the world are in my possession. I am the only person
who could&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped short. Something in his face terrified her. She
walked to the window and returned.</p>

<p>"We waste time," she remarked. "Now will you come with me,
Jermyn?"</p>

<p>"I am due at the theatre," he told her coldly.</p>

<p>"I will drop you there, then," she replied. "At least you
shall leave the house with me and in my car. I will not be
treated as though I did not exist."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," he said. "If you will drop me at the
theatre, I will accompany you, with great pleasure."</p>

<p>"I do it," she went on, as they took their places in the car
and drove off, "under protest, mind. When one makes bargains
with a person of honor, one doesn't trouble to put down every
little condition. All the same, when I made that bargain with
you, at the back of my mind there was always the conviction that
if you accepted the situation at all, you would accept it with
its obligations&mdash;with its reasonable obligations, that is
to say."</p>

<p>"I recognize no obligations," he declared. "I have nothing to
offer that was not in the bond."</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed at him threateningly.</p>

<p>"Are you the only one to talk about the bond?" she demanded.
"Why shouldn't I back out a little if I feel inclined? Do you
think that I want only the cold shadow of your name, that I
intend to be neglected by you all the time? Don't try me too
far, Jermyn. I love you&mdash;I admit that&mdash;I love you and
I can't love anybody else. I don't know why. You're a cold,
strange sort of person. People call you clever but bloodless;
they never forget that at Oxford you were a prig. Still, I care,
but you know there are limits, there are other passions in the
world beside love. Have you never heard of a woman who found
revenge almost as beautiful? Remember I am half a Frenchwoman,
and in my country the passions count for a great deal."</p>

<p>He weighed her words as she spoke them and in his heart he
believed her. He knew quite well that she was capable of
anything.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you this, Lucille," he remarked quietly. "If you
ever did place Sybil's life in danger, do you know what I should
do? I should give myself up. I should swear that it was I who
had killed Aynesworth."</p>

<p>She laughed contemptuously.</p>

<p>"They wouldn't believe you. Besides, I should be there to
swear you didn't."</p>

<p>"I think I can promise you," he said, "that I should make up
a very plausible little case."</p>

<p>She leaned back amongst the cushions.</p>

<p>"Ah, well," she murmured, "we won't be so foolish, Jermyn. We
won't quarrel any more. It is my fault really. Only I wish you
would believe me when I tell you that if these days seem a
little hard for you, the time will surely come when you won't
regret them."</p>

<p>"All my life," he declared deliberately, "I shall regret the
dissipation of the most beautiful dream I have ever conceived,
the shattering of the most beautiful hopes I could ever have in
life. These I shall regret always, even though Lady Annerley is
the most admired woman in London and my house the best
ordered."</p>

<p>"It is a challenge," she answered gayly. "I have had enough
of being serious. We will discuss things no more; we will simply
wait...What dirty streets seem always to be collected around the
backs of these theatres! Jump out, Jermyn. Go and train your
little band of mummers to speak their words and play their
little parts. I'll make the best apologies I can for you at
Merchester House. <i>Au revoir!</i> Tell the man to stop first
at <i>Lucie's</i>."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="first">Jermyn found the little company upon the stage,
awaiting his arrival. He shook hands with Sybil and there was
the light of a new understanding in the smile and glance with
which she welcomed him.</p>

<p>"So the little lady has gone?" he asked.</p>

<p>"She has gone," Sybil replied. "She went off quite
comfortably and in high spirits. One of the governesses from the
school was there to take her over."</p>

<p>"I tried so hard to come down myself," Jermyn explained, "but
it was really a busy morning with me."</p>

<p>"I think, perhaps, it was just as well," Sybil assured him.
"I suppose it really is silly to feel parting with her so much
when one knows it is for her good, but I don't believe we have
ever spent a night away from one another for six years."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will miss her very much," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall always miss her," Sybil sighed. "Still, it was
inevitable. Living in a tiny flat, with so few friends, must
have been rather a poky life for a high-spirited child like
that. One could see the change they made, even those few days at
Annerley."</p>

<p>For the first time she spoke of them without shrinking. She
seemed to carry herself with a new courage. Jermyn nodded
understandingly.</p>

<p>"There will always be the holidays," he said. "Brussels is
really such an easy journey. If she cannot come to you, you will
be able to run over to her."</p>

<p>The producer came down the stage.</p>

<p>"Now, ladies and gentlemen, if you please."</p>

<p>Jermyn made his way into the front row of the stalls and down
in the centre of the shrouded desert of empty seats. Very
mechanically that afternoon he watched his work grow into shape,
criticizing and making a few suggestions only when he was
appealed to by the producer himself or one of the company. The
play for him was Sybil, the stage was full of Sybil. When she
was absent, he lost all interest. Once he smiled to himself with
genuine amusement as he realized how wholly uninspired and
halting his lines in places were when Sybil herself was not on
the stage. His work had indeed been an offering to her. She had
been his inspiration for longer, even, than he had imagined. Was
it to end? Wasn't there really some middle way? Were men and
women all alike in the face of a crisis of this sort? He tried
to think of a single case of permanent and satisfactory
friendship between a man and a woman placed as he and Sybil
were, a friendship against which no one could whisper, a
friendship which carried with it the justification of a real and
convincing sincerity. He remembered hearing the subject once
discussed. "If the man is capable, the woman isn't," the club
cynic had remarked. "As a rule, everything goes on all right
until the psychological moment arrives. It may be the man who
precipitates it or it may be the woman. Flesh and blood haven't
learned to resist it yet."</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the place was a little depressing. The
sordid details of stagecraft began, in time, to irritate him. It
was with a sigh of relief that he heard the producer shut up his
book and dismiss the company with his accustomed speech of
farewell. He met Sybil in the wings and carried her off at
once.</p>

<p>"I am going to take you to have some tea," he declared. "My
own head aches even with sitting listening in that stuffy
theatre, and I am sure you must be tired out. Afterwards, I
shall walk part of the way home with you."</p>

<p>"I should love some tea," she confessed. "It's all waiting
for me at home but I don't think I shall like my first meal
without Mary a bit. Anyhow, I would like to put it off as long
as possible."</p>

<p>They crossed the Haymarket and entered a tea-shop. Jermyn
chose a quiet table and gave an order.</p>

<p>"You will miss her always, dear," he said; "yet, on the other
hand, when you can bring yourself to think of it, it must be a
joy to you to realize what you are able to do for her."</p>

<p>"It is indeed," she assented.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, in a way," he went on gently, "you may feel that
she has already repaid you for some of your care. You know,
Sybil, they say that the sanest of us get strange moments of
madness. I fancy mine must have come last night. I don't think I
was master of myself. I don't think I quite knew what I was
doing. I seemed, somehow, to be possessed. Anyhow, Mary has
exorcised that spirit. I want so much to see you to-day, if it
is only for a few minutes, because I want you to feel that
whatever happens, under any circumstances, Mary has brought me
into the family as her big brother and you will have to let me
play the part."</p>

<p>She turned a little towards him. Underneath the table her
hand touched his and pressed it.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he continued, "one reason why we are not afraid
of death is because we know that it is so utterly and entirely
inevitable. It is not death or something else; it is death
alone. I have thought over our position until my brain reels and
I have come to the conclusion that that, too, is utterly
inevitable. And so I am trying to drive that into my mind, to
make use of all my philosophy and absolutely to make up my mind
to the next best thing."</p>

<p>"Tell me," she asked, "does she&mdash;does the Duchesse de
Sayers speak of me?"</p>

<p>"She has done so," Jermyn admitted. "She knows the truth, of
course. She knows that I care for you. I have told her very
plainly indeed that while life lasts I should care for no other
woman. As yet she doesn't believe it, but in her way she is a
reasonable woman. She makes no attempt to interfere, at any
rate, with our friendship. She had better not."</p>

<p>Sybil caught at his hand suddenly. They were in a dark corner
of the room and there were few people there. Her eyes were wet
with tears.</p>

<p>"Jermyn, dear Jermyn," she exclaimed, with a little choke in
her voice, "I am afraid of the loneliness of it all! Life seems
to have changed so lately. Be my friend&mdash;do be my friend!
We don't want to think of last night&mdash;of possible mistakes.
That won't come again. You you are so different. I am so lonely.
You know the men we meet. I don't want to marry any of them. I
just want to be let live, and to act and to think, and I want
you to be the same to me always. But it's lonely, it's horribly
lonely. I can't even make friends with the women. They bring
men, too, and it's always the same thing. If you were to go
away, if you were to leave me altogether, I don't think&mdash;I
don't think I could bear it!"</p>

<p>He held her hands firmly.</p>

<p>"Dear Sybil," he whispered, "it's a bargain. I am your friend
now and always, your privileged, dear companion and friend. You
can trust me."</p>

<p>She wiped her eyes and leaned back in her chair with a sigh
of content. Their tea was set before them and she poured it out
silently.</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she said presently, "let me tell you this. I feel
happy to-day for the first time since&mdash;since that happened.
Life seems somehow surer and safer again. So long as I have you,
the you whom I love, somewhere in the background to trust, why,
I am not so frightened. You won't go away for too long, will
you?"</p>

<p>"I will not," he promised. "Nothing shall keep me away from
England for more than a few weeks. There are plans which I
have&mdash;but I won't talk about them just now."</p>

<p>"I do hope that she won't mind," Sybil went on. "Oh, I know
you won't give me up altogether but I'd like her not to mind. In
a way you can't be happy and satisfied unless you and she get on
well together. I don't want to come between."</p>

<p>"It's her own risk," Jermyn declared. "I can't think myself
how a marriage made like ours could ever be a successful one. I
know it can never be successful. Still, I shall do my best now,
I shall do my best always&mdash;up to a certain point."</p>

<p>She looked at him inquiringly. For a few moments he said
nothing, watching the people pass in and out of the place. Then
he turned once more to his companion.</p>

<p>"Sybil," he said; "Sybil, there will always be this in my
heart. Lucille is to be my wife and I shall give her exactly
what the law demands, but between you and me there is something
else. There is the love which must have in it always a spark of
divinity, because for both of us it is leavened with
self-sacrifice. That is how it will always be to me. Now we have
finished with serious subjects. You must decide for yourself
whether it shall be more muffins or some of those little cakes;
or we can talk over what we are going to give Mary for a
Christmas present; or shall we discuss exactly how you are going
to say those few lines at the end of the second act, which
Jameson and I can't agree about?"</p>

<p>She lifted her veil&mdash;there was no need to keep it down
any longer.</p>

<p>"One at a time, please," she laughed. "To begin with, then, I
want another muffin."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="first">In Bond Street the next morning Jermyn met Mr.
Norden Smith. Mr. Norden Smith was attired in the height of
fashion, with a large bunch of violets in his buttonhole. He
looked with some surprise at Jermyn's blue serge suit and bowler
hat. The two men shook hands and talked for a few minutes on
casual subjects.</p>

<p>"Say, there's one thing that licks me about this country,"
Mr. Norden Smith remarked, "and that is the different sorts of
advice every one gives you. I haven't been over on this side
very much, as you know&mdash;in fact this is really my first
trip that amounts to anything&mdash;and before I came they all
told me that whatever I did, when I showed myself in the
west-end of London I mustn't go about as we do in New York, but I
must wear a silk hat and proper morning clothes. Yet here I am,
doing as I was told, and there are you, a young Londoner who
ought to know all about it, as comfortable as possible in a blue
serge suit, a pot hat, a spotted blue tie and a colored
collar."</p>

<p>Jermyn laughed.</p>

<p>"You must remember," he pointed out, "that I am half a
Bohemian. I really have very little to do with the fashionable
world. You mustn't go by me, anyway. As a rule, I think we dress
according to the things we have to do. I have had to write for a
couple of hours this morning, then I am going to lunch alone at
my club, and in the afternoon I shall be at the theatre,
rehearsing a play. If I were going to pay calls upon friends, as
no doubt you are, why, I daresay I should have been wearing town
clothes, too. How long are you up for?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not altogether sure," Mr. Norden Smith replied.
"Anyway, when I've finished with London I shall be getting home
again before very long. I have had a very pleasant tour over
here and I have got through half of the business that brought
me, most satisfactorily. By the by," he added, "you don't happen
to know anything of a fellow-countryman of mine, A Mr.
Chalmers&mdash;Aaron Chalmers they call him? He is better known
over on this side, I think, than with us. He has spent the last
fifteen years of his life in Europe, with only an occasional
visit to New York. Chap not much older than you are, I should
say."</p>

<p>"I know him quite well," Jermyn admitted, "or rather, perhaps
I should say I know of him quite well. He has a large estate
down in Hertfordshire. He is a member, too, of the club at which
I am just going to lunch."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" Mr. Norden Smith exclaimed, with
interest. "Now I wonder whether you could put me in the way of
finding him?"</p>

<p>Jermyn glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"If he is in town at all," he said, "he will probably be at
the club. Come along and have luncheon with me. If he isn't
there, I can find out from some one where he is. He has a very
large circle of friends. He goes down to the Riviera every
season, I believe, but it's too early for him to have made a
move yet. Very good time, I should think, to catch him in
town."</p>

<p>"Well, that's really very kind of you," Mr. Norden Smith
declared. "If it's wholly agreeable to you, I should be
delighted. I have nothing to do with myself just at present. I
have bought a few books and curios; I have finished up my little
cathedral tour, and, as I said just now, I've got through half
the business that really brought me over. A week or two more and
I think that I shall make tracks for home."</p>

<p>"It's a quarter to one now," Jermyn remarked. "I have been
working all the morning and I am really out for a little
exercise. If you're in no particular hurry, we might walk to the
top of Bond Street and back again. I want to call at my
shirt-maker's, and I suppose I am Englishman enough to love walking in
this particular street."</p>

<p>"I am with you all the time," Mr. Norden Smith answered with
alacrity, as they strolled off. "It's a commonplace, poky-looking
little thoroughfare to any one that's been used to Fifth
Avenue, but I am not going to say that it hasn't points. The
women, for instance. Finest women in the world. Never saw
anything like them. Such complexions! Gee! Here's a lovely woman
coming now! What a carriage! What a figure!"</p>

<p>Jermyn smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"You ought to recognize her," he said. "That is the Duchesse
de Sayers, to whom, by the by, I am engaged to be married."</p>

<p>"Now that's interesting," Mr. Norden Smith declared. "But I
thought&mdash;I understood&mdash;I had an idea&mdash;"</p>

<p>They were face to face with Lucille now. She was dressed, as
usual, in perfect taste, a very distinguished and distinctive
figure. Some change seemed to have come over her during the last
few steps. The brilliant smile with which she had welcomed them
had passed from her face. She was looking steadily at Mr. Norden
Smith.</p>

<p>"Let me assure you," Jermyn said, as they paused, "that Mr.
Norden Smith isn't a nightmare. You look at him as though he
might have come from the land of shadows. Seriously, you
remember him, don't you, Lucille? Mr. Smith paid us one rather
unfortunately timed visit to Annerley."</p>

<p>Lucille had recovered herself to some extent, and held out
her fingers.</p>

<p>"Of course I remember Mr. Norden Smith," she assented. "Just
for the moment, when I saw him with you, Jermyn, I am afraid I
could only remember that he was associated in my mind with
something very terrible. It was such an unexpected meeting, you
see. I quite thought that you had gone back to the United
States."</p>

<p>"I shall always regret, Duchess," the American replied, "that
I shall have no opportunity to efface from your mind that
unfortunate impression. It was an ill-timed visit of mine,
beyond a doubt, but in its way, if I may be allowed to say so,
it was as great a shock for me as for any of you."</p>

<p>"You must give us an opportunity," Jermyn declared, "of
seeing something more of you next time you are over. We should
both be delighted."</p>

<p>"I am sure that's very kind of you," Mr. Norden Smith
answered. "In the meantime, I expect to be on this side a week
or so longer, at any rate, and it would give me a great deal of
pleasure if you and the Duchess would do me the honor of dining
with me at my hotel, the <i>Milan</i>, any evening to suit
yourselves."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," Lucille said. "I am afraid, for the
present, so far as I am concerned it would be quite impossible.
Jermyn knows how full of engagements I am at this time of the
year. Where are you going to now, Jermyn?"</p>

<p>"Up to my shirt-maker's," Jermyn replied. "Afterwards, we are
going to lunch at the club."</p>

<p>For some reason or other, Lucille seemed scarcely
pleased.</p>

<p>"I was just wondering," she remarked, "when I saw you coming,
whether I shouldn't be able to get an invitation to the
<i>Ritz</i>. I am not lunching anywhere to-day."</p>

<p>Jermyn shook his head.</p>

<p>"We want to see a friend of Norden Smith's," he
explained,&mdash;"Chalmers. You know Aaron Chalmers, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do," Lucille admitted. "Is he in town?"</p>

<p>"We aren't sure," Jermyn told her. "If he is, we shall
probably find him at the club. That is why I asked Mr. Norden
Smith to lunch with me."</p>

<p>"In that case," Lucille said slowly, "I must not interfere,
of course. We shall meet this evening, then, Jermyn."</p>

<p>She nodded to Mr. Norden Smith and passed on. Before she had
gone a yard, however, she turned and called after them.</p>

<p>"Jermyn!"</p>

<p>Jermyn stepped back. Mr. Norden Smith remained on the edge of
the pavement.</p>

<p>"What are you doing with that man?" she demanded quickly.
"Why on earth did you speak to him at all? A most impossible
person! Why should you take him to your club?"</p>

<p>"I do not find him an impossible person at all," Jermyn
replied calmly. "He happened to present himself at Annerley at a
very unfortunate time, but so far as he was concerned, he
behaved most considerately. I find no fault with him. My
invitation was only a matter of ordinary courtesy, such as I
think we ought to extend to traveling Americans when we have an
opportunity."</p>

<p>"It seems to me entirely unnecessary," she declared, in an
undertone. "I dislike Mr. Norden Smith extremely. He belongs to
that very ordinary type of person whom I am surprised that you
should encourage."</p>

<p>Jermyn smiled.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I must try and preserve myself from any
contamination, I suppose, but so far as the immediate present is
concerned, my luncheon invitation has been given and accepted. I
will, of course, be careful to make no arrangements for dining
with him. Nothing else I can do for you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," she answered, after a moment's hesitation. "If I
were you, I shouldn't treat that man with too much confidence. I
don't know what there is about him but he makes me shiver. Ah,
here comes that stupid Lady Chalcote; I suppose I shall have to
talk to her."</p>

<p>Jermyn rejoined his companion, who was waiting upon the
curb.</p>

<p>"Say, I must congratulate you, Sir Jermyn," Mr. Norden Smith
said heartily. "I am afraid I got sort of mixed up over this. I
had an idea when I was down in your county that you were engaged
to that charming little fair-haired lady, Miss Sybil
Cluley."</p>

<p>Jermyn made no reply for a moment. Glancing into his face,
Mr. Norden Smith suddenly realized that he had blundered. He
vigorously launched into another subject.</p>

<p>"My mistake, no doubt. People gossip so in those small
places. Now," he added, "I wonder if you could recommend me, Sir
Jermyn, to a really good shirt-maker. You know what happens to
us over in America if we buy dress shirts. I suppose it's our
own fault. We don't take the trouble about clothes that we
ought. You wouldn't care, I suppose, to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You shall come in with me now," Jermyn suggested. "I think
my people are as good as any. They will probably look after you
all right."</p>

<p>"You're exactly the man I was looking for," Mr. Norden Smith
declared.</p>

<p>They made some purchases together and reached Jermyn's club
at about twenty minutes past one. When they were about half-way
through a very excellent luncheon, Jermyn stopped a friend who
was passing their table.</p>

<p>"Sidney," he said, "you know every one. Tell me, where is
Chalmers?"</p>

<p>"Left for America this week," his friend replied, "on the
<i>Lusitania</i>, I think."</p>

<p>Mr. Norden Smith was a quiet man, of quiet manners and
impassive countenance. Nevertheless, he spilt a little wine from
the glass which he had been in the act of conveying to his lips.
He leaned forward across the table. His eyes seemed to have sunk
deeper into his head and his voice was scarcely pitched in its
natural key.</p>

<p>"Gone to America&mdash;Aaron Chalmers?"</p>

<p>"That's so," Jermyn's friend assented lightly. "He was in
here the other afternoon, I remember, when he received a cable.
He threw it into the fire and laughed. Nothing very serious, I
think. I imagined it was an invitation, or something of the
sort. Anyway, off he went. He'll be back next month. I suppose I
shall have to come and see you made into a respectable member of
Society, Jermyn, old fellow," he went on. "You gave us quite a
surprise."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad of your support," Jermyn answered.</p>

<p>His friend passed on. Mr. Norden Smith finished his luncheon
in more silent mood. Directly they had reached the hall, he held
out his hand.</p>

<p>"Sir Jermyn," he began, "I am exceedingly indebted to you for
your hospitality. There is nothing I can do in return except to
assure you that whenever you find yourself on my side of the
water, well, I am your debtor. But there is just one thing I
should like to remark. I don't want to allude to a painful
subject at unnecessary length and I haven't spoken about it to-day
because I guess you must be pretty well sick of it, but that
was a terrible affair that happened down at your place when I
was there a terrible affair."</p>

<p>Jermyn sighed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Smith," he said, "you are right. I don't think we shall
any of us get over the shock for some time."</p>

<p>"I wanted just to say this," Mr. Smith continued,
emphatically. "I don't suppose it's likely that anything
disagreeable to you could ever arise from it, but if things
turned out that way, if things got somehow so that you needed
help or advice, why, I want you to remember that I am a criminal
lawyer of some repute on the other side, that I was on the spot,
and that if I were forced to collect them, I've a few ideas of
my own upon that night's work. Will you just send me a cable,
Sir Jermyn, if anything goes wrong? Norden Smith, Manhattan
Club, New York&mdash;that's all you'll need."</p>

<p>"I most certainly will," Jermyn promised him. "I tell you
what I'd very much prefer, though, and that is that you came
into the smoking-room with me now, and over that cigar and some
very excellent brandy which I could find for you, told me just
what those ideas of yours were."</p>

<p>Mr. Norden Smith shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "that wouldn't quite fit in. I'd rather not
butt in on this affair at all, if I can help it. You see," he
went on slowly, "justice, as the law of your country understands
it, and the real Justice holding the scales between two human
beings, isn't always quite the same thing. I guess I'll have
nothing to say, unless, as I suggested just now, matters don't
go altogether right. Here's to you, Sir Jermyn, and the best of
luck!"</p>

<p>Jermyn walked with his guest to the steps and stood there
while he departed. Mr. Norden Smith made no further suggestion
with reference to the proposed dinner-party. He stepped into a
taxicab.</p>

<p>"The Cunard Steamship Company in Cockspur Street," he told
the man. "Say, get along as quick as you can. I want to get
there."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="first">Jermyn found an unexpected visitor awaiting him
when he returned to his rooms a little later on that afternoon.
A young man in deep mourning rose from the depths of his
easy-chair. For a moment Jermyn was puzzled.</p>

<p>"Come, have I grown as much as that?" the visitor laughed. "I
am Gerald Lakenham, you know."</p>

<p>"Why, of course," Jermyn replied. "I ought to have known you
anywhere. You aren't a bit like poor Aynesworth, though. I
thought you were on your way round the world."</p>

<p>"So I was," the young man answered. "I got this news at Rio
and I came straight along back."</p>

<p>Jermyn nodded sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Of course. Must have been rather a knock for you."</p>

<p>"It was indeed," the young man admitted. "I can scarcely
realize it, even now. Poor old Aynesworth! He wasn't half such a
bad fellow, you know."</p>

<p>Jermyn was silent. There was no person in the world whom he
wished less to discuss.</p>

<p>"I came along to see you," the new Marquis of Lakenham
continued, "because I can't help feeling that it's all rather
rot about old Aynesworth getting it in the neck like that and no
one punished for it. Looks sort of slack, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"I understand that the police have been making every effort,"
Jermyn remarked.</p>

<p>"Then I should say it was jolly well time they were helped,"
the young man declared. "It doesn't seem as though there could
be a simpler case. Everybody and everything was there ready to
their hands. I have just come from Scotland Yard at this moment,
and if you ask me, I don't believe they have the slightest idea
in their heads as to who did this thing."</p>

<p>"I don't think that any one has," Jermyn replied.</p>

<p>"I am not quite so sure of that," Gerald Lakenham dissented.
"At any rate, it makes one feel rather fed up with the English
detective system. I have made up my mind, anyhow, to see what I
can do towards clearing the affair up. Aynesworth was my
brother, after all, and as head of the house now I suppose it's
up to me to do something."</p>

<p>"What steps do you propose to take?" Jermyn inquired.</p>

<p>"I have engaged an awfully clever private detective," the
young man went on. "I want you, if you will, to be so good as to
give him a clear run down at Annerley, and to let him interview
you about the affair before he goes down."</p>

<p>Jermyn was silent for some little time.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you have actually engaged this
fellow?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I have engaged him all right," Gerald Lakenham answered.
"He's guaranteed me an arrest within thirty days, and it seems
to me that he knows his business."</p>

<p>"Did you consult any one before you took this step?"</p>

<p>"Not a soul. There isn't any one really, you see, except you.
In fact, you're the first person I've talked it over with. Of
course, the mater doesn't count. Women don't understand a matter
of this sort."</p>

<p>"I have no confidence," Jermyn said quietly, "in private
detectives."</p>

<p>"This fellow Grayson is awfully clever," his visitor assured
him. "It was he who found out all about the Midland Bank
robberies, and he has a little memorandum of all the best known
thieves in Europe, compiled by himself. The police make use of
him often, although, of course, they always take the credit.
Jolly interesting fellow, too, to talk to."</p>

<p>"No doubt," Jermyn admitted, "and yet, I am afraid I shall
have to say that I disapprove altogether of his employment in
this case. I think the Scotland Yard people are doing everything
that can be done, and any outside interference is only likely to
make the matter more difficult for them."</p>

<p>"Up to the present," Gerald Lakenham remarked dryly,
"everything that can be done means that nothing has been done at
all. You know, I don't pretend to be overburdened with
sentiment, and that sort of thing, but Aynesworth was my
brother, and head of the family, and I don't feel like sitting
still and leaving the mystery of his death unsolved."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," Jermyn replied thoughtfully, "if he were alive
that is precisely what he would wish us to do."</p>

<p>The young man was impressed.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he said, "if you really believe that?"</p>

<p>"On the whole," Jermyn assured him, "I do. Aynesworth could
have made a statement, if he had chosen to, before he died. He
had several minutes of complete consciousness."</p>

<p>Gerald sat for a few moments with a frown upon his forehead.
This was distinctly a disconcerting point of view and one which
had not previously occurred to him.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea," he asked slowly, "whether there is any
truth in the rumor that Sybil Cluley and Aynesworth had met
before that time at your house?"</p>

<p>"No truth at all," Jermyn answered, decidedly. "Miss Cluley
is a very charming and delightful young lady and she has nothing
whatever to do with this terrible business. If the detective of
whom you speak is going to cause her the least annoyance, I tell
you frankly, Gerald, that I shall take steps to protect
her."</p>

<p>"The fellow only wants to find out the truth," Gerald
protested. "I don't suppose Miss Cluley objects to that. It's as
much in her interests as any one's."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose any one whom we are likely to be interested
in would not be immensely relieved," Jermyn said, "if only the
truth could be discovered. At the same time, these fellows often
do a lot of mischief going into matters which don't concern the
case at all. I must admit that I have a strong prejudice against
them. The Scotland Yard people may do their work slowly, but as
a rule, if there's anything to be found out, they discover it in
time."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you don't approve," Gerald remarked, helping
himself to one of the cigarettes which Jermyn had produced, "but
I've turned Grayson loose on the job now, so I suppose he'll
have to get along a bit. Shall you mind his asking you a few
questions?"</p>

<p>"It depends very much upon what those questions are," Jermyn
replied. "As I said before, I am not favorably disposed towards
his class, nor am I in favor of his being employed in the
present case."</p>

<p>"Well, he's outside in my car," Gerald said. "Perhaps you'd
let him come in now and you can look him over. I want you, if
you will, too, to give him a letter of introduction to Miss
Cluley."</p>

<p>"I'll see him myself," Jermyn agreed. "I tell you frankly,
Gerald, though, that I can't promise I'll do anything to help
him interview Miss Cluley. She was my guest at the time that
wretched affair happened; it was my fault entirely that she was
brought into it, and she has already been bothered quite enough
about it."</p>

<p>"I'll fetch the fellow in, anyway," Gerald decided. "You'll
perhaps think more of him if you talk to him for a bit."</p>

<p>Grayson turned out to be a very inoffensive-looking person,
scarcely older than Jermyn himself. He was quietly dressed, and
his face was quite unnoticeable except for the occasional
brilliancy of his deep-set gray eyes. He looked like a man of
the middle classes&mdash;a traveler, perhaps, for a jewelry
firm&mdash;neatly dressed, stolid, not in the least
self-assertive, yet with sufficient self-assurance. Jermyn received
him a little curtly and motioned him to a chair.</p>

<p>"Lord Lakenham has been telling me that he has engaged you to
make some inquiries with reference to the murder of the late
Marquis," Jermyn said. "I should like you to understand at once
that I am strongly averse to the step which he has taken."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear that, sir," Grayson declared, "very sorry
indeed. Might I ask if the reasons are in any way personal?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," Jermyn admitted. "I never heard of you before.
I simply have a prejudice against your profession. I believe in
these cases being dealt with by the recognized authorities, and
I think that if they are left to themselves they are generally
successful."</p>

<p>"They don't seem to have got very far with the present
matter, sir."</p>

<p>"They have a way of taking their time," Jermyn asserted. "I
think they are quite right. To arrest a man prematurely is the
worst mistake that can be made. I have heard of cases in which
they watch the person whom they have known perfectly well to be
guilty of a crime, for months before they have arrested him,
waiting for the last link of evidence. I have heard, too, of
amateurs who rush in, put people upon their guard, and generally
make a hash of things."</p>

<p>"There is a great deal of sound common sense in your point of
view, Sir Jermyn," Grayson admitted. "I am aware that my
profession is an unpopular one and that there are many people
who consider that we should be abolished. If Lord Lakenham is
inclined to take your advice, I shall not stand in the way for a
moment. I shall only require the small sum I have spent for
out-pockets, and I will willingly drop the matter."</p>

<p>Gerald shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I don't think that I am quite inclined to consent to that,"
he decided. "What Sir Jermyn says may be all right, but I can
call to mind several cases lately of serious crimes where no
arrest whatever has been made. So long as you go carefully, I
don't see the least reason why you shouldn't have a try at
this."</p>

<p>"I take it, then," Grayson inquired, "that your lordship is
not at present disposed to rescind your instructions to me?"</p>

<p>"I am not," Gerald declared.</p>

<p>"In that case," Grayson proceeded briskly, "as I am here,
will Sir Jermyn mind answering a few questions?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that I have any particular objection," Jermyn
replied slowly, "at any rate so far as they concern myself and
my own doings."</p>

<p>"There are so few people who could have committed this
crime," Grayson said, "that one is rather inclined to take the
possible persons, one by one, and analyze their relations with
the deceased. I have acted to some small extent upon this."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" Jermyn remarked, dryly.</p>

<p>"I have carefully considered, for instance," Grayson told
him, "your own relations with the late Marquis of Lakenham, and
I have come to the conclusion, Sir Jermyn, that there was not,
nor could there have been at any time, anything connected with
them which might have caused bad blood between you two. I have
put you, therefore, outside the case."</p>

<p>"You relieve me immensely," Jermyn assured him,
satirically.</p>

<p>"I am not able," Grayson continued, unmoved, "to dismiss Miss
Sybil Cluley from the case with the same facility."</p>

<p>Jermyn was suddenly quiet. The fingers of his right hand
trembled a little and there was a dangerous light in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"In the course of my investigations," Grayson went on, "I
have discovered that the late Marquis of Lakenham and Miss Sybil
Cluley, who met at your house as strangers, were in reality
nothing of the sort."</p>

<p>"What the devil do you mean?" Jermyn demanded.</p>

<p>"Precisely what I say, sir," Grayson answered firmly. "Miss
Sybil Cluley six years ago was acting in a stock company at
Blackpool under the name of Miss May Marvis. The late Marquis
was in Blackpool at the time, was friendly with the manager of
that company, and was, without the shadow of a doubt, not only
acquainted with but an admirer of Miss Cluley."</p>

<p>"Most interesting!" Jermyn murmured, in a voice dangerously
low. "And from that you deduce?"</p>

<p>"At present I have deduced nothing," Grayson replied calmly.
"At the same time, no one seems to have stumbled upon this fact
before, and to my mind it throws an altogether new light upon
the situation. Miss Cluley, at the time she knew the Marquis,
was in exceedingly poor circumstances. The company with which
she was connected came to grief at Blackpool, and she was left
with the charge of her invalid sister. There is not the
slightest doubt that his lordship at that time was an ardent
admirer of Miss Cluley. Those are simple, incontrovertible
facts. This unexpected meeting under your roof, Sir Jermyn,
might well have proved embarrassing for the young lady."</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," Jermyn declared, "it was nothing of
the sort. This I can answer for, for I was in Miss Cluley's
confidence. The acquaintance at Blackpool of which you have
spoken, is a matter of common knowledge to those who were there
at the time, but let me tell you this, Mr. Grayson&mdash;Miss
Cluley and her sister left Blackpool when the company was broken
up, and never from that moment had she seen anything of Lord
Lakenham until they met under my roof. I make a statement there
which I defy you to disprove."</p>

<p>The detective listened and inclined his head slightly.</p>

<p>"My investigations as to what followed after Blackpool have
yet to be made, Sir Jermyn," he said.</p>

<p>"You spoke of some questions," Jermyn reminded him.</p>

<p>"I have some questions, a few, which I should like to ask,"
Grayson confessed. "I should like to ask you, for instance, what
were your general impressions as to the nature of the terms
existing between Miss Cluley and the deceased?"</p>

<p>"They met as fellow guests under my roof," Jermyn replied,
"and without any recognition of that previous acquaintance,
which, I may tell you, was a great deal slighter than you have
hinted. Miss Cluley recalled it and mentioned it to me. Lord
Lakenham never went further than to say that he believed they
had met before. They were perfectly civil to one another and
that was all. I don't suppose that they exchanged a hundred
words all the time, nor half a dozen sentences alone, up to the
night of the accident. We were a small party and we were
generally all together, except when Miss Cluley and I were
engaged reading the play which I have been preparing for
her."</p>

<p>"Is it a fact," Grayson continued, "that Miss Sybil Cluley
endeavored to obtain admission to the Marquis' chamber on the
night of his death?"</p>

<p>"It is very possible that she went there to inquire," Jermyn
answered. "We all did at various times during the night. There
was no sleep for any one."</p>

<p>"Miss Sybil Cluley states that she left the Marquis, of
Lakenham alone in the billiard-room because of a headache,"
Grayson went on. "Had she complained to any one of feeling
unwell?"</p>

<p>"Several times, and to several people," Jermyn assured him.
"The reason she refused to play bridge and started that
unfortunate game of billiards at all, was because she did not
feel equal to anything which made any demands upon her."</p>

<p>Grayson was looking out of the window steadily. At this
juncture he slowly turned his head and looked Jermyn full in the
face.</p>

<p>"Is it true, Sir Jermyn," he asked, "that you announced your
engagement to Miss Sybil Cluley at Annerley Court on the day
before the murder, that subsequently the announcement was
retracted, and that you are now about to be married to another
lady?"</p>

<p>"You make free with my concerns," Jermyn replied, his voice
trembling with anger. "What you say has some truth in it, but
the engagement between Miss Cluley and myself was never
confirmed. She is too devoted to the stage to care about
marriage."</p>

<p>Grayson folded up his notebook and returned it to his
pocket.</p>

<p>"I am afraid, Sir Jermyn," he said, "that your prejudice in
favor of this young lady prevents your considering the case
against her from an impartial point of view."</p>

<p>"If I have any prejudice in favor of her at all," Jermyn
retorted, "it is because I know her to be incapable of hurting
any one or anything. Her feelings toward Lord Lakenham were
simply feelings of good-tempered indifference. She started that
game of billiards on the distinct understanding that she might
leave off if she felt unwell."</p>

<p>"The weapon, I believe," Grayson inquired, "has never been
found?"</p>

<p>"Never to my knowledge."</p>

<p>"Might I ask whether a visit from me would be permitted at
Annerley Court?"</p>

<p>"It would not," Jermyn declared. "I am perfectly satisfied
with the present conduct of the case, and I resent your
interference in it."</p>

<p>Grayson rose.</p>

<p>"In that case, sir," he said, "you will permit me to
retire."</p>

<p>"One moment, Grayson," Gerald called after him. "I am coming
along."</p>

<p>"I will await you in the car, sir," Grayson answered.</p>

<p>The detective turned stolidly towards the door and made his
way downstairs.</p>

<p>"You don't like the fellow," Gerald remarked.</p>

<p>Jermyn shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I haven't any real feelings about him, only I can't help
thinking that his interference in this matter is unnecessary and
annoying. His remarks about Miss Cluley, too, I look upon as
sheer impertinence."</p>

<p>Gerald nodded and himself prepared to depart.</p>

<p>"That's all very well, Jermyn," he objected. "You think a
great deal of Miss Cluley, evidently, and I daresay she's a
jolly nice girl, but every word of what Grayson has said is, to
my mind, sound common sense. Come, I challenge you, now. Tell me
why you were engaged to Miss Cluley the day before the murder,
and now you are going to marry the Duchesse de Sayers?"</p>

<p>"The matter is entirely a private one," Jermyn replied. "You
know very well that Lucille and I have been the greatest friends
all our lives. Our marriage has been spoken of more than
once."</p>

<p>"I wonder if you are shielding that girl, Jermyn?" Gerald
asked suddenly.</p>

<p>Jermyn never flinched.</p>

<p>"You don't know Miss Cluley, Gerald, or you wouldn't ask such
a question."</p>

<p>Gerald smiled as he turned away.</p>

<p>"I must confess," he declared, with a little sigh, "that
there have been times when I have wished that I did, and not
very long ago. She does look the most delightful person on the
stage, and quite, as you say, as though she wouldn't hurt a
fly...Well, so long, old fellow. I can see that you are not on
our side. We must do the best we can without you."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p class="first">Ten minutes after his visitor had departed,
Jermyn was ringing the bell at the door of Lucille's house in
Grosvenor Street. There was a brief colloquy between the butler
and a French maid, and after a very short delay Jermyn was taken
upstairs into a little boudoir. Madame la Duchesse, the maid
announced, was in the hands of the dressmaker, but monsieur
should be kept waiting only a very few minutes. Almost as she
departed, Lucille swept into the room from her adjoining
bedchamber, dressed in a wonderful creation of green velvet and
lace.</p>

<p>"You are just in time, my dear Jermyn," she declared. "How
glad I am to see you! Madame Lucie has brought some of my
dresses round herself, and we cannot decide about the length of
this jacket. You are a man and therefore you know nothing about
it; therefore, you ought to be able to judge precisely what is
correct. Shall it be just as it is or two inches longer?"</p>

<p>"Two inches longer," Jermyn replied, without hesitation.
"And, Lucille, I want just a word with you, at once."</p>

<p>She closed the communicating door.</p>

<p>"Well, I am here," she pointed out. "I can assure you that
you are the only person whom I should receive under such
conditions."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything of a man named Grayson? Has he been to
see you?"</p>

<p>Lucille assented.</p>

<p>"He called a few minutes ago with a note from Gerald. I was
going to tell you about it this evening."</p>

<p>"And you?" he asked swiftly.</p>

<p>"I declined to receive him. Isn't that what you would have
wished?"</p>

<p>"Entirely," Jermyn replied, in a tone of relief, "You did not
see him at all, then?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. I have made a bargain and I mean to keep to
it, in the spirit as well as the letter. I have no information
to give him."</p>

<p>"Gerald has come back full of this matter," Jermyn went on,
"and he's got it into his head that Scotland Yard are apathetic
about it. He's gone to this man Grayson and the fellow actually
admits openly that he suspects Sybil. He dared to ask me
questions. He showed me quite clearly the line his
investigations were going to take."</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she said calmly, "I am the only person who can
bring this thing home to Sybil Cluley. My word is passed to you
and Sybil Cluley is safe. I suppose, in your ungallant way," she
added, making a little grimace at him, "you would say that you
were paying the price."</p>

<p>"I am paying the price!" he declared, passionately. "You know
that I am! I love Sybil Cluley. Every day my feeling for her
grows stronger. It is indeed a price that I am paying and that
is what sometimes makes my blood run cold. If it should be in
vain!"</p>

<p>"There is no fear of that," Lucille assured him. "This man
may suspect, as any one who knew a few ordinary facts which I
presume he has collected, certainly would suspect. What do his
suspicions amount to? Nothing at all. There are hundreds of
people who Scotland Yard know perfectly well are guilty of
various crimes, but they'll go free all their days for want of a
little evidence. The only evidence against Sybil Cluley is in my
possession, and you have bought my silence. I will admit at
once, if you like, that I could hang her. I could! It is easily
within my power. Yet you need not have a moment's fear. She will
be as free in twenty years' time as she is today."</p>

<p>Jermyn was walking restlessly up and down the little room.
Its very luxury, its voluptuous air of femininity, seemed
somehow to offend him. He felt the toils coming nearer!</p>

<p>"Sometimes," he said, "I think that we have made a huge
mistake, all of us. For if Sybil really did this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>If</i> Sybil really did this!" Lucille interrupted,
mockingly.</p>

<p>"Leave the 'if' out, then," Jermyn continued. "Let us say
that Sybil did it. She was driven to it, she was mad, the brute
provoked her. I respect her for it. I know the story of their
former acquaintance. I know the sort of man Aynesworth was. I
can guess what passed between them in the billiard-room. In a
moment of anger she may have fired that shot. I don't believe
that any jury in England who knew the facts of the case would
treat her severely."</p>

<p>Lucille laughed contemptuously.</p>

<p>"My dear Jermyn," she said, "we are not in France or in
America. There are no unwritten laws here. The man or woman who
takes life pays for it according to the old biblical law. Our
juries are not swayed by sentiment and hysterics, nor our judges
by a pretty woman's tears. Sybil Cluley did well to conceal her
guilt, and you have done well to buy her immunity. Only,
Jermyn," she added, coming a little closer to him, "I do wish
that you didn't think the price was such a terrible one. Do you
believe that there are many men who would feel as you do?"</p>

<p>He stood and looked at her. She took his hand.</p>

<p>"I don't count them," she went on, with a little smile at the
corners of her lips, "but I must have had at least twenty offers
of marriage within the last few months. Do you know, I wonder,
that I am very rich, that my name is a famous one, that I am
supposed to be beautiful, supposed to wear my clothes well, to
have a personality? I could have been a duchess again in France,
a princess in Germany, a marchioness here, or the wife of one of
your greatest Ministers. Yet here I am, almost a suppliant at
your hands. You aren't so rich as those other men, Jermyn; you
aren't even as good-looking as some of them. You are clever in
your way but you are very narrow; you are full of prejudices;
you are only half educated. Yet I want you, and I want you to
care. Some day you will, but I hate to think of the time, even
though it be only months, before you will care."</p>

<p>"What if it were a lifetime?" he asked. "What if I were never
to care at all? Narrow, you call me; half educated; full of
prejudices. Perhaps I am, according to the modern standard, but
there are things that go with that. We Annerleys are a faithful
lot to our womankind, and for all your disdain of her, I have
never met any woman in the world but Sybil Cluley who counts to
me."</p>

<p>Lucille half closed her eyes. Her head was thrown proudly
back. One saw that she was suffering.</p>

<p>"A moon-faced chit," she muttered, "paid to play antics upon
the stage for the amusement of her betters! Jermyn, I can
understand the weak-kneed, hobbledehoy sons of our decent people
going and throwing themselves away upon these stage puppets, but
when a man like you, with brains, who should know what women
really are, what race counts for, what it means to posterity,
goes moonstruck about a little actress and wants to marry her,
you make me feel inclined to wonder, after all, whether I
shouldn't do the kindest thing if I turned you out of my house
and rang up Scotland Yard on that telephone...No, I won't go
on," she added. "I don't mean this, of course, but don't talk to
me of Sybil Cluley, if you can help it. Presently I hope you
will understand my point of view. And now, if you don't mind,
you must run away, please. We shall meet later on. Where is it
we are dining? I forget for the moment but I suppose we both
have it down."</p>

<p>"At the Rochesters'," Jermyn reminded her.</p>

<p>"Of course! Dear old-fashioned people, Florence's father and
mother, who will see that you take me in to dinner, and put us
side by side, and nod and smile all the time as though an
engagement were some sort of peculiarly humorous situation
devised for their entertainment. Well, Jermyn, if you have
nothing more to say to me about this, we can have a chat about
other things then. But so far as my side of the bargain is
concerned, you needn't be afraid. I shall keep it. Sybil Cluley
is safe and will remain safe, if my silence has anything to do
with it. She would be safe if my intervention could save
her."</p>

<p>Jermyn went restlessly out into the street. Lucille was
right. He had been a fool to suspect her. He made his way to the
theatre on the chance of seeing Sybil there, although it was not
a regular rehearsal afternoon. He found her going through a
portion of the last act with her leading man. She appealed to
him at once about a rendering of her part, and he sat in the
stalls of the gloomy, unlit auditorium, listening, striving to
keep his mind upon the disputed psychological question of her
attitude towards the man whom, notwithstanding his
faithlessness, she loved. When he had given his decision, he
returned to the stage.</p>

<p>"I shall just have time," he said, "to drive you home."</p>

<p>"You are getting me into frightfully extravagant habits," she
declared. "Whatever shall I do, I wonder, when I have to look
after myself all the time?"</p>

<p>He was silent. He had not yet arrived at the stage in their
relations when he could listen to such speeches unmoved. They
stepped out into the street and he sent a boy for a taxicab. At
that moment Grayson went strolling by. Jermyn excused himself
with a muttered word and crossed the road. He accosted Grayson
with little ceremony.</p>

<p>"Look here," he began, "you remember me?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, Sir Jermyn," Grayson replied.</p>

<p>Jermyn held him by the arm; the man was powerless to
move.</p>

<p>"Listen," he continued fiercely, "you can pursue your dirty
work when and how you like, but if you make yourself in any way
obnoxious to the young lady whom I presume you are here to
watch, I shall take you by the scruff of the neck, law or no
law, and thrash you till you howl for mercy. I don't know what
the devil men like you are allowed to go about for, poking your
noses into other people's business, raking up the ashes of dead
miseries. The law can look after her own children and her own
sinners. You vermin, trying to bring about a man or a woman's
ruin for the sake of your fees, ought to be stamped out of
existence. You understand me? I am in earnest."</p>

<p>"I can feel that you are in earnest, Sir Jermyn," Grayson
remarked, holding his arm. "I will not argue with you. I can
reply only that I have accepted a certain commission from the
Marquis of Lakenham, and so far as I am able I shall do my duty,
regardless of whom it may affect."</p>

<p>"Then you are warned," Jermyn exclaimed fiercely, "for if it
be in the middle of Pall Mall, with a dozen policemen within
call, the first time I come across you I'll beat you till you
can't breathe, if I find you making yourself objectionable to
that lady over there. So now you know. Earn your money if you
can, but remember!"</p>

<p>Jermyn recrossed the street. The taxicab was standing by the
curb. He handed Sybil in and seated himself by her side,
white-hot with anger.</p>

<p>"My dear Jermyn!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Sybil, I am a fool," he admitted. "I can't help it. That ass
of a young Lakenham is employing a private
detective&mdash;that's the whole truth."</p>

<p>She was suddenly frightened.</p>

<p>"You don't think that he'll find out anything, do you?" she
asked, catching at his hand.</p>

<p>He drew her fingers firmly into his.</p>

<p>"My dear," he declared, "there isn't the slightest fear.
There is not, nor ever will be, any evidence forthcoming
sufficient to justify the arrest of any living person for
killing Lakenham. That I know to be a fact. It's the annoyance
of the thing which I feel&mdash;nothing else. I hate that slimy
sort of person, wandering about with his nose to the ground,
planning the destruction of a human being...You see," he went
on, in a moment or two, "I've got over the horror of it all. I
always was a little of a philosopher, you know, and if ever
there was a man who deserved to die, it was Lakenham. I am
sorry, but he's dead, and he's met the fate he's gone about the
world asking for, for years. That's how I look at it. It may
seem callous. You may not agree with me. You may feel a little
more sentiment about it. But he's dead and there's an end of it.
That's my attitude."</p>

<p>She sat by his side, quite silent.</p>

<p>"I am sorry about this detective," she said, "but you are
right, of course. It isn't of any serious moment. I shan't
worry. If he comes to me and asks questions, well, you can guess
what will happen. Presently it will all simmer down, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"I'm sick of the newspapers and the way they've piled it on
about this affair," Jermyn continued. "Just at present I'm
feeling sublimely egotistical. To me the tragedy of Aynesworth's
death is nothing like the tragedy of my taking another woman to
be my wife. As the days grow nearer, the thing rises up before
me like a great threatening shadow. I can't look beyond a
fortnight to-morrow. I can't realize any future for myself as
the husband of Lucille."</p>

<p>She shivered slightly, but she kept her voice steady.</p>

<p>"And yet, dear," she reminded him, "not so very long ago you
used to say that a man's real life was outside the ties of his
womankind."</p>

<p>"Thank you for reminding me of it," he cried swiftly. "There
alone is where my hope lies. There are plenty of others,
especially in our world, married, who see just about as much of
their wives as they do of their chefs. Very well. Life is still
full of the big things. There's the work. I have an idea for a
long voyage&mdash;China, perhaps. Egypt isn't altogether played
out for any one with a trick of writing. This is all in the
future, of course. And there's your next play. I am your
dramatist for life, mind, even when you have your own theatre,
even though you should have an actor-manager for a husband."</p>

<p>She turned away.</p>

<p>"I don't think, dear," she said, "that I shall marry.
However, one can never tell. Here we are, you see. I am not
going to ask you in to-night. I have to go to a woman's dinner
at the Lyceum Club and I want to make a few notes. Fancy saying
things about the stage! Doesn't it seem absurd? I ought to have
asked you to have written out my speech for me. And don't worry
about that man. I don't think that, starting as late as he has
done, he is likely to find out much that Scotland Yard hasn't
found out long ago."</p>

<p>Jermyn returned to his rooms, somehow or other a little
light-hearted. He got through his dinner-party better than he
had expected and he left Lucille upon her doorstep with blank
disregard of her little unspoken invitation. Then he called in
at the club and strolled into the smoking-room. He was still on
the threshold of the room, however, when he heard a fragment of
conversation from the depths of two easy-chairs, which brought
him to a standstill.</p>

<p>"Seen the papers to-night, Roland? The <i>Star</i> says that
an arrest will be made in the Lakenham murder case within the
next twenty-four hours. Some new information has come into the
hands of the police."</p>

<p>"About time, too," another voice grumbled. "The police never
had a simpler case put into their hands. I could have solved
that little mystery for them."</p>

<p>Jermyn came forward into the room. One of the two speakers
quickly ordered a whisky-and-soda; the other plunged into his
evening paper. Jermyn, however, nodded amiably at both of
them.</p>

<p>"No need to shut up because I came along, old chap," he said
to one of the men, whom he knew well. "I only hope that what you
say is true. Personally, I don't believe it. I am afraid,
somehow, that the moment has gone by. I don't believe that the
person who murdered poor Aynesworth will ever be discovered
now."</p>

<p>It was the first time Jermyn had joined in any of the little
discussions concerning the affair. His friend, the Honorable
Holland Rorke, who was to be his best man, silently handed him
up the paper. There was a little paragraph of only three
lines:</p><br>

<p class="newspaper"> "At the moment of going to press, we have
received information of a confidential nature, to the effect
that an arrest will be made in the Lakenham murder case within
the next twenty-four hours." </p> <br>

<p>Jermyn shook his head as he handed back the paper. "I only
wish I could believe it," he declared.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p class="first">Notwithstanding that momentous announcement,
the twenty-four hours passed without an arrest. Other days
followed. There was a period of dramatic inaction. The little
paragraph in the paper was followed by others. People whispered
at the clubs about a great surprise. Still nothing happened.
Then Gerald called upon Jermyn at his rooms one evening. Jermyn
was making a few last arrangements. His trunks, all packed,
stood in the hall. On the following afternoon he was to be
married, and after the reception he and Lucille were to leave
for Rome.</p>

<p>Gerald came in a little hesitatingly but Jermyn was glad
enough to see him.</p>

<p>"Pretty near the end of your bachelor career at last, then,
Jermyn," the young man remarked, stretching himself out in an
easy-chair. "You've kept out of it pretty well, too. Thirty-two
next birthday, I see you are. Can't think how you've managed it.
I'm twenty-four and I very nearly came to grief last night at
the Manninghams'. I'm too susceptible, you know, Jermyn. I wish
I could take something to keep me off the books till I
was&mdash;say, thirty."</p>

<p>"Try travel," Jermyn suggested.</p>

<p>"It's too jolly interesting at home," Gerald objected. "I am
dead nuts on shooting, as you know, and then the
hunting&mdash;November at Melton&mdash;gorgeous! I have never
owned more than a couple of gees in my life, remember. Then
there's the lease of that salmon river runs for another three
years yet. I've never caught any really big fish, and old
Manningham was telling me yesterday that he never had such sport
in his life as he had up there with poor old Aynesworth, last
spring."</p>

<p>Jermyn smiled.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "even if you should have the misfortune to
be lured into an early matrimonial pitfall, sport remains,
doesn't it? There will be still your shooting and your hunting
and your fishing."</p>

<p>The young man nodded.</p>

<p>"That's true enough," he agreed. "That's one consolation,
anyway. You know, Jermyn," he went on, "I can't come to your
wedding to-morrow, can I?"</p>

<p>"Of course you can't," Jermyn replied. "I quite understand
that."</p>

<p>"I shall look in at the reception just to say goodbye,"
Gerald continued, "but it's only just inside two months.
Aynesworth was only a sort of second cousin of yours, you see,
whereas he was my own brother."</p>

<p>"You are quite right," Jermyn assured him. "Our own wedding
would have been postponed longer still but for certain
circumstances. As it is, it is going to be very quiet. No
function of any sort."</p>

<p>"I thought I'd like to look you up for a minute or two,"
Gerald said, "before you went. I saw Grayson this morning. He
told me that he had reached a point in his investigations when
he was absolutely convinced in his own mind that he could put
his finger upon the guilty party. He waits only for one slight
piece of evidence."</p>

<p>"Did he mention the name," Jermyn asked, "of the guilty
party?"</p>

<p>"He did," Jermyn admitted.</p>

<p>"Am I to know?"</p>

<p>"Grayson was very anxious that I shouldn't tell you," Gerald
replied. "Seems afraid of you for some reason or another. I
don't believe in that sort of thing myself. Blood is thicker
than water, and a fellow like that doesn't, of course,
understand how we feel. I am sure that you only want the truth
to prevail, and all that. Grayson is practically convinced that
Aynesworth was shot by Miss Sybil Cluley."</p>

<p>Jermyn was so prepared that he was not even agitated.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said, a little wearily, "there isn't a man in
London who has read the case who hasn't at some time or another
suggested that either I or Miss Sybil Cluley committed the
murder. You see, as a matter of fact we didn't, Gerald. That is
why this wonderful discovery of Mr. Grayson's leaves me cold.
That is why I hated to have you employ him. These fellows are
never really any good. They simply walk along the obvious path
and choose the most obvious person as a butt for their
suspicions. Miss Sybil Cluley never fired off a pistol in her
life. She doesn't know how. Besides that, remember, she had no
quarrel with Aynesworth."</p>

<p>"There was that little bit of her past in which Aynesworth
seems to have become mixed up," Gerald reminded him.</p>

<p>"Absolutely innocent; absolutely unimportant," Jermyn
declared warmly. "I know it off by heart. I knew it all the
time. There was no harm that Aynesworth could do Sybil. He was,
as a matter of fact, her warm admirer, and paid her continual
attentions that night at dinner-time. They were excellent
friends when we left them, and it was quite impossible that any
cause of disagreement of so serious a nature could have sprung
up during those few minutes."</p>

<p>Gerald nodded.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "that sounds all right. Personally, I know
nothing of Miss Sybil Cluley except that she's a thundering
good-looking girl, and I'd much rather think that it was any one
else."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd take the affair out of the fellow's hands,"
Jermyn begged. "You know, I'm leaving England for some time,
to-morrow, and I must confess that it sits like a black cloud over
me to think that at any moment I may hear that a young lady for
whom I have the sincerest admiration and esteem, who was my
guest at the time this thing happened, and who, but for certain
circumstances, would have been my wife, is in danger of being
annoyed by these absurd charges. I feel my responsibility as
host. If it had not been for my very pressing invitation, Miss
Cluley would never have come to Annerley."</p>

<p>"I can't take it out of his hands now," Gerald regretted.
"The fellow's worked like a brick and I have given him my
promise. He's frightfully keen over the matter and he's got
something up his sleeve that he hasn't even told me. He has
collected all his evidence in a perfectly justifiable and decent
sort of way. He hasn't bothered Miss Cluley at all
in&mdash;fact, he hasn't really mentioned her name to me. I only
put two and two together myself when I told you that she is,
without a doubt, the person whom he is going for."</p>

<p>Jermyn sat quite still for some time, looking into the
fire.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you're a bit hit over all this, old chap,"
Gerald remarked. "I am sorry. I feel for you very much indeed.
But, you see, right behind it all there was poor old Aynesworth,
my own brother, having the devil of a good time, a decent
fellow, in his way, even if he was a bit selfish and inclined to
go the pace a bit. I can stand a man being killed in a fight,
but hang it all, a cold-blooded murder, without a chance! I
can't stick it, Jermyn. If I had a grudge against any man or any
living being in the world, so that I wanted their lives, however
much they may have been in the wrong, I'd want to give them a
show. I'd rather stick a weapon of some sort in their hands and
fight it out with them. Wouldn't you? You wouldn't go and take
their life without giving them a chance? It's a dog's death and
I can't bring myself to sympathize for one moment with a
murderer, whatever the provocation."</p>

<p>"You are right, of course," Jermyn admitted. "Things must go
their own way, Gerald. On the other hand, if anything happens to
Miss Cluley, I shall come back to England at once. Every
farthing I have in the world, if it is necessary, will be spent
in her defense. And there's something else, Gerald. If I find
that that fellow Grayson has been concocting any
evidence&mdash;those creatures aren't above it, you
know&mdash;I'll thrash him within an inch of his life!"</p>

<p>Gerald rose slowly to his feet.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," he declared, "if I thought Grayson capable
of anything of the sort, I wouldn't employ him. As regards the
rest, you make me wonder some times," he went on, as he
stretched out his hand for his gloves and stick, "what half the
rest of London are wondering&mdash;why you didn't marry Sybil
Cluley?"</p>

<p>Jermyn's features were suddenly of stone.</p>

<p>"Miss Cluley was indisposed to leave the stage, for one
thing," he replied. "We came to the conclusion that we had been
a little hasty. Nothing that passed, though," he added, "has
interfered in the slightest degree with the profound respect and
esteem which I have for her."</p>

<p>Gerald nodded.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "it's not my business. Good luck to you,
Jermyn! Sorry I can't be there to see you turned off. I've sent
my bit of an offering to Lucille. Look Cyril up in Rome, won't
you&mdash;he's having a fairly good time at the Embassy. And so
long."</p>

<p>Jermyn threw himself into his easy-chair. As he had opened
the door to show Gerald out, he had caught sight once more of
his trunks. His servants had come in with some casual inquiry
about the journey. Perhaps for the first time he realized that
the days of his respite had passed, that only the few short
hours of night lay between him and his marriage to Lucille. It
was for this, then, that in a world which seemed to have
deliberately eschewed them, he had held fast to certain
primitive and exceedingly unfashionable ideals of masculine
conduct which he had brought with him from Oxford! He was, after
all, only as other men. He had resisted a hundred temptations;
he had fought with himself the long, silent battles which go to
the making of character. He had waved away the cup which had so
often been raised to his lips, to give himself in the end,
unwillingly and in humiliation, to a woman for whom he had no
love. It was a queer end to a strenuous celibacy!...He looked
into the fire and he wondered whether Sybil, too, sat in that
little room of hers, thinking of these passing hours. Somehow or
other, notwithstanding his hatred of Grayson, notwithstanding
Gerald's warning, even, the terror which had been with him
during the last few weeks was becoming all the time a less real
thing. He believed implicitly in Lucille; he believed implicitly
in that utter lack of evidence which must keep Sybil safe. And
yet, what was there could save her from her own thoughts? What a
horrible shadow over her young life! This was what his love had
brought to her, love as pure and strong as any man could feel,
love which, alas! stripped of all its joys, redolent only of
pain, must dwell in his empty heart through all the years to
come.</p>

<p>He rose restlessly from his place and threw open the window
to let in the roar of the city. The silence of his room had
depressed him miserably. The blended voices of the night
maddened him. Almost he could fancy that he heard peals of
mocking laughter, the laughter of the world if only they could
know the truth. She sat alone, the woman whom he loved, and he,
instead of being by her side, must spend this last evening in
still more utter and complete solitude. At that moment he
regretted himself. He craved even for that more complete
paganism which, eliminated somehow from his heart during those
earlier and strenuous days, had left him without the sympathy of
so many of his fellow-creatures. He looked up at his gods and
he hated them. For the first time he felt disposed to despise
and even to ridicule his non-acceptance of the middle-class
standards of his sex, which kept him apart now from those whose
sympathy and companionship might have made life an easier thing.
There was no man to whom he could tell his troubles. There was
no man in the world to whom he could speak of the pain which
throbbed at his heart. There was no man who would understand, no
friend's voice to tell him that he was doing well, that in the
days to come he and she would rejoice. This was the price he was
to pay!</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p class="first">Neither an earthquake nor a miracle happened.
At half-past two on the following afternoon, Lucille and Jermyn
passed down the red druggeted path, along the tented way, and,
with the clashing of bells behind them, drove from the church
where they had been married to the hotel in Hans Crescent where
the reception was to be held. Lucille gripped her companion's
hand and, leaning a little forward, glanced at him
curiously.</p>

<p>"My dear Jermyn," she exclaimed, "it is indeed you who might
be the bride to-day! You are so pale, and your eyes seem to see
things so far off. Do, for the sake of my vanity, cultivate more
the air of the happy bridegroom. Look at me."</p>

<p>He turned and obeyed her. At that very moment, half a score
of journalists were writing that the most beautiful woman in
London had just been married. There was, without a doubt, some
truth in their words. Lucille was exquisite, more fascinating
than ever with this touch of scarlet in her cheeks, this gleam
of real excitement in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Kiss me, Jermyn," she whispered. "Let me see whether I can't
bring just a shade of color into your cheeks."</p>

<p>He touched her lips with his own but drew back almost at
once.</p>

<p>"Lucille," he said, "I shall do my best. Don't treat me,
though, as if I were a child, to be coaxed from ill-humors into
good ones by kisses and sweetmeats. I have paid your price.
Isn't that enough?"</p>

<p>"Not nearly enough," she murmured. "You are my husband now,
indeed, as I always prayed that some day you might be, but there
are other things, you know, which I have a right to expect from
you besides your name. I want you to look as though you are glad
I belong to you."</p>

<p>"I am no actor, but I will do my best," he promised. "I will
do my best now and I will do my best always to make you happy,
but if I fail, remember that it was your risk and not mine."</p>

<p>Arrived at the hotel, they separated, to meet again a few
minutes later in the reception room. Already the guests were
beginning to stream in. The quiet wedding had grown and grown.
People had begged to be allowed just to look in, to shake hands
with the bridegroom, to wish happiness to the bride. And all the
time the carriages kept arriving. Jermyn, whose natural
instincts were all courteous ones, moved continually about among
his guests, returning now and then to Lucille's side. Every one
spoke to him about her wonderful beauty. It was surely the one
day of her life! She was brilliant, she said the right thing to
every one, her attitude even towards Jermyn was perfect. Despite
himself, she made him appear at his best. People began to remark
that, notwithstanding a certain amount of gossip, this seemed
likely to be a most successful match.</p>

<p>The rooms were almost filled when Jermyn, who was in the act
of raising a glass to his lips to drink with an old friend,
became suddenly rigid. He set the glass down and, with a word of
excuse, crossed the room to where a man was standing a little
apart from the others, looking in upon the gay scene. He was
dressed in conventional fashion, he wore even a white flower in
his buttonhole, and a gray tie, but there was no mistaking
Grayson.</p>

<p>"May I ask," Jermyn inquired, doing his best to speak calmly,
"to what we are indebted for the pleasure of your presence
here?"</p>

<p>Grayson faced his questioner with equanimity.</p>

<p>"Sir Jermyn," he replied, "I am here in the discharge of my
duty. My investigations have carried me up to a certain point
and beyond it. I am associated now with the law and I must ask
you to respect my position."</p>

<p>"What the devil do you mean?" Jermyn demanded, in a low
tone.</p>

<p>Grayson glanced around. They were on the edge of a little
crowd of people and conversation was not easy.</p>

<p>"Sir Jermyn," he advised, "go back to your place and leave me
alone. Within a few minutes you will know the solution of that
mystery which I am afraid has brought unhappiness to a good many
people."</p>

<p>"You mean to say," Jermyn persisted, "that you are going to
make an arrest&mdash;an arrest here?"</p>

<p>"I am going to assist in that, beyond a doubt," Grayson told
him.</p>

<p>"Among my guests?"</p>

<p>"Among your guests, Sir Jermyn."</p>

<p>For a moment the room seemed to swim. Jermyn looked around
him wildly. That Sybil should find her way here seemed to him,
of all impossible things in the world, the most impossible! Then
came an interruption which it was impossible to ignore. The Duke
of Rochester touched him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"My dear Jermyn," he said, "as your father's oldest friend it
is my privilege to come here to-day to drink a glass of wine
with you and to wish you every happiness. I am an invalid and
allowed to stay for only a short time. You will forgive me,
therefore, I am sure, if I interrupt your conversation with this
gentleman."</p>

<p>The small conventionalities of life often sweep aside the
great tragedies. Jermyn walked side by side with the Duke to the
buffet, around which so many groups were gathered together.</p>

<p>"I was your father's school and college friend," the Duke
remarked, as they took their glasses of wine from the waiter. "I
tipped you when you wore your first pair of trousers; I was at
Lord's when you made your first century; I proposed your health
the day you came of age. I have known Lucille, too, all her
life. She is an exceedingly clever woman. If you are ambitious,
Jermyn, and they tell me that you are, I know of no one who
could make you a better wife. I drink to your happiness, I drink
to the happiness of your married life. Ah, here comes Lucille!
It is charming to be able to include her in my good wishes."</p>

<p>He held out his hands. Lucille greeted him with a delightful
smile. There was a man by her side&mdash;clean-shaven, broad,
good-looking in his way, with a dash of the transatlantic about
his carriage. She kept the Duke with her right hand while she
spoke to Jermyn.</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she said, "it was only the other day that I heard
you mention the name of Mr. Aaron Chalmers. I met him yesterday
and asked him to come in and see us this afternoon. He would
like to make your acquaintance."</p>

<p>"And to offer you," Mr. Chalmers declared, with a little bow,
"my very heartiest congratulations. I cannot conceive the
possibility of there being a happier man upon the face of this
earth than the man who has the good fortune to be the husband of
my dear friend, the Duchesse de Sayers."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," Jermyn murmured, as he shook hands. "I
remember asking my wife whether she had seen anything of you
lately, only the other day, because an acquaintance, a
fellow-countryman of yours, by the by, asked me particularly
where he could find you."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" Mr. Chalmers remarked, good-humoredly. "What
was his name?"</p>

<p>"His name," Jermyn replied, "was Norden Smith."</p>

<p>Mr. Aaron Chalmers stopped in the middle of drinking his
champagne. He looked fixedly at Jermyn. Then he drained the
contents of the glass and set it down.</p>

<p>"Is Norden Smith over here now?" he inquired, in a completely
altered tone.</p>

<p>"I don't think that he is," Jermyn answered. "It was a little
over a fortnight ago that I met him in Bond Street. He lunched
with me at my club and at his request I made some inquiries
about your whereabouts. They told us that you were in the
States. I have not seen Norden Smith since, but I have an idea
that he intended leaving for New York a few days later."</p>

<p>Mr. Aaron Chalmers, although he had not regained his former
appearance of complacent good-humor, seemed to be somewhat
relieved.</p>

<p>"Well," he declared, "I wish the fellow no harm, but I shall
be very glad to think that he is going to stay there. Between
you and me, Sir Jermyn, Mr. Norden Smith is somewhat of a crank.
He has a particularly charming and attractive wife, whom I have
the pleasure of knowing, but as regards Mr. Norden Smith
himself, well, I should be just as well content to think that we
were not going to meet again in this world. Do you know him
intimately, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," Jermyn replied. "I only met him once
before this time. He called to see me one night at Annerley. He
was anxious to renew his acquaintance with Lord Lakenham, who he
heard was staying with me."</p>

<p>"And did he?" Mr. Chalmers asked, in a very low tone.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, no!" Jermyn answered. "Mr. Norden Smith
arrived at Annerley Court only a very few minutes after a sad
tragedy had happened there. You read, without a doubt, of the
murder of Lord Lakenham? It took place, as you may remember, in
my house."</p>

<p>Mr. Aaron Chalmers, for a strong man, seemed curiously
emotional. He picked up his empty glass and held it to the
waiter.</p>

<p>"Fill this quickly," he ordered.</p>

<p>The man obeyed him. The hand of Mr. Aaron Chalmers shook so
that some of the wine was spilt upon the carpet. Mr. Chalmers
made no apology. He lifted the glass to his lips and drained all
of the wine that was left.</p>

<p>"Sir Jermyn," he remarked, "I am glad you have told me this.
The man Norden Smith is a lunatic. He is one of those people who
go about the world with a single weird, distorted idea. He ought
to be locked up. He is one&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Aaron Chalmers said no more. Such change as there had
been in him before from the complacent man of the world whom
Lucille had introduced to Jermyn, was nothing to the change
which was apparent in him now. His jaw hung loose, his eyes were
fixed and glazed, he was shaking like a frightened schoolboy.
Then across the room with measured footsteps, also with a white
flower in his buttonhole, came Mr. Norden Smith, and as fast as
Mr. Norden Smith moved towards the bridegroom as though with the
intention of congratulating him, so, only a little faster, came
Mr. Grayson from his place on the outside of the circle.</p>

<p>"Sir Jermyn," Mr. Norden Smith declared, "I congratulate you.
Give me your hand, sir."</p>

<p>Jermyn recognized his visitor with surprise.</p>

<p>"Norden Smith!" he exclaimed. "Why, your name was upon my
lips only a moment ago. You are back again from America already,
then? I am glad to see you."</p>

<p>Mr. Norden Smith wrung his hand.</p>

<p>"I trust," he said, "that I shall not in any way disturb the
serenity of this function. I would gladly postpone a little
matter I have on hand, but for the fact that I am afraid it has
become one of urgency. Sir Jermyn, to-day you enter upon married
life. Fifteen years ago I, too, was married. I have loved my
wife every second of my days, with every thought of my brain,
with every pulse of my body. Fate decreed that my love should be
unworthily given. A few months ago I made a discovery which has
brought these gray hairs to my head, which brought tragedy to
your peaceful home at Annerley, which brings tragedy even to
your wedding breakfast. It was I who shot Lord Lakenham, it is I
who at this minute am about to shoot Aaron Chalmers. These two
men robbed me of my wife. Lord Lakenham has paid the penalty.
Aaron Chalmers now pays it!"</p>

<p>It was an affair of a moment. Even as Grayson sprang upon him
and another stranger from among the crowd threw an arm around
him from the other side, the hand of Mr. Norden Smith flashed
out. There was a little puff of smoke, a report, and Aaron
Chalmers went backwards, a crumbled heap upon the floor. Mr.
Norden Smith stood with the pistol still in his hand, gazing
down upon the prostrate form with a smile of peculiar
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, looking away as though with
reluctance from the body of his enemy, "I offer you my heartfelt
apologies. I represent a spectre at this feast, and yet, in a
sense, there is meaning in my presence. I am one of those who
believe in fidelity and who repay infidelity with death. That is
my mission here. Perhaps you have drunk the health of your bride
and bridegroom to-day. Perhaps you have spoken to them of the
duties of married life. Here is a little background for your
text. With the bullet which has entered that man's heart, I have
repaid the broken vows of a wife whom I have loved as dearly as
any of you have loved one another. It is my pleasure to pay
whatever penalty the laws can inflict."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the commotion, every word of Mr. Norden
Smith's little speech was plainly audible. One or two of the men
were bending over Chalmers, but the people mostly had fallen
away, many of the women with their hands before their faces. A
group of people, gathered at the buffet, stood as though
transfixed, with their wineglasses still in their hands. Jermyn,
with his fingers gripping Grayson's shoulders, was asking him
questions in a low, fierce whisper. Mr. Norden Smith himself
handed his weapon to the man in whose grip he was.</p>

<p>"Be careful," he enjoined. "There is still another barrel
loaded. You see, I have not used it even for myself. I want the
pleasure of the next few days, the pleasure of reflecting upon
what I have done. My apologies, Sir Jermyn! Might I suggest,
sir," he added to Grayson, "that you and your companion handcuff
me and take me away at once, so that this little ceremony can
proceed?"</p>

<p>He walked blithely to the door between his two guards. He
left behind him a scene of complete and dramatic confusion. Two
women had fainted; another was in hysterics. Many were looking
about them in a vacant sort of way, as though they found it
impossible to realize the tragedy of the whole proceeding.
Across the heads of their guests, Lucille and Jermyn stood
looking at one another!</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<p class="first">With the departure of Norden Smith, people
seemed to recover from their stupefaction. With one accord they
hastened to take their leave. In a very few moments there were
left in the room only Lucille and Jermyn, Lucille's friend and
bridal attendant&mdash;Lady Florence Effingham, and Jermyn's
best man&mdash;the Honorable Holland Rorke. Neither Lucille nor
Jermyn had spoken a word. It was Rorke who attacked the subject,
first helping himself to a glass of champagne.</p>

<p>"After all, you know," he declared, "I am not sure that this
ought not to be a relief to everybody. Frightfully dramatic and
all that, and a terrible shock to you people it must have been,
and I am sorry for poor old Chalmers, who wasn't such a bad
sort, but when you come to think of it, it is rather a relief to
have this matter of Lakenham's death straightened out."</p>

<p>"A very sensible point of view," Lady Florence agreed. "Of
course, I think it was the worst possible taste of that man to
come and make such a hateful scene here. I am sure I am shaking
all over. The best thing we can do now, though, is to try and
forget it. Come along, Lucille, it's time you changed your
frock."</p>

<p>Lucille turned towards the door. Then Jermyn spoke for the
first time.</p>

<p>"Lucille," he said, "before you go upstairs may I have one
word with you?"</p>

<p>He pointed to the door of the anteroom. Lucille hesitated.
Once more their eyes met and she began to tremble.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it do," she ventured, "in the carriage or in the
train? I am just a little shaken for the moment. I should be so
glad to rest until the time came to start."</p>

<p>Jermyn's fingers still pointed toward the door.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he replied. "I will not keep you for more than
a minute or two."</p>

<p>Lucille had the air of one looking around her as though
anxious to escape. There was no escape, however. Jermyn's voice
was so quiet and yet so decided that neither of the other two
interfered. Very slowly Lucille turned and crossed the room
towards the inner chamber. Jermyn followed her and closed the
door behind them.</p>

<p>"Lucille," he said, "I am waiting for your explanation."</p>

<p>She made her way to an easy-chair, groping her way with her
hands as though she were in fear of falling. Then she threw
herself into it and, leaning over the side, kept her head turned
from him.</p>

<p>"I thought that Sybil Cluley did it," she declared. "I
determined to make you believe that she did&mdash;it was better
for you."</p>

<p>"Is that your explanation?" Jermyn asked.</p>

<p>She made no answer. Jermyn came a little nearer. He stood
upon the hearthrug, looking down at her.</p>

<p>"Lucille," he continued, "I cannot bring myself to believe,
even now, that you have stooped so low, that you have acted so
shameful a part. You say that you believed Sybil Cluley was
guilty. To me you swore it. You have posed ever since as having
saved her. You made me believe that but for you she would have
been arrested. My God," he went on, his voice shaking for the
first time, "you did more! You made me believe that she was
guilty!"</p>

<p>Lucille kept her head down. She said nothing.</p>

<p>"Do you mean, then, that you have no further explanation to
offer me than this?" Jermyn persisted. "You have induced me to
go through this d&mdash;d ceremony by a trick! What do you
expect to gain by it now? Do you imagine for a moment that I
shall consider myself your husband?"</p>

<p>She looked up.</p>

<p>"You are my husband," she reminded him. "Nothing can alter
that."</p>

<p>Jermyn's eyes suddenly caught flame.</p>

<p>"You wear my name," he cried brutally, "if that is any use to
you! What else of me do you claim? My company? My protection?
Rubbish! There isn't a woman upon the face of this earth,
Lucille, today, whom I dislike and despise as I do you."</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet and stood before him, quivering. His
words had stung through her fears. She was ready now to
fight.</p>

<p>"You fool, Jermyn!" she exclaimed. "Can't you see that what I
did, I did for your own sake as well as mine? I did nobody any
harm. I just wanted to save you from making a miserable
marriage. You're not one of those who go about the world with
their eyes open. You're at home in your study, or surrounded
with your books, or on the hilltops or in the beautiful lonely
places of the world, but when you come down into the market-place
you're an idiot. Do you hear that&mdash;an idiot! You need
a keeper all the time. Your very vision is distorted. You know
about many things in life. You know the springs that govern
human action. Your plays are wonderful pieces of geometrical
psychology. But the real men and women of our days, whom one
meets as one passes along, you know no more about, Jermyn, than
the Arab who rides his camel across the desert. You, Jermyn
Annerley, daring to tell us down at Annerley that you were going
to marry a little girl from the theatre, a daughter, without a
doubt, of some poor tradespeople, a girl who has had to struggle
all through her youth to get engagements, making herself
agreeable to all sorts and conditions of impossible people,
living half the time in want, living always in the sort of way
those people must. Yet you can sit in your study and you make a
heroine come down to you from the skies, and you clothe her and
make her beautiful, and you carry her with you in your brain and
in your heart, and you wander out into that little bit of London
you call the world and find this moon-faced chit, who can chant
your speeches prettily and knows all the tricks of saying them,
and you immediately shower upon her all the wealth of your
fancy, you throw yourself at her feet&mdash;she, this little
actress, is to be dressed in all those wonderful garments, and
you <i>won't</i> see, you won't see that they never could fit.
Oh, you fool, Jermyn! You fool! I haven't spoken a word about
myself. It's as much for your own sake as for any one's that I
have saved you from tying up your life unworthily."</p>

<p>"Have you finished?"</p>

<p>"Isn't it enough?" she demanded. "Well, I've spoken of her.
Shall I tell you of myself, too? Haven't you heard it already?
Look at me. I've told you about the other men. Well, I'll tell
you about myself. A woman who is built as I am, Jermyn, loves
only once. I have read as much poetry as you have, thought as
many beautiful thoughts, kept my footsteps clean from the muddy
places; but all the same I have lived in the world. That's the
difference. The strings of life have pulled at me, they have
kept my feet upon the earth, and I have measured men and
speeches and gone serenely on, content to wait for the greater
things. Jermyn, don't look at me as though I were some one far
away. It is the one jewel of life which I offer to you, and I've
kept it just as jealously as you have cherished your impossible
fancies. Don't you feel it? Aren't you big enough to know it? I
love you with all my heart and all my soul. I love you so that
it was torture to me to sit at your table and watch you and that
girl. I don't understand it; no one does understand these
things. But, Jermyn, if love will make you happy, if love can
keep you young, come here, come to me. There isn't anybody in
the world can give you what I can give. There isn't as much love
for you in the whole shallow heart of your little comedy actress
as you can take from my lips now, always, every time you touch
them. Jermyn!"</p>

<p>Her arms called to him, her lips, her eyes. In her tone had
rung the triumphant consciousness of truth, overwhelming,
self-convicting, truth which neither anticipates nor believes in
denial. Even when she had finished, she did not for a moment
realize her failure. Something in the artistic subconsciousness
of the man had leaped up, responsive to the fine quality of her
words, to the compelling truth, the almost anguished appeal
which burned in her sentences. The color had come into his
cheeks; his eyes were glowing. It was a wonderful change. She
had never seen Jermyn like this. He was human, after all. Surely
she had succeeded! His tone, too, when he spoke, was different,
was gentler, kinder.</p>

<p>"Lucille," he said, "very well. Now listen to me."</p>

<p>She moved towards him. Her bosom was rising and falling
madly. Her lips were parted, her eyes implored him, her fingers
sought for his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I don't want words," she begged, "I want you."</p>

<p>He gripped her wrists and held her from him or she would have
been in his arms.</p>

<p>"Lucille," he continued, "thank yourself for what comes. You
have awakened the brute in me and it is the brute who speaks.
What do you expect? To' buy me, a slave? To make me complacent
with your caresses? Rubbish! If you are a woman, am I not a man?
I've chosen my mate and I want her."</p>

<p>"But you are my husband!" Lucille called out. "You are my
husband!"</p>

<p>"Much good may it do you!" he answered fiercely. "You have
made me go through that wretched ceremony. Do you feel any
different? Does it help you? Do you feel that you own me any the
more? Think it over&mdash;you'll have time."</p>

<p>He turned towards the door. Her eyes were full of fear.</p>

<p>"Jermyn!" she cried. "You're not going to leave me?"</p>

<p>"What else?" he demanded. "Do you suppose I am going
honeymooning with you? I am going to find Sybil and tell her the
truth. She shall choose. She shall make my future whatever it is
to be, not you."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't dare!" Lucille muttered. "Today you wouldn't
dare to go to her!"</p>

<p>Jermyn took no notice. Already he had reached the door. He
did not even look back. She almost flung herself upon him.</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she pleaded, "be merciful. Consider what will
happen if you leave me like this. The carriage is ordered for an
hour's time. Our places are taken in the train to Folkestone.
You can't do it! You can't make me the laughing stock of Europe!
You may be cruel but you can't be brutal enough for that!
Besides, think of yourself&mdash;of your own position. Will you
have it said that you left me to go to her to-day? It's too
hateful to think of! Stay where you are. I will be sensible,
only wait. I must think of something."</p>

<p>She stood with her hand to her forehead. He looked at her
steadfastly.</p>

<p>"What is it, then, that you propose?" he asked. "There is
nothing in this world will keep me from going straight to Sybil
when I leave this hotel. Every moment I hold over my confession
is a moment longer of shame."</p>

<p>"Very well," she said, "I do not keep you. Go to her. Tell
her the truth&mdash;the whole truth, if you will. Don't spare
me. But, Jermyn, you have at least the instincts&mdash;forgive
the bathos of the word but I cannot think of another&mdash;of a
gentleman. You won't leave me to be made fun of in every
drawing-room of the world! I will change my clothes and drive to
Victoria. I will explain that you are to meet me there. You
<i>must</i> meet me there, you <i>must</i> travel to Folkestone
with me. On the way we can talk. If I cannot convince you, if
you still remain as you are now, then let us separate somehow
quietly. But I won't be left like this!"</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"It is now," he declared, "a quarter to four. If I am able to
find Sybil, I will be at Victoria in time to catch the train. My
luggage shall be there. I will try to save you from what you
seem to fear so greatly. If, on the other hand, I cannot find
Sybil, I will come to the station but I shall most certainly
return, for nothing in this world would induce me to leave
London until I have seen her."</p>

<p>Lucille half closed her eyes for a moment. Once more she
tried, sadly, almost hopelessly, to win a kinder look from him.
She raised his fingers to her lips and kissed them.</p>

<p>"I can't say any more, Jermyn," she murmured. "I feel rather
crushed. It must be as you decide. Will you go and tell Florence
that I am ready for her? Get rid of Holland, if you can, or take
him with you. I couldn't bear any one with us."</p>

<p>Jermyn did as he was bidden. Then he hurried downstairs to
where his car was waiting. His servant, who was standing in the
hall, looked at him in some surprise.</p>

<p>"You won't change your things, sir?" he asked. "Everything is
put out here."</p>

<p>"Not just yet," Jermyn replied. "I shall have to travel as I
am. There is something I must see to first. You can pack up my
dressing-case and send it on with the other luggage."</p>

<p>He stepped into the car and lifted the tube to his mouth.</p>

<p>"Burley Court," he told the man.</p>

<p>They moved off. Jermyn drew out the white flower which
Lucille had pinned in his buttonhole, and sat crushing it
fiercely in his hand.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<p class="first">Sybil's maid, who opened the door to him, gazed
at this unexpected visitor in blank amazement.</p>

<p>"I must see your mistress at once," he announced. "I hope she
is in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is in, Sir Jermyn," the maid replied, doubtfully.
"She has a headache and was lying down. I don't know&mdash;I
suppose she will see you, sir."</p>

<p>Jermyn stepped into the hall and flung the silk hat which he
was carrying, on to the little hat-stand.</p>

<p>"Beg her to come to me as soon as possible," he said. "Tell
her that it is most important."</p>

<p>He made his way into the sitting-room. It was neat and
orderly as usual and filled with pretty, inexpensive yellow
flowers. The windows were open and a small fire was burning on
the grate. There were one or two letters, unopened, on the table
by the side of the chair in which she generally sat. He walked
restlessly up and down the little apartment. His brain was in a
complete turmoil, there were so many things which still were
puzzling him. If Sybil were not guilty, and had known all the
time that she was not guilty, how was he to account for her
attitude, the terror in her face and eyes, the instinctive
manner with which she had accepted the story of his sacrifice?
He held his forehead. He seemed to be looking out upon a blank
wall. If only she would come! He kept on look ing impatiently
toward the door. It seemed to him that he was waiting there for
an eternity. It was, in reality, less than five minutes. Then
for a moment he forgot everything else in a great wave of
shuddering pity. She had been crying, crying all night. Her eyes
were red and swollen, there were black lines under them which he
had never seen before. She seemed to have become paler and more
fragile. He took a step towards her and held out his arms.</p>

<p>"Before I speak, Sybil," he almost sobbed, "for God's sake,
kiss me!"</p>

<p>She gave a little wondering cry. He kissed her eyes and he
kissed her lips tenderly.</p>

<p>"Little woman," he whispered, "you have been suffering."</p>

<p>"But I don't understand," she gasped. "What are you doing
here? The wedding?"</p>

<p>He led her to the easy-chair and knelt by her side.</p>

<p>"Listen, Sybil," he began; "answer me one question or I shall
go mad. Who did you suppose had killed Aynesworth Lakenham?"</p>

<p>There were no more emotions which her face could show. She
answered him quite simply.</p>

<p>"Why, you!"</p>

<p>"My God!" he murmured. "Could we have been such
children!"</p>

<p>"Didn't you?" she suddenly called out, sitting up in her
chair. "Tell me, Jermyn, didn't you kill him?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered, "I didn't."</p>

<p>"Then why," she demanded breathlessly, "did you tell me that
you were marrying Lucille de Sayers because she knew?"</p>

<p>He drew a little breath and held both her hands.</p>

<p>"Because, while the police were in the avenue, when there
were only a few moments to spare, she told me secretly that she
knew that you had done it&mdash;you, Sybil&mdash;that she had
seen you! I believed her! When I told you that I was marrying
her because she knew the truth, I meant that I was marrying her
not to save myself but to seal her lips about you."</p>

<p>Sybil's hands were pressed to her temples.</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;no, I can't realize it all yet," she said. "It
will have to come slowly. But tell me now&mdash;is there
anything fresh, then? Who did kill him?"</p>

<p>"The American&mdash;Norden Smith! He came to Annerley to kill
him; he came to Europe for no other purpose. He has killed
another man to-day&mdash;Aaron Chalmers. They were lovers of
his wife."</p>

<p>"Norden Smith!" she whispered hoarsely. "Why, he didn't come
till afterwards."</p>

<p>"He entered the billiard-room by the windows from the
garden," Jermyn explained quickly. "Then he stole out again and
rang the front door bell. It was absolutely simple."</p>

<p>"And I thought it was you!" she gasped. "I saw some one
coming outside while he was holding me. I thought that it was
you! I ran away directly he let me go. I thought that it was you
who came in through the window! Why, I went to his room that
night&mdash;it was horrible!&mdash;went and knocked at his door
to beg him to keep silence. I shall never forget that awful
night! They wouldn't let me in."</p>

<p>"And I thought you went for yourself!" he murmured.</p>

<p>She laughed a little unsteadily.</p>

<p>"I'd never have pleaded for my own life from him!"</p>

<p>"I am trying to think all the time why I believed Lucille,"
Jermyn went on. "She gave me the pistol which she said she had
seen in your hand. Norden Smith showed me little fragments of
your white satin dress, which were scattered upon the floor;
showed them to me secretly because he said they might be used as
evidence against you. He was honest enough there, but, of
course, it all seemed to point to the same thing. This will come
clearer to us presently, when we think over our conversations.
Just now I can't realize it all. I can't realize how miserably
we have been at cross-purposes."</p>

<p>She suddenly sat up in her chair. Her face grew lighter. A
splendid gleam of joy lit up her eyes.</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she cried rapturously, "you didn't kill him, I
didn't kill him! We have each suffered for the other, suffered
in vain. We have lived through all this agony for nothing."</p>

<p>"And we have lived through it," he added, "twenty-four hours
too long!"</p>

<p>She looked at him without comprehension for a moment. Then
she glanced at his clothes and drew away. He had been holding
her in his arms.</p>

<p>"It was afterwards?"</p>

<p>"It was at the reception," he told her. "All London will be
ringing with it to-morrow. The daily press hasn't been provided
with such a sensation for many a year. Norden Smith was at the
reception, lying in wait for Chalmers. There was a man named
Grayson, the private detective whom Gerald Lakenham had
employed, who was on his track; the man who pretended he was
watching you and me. He was on to Norden Smith from the first.
He had finished his investigations and gone to Scotland Yard.
They were waiting to arrest him outside. Except for an accident
he would have been arrested in the entrance hall of the hotel.
He happened to slip by them so they had to follow him into the
reception room. He shot Aaron Chalmers through the heart, dead,
and then he told us all the truth."</p>

<p>"I can't realize it," she murmured. "It seems too wonderful.
This happened this afternoon at your reception? You saw it done?
You saw this man Chalmers murdered?"</p>

<p>"I and fifty others," Jermyn replied. "And after it was over,
Norden Smith confessed. He came to Annerley for no other purpose
but to kill Aynesworth. He passed along the terrace, saw the
billiard-room windows open, saw you and Aynesworth struggling.
Aynesworth heard him coming and let you go. You turned and fled,
thinking it was I. Then he shot Aynesworth, went calmly out of
the window again, rang the bell at the front door, and in less
than a minute was shown into the bridge-room."</p>

<p>Her hand was still clasping her head.</p>

<p>"I am getting hold of it by degrees," she said. "To think
that I have had this weight on my conscience all the time! I
thought that you had seen him behaving like a brute and that you
had shot him, and that the quarrel was all my fault because I
had not told you everything at once."</p>

<p>"And I," he echoed, "dared to think that you had shot him
sooner than have him tell me that miserable story! Give me your
hands, dear. Let us sit quite quietly for a few minutes. I want
to realize things."</p>

<p>Her head dropped upon his shoulder. He held both her hands
tightly. She breathed a deep sigh of content. Then, after a
time, she drew a little away.</p>

<p>"The Duchess!" she faltered. "What has she to say?"</p>

<p>Jermyn's face hardened.</p>

<p>"I have spoken with her alone," he said. "She was forced to
admit the truth. She had only one idea&mdash;she wanted to come
between us. It was just a chance and she took it."</p>

<p>"She cares for you," Sybil declared. "I knew it always. Tell
me what happened after the tragedy?"</p>

<p>"The people all went away. I took Lucille into an anteroom. I
forced the truth from her. Then I came here."</p>

<p>"It was like you to come at once," Sybil murmured. "Bless you
for it! But you mustn't stay, must you?"</p>

<p>She glanced at the clock. Jermyn remained silent. His arms
tightened a little upon hers.</p>

<p>"Sybil," he said, "you know the truth. Do you want me to go?
Do you think it is right that I should leave you?"</p>

<p>Sybil shook her head.</p>

<p>"I can't think about it at all, dear. It is all too
complicated and extraordinary. Only you must not leave her alone
now."</p>

<p>"Very soon," he continued, "she will be waiting for me at
Victoria Station. Whether I go with her or not rests with you.
Sybil,&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her hand was suddenly pressed upon his mouth. She looked at
him and smiled. She seemed, indeed, to have grown younger and
more childlike.</p>

<p>"Dear Jermyn," she said, "an hour ago I never dreamed that
any gleam of happiness could come to me to-day. This is all
wonderful. Exactly how life will shape itself for either of us
in the future, I do not know do you? But there isn't any doubt
about one thing; you must go away now, you must go to
her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The ceremony was a trick!" he interrupted.</p>

<p>"Never mind," she answered. "She could only have done it for
one thing, you know&mdash;because she cared. Besides, she bears
your name now. Whatever you may decide that you do not owe her,
you do at least owe her the protection of your presence and
name. You cannot leave her there. You must go away with her just
as you had arranged. For the rest, just yet, I cannot
think&mdash;I cannot think."</p>

<p>"If I go," he cried harshly, "you can't believe that I go
save in one way only?"</p>

<p>She closed her eyes.</p>

<p>"I can't think it all out, Jermyn dear," she went on. "Just
at first I know that you will feel like that. I am so thankful,
so very thankful that you and I are a little different from
other people. We have fought our fight, haven't we, and come to
our own. Whatever happens, I shall never be altogether deprived
of your companionship. I know that. You will have your work. You
and I will often see it grow together. I shall always hope that
I may help. But my place, Jermyn, is very clearly defined, isn't
it? There isn't anything in this world now can alter that."</p>

<p>He rose slowly to his feet.</p>

<p>"Ah, no," she begged, stretching out her hands to him, "don't
look like that! It is only a little part of you that feels
bitter and reproachful. You know yourself that when we are
happiest, you and I, we are walk ing hand in hand in the fairy
places, and we can't take the things there that don't belong.
You know it so well, dear. The other things&mdash;oh, they are
very sweet and very overmastering, and they tempt&mdash;yes,
they tempt all the time, but you and I are brave. You will help
me and I shall help you. Kiss me, Jermyn."</p>

<p>She gave him her lips. He kissed her tenderly, kissed her
eyes, kissed her hands. Still he remained silent. She passed her
arm through his and led him to the door.</p>

<p>"Dear," she whispered, "there are many sorts of happiness in
the world. For the last few hours, I will admit that I have been
suffering all the miseries of a jealous, tortured woman. Now you
are going away, and you are going away with your wife, and I am
feeling happier and lighter-hearted than I have felt for weeks
and weeks. There's lots in life yet. You'll write me, won't you?
And you won't forget Mary? The best of voyages to you, Jermyn;
and, dear, good-by! God bless you!"</p>

<p>She closed the door just a little abruptly. Jermyn made his
way down to his car and drove to Victoria. In front of the
book-stall Lucille was standing, with her maid and Lady Florence by
her side. Holland came bustling up with the tickets.</p>

<p>"Everything's all right," he declared. "Luggage all in,
reserved carriage, and servants close to. Come along."</p>

<p>Lucille passed a handful of magazines to Jermyn.</p>

<p>"Please pay for these," she said.</p>

<p>Her tone was quite matter-of-fact, but her hand was shaking
violently. She raised her veil for a moment as they walked out
on to the platform. Lady Florence was anxious and whispered in
her ear, but she only shook her head.</p>

<p>"I felt just a little faint," she admitted. "Jermyn came
round the corner rather suddenly. It has been such an
extraordinary afternoon, hasn't it? Is this our carriage?"</p>

<p>Jermyn handed her in. The guard himself was standing at the
door; a reporter was making notes at a little distance; a
photographer took a snapshot of them. Jermyn looked out at it
all, unmoved. He had shaken hands with Lady Florence and Holland
and was standing now behind Lucille, who held both her hands out
of the window.</p>

<p>"You'll write to us, dear?"</p>

<p>"The best of luck, old chap!"</p>

<p>Lucille threw kisses and waved her handkerchief as the train
glided away. Then she sat back in her place. Jermyn had already
taken the opposite seat. Her eyes glowed at him; her lips
quivered with eagerness.</p>

<p>"You are coming!"</p>

<p>He looked at her without the slightest change of expression.
The fierce inquiry of her eyes remained unanswered.</p>

<p>"I am coming," he replied, taking up one of the magazines,
"to give you the protection of my name."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch33" id="ch33"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<p class="first">"Love is the one force in the world which
remains eternal without any sustenance save hope, which lives
and grows and flourishes without culture or care. It is the
rarest flower in life, and when you have found it you have
solved all the mysteries."</p>

<p>It was almost her last speech. As she came to the front of
the stage, carried away though she was by her part, she was yet
acutely conscious of that little note from him which reposed in
the bosom of her gown. A few moments later the curtain fell,
fell as it had done every night for the last two months, to the
accompaniment of loud applause. In the shadows of his box Jermyn
stood quite motionless. Lucille was arranging her scarf before
the mirror. She was purposely looking away.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't care to come to the <i>Carlton</i>, I suppose?"
she inquired, as they stood waiting for their car. "Florence is
going to be there, and the Lindsays. I said that we might turn
up if you had no engagements."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he replied. "I cannot come tonight."</p>

<p>She made no remark. Only when he had handed her into the car
she looked at him for a moment out of her great eyes, hollower
now than a few months ago.</p>

<p>"You are not coming home?"</p>

<p>"Not at present," he answered, raising his hat.</p>

<p>He walked round to the stage door, once a familiar enough
path. The doorkeeper welcomed him cordially. He passed on the
familiar way behind and knocked at the door of the manager's
room. Mr. Levenden was overjoyed to see him.</p>

<p>"My dear Sir Jermyn," he exclaimed, "this is a pleasure! At
last you have seen your own play, then!"</p>

<p>"To-night for the first time," Jermyn replied. "I only
returned this afternoon."</p>

<p>"You know that it's the success of the season, of course?"
the manager continued. "You've read all about that and you've
had our letters. Miss Cluley has surpassed herself. She is
simply wonderful. To judge from the bookings, I should say that
we were good for another year."</p>

<p>"I am hoping to see Miss Cluley," Jermyn remarked.</p>

<p>The manager nodded.</p>

<p>"You know her room," he said. "Perhaps I had better just let
her know that you are here."</p>

<p>She came to them a few minutes later. She had really grown a
little paler and a little thinner during these last months, but
Jermyn saw no change. Their words of greeting were simple
enough. Even the manager, who was watching, saw nothing unusual
in them.</p>

<p>"More wonderful, even, than I had dared to hope!" Jermyn
declared, as he bent over her hands. "You have given my 'Nora'
life. When she spoke to me to-night across the footlights, I
seemed to be back once more in my study, my pen in my hand,
wondering whether I could ever collect into a harmonious whole
those fugitive thoughts. To-night I am very humble. I am driven
to the conclusion that the interpreter's art must come
first."</p>

<p>"You have not traveled abroad for nothing, Sir Jermyn," she
laughed. "You have learned the art of making honeyed
speeches."</p>

<p>They wished Mr. Levenden good-night and turned as though by
mutual consent towards the door.</p>

<p>"You have a car?" he asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Economical as ever," she confessed. "Taxies are so cheap and
so easy to get. The same one comes for me every night. You see,
he is waiting there now. Take me out to supper, won't you, to
some place that's quiet where we can sit and talk? I don't feel
inclined to go home just yet."</p>

<p>He gave the chauffeur a direction and stepped in by her
side.</p>

<p>"It was nice of you to let me know that you were coming," she
said. "I was really glad."</p>

<p>"You like your part? You still find pleasure in it?"</p>

<p>"I find the greatest pleasure of my life in it," she replied
swiftly. "Sometimes in the daytime, when I haven't heard from
Mary, the hours seem so long and I sit and think and shiver. And
then the evening comes and I forget that I am myself at all. I
become Nora, and when I am Nora I am glad, because you made her
and because she is wonderful."</p>

<p>"And how do you suppose," he asked, a little bitterly,
"things have gone with a poor ordinary person who has no other
self into which he can escape?"</p>

<p>She smiled at him delightfully; she let her hand fall on
his.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she murmured, "that is not true. You have the whole
world of your thoughts, a whole garden of beautiful fancies into
which you can pass whenever you will."</p>

<p>"The garden is haunted," he answered, a little hoarsely.
"Always I seem to look for a little seat among the roses, and
the seat is always empty."</p>

<p>"Foolish!" she whispered.</p>

<p>The cab drew up with a little jerk. He handed her out. They
passed into the grill-room of a fashionable restaurant, as yet
only half full. There was no music and the lights were not
brilliant. They chose a table near the wall and Jermyn gave an
order to the <i>mantre d'httel</i>, who recognized him with
pleasure.</p>

<p>"Tell me about yourself?" she begged simply.</p>

<p>"I have had a hard time," he replied. "There is little more
than that, that I can tell you. I have visited many beautiful
places, some which were new to me and others which I have been
longing to revisit. I have tried to school myself into an
appreciative frame of mind. I have found it hard. Every day I
have thought 'To-morrow will be easier,' and when to-morrow came
I was always disappointed. Sybil, it is difficult indeed to live
when the whole flavor of life has gone from the cup."</p>

<p>She closed her eyes for a moment.</p>

<p>"But you are back again," she said softly. "I think that your
going away for so long was a mistake. In my heart I feel that it
was a mistake. So little makes such a difference. Just to have
you sit here with me and talk is such a joy. Are you staying in
London, Jermyn?"</p>

<p>"For some months, at any rate."</p>

<p>"I don't think that you must go so far away again," she went
on. "I can give up much but I need just a little. I need your
friendship, Jermyn. I am so lonely all my days."</p>

<p>"You have no new friends, then?"</p>

<p>"None," she answered, shaking her head a little sorrowfully.
"I do not think that any other person in the world can be so
utterly alone as I am. It is my own fault, I suppose,&mdash;a
kink in my tastes. When I am off the stage, I am in the wrong
place. I do not care for supper-parties and motor-car rides and
river picnics, with just the usual crowd of theatrical friends
and their friends and their friends' friends. They all seem to
expect just the same things out of life, to enjoy themselves in
the same manner. I hate it all, Jermyn. Sometimes I think that I
should like to have a few dull, stupid, middle-class friends,
who would ask me now and then to go and see them and talk silly
commonplaces about the stage. I should like anything rather
than&mdash;Oh, I am silly to talk like this!" she broke off.</p>

<p>"You are not silly at all," he assured her. "Don't you think
that I can appreciate what you mean?"</p>

<p>"People mean to be kind, I suppose," she continued, "and I
suppose it's our own fault but there does seem to be something
about our profession which doesn't inspire respect. The men all
talk to us in the same way and I don't like it. The worst sort
of them jostle up against one another in their eagerness to get
to know us, and the best never come near, or if they do, they
just pass on."</p>

<p>"We must try and alter that," Jermyn declared.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said, "I am going to have you and I don't want
any one else. You must tell me now about&mdash;your wife."</p>

<p>"There is so little to tell," he answered. "I have shown her
all the consideration I have found it possible to show her and
remain honest. She gives way at times to violent fits of temper,
she broods a great deal, she reads and thinks too much, smokes
too much, sits up too late. Her whole manner of life is scarcely
a healthy one."</p>

<p>Sybil raised her veil. Her large, soft eyes were fixed upon
his. Her cheeks were more than usually colorless, almost
transparent, but her delicacy seemed, if possible, only to
increase the beauty of her features.</p>

<p>"Have you had any further explanation?" she asked.</p>

<p>"We have had several&mdash;shall I call them crises?" he
replied. "So far as I am concerned, there is nothing more to
explain. I have never changed, I never shall change. She is
beginning to know it."</p>

<p>"She looks thinner," Sybil remarked.</p>

<p>"She is a very passionate woman and she does herself harm by
giving way," Jermyn said quietly. "I think myself that under
present conditions we should be much better apart. I proposed it
to her, but just at present she is unwilling."</p>

<p>Sybil sighed.</p>

<p>"It is so difficult," she murmured. "I suppose if I were
really a nice person, and my disposition were altogether good, I
should try and make you believe that there was no changing the
order of things; that she was your wife, and that, however she
became your wife, her claim was the same. What should you say to
me then, Jermyn?"</p>

<p>"I should promptly argue with you," he answered, "and I hate
arguments."</p>

<p>"It would all be so simple, in a way," Sybil went on, "if
only she did not care. She does care for you, Jermyn."</p>

<p>"I am hoping," he replied, "that it will pass."</p>

<p>"Women are less liable to that sort of thing than men," she
told him. "The woman who really cares so seldom changes."</p>

<p>With a little gesture he dismissed the subject.</p>

<p>"For my part," he declared, "I want to drop the burden of
these last few weary months. I am going to remember only that we
are together again."</p>

<p>"If you only knew what it meant to me!" she said. "Since you
left England I have not once been out to supper after the
theatre, I have neither lunched nor dined out with any man. I am
not sure now that it was not a mistake. People will say all
sorts of things."</p>

<p>"What does it matter? We are sure of ourselves. That is
enough."</p>

<p>"It isn't for myself," she sighed, "that I care one little
bit. You know that. However, we are coming much too near the
earth again when we talk about these silly problems. Am I really
going to drink champagne? I have forgotten what it tastes like.
I am going to wish you all sorts of things."</p>

<p>Gerald Lakenham strolled by, a few minutes later, with
several other immaculately dressed young men. He stopped short
when he saw Jermyn.</p>

<p>"Back again, sir?" he remarked, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>Jermyn nodded. He was glancing at the little company of
musical comedy young ladies to whom Lakenham's companions were
making their way.</p>

<p>"I got back this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Had a good time?"</p>

<p>"Very, thank you."</p>

<p>"My man Grayson wasn't such a fool, after all, was he?"
Gerald continued.</p>

<p>"He was unnecessarily secretive," Jermyn answered dryly. "If
he had treated us with a little more confidence, one could have
appreciated his efforts more."</p>

<p>Gerald hesitated for a moment.</p>

<p>"If it isn't taking a liberty," he ventured, "I have known
Miss Cluley so long by sight&mdash;it would be such an honor if
I might be presented."</p>

<p>Jermyn introduced him. The boy bent over Sybil with
admiration written in his face.</p>

<p>"Always hoped to have this pleasure, Miss Cluley," he
declared, "but, you know, you're the sort of mysterious lady of
the stage. One never sees you anywhere, or hears of you, and
lately you seem to manage, somehow, even to keep your
photographs out of the paper."</p>

<p>"You know," she laughed, "there is no such effectual
advertisement as self-effacement."</p>

<p>"But you," he replied, "are the one person in the world who
needs no advertisement of any sort. I am simply delighted to be
able to say that I have met you at last, Miss Cluley," he added.
"I am going to tell the other fellows and you'll see how jealous
they'll be!"</p>

<p>She looked across the room and up at him with twinkling
eyes.</p>

<p>"I think that your friends are amusing themselves far too
well for any sensations of that sort," she assured him.</p>

<p>He laughed a little self-consciously.</p>

<p>"They are only boys, after all," he said, fingering his tie.
"Good night, Jermyn! Good night, Miss Cluley!"</p>

<p>He passed on. Jermyn watched him with a slight frown.</p>

<p>"I am convinced that it is the beginning," Sybil remarked,
"of my downward course. I feel that I have been introduced to a
really dangerous man-about-town. What a pity that these nice
boys do such silly things!"</p>

<p>Jermyn was thoughtful for a time. He glanced around the place
and the atmosphere of it seemed somehow to depress him.</p>

<p>"Sybil," he went on suddenly, "tell me, is there any real
change, is there anything really and entirely different between
us, because&mdash;because I am married?"</p>

<p>"Why should there be?" she asked, wonderingly.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he replied. "I don't even know whether I
ought to ask you to have supper with me here alone. Look at all
these people. They all have their little arrangements. One knows
of them. In your profession it has become the custom to
recognize them, to regard them as inevitable. Will they dare to
look at you and remark that you are having supper with a married
man, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"You silly person, of course they will!" she laughed. "They
have been waiting too long to have something to say about me, to
miss this. And what does it matter? Are you a shade the better
or the worse for what people say about you?"</p>

<p>"Somehow or other," he confessed, "I always have the feeling
that one is."</p>

<p>"It's quite a new theory," she sighed. "What do you propose
doing about it? Neglecting me?"</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>"Then don't be foolish," she begged. "Be thankful that I am a
sensible person and that our friendship is a sensible and
reasonable thing. If other people misunderstand it, why should I
care? It is a small price which we must pay for a great joy. If
it were not for Mary's sake, it would even amuse me."</p>

<p>Mr. Levenden passed them with a knowing smile and bow. Some
other of Jermyn's acquaintances would have gone by without
recognition, if Jermyn had not forced it. He rose to his feet
when the time came to go, a little impatiently, yet a glance
from her, as he arranged her coat, soothed him again.</p>

<p>"To see you and be with you again, Sybil," he whispered, as
they went out, "is more wonderful, even, than I had hoped. I
feel so much younger, life seems to have become more elastic,
more possible. If only we could escape from this!"</p>

<p>He waved his hand back at the small tables with the rose-shaded
lights, the murmur of soft laughter, the generally
voluptuous air. Their little environment, pleasant enough in its
way, grated upon him for her sake. She laughed at him
bravely.</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she murmured, "so long as you are with me, so long
as I can feel for an hour or so most days that we can sit and
talk together, and that I can come to you and tell you my
thoughts and beg for your help when I am low-spirited and
miserable, then I simply don't care about anything else in the
world. You must try and feel like that, dear, too. It is the
only way. Try and remember always just what I have told you, how
much it means to me, how little I care about the other
things."</p>

<p>He passed her arm through his and they crossed the pavement
to the taxicab.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch34" id="ch34"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<p class="first">The splendor of an early spring had added
sunshine to the other glories of a prolonged London season.
While the east end was feverishly excited over the financial
inaptitudes of a radical government, the west blossomed out in a
glory of crocuses and hyacinths, whose faint, promising odor
seemed to hold all Mayfair under its spell.</p>

<p>Lady Annerley, as she chose now to be called, received her
friends in a house in Berkeley Square which had been rented for
twelve months. She gave two dinner-parties and a dance, at all
of which functions Jermyn played the part of host perfectly and
lifelessly. It was when the cards were being sent out to her
last entertainment, a reception which included her more Bohemian
friends, that Lucille at last approached the subject which had
never yet been discussed between them.</p>

<p>"I have looked through your list, Jermyn," she remarked. "I
will send cards to every one, of course. But what about Miss
Sybil Cluley?"</p>

<p>Jermyn looked across the table at his wife.</p>

<p>"Miss Cluley's name was not upon my list," he replied.</p>

<p>"So I noticed," Lucille said. "Why not? She is asked, I
presume, to a good many such gatherings, and your professional
connection with her would seem to entitle her to a card from
me."</p>

<p>"There is no question," Jermyn asserted coldly, "of her being
entitled to an invitation. I do not, however, choose to ask you
to receive Miss Cluley here as a guest."</p>

<p>Lucille laid down her pen and turned slowly round. Jermyn,
except for his hat, was dressed for the street. He had been, in
fact, on his way to the door when he had paused to answer his
wife's last question.</p>

<p>"What does that mean exactly, Jermyn?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It means," he answered calmly, "that I do not desire to
bring the woman, the only woman whom I have ever cared to think
of as my wife, into my house on the invitation of one who has
usurped her position by a trick."</p>

<p>Lucille sat quite still for a minute.</p>

<p>"You are very explicit," she murmured.</p>

<p>"I am anxious that there should be no misunderstanding."</p>

<p>"By a trick," she repeated softly to herself. "Yes, I suppose
that is what it was. Do you think I have gained much by it,
Jermyn?"</p>

<p>"You have gained all that you had a right to expect," he
declared.</p>

<p>"All that I had a right to expect! I wonder! You give me,
then, Jermyn, do you, all that a woman has a right to expect
from her husband?"</p>

<p>"Most assuredly I do not," he admitted. "On the other hand,
most marriages are arranged differently. In most marriages the
man has something to say."</p>

<p>She looked at him across the room, silently, almost
hopelessly. She had tried everything, all the arts her woman's
wit could devise, and she was a woman who knew all those arts
and was well-practiced in them. And there was nothing else,
nothing further she could do. She sat there, very slim and
elegant, beautiful in her plain, tightly fitting gown, beautiful
in a manner entirely of her own; beautiful though her cheeks
were thinner and her eyes a little sunken.</p>

<p>"You are hard, Jermyn," she said.</p>

<p>"I am what circumstances have made me," he replied. "I lived
for a good many years without thought of marriage, without care
for your sex. Then there came a time when, as I suppose you
would put it, I fell in love. No doubt I had it all the worse
because it wasn't an every-day occurrence with me. What I felt
for Sybil Cluley in those days, I feel now and shall feel
forever. Is not this sufficient answer when you speak of my
attitude towards you?"</p>

<p>She shivered a little and turned back to her writing.</p>

<p>"It is a sufficient answer," she assented.</p>

<p>That night there were many people who made remarks about
Lucille. She and Jermyn were present at a dinner-party given by
the Duchess of Rochester, who was a very great person indeed.
Lucille wore black, a wonderful and rather daring dress, against
which the pallor of her cheeks and the scarlet of her lips
seemed curiously emphasized. Lady Florence could not make up her
mind about her friend.</p>

<p>"I cannot feel altogether satisfied," she told her neighbor
at dinner, "about Lucille. Is she improved by her marriage or
isn't she? Is she marvelously happy or desperately miserable?
Look at her. To me she seems more beautiful than ever before in
her life, and yet there is something I don't like."</p>

<p>Her neighbor happened to be Sir James Bondman, Lucille's own
physician. He glanced across at her critically.</p>

<p>"To me," he remarked, "she looks as though she had had some
sort of a shock. Wasn't there a terrible tragedy at her wedding
reception? Of course there was. I so seldom read the papers or I
should not have had to ask the question," he continued,
apologetically. "There was an American, wasn't there, who shot
poor Chalmers right before her face and then confessed to that
queer murder of Lakenham. Found dead in his cell the very
morning he was to be brought up for trial?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Lady Florence agreed. "I suppose that was enough to
shatter any one's nerves. It was a terrible start for their
wedding journey. Yet, somehow or other, Lucille is just the one
woman who I should have thought would have been able to stand
it. She always seemed to me as though she had nerves of steel.
She can look on at suffering, horrible suffering, too, without
flinching, and she bears pain, when it is inevitable, with utter
indifference. Something has happened more than that, I
think."</p>

<p>"So far as her appearance goes, I can only make one remark,"
the physician declared. "I have known her intimately all her
life. I have always considered her attractive, but I must
confess that she has never made the impression upon me that she
makes at this moment. This evening I consider her the most
individual and the most strikingly beautiful woman in the
room&mdash;with the one nameless and inevitable exception," he
added, with a little bow.</p>

<p>Lady Florence nodded.</p>

<p>"I see what you mean," she admitted. "But tell me, from what
does this new attractiveness come? Something, I believe, has
happened upon which Lucille hadn't counted. Her mouth and eyes
have altered. I don't believe she could stroll through the
accident ward of a hospital now as I have seen her do a year or
two ago."</p>

<p>Sir James sighed.</p>

<p>"If I have an opportunity," he said, "I shall talk to her
this evening, after dinner."</p>

<p>Jermyn escorted his wife home that night after the
dinner-party. Contrary to his custom, he entered the house with her,
although he turned at once towards his study.</p>

<p>"You are not going to the club, then?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Not to-night," he replied. "I have a little work to do
here."</p>

<p>She followed him, after a moment's hesitation, into his
study. He went over to his desk. Then, glancing around, he saw
her in the room. His eyebrows were slightly lifted.</p>

<p>"You will excuse me," he remarked, drawing some proof sheets
towards him.</p>

<p>"Jermyn!"</p>

<p>He turned round once more, this time a little startled. Her
cry had rung out, shrill and vibrant&mdash;the cry of a woman in
torture. She stood looking at him from back among the shadows of
the room, which was lit only by the green-shaded lamp upon his
desk. There was something spectral about her appearance.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>His monosyllable seemed only to lash the passion which she
barely kept in check.</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she cried, "you are treating me hate fully,
hideously! You are torturing me! My God, haven't you any heart
at all? Are you going to keep me suffering like this until the
end?"</p>

<p>"Why should you suffer?" he asked calmly.</p>

<p>"Why should I suffer!" she repeated. "Don't turn away. Sit as
you're sitting now. Look at me. We've known one another for a
good many years. Do you think that it was for nothing I lied? Do
you think that it was for nothing that I told you that hateful
story? Do you suppose I didn't go through Hell before I made up
my mind that it was the only way?"</p>

<p>"I am not able," Jermyn said, "to follow the intricacies of
your reasoning. I cannot conceive of any woman fashioning so
devilish a scheme."</p>

<p>She came just a little nearer to him. It was as though he was
a magnet which drew her. She seemed to be keeping away with
difficulty.</p>

<p>"Jermyn," she exclaimed, "sometimes I think that you must be
a creature from some impossible world! You don't
understand&mdash;you&mdash;a writer! You've written of things,
you've felt things. What did I do it for? What did I run that
risk for? Not for your name&mdash;my own is better. Not for your
money&mdash;I have more than you. Not for your title&mdash;I
could use a greater than yours, if I chose. Jermyn, you know
that I love you&mdash;you know that I have loved you
always!"</p>

<p>"I do not know that," he declared. "I have never known
it."</p>

<p>"You were a fool!" she cried. "You were a fool not to see and
know! It is because you keep your head in the clouds, it is
because you are always thinking and preaching that men and women
are strong enough and fine enough to live among the mountains
and never come down to earth. We aren't; we weren't made like
it. I love you as a real, human woman loves and worships the
only man on earth for her. Nothing changes me. I suffered
agonies at Annerley, but those agonies were nothing to what I
have suffered since you and I left England together, six months
ago."</p>

<p>"Are you reproaching me with anything?" he asked, coldly.</p>

<p>"My God, yes!" she shrieked. "I am reproaching you! You are
treating me brutally just to gratify your own lust for revenge.
I am your wife, Jermyn. You can't escape from it. You are
married to me. Read the service. You heard it, every word. Think
what our life has been! You have kept me away with both arms,
me, who have been thirsting for a single word of kindness from
your lips, a single kiss, a fugitive caress, even the touch of
your arms. You could feed me on trifles, Jermyn. I'd pick up the
merest scraps of affection and grovel for more. But you&mdash;I
can't bear it any longer! Oh, I can't bear it!"</p>

<p>She suddenly collapsed. She lay face downwards on the sofa
near where she had been standing. Her long, slim body was
convulsed with sobs. She shook from head to foot, her hands beat
the cushions. Jermyn sat and looked at her. His expression was
simply faintly softened by a pity entirely impersonal.
Nevertheless, he rose to his feet and came and stood over
her.</p>

<p>"Lucille," he said, "I am sorry. I had hoped that you would
recognize the situation. It is not my fault that I married
you&mdash;you know that. Therefore, what do I owe you? You keep
me here by your side but you can't expect to buy those things
from me which a man can honorably give only when he loves. I
have nothing of that sort to give you, Lucille."</p>

<p>She grew gradually calmer. When she got up, he was for a
moment startled by her appearance. He would, indeed, have led
her to the door but she ran away from him like some frightened
animal.</p>

<p>"Don't! Don't touch me," she moaned, "not just now! I can't
bear it! I suppose I am hysterical tonight. Don't come near me,
Jermyn. Go back to your place. Don't! Don't! Don't!"</p>

<p>She half ran out of the room, her shoulders bent, a strange
limpness about her. She seemed suddenly to have lost carriage,
grace and life itself. The door closed. Jermyn went slowly back
to his seat. He turned the lamp a little higher. He looked down
at the proof sheets before him&mdash;he saw nothing. It seemed
to him that the room was full of voices&mdash;ghostly, plaintive
voices. He heard them on every side, curiously thrilling in
their unearthly note of despair:</p>

<p>"Don't! Don't! Don't!"</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch35" id="ch35"></a>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<p class="first">Sybil remained an enigma to the gossips of
stageland. She was gentle and courteous to her old friends, but
her avoidance of new acquaintances was marked and definite.
Jermyn was the only man with whom she was ever seen, and Jermyn
was scarcely the sort of person to be lightly accused of a
liaison. Mr. Levenden took a fatherly interest in her and his
wife did all she could to bring Sybil more into their little
world.</p>

<p>"What you want, my dear," she decided one day, "is a
chaperon. Every young girl of your position and appearance,
living alone, should certainly have a chaperon."</p>

<p>"Should they?" Sybil answered quietly. "Well, I never feel
that I need one. I don't see what I owe to public opinion that I
should bore myself with an old lady and pay her for boring
me."</p>

<p>"But, my dear, it's so very unconventional," the manager's
wife persisted. "Even Miss Cartnell has one&mdash;in fact they
all do."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," Sybil remarked, "they need them. If the stories
one hears about Miss Cartnell are half of them true, she
certainly does. For my part, I go about so little that it would
seem absurd for me to saddle myself with such an incubus. One's
work doesn't finish in the theatre, you know, Mrs. Levenden,"
she continued. "I often spend an afternoon thinking over my
part, and I read all the plays which are sent to me. That takes
a good deal of time."</p>

<p>Mrs. Levenden shook her head.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said, "it isn't natural at your age. You ought
to be going about with other young people, and enjoying
yourself. That's the way to keep young. Why, you'll be a little
old maid in no time."</p>

<p>"That doesn't terrify me in the least," Sybil assured her,
smiling. "I don't at all believe that old maids have such a very
bad time not the sort of old maid I fancy myself as being."</p>

<p>"All the same, it isn't natural," Mrs. Levenden persisted.
"Except for&mdash;forgive me, dear, for mentioning his name,
won't you?&mdash;Sir Jermyn Annerley, you are never seen out
with any one at all."</p>

<p>"There is no one else," Sybil replied, "whom I care to be
seen out with. Sir Jermyn is always interesting. We have our
work to talk about, and many other things."</p>

<p>"But bless the girl," Mrs. Levenden exclaimed, "it isn't a
good thing to be seen out with no one except one man! There's
safety in numbers, you know. Come and spend the week-end with
us&mdash;this week-end, now. Harry has some young men coming
down and we'll stir things up."</p>

<p>Sybil laughed and shook her head.</p>

<p>"I know your parties are delightful," she said, "but they are
not for me."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Sybil thought of her friend's advice that
morning when she took her usual walk in the Park. Although she
would never have confessed it to Jermyn, in those days she was
very conscious of missing the great things of life. The very
brilliancy of the season, the perfume and color of the flowers,
the soft blue sky, the sunshine and the mild west wind, all
seemed charged to her sometimes with a sort of delicate mockery:
a spurious, fantastic invitation towards the delights of a life
whose gates were closed to her. She watched the faces of the
young girls whom she met, so many of them with young men of
their own age. Were these things indeed passing her by? She was
exactly in this mood, standing on the edge of the curbstone,
preparing to cross the road, when a great motor-car drew up
almost beside her, and a young man leaned from his place at the
driving wheel towards her, with uplifted hat.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Miss Cluley."</p>

<p>She recognized him at once, although the very thought of his
name gave her a faint shiver. It was Gerald Lakenham. He looked
at her a little eagerly.</p>

<p>"I wondered," he said diffidently, "seeing you alone, Miss
Cluley, I wondered whether I couldn't tempt you for just a short
spin? I've got a new car a perfect beauty. She goes&mdash;well,
just get in and let me put her on fourth speed down the
Bayswater Road. Do!"</p>

<p>Sybil hesitated only for a moment. Afterwards, it seemed
amazing to her that she should have consented.</p>

<p>"I'll come," she decided. "I think I should love it. The car
does look a beauty."</p>

<p>The boy's face was flushed with pleasure. He handed her in,
and the chauffeur left his side and entered the tonneau.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't rather be behind, would you?" he inquired, a
little doubtfully. "I don't think it's half such fun myself.
There's a wind shield and you haven't a very large hat, have
you?"</p>

<p>"I am sure that I shall like it better here," she
declared.</p>

<p>The great car glided off, took its place among the line of
other vehicles, and shot out into the Bayswater Road like a live
thing. Sybil, after a moment's nervousness, began to feel the
exhilaration of it.</p>

<p>"What time have you to be back?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"Any reasonable time," she answered. "It's about eleven now,
isn't it? I like to have lunch about one."</p>

<p>"Good!" he exclaimed. "Two hours! Why, we can scour the
country. Would you care for another rug?"</p>

<p>"I am perfectly comfortable," she assured him, leaning back,
"and perfectly happy."</p>

<p>They passed a little tediously out of the suburbs into the
country. Then Gerald turned southwards and they came to a region
of curving lanes, lanes whose hedges were wreathed with dog-roses
and honeysuckle, lanes which divided meadows in which
larks were singing, meadows starred with yellow buttercups. The
sky was bluer than ever that morning, the wind softer. Sybil sat
most of the time with half-closed eyes.</p>

<p>"Please don't think that you must talk to me," she begged,
after he had made several attempts at spasmodic conversation. "I
know quite well that one ought not to speak to any one driving a
big car. Believe me, I just like to sit back and look out into
the country and breathe this air. It's wonderful."</p>

<p>"And doesn't she rip!" Gerald exclaimed, enthusiastically.
"Never changed speeds since we turned into the Bayswater Road,
and that last hill was a bit of a corker with the pull up for
those wagons. Look at her now, just with a touch. It's all on
the throttle. Why, I believe I could get her to sixty-eight
miles an hour."</p>

<p>"Don't try, please!" she laughed. "I like this smooth gliding
along."</p>

<p>"We are not exactly crawling, you know," he reminded her. "We
are doing an easy thirty."</p>

<p>"Then please don't do any more," she begged.</p>

<p>They passed across a great common, where the gorse bushes
were breaking into yellow blossom and the young bracken was
shooting up, a new and wonderful green. In the distance a lake
shone like a mirror; in the background the woods rolled away to
the horizon. Sybil's enjoyment was complete. Her companion
obeyed her bidding literally. He devoted his whole attention to
the car, and the few remarks he made were entirely concerned
with their progress. When at last they found themselves once
more in the streets of London, Sybil sat up with a little sigh
of regret.</p>

<p>"Where shall I put you down?" he asked. "Where do you live?
I'll take you all the way&mdash;I'd like to."</p>

<p>"Burley Court," she told him. "We are going into London that
side, aren't we?"</p>

<p>He assented. He was suddenly a little shy again.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he began, after a few moments' hesitation,
"wouldn't you come and have lunch with me somewhere?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Do you know, I hate restaurants," she remarked simply. "I
never go out at all. I am afraid you will think I'm a terribly
old-fashioned frump, but I love to have just a cutlet and one
glass of claret in my sitting-room, with the paper propped up in
front of me, and then lie on the couch and smoke a cigarette
afterwards."</p>

<p>He was obviously disappointed.</p>

<p>"I know you don't often go anywhere," he said. "I've never
seen you in a restaurant in my life except with old Jermyn. I
thought this morning, though," he went on, "the air and all that
might have given you a little better appetite and you might have
felt like a change. You don't think it's cheek, my asking, do
you?"</p>

<p>She looked at him for a moment and hesitated. After all, she
knew without any conceit that her coming would give him
pleasure, and her morning had certainly been delightful.</p>

<p>"Well, I will change my mind just this once, if I may," she
declared, smiling. "I will come and lunch with you, if you like,
only you must take me home almost directly afterwards. I have a
new understudy, and she is coming to talk with me this
afternoon."</p>

<p>"Hooray!" Gerald exclaimed. "That's fine! Now I wonder where
you'd like to go&mdash;whether you'd prefer a grill-room, I
mean, or a swagger restaurant."</p>

<p>"Grill-room, by all means," she begged. "I am not in the
least prepared for anywhere smart."</p>

<p>"We'll go to the <i>Carlton</i> grill-room," he declared. "I
can always get a table there and the food's topping."</p>

<p>"The <i>Carlton</i> grill-room will do very nicely," she
assured him.</p>

<p>The traffic became thicker and there was very little more
opportunity for conversation before they descended in Pall Mall.
Freed from the responsibility of his car, her companion became
pleasantly loquacious. He secured his table from the chief
<i>mantre d'httel</i>, and with an air of conscious pride
followed Sybil through the room. During their meal he talked
pleasantly of himself and his doings. Sybil was a good listener
and she was always amused. After all, he was rather an
interesting study&mdash;a young man barely twenty-four years
old, just come into his title, with enormous wealth and
everything in life before him. One could scarcely fail to be
interested at the way his ideas shaped themselves, and there was
a certain fascination in the perfectly natural manner in which
he chattered of his responsibilities, his pleasures and his
hopes. When he left her, shortly before three o'clock, at the
door of the building in which her flat was situated, Sybil felt
really grateful to him. Somehow or other, he seemed to have
brought her, for a little time, more in touch with the world in
which it seemed her natural heritage to belong, the world which
was at once so joyful and almost obtrusively gay, and from which
she had sometimes, in her moments of depression, fancied herself
banished forever.</p>

<p>"Will you come again one morning?" he begged.</p>

<p>"I'd love to," she answered, honestly.</p>

<p>"Then I shall telephone, or write and ask you," he said.
"Don't bother to answer, if you can't come, and don't bother to
come if you've anything else you want to do. Just wait until I
hit upon the right moment. Or if you ever have a headache and
feel like it yourself," he went on eagerly, "just ring me
up&mdash;I'll send you the number&mdash;and I'll be down as soon
as the car can bring me, whatever I'm doing."</p>

<p>She laughed as she gave him her hand.</p>

<p>"You are very nice," she declared. "I'll come, with pleasure,
and before long, too."</p>

<p>She waved her hand to him as he drove away. Some how or
other, the lift seemed a little smaller than usual, and a little
slower, the air of the place gloomier, her little flat more
unoccupied and emptier. She took off her hat and jacket and
looked at herself in the glass. Yes, there were wrinkles under
her eyes, a blue vein was already beginning to show at her
temple. She began to question herself almost passionately. Was
she really wise in letting life slip by her, in nursing forever
her hopeless love? And then she smiled a little sadly at the
sheer inutility of the question. In her heart she knew that as
long as she lived there could be no other man in her life save
one...</p>

<p>Gerald went joyously round to his club, and almost the first
person he saw was Jermyn.</p>

<p>"Hullo, sir!" he exclaimed, cheerfully. "Do you know whom
I've taken for a drive in my new car this morning?"</p>

<p>"I am quite sure," Jermyn replied, "that the circle of your
acquaintances is far too wide for me to make any reasonable
guess. Unless," he added, his tone growing a trifle colder, "you
have been round to see Lucille?"</p>

<p>Gerald shook his head.</p>

<p>"I was driving in the Park, trying my new <i>Daimler</i>," he
explained, "and I saw Miss Cluley standing on the pavement. It
was just an impulse but it seemed to me that she looked a little
lonely. I stopped and asked her to come for a ride and she said
yes at once. We went right down into the country for two hours
and I've just given her some lunch at the <i>Carlton</i>
grill-room."</p>

<p>Jermyn was silent for a moment. Always rather a keen and
conscientious analyst of any unusual emotion, he was absolutely
unable to account for the curious depression which suddenly
crept in upon him. It was a natural incident, absolutely
natural. In his heart he knew that he ought to be glad that
Sybil had had a pleasant morning, and yet he hated it. The boy
was nearly of her own age, a part of the life which she should
be leading. He realized, too, the utter absurdity of it, and yet
the thought that she had been seen driving with Gerald alone,
had lunched with him alone, irritated him unreasonably. He had
expected too much of her. Was this the beginning of the end?</p>

<p>"I am sure Miss Cluley appreciated it," he said quietly. "She
loves the country."</p>

<p>"Isn't she a ripper!" Gerald exclaimed, enthusiastically. "I
never met any one so charming and so easy to talk to. I don't
wonder at your liking to write plays for her, sir," he went on.
"I only jolly well wish I could. Hullo, Sammy!"</p>

<p>Gerald passed on to join one of his boon companions. Jermyn
went out into the streets, very quiet and a little thoughtful.
He suddenly felt older, a generation removed. Perhaps, even, the
respectful "sir" with which the boy had addressed him&mdash;the
hallmark of his seniority&mdash;irritated. He had left the club,
meaning to go around and see Sybil. Even after he had called a
taxicab, however, he hesitated. Something told him that it was
better for him to keep away.</p>

<p>"Where to, sir?" the man asked.</p>

<p>"Berkeley Square," Jermyn replied.</p>

<p>They started off and turned into St. James's Street. Jermyn
put his head out of the window.</p>

<p>"Go to Burley Court," he ordered.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch36" id="ch36"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

<p class="first">Sybil, standing on the hearthrug of her little
sitting-room, was declaiming one or two of the lines in her part
concerning which there had been a slight difference of opinion,
to the young lady who had recently been promoted to be her
understudy. She welcomed Jermyn with her usual smile, but his
nerves were already a little on edge and he fancied that there
was a certain amount of surprise in her greeting.</p>

<p>"You have arrived just in time," she assured him. "Let me
present you to the author, Miss Sinclair&mdash;Sir Jermyn
Annerley, Miss Sinclair. I am trying to explain some of the
passages at the end of the second act to my new understudy. Now
you are here, you can sit down in that easy-chair and help
us."</p>

<p>"It's a wonderful part," Miss Sinclair declared, "but I hope
I never have to play it. Too subtle for me, I am sure. I can't
think how you could have thought out such a character as Nora,
Sir Jermyn. You must have had a tremendous experience of our
sex."</p>

<p>He smiled a little curiously.</p>

<p>"I am not sure," he replied, "that a tremendous experience
was necessary. Nora is only an average woman."</p>

<p>"It is the average woman," Miss Sinclair insisted, "who is
always incomprehensible. I do flatter myself that I can
generally tell what a man is going to do or say when he's in a
certain position. With a woman, even one's dearest friend, one
can never be quite sure."</p>

<p>"When you two have quite finished exchanging
subtleties&mdash;" Sybil put in gently. "Are you ready now? Read
those last two speeches again, then, please, Miss Sinclair."</p>

<p>Jermyn leaned back in his chair and listened. Sometimes he
listened, sometimes he watched Sybil. She was at all times too
entirely natural to be in the least embarrassed by his presence
and she devoted herself to her task with a devotion which,
considering that it was entirely a labor of love, very much
impressed him. Later on, when they were alone, he remarked upon
it. She laughed as she sank on to a footstool at his feet.</p>

<p>"Isn't it your play, dear? I should hate to think, if
anything happened to me so that I was out of the cast even for a
few nights, that the performance would suffer too much."</p>

<p>"You are the play," he declared.</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" she laughed. "You mustn't flatter me. Now tell me
why you came this afternoon with a face like a thunder-cloud? It
has cleared off a little but something has annoyed you, hasn't
it?"</p>

<p>He hesitated. The last few minutes had been full of
reflections, inspired by the delicate atmosphere which Sybil
seemed always to create around her. The simple flowers and
adornments of her room, her unselfish cordiality to the girl who
had just left, the frank, sweet pleasure which shone out of her
eyes at his coming, all seemed like mute reproofs to his
irritable and disturbed state of mind. He hesitated, uncertain
how even to hint at his thoughts.</p>

<p>"The thunder-cloud has passed," he said, taking her hand
between his. "You have charmed it away."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless?" she persisted.</p>

<p>"I saw young Gerald at the club. He annoyed me."</p>

<p>"But why?" she asked, with lifted eyebrows. "He has been so
charming to me this morning. Didn't he tell you?"</p>

<p>"He did," Jermyn admitted grimly. "The young cub was
chock-full of conceit. I could have kicked him!"</p>

<p>She looked into his face, for a moment, genuinely
puzzled.</p>

<p>"You didn't mind my going?"</p>

<p>"I did," he assured her. "I hated it."</p>

<p>The tiny little lines at the corners of her eyes deepened.
She began to laugh, with her eyes at first and then her lips.
When she had finished, she sat on the ground at his feet and
wiped the tears away.</p>

<p>"I believe you were jealous, Jermyn!" she declared.</p>

<p>The puerility of his emotion confronted him now, unexcused
and naked.</p>

<p>"I was jealous in the meanest possible way," he
confessed.</p>

<p>"Gerald is playing around town like other boys of his age and
temperament, and I hated to have you seen with him."</p>

<p>"But that is so simple, then, dear," she told him softly. "I
will not go out with him again, if I can avoid it without
hurting his feelings. It was only a moment's
indecision&mdash;and he was just as kind and delightful as could
be. Now I know how you feel, it is different, of course."</p>

<p>Jermyn rose suddenly to his feet. Her answer had completed
his humiliation.</p>

<p>"Sybil!" he exclaimed hoarsely. "Sybil!"</p>

<p>Looking up into his face, she saw the change. Her knees began
to tremble. She rose slowly. Her eyes were still fixed upon his,
but she said nothing. He caught her suddenly by the wrists.</p>

<p>"It is intolerable!" he cried. "Intolerable!"</p>

<p>Her eyes alone questioned him.</p>

<p>"I am like a clog upon your life," he continued fiercely. "I
receive everything, I give nothing. Don't you know, child, that
you are young and life is beautiful? Can't you hear it knocking
at the doors of your heart? Didn't you feel it just a
little&mdash;today?"</p>

<p>"I feel nothing," she answered, looking at him with shining
eyes, "except when I am with you. The rest of the days may go as
they please. They do not count. They do not belong to my life.
The calendar of my days consists only of the days when we are
together. You call yourself a clog! You foolish, foolish person!
Do I need to tell you that I would sooner have you and not have
you; I would sooner be as we are now and remain always just what
we are to one another at this moment, than have all the boys in
London crazy to marry me?"</p>

<p>He stood and looked at her&mdash;realizing. He felt suddenly
humbled and yet enriched. It was the world's greatest gift which
she was offering to him, the love which comes without
bargaining, without the artificial stimulus of passion, the love
which only woman can conceive in its highest form. Jermyn felt
in those moments a deep humility. The slight conceit engendered
by the aesthetic and purposeful exclusiveness of his life served
him no longer any useful purpose. From the lips of this little
actress, whose birth was middle-class and whose education had
been scanty, who had been adrift upon the world at the age when
most girls go to finishing schools, he received the lesson of
his life.</p>

<p>"I am not worthy, Sybil dear&mdash;no one could be worthy,"
he murmured.</p>

<p>The conventions which&mdash;it must be admitted, chiefly for
her sake&mdash;Jermyn had hitherto made some effort to observe
with regard to his association with Sybil, he from that moment
ignored. They had tea together in St. James's Street and
strolled afterwards along Bond Street, looking in the shop
windows, making even a few purchases. They were laughing
together and disputing over the possession of a parcel, when
Lucille passed them. She was in her landaulette and they were
walking, but she was near enough to see the smile upon Jermyn's
lips, to notice a new spring in his bearing, as he walked
alertly along. People turned to look at them, too. They were
rather a distinguished couple the prettiest woman on the stage
and the most brilliant writer of plays. It was a significant
companionship. Lucille was swept slowly by. Her cheeks were
almost ashen; her hand had stolen involuntarily to her side. She
smiled at some friends who passed by, but there was something
ghastly about the parting of her lips. She felt that that little
picture in Bond Street on this sunny afternoon was,
notwithstanding its torture, indelible. It was before her all
the time; it would be before her always.</p>

<p>She pulled the check-string presently and ordered her
chauffeur to drive to Harley Street. Sir James Bondman was in
the act of stepping into his brougham when he saw her alight. He
hastened to greet her upon the pavement.</p>

<p>"You can spare me a few minutes professionally?" she
inquired.</p>

<p>"With all the pleasure in the world, my dear lady," he
replied, reopening the door through which he had just come. "My
work for the day is over. To tell you the truth, a fit of
idleness was upon me and I was on my way round to the club to
get a rubber of bridge."</p>

<p>He led the way into his sanctum, a comfortable if somewhat
gloomy apartment, and wheeled up an easy-chair for his visitor.
Then he seated himself before his desk and watched her for a
moment through half-closed eyes.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you?" he asked simply.</p>

<p>"Examine me," she answered. "I am ill."</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me your symptoms?" he said, taking up his
stethoscope.</p>

<p>"I have no symptoms," she replied, looking at him with
burning eyes. "Nevertheless, I am ill."</p>

<p>He examined her thoroughly. She endured everything without
either impatience or anxiety. When he had finished, and the maid
whom he had summoned to assist her with her toilette had
disappeared, she turned towards him feverishly.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing whatever the matter with you," he told
her.</p>

<p>"You mean that I am sound everywhere?"</p>

<p>"Organically, you are entirely sound. Your nerves are
disturbed. I could give you some medicine; I would rather
not."</p>

<p>She brooded for a brief space of time.</p>

<p>"I am twenty-eight years old," she remarked. "You mean, then,
that I may possibly live for another twenty or thirty
years?"</p>

<p>"Not possibly&mdash;almost certainly."</p>

<p>She rose to her feet a few moments later.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my friend," she said, a little wearily. "You have
told me what I wanted to know."</p>

<p>He led her towards the door. On the way he slipped his arm
through hers.</p>

<p>"Lucille," he said, "do you want some real old-fashioned
practitioner's advice&mdash;perfectly sound, mind, perfectly
sound, and in your case absolutely true?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do," she assured him.</p>

<p>"How long have you been married?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nearly seven months," she replied. "Why?"</p>

<p>He whispered for a moment in her ear. She stopped short. The
color burned in her cheeks and then streamed slowly away. She
faltered. The physician watched her gravely.</p>

<p>"Ah, you fashionable ladies!" he murmured, as he threw open
the door. "You make our profession prosperous by your whims. I
think I shall send you a tonic, all the same. You needn't take
it unless you like."</p>

<p>"Do!" she begged. "I haven't tasted medicine for years.
Good-by, and thanks ever so much."</p>

<p>She smiled at him from the corner of her landaulette, and was
whirled away. Sir James, who was a methodical man, returned to
his study, took out his tablets, and wrote on the space devoted
to the following day:</p>

<p>"To see Jermyn. Ask lunch, if possible."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch37" id="ch37"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>

<p class="first">Three times was Sybil called before the curtain
at the end of the second act. The enthusiasm, indeed, instead of
waning seemed rather to increase, night by night. Sir James'
companion glanced towards him in triumph.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked.</p>

<p>The physician was quiet but sincere in his reply.</p>

<p>"I am surprised," he confessed. "Miss Cluley is a revelation
to me in more ways than one. Let us smoke a cigarette
outside."</p>

<p>They passed out with the throng. Sir James excused himself
and buttonholed the manager, who was a patient and an old
acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Mr. Levenden," he declared, "I am charmed with your play. I
find, too, that you are entirely right in what you told me about
Miss Cluley. It would give me the greatest pleasure to present
to her my congratulations in person. I wonder whether it would
be possible for you to obtain an introduction for me?"</p>

<p>Mr. Levenden was somewhat flattered.</p>

<p>"I cannot absolutely promise, Sir James," he answered, "as
Miss Cluley makes it a rule never to receive any one in her
room. I feel, however, that if ever there was a case in which an
exception was possible, it is yours. If you will come round with
me now behind, she has a wait of nearly half an hour. I will
send a message into her room. This way, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>A message was sent in to Miss Cluley and in a moment or two
the reply came&mdash;Miss Cluley would be very glad indeed to
receive Sir James Bondman for a few minutes. Mr. Levenden
himself accompanied the physician and uttered a word of
introduction. Sybil received them pleasantly but with some
slight sign of surprise. As soon as the manager had departed,
Sir James abandoned his more conventional attitude.</p>

<p>"Miss Cluley," he said, "I have come round to see you, acting
entirely upon an impulse for which I hold you, however,
responsible. It is your own words, spoken in that wonderful act
to which I have just listened, which have inspired me with
this&mdash;I fear you may call it
presumptuous&mdash;resolution."</p>

<p>She smiled at him, perplexed but gracious.</p>

<p>"Pray say just whatever you like, Sir James," she invited.
"You really needed no introduction to me. I have heard a very
dear friend of mine speak of you often."</p>

<p>"It is about that friend and his wife," Sir James continued
gravely, "that I should like, if I might, to speak to you."</p>

<p>A slight shadow crossed Sybil's face. She motioned her
visitor to a chair and changed her own place.</p>

<p>"I do not quite understand," she said, "but I am
willing&mdash;I shall be very pleased to hear anything you think
it well to say to me."</p>

<p>"I am going," he warned her, "to, be very unconventional.
When I came to the theatre this evening, I had no idea that I
should find you the sort of young lady to whom I should care to
say what I am about to say. But I flatter myself that I am a
judge of character. I believe that I am doing a wise thing in
yielding to an impulse and in seeking this interview."</p>

<p>"Of course," Sybil reminded him pleasantly, "I am finding all
this very mysterious."</p>

<p>"The mysteries will disappear very soon," Sir James went on;
"in fact I am going to speak very plainly indeed. Jermyn
Annerley is the son of my oldest friend. I brought him into the
world; I have known him all his life. Lucille, his wife, I have
known, too, since she was a baby. You can understand, therefore,
that I take an interest in them both."</p>

<p>"I can understand that," Sybil admitted. "What I cannot
understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait," the physician begged. "Miss Cluley, be patient with
me if I am clumsy. I am an old man, and such gifts as I have are
not of the tongue, and although in my profession it is supposed
to be unfashionable, I have a heart. These young people have
been married&mdash;what is it&mdash;less than a year, at any
rate. A few days ago, Lady Annerley came to me as a patient. She
came to ask only a few weary questions. I examined her. There
was nothing wrong. Yet, Miss Cluley, I am going to place my
whole professional position in your hands when I tell you the
truth&mdash;the truth which I did not tell her. Although my
actual words were true ones when I told her that there was
nothing the matter, it is, nevertheless, also true that unless
some change takes place in the manner of her life, Lucille will
not live."</p>

<p>Sybil looked across the room at him steadily. For several
moments she said nothing. In the distance they could hear the
orchestra tuning up; outside, the rumbling of feet in the
corridor, fragments of conversation, the creaking of ropes as
the scene shifters attended to their duties. But in the room
there was silence. Sybil was looking intently into the stern,
calm face of the man who had seated himself on the edge of an
easy-chair, a few feet away.</p>

<p>"You must please go on now," she said at last. "You have told
me so much&mdash;more, I should think, than you have any right
to tell me. You must tell me why you are here?"</p>

<p>"I have come to you. Miss Cluley," Sir James continued,
"because when I sat in the stalls just now and watched you, I
said to myself&mdash;'I know little of the stage, I know nothing
of the art of acting, but I believe that this woman is a real
woman and has a woman's heart, or the words which she
spoke&mdash;beautiful words they are, too&mdash;would never come
so naturally to her lips.' And then the impulse came to me to
tell her that a woman whom she knows must die of that most
impossible, most incurable thing, a broken heart,
because&mdash;because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am afraid that you must finish, Sir James," Sybil
insisted.</p>

<p>"Because her husband is either faithless to her," the
physician said firmly, "either faithless or, for some mysterious
reason, notwithstanding their recent marriage, remains her
husband in name only."</p>

<p>"Why not go to him?"</p>

<p>"It is a reasonable question. I have already made several
efforts to see Jermyn. I think that he has been out of town. I
shall see him, and very soon. I am only waiting for his return.
And then, only this afternoon, I felt that impulse to come and
look at you from the stalls. Although I am an old man and
devoted to my profession, Miss Cluley, I go sometimes into the
world. I frequent my club. I know quite well that people never
quite understood Jermyn's marriage. There are some who say now
that though he married Lucille, he loved Sybil Cluley, and they
ask themselves why."</p>

<p>"Do you know why?" Sybil asked.</p>

<p>"I do not," Sir James answered, "but I do know
this&mdash;that unless Jermyn treats his wife differently, she
will die."</p>

<p>Sybil shuddered. Her fingers played for a moment with some of
the appliances stretched out on the dressing-table by which she
was sitting.</p>

<p>"So you came to me," she said. "That seems so strange."</p>

<p>"And to me," he replied, "after I had seen you, it seemed so
natural."</p>

<p>"I will give you confidence for confidence," Sybil declared
quietly. "I will tell you a secret known only to three people in
the world. I was engaged to marry Sir Jermyn Annerley. I loved
him and he cared for me. His present wife took him from me by a
scandalous trick. Jermyn discovered it only an hour or so after
his wedding."</p>

<p>"So that is the story," the physician murmured. "You have
given me the clew now to what has puzzled me so much. I was
right, then, in my surmise. It is for your sake that Jermyn
keeps his wife at arm's length?"</p>

<p>"The wife who deceived him," Sybil interposed; "the wife who
tricked him into a marriage he never desired."</p>

<p>Sir James rose to his feet and came over to the side of the
chair where Sybil was sitting. He took her hand for a moment in
his.</p>

<p>"Dear Miss Cluley," he said, "I think now that I understand.
It is a very sad position. Lucille is breaking her heart. Jermyn
is suffering. You, too, I am sure, are suffering. Don't you
think it would be a great thing if one of you were to set the
others free?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand."</p>

<p>"Ah, but I think you must understand! Think! The key of the
whole situation is in your hands. What was it you said, set
somewhere in the midst of those wonderful sentences of yours an
hour ago? Self-sacrifice is the major note of love, around which
the women of all ages have entwined their fluttering souls.'
Send him away, Miss Cluley. In time he will be the happier for
it; you will have saved her life. Think, for a moment, what can
happen if you go on as you are going now. Think! Is there any
possible outlet? Is there any hope? Can you, when the time
comes, place your hand in Jermyn's with the ghost of his dead
wife haunting you?"</p>

<p>The call-boy's shrill voice was heard down the corridor.</p>

<p>"Curtain going up on the last act. Mr. James Rawson, Miss
Ellen Sinclair."</p>

<p>Sir James rose to his feet. Sybil shook her head.</p>

<p>"I have still a few minutes," she said. "Is this indeed an
impulse of yours, Sir James?"</p>

<p>"It is entirely an impulse," he assured her.</p>

<p>"Supposing I accept that truism of yours, supposing I admit
that self-sacrifice is the major part of love? There are two of
us women. Why should not she give him up? He belongs to me, he
loves me. He has known her all her life but never dreamed of
marrying her. He has no real love for her. Is it a good thing to
force him into the arms of a woman whom he does not love? Is
that morality?"</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear," Sir James answered, "I fear that you have come
up against the walls of something very old-fashioned, something
very primitive, but which, so far as I am concerned, I can never
lose sight of she is his wife, you are not."</p>

<p>"His wife by a trick!" Sybil cried passionately. "She stole
him&mdash;deliberately stole him! She lied!"</p>

<p>"Even then they have stood together in church, they are man
and wife," he insisted. "I know that people to-day are inclined
to think more of circumstances and less of sacraments. You will
think, of course, that I am a Philistine. I suppose I am. But
there are certain conditions of life which seem to me to belong
to the inevitable order of things. There isn't any honorable
way, there hasn't been any evolved out of the brain of man
throughout all the ages, by which a human being can rid himself
of these obligations, however they come about. She is his wife.
She can take from no other man what it is his duty to give."</p>

<p>Once more they heard the call-boy, outside the door this
time.</p>

<p>"Call for Miss Cluley."</p>

<p>She was on her feet, peering into the looking-glass. Sir
James held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Will you shake hands with me, Miss Cluley?" he begged. "I do
not ask for any answer from you; I do not ask, even, for any
expression of opinion. I only ask you just to think over what I
have said and to believe that, coming from a man who is over
seventy years of age, they come at least, these words of mine,
without impertinence. Good-by!"</p>

<p>She was busy with her make-up. She held out her hand but she
did not look from the glass. He passed quietly out to find the
manager waiting at the corner of the corridor. As they turned
away, he heard once more the thunder upon her door.</p>

<p>"Second call for Miss Cluley!"</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch38" id="ch38"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>

<p class="first">Mrs. Levenden was on the point of becoming
irritable. She remembered, however, her husband's final
injunction and she refused to discontinue her entreaties.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Sybil," she protested, "we all know, of course,
that you prefer to live an extraordinarily quiet life, but there
are just one or two occasions, as Harry was saying, when you
really owe it to the theatre to show yourself a little. This
Artist's Ball is going to be quite the biggest tiling of its
sort that has ever been attempted. We do want the
<i>Imperial</i> to be well represented. Lord Lakenham is giving
us all supper and has taken the best box in the place. He
doesn't seem to care what he does so long as you come."</p>

<p>"It gives me no pleasure to go to that sort of thing," Sybil
replied. "I am sorry but that is really the truth. I wrote and
told Lord Lakenham so this morning."</p>

<p>"It's for charity," Mrs. Levenden persisted.</p>

<p>Sybil smiled.</p>

<p>"Most of these things are. If a subscription&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Levenden made a face at her.</p>

<p>"Bother your subscriptions! You know very well that is not
what we want. Now be a dear girl and change your mind&mdash;just
for my sake and Harry's," she added.</p>

<p>"Where is the supper to be?" Sybil asked.</p>

<p>"At the <i>Milan</i>. Lord Lakenham has taken the great
centre table there and is going to have some wonderful
decorations. He has invited every one of the company, Harry and
myself, and a few more theatrical people."</p>

<p>Sybil sighed.</p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. Levenden," she begged, "please don't bother about
me. I really shan't be missed in all that company."</p>

<p>"Won't you!" Mrs. Levenden answered, gloomily. "It's just to
get you there that young Lakenham has been making all this
fuss."</p>

<p>"I have already written and told him that I cannot come,"
Sybil reminded her.</p>

<p>"Of course you have," Mrs. Levenden agreed. "Isn't that why I
am here? I never saw any one so disappointed in all my life. You
did give him a half promise, you know."</p>

<p>"I didn't know that it was going to be a big affair like
this," Sybil protested. "I hadn't any idea&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped short, the interruption which came was so sudden
and so altogether unexpected. The door of the room had been
quietly opened, unheard by either of them. Sybil's maid was
announcing a visitor.</p>

<p>"Lady Annerley!"</p>

<p>Lucille had entirely the air of a casual caller. She shook
hands with Sybil and had established herself in an easy-chair
before either of the two women had realized exactly what was
happening. Then Mrs. Levenden completed in somewhat hurried
fashion her farewells.</p>

<p>"All I can say, Sybil, is that I hope you'll think better of
it," she declared. "I shall perhaps see you at the theatre.
Harry wants me to come up, if I can, and have supper with some
people. Good-by!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Levenden departed, leaving behind her a faint atmosphere
of patchouli and powder. Sybil, who had walked with her visitor
to the door, chiefly with the object of gaining a few seconds'
time, came slowly back. Lucille waited until the door was closed
before she spoke.</p>

<p>"I imagine," she began, "that I am an unexpected
visitor."</p>

<p>"I did not expect to see you here," Sybil admitted, without
attempting to sit down, "now or at any time. I cannot imagine
why you have come. Do you mind telling me?"</p>

<p>"I have come," Lucille replied, "because I want something
from you."</p>

<p>"You want something from me?" Sybil repeated.</p>

<p>Lucille nodded. She leaned forward in her chair. She was
rather wonderfully dressed in a white velvet gown, and
notwithstanding the somewhat advanced spring, she was almost
smothered in ermine. Sybil's uncurtained room was, without
doubt, trying for her. The sunshine shone fully in upon her pale
face and thin features. Sybil was conscious of a little shock.
Though her visitor was still beautiful, there was something
almost startling in the transparency of her skin, the brilliancy
of her long, luminous eyes.</p>

<p>"I want my husband," Lucille said slowly.</p>

<p>"Your husband?"</p>

<p>"I suppose he is mine although I stole him," Lucille
continued lightly, unfastening her furs. "We can't go against
facts, can we? On paper I won; in reality, you and I both know
that I lost."</p>

<p>Sybil was beginning to tremble. Somehow or other, she felt
herself no match for this self-possessed, determined woman, who
seemed to speak so easily and without even a quiver in her tone
of this tragedy which lay between them.</p>

<p>"I don't think that I can discuss this," Sybil said. "I wish
that you had not come. I wish that you would go away."</p>

<p>"Naturally," Lucille answered, smoothly. "Ours could scarcely
be a pleasant meeting, could it? It took me a long time to make
up my mind to come. Now I am here, well, I am going through with
it."</p>

<p>"You are going through with what?" Sybil demanded.</p>

<p>"My prayer to you," Lucille told her swiftly. "Can't you see
that I have come a suppliant? I want my husband."</p>

<br>
<p>"Is he mine to give?"</p>

<p>"Entirely, if you choose. I staked a good deal on my vanity.
I thought that if I once won him nominally, I should succeed in
the rest afterwards. You see, men have rather spoiled me. I
shall never be vain again! Jermyn has broken my spirit. I have
failed. We have lived together all these months as strangers. I
have tried everything. This is the last resource. Look at
me&mdash;I am dying of it. I don't exactly ask for your pity,
but for Heaven's sake, girl, think! Won't any other man do?"</p>

<p>"How could any other man do for me?" Sybil asked. "I love
Jermyn. Why should you ask me such an abominable question? Why
not another man yourself?"</p>

<p>"Because I love him, too," Lucille replied simply.</p>

<p>"We can't both succeed&mdash;reputably. I happen to be in
possession."</p>

<p>"He was mine before you took him away," Sybil protested.</p>

<p>"I had loved him for four years," Lucille declared, "before
you came upon the scene. Never mind that. It's too absurd for us
to sit here and bandy words like two schoolgirls. I have come to
plead, not to argue. Will you make a bargain with me?"</p>

<p>"What sort of bargain could there be?"</p>

<p>"Send him away for a year or two. Go to America&mdash;I see
the papers are all talking about a wonderful offer you have had
from New York. Let me have him for three years. Three years will
soon pass. You will be on the right side of thirty then unless
the newspapers all lie about your age."</p>

<p>"Are you talking seriously?" Sybil demanded. "If so, I cannot
think how you could bring yourself to make such a preposterous
suggestion. I have not the power to send Jermyn back to you, any
more than it would be possible for you to give him up when the
three years have passed. It is absurd. You talk as though we
were living in the Fiji Islands."</p>

<br>

<p>Lucille once more leaned a little forward in her chair. Her
eyes were fixed upon Sybil's. She spoke slowly and her words
seemed somehow to have become charged with a certain mystic
quality, so that they brought with them neither offense nor
wonder.</p>

<p>"Are you Jermyn's mistress?"</p>

<p>"I am not," Sybil answered.</p>

<p>Lucille's fingers touched her throat for a moment. When she
continued, however, her voice was quite calm.</p>

<p>"Somehow, I believed that," she said. "I don't understand
it&mdash;I don't understand that sort of affection. I don't
understand what sort of a woman you can be, but I believed it.
You can never be happy, then, unless you are his wife. Why
doesn't my offer appeal to you? It seems to me to be your only
chance. In three years he shall be yours. Don't ask me
how&mdash;I promise it."</p>

<p>"You cannot promise anything of the sort," Sybil declared.
"It is an absurdity. Besides, do you think that anything in the
future could recompense for those three years? Why should I
voluntarily give up the friendship which is the only joy in my
life, a friendship which both he and I have accepted as the next
best thing? Will you tell me one single reason why I should do
this?"</p>

<p>"Because you are what I am not&mdash;good," Lucille replied
swiftly. "Oh, I am in earnest! I don't value such goodness as
yours very much because, after all, it is a matter of
temperament, but I haven't the least doubt it's there. You've
too many virtues to be ever really feminine. Look at me. I am
dying, simply because I love him uncontrollably and because he
won't touch me or look at me. The same roof shelters us at
night. For months I have not slept. He sleeps in the next room.
I hear him come to bed, I hear him get up. We sometimes lunch or
dine together, we meet on the stairs, we drive to dinner-parties
or any other sort of entertainment, and return together.
He greets me and parts from me in the same manner; his speech of
greeting or farewell is in the same tone. Try and imagine what
it is like yourself. But then you couldn't&mdash;you could never
care as I care."</p>

<p>"Do you think not?" Sybil murmured.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am wrong," Lucille continued. "Mine is the love of
the tigress. Perhaps in time I should tire of him. But while I
live&mdash;while I live it is torture! He gives me not a word,
not a look. Sometimes I have cried and sobbed all night. The
very tissues of my body are wearing away. I lie awake and I
ache, my heart aches, for the touch of his fingers, for even a
sight of him. Some days I am so weak that I can scarcely crawl
about. One would think that he could see it, that for pity's own
sake he would pretend. He never does. There's nothing so cruel
in life as the man who doesn't care can be to the woman who
does...I went to a doctor the other day. He told me that there
was nothing the matter with me. I could have laughed when I came
away!"</p>

<p>"Sir James Bondman is your doctor, is he not?" Sybil asked
quietly.</p>

<p>Lucille glanced across at her.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask that? Yes, he is my doctor. Nothing the
matter with me&mdash;that is what he said! And I know&mdash;I
know that my heart is breaking. Have you ever thought of death,
Miss Cluley? No, you needn't trouble to answer me. It doesn't
really matter. Of course you've thought of it! Only I wish I
could make you realize what a horrible dread one can feel of
death when one has never for one second been happy in lifetime.
I said just now three years. If Jermyn were mine for one week, I
could meet death more bravely. But to feel yourself growing
weaker and weaker, to feel yourself getting worn out and old,
and all the time that hunger gnawing at your
heartstrings&mdash;that's what I am going through, day by day!
There isn't any ranting Calvinist with the gift of tongues who
could picture Hell to an hysterical audience, as I am feeling
it. You see, I am not trying to excuse myself. I am not trying
to tell you that I am sorry&mdash;I don't know that I am. But I
am in such a state that I can't bear it any longer. You have a
career, you're only a child yet. This state of things can't be
the happiest for you. Give me my three years. A little suffering
won't do you any harm. It's the best way out."</p>

<p>Sybil buried her head in her hands. For a moment her
visitor's face had looked positively ghastly. Lucille was
leaning back now, as though exhausted. There was a silence,
curiously prolonged. Lucille showed no signs of impatience.
Sybil was living through a little Hell of her own. At last she
raised her head.</p>

<p>"Even if I were willing," she said slowly, "I do not see that
anything which I could do would help you. You know very well
that Jermyn is not the sort of man you can tell things to and
give him no reasons. We have made our wonderful compact. If I
were to tell him to-morrow that I desired to break it, he would
never agree; he would insist upon explanations."</p>

<p>Lucille leaned eagerly forward.</p>

<p>"You can drift away from him," she cried, speaking quickly
and in a harsh, dry tone. "You know his prejudices. You can mix
for a little time with those people he hates. Mind, you are
living an unnatural life. Let him see that you feel it. Accept
this invitation to America. Afterwards, he will understand. I
will see that he shall understand. Does this hurt? Do you hate
the thought of it? Think of what I have been through before I
came here! I have been called a proud woman. Here I am,
groveling at your feet, pleading with you. Did any woman before
ever stoop so low, I wonder? It isn't only my life; it's the
other part of myself, the part we don't understand&mdash;it's my
soul. I could die once and die quickly, as bravely as any one,
but I can't die like this, unblessed, with the great hunger in
my heart. I have a horrible feeling that I couldn't
rest&mdash;anywhere. There couldn't be a grave dug deep enough
to hold me."</p>

<p>Sybil moved suddenly to the bell. She stood there with her
finger upon it.</p>

<p>"You had better go away, please, at once," she begged. "I
daresay that I shall do as you ask. I cannot tell. I only know
that I want you to go away now. You have said everything that
could be said. If I do it&mdash;if I do it, mind&mdash;I don't
want you to come near me or to thank me. If you do&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped short. Her teeth were clenched. Sybil herself,
for a moment, had the look of a tigress in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I think that I understand," Lucille said, rising to her
feet. "In any case, you are right&mdash;I can say no more."</p>

<p>The maid had already opened the door. Lucille passed out with
a little nod. Sybil stood motionless, listening to the opening
and closing of the front door, the rattle of the lift below.
Then she turned slowly to the telephone and rang up Mrs.
Levenden's house in Hampstead.</p>

<p>"Tell Mrs. Levenden," she directed the servant who answered
it, "when she returns, that Miss Cluley has rung up. Say that
Miss Cluley has changed her mind and will be glad to go to the
ball. She will see about her costume at once."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch39" id="ch39"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>

<p class="first">Jermyn arrived at St. Pancras about eight
o'clock a few evenings later, after a week's stay in Scotland.
He drove at once to his club and stared a little blankly at the
handful of letters which the hall-porter handed him in reply to
his eager inquiry. There was not a line from Sybil. He looked
them through once more and turned somewhat aimlessly towards the
smoking-room. Coming out, he almost ran into Sir James. The
latter stopped at once.</p>

<p>"Just back from Scotland?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"This minute," Jermyn replied.</p>

<p>Sir James looked at the little pile of letters which Jermyn
was carrying.</p>

<p>"You will find two notes there from me," he remarked.</p>

<p>Jermyn glanced down at them.</p>

<p>"Nothing wrong, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all. I simply invited you to lunch. There was a
little matter I felt I should like to discuss with you."</p>

<p>"What about now?" Jermyn asked. "Have you dined yet?"</p>

<p>"Just on my way to order a sole and cutlet," Sir James
declared. "Come and join me."</p>

<p>"I'll wash my hands and be there in five minutes," Jermyn
agreed. "I had better telephone home, too."</p>

<p>"You haven't been home yet, then?"</p>

<p>Jermyn shook his head.</p>

<p>"I sent my man on with the luggage and came straight here,"
he explained. "Order something for me, will you&mdash;just the
same as you are having. I am not hungry. I have been in the
train all day."</p>

<p>He went to the telephone and made a few casual inquiries.
Lady Annerley, the servant who answered the telephone believed,
was dining out. The car was ordered for a quarter past
eight.</p>

<p>"You will let her ladyship know that I have returned," Jermyn
instructed. "I shall probably be here for some time."</p>

<p>He made his way to the dining-room and sat down to dinner
with the physician. They talked for a while on casual topics.
Then Sir James began slowly to draw near the subject which was
all the time in his mind.</p>

<p>"I went, a few nights ago, Jermyn," he said, "to the Imperial
Theatre. I knew your play was good but I didn't expect to enjoy
it so much. Not only is the play good but I tell you frankly I
think that Miss Cluley is a perfectly marvelous actress."</p>

<p>For the first time Jermyn smiled.</p>

<p>"She is quite wonderful," he admitted. "I am glad you went. I
know you're not much of a playgoer."</p>

<p>"I am not," Sir James confessed. "I used to enjoy the
old-fashioned sort of thing, but science makes so many demands upon
us, nowadays, that one has very little time of any sort for
diversion. Besides, I don't like the modern play. I am sick of
seeing everything from the French. It isn't wholesome. In fact,
there are many phases of modern life, Jermyn, which don't please
an old stager like myself. I am going to talk to you about one
for a minute or two now, if I may."</p>

<p>Jermyn looked up in some surprise.</p>

<p>"Go ahead, by all means," he said. "You provoke my
curiosity."</p>

<p>"Your wife has consulted me about her health."</p>

<p>Jermyn's face altered slightly. It was noticeable that his
expression had hardened.</p>

<p>"I have not heard that she has been unwell," he remarked.</p>

<p>"She is not unwell," his companion pronounced, bluntly. "She
is only dying."</p>

<p>Jermyn set down the glass which he had been in the act of
raising to his lips. His hands were trembling. The physician had
certainly produced his effect.</p>

<p>"Are you serious, Sir James?"</p>

<p>"Is it a matter to discuss in any other spirit? Your wife
hasn't an unsound organ in her body and yet she is dying."</p>

<p>"What is the matter with her, then?"</p>

<p>"You," the physician replied, gravely.</p>

<p>There was a brief silence. Then Jermyn laughed a little
hardly.</p>

<p>"If you were a modern practitioner, my friend," he said, "I
am afraid I should look upon this as something of a dodge."</p>

<p>"You can call it what you like," the other declared. "You
know very well that I hate all quackery and that I am not given
to sensational speeches. I am fond of you, young man, and I am
fond of your wife. I tell you frankly that there is a wasting
process going on inside Lucille, against which science is of no
avail. She is fretting herself into the grave. I had to ask her
questions. I asked them professionally and she answered
professionally, but they tell the story, you know."</p>

<p>The conversation between the two men was interrupted for a
time by the service of dinner and by the passing through the
room of some friends. It was Jermyn who recommenced it.</p>

<p>"Doctor," he said, "I have never looked upon you as given to
exaggeration, and I am not accusing you of it now, but are you
sure that you quite understand Lucille? She is very excitable
and nervous and highly strung. She came to you in one of her
moments of depression. You might very easily form an idea of her
condition which was a little misleading."</p>

<p>Sir James poured himself out a glass of wine.</p>

<p>"I brought Lucille into the world," he continued. "I attended
her throughout her girlhood. I traveled over to France to see
her when she had typhoid. I do not believe that she has ever
voluntarily consulted another doctor. She has been like one of
my own children to me. Everything that I have told you is the
truth and more than the truth. I speak, of course, in complete
ignorance of any circumstances there may be between you to
explain what, on the face of it, seems so strange. I can only
deal with facts. Lucille is dying. She will die if you do not
save her. It is my duty to tell you this."</p>

<p>Curiously enough, after the first shock, Jermyn's succeeding
impulse was one of anger.</p>

<p>"Look here, Doctor," he said, "supposing there was a cause of
offense between my wife and myself, so great that, however
strange it may seem to you, there was dishonor in my even
simulating an affection for her which I could not feel, do you
still sit there and tell me that her state of health is my
responsibility?"</p>

<p>"I am a doctor and not a philosopher," Sir James remarked,
dryly. "Honor and dishonor I do not understand&mdash;not the
modern view of them, at any rate. The position of husband and
wife has been the same since the world was made, and always will
be, although the present generation seems to do nothing but kick
at it. You may alter schools of thought, you may build up new
standards, establish new cults and new sects, but you can't do
away with the obligations of the marriage ceremony. I don't wish
to know anything more than I do know. It is my duty to point out
your responsibility, and to my thinking, at any rate, there
isn't anything in this world which could absolve you if Lucille
dies without your making an effort to save her...Shall we take
our coffee outside? I am going on to a meeting at the
hospital."</p>

<p>Jermyn waved him away.</p>

<p>"I'd rather you went," he said simply. "I want to think."</p>

<p>Sir James rose from his place and for a moment let his arm
rest upon Jermyn's shoulder.</p>

<p>"I am an old fool, I suppose," he declared, "but, Jermyn,
there's only one way out of a tangle, and there isn't any one
who can show it you so well as you can find it out for yourself,
if you'll only be honest."</p>

<p>Jermyn, a little later on, found a secluded corner in the
reading-room and threw himself into an easy-chair. A crowd of
hateful thoughts were pressing in upon him. There were things
which he was forced to admit. Since the day of his marriage, it
had been a changed Lucille who had lived like a shadow at his
side. Even as he sat there, he could think of a hundred cases of
his brutality towards her. He had told himself that he was
simply being consistent. He had promised nothing; he had nothing
to give. He followed their tour, in his thoughts, from city to
city, and back again to England. It was a changed Lucille,
indeed. He had watched her grow quieter and quieter. He
remembered his heart ached with a dull pain when he remembered
the many times when she had made those timid appeals to him; the
imploring light of her eyes, the small artifices she had used,
the half-frightened entreaties for just a little tenderness, a
word, a touch, even, of his fingers.</p>

<p>The night before he had left for Scotland&mdash;he thought of
it now almost with fear, he had lain awake in his room and he
had heard a strange sound. He had crept to the keyhole of the
communicating door, which as yet he had never unlocked, and
listened. He seemed to hear the sound now again in the silence
which reigned around him&mdash;the sound of a woman moaning and
sobbing quietly through the hours of the night!...This was a new
and a terrible thing which had come into his life, a new tragedy
which he had no idea, at the moment, how to face!</p>

<p>The time slipped away. He rose at last a little wearily and
made his way round to the theatre. The performance was just over
and he met Mr. Levenden in the passage by the door-keeper's
office. He fancied that the latter seemed none too pleased to
see him.</p>

<p>"You back, Sir Jermyn?" the manager exclaimed. "By Jove, I
wish I'd known that you were going to be in town! We've a small
supper party on to-night. Couldn't you get off home," he added,
glancing at Jermyn's attire, "and change and join us later?"</p>

<p>"Not to-night, I am afraid," Jermyn replied; "thank you all
the same. I have been traveling all day. Miss Cluley hasn't
left, I hope?"</p>

<p>"No, I think she is just prinking up," Mr. Levenden told him.
"She is supping with us."</p>

<p>Jermyn stopped short.</p>

<p>"Supping with you?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"My wife and I both think," Mr. Levenden continued, "that
Miss Cluley has been living much too secluded a life. I am
thankful to say that she is beginning to break through it just a
little. She is coming to the Artists' Ball to-morrow. Young Lord
Lakenham is giving a great supper party. A connection of yours,
by the way, isn't he, Sir Jermyn? You ought to come. A writer
ought to see all sides of life, you know."</p>

<p>Jermyn turned slowly round.</p>

<p>"If Miss Cluley is going out to supper," he said, "I won't
wait now."</p>

<p>"She'll like to see you for a moment, I expect," the manager
remarked. "Perhaps she'll be able to persuade you to join
us."</p>

<p>Jermyn hesitated. It was a queer little world which seemed
crumbling about his ears.</p>

<p>"No, I won't bother her now," he decided. "I shall see her
to-morrow, sometime."</p>

<p>Jermyn passed out, just managing to escape Gerald, who was
alighting from his car outside. He jumped into a taxi and drove
home.</p>

<p>"Your mistress in?" he inquired mechanically of Roberts, as
the latter relieved him of his hat and overcoat.</p>

<p>"Her ladyship has not been out this evening, Sir Jermyn," the
butler informed him. "She was dining at Dorington House and was
on the point of starting when she felt unwell. It was just after
you had telephoned from the club, sir. She has been alone in her
boudoir all the evening. I believe she is there now, sir."</p>

<p>Jermyn slowly ascended the stairs and knocked at the door of
the end room of Lucille's little suite. There was no answer. He
turned the handle softly and entered. Lucille was lying on a
couch in a white dressing-gown. There were some smelling salts,
the evening paper, a novel and a bowl of roses on a small table
by her side. He closed the door quietly and came further into
the room. Then he saw that she was asleep. He stood with his
feet buried in the thick fur of the white rug, looking down at
her. A curious little pain pulled at his heartstrings. He was
conscious of a new feeling with regard to her, a sense of
immense, almost infinite pity. Even in repose, her face was so
absolutely the face of a tortured woman. There were lines under
her eyes, hollows in her cheeks; her neck, too, had grown
thinner. She was beautiful still, but in a queer, unearthly sort
of fashion. Suddenly she opened her eyes and saw him. It was as
though a miracle had taken place. Her whole appearance was
transformed. Her face seemed to fill out, her eyes to soften.
She grew at once younger.</p>

<p>"Jermyn!" she cried. "You here? Has anything happened?"</p>

<p>He came and sat at the end of the sofa. Perhaps something of
that expression with which he had been gazing down upon her, had
already vanished from his face, for her first wild impulse of
joy showed signs of passing away.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," he answered. "Roberts told me just now that
you were not well and I looked in for a moment to see what was
the matter. It is nothing serious, I trust?"</p>

<p>She looked at him very wistfully for a brief space of time
before she replied.</p>

<p>"No, it is nothing serious," she assured him, with a little
sigh. "I sleep badly. Just as I was going out to-night, I felt a
trifle faint. I am weary of these dinners, Jermyn&mdash;so weary
of them. To-night I felt that I couldn't stand it. I came up
here and lay down and I must have dropped off to sleep, and when
I opened my eyes and saw you, I thought that it was a dream. You
seemed different, somehow."</p>

<p>The disappointment in her voice was pathetic. He held out his
hand and took hers. Again the light leaped up. It was the first
time he had voluntarily touched her since their marriage.</p>

<p>"I am sorry that you don't sleep," he said. "Perhaps we had
better go down to Annerley a little earlier than we had
intended. It has been a long season this year and you've been
doing a great deal."</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured, still looking at him intently. "I am
very tired of London. I am tired of doing things. I think that I
should like it at Annerley."</p>

<p>"Have you had any dinner?" he asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I am going to have some biscuits and milk. Won't you," she
added, timidly, "have a whisky-and-soda or something? Will you
touch the bell?"</p>

<p>He obeyed.</p>

<p>"I will have a whisky-and-soda here, if I may, instead of
going downstairs again," he decided.</p>

<p>"Do you know that it is the first time we have ever sat in
here together, Jermyn?" she remarked presently. "And I am not
looking a bit at my best. If only I had known that you'd been
coming!"</p>

<p>"My dear Lucille," he said, smiling, "what outrageous vanity!
You are wearing white, your best color, aren't you, and I am
sure your white silk stockings are unexceptionable. Tell me,
have you done anything amusing while I was away?"</p>

<p>"Amusing!" she repeated. "I am afraid that just now I don't
find anything in life amusing. You see, Jermyn, I have made
rather a mess of things," she went on. "We women are gamblers,
you know. I wanted one thing so much that I staked everything in
life upon it, and I lost. There doesn't seem to be anything much
left."</p>

<p>Jermyn looked away into the fire. Was this a new battle which
he was called upon to fight&mdash;a battle, too, of confused
issues? Was he losing his strength? There was certainly
something suspiciously like a lump in his throat.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to find you so depressed, Lucille," he said.
"Perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"If there is anything I could do," he concluded, a little
lamely.</p>

<p>She burst into a fit of laughter, laughter which sounded at
first genuinely mirthful but which ended in a little choke.</p>

<p>"Oh! Jermyn, Jermyn," she cried, wiping the tears from her
eyes, "bless you for that! I think that I should have had
hysterics in five minutes. That laugh has saved my life! No,
dear, there's nothing you could do, of course. What could you?
It's nice of you to come and sit with me. Come oftener, won't
you? I am still a very old-fashioned person, you know, who would
like to see just a little more of her husband."</p>

<p>She gave him her hand. He hesitated for a moment and then
raised it to his lips. It was as cold as ice. Her eyes had
fallen before his but he could see that she was shaking.</p>

<p>"I will certainly try and see something more of you," he
promised. "If you are doing nothing to-morrow, will you lunch
with me?"</p>

<p>"Of course," she replied. "It gives me just the excuse I was
longing for to throw over a terribly dull luncheon with the
Chalcotes. I can at least offer them something novel in the way
of apologies&mdash;I am engaged to lunch with my husband!
Excellent! Sleep well, Jermyn. You must be tired after your
journey. Will you send my woman along? Knock at the door on your
left as you go by."</p>

<p>Jermyn sat for some time in his own room, before the open
window. It faced eastward, and the view of the city by night,
with its gradually dying glamour of sounds, always fascinated
him. It was an hour or so later before he prepared for bed. He
heard Lucille's maid depart, after wishing her mistress good
night. Sometime afterwards he moved softly towards the
connecting door, drawn there by some strange, disturbing
apprehension which he could not altogether control. He listened
painfully, his fingers digging into his flesh. There was the
same sound, only this time so low that it was hard to
distinguish it even from where he stood the smothered sound of a
woman crying softly to herself. When he stood up at last, his
own eyes were hot. He walked back to the window. The new battle
had indeed begun!</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch40" id="ch40"></a>CHAPTER XL</h2>

<p class="first">Jermyn lunched next day with Lucille at the
<i>Ritz</i>. She was gayer and in better spirits than she had
been for some time, and she gave him a delightful account in her
perfect French of two plays which she had seen in Paris during
the last few days.</p>

<p>"Flo and I really went over to buy hats," she told him, "but
they were all hideous. The theatres, though, were wonderful.
Sometimes I think that you rather neglect Paris, Jermyn."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I do," he confessed, with real regret. "It does
seem so hard to crowd everything into life."</p>

<p>"Fortunately, life is a sort of expanding quality. It becomes
a different thing, something more or something less, for every
one of us," she remarked. "To our neighbor on the right, for
instance, it means as many lunches and dinners as he can consume
without injury to his digestion. And to&mdash;why, there's
Gerald!"</p>

<p>Jermyn's face suddenly darkened. Gerald, looking very smart
and handsome, was showing Sybil to a little table which had been
reserved for them. She saw Jermyn and for a moment she stood
still. Then she nodded brightly and took the seat with her back
towards them.</p>

<p>"Miss Cluley looks as charming as ever," Lucille declared. "I
see in the paper this morning that she is going to the Artists'
Ball to-night in the costume she wore in her first
success&mdash;'Nilitska,' the dancing girl, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"I believe so," Jermyn answered, a little absently.</p>

<p>"An excellent thing for Gerald," Lucille continued, trifling
with her salad, "to have so charming a young lady to pilot him
through the realms of Bohemia. None of these young men,
nowadays, I suppose, are content unless they are seen somewhere
with an actress, and Miss Cluley is so wonderfully
superior."</p>

<p>"Need we discuss her?" Jermyn interrupted, irritably.</p>

<p>"Why should we?" Lucille smiled. "I suppose you know that
Maeterlinck is in London? I am going to meet him this afternoon.
Will you come, or is all your time fully occupied?"</p>

<p>"I should like to come very much, if it isn't too late,"
Jermyn replied. "You are going to the professor's, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>She assented.</p>

<p>"I am going very early, as it happens," she told him. "Amy
asked me to go before the others, and you know you're always
welcome. Dear me, this place is becoming like a club!"</p>

<p>She leaned over to talk to some passers-by. Something of the
same sort happened every few minutes. On their way out, Lucille
was swept away with a crowd of acquaintances. Jermyn made his
way over to the table where Sybil and Gerald were sitting.</p>

<p>"Shall I find you at home this afternoon, Sybil?" he inquired
simply.</p>

<p>"I am afraid not," she answered. "I have promised to go for a
short motor ride with Lord Lakenham, and then I must have my
costume for the ball tried on. Tomorrow, if I still exist, or
the next day."</p>

<p>Jermyn was puzzled. She met his gaze quite frankly but there
was something different. He exchanged a few more ordinary
sentences and turned away.</p>

<p>"Why don't you come to my supper party, sir?" Gerald asked
him. "Miss Cluley is going to be our bright particular
star."</p>

<p>"I am afraid," Jermyn replied, a little hesitatingly, "that
that sort of thing is scarcely in my line."</p>

<p>"Have a try, for once," Gerald begged. "You'll find it lots
of fun. The <i>Milan</i> at twelve o'clock. They've got an
extension."</p>

<p>"Thank you," Jermyn said. "May I think it over?"</p>

<p>"You can think it over, but I shall book you," Gerald
insisted. "It's going to be one of the sights of the year."</p>

<p>Jermyn rejoined his wife, paid the visit with her which she
had suggested, and afterwards wandered restlessly back to his
club. Lucille was dining out alone that night&mdash;the date of
his return from Scotland had been uncertain and she had accepted
no invitations for him during the week. He entered the house
just as she was leaving. She paused, for a moment, in the hall,
a glittering vision of silver and gray.</p>

<p>"Paris," she remarked. "I had to go over to have it tried on.
Such a nuisance&mdash;I'm inches thinner. What do you think of
it?"</p>

<p>"Wonderful," Jermyn answered, truthfully enough. "It isn't a
dress at all&mdash;it's an inspiration."</p>

<p>"How Monsieur Charles would love you!" she sighed. "It is
almost his own remark. Personally, it makes me feel like a
mermaid. I have to feel the weight of my tiara to be quite sure
that I am properly dressed."</p>

<p>She drew her cloak around her and passed out with a little
nod. Jermyn's servant followed him upstairs.</p>

<p>"You will change now, sir," he asked, "or will you dine
first?"</p>

<p>"I will change now," Jermyn decided. "A smoking jacket will
do. I shall spend the evening at home."</p>

<p>He dined in the library, trifled with some new books, glanced
through the reviews and the evening paper, wrote a couple of
letters. Every now and then he found himself looking at the
clock. He was conscious of an acute feeling of restlessness.
There was something in his blood which he could not analyze; a
vague unfamiliar sensation which he failed altogether to trace
to its foundation. He thought continually of Sybil. There was
something new between them, some quality in her tone when she
spoke to him, something, even, in the frank way she laughed up
into his face, which baffled him. He thought of their last
parting, of the letters which he had written her. There was
nothing which could possibly be misunderstood, yet something had
happened. And all the time there was a background to his
thoughts. There was Lucille! The book which he had been reading
slipped from his fingers as he lounged in the chair, with his
eyes fixed upon the smoldering fire. He went over his
conversation with Sir James. One by one those sentences came
back to his mind, so ponderously delivered, so weighty, so
charged with an insistent, minatory meaning. Lucille's face as
he had seen her asleep, the previous evening, haunted him.
Somewhere in one of the smaller galleries of Florence he had
seen a picture of an Italian woman, a victim of the Inquisition,
lying in her cell, fresh from the torture chamber, dreaming of
the last night of terror. The memory came back to him. There was
the same expression as he had seen in the curve of Lucille's
lips&mdash;a woman in Hell! He moved restlessly in his place
and, springing up, began to walk up and down the room. It was
absurd, he told himself. His relations with these two women had
been carefully thought out, with due regard to all the
circumstances, with due regard to everything he owed them.
Lucille was paying the price of her own wickedness and
deceit...Nevertheless, the restlessness grew. He kept glancing
at the clock. At half-past eleven he could bear it no longer. He
rang the bell.</p>

<p>"Parkes," he ordered, "put out my dress clothes at once. I am
going to a dance."</p>

<p>He followed the man upstairs, presently. Just before midnight
he was in the entrance hall of the <i>Milan</i>. He arrived
there just as Gerald Lakenham drove up with Sybil by his side.
Again Jermyn felt a queer little pang as he advanced to meet
them.</p>

<p>"So you have really come!" she explained. "You astonish
me!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" he answered. "You are here. To me, you know, that
was almost as astonishing."</p>

<p>"Ah, no!" she objected. "Every one tells me that I ought to
have been doing this sort of thing for a long time. It is my
mitier to be frivolous. It is scarcely yours, is it?"</p>

<p>Gerald was busy collecting his party and for these few
minutes they were alone.</p>

<p>"Something has happened, Sybil," Jermyn said quietly.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. Her feet were keeping time to the
music. She was wearing a wonderful gown, unlike anything he had
ever seen on her before, and her maid was following behind with
a little bag containing her domino and mask.</p>

<p>"Nothing has happened, dear Jermyn," she assured him, "only I
think that I am growing to feel younger. I am afraid of gray
hairs, sitting by myself and moping all day long. Don't you
think I am wise?"</p>

<p>"But isn't it a little&mdash;sudden?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Ah! these changes are always sudden," she replied.</p>

<p>"It is a change, then?" he said swiftly. "Sybil, is anything
changed between you and me?"</p>

<p>For a moment she was her old self.</p>

<p>"Not while the world lasts, dear one," she murmured. "And
yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you will only finish your sentence," he begged, "I feel
that I shall have the answer to a little riddle which is
puzzling me sorely."</p>

<p>"My sentence," she whispered, "is better unfinished. Now here
comes everybody and I know you're going to hate it all."</p>

<p>Sybil's words were prophetic. Supper was served at a great
round table in the middle of the restaurant. Jermyn was placed
at some distance from Sybil, between Mrs. Levenden and an
exceedingly lively young woman of American extraction, who was
appearing in a popular musical comedy, and to whom he was
apparently expected to devote himself. Jermyn had never heard
the name of the show in which she was performing, and she had
never heard of Jermyn. After the first few sentences,
conversation fell flat.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a rather difficult situation for him.
Everybody called everybody else by their Christian names, and a
peculiar sort of freemasonry seemed to exist between them all
and to form the foundation for the conversation. Jermyn did his
best at first to talk to his neighbors, but he found the task
almost hopeless. They belonged to a different world and they
spoke a different tongue. Even their manners were strange to
him. As time went on, every one became riotously gay. Sybil,
between Gerald and one of his particular cronies, was altogether
the centre of attraction. Her laugh was continually heard. She
talked with every one, she even whispered sometimes to Gerald.
Gradually Jermyn began to feel as though he were a skeleton at
the feast. Mrs. Levenden, who outside her intimate knowledge of
the stage was rather a stupid woman, had given up trying to make
conversation with him. The American beauty at his right was
engaged now in a desperate flirtation with a young compatriot a
few places away. Magnum after magnum of champagne had been
opened; the table was hung with tobacco smoke. Several of the
men, and even one or two of the girls, were making quite as much
noise as was seemly. A <i>mantre d'httel</i> had brought in a
huge box of crackers, and Sybil, amidst applause, had placed
upon her head a little <i>vivandihre's</i> cap. Some one drank
her health. She stood up and kissed her hands across the table
to him. Suddenly, almost for the first time, she caught Jermyn's
eye. For a single moment it seemed to him as though a mask had
fallen from her face, as though her little glance was an
imploring one, as though she were calling to him to take her
away, that it was all a bad dream, that some evil spirit had
taken possession of her. Her message came to him with such
convincing earnestness that he rose to his feet before he could
realize what he was doing. Then, as swiftly as it had come, the
look passed away. She was once more the gayest of those present,
laughing with everybody, the presiding deity of the feast. When
at last they rose, Jermyn with difficulty made his way to her
side. Her face was a little flushed; she looked up at him, as he
came, with a quiver almost of apprehension.</p>

<p>"Sybil," he pleaded, "don't go to this dance. Let me drive
you home."</p>

<p>Again she seemed to hesitate; the mask slipped. Then Gerald
came up and swept her away.</p>

<p>"You're in box number five, sir," he told Jermyn, "with Miss
Cluley and me, but she's engaged to me for the ride down. We are
going to try my new coupi. There are plenty of cars outside, if
you haven't your own. We shall all meet in the vestibule."</p>

<p>Jermyn stood quite still and watched them pass him. He saw
Gerald hand Sybil into the little coupi, which headed the
procession of cars. She never looked back. As the coupi swept
round the courtyard, however, on its way out, he fancied that he
caught a gleam of a white face peering anxiously in his
direction. He took a quick step forward. When it passed him
again, however, his heart sank. It was surely a mask! Sybil was
leaning back among the cushions, laughing heartily.</p>

<p>One or two of the others spoke to him, pointing out the cars
which Gerald had engaged. Mrs. Levenden, indeed, seemed almost
to expect his escort. Jermyn, however, with a murmured word of
excuse, managed to escape. He made his way out into the Strand
and turned westwards.</p>

<p>Jermyn paused for a few moments on the steps of his club, but
finally made his way directly homeward. It was solitude which he
needed, solitude free from even the chance of unwelcome
interruptions. He let himself in with a latchkey and met Roberts
in the hall, carrying a small silver tray. The man came forward
to assist him.</p>

<p>"Her ladyship, sir," Roberts announced, "is not feeling very
well. I was taking her up some brandy."</p>

<p>Jermyn raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Where is her maid?"</p>

<p>"Her ladyship found that Annette was suffering from neuralgia
and sent her to bed early," the man explained. "I was just
wondering, sir, whether it would be as well to have one of the
other young women wakened."</p>

<p>"Where is her ladyship?" Jermyn asked.</p>

<p>"In her boudoir, sir," Roberts told him. "She only returned a
few minutes ago."</p>

<p>"I will see whether any assistance is necessary," Jermyn
said. "You can give me the tray."</p>

<p>Very slowly he mounted the stairs and knocked at the door of
her sitting-room. Lucille was lying upon the couch, still fully
dressed. She opened her eyes and turned her head a little
wearily, but sprang up when she saw who it was.</p>

<p>"Jermyn!" she explained.</p>

<p>He set the tray down upon the table.</p>

<p>"I saw Roberts in the hall as I came in," he remarked, a
little stiffly. "He told me that you were not feeling well and
that you had sent your maid to bed."</p>

<p>The color was gradually returning to her cheeks. She raised
herself slightly upon the couch.</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you to come and inquire," she said. "May
I have just a sip of that brandy? I am really quite all right
now, though."</p>

<p>He handed her the tumbler.</p>

<p>"I felt just a little faint when I came in," she explained.
"We played too much bridge after dinner, and the rooms were so
close. Then I remembered that I had sent Annette to bed and it
annoyed me. I am really quite all right now."</p>

<p>He stood by her side, looking down at her. She was still
wearing her wonderful gown but she had removed her jewels, which
were lying upon the table.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that you wouldn't care to have one of the
parlor-maids sent for?" he asked. "Or I daresay that Annette is
well enough to get up and help you now."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"It really isn't necessary. I shall be able to manage for
myself quite well. Sit down for a moment, won't you?"</p>

<p>She stretched out her hand and drew a low chair close to the
side of the sofa. Then she glanced up at him and their eyes
met.</p>

<p>"Please sit down," she begged.</p>

<p>He obeyed at once. She took his hand between hers.</p>

<p>"I am cold," she murmured. "I wonder why I am so cold."</p>

<p>"Finish the brandy," he advised.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders and drank it.</p>

<p>"I want to talk," she said. "I think that that will do me
good. Tell me where you have been?"</p>

<p>"To a supper party at the <i>Milan</i>."</p>

<p>"Amusing?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid I didn't find it so," he replied.</p>

<p>A queer little flicker of sympathy parted her lips. In a
sense she realized that she was responsible for his depression.
Then her thoughts wandered away again.</p>

<p>"Did you ever feel tired, too, Jermyn&mdash;so tired that
every bone in your body ached, and your heart ached, and your
eyes were hot, so hot and tired that sleep seemed an
impossibility, so tired that you hadn't even the
courage&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off abruptly in the middle of her sentence.</p>

<p>"Ah! but of course you don't feel like that," she continued,
"and I don't want you to. It's stupid of me, isn't it, to be so
dull just when you happen to have come in to see me. But I am
tired to-night&mdash;I am so tired."</p>

<p>There was something intensely pitiful in her slowly uttered
words, in the longing which she could not keep out of her face.
Jermyn felt once more that little lump in his throat. Once more
the hateful consciousness of his callous brutality seemed to
seize hold of him, to stir in his consciousness and in his heart
a multitude of surging emotions. He bent over her.</p>

<p>"Won't you let me&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped short.</p>

<p>"Won't I let you what?" she asked, a little breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Would you like me to carry you into your room?"</p>

<p>She held out her arms. Her smile was one of absolute
self-yielding yet it had in it something of her old brilliancy. He
lifted her up, amazed to find how light she was. Then he opened
the door and passed into the inner chamber for the first time
since their marriage.</p>

<p>"Put me down upon the bed, please," she begged. "I am going
to rest there for a few minutes before I undress."</p>

<p>He obeyed her but her arms still held him, although her eyes
were closed. Suddenly she opened them. Her fingers gripped his,
holding him with amazing force. There was a light in her face
unlike anything he had ever seen in his life.</p>

<p>"Jermyn!" she pleaded. "Jermyn!"</p>

<p>Her long arms were wound around him now with almost frantic
force.</p>

<p>"One word," she faltered,&mdash;"one touch!"</p>

<p>The wave of pity reached his heart. He stooped and kissed her
on the lips.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch41" id="ch41"></a>CHAPTER XLI</h2>

<p class="first">"For a two-year-older, you are much too
exhausting for a hot morning," Jermyn declared, setting down his
boy upon the stone balcony. "There, run along to nurse."</p>

<p>The child showed signs of objecting but his nurse quickly
caught him up and disappeared. Jermyn remained, for a moment,
looking out over the gardens, radiant now with all the perfumed
perfection of spring flowers and foliage. There were beds of
wonderful pink and white hyacinths, long borders of yellow
crocuses, with patches of anemones and banks of daffodils. In a
corner where the sunshine lingered longest, the early roses were
breaking into blossom, and in the distance was a delicate cloud
of pink and white blossom from the walled fruit garden. The
master of Annerley drew a little sigh of content before he
passed through the open windows into the small morning room,
where breakfast was arranged at a round table drawn up close to
the balcony.</p>

<p>"Her ladyship is not down yet?" he asked Roberts, who was
standing at the sideboard.</p>

<p>"Not yet, sir," the man replied. "The gong has gone
twice."</p>

<p>Jermyn shook out the letters from his post bag and ran them
through at first carelessly enough. Then he stopped short. Even
after three years, the sight of Sybil's handwriting was not
without its effect upon him. He glanced at the foreign postmark,
with the name of the hotel on the outside of the envelope. Then
he opened it almost eagerly and settled down to read it. It was
dated from a town in the far west of America:</p> <br>

<p class="letter"> <span class="smcap">My dear
Jermyn</span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter"> Your cables and letters of congratulation to
Mary and Gerald have been more welcome than I can ever make you
understand. They have made all the difference so far as I am
concerned, and have taken quite a load off my mind. Knowing them
both as well as I do, Jermyn, you can imagine what joy it gives
me to realize absolutely their love for one another.</p>

<p class="letter"> We seem, somehow, at the other end of the
world, but I cannot tell you how happy we all are. Gerald
especially is delightful. He and Mary insist upon taking my
whole tour with me. We have a private car and go from place to
place, and really I think we all behave like a party of
children. Gerald and Mary go sight-seeing at every opportunity
and always come back with a wonderful account of their
wanderings. I have, unfortunately, to spend a great deal of time
in the theatre, as the audiences out here like plenty of
variety, and we have to change our programme continually. I
daresay you sometimes see the papers and you know that America
has been much too kind to me. I have had heaps of offers to stay
on here&mdash;well, nearly for the rest of my natural life; or
my working life, at any rate. But we are all coming back
directly this tour is finished.</p>

<p class="letter"> I am going to write you a longer letter in a
few days. I want to write you more fully about Mary and Gerald.
I do not think that you will blame me&mdash;I don't really see
how anybody could. They are simply devoted to one another, and
it is the greatest happiness imaginable to see them together.
You know what Mary has meant to me all my life, and you can
imagine what it means now to think that my care of her is so
delightfully rewarded. I am sure that Gerald's people, however
they may feel just at first, cannot help loving her, in
time.</p>

<p class="letter"> I am writing you in great haste for this
mail, Jermyn, because half an hour ago I received a letter from
your wife which puzzled me and has made me just a little uneasy.
To explain it I must tell you something. Three years ago, in
London, she paid me a visit which I daresay she has never told
you about; there was, indeed, no necessity. You know how things
were between us then; you know how things were between you and
your wife. The situation seemed, perhaps, to us, the only
possible one. In effect, I suppose, it was terribly unnatural
and, so far as your wife was concerned, notwithstanding
everything, terribly cruel. Because, you see, she really did
care, in a different way from anything I ever imagined&mdash;in
the most wonderful way. She really came to me that day, to put
it very simply, to beg me to give you up. That was the great
text of her coming, and some of the things which seemed to me of
less account, slipped away from my mind until her letter
recalled them. She asked me, Jermyn, to give you up for three
years&mdash;to give her three years of happiness. After then,
well, she just shrugged her shoulders, and, somehow or other,
that part of what she said never seemed to me to have any great
significance. But this morning, as I have told you, I had a
letter from her. It was a very charming letter and she said many
nice things, and I know from it that my sacrifice&mdash;you see,
I am not hypocrite enough to pretend that it was not a
sacrifice&mdash;has not been in vain, and that she has been
happy. But the conclusion of her letter puzzled me. She spoke as
though some definite epoch were over, as though there were some
sort of bargain which she was preparing to keep. While I was
trying to think what she could mean, the memory of our interview
all came back and I understood. I think, Jermyn, it was on the
third day of May that she came to me. The three years would be
just about up when you receive this letter. I will not tell you
quite the thoughts which have come into my mind. They seem too
absurd to set down with pen and ink. But will you watch over her
very carefully for a little time? I have written her, also, and
I expect and hope that what I have said will be enough.</p>

<p class="letter"> Mary sends her love and Gerald his
remembrances. They are off for a three days' motor tour through
some magnificent scenery. Will you write to me through the bank
in New York? You know how glad I shall be to hear.</p>

<p class="letter">Ever yours,<br> <span
class="smcap">Sybil</span>."</p><br>

<p>Jermyn rose slowly to his feet. He glanced at the calendar
which hung on the wall. It was the morning of May 3rd! He looked
at the empty seat at his table, empty for the first time since
they had been at Annerley, and a sudden paralyzing fear kept
him, for a moment, motionless. Lucille was not like other women.
She had strange ideas. And her word&mdash;her word was more,
even, than a bond. In those few seconds during which he stood
there, gazing through her empty place with transfixed eyes, he
remembered a moment in the gardens on the previous night, a
moment when her arms had stolen around his neck with a touch of
that old feverish, terrified craving, and a shadow of
hopelessness had gleamed once more in her strangely-lit
eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah! Jermyn," she had whispered, "they have been wonderful,
these three years!"</p>

<p>Three years! The three years were up that day! Lucille had
mentioned the exact time. Jermyn left his letter lying upon his
plate, opened the door and ran upstairs swiftly. On the landing
he met Annette.</p>

<p>"Where is your mistress?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>Annette answered in an undertone.</p>

<p>"Her ladyship had no sleep last night. She is just taking a
sleeping draught and is going to lie down for a few hours. She
wished particularly not to be disturbed."</p>

<p>Jermyn almost pushed her on one side. He hurried along the
corridor and reached the door of his wife's room. He turned the
handle&mdash;it was locked. In a moment he had passed on into
his own sleeping apartment, rushed through it and tried the
handle of the connecting door. That, too, was locked.</p>

<p>"Lucille!" he called out.</p>

<p>There was no answer. He took the handle in his hand and shook
it.</p>

<p>"Lucille!" he repeated. "I must speak to you at once!"</p>

<p>Still there was no immediate answer and the sick fear was in
his heart. He stepped back, his right shoulder squared for a
charge. Then he heard his wife's voice. There seemed something
unnatural about it, it seemed to come from a long way off, but
it was her voice.</p>

<p>"What is it, Jermyn?"</p>

<p>"I must speak to you this instant," he declared hoarsely. "I
must speak to you without a second's delay. Do you hear? Open
the door, Lucille."</p>

<p>For a moment she did not reply. Then he heard the rustling of
draperies within the room. She was coming towards him. The lock
turned. He flung the door open. She stood upon the threshold,
gazing out upon him like a ghost. He sprang past her to the
middle of the room. Then he gave a great sob of relief. On her
table was a letter, written and addressed to him; by the side of
it, a wineglass&mdash;full. He caught it up in his hand and
dashed it upon the carpet. Then a sudden fit of weakness came to
him. He sank into the chair where she had been writing.</p>

<p>"Jermyn!" she cried softly. "How did you know?"</p>

<p>He sat looking at the little stream of dark brown liquid and
the fragments of the glass upon the carpet. The sight seemed to
give him confidence. He rose and held out his arms. She came to
him readily enough but her face was still very white and
strained.</p>

<p>"Dear," she faltered, "it is my word&mdash;my word of
honor."</p>

<p>He held her tightly and led her toward the window. Below, the
nurse and child were playing. She turned away with a little
shiver.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, I know!" she sobbed. "But these three years,
Jermyn! One could go down into Hell with the memory of these
three years singing in one's heart."</p>

<p>He kept his arms about her tightly. With an effort he made
his tone as matter-of-fact as possible.</p>

<p>"I think," he said, "that the best thing you can do is to
read a letter I have received this morning, and afterwards to
read another one which you will probably find for yourself in
the post bag."</p>

<p>"From&mdash;her?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Will you wait here while I fetch them?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes!" she promised.</p>

<p>He hesitated. She smiled at him very pathetically.</p>

<p>"Jermyn dear, you can't think that I wanted to do it? I shall
be very safe until you come back."</p>

<p>He went downstairs like a man in a dream and returned with
the letters. He spread his own out upon the table before her,
and, cutting the envelope of the one addressed to her, drew out
the single sheet of closely written notepaper and placed it in
her hands. She read them both, word by word. When she had
finished, she was crying softly. They sat together at the open
window. The west wind came to them from over the gardens. Every
now and then there were peals of childish laughter.</p>

<p>"But, Jermyn," she whispered, "what about her?"</p>

<p>His fingers tightened upon her hand. He, too, was looking
through the window, across the gardens, across the park, to the
sky.</p>

<p>"There are two sorts of happiness, dear," he said.</p>
