TIMOTHY RYAN</a></h2>

<p class="first">"ANY one else for the board? Last time of
asking."</p>

<p>The little company of gloriously bronzed young men and women,
lying on the two rafts moored outside the rocky Paradise of the
Cap d'Antibes' bathing enclosure, bestirred themselves lazily.
Passing at a snail's pace only a few yards away was the speed
boat they had been admiring half the morning. Ben Richmond, the
presiding genius of the place, who had been careering round the
bay for the last twenty minutes and had just slipped off the
plank, came swimming towards them with long easy strokes.</p>

<p>"Glorious, you fellows!" he exclaimed enthusiastically. "My,
that old gentleman has some engines on her. I'll swear we were
doing forty at the bends."</p>

<p>"How many times did they lose you?" a fair-haired girl
enquired.</p>

<p>"They tricked me off once," the young man confessed. "Not so
bad. The fastest aquaplaning I've ever had."</p>

<p>The elderly gentleman in smart nautical costume leaned over
the side of the launch and repeated his invitation.</p>

<p>"Any one else for the board? Last round before lunch."</p>

<p>Ned Loyd, who had been lying prone on his back, his face
upturned to the sun, rose to a sitting posture, and, all unaware
that thereby he was making history in the criminal records of the
world, held up his hand to signify his acceptance of the
invitation.</p>

<p>"Guess I'll have one turn," he decided lazily. "Makes you feel
like a porpoise lying here all the morning."</p>

<p>His sister Caroline, stretched out by his side, turned halfway
towards him. She held up her hand as though to shield her face
from the burning sunshine, but in reality to hide the faint
shadow of trouble in her eyes. She looked steadily out towards
the launch, a very magnificent affair piled with red cushions and
with all the appurtenances of nautical luxury. Two very smartly
dressed young women in bathing costumes and peignoirs were lying
in wicker chairs heaped with voluptuous-looking cushions. A
third, in pyjamas of the latest cut, was leaning over the side,
smoking a cigarette. The obvious owner had turned aside for a
moment to speak with the engineer.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't go if I were you, Ned," the girl on the raft
begged. "We can't tell who the crowd are in that boat," she went
on, under her breath, "and it isn't worth while risking anything.
Seems queer, if you come to think of it, that they should be
inviting strangers to go aquaplaning all the morning."</p>

<p>Her brother, however, was already in the water, swimming to
the place where the board was floating. He turned on his back and
waved his hand.</p>

<p>"I signalled I'd go," he said, "so I'd better have a short
turn. The skipper's a harmless-looking old duck, anyway."</p>

<p>It was too late now for anything further in the way of
intervention. Caroline Loyd, sitting on the edge of the raft,
watched her brother clamber on to the board, listened to the roar
of the engines as the launch started off, and still watched as,
skilfully manipulating the ropes, he rose cautiously but expertly
to his feet. In a moment they were off, Ned Loyd a graceful,
swaying figure firmly established upon the board, the nose of the
boat, large though she was, slightly out of the water, and a long
trail of white, churned-up sea already behind them. The girl kept
her face averted from her immediate neighbours, for although she
had no idea why, fear, for almost the first time in her life, had
come to her.</p>

<p>"Who owns that boat, anyway?" she asked presently. "Does any
one know?"</p>

<p>Apparently no one did. There were a variety of rumours passed
back to her from one or another of the loungers upon the rafts. A
newcomer, who had just swum over from the shore, brought the
latest information.</p>

<p>"Commodore B. Jasen, he calls himself," the latter announced,
as he clambered up the steps and sank into a prone position.
"They say that he is a multimillionaire and that he has taken the
Ch&acirc;teau d'Antibes for the season."</p>

<p>A young bond salesman from Wall Street pricked up his
ears.</p>

<p>"Commodore B. Jasen," he repeated thoughtfully. "Well, he
didn't make his money down our way or I should have heard
something of him."</p>

<p>The girl seemed to have forgotten her sun-bathing. She stood
on the edge of the raft&mdash;a magnificent figure in her scanty
but elegant swimming costume&mdash;shading her eyes with her
hand. Not once did she look away from the boat. She watched it
take a shorter run than usual towards Cannes, watched it sweep
round, leaving behind a trough of water and a long trail of foam,
watched the swaying figure of the man who, tense and alert all
the time, gripped the cords of the plane to which he seemed
somehow or other to have become permanently attached. The boat,
travelling at great speed, was almost opposite, now about quarter
of a mile away. She waved her arm&mdash;a significant and
imperative signal&mdash;but she realised, almost as she did it,
that there was scant chance of any one aquaplaning at thirty or
forty kilometres an hour looking to the right or to the left.
Exactly what she had dreaded happened. The boat failed to make
the usual turn. It swept on towards the long tongue of land known
as Mosque Point, wheeled round it and out of sight. That was the
last any one ever saw of Ned Loyd, better known amongst his
college friends and the new world into which he had made
tentative entrance as "Lord God Ned."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">IT was half an hour before uneasiness manifested
itself in action, during which time there was no sign of the
return of the mysterious launch or its aquaplaning passenger. The
blue sea was as unruffled as ever, the sunshine as fierce, the
faint breath of westerly wind still gentle and imperceptible. The
majority of the bathers had taken no note of the incident at all.
They were either in the sea again, or were lying on the rocks
anointing themselves, or had clambered up to the restaurant
above. The two who were more deeply concerned&mdash;Caroline Loyd
and Ralph Joslin, a slim dark young man with the complexion
almost of an Indian, who had been lying a little apart from the
others and had spoken to no one&mdash;were already making their
way along the beach through the pine woods towards the other side
of the point. The young man was only mildly puzzled. He failed to
understand his companion's emotion, or to grasp why, through the
wonderful tan of her cheeks, the pallor of fear had begun to show
itself.</p>

<p>"What's your worry, Caroline?" he asked. "Aquaplaning is
child's business to Ned."</p>

<p>"What made them drive on straight past the point?" she
demanded almost fiercely. "They always set down passengers near
the rafts."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't see that that amounts to anything," he argued.
"If the old man's taken the Ch&acirc;teau d'Antibes, why they've
probably gone round there for a drink. Seems natural enough to
me. Every one takes a fancy to the lad&mdash;you know that. What
are you scared of, Carrie? You're not afraid of Ned taking the
glad eye from the women?"</p>

<p>"Not I," she scoffed, although there was a sob in her throat.
"That isn't my business, but I've got a queer hunch, Ralph. I
expect I'll be laughing at it in a few minutes. You saw the cable
about looking out for the Lebworthy Gang?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw that," he admitted. "What about it?"</p>

<p>"Seeing that they were supposed to be coming out here," she
went on breathlessly, "I think Ned might have thought twice
before he picked up with a strange crowd."</p>

<p>Her companion laughed reassuringly.</p>

<p>"It's a hell of a long way from Rimmington Drive or back of
Broadway to Antibes here."</p>

<p>"They are all such a social lot at the hotel," she went on,
almost as though she had not heard him, "but no one seems to know
anything about these people at the Ch&acirc;teau. Still, it isn't
likely&mdash;it isn't likely, Ralph, is it?"</p>

<p>"What isn't likely?" he demanded almost roughly.</p>

<p>"It isn't likely that these people should have anything to do
with the Lebworthy Gang?"</p>

<p>"You've been reading too much crime fiction, Caroline," he
expostulated. "That crowd have had me guessing more than once,
but I'm not figuring about seeing any of them just in these
particular parts. Save your breath, kid. It's rough walking,
this."</p>

<p>They scrambled across a stretch of shingle through somebody's
garden and on to another beach. Then something like a tragedy
confronted them. They were on the other side of the point now,
but nowhere in sight of them was anything resembling a motor
launch, nor was there anywhere to be seen the bobbing head of a
swimmer!</p>

<p>"Don't you start worrying," Ralph enjoined cheerfully, as
their eyes swept the empty space simultaneously. "The
Ch&acirc;teau's just round the next corner. We'll have to make
our way there somehow or other. There's a wall to climb and
somebody else's garden to cross. Guess we'd better have
telephoned."</p>

<p>They scrambled forwards. To avoid the wall, they entered the
sea and swam&mdash;side by side and without a word to each
other&mdash;the man with strong, fierce strokes and the girl with
almost frenzied speed. Presently they reached a long broken
cluster of rocks, over which they clambered and dropped down on
to the next beach. Right ahead of them was a small harbour in
which the motor boat was lying, silent and apparently deserted.
By its side was also a small sailing craft and a dinghy, both
moored to floating buoys. They hurried along, the girl breaking
into a little run whenever there was a strip of sand. In less
than ten minutes they had reached the launch. The passengers had
evidently all left, for the decks were deserted and the cabin
also was apparently empty. They hurried down the wooden dock and
stepped on board. In response to Ralph Joslin's shout, a man in
blue overalls&mdash;apparently a mechanic&mdash;thrust his head
out from the cabin.</p>

<p>"Hello," he challenged. "Wot yer looking for?"</p>

<p>"Where's the man you took aquaplaning?" Ralph Joslin
demanded.</p>

<p>The mechanic displayed a little more of himself and stretched
his long limbs.</p>

<p>"Ask me another," he replied. "He waved his hand and slid off
the plane just after we rounded the point."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you stop?"</p>

<p>"Why the hell should we?" was the surly retort. "We were only
thirty yards from the shore. He got off of his own accord."</p>

<p>Hope shone once more in the girl's eyes. On the other hand,
her companion did not appear to share her relief.</p>

<p>"If your passenger got off at the point," the latter remarked,
"we should have met him."</p>

<p>"I can't help your troubles," the mechanic said sourly. "It's
my job to run this boat and I don't worry about what happens to
the passengers, especially when they're fools enough to go riding
on them slither boards. If he couldn't swim the thirty yards
between him and the point, he should never have got on the
board.... Here's the Boss. You can ask him anything you want
to."</p>

<p>The man withdrew his head and shoulders and disappeared. His
questioners turned round. A very trim and precise-looking elderly
gentleman, with white hair brushed back with almost meticulous
care, a white moustache and benevolent expression, dressed in
correct nautical attire, came hurrying breathlessly down the
plank walk and stepped on board.</p>

<p>"What's this I hear?" he asked anxiously. "They're telephoning
from the hotel to say that the young man I took aquaplaning has
not returned."</p>

<p>"That's what we've come over about," Ralph Joslin replied. "We
saw you pass our landing places and round the point. He was
holding on then and going strong. We waited but nothing happened.
You didn't bring him back and we've seen nothing of him."</p>

<p>"Extraordinary," the other exclaimed. "I should have dropped
him by the raft, but I had called out a few minutes before and
asked him to come round as far as the Ch&acirc;teau and have a
cocktail. He seemed to me to accept, so we went straight on. When
we got to the point, though, he waved his hand, let go quite in
the manner of an expert, and dived. Naturally we came along home
then. He was only a few yards from the shore."</p>

<p>The girl's eyes had never left the speaker's face. She seemed
to be weighing every word he uttered.</p>

<p>"We have just come across the point," she said. "There wasn't
a soul anywhere about."</p>

<p>The owner of the launch smiled reassuringly.</p>

<p>"My dear lady," he explained, "the point is much longer than
it seems, and if you came the direct way, you might easily have
missed your friend. Besides, he may have taken the opportunity of
staying to examine that queer building at the end. My own guests
are always curious about it. You'd better allow me to send you
back in the launch to your landing stage, and when you get there,
you will surely find the young man waiting for you."</p>

<p>"Might I enquire your name, sir?" Ralph Joslin asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly," was the courteous reply. "Jasen&mdash;Commodore
Jasen. I am very sorry if my offer to your friend has brought you
any disquietude. Tim," he went on, calling to the mechanic, "take
this lady and gentleman back to the Cap landing. You can manage
alone for that short distance."</p>

<p>The man made his way towards the engine, rubbing his hands
with a piece of waste. The Commodore stepped off the launch and
beamed at his departing visitors.</p>

<p>"You'll find him there, all right," he called out
cheerily.</p>

<p>There must have been something crazy in her blood that day,
Caroline Loyd told herself fiercely. Looking back, it seemed to
her that there was an almost satanic expression in that
apparently bland, benevolent face, something menacing in the
simple words. She swung around to seek consolation for her
companion, but Ralph Joslin had none to offer. A memory had come
to him&mdash;a memory touched with inspiration&mdash;and he knew,
as well as though he could see it written in the flaming blue
skies, that never again in this world would he see his friend and
leader, Ned Loyd.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">CAROLINE LOYD heard all the hours of early
morning strike. The long night with its anxieties was past. It
had become an accepted fact now that her brother had disappeared.
When the first shiver of light came from the east, she found
herself standing on the balcony of her room at Cap d'Antibes. The
paling stars were fading into the sky, the moon was colourless.
Away eastward the morn was strangely heralded by breaking lines
of cream-coloured foamy clouds with the faintest background of
saffron pink. It was the one hour of complete silence in the
twenty-four. She leaned forward, listening intently. A pearly
mist rode on the far seas. From somewhere behind that came the
faintest sounds. She clutched the balustrade and listened. Every
moment it became more distinct. Now she was sure. The break in
the skies eastward became more pronounced. Soon twilight was to
pass and a disc of the sun would be visible. Her beautiful eyes,
strained and frantically searching, sought to pierce those mists.
All the time the sound continued, the dull beating of a muffled
engine. Even before the first gleam of sunlight had escaped, it
had slid into sight. From some errand far southwards, the motor
boat of Commodore Jasen was rushing homewards towards its
harbourage.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">ENTIRELY at her ease, with scant signs of the
tragedy weighing upon her heart, a tragedy which hung, in fact,
like a cloud over the whole of the little community, Caroline, on
the following evening, waited in the shabby magnificence of the
library of the Ch&acirc;teau d'Antibes for the man whom she had
come to see. Her eyes were dry. There were no longer any signs of
the tempest which had swept over her. The first lesson she had
learned, when she had embarked upon the life adventurous, was the
lesson of self-control. She had lost a good deal of sympathy at
the H&ocirc;tel du Cap d'Antibes during the last twenty-four
hours; every one had thought her inclined to be callous. No one
realised from what a battlefield of the emotions her
hyperphilosophic attitude had arisen.</p>

<p>Hawk-faced, slim of features and of person, Jake Arnott came
into the room with his usual stealthy tread, a pantherlike effigy
of a man, notwithstanding his correct dinner attire, the monocle
which hung from his neck and the signet ring upon his little
finger. He closed the door carefully behind him.</p>

<p>"And what," he asked, "does Caroline Loyd want of us?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of you," she answered curtly. "My visit is to
Commodore Jasen."</p>

<p>"We have friends dining," he explained, "local notabilities
with whom we wish to stand well. It is, in fact, our d&eacute;but
into local society, stage-managed, I am afraid, by the local land
agent, but still, important to us. The Commodore thought that
perhaps I might deputise."</p>

<p>"The Commodore should have known better," she said coldly. "He
can take his own time. I shall wait for him here."</p>

<p>"As you wish," he observed. "I can tell you all you want to
know."</p>

<p>"I shall hear it," she replied, "from the man whom I hold
responsible."</p>

<p>Jake Arnott, once, alas, graduate of Harvard, later of
Chicago, now major-domo in the house of crime, turned on his heel
and left the room without a word or gesture of farewell. The
minutes passed. To Caroline, waiting before the half-opened
window, with the flash of the lighthouse every thirty seconds
travelling over the tops of the trees, and the murmur of the sea
in her ears, those minutes seemed to become crystallised nuggets
in her memory, each one with its measure of burning passion. When
at last the period of waiting came to an end, it did so without
warning. There was no sound of footsteps outside, but the door
was quietly opened and Commodore Jasen stepped deliberately in.
His dinner clothes were as immaculate as his yachting costume.
His eyes shone with sympathy. His attitude was half apologetic,
half deprecating.</p>

<p>"Madame," he said, "a thousand apologies. If I have kept you
waiting, I regret. We have friends dining from different parts of
the Riviera. It was too late to put them off, even in face of
such a tragedy."</p>

<p>Caroline Loyd listened. She had the air of one who had come to
listen more than to talk.</p>

<p>"I shall have to wait a great deal longer, Commodore," she
said, with a peculiar smile at the corner of her lips. "I think
that my feet will have to beat time through life for many years,
before I gain what I seek from you. For the present, you can
guess, I think, what it is I need."</p>

<p>"My dear lady, in any expression of my regret&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you mind leaving off?" she interrupted coldly. "We can do
without all that rubbish. I want to hear from your own lips that
you are the person responsible for what happened yesterday."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence. Commodore Jasen's face had lost its
benevolent expression. There was a glint of something repellent
in his eyes. It was the same light which had flashed its
terrifying message into her apprehension, when he had waved his
hand in sarcastic farewell from the wooden quay some thirty-six
hours ago. Still he persevered.</p>

<p>"Do you need to come here to ask that?" he demanded. "I am the
lessee of the Ch&acirc;teau and I am the person who was
responsible for inviting your brother to take a ride with us upon
the sea."</p>

<p>That, for the moment, was the end of Commodore Jasen.
Something seemed to blaze out from the girl which paralysed any
retort upon his part. In the duologue, for the next few minutes,
he was no longer a vital factor.</p>

<p>"I know who you are, Samuel Lebworthy," she cried. "I know
what you stand for. I know where you will end. Three years' mild
detention, probably, while the others swing. You're as clever as
hell&mdash;you play the show piece always in front of the tragedy
to divert people's attention. You and I may have plenty to say to
each other in the future, but don't waste my time to-night.
Answer me in plain words&mdash;exactly what have you done with my
brother?"</p>

<p>"He got just what was coming to him, that's all. Might come to
any of us at any time," he added, critically selecting a
cigarette from his case. "He got put away."</p>

<p>She listened with unchanged expression.</p>

<p>"You admit it?"</p>

<p>There was a look of gentle remonstrance in his blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Admit it? What a stupid word. It was quite inevitable. Ned
knew that."</p>

<p>"Tell me how you did it," she begged. "Ned was a better man
than you with fists or a gun, and he could have swum home from
your harbour."</p>

<p>The Commodore reflected for a moment.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But no brains to speak of. I shot him through the
cabin window, with one of the new Derlicher rifles, just after we
had rounded the Point. As you people were making such a fuss we
fished up the body last night and took it out where no one is
likely to find it. Anything else?"</p>

<p>"You are in a hurry to return to your guests?"</p>

<p>"Not particularly. I am playing bridge, but my hand is down
and there are two or three to take my place. If there is anything
else you have to say, let me hear it, now that we are alone
together."</p>

<p>"Where did Ned cross your gang?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"My dear young lady," he remonstrated, "it is scarcely
possible that you do not know. What has happened has been just in
the ordinary course of events. You would have thought nothing of
it in Chicago, less in New York. Ned and I got across over a
certain Mr. Timothy D. Ryan, who was our fellow passenger on the
steamer. We both quite naturally marked him down. There wasn't
room for both of us. That's the long and short of it. We had it
up against Ned already and Ned went; the better man
survives."</p>

<p>"Are you the better man?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Come to me," he replied, "and I'll prove it. We might even
consider giving you a small share in the Ryan business. Ned knew
quite well that we always wanted you both."</p>

<p>She looked at him with scorn in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I am perfectly satisfied with my position. I prefer to work
alone. One thing I do claim, however, and that is a half share in
the Ryan business. If you refuse to give it me, you may regret
it."</p>

<p>He looked at her in mild amusement.</p>

<p>"Just what do your threats mean?" he asked. "You are perhaps
thinking of the French police? Would it be possible that you know
so little of the etiquette of our profession?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied. "I am not thinking of the French police.
There are surer ways than that."</p>

<p>"You have nothing of a gang to work with," he pointed out. "I
know the few stragglers on whom you rely, inside out. They will
take you nowhere. If you butt up against us, you will be wiped
out. Come along to the other side of the street, Caroline. We'll
take care of you."</p>

<p>She laughed in his face.</p>

<p>"Is this a challenge or an invitation?" she asked.</p>

<p>His fingers toyed for a moment with his white moustache.</p>

<p>"You can take it which way you like," he said. "Come to us
alone, cut out those other suckers, and you shall stand in even
shares with Jake and myself in all fresh business. Those little
witches we shipped over from New York mean nothing to us. Who you
are or where you come from, God only knows, but you're the sort
of woman we want. Make up your mind to it and come along. I'll
fetch you myself some time, if you don't."</p>

<p>On the table by her side was a glass which Jake Arnott had
been carrying in his hand when he had entered the room. She
caught it up and hurled it across at him. With a lightning-like
dive he let it pass over his head and splinter against the
fireplace.</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't do that," he complained mildly. "We pay a
very heavy rent for this Ch&acirc;teau, and breakages count
against us. Am I to take it that you are not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are to take it that I am your enemy," she interrupted
fiercely. "You are to take it that whatever scheme you engage in,
I shall do my best to wreck. You are to take it that the spirits
of two people dwell in me&mdash;the spirit of Ned and my own. So
that's that."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders as he pressed the bell.</p>

<p>"I would rather," he said, "have had you on my side."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">WHEN, a week or so later, Commodore Jasen and
his friend Jake Arnott strolled out on to the terrace through one
of the mercifully opened windows of the Salle Priv&eacute;e at
Monte Carlo, they received a most unpleasant shock. Caroline
Loyd, in a most becoming after-bathing costume of embroidered
white serge, was lying there, gazing dreamily away towards
Italy.</p>

<p>"Hello," she murmured. "Where's Mr. Timothy B. Ryan?"</p>

<p>"What did you say?" the Commodore demanded.</p>

<p>"Mr. Timothy B. Ryan," she repeated. "President of the Chicago
Wheat Crushing Mills. A very important man, Mr. Ryan. I thought
you were here to look after him."</p>

<p>"What the mischief do you know about Tim Ryan?" Jake Arnott
inquired, his teeth and eyes glittering.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite a great deal," she replied. "He crossed on the same
steamer with Ned, you know, and we had some very interesting
plans all arranged with him. I can't quite get your scheme, but I
know that it's something very important. It means keeping him out
of the way for a fortnight at least, doesn't it? Well, I suppose
that might be done, but I am rather curious," she went on, with
an insolent little smile, "as to how you mere men can do it. That
Zeigfeld Folly show you have over at the Ch&acirc;teau won't make
much impression on Mr. Timothy Ryan, I don't think."</p>

<p>"Curse you," Commodore Jasen muttered.</p>

<p>"A compliment," she acknowledged. "If I am to be cursed, I am
to be feared. In this case, I should not think there was the
slightest doubt about it. I am a very dangerous woman."</p>

<p>"Out with it," Jake Arnott demanded. "What's your game,
Caroline? Come over with it."</p>

<p>"Why on earth should I tell you?" she answered lazily. "Ned
discovered him and, if you want to know what I think about it, I
believe that's the sole reason why you bumped him off. I offered
to come in fifty-fifty and our dear friend the Commodore evaded
the point."</p>

<p>"Well, what about it now?" the latter asked ungraciously.</p>

<p>She scrutinised her fingernails for a moment.</p>

<p>"I am inclined," she confessed, "to rescue him."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"He would be very grateful. Gratitude is sometimes more
remunerative even than blackmail. He is a widower. I might marry
him."</p>

<p>They turned their backs upon her. She followed them into the
room. At the nearest table, in the most important place by the
side of the croupier, sat Mr. Timothy B. Ryan, and the stacks of
chips in front of him amounted to many thousands. He greeted his
friends with a cheerful grin. They saw, however, with sinking
hearts, his eyes travel over their shoulders, the lines of mirth
fade from his face and something new appear, something which they
had never previously associated with Mr. Timothy B. Ryan. There
was a faint odour of perfume just by the Commodore's left
nostril. He felt a touch upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Won't you please present me to Mr. Ryan? I believe a friend
of mine crossed from New York with him."</p>

<p>Mr. Ryan rose to his feet. The fact that he had thirty
<i>mille</i> upon the table and that the ball was spinning seemed
to be a negligible happening. He gazed instead into the face of
the most beautiful woman he had ever seen in his life, a woman
too who was smiling at him.</p>

<p>"I don't worry about your friend, Miss Loyd," he said, "but I
am surely glad to know you."</p>

<p>She smiled into his face. The ball dropped into its appointed
destination. Mr. Timothy B. Ryan had lost his thirty thousand
francs. The incident left him unmoved. It seemed to him that he
had found something far more wonderful.</p>

<p>"The Commodore has just invited me to have a drink," she lied
sweetly. "You would not care to come with us?"</p>

<p>He swept his pile of chips from the table and dropped them
into his jacket pocket. A few he left to mark his place.</p>

<p>"A drink," he confessed, "was just what I was needing."</p>

<p>"You're sure you are not missing the game?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Miss Loyd," he declared with fervour, "I am missing nothing
that won't be made up to me a hundred times over in the bar
there."</p>

<p>Her little laugh was a quite satisfactory response.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">MR. TIMOTHY B. RYAN, comfortably established in
the principal guest room at the Ch&acirc;teau d'Antibes, yawned
in somewhat aggrieved fashion as he opened his eyes on the
following morning to find his host standing by his bedside. It
was before the hour at which he had expected to be called, and he
raised himself in bed somewhat sleepily.</p>

<p>"You're an early bird, Commodore, aren't you?" he remarked. "I
ordered my coffee for nine o'clock."</p>

<p>"That's all right," the other assured him. "It will arrive in
a few minutes. I thought I would like just a short chat with you
before you get up."</p>

<p>"Good for you," Mr. Ryan, who had drunk a great deal of whisky
the night before, murmured drowsily. "Say, you boys got me lit up
last night. I'll be the better after a swim. Any news of the
lady?"</p>

<p>"You will probably see her during the morning," his host
confided. "She has a good many friends over at the hotel and we
all meet about cocktail time. Meanwhile, there's just a word or
two I'd like to say."</p>

<p>Mr. Ryan swung a couple of rather pudgy pyjama-clad legs out
of bed, stretched himself vigorously and rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>"Shoot," he invited.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear by any chance, Mr. Ryan, of the Lebworthy
Gang? They started in Chicago, you know, and then moved to New
York."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have heard of them," was the prompt admission. "Who
hasn't? Pretty quiet they've been lately."</p>

<p>"That," Commodore Jasen explained, "is because they have once
more changed their quarters. Chicago to New York&mdash;New York
to Antibes."</p>

<p>Mr. Timothy B. Ryan paused in the midst of a yawn.</p>

<p>"Who the hell are you getting at?" he demanded
incredulously.</p>

<p>"No one," was the suave reply. "I am telling you the truth. It
saves time. You are in the hands of the Lebworthy Gang at the
present moment. It will cost you five hundred thousand dollars.
Not so very much for a man who must have cleaned up ten or twelve
millions last year."</p>

<p>Mr. Timothy Ryan's mouth was wide open, his hands were
clasping his knees, his position on the edge of the bed was
precarious and his general appearance ridiculous.</p>

<p>"Are you kidding me, Commodore?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. I am trying to save time. Explanations are
so troublesome. I thought if we could finish our little business
in the way I can suggest, you might enjoy your coffee, and I
could probably, if you behave sensibly, devise some means of
pleasant entertainment for you during the latter part of the
day."</p>

<p>"So I am in the hands of the Lebworthy Gang, am I?" Mr. Ryan
reflected.</p>

<p>"You are."</p>

<p>"And it is going to cost me five hundred thousand
dollars?"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>The victim of this unfortunate circumstance scratched his
head.</p>

<p>"How," he asked shrewdly, "do you expect to get that money
from me at all, and how, having got it, do you expect to keep my
mouth shut?"</p>

<p>"Pertinent questions," the Commodore admitted. "I will answer
you as briefly as possible. We start with some knowledge of your
affairs, you see. Here," he went on, drawing out a cable form
from his pocket, "is a despatch written out to your firm, which
will be handed in this morning at Monte Carlo."</p><br>

<p class="telegram"><tt>"STREAK OF BAD LUCK HERE. CABLE FIVE
HUNDRED THOUSAND BARCLAY'S BANK, MONTE CARLO. TIMOTHY B. RYAN,
CH&Acirc;TEAU D'ANTIBES."</tt></p><br>

<p>"Good," Mr. Ryan approved. "That's the first step. The half
million dollars will be cabled over, all right. How do you expect
to get the bank to hand the money over to you?"</p>

<p>"You will endorse them over to us upon persuasion."</p>

<p>"And keep my mouth shut afterwards?"</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"There are men who like to live," he reflected, "and there are
others who prefer to die. You may be one of the others. There
were one or two in Chicago. There were two in New York."</p>

<p>"You mean you would put me away?"</p>

<p>"Nothing in this world," was the emphatic declaration, "would
be more certain. You might," he went on, "bring some slight
inconvenience upon us, you might even force us to change our
habitation, although that I think very doubtful, but there is
nothing surer in this world&mdash;and you know it, Timothy
Ryan&mdash;than that your days upon this earth would be numbered.
You would be lying somewhere under the sunshine with a bullet
through your heart, or somewhere deep down in the Mediterranean,
surrounded by curious little fish with unpleasant masticatory
habits. No one is ever alive twenty-four hours after the
Lebworthy Gang has doomed them to die."</p>

<p>"Well, well!" Mr. Ryan murmured thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"You have to make the choice," his host went on. "I believe
you are worth something like twenty millions. You have to make
your choice whether you will go on living with nineteen million
five hundred thousand or leave twenty millions to your legatees,
whoever they may be. To a reasonable man, the choice should be
simple."</p>

<p>"Could I have my coffee and a bath on this?" Mr. Ryan
asked.</p>

<p>His host touched the bell.</p>

<p>"You can indeed," he assented.</p>

<p>A sombre-looking manservant answered the summons&mdash;of
French appearance but with an American accent. He arranged a
breakfast table by the side of the bed, but Mr. Ryan pointed to
the recess in front of the window.</p>

<p>"Guess I'll taste a little of this Mediterranean breeze," he
decided. "It will cool my head off."</p>

<p>"You can now prepare the bath," the Commodore directed, "and
put out some suitable clothes for Mr. Ryan. Perhaps you would
prefer a bathing suit?"</p>

<p>"That goes all right with me," the latter agreed, stumping
across the room. "Coffee smells good."</p>

<p>The servant, evidently a well-trained one, produced a dressing
gown in which the visitor robed himself. The Commodore drew up an
easy-chair on the other side of the window. Together they looked
out on the very pleasant view&mdash;the little harbour below with
the famous motor boat and sailing craft, and beyond the open
sea.</p>

<p>"Nice spot this," the prisoner observed, as he poured out his
coffee.</p>

<p>"Charming," his companion agreed. "Very expensive to rent,
though," he went on, studying his finger nails.</p>

<p>"I have struck some expensive hotels," Mr. Ryan confided, as
he buttered a piece of toast, "but five hundred thousand dollars
for bed and board&mdash;for how long?"</p>

<p>"A week with pleasure," his host suggested.</p>

<p>"Well, even for a week that's a little stiff. Besides which,
the great inducement I was promised never appeared."</p>

<p>"Surely Zo&euml; and Laura have their attractions," the
Commodore remonstrated.</p>

<p>"The usual Broadway stuff," his guest criticised. "I can pack
that sort of rubbish in my own satchel any time I come across, if
I want to. But the other&mdash;" Mr. Ryan kissed the tips of his
pudgy fingers out of the window, towards the hotel where Caroline
Loyd was at that moment also looking seawards and making plans.
"You might send the cable, anyway," he decided. "I guess they'll
get it at opening time this morning. Something like six hours
behind, aren't we? They'll toot the money across. Between now and
then, I can make up my mind whether I part or whether I take on
the Lebworthy Gang."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen smiled.</p>

<p>"You are the type of man, sir," he said, "with whom I like to
transact business."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">COMMODORE JASEN proved himself rather a severe
gaoler, for it appeared that his guest developed a headache
during the morning, and it was the Commodore who sat with
Caroline Loyd at one of the tented tables in the open-air bar at
the Cap, and sipped a wonderful concoction of orange juice at a
few minutes before luncheon time. Caroline, in the opinion of
every one there, had that morning surpassed herself. Her pyjamas
were the most delicate shade of pearly pink, their cut was the
last degree of elegance. From the shine of her burnished hair to
the modified polish of her toe-nails, she was the most perfect
thing that the Cap d'Antibes could produce.</p>

<p>"What have you done with my admirer?" she asked
querulously.</p>

<p>"He is awaiting a despatch from New York," was the urbane
reply. "As soon as it arrives and our little piece of business is
transacted, it will give us all the greatest pleasure to have you
dine and meet him again."</p>

<p>"I wonder," she reflected, "what it would be like to dine at
the Ch&acirc;teau."</p>

<p>"We should do our best to make it agreeable," her companion
assured her.</p>

<p>"Yes," she meditated, "I am sure you would do that. You made
his last few hours agreeable to Ned, didn't you?"</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen showed every desire to be tolerant.</p>

<p>"You know perfectly well that Ned asked for it," he pointed
out. "He was already upon the black list, and we knew for a fact
that he had invited our friend Ryan to visit him at your hotel,
although he was quite well aware that we had our own plans for
the entertainment of that gentleman. You must admit that it was
stupid."</p>

<p>"Yes, it was stupid," she agreed. "I warned him."</p>

<p>"We do not wish," the Commodore continued emphatically, "to
run these unnecessary risks. We do not wish to have to proceed to
these extreme measures. Year by year crime is becoming more
civilised. We try to make a fine art of it. We must have money.
We collect it from those who can afford to pay, and we prefer to
cut out the rough stuff altogether. On the other hand, when the
necessity arises, you know very well what our reputation is."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," she admitted.</p>

<p>"We can be, and often are, absolutely and entirely ruthless,"
the Commodore confided, a queer unpleasant expression tightening
up the lines of his face. "I talked it over with the others when
we made this move. We are going to work peaceably if we can, but
if any one doesn't want that sort of treatment, if there is any
one who hesitates to come across with what we want, Chicago and
New York won't have anything on Antibes."</p>

<p>"And what about Mr. Ryan?"</p>

<p>"We are hoping," the Commodore proceeded gently, dropping his
voice a little and exchanging a benevolent smile with a group of
passing acquaintances, "that there will be no trouble. We do not
wish for trouble. What we want is half a million dollars."</p>

<p>"And none for me," she grumbled.</p>

<p>"Naturally not," was the firm reply. "You can leave your
friends and come to us altogether on reasonable terms if you
wish. Otherwise&mdash;hands off!"</p>

<p>Caroline drew a little sigh and smoothed the silk of her
pyjamas petulantly.</p>

<p>"I consider that Ryan <i>was</i> our business," she
declared.</p>

<p>"Possession," the Commodore remarked amiably, "is nine tenths
of the law."</p>

<p>The under concierge from the hotel had paused at their table.
He addressed Caroline.</p>

<p>"There is a telephone message for Madame from Marseilles," he
announced.</p>

<p>For a moment Caroline frowned. She glanced swiftly at her
companion to see if he had overheard. He was watching with dreamy
eyes the flight of some seagulls.</p>

<p>"Is the message put through down here?" she enquired.</p>

<p>The boy pointed to the telephone booth.</p>

<p>"It is here, Madame."</p>

<p>Caroline rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"I am wanted," she said. "Afterwards it is luncheon time. Au
revoir, Commodore."</p>

<p>He rose and bowed gallantly.</p>

<p>"Au revoir, Miss Loyd."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE presiding genius of Barclay's Bank, Monte
Carlo, was evidently of a hospitable disposition, for a portion
of the floor space of the bank was devoted to a long table
covered with copies of the latest journals and maps and
surrounded with easy-chairs. The public, clients of the bank at
any rate, were invited to treat the place as a sort of club, and
as the chairs presented a very good vantage ground for pouncing
upon the manager, or under manager, when he passed that way, the
unspoken invitation was freely accepted.</p>

<p>Mr. Timothy B. Ryan and Commodore Jasen sat, on the following
morning, side by side at this table. They had cleared a little
space in front of them and an official had deposited there a
blotting pad, ink and pens. Mr. Tunney, the bank manager,
introduced to big business, was always at his best.</p>

<p>"Yes, we received the credit before closing time yesterday,"
he admitted. "Everything seems to be in order, Mr. Ryan. What can
we do for you?"</p>

<p>"Our friend," Commodore Jasen explained, "has been exceedingly
unfortunate at the tables. I daresay you have read of the high
play at Juan and at Palm Beach? Mr. Ryan has been a heavy loser
at both Casinos, besides losing here. I have been supplying him
with money to the extent of my means, but although I don't call
myself a poor man, he has, I confess, finished me off. His first
desire, now that his money has arrived, is to pay his debts."</p>

<p>The manager produced a book of blank cheque forms and laid
them on the table.</p>

<p>"If Mr. Ryan likes to give you an open cheque," he said, "we
can cash it at once, or you can open a deposit account with us,
Commodore. You bank at Lloyds, I think?"</p>

<p>"I do for the moment," the other assented. "Mr. Ryan's desire
is to transfer the whole amount of his credit into my name."</p>

<p>The bank manager was startled.</p>

<p>"The whole amount?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess so," the American sighed. "Might leave twenty
thousand dollars for some sort of side show."</p>

<p>"I should like a draft payable in Rome for one hundred
thousand dollars," Commodore Jasen continued, "one payable in
Paris for two hundred thousand, one payable in London for a
hundred thousand, and two millions in French money here."</p>

<p>The bank manager made a few notes.</p>

<p>"This will take a little time," he pointed out.</p>

<p>"Get to work at once," Commodore Jasen suggested pleasantly
but with the necessary amount of impressiveness in his tone. "Mr.
Ryan and I will go up to the Royalty Bar and see you again in
half an hour."</p>

<p>The manager hurried away. Timothy B. Ryan bit savagely at the
stump of his cigar.</p>

<p>"I guess I'm making a fool of myself over this business," he
muttered. "Why should I stand for losing half a million dollars,
even though you are the Lebworthy Gang? The police here can't be
such a dud crowd as not to fasten onto a big thing when they're
put wise to it."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen appeared to be profoundly indifferent. He
flicked a particle of dust from the sleeve of his blue serge
coat.</p>

<p>"We have had all this out before," he reminded his friend.
"You can walk out of the bank if you like and refuse to do
another thing about it. You will probably be alive for twenty-
four hours, unless you go to the police. You certainly won't last
a week, though. It's a mortifying experience, no doubt, to have
to pay blackmail, but you have just this consolation about
it&mdash;we never touch the same person more than once."</p>

<p>Mr. Ryan looked more morose than ever. Suddenly his whole
expression changed. He laid down his cigar on the edge of the
table, shook the ash from his waistcoat, and, springing to his
feet, held out his hand.</p>

<p>"If this isn't Miss Loyd," he exclaimed. "The one person I've
been wanting to see."</p>

<p>"Not nearly so much as I and a few other people apparently
have been wanting to see you," she replied, as she shook hands.
"How are you, Commodore? Let me present my friend&mdash;Monsieur
Drouplain, Commodore Jasen, Mr. Timothy B. Ryan."</p>

<p>Monsieur Drouplain, who was a short, stiff little man with
closely cropped black hair and a fierce black moustache, had
apparently very little use for Commodore Jasen. He laid hold of
the American's hand and grasped it.</p>

<p>"You are Mr. Timothy B. Ryan of the firm Ryan and Butler of
Chicago?" he demanded. "Is that not so?"</p>

<p>"Why, sure," was the hearty reply. "Fancy your knowing about
my business."</p>

<p>"It is rather my business to know other people's," the
newcomer murmured.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Drouplain," Caroline explained, "is the Chef de la
S&ucirc;ret&eacute; at Marseilles. He is over here on account of
some cables he received yesterday from New York. You have good
friends, Mr. Ryan. Some of them over there seemed to have the
idea that you were getting into trouble."</p>

<p>"Mr. Ryan will give me ten minutes of his time at once," the
Chef de la S&ucirc;ret&eacute; begged, "and I will explain the
matter. I am staying at the H&ocirc;tel de Paris. Let us proceed
there."</p>

<p>He led the way to the door, his grasp on his companion's
shoulder a very firm one. The latter looked back.</p>

<p>"I guess I can sign those documents a little later on," he
called out to his host. "Come right along down to the hotel and
bring Miss Loyd with you. We might see about a bite of
luncheon."</p>

<p>The two men disappeared through the swing doors. Commodore
Jasen had scarcely moved in his chair. His eyes were like steel
points of fire.</p>

<p>"Does this mean intervention on your part, Caroline?" he asked
quietly. "You know the price that you will pay? You know the
unspoken rule which exists between us and your people and every
one indulging in our activities in every city of the States and
the world? You know what resort to the police means?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do, my dear man," Caroline assured him, peering
into the mirror which she had drawn from her bag.</p>

<p>"It means death," the Commodore continued, without a quiver in
his tone. "It has meant death without a single break for the last
fifteen years. Even the police stand on one side. Not one living
soul has escaped."</p>

<p>Caroline thrust back a refractory wisp of fair hair underneath
the white cap she was wearing.</p>

<p>"Untidy, aren't I?" she observed. "You see, we motored
fast.... I know perfectly well the etiquette of our profession,
my friend, but you will have to believe for a moment what you can
prove afterwards with ease. It was not I who sent for the
police&mdash;I have not approached them in any way. I have
divulged nothing concerning your friend Mr. Ryan."</p>

<p>"Then what was the meaning of the telephone message from
Marseilles yesterday?" he snapped.</p>

<p>"I always knew you had exceptionally good ears," she sighed.
"All the same, you will have to take my word for it that that
message had nothing to do with the police."</p>

<p>The bank manager, who had an eye for feminine beauty,
approached the two. He bowed, but Commodore Jasen was in no
humour to introduce anybody to this pest of a
girl&mdash;especially such a valuable acquaintance as a
banker.</p>

<p>"Rather a formidable piece of business you and your friend
have given us, Commodore," he remarked. "I thought I'd better
tell you that it will take at least another hour to get all the
papers in order and your money counted out. If you can bring Mr.
Ryan back to sign after lunch, I think it would be better. You
see, we have a lot of tourists here this morning too, from the
American liner in port."</p>

<p>"I am so glad we have not to wait any longer," Caroline
murmured. "I was just trying to persuade the Commodore," she
added, looking up at the bank manager with a very sweet smile,
"to take me out and give me a cocktail."</p>

<p>"The Commodore," the manager declared, as he himself opened
the door for them, "is a very fortunate fellow."</p>

<p>Her companion objected to entering Caroline's car and they
drove down to the H&ocirc;tel de Paris in his own open limousine.
He whispered a word to his chauffeur as he stepped out, and the
latter was visible, a few moments later, loitering in the shadows
of the bar entrance. Caroline selected two comfortable chairs and
the Commodore lighted a cigarette with steady fingers. He had
chosen a place on the right-hand side of Caroline and within a
few yards of the open door. A very close observer might have
noticed something sinister in the way his fingers were caressing
the protuberance in his hip pocket. For anything he knew, this
might be a trap, and he was not to be caught unprepared. He took
swift stock of the room and was forced to decide that there was
not a suspicious-looking person in it. Caroline herself had edged
her chair a little closer to his, as though prepared for a few
minutes' intimate and pleasant conversation. There was not a
shadow of fear in her eyes, although she must have noticed his
chauffeur lounging outside and the stealthy movements of her
companion's fingers. He waited till the glasses were placed on
the table before them, then he leaned towards her.</p>

<p>"Caroline Loyd," he said, and his voice, although it was
pleasantly modulated, was full of menace, "if this is a trap, I
want you to understand that the first person who goes out will be
you. Two of us have you covered."</p>

<p>"Don't suggest such unpleasant things," she begged. "You are
spoiling my appetite and I am ravenously hungry. You've got
nothing against me. I'm even hoping that you will invite me to
lunch."</p>

<p>"How is it that the Chef de la S&ucirc;ret&eacute; of
Marseilles has come here to look for Ryan and it was you who
received the telephone message from Marseilles yesterday
morning?" Commodore Jasen demanded. "I'm waiting for an answer to
that question and it is about time I got it. Don't flirt about
with that mirror or come any nearer to me, Caroline. I can see
him coming in just as well as you. You may think the odds are in
your favour, but they aren't. There are two others here who've
got him covered&mdash;and you too&mdash;beside myself. If it's a
plant, you'll get what you deserve from me. Stay where you
are."</p>

<p>"My dear man," she remonstrated, "don't be absurd. <i>Ici,
Monsieur</i>," she called out.</p>

<p>The newcomer advanced with a smile and a bow.</p>

<p>"Dick," she said, "I congratulate you, for the
Commodore&mdash;who is really a very clever man&mdash;believes
that you are Monsieur Drouplain, Chef de la S&ucirc;ret&eacute;
at Marseilles! Where did you leave Mr. Ryan?"</p>

<p>"He's put it over the purser and got the state suite on the
boat," was the reply from the fierce little man in unexpectedly
broad American. "They're just off."</p>

<p>"Who is this person and what is he talking about?" the
Commodore gasped.</p>

<p>"Well," Caroline explained, "his name is Dick Ferber. He's one
of our little lot. Four of us altogether, you know. Two we left
at Marseilles&mdash;Dick had a little business on
there&mdash;Ralph is in Antibes, and myself. Dick, shake hands
with the Commodore."</p>

<p>"Glad to know you, I'm sure," the little man remarked with a
broad grin.</p>

<p>The Commodore did not reciprocate. Caroline shrugged her
shoulders.</p>

<p>"My dear man," she begged, "you must be a sport. There is
nothing in our Magna Charta against either of us outwitting the
other if the opportunity arises. If I had squealed, I knew quite
well that I should have signed my own death warrant. I never
dreamed of doing such a thing. You chose to cut me out of it and
run this little affair with Mr. Ryan by yourself. I decided to
teach you a lesson and to play a hand against you. I've played it
fairly. You have lost, and Mr. Ryan, who is now on the ocean, has
saved half a million dollars. He will keep his mouth shut and
there's no trouble anywhere. What about that lunch?"</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen drew a long breath and summoned the
barman.</p>

<p>"Telephone over for the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>," he
directed, "to bring the menu from the restaurant."</p>

<h2><a id="story2" name="story2">II.&mdash;THE TABLE UNDER THE
TREE</a></h2>

<h3>No record of magazine publication in this form found.<br>
Presumably appeared in <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i> in Jan 1932.</h3>

<p class="first">THERE were a scattered few of the little company
of <i>al fresco</i> diners at the Restaurant de la Pomme d'Or at
St. Paul, not so interested perhaps in their dinners or their
companions, who realised what was about to happen. To the
majority, however, the sudden darkness came almost as a shock. A
moment before, the whole place had been flooded with moonlight,
their plates, their fellow diners, the wine in their glasses, the
anxious face of the one overworked waiter hurrying back and forth
all plainly visible. Then, without the slightest warning, came
darkness. A fragment of inky black cloud had floated across the
surface of the moon with an amazing result. No longer could one
look down upon the valley below, stretching away towards the
pastures and the flowery land which led seawards, a vivid and
brilliant picture of moonlit beauty, every tree visible and the
rise and fall of the land as easily to be traced as at midday.
Below now was nothing but a black chasm of darkness, with an
occasional pin prick of light from the cottages or farmhouses on
the hillside. Where before it seemed to be a fairy panorama, one
could lean now over the terrace wall and peer over the edge of
the world into an impenetrable gloom. The little company of
guests seated at small tables became suddenly like shadowy,
unreal figures, chaotic in shape, their faces blurred streaks of
white upon the darkness.</p>

<p>There was a moment or two of almost complete silence, then a
little nervous laughter. The waiter was groping his way towards
the electric switch which turned on a shaded lamp at each table.
The girl who assisted him stumbled against a tree and dropped two
of the plates she was carrying with a crash. Almost
simultaneously there was another sound, clear and vibrant with
agony&mdash;without a doubt a human cry. At first, it seemed as
though it might have come from the darkness below, then to almost
every one came a feeling of shivering apprehension. It had come
from somewhere in their very midst, from one of themselves.
People began peering about with terrified eyes. Neighbours and
friends at different tables called to one another for
reassurance.</p>

<p>The owner of the restaurant put his head out from the doorway
which led to the inside premises and called loudly to the waiter
to hasten with the switch. No one thought of eating or drinking
during those tense seconds. Every one was eager, yet fearful, for
the coming of the light. At last from the first of the tables
came a flicker, and four startled people swung round in their
chairs to gaze terror-stricken into the gloom. The same thing
happened at the second and third. Then, as the light flashed out
from the fourth, the waiter stepped back with a shout&mdash;it
seemed like the scream of a woman. People rose in their places
and simultaneously through the wide-flung doors of the hotel
restaurant came a broad stream of added illumination. The fourth
table was occupied by a single man only. In the partial darkness
there might have seemed nothing unusual in his somewhat grotesque
attitude. In the clearer light one saw now that he was half
sprawling across the table and that there was a very sinister-
looking glitter from something rigid between his shoulder
blades.... Several of the women began to shriek. One fainted. The
men rushed forward and would have pressed to the table itself,
but Monsieur Canis, the owner of the place, was there to push
them back.</p>

<p>"Every one must stand clear," he insisted. "No one must come
near the table before the police. Jean has gone for the
gendarmes."</p>

<p>"Send for the doctor too," some one called out. "The man may
not be dead."</p>

<p>But there were very ugly evidences upon the table that the
affair was already hopeless.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE village gendarme arrived upon a scene of
much confusion. Some of the lights had refused to burn, and the
whole of the little outdoor <i>terrasse</i>, bordered with
tables, and night by night an oasis of pleasure and merriment,
seemed turned into a grim and ghastly tableau in which the
figures of the seated guests had grown shadowy and sinister. To
add to the weird effect, one of the stray dogs that haunted the
place had a strain of bloodhound in him, and was seated on his
haunches howling. The perspiring official wiped the sweat from
his forehead and gave excited directions to Monsieur Canis.</p>

<p>"No one must leave the place," he commanded. "Those at the
adjoining tables must remain in their seats. I am going to search
for the Commissaire. Who will lend an automobile?"</p>

<p>There were plenty of offers, and by the time the man took his
leave, having sipped plentifully from a glass of brandy which had
been thrust into his hand, the doctor of the little hill town had
arrived. The latter was more of the <i>savant</i> than the
ordinary practitioner and he was scared and startled at the sight
which he was called upon to face. His fingers stole tremblingly
forward toward their task. His examination disturbed nothing: it
was made with the gentleness of a woman. In a very few minutes he
rose to his feet and brushed the dust mechanically from his
trousers.</p>

<p>"The man was killed instantaneously," he announced. "The blade
of that knife is through the heart. He could have known nothing,
scarcely even felt any pain. Who is he?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Canis held up his hand. It was beginning to occur to
him that, although, possibly, he was a ruined man, he was
temporarily in a position of importance.</p>

<p>"No questions," he insisted. "It is for the police, this.
Every one must remain in their places."</p>

<p>The gates into the little enclosure, closed perhaps once or
twice in a lifetime, were pushed to, but there seemed to be no
one there who was in the least anxious to leave. Most of the
diners were members of the artist colony who lived together, more
or less communally, in one establishment close at hand, and
always took their evening meals at the restaurant. There were one
or two visitors from Nice, for the place had a vogue, and a few
others from Juan and Cagnes. They stood or sat about in little
groups, talking. The proprietor went from one to the other.</p>

<p>"If any one would wish to eat inside," he suggested, "it is
possible, so long as they don't leave the place. Nothing else can
be served here. Inside, there is emptiness."</p>

<p>But no one wanted to go inside.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE Commissaire arrived. He sprang from the
automobile and was across the open space, round which the dining
tables were arranged, in half a dozen swift strides. He was long
and lantern-jawed, with a hungry mouth and enquiring eyes. A
torrent of words streamed from his lips. The two gendarmes whom
he had brought with him and Monsieur Canis hastened to do his
bidding. In less than five minutes he had made a hurried
examination of the dead man, drawn a circle of chalk around the
scene of the tragedy, across which no one was permitted to tread,
and established himself at a table dragged into the centre of the
courtyard a few yards away. He spoke first to Monsieur Canis, who
explained that no one had witnessed the tragedy, that a passing
cloud had completely obscured the moon and, during the brief
interval of darkness, the murdered man's death cry had suddenly
startled everybody. He himself, Monsieur Canis, had been in the
kitchen and had heard nothing.</p>

<p>"The name of the deceased?" the Commissaire barked out.</p>

<p>There was only one of the diners who could tell him
that&mdash;a painter, strangely attired in a workman's blouse and
a pair of loose trousers.</p>

<p>"It was I whom he saw," he explained, "when he came to the
Ch&acirc;teau Pension for quarters as an artist. He told me that
his name was Paul Legarge and that he was a painter."</p>

<p>"What nationality?"</p>

<p>The other shook his head.</p>

<p>"He spoke French, but it was scarcely the French of a
Frenchman. English or American perhaps."</p>

<p>"Has any one else here spoken with the deceased?" the
Commissaire demanded.</p>

<p>The waiter and Monsieur Canis confessed to having exchanged
banalities concerning the view and on the matter of food. He had
spoken always in French.</p>

<p>"Was he dining alone?" the Commissaire asked.</p>

<p>"Naturally," Monsieur Canis assented.</p>

<p>"Who was at the table behind?" was the next question.</p>

<p>An <i>avocat</i> from Nice and his lady friend acknowledged
themselves. The Commissaire took their names.</p>

<p>"Now, tell me," he said, hunching his shoulders and leaning
forward. "You were within two metres of this murdered man. Can
you tell me that you saw no one plunge that knife into his
shoulders?"</p>

<p>"I saw no one," the <i>avocat</i> declared. "Nor could any one
else in my position. It was impossible to see even the table. As
for Madame, she was facing me, with her back towards the whole
affair. I neither heard nor saw any one. I simply heard the cry
and saw nothing until the lights went on."</p>

<p>"And there was no one standing up or moving about the
place?"</p>

<p>"No one except the waiter, and his hand was on the switch when
the lights went on."</p>

<p>The Commissaire glared round at everybody. It seemed apparent
that he considered every one of them a possible, even a probable
assassin.</p>

<p>"It is a circumstance most extraordinary," he declared, "that
in this small place, during a temporary cessation of moonlight, a
man should have been murdered in sight of all of you and no one
apparently saw the assassin leave this place or heard anything
but the cry. There is only one conclusion," he said, stretching
out his hand. "The murderer is still present."</p>

<p>There was a little shiver of emotion. Every one looked
fearfully around. For the moment there was no one who was not
under suspicion, from Monsieur Canis himself and his pale-faced,
weedy little waiter, to Monsieur Plessis, the wealthy
<i>avocat</i> from Nice.</p>

<p>"Has this Monsieur Legarge dined here before?" the Commissaire
demanded, resuming his examination.</p>

<p>"Several times," Monsieur Canis acknowledged. "On the last
occasion with one of the young ladies who dance at the small
cabaret up the hill."</p>

<p>The Commissaire grasped his pen. There were possibilities
here.</p>

<p>"What ladies?" he demanded. "I know nothing of any cabaret
show here."</p>

<p>"They were two young ladies who, with another one, I believe,
came over from America some months ago to entertain the guests of
an American millionaire living down at the Ch&acirc;teau
d'Antibes&mdash;Commodore Jasen. Chiefly, one believes, for their
amusement, the Commodore permitted them to give a small
entertainment here one night a week. This Monsieur Legarge was
apparently acquainted with them, for he brought one of the young
ladies here to dine."</p>

<p>"She is not here to-night?" the Commissaire snapped.</p>

<p>"One has seen nothing of either of the young ladies for some
days," Monsieur Canis replied.</p>

<p>"This unfortunate man&mdash;had he an apartment in St.
Paul?"</p>

<p>"Barely a hundred yards away."</p>

<p>"Is there any one here present," the Commissaire demanded,
"who can tell me more about the dead man, or who saw anything of
the event of to-night other than has been described?"</p>

<p>"I saw the man come in," the notary from Nice observed. "One
could scarcely fail to remark him, for he was wearing a claret-
coloured shirt and blue trousers, as though he had come straight
from the easel. He stood by his table for several minutes before
he sat down, and seemed to be looking around, as though to know
exactly who was here. He was restless, too, for after sitting
down for a few minutes, he got up and went inside."</p>

<p>"That was to drink an ap&eacute;ritif," Monsieur Canis
explained. "He came to me for it in the bar. He looked round the
room as though in search of some one and went back to his
table."</p>

<p>"He gave you the impression of being nervous?" the Commissaire
asked the notary.</p>

<p>The latter assented.</p>

<p>"When he sat down again he even looked over the parapet, as
though to see if there was any one on the terrace below."</p>

<p>The Commissaire stroked his chin.</p>

<p>"If he was afraid of any one," he remarked, "it is strange
that he should have chosen the one table which is in some measure
of obscurity&mdash;the table under the tree."</p>

<p>"He had sat there on each of his previous visits," Monsieur
Canis confided.</p>

<p>There was an interruption and revival of interest. Police
assistance had arrived from Nice with a detective and finger-
print expert. If anything was discovered, however, there was
little that found its way to the outside public, for before they
even commenced their investigations every one had been requested
to move inside. There were rumours flying about that night, but
nothing else....</p>

<p>The Pomme d'Or closed its doors early and from the street it
seemed that every light was extinguished. The little dancing
cabaret in the quaint Proven&ccedil;al barn a few hundred yards
away was never opened. The inhabitants of St. Paul were forced to
discuss the tragedy which had happened amongst them either in the
streets or in their own houses. At a little before midnight,
however, the Commissaire, accompanied by a gendarme, emerged from
the side door of the Pomme d'Or and mounted the crazy street to
the house which had been indicated as the temporary abode of the
murdered man. There was a small crowd on the pavement outside.
Madame, who owned the house, was entertaining a group of friends
and gossips. The coming of the Commissaire created a fresh
thrill.</p>

<p>"It is you who are the proprietress of this house, Madame?"
the Commissaire enquired.</p>

<p>The woman acknowledged the fact.</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Commissaire can ask me any questions," she
invited. "He was a silent man, that Legarge, but he spoke
sometimes."</p>

<p>"First of all," the official announced, "I wish to examine his
room. I have the key here."</p>

<p>The woman rose to her feet and pointed up the stairs.</p>

<p>"It was a habit of his," she confided, "to lock always his
door when he went out&mdash;honest people though we are. The door
faces you at the corner of the banisters."</p>

<p>The Commissaire mounted, followed by the gendarme. The steps
were of stone and the house was of great age. The gendarme fitted
the key in the lock and pushed open the heavy oak door. The room
was in darkness, but electric light was plentiful in St. Paul,
and the gendarme soon found the switch. A cry of amazement broke
from the lips of both men almost simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Now, who the devil has been here?" the Commissaire
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"<i>Nom de Dieu!</i>" the gendarme cried.</p>

<p>The room was in wild disorder. Every drawer in a chest had
been turned out and its contents emptied. A despatch box had been
broken open and a collection of unimportant trifles scattered
over the table.</p>

<p>"Touch nothing," the Commissaire ordered.</p>

<p>He called in Madame. With uplifted hands she screamed out her
amazement. The Commissaire had a way with women and he silenced
her quickly.</p>

<p>"It would appear to be impossible to enter this room without a
key," he said. "Are there any except the one which I found in the
dead man's pocket and have just used?"</p>

<p>"There is another," Madame acknowledged.</p>

<p>"Where is it then?"</p>

<p>The woman hesitated, but there were few people who would have
cared to lie to her fierce questioner.</p>

<p>"There is a young lady who dances here," she confided. "I do
not think that she has often made use of it, but one night I saw
Monsieur give her his spare key."</p>

<p>"For the moment that will do," the Commissaire observed,
feeling that he was getting on very nicely. "Leave us."</p>

<p>The search of the apartment and of the belongings of the
murdered man revealed nothing of interest. His wearing apparel
and linen, ordinary enough, had apparently been bought in
Marseilles. There was not the slightest indication to be gathered
from any of the objects displayed as to his position in life, his
poverty or his wealth. If he were indeed a foreigner, he appeared
to possess no passport. There were a few hundred francs in a
shabby pocketbook and a letter directed to "Dear Paul" and signed
only "Max" with no address on it, begging for the loan of a
mille. Whatever Monsieur Legarge had possessed of value had
gone!</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door. The gendarme opened it. One of
the young painters of the place&mdash;the one who had already
spoken of his brief acquaintance with the murdered man&mdash;made
tentative appearance.</p>

<p>"There is a thing here which might interest you, Monsieur le
Commissaire," he said politely, as he glanced around the room.
"Ah yes, I see that I was right. Tell me, Monsieur&mdash;you are
a judge of art without a doubt&mdash;what you think of the dead
man's genius?"</p>

<p>There was a row of paintings ranged against the wall, one half
finished upon an easel. The Commissaire examined them
superficially.</p>

<p>"I do not know why you intrude with your question," he said
gruffly, "but the work is passable. I am not an artist, but I
should say that the young man had learnt his trade."</p>

<p>"The fact that the paintings are here at all," the other
replied, "is a proof that he had not. Every one of those
canvases, including the unfinished one, he bought from me. You
can see, if you look closely, where my name has been scratched
out."</p>

<p>"You mean that they are your work?" the Commissaire
demanded.</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"But is such a thing usual that one artist should buy the work
of another?"</p>

<p>"Within my knowledge," the young painter declared, "such a
thing has never happened before. Yet that is what has occurred.
Legarge came to me with a story about an uncle who might come to
see his work and if he found nothing would stop his allowance. He
had plenty of money at the time. He asked me to sell him some
pictures. I sold him these and he dragged one I was halfway
through from my easel."</p>

<p>"It is incredible," the police functionary exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yet it is true," the other affirmed. "Voil&agrave;, Monsieur
le Commissaire, your murdered man may have been anything in the
world, but he was no artist. He couldn't draw a line, neither
could he paint."</p>

<p>The Commissaire stood with folded arms, staring out of the
window across the crazy street to the hills beyond. He might have
been posing for a study of a great man in thought.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">COMMODORE JASEN laid down the fishing tackle
which he had been stretching out upon the billiard table, removed
his pipe from his mouth and glanced at the card which was handed
to him soon after nine o'clock on the following morning.</p><br>

<p class="cp"><span class="smcap">Monsieur Georges<br>
Commissaire de Police.</span></p><br>

<p>"Show the gentleman in at once," he directed. "Always pays to
be civil to the police," he added to Jake Arnott, who was
lounging in a chair at the farther end of the room.</p>

<p>There was a lightning-like flash from the other's eyes.</p>

<p>"What the hell do the police want here?" he muttered under his
breath.</p>

<p>"So far, I haven't an idea," the Commodore replied coolly.
"Together we'll hear what the gentleman has to say."</p>

<p>The Commissaire was ushered in. The Commodore welcomed him
pleasantly and pointed to a chair.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, sir?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"I am engaged in investigating an unfortunate affair which
occurred up at St. Paul last night," the Commissaire explained.
"You have no doubt heard about it. I understand that a young lady
named Mademoiselle Adams&mdash;one of the dancers, in fact, at
the small cabaret there&mdash;is staying with you. I should like
a few words with her."</p>

<p>"By all means," Commodore Jasen assented, leaning over towards
the bell and pressing the knob. "I cannot say that the young lady
is exactly staying with me, but she, with a friend and an elderly
lady who acts as chaperone, are my guests in the annex here."</p>

<p>The butler presented himself, always the same&mdash;sombre,
taciturn&mdash;with an air of great reserve.</p>

<p>"Find Miss Adams, if she's not gone out to bathe," his master
instructed, "and ask her to come here for a few minutes. If she
is not in the place, you'd better go down to the bathing
pool."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir."</p>

<p>"May I ask," the Commissaire continued, as the man left the
room, "whether it is under your auspices, Commodore, that these
two young ladies have started this cabaret entertainment up at
St. Paul?"</p>

<p>Jasen pushed the cigar box toward his guest who, however,
declined the civility. The former considered his reply for
several moments.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know that I can exactly say that it was under
my auspices," he said at last, with some deliberation. "I invited
the young ladies to come here to entertain my guests in the
evenings, expecting to have a much larger house party, but that
unfortunate accident a short time ago&mdash;I daresay you
remember that a young man staying at the hotel was drowned whilst
aquaplaning with us&mdash;was rather a shock to us all, and I
have not been entertaining as much as I expected. The girls
wanted to do something, as they are both very talented, so they
tried this scheme up at St. Paul."</p>

<p>"Was there a performance last night, can you tell me?"</p>

<p>"Fortunately, no."</p>

<p>"Then neither of the young ladies was up at St. Paul?" the
Commissaire continued.</p>

<p>The door was suddenly opened and Miss Zo&euml; Adams, in loose
pyjamas with very wide legs, a little cap on the side of her head
which only partially concealed her very attractive yellow hair,
came gaily into the room. She threw a kiss at Arnott and looked
at the Commissaire as though he were some sort of natural
curiosity.</p>

<p>"Here is the young lady herself," Commodore Jasen observed, by
way of introduction. "She can answer your questions better
perhaps than I can. This is the Commissaire of Police, Zo&euml;,"
he continued. "You must tell him anything he wants to know."</p>

<p>She threw herself into a chair and withdrew her cigarette from
her lips. To any one but the closest observer her deportment was
both natural and indifferent. The lines of her tight little
mouth, however, were drawn close together and, underneath her
slightly questioning frown, her small shrewd eyes were filled
with a cautious light.</p>

<p>"Shoot," she invited briefly.</p>

<p>"The young lady speaks French?" the Commissaire asked.</p>

<p>"Eloquently, but with a ferocious accent," the Commodore
assured him. "Her mother was a Ni&ccedil;oise."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; made a grimace at her patron. The police official
asked his questions in French which was eloquently suggestive of
his local birth.</p>

<p>"You were acquainted with Monsieur Paul Legarge who was
murdered last night at the Pomme d'Or?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew him," the girl answered.</p>

<p>"When did you know that he had been murdered?"</p>

<p>"When every one else in the house did, I suppose&mdash;at the
time of the <i>petit d&eacute;jeuner</i> this morning."</p>

<p>"Where and how did you meet him?"</p>

<p>"I never met him, if you mean by that introductions and that
sort of thing," the girl replied carelessly. "In my profession,
Monsieur le Commissaire, if a member of our small audience
compliments us upon our dancing civilly and says pleasant things,
the acquaintance is made."</p>

<p>"It was in such fashion that you met Legarge?"</p>

<p>"Precisely. On the night he spoke to us, he took my friend and
myself and Madame Ferber, who goes with us every night when we
dance at St. Paul or Vence, to the Pomme d'Or for a drink after
the show. I remember thinking," she went on, "that he seemed more
opulent than any of the painters I had ever met, for he gave us
champagne."</p>

<p>"Since then you have seen him how often?"</p>

<p>"I do not keep a diary," she replied. "Half a dozen to a dozen
times, perhaps. He was quite agreeable."</p>

<p>"Of what nationality was he?" the Commissaire asked.</p>

<p>She looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>"Is it possible that you are ignorant of that? American, of
course."</p>

<p>"Did you admire his skill as a painter?"</p>

<p>"Some of the things in his room seemed pretty good," was the
indifferent rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Do you believe them to be his own work?"</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"Why did you have a key to his room?" the Commissaire asked,
with a sudden change of subject.</p>

<p>The girl looked at him with upraised eyebrows.</p>

<p>"You are indeed inquisitive," she remarked. "Well, I am good-
natured. I will tell you. Probably not for the reason you think.
We give our show in two parts and there is nowhere to rest in the
barn. Paul gave me the key to his room so that I could go in and
sit there if I wanted to be alone between the performances."</p>

<p>"Was Paul Legarge your lover?" the Commissaire demanded.</p>

<p>"Mind your own business," the girl replied promptly.</p>

<p>For the first time, to judge from his set and gloomy features,
it might have been the first time in his life, the Commissaire
smiled.</p>

<p>"You decline to answer that question, Mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do."</p>

<p>"Now, think before you answer this one. Were you in Legarge's
room last night?"</p>

<p>"I do not need to think," was the prompt rejoinder. "I was
not. Apparently the poor fellow was not there himself after
dinner."</p>

<p>"Were you in St. Paul?"</p>

<p>"I was not. Ask the Commodore. Ask any one. There was no
performance last night. I dined here. Afterwards we sang songs.
You do not need to take my word. You can ask any one."</p>

<p>The Commissaire was disappointed.</p>

<p>"Do you know of any one else who has a key to the murdered
man's room?"</p>

<p>"I do not. It is difficult to imagine that there would be more
than two. He kept one himself and the other is at the present
moment in my room."</p>

<p>The Commissaire frowned and pulled at his under lip.</p>

<p>"If the young lady's word," Commodore Jasen intervened,
"should need any confirmation, I can assure you as to the truth
of what she has told you. She dined here with her young
companion, Mr. Wilson, a neighbour of ours, and myself. We had
quite a pleasant little evening's music. Certainly the young
ladies were not out of our sight until long after the murder had
taken place."</p>

<p>The official thought of that ransacked room, remembered the
key which had been found in the murdered man's pocket, and
abstained from speech. The Commodore glanced at him
deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"There is no reason, Monsieur," he pointed out, "for you to
take the young lady's word, or even mine. If we two are not to be
believed, the butler who waited upon us, the chef who cooked the
dinner, the second man who served the coffee and liqueurs, are
all here and at your disposal. Mr. Wilson you will know yourself
where to find. It can be abundantly proved," he concluded, "that
the two young ladies dined here and did not leave these premises
until after midnight. We were inclined to be light-hearted last
night. I think it must have been half-past twelve before we broke
off."</p>

<p>The Commissaire listened in stony silence, saluted stiffly and
turned away.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle is not leaving the neighbourhood?" he enquired,
as he waited at the door for the servant whom his host had
summoned.</p>

<p>"You bet I'm not," the young lady assured him. "I beg your
pardon," she added, repeating her intentions in French. "So long
as the bathing remains good and the Commodore is agreeable, this
is my home."</p>

<p>The butler threw open the door. The uninvited visitor took
conventional but ungracious leave. The Commodore resumed the
unravelling of his fishing line.</p>

<p>"A type," he murmured.</p>

<p class="first">THE inky black cloud which had thrown its
protecting gloom over the murderer of the Pomme d'Or the night
before had not crawled across the sky for nothing. The flawless
serenity of the long spell of summer weather seemed at last to be
disturbed. The Commissaire took his departure from the
Ch&acirc;teau to the salute of rolling mutterings of thunder, and
down at the Cap the bathing beaches were deserted. Commodore
Jasen, after a brief visit to the terrace, abandoned his plans
for a day's fishing with a sigh and considered the matter of a
visit to Monte Carlo. Before he could make up his mind, however,
another visitor was announced. Caroline Loyd, a little breathless
from her scramble over the rocks, was ushered in. For a moment
the two men were speechless. Then Commodore Jasen, with a smile
of welcome, stepped forward and raised his visitor's fingers to
his lips.</p>

<p>"Our friend the enemy," he murmured. "Welcome, dear Caroline.
It is not often you favour us like this."</p>

<p>She nodded to Arnott and accepted a chair. She was wearing a
white pullover, a white cap of the b&eacute;ret type and a linen
skirt. The shine and odour of the sea still lingered with
her.</p>

<p>"Ostensibly," she remarked, "the reason for my visit is
because there will be no more bathing at the Cap to-day.
Incidentally, however, I have come to have a very serious word
with you both."</p>

<p>Jake Arnott strolled across the room and sat on the edge of
the billiard table close to his host. Caroline watched
sympathetically his glance towards the closed door.</p>

<p>"I have always the same feeling about this Ch&acirc;teau of
yours, Commodore," she confided. "It seems full of corners and
odd places. A perfect Paradise for eavesdroppers, I should
think."</p>

<p>The Commodore nodded.</p>

<p>"Come this way," he invited. "I approve and I agree. There is
not an indoor servant in this place who does not belong to us and
who has not been thoroughly tested, but the police have been here
this morning already, and one never knows."</p>

<p>He led the way to a small room which opened out from the
larger apartment and closed the door carefully. The windows here
were of the ordinary type and there was no outside terrace. The
walls were lined with bookshelves.</p>

<p>"This," he pointed out, "is more <i>intime</i>. May I commence
by asking you a question?"</p>

<p>"Just as you like," she assented.</p>

<p>"How did you get to know that Pullertons had sent a man over
here?"</p>

<p>She looked at him steadily for a moment.</p>

<p>"How did you?" she countered.</p>

<p>The Commodore frowned.</p>

<p>"Caroline Loyd," he said earnestly, "in a matter like the one
with which we are concerned at the moment, it is necessary that
there should be complete confidence between us, because we are
equally threatened. I will give you a lead if you will permit me.
Last night a man posing as an artist and calling himself Paul
Legarge was killed up at St. Paul. My little Zo&euml;, who is one
of the brightest children that ever fooled the world, had been
suspicious of him from the first. An hour before he was killed,
she had searched his room and discovered, in a secret hiding
place, his badge and the envelope of a letter which he had
received only that morning from Police Headquarters in New
York."</p>

<p>Caroline Loyd's eyes were troubled. Her manner lost something
of its serenity.</p>

<p>"I thought it must be that," she murmured. "But, Commodore,
aren't you bringing the extreme measures of Chicago and New York
into a country where they are barely necessary? One might at
least have had an explanation with this man Legarge. One might
have bought him, or if he wouldn't talk reason, after all he
could only cramp your style a little. The only one of us who was
liable for extradition, so far as we know, was poor Ned, and he's
gone."</p>

<p>The two men were equally and genuinely puzzled. There was no
doubt that their visitor was speaking in all sincerity. Jake
Arnott had paused in the act of filling a pipe and looked towards
his partner for enlightenment. He found none. The Commodore was
also seeking for understanding.</p>

<p>"Look here, Caroline," he said, "we don't need any dope from
you. You hate us like hell, I know that, but you will play the
game. What we want to know&mdash;Jake and I&mdash;is what have
you got to complain of? The man was just as likely to have been
after you as us."</p>

<p>"The man ought to have had a chance," Caroline declared
coldly. "I never cared about this promiscuous killing. You know
that. So long as you had him marked down, he could never have got
away."</p>

<p>Jake Arnott suddenly stiffened; the lines in his face seemed
to grow deeper.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, "let's have this straight between the
three of us. Caroline Loyd, do you think that I or any one of our
gang bumped off that man last night?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do," she replied.</p>

<p>The Commodore shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>"Chuck that, Jake," he begged. "It isn't worth while with
Caroline."</p>

<p>"Chuck it be damned!" was the fierce reply. "We're great on
alibis round here; in fact, we have built up our safety on them,
but I don't need one this time. I was down at the Casino at Juan
from dinner time till three o'clock this morning. I never went
near St. Paul. If this guy Legarge was done in by any one of our
crowd, it was without my knowledge."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen relapsed slowly into an easy-chair. The power
of speech appeared to have left him. Caroline stared at Arnott
with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>"Damn it all," the latter went on, "there were a dozen people
there saw me dining, and a whole table full of people with whom I
played 'chemie.' There is not any one else on this outfit who
would have tackled the man except myself, unless they had orders.
I should have had him this week sure, but I was waiting for his
next advices from New York. That's the solid truth. Some one got
in ahead of me."</p>

<p>Caroline pointed to the Commodore.</p>

<p>"How is it that he doesn't believe you?" she asked.</p>

<p>The Commodore pulled himself together.</p>

<p>"I believe him if he says so," he declared. "Jake's never told
me a lie. They don't pay in our profession."</p>

<p>"But you must have talked it over since last night," Caroline
objected. "What I mean is, that if Jake was dumb, you must have
asked him questions."</p>

<p>"That's just what we didn't do and never have done," Jasen
pointed out quickly. "A clean job like that is never mentioned. I
am not supposed to know what my men do. I ask for no report and
none is ever made to me unless there is a necessity. I knew that
Jake was out all night, but I thought that he was covering up his
tracks after St. Paul."</p>

<p>Caroline looked across towards the man standing by the
mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"If you didn't kill Legarge, who do you think did, then?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Why, one of your men, of course," was the confident reply. "I
saw that little chap of yours who looks like a Frenchman, up at
St. Paul the other day, and I never doubted but that he was on
Legarge's track too. When I heard the news this morning, well, I
rather thought that you had found your nerve again. That's all
there was to it."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen sat forward in his chair.</p>

<p>"This is a serious and is becoming an alarming affair," he
pointed out. "Let us have it, as it were, in black and white. Not
one of us three is fool enough to tell lies; besides, it's not
done in our world. Jake, you spent the night at Juan Casino, you
never went to St. Paul, you didn't push that knife into the New
Yorker?"</p>

<p>"My word's good enough, Commodore," was the prompt reply. "I
never set foot in St. Paul last night, nor dreamt of going there,
and I have never set eyes on the man. As you know, it was pretty
well understood between us that he had to be given his ticket,
but I shouldn't have chosen a public place like that. You believe
me, Caroline?"</p>

<p>"I must," she answered.</p>

<p>"So do I," the Commodore decided. "Now, listen here, Caroline.
What about Ralph Joslin? He would be just the sort of fellow not
to let on to you so that you should be kept clear."</p>

<p>"Ralph was with me from half-past seven last evening until
after midnight," Caroline affirmed. "As a matter of fact, we went
over to Palm Beach Casino."</p>

<p>"There we are then," the Commodore said, lighting a cigarette.
"Some one else has done our job for us. It's uncanny. I don't
like the feeling."</p>

<p>"Damned if I do either," Jake Arnott muttered.</p>

<p>Caroline glanced from one to the other in some distress.</p>

<p>"I think it's terrible," she declared.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE Commissaire of Police sat in his office,
biting his nails. Never had there been a case so full of
possibilities, never one in which a swift and prompt solution
would bring such credit upon his office. Yet up till that moment,
though all manner of strange happenings were connected with the
affair, not one of them seemed to lead to a definite clue. His
assistant disturbed his not too pleasant meditations.</p>

<p>"Gentleman to see you, sir," he announced. "It is the Monsieur
from the Ch&acirc;teau d'Antibes."</p>

<p>The owner, even if he were only a temporary owner, of the
great house of the neighbourhood, was deserving of consideration.
The Commissaire shook hands with him once more when he was
ushered in.</p>

<p>"I beg," Commodore Jasen said courteously, as he accepted a
chair, "that you will not consider me in any way officious, but
on thinking over your visit this morning and some of the details
of this terrible affair in St. Paul, I am emboldened to offer you
a suggestion. It is an idea which occurred to me, I must confess,
only half an hour ago. I ordered a car and came at once to see
you. I may say that if it should help you, I desire neither
thanks nor credit. I pass on the idea to you&mdash;a free
gift."</p>

<p>"I will hear it," the Commissaire, very much to his future
benefit, conceded.</p>

<p>A night of inky, sulphurous blackness, low-hanging clouds,
immovable, leaning menacingly from the sky. Every table at the
Pomme d'Or was occupied, notwithstanding the tragedy of the
previous night and although it was unusual to dine out of doors
under such unpromising conditions. The shaded lights had been
reinforced, but even then there were pools of darkness in many
places. Conversation everywhere was restrained and scanty.
Laughter was a thing unheard. Upon the spirits of every one there
seemed to rest the memory of the recent tragedy. In a way it was
a gruesome scene, the more gruesome because seated at the table
under the tree, the light upon his table the feeblest of all, was
a man dining alone in a claret-coloured shirt and blue trousers.
There was something almost ghoulish about the highly charged
atmosphere, the spasmodic conversation, the silences, the air of
impending tragedy. One woman found it too much for her nerves and
was led out, sobbing. Her place, however, was speedily taken by
another. It was a feast of drama that night for the guests of the
Pomme d'Or.</p>

<p>At a table under the inner wall three men were seated
together. Commodore Jasen was one, the Commissaire was another,
and Jake Arnott the third. They had champagne in their glasses
and food was placed occasionally on their plates by the stealthy-
footed, subdued waiter. No one ate much that night, however. They
were waiting for a signal which seemed slow in coming.</p>

<p>Monsieur Canis emerged from his secret lurking-place and stole
like a ghost amongst his guests. The Commissaire summoned him. A
big spot of rain had fallen. There was fear of more.</p>

<p>"He is there?"</p>

<p>"He watches all the time," Monsieur Canis answered, with a
shiver.</p>

<p>"Let it be now," the Commissaire directed, and even his voice
shook perceptibly.</p>

<p>The figure of the proprietor faded into the shadows. Suddenly
there came what all had been warned to expect, but all had
dreaded. The lights on every table went out.</p>

<p>"Such darkness," the police functionary muttered. "I never
would have believed it possible. One can understand now."</p>

<p>The maid went by, sobbing with hysterical fright, keeping far
away from the table by the tree, carrying a candle in her hand,
which flickered out before she had taken very many steps. There
was a low murmur of voices through the blackness. Here and there
a white face was visible where some one had struck a match.
Suddenly the <i>Commissaire</i> leaped to his feet. There was a
shout from the table under the tree. The seated figure there had
leaped to one side. There was a confused vision of men
struggling, a cry that rang through the whole place, down the
hillside and along the valleys.... The lights went on again. On
the ground by the side of the table under the tree a white-faced
man with a scraggy beard lay struggling with three gendarmes, the
handcuffs already upon his wrists, a knife by his side. Over him
stood the <i>Commissaire</i>.</p>

<p>"Jaques Courdon," he challenged, "it was you who killed the
American artist at this table last night."</p>

<p>"I thought," came a pitiful voice, "that he was here again to-
night."</p>

<p>"You came with the same idea in your mind?"</p>

<p>The Commissaire repeated his question, his shrill voice
echoing portentously through the courtyard. The figure on the
ground rocked helplessly from side to side.</p>

<p>"I thought I had killed him last night," he moaned. "I saw her
steal away from his rooms and I came here to kill him. I came up
the ramparts&mdash;I dropped over into the darkness and I thought
I had killed him&mdash;and to-night some one brought me to the
gate and pointed, and he was there in the same place! It must
have been a dream!"</p>

<p>They hurried the man away. The Commissaire shook hands with
many of the friends who had come to his aid&mdash;supers in a
very ghastly show.</p>

<p>"Of all the reconstructions the history of the criminal world
has ever known," the <i>avocat</i> from Nice told him, "yours,
Monsieur Georges, has been the most wonderful. My
congratulations. Many people shall know of this."</p>

<p>The Commissaire flushed with gratified pride, but he glanced
furtively at Commodore Jasen. Commodore Jasen, however, was the
second to congratulate him.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">"THAT I should have lived to see the day,"
Caroline Loyd murmured, as they drove down the hill, "when my
friend Commodore Jasen would lend his aid to the Law!"</p>

<p>"There were reasons," the latter explained. "I saw at once
that if ever gossip stirred about the tenants of the
Ch&acirc;teau&mdash;or the lady at the Cap&mdash;this
undiscovered crime would count against us. I came up here and
made a few enquiries. I heard of this poor wretch&mdash;the Mad
Baker they call him&mdash;who lives here on sufferance amongst a
good-hearted set of neighbours. In common with every one else,
the people who keep the barn had been kind to him and he had a
free seat every night my two young prot&eacute;g&eacute;es
danced. It was cruel perhaps to be amused, but many people were
amused at his outrageous infatuation. He would sit without
stirring during the whole performance, his eyes hungering after
little Zo&euml; every moment she was on the stage. He would
trudge down the hill after her till she was in her car. Once or
twice she had thrown him a kind word. Sometimes a kind word is
fuel to madness.... Zo&euml;, of course, supplied the idea. One
night when she had dined with this fellow Legarge, she had seen
the lunatic hiding in the shrubs below, looking at their table
and at her companion with murder in his eyes. She said nothing
for fear of getting him into trouble, but her recollection of the
incident was opportune. For the rest, it seemed easy enough. The
only trouble about our little show was&mdash;even if the night
were dark, would he come again if he saw a figure at the table
like the figure of the night before? That idea, I will admit, we
put into his mind. A gamble, surely a gamble.
<i>Enfin</i>&mdash;I have made the reputation of the
<i>Commissaire</i> for life."</p>

<p>"It is a very sound asset," Jake Arnott remarked, "to have
friends amongst the police."</p>

<h2><a id="story3" name="story3">III.&mdash;FIFTY-FIFTY</a></h2>

<h3>Published in <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i>, Feb 1932</h3>

<p class="first">THE croupier, who liked to get on with the game,
looked ingratiatingly round at the little company of players at
the <i>chemin de fer</i> table.</p>

<p>"<i>Un banco de cinq mille</i>," he announced. "<i>Qui fait le
banco?</i>"</p>

<p>There was no response. About a quarter of the amount was
grudgingly subscribed. The croupier appealed to the on-
lookers.</p>

<p>"<i>Un banco de cinq mille</i>," he announced once more in
parrot-like tones. "<i>Qui fait le banco?</i>"</p>

<p>Caroline, with the shoe in her hand, glanced indifferently
around. She was not a great gambler. It was the third round and
she was half inclined to take in the hand. Then she caught the
eye of her shabby, but aristocratic-looking vis-&agrave;-vis,
with whom she had already exchanged a few courteous amenities.
Perhaps he took her enquiring glance, the faint quiver of her
adorable lips, as a challenge. The fingers of his long white
hand, which were resting upon the table, trembled, and a slight
flush crept into his pallid cheeks. Five mille was a great deal
of money. Nothing, alas, to this rich new crowd, who were pushing
the world upon one side, but a great deal of money to the Marquis
de St. V&eacute;ran, whose great-great-grandfather had owned the
site upon which the Casino was built and all the land between the
sea and the hills. Nevertheless, he felt that the adorable young
American lady had challenged him.</p>

<p>"<i>Banco</i>," he said.</p>

<p>Even then Caroline hesitated. She had a very sure instinct in
human relations, and something told her that five mille was more
than her opponent could afford and that his bet was a gesture
incited by her simple glance of enquiry. Once more she was almost
inclined to take in the hand, but his fingers already
outstretched for the cards, the composure of his face and manner,
changed her idea. He might think that she guessed his poverty. He
might, on the other hand, be wealthy, notwithstanding his
slightly worn linen, the marks of pressing upon his admirably
arranged cravat, the shine upon the lapels of his dinner coat.
She decided not to risk hurting him and she gave the cards. The
Marquis accepted them without undue haste. He glanced at them
and, despite his almost icy self-possession, there was a faint
glitter in his eyes. He turned them over and displayed a natural
eight. With a little shrug of the shoulders, Caroline threw down
her own. There was a murmur around the table. To the non-players
it was just a piece of hard luck which lent a thrill to the game.
Caroline had exposed a natural nine!... The loser looked at the
cards steadily and the glitter faded from his eyes. There was no
other sign, however, of emotion. He bowed his congratulations,
counted out the two mille worth of counters in front of him and
turned to the man at the desk.</p>

<p>"<i>Donnez-moi trois mille, Monsieur</i>," he directed.</p>

<p>The official showed a curious hesitation. He looked as though
about to grope in his drawer. He whispered rapidly in the ear of
an overseer standing by. There was a brief colloquy. He was not a
bad fellow, but it was more than he dared do to disobey
orders.</p>

<p>"If Monsieur le Marquis would apply at the desk," he suggested
respectfully.</p>

<p>"You have not three mille?"</p>

<p>"One regrets, Monsieur le Marquis."</p>

<p>Caroline bit her lip. She felt that she could have bitten it
through for giving the hand. Her first instinct had been correct.
The Marquis rose to his feet and leant for a moment on his heavy
stick. He bowed slightly to Caroline.</p>

<p>"I regret this momentary delay," he apologised. "I will return
immediately."</p>

<p>He walked towards the distant counter with its brass rail and
white-faced, mechanical-looking cashiers, dealing out mille notes
with Robot-like indifference. Caroline had an inspiration. She
threw three mille plaques into the bank.</p>

<p>"There is no need to delay the game," she said. "I will take
the money from the gentleman when he returns. I pass the
hand."</p>

<p>Every one was relieved at not having to wait. The affair of
the <i>cagnotte</i> was speedily arranged and the money passed
over to Caroline. She threw back a generous <i>pourboire</i> and
dropped the remainder into her bag. She glanced over her shoulder
and felt a queer shiver of sympathy. Before the desk the Marquis,
leaning slightly upon his stick and gesticulating with his free
hand, was talking to the indifferent-looking clerk and one of the
managers. No mille notes were in evidence and the attitude of the
two officials, although respectful enough, was uncompromising.
Caroline acted upon a sudden inspiration. She marked her place,
rose to her feet and made her way into the deserted bar behind.
She threw herself into an easy-chair in a distant corner and lit
a cigarette.</p>

<p>"<i>Madame prendra quelque chose?</i>" the barman invited,
with a courteous little bow.</p>

<p>"<i>Tout &agrave; l'heure</i>," she replied.</p>

<p>Her instinct was correct. From the window she watched the
Marquis, very pale save for one angry spot of colour on his
cheek, return to his place, whisper to the valet as he noted her
empty seat and come to the bar. He mounted the steps and made his
way towards her. She made room for him by her side.</p>

<p>"Let us forget that silly game," she begged. "Come and talk to
me for a while."</p>

<p>She saw his fine mouth quiver as he sank into the chair.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," he said, "I have a confession to make to you.
I owe the authorities here a little, a very little money. They
think that it is enough. They do not wish to advance me three
mille."</p>

<p>She laughed softly.</p>

<p>"How silly!" she exclaimed. "As though it mattered. As a
matter of fact, I paid it and took the bank in. It was greedy of
me, perhaps, but I wanted a rest. I wonder whether you would care
to offer me an orangeade? The three mille will do next time we
meet here."</p>

<p>The Marquis gave the order at the counter. He drew from a
slim, worn pocketbook a card and laid it upon the table.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," he begged, "you will be so kind as to tell me
your name. I am the Marquis de St. V&eacute;ran, and I live at
the Ch&acirc;teau de St. V&eacute;ran on the hill beyond
Mougins."</p>

<p>"My name is Caroline Loyd," she confided. "I am staying at the
Cap d'Antibes H&ocirc;tel. As you can perhaps tell from my
accent, I am an American, and as I have neither husband nor
brother, nor any one there who knows anything about me, they are
beginning to think that I must be an adventuress."</p>

<p>The waiter served her with an orangeade and handed a
<i>fine</i> to the Marquis. The latter's fingers were still
trembling as he raised the glass to his lips, but he was full of
gratitude to this beautiful young woman who had smoothed away his
humiliation. He was not as a rule attracted by the tourists who
flocked to Juan. The pyjama-clad woman at night filled him with
horror. He loved the precise ways of the older generations.
Caroline, in her black gown, her not too sunburnt neck and arms,
her kindly expression and softly modulated voice, pleased him,
apart from her actual beauty, as no other woman had done for
years. She might be, as she had confided, an American, but she
might also have stepped from one of the frames of the pictures
hanging in the long gallery at St. V&eacute;ran.</p>

<p>"All men and women in life are better for the spirit of
adventure," he said. "I myself possessed it once. I had a great
scheme for reclaiming some of my lands, but the War came and they
allowed even me to fight, because my family had been famous as
soldiers. Hence my foot and my infirmity, for which, however, I
can claim little sympathy, as it improves every day. Tell me,
Mademoiselle, if you will, where you learned to speak French with
so pleasant an accent."</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"Not in France, alas," she confessed. "I was educated at a
convent in New Orleans. Several of the Sisters were French. I try
to speak correctly, but it is years since I was in this
country.... The other day," she went on, "I passed your
Ch&acirc;teau, Marquis. I think it is one of the most beautiful
buildings I have ever seen."</p>

<p>The Marquis inclined his head. It was praise he loved to hear,
but it brought with it a certain sadness.</p>

<p>"It is, alas," he regretted, "only a shell, but if you would,
Mademoiselle, you can add to the very great kindness you have
already shown me. I am a middle-aged, almost an elderly man, or I
would not ask such a favour, but if you would lunch with me to-
morrow&mdash;the next day if to-morrow is inconvenient&mdash;and
be content with very simple fare, I will show you all that there
is left to show of my home, which is little enough, save for a
few pictures and some very beautiful studies in architecture. I
shall have the pleasure too of discharging my debt at the same
time."</p>

<p>"Nothing would give me greater pleasure," she assured him.
"About half-past twelve?"</p>

<p>"At that time," he said, rising to his feet, "my gates, which
are usually inhospitably locked, will be thrown open and I shall
be awaiting your arrival. I must not detain you now from your
game. Needless to say, I shall not play again."</p>

<p>She understood and she took her leave. The Marquis resumed his
seat and toyed with his liqueur glass. His eyes were set, and he
was still suffering from the humiliation to which he had been
subjected. He looked through the walls and dreamed, for a few
bitter moments, of the years before the Casino had been built,
when the waves came tumbling in upon an empty beach, and when, at
the sight of a Lord of St. V&eacute;ran, any passer-by would have
curtseyed or doffed his hat.</p>

<p>All the time, from outside, came the parrot-like calls of the
croupiers, the eager voices of a common, cosmopolitan and, as
they seemed to him, an indecently clad, grotesque crowd. The
world had changed!</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">CAROLINE felt herself somehow a garish and
meretricious fragment of the new vulgarity which had fallen like
a pest upon the earth, as, in her forty-horse-power Hispano-
Suiza, with its silver fittings and highly polished body, she
swept through the gates of St. V&eacute;ran to pay her promised
visit. On either side of the lodge houses, which were practically
in ruins, were carved in now decayed masonry the St. V&eacute;ran
arms. The woman who had admitted her, and who stood with one
lean, quivering hand upon the gate, seemed as though she belonged
to a world long finished with. On either side of the rough road,
what had evidently once been a park was waste land, here and
there planted with vines. There were treeless spaces where once a
forest had been. Small white plastered houses with green roofs,
stark and ungracious, were dotted about the bare hillside, with
their strip of vineyard, and occasionally a more gracious expanse
of flower-growing land. There was a sawmill buzzing by the side
of a stream. A grim and merciless utilitarianism had gripped the
fair lands of St. V&eacute;ran. Only the Ch&acirc;teau itself,
with its rounded walls, its weather-stained, well-defined
minarets and tower, remained untouched, brooding gloomily over
the desecration by which it was surrounded. Caroline shivered
almost with fear as her car, with its flamboyant expression of
opulence, rolled across the weed-grown square to the great front
doors. She felt it to be almost a consolation that the opulence
itself was in some measure a sham.</p>

<p>The Marquis stood ready to receive her upon the threshold. An
old servant had faded literally from behind him. The former moved
to hand his guest from the car and raised her fingers to his
lips.</p>

<p>"You are the first lady who has entered my home for years," he
said. "You are very welcome."</p>

<p>"I am very glad to come," she assured him. "If you knew how
tired one gets of hotels&mdash;doing the same thing, eating the
same food all the time. What a possession!</p>

<p>"It has been. It is still," he admitted, "a great house. It
was built in the fourteenth century. The world was very much
alive then. Architects, painters, sculptors were all crazy with
their thirst for beauty. I shall not talk about the lines of the
arch, for instance, or that ceiling, because I think you will
feel them. Pintorini designed the chapel. Nowadays curves like
that do not exist."</p>

<p>In a sense it was terrible. He led her through great, empty
rooms, beautiful in their proportions, but stripped bare of every
other attraction. Only in the long picture gallery there were
still, notwithstanding many empty places, a few pictures.</p>

<p>"Much of the St. V&eacute;ran collection," he told her, "was
destroyed during the Revolution. Many more pictures my ancestors
sold, not for themselves, but to aid others of our order less
fortunate. My brother and I&mdash;my brother who was head of the
family before myself and who is now dead&mdash;swore an oath that
no other picture should pass out of our possession, even though
we lived by eating the roots in our last field and drinking the
wine we make on what was once our lawn."</p>

<p>"But surely these pictures that are left," she began
hesitatingly&mdash;</p>

<p>"The portrait of a lady on your right there was painted by
Andrea del Sarto on his hurried way home after his visit to
Francis. Yes, I know what you are thinking. It would bring me
money, of course, but there is money that rather burns one's
fingers.... Now for something a little more cheerful! Here we
pass," he pointed out, opening a great French window, "on to our
southern terrace. You see, we lunch here," he went on, indicating
a small round table. "Below us to the sea the distance is seven
kilometres. Every square metre of that land once belonged to us.
Yet it seems that a little matter of three mille&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't," she begged him.</p>

<p>"You are right," he agreed. "Henri and I between us have
attempted the amazing enterprise of an <i>ap&eacute;ritif</i>. We
had no ice, but we have water as cold as ice itself from our
spring. We have laid our bottles in that. The vermouth is our
own. The other ingredients I shall not specify, but they are
produced on the estate."</p>

<p>From a richly chased glass Caroline drank the concoction,
delicately flavoured, fragrantly sweet, a potion which might have
been served by a lover to his mistress on St. Agnes' Eve, but the
headiness of which was lost with age. The Marquis handed her to
her place and the meal which followed was certainly a change from
the hotel fare to which she was accustomed. There was a freshly
caught trout with plain butter its only sauce, yet delicious; a
chicken, a poor thin affair, but with fresh salad; a bowl of
fruit and strangely tasting coffee. There was wine in priceless
decanters, but wine from which the flavour was passing or had
already passed. There were flowers upon the table in a bowl at
which Caroline looked so often that her host moved it closer to
her.</p>

<p>"The painting round the sides," he showed her, "is by Watteau.
The china at which you are looking&mdash;you like to know these
things?&mdash;is S&egrave;vres. It is pleasant to see it again.
Those rings for the napkins&mdash;an old-fashioned custom
that&mdash;are three hundred years old and of solid gold. Yes,"
he went on, with a quaint smile, "don't think that I am too
foolish about these things. I know, of course, that they are
worth a great deal of money. That thought only comes to me at
times and I banish it because it is an evil thought. The world
thinks of nothing but money nowadays. Well, I thank God that I am
content to go on until I am an old man and yet face the rest of
my days without it. One foolish thing I have done, and that was
because in the blood of every one of my forefathers has lurked
the passion for gambling. I have no friends left with whom to
pass my time, so I have tried my luck against this modern
Juggernaut&mdash;the artificial machines of chance. With what
lack of success you yourself have seen.... And now there comes a
horrible thought to me. I have denied myself tobacco so often
that I think nothing of it, but I remember now that the modern
lady smokes. I have not a cigarette to offer you."</p>

<p>She passed him a well-filled case.</p>

<p>"The modern woman is prepared for all contingencies," she
reminded him. "Please try these. They are not very good but they
are very mild."</p>

<p>They strolled to the edge of the terrace, where indeed the
view was marvellous. He pointed out the faint outline of the
Esterel.</p>

<p>"Always in the shadow," he told her. "Always a different
shade, from the most delicate of greys to the deepest of
purples."</p>

<p>They looked across at the islands in the smiling sea. There
was singularly little to be seen of the new outbreak of building
eastwards, for the corner of the hill stood out like a bluff.</p>

<p>"It is here I pass my days," he continued. "I have thirty or
forty books. I used to take my daily newspaper, but that I have
left off. It matters so little what happens. Are you fortified
with your simple lunch? Can you bear to hear bad news?"</p>

<p>"If you really have any to tell me," she assured him, "I think
I can bear it with equanimity."</p>

<p>"I cannot pay your three mille," he told her.</p>

<p>"Do you, who really are a person of detachments," she asked
him, "think that it matters?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it does matter," he answered. "I owe the Casino six. I
should have owed them three more but for their refusal last
night. I had intended to pay them with my quarter's rents from an
outside property, which should reach me to-morrow or the next
day. That is of no consequence. You have come for your three
mille and I cannot pay you, but I can do this, Mademoiselle, and
if you will humour me, it will make me very happy. Will you step
this way?"</p>

<p>They passed back into the great library, the shelves of which
were not only empty but crumbling to decay. In one corner was an
oaken chest, black and with the worm holes of genuine age. The
Marquis drew from his pocket a crooked key of ancient design and
fitted it into the lock.</p>

<p>"There are still some treasures left to the house," he sighed.
"When my time comes, the hungry dealers will find their way here,
and these things will go with the others. I know nothing of the
money value of the contents of this chest. I know this, however.
Whilst I live, its contents will be displayed in no shop windows.
Will you choose something, please, and take it instead of the
money I cannot pay you? Choose something which will be worth
while, if you wish to gratify me. The brocade you are handling
belonged to one of the ladies of Marie Antoinette's court, a St.
V&eacute;ran who had married a Duc de Montmorency. There is a
bundle of lace there. I know nothing of it. It may interest you.
It has a history, I believe. Then in that box&mdash;that little
coffer&mdash;that is really rather wonderful paste. Those buckles
once belonged to Marie Antoinette."</p>

<p>Caroline was speechless. Her fingers were passing reverently
over treasures more beautiful than she had ever seen.</p>

<p>"There is nothing here which I can take," she declared. "There
is nothing which I can disturb."</p>

<p>He leaned upon his stick and looked at her with kindly eyes.
The hard lines had left his mouth. He seemed suddenly to have
become once more a young man.</p>

<p>"You must please do as you are bidden," he begged. "I shall
leave you to yourself. I shall stroll upon the terrace."</p>

<p>He passed out and left her alone. Caroline leaned back in the
chair which he had dragged up for her and indulged in a shivering
travesty of a laugh. If only he had known! She had even stooped
once&mdash;more than once, perhaps&mdash;to what was little
better than ordinary theft and she knew something about valuable
things. There was more than enough here to pay her debt a
thousand times over. She began her search for something less
valuable than the articles he had disclosed to her, and, groping
into the recesses of the box, she dragged up an old parchment.
She read its quaint French, word by word. Presently she became
interested. She was still studying it, unconscious of the flight
of time, when the Marquis returned.</p>

<p>"Well," he asked, "have you chosen?"</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about this?" she enquired, handing him
the deed.</p>

<p>He took it into his hand and glanced it through.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," he confessed. "The old French is
interesting. The lawyers in Paris took most of the documents
away. This, I suppose, they found of no value."</p>

<p>"It might be," she meditated.</p>

<p>"What I think I would like you to have," he said, "is the old
miniature at which I see you have been looking. It is of Marie
Antoinette by Fioretto. You will see on the back, on that yellow
sheet of paper, the agreement to pay Fioretto thirty pieces of
gold and to give him the Farm of the Four Hills. That is the farm
on the hillside above. He had a fancy for the place and thought
he might paint there. He was paid and you see he left the
acknowledgment behind. It is a great curiosity."</p>

<p>"Yes," she admitted. "I have looked at it. It is, as you say,
a great curiosity and I should think it would fetch to-
day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't," he pleaded.</p>

<p>"At least half a million francs," she went on. "Thank you, I
am something of a thief, but only one sort of a thief. I will
take this parchment deed in its quaint French for my three
mille."</p>

<p>He scoffed at her.</p>

<p>"But believe me, it is worthless," he pointed out. "Do not
please imagine that it has the slightest value. We have no claim
to a single yard of land in France except the land on which this
Ch&acirc;teau stands. For all that is gone we have been
paid."</p>

<p>"I choose it," she decided.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and, as she rose to her feet, he
locked the box.</p>

<p>"More than ever," she continued, with a smile, "you will
wonder, from that strange little corner of the world in which you
live mentally, at the new race which has come upon the world.
Women who can choose a few pages of yellow parchment, when they
might possess themselves of something really beautiful! Never
mind, we are all as we were made, and beauty means something to
me too."</p>

<p>He pushed the box back and she laid her fingers upon his arm
as they passed down the great vaulted room, where even their
footsteps made ghostly echoes.</p>

<p>"I have chosen my present," she said to him, "and I am taking
it away with me on one condition&mdash;a terribly modern
one."</p>

<p>"It is granted," he promised her.</p>

<p>"If I should find that it has unexpected value&mdash;half of
it is yours and half is mine."</p>

<p>"It <i>has</i> no value," he assured her.</p>

<p>"If it has unexpected value," she repeated firmly, "we divide.
In to-day's language, we go 'fifty-fifty.' You will not be too
proud to divide with me?"</p>

<p>They were out in the fresh air again. He raised her fingers to
his lips.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," he said, "if I were ten years younger and
disaster had not overtaken my house, I would divide my life with
you."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">TO Commodore Jasen, a few afternoons later,
basking comfortably in a <i>chaise longue</i> in a sheltered
corner of the Ch&acirc;teau grounds, which permitted him a
spreading view of the sea, was announced a visitor. He put down
the book and rose to his feet. He recognised, to his great
surprise, Monsieur Debeney, the presiding genius of the Casino,
and the new Juan.</p>

<p>"Good day, my friend," the Commodore exclaimed, as he shook
hands. "What is it that has happened? What service can I have the
pleasure of rendering you? Sit down, pray."</p>

<p>Monsieur Debeney took off his hat, wiped his forehead and
accepted a chair. The Commodore called back the departing butler
and ordered refreshments.</p>

<p>"Commodore," his visitor began, "we have an impression that we
have seen you sometimes with a lady, and it has been made known
to us that she occasionally visits you&mdash;that you are, in
short, a friend of Mademoiselle Loyd who rests at the Cap
d'Antibes H&ocirc;tel."</p>

<p>"The young lady has been a friend of mine since she was a
child," the Commodore assented. "I see little of her here because
the crowd at the Cap d'Antibes is a gay one and I myself prefer a
more peaceful existence, but that she is a friend of mine is the
truth. Proceed, Monsieur Debeney."</p>

<p>Monsieur Debeney was hot, but still pale. He had the air of a
man who took insufficient exercise. He had also the air of a man
who was suffering from a bad fright.</p>

<p>"Some week or two ago," he commenced, "or it may have been
before that, in the Baccarat Rooms of the Casino, this young lady
made the acquaintance of the Marquis de St. V&eacute;ran.</p>

<p>"A resident here?"</p>

<p>"The Marquis," Monsieur Debeney explained, "is the
representative of the family to whom belonged for many
generations the whole of the land around here&mdash;the land upon
which the Casino is built, the hotel and most of the villas, the
land through which most of the roads have been cut. In fact, the
whole place."</p>

<p>"He ought to be a multimillionaire," the Commodore
observed.</p>

<p>"He is, on the other hand, living in dire poverty. He has been
used to coming down to the Casino and playing for low stakes at
<i>chemin de fer</i>. Lately he has borrowed insignificant sums,
most of which have been repaid. It happened, however, that one
night about a week ago he was owing three or four mille. He
applied to our cashier for three mille to discharge a debt, and
my cashier, using in my absence his own judgment, refused to
advance the amount."</p>

<p>The Commodore nodded.</p>

<p>"It sounds hard," he observed, "but I suppose cashiers are not
men of sentiment."</p>

<p>Monsieur Debeney groaned and wiped his forehead with his
profusely scented handkerchief.</p>

<p>"If I had been there," he muttered, "if only I had been there!
However, the thing happened. The young lady whom I have mentioned
was the person to whom the money was due and with great tact and
kindness&mdash;one admits that&mdash;she covered up the incident.
The Marquis invited her, it seems, to his Ch&acirc;teau on the
following day to receive payment. She went there to lunch and
spent a portion of the afternoon there."</p>

<p>"Is all this vital to the matter concerning which you have
come to see me?" Jasen enquired.</p>

<p>"The matter is of too vast an importance not to be told in
detail," the other groaned. "I have had no conversation with the
young lady who, perhaps properly, declines to see me, but through
her lawyer I gather that the Marquis found himself still unable
to produce the three mille. He is of a peculiar temperament, like
many of our aristocracy, and I think his father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must forgive my interruption for one moment," the
Commodore begged. "You told me a few moments ago that it was the
St. V&eacute;rans who owned the whole of the land which has
become the scene of this amazing prosperity. How is it possible
then that the Marquis was unable to discharge so paltry a
debt?"</p>

<p>"That should be explained," Monsieur Debeney acknowledged. "It
was the father of the present Marquis who sold the property. He
sold it to a syndicate of which I was a member, and he sold it,
without a doubt, remarkably cheap. Nevertheless, it was a large
sum. Unfortunately, the late Marquis was a gambler. With the
money we paid him he frequented the casinos of northern France.
He lost everything. No share of that purchase money ever came to
the present Marquis, who inherited nothing but debts."</p>

<p>"I understand," his companion acknowledged. "Now please go
on."</p>

<p>"We arrive at this point, therefore," Monsieur Debeney
continued. "The Marquis found himself unable to discharge even so
paltry a debt as three mille, but unlike his father, the present
Marquis is a man of sentiment and character. There are treasures
still at the Ch&acirc;teau which he has steadfastly refused to
sell. One hears of old Italian masters there locked up, but of
priceless value, and other treasures. What matter? To proceed. He
opens a chest full of <i>objets d'art</i>, and he invites
Mademoiselle to choose something for herself. There was nothing
there which was not infinitely more valuable than the three
mille, but the young lady had, it seems, strange tastes. She
discovered, hidden underneath a roll of engravings, an ancient
document in curious old French, some of which she interprets. In
the end she claims the document for her three mille. Whether she
made any arrangements with the Marquis, we do not know, but he
handed over the document, and she brought it away with her."</p>

<p>"We approach actualities," the Commodore observed. "What was
the nature of the document?"</p>

<p>"It was part of the original title deeds of the Ch&acirc;teau.
There is an old legal term which I have forgotten, governing the
conditions of sale of any landed property in France, and in this
portion of the title deeds there is a special interdiction
against any building or buildings being erected between the
Ch&acirc;teau de St. V&eacute;ran and the sea, visible from the
Ch&acirc;teau, without the consent of two generations of the
family."</p>

<p>Monsieur Debeney leaned back in his chair, once more used his
handkerchief and drank deep of the iced contents of the tumbler
with which he had just been served. Commodore Jasen whistled
softly to himself.</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu!" he exclaimed. "And the document? Is it legal?"</p>

<p>"If its duplicate was deposited at Grasse, there is fear that
it is legal," Monsieur Debeney acknowledged. "We have heard
privately that the duplicate is there."</p>

<p>"And the result?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Debeney groaned.</p>

<p>"The result," he declared, "would be to give the owner of St.
V&eacute;ran&mdash;the present Marquis&mdash;a claim to have
demolished or to possess the Casino and our great hotel
adjoining, not to mention some two hundred villas and small
hotels!"</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen was dumb. What a woman and what luck! The
expression of placid benevolence had left his face. His eyes
burnt with envious fire. There was an ugly twist to his mouth.
Not a word had Caroline said to him of this great find of hers.
He thought nothing of the agony of the little man who had come to
visit him. He was already making plans on his own account.</p>

<p>"We have two lawyers from Paris staying in Nice at the present
moment," Monsieur Debeney continued, "but they are able to give
us very little encouragement. Mademoiselle, your friend, appears
to have contented herself with the services of Monsieur
Lafardi&egrave;re, who is the principal lawyer in these
parts."</p>

<p>"And what is it you want me to do?" the Commodore asked.</p>

<p>"We desire you to use your influence with Mademoiselle, in
whose hands the Marquis seems to have left the whole affair,"
Monsieur Debeney declared eagerly. "There are wealthy men in our
syndicate, and sooner than see the town ruined, we will go from
court to court of France, and the suit may last for years.
Implore her to be reasonable. If the document is veritable, and
our lawyers admit it, compensation shall be paid to the St.
V&eacute;rans or their representatives, but if the fabulous is
demanded, the place would be ruined. We could not pay. We are
determined upon that."</p>

<p>"Do you remember the purchase price of the property?" the
Commodore enquired.</p>

<p>Monsieur Debeney was not altogether at his ease.</p>

<p>"It was not high," he admitted. "But who could have foreseen
what has arrived&mdash;what our enterprise has produced here? At
the time of the purchase, the land was worth no more than its
agricultural value. The syndicate gave, I think, a matter of two
millions for it."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence. Monsieur Debeney's attention seemed
fixed upon his tumbler. His host was looking at him in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Two millions," he gasped. "And to-day its value," he
reflected, "roughly speaking, I should think, would be at least
five hundred millions."</p>

<p>"To-day's value," Monsieur Debeney declared, "is entirely due
to the foresight, the sagacity and the enterprise of our
syndicate. Look at the money we have risked&mdash;the money we
have spent. The Casino might have been a failure, <i>Le monde
chic</i> might not have responded to this new craze for summer
bathing and warmer atmospheres."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you," the Commodore murmured.</p>

<p>"The object of my visit I have now explained," Monsieur
Debeney concluded. "A woman by herself is apt to be unreasonable.
St. V&eacute;ran is angry with us and the anger of such a man is
a difficult matter to deal with. Therefore I say&mdash;will you
talk sense to Mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"I certainly will," the Commodore promised his visitor
emphatically.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">COMMODORE JASEN found Caroline just returned
from Nice. She established him on the terrace whilst she changed
into a bathing suit and peignoir.</p>

<p>"Now," she declared, as she rejoined him, "I feel like a human
being again. Please tell me what you want."</p>

<p>"I have come over to ask you, Caroline Loyd," the Commodore
confided, "whether we are together in this latest enterprise of
yours?"</p>

<p>"We certainly are not," she replied promptly. "Our enterprises
are conducted along different lines, and any idea we might have
had of joining forces ceased the day you took Ned out for an
aquaplane ride."</p>

<p>"I have told you before," Jasen continued quietly, "that this
little corner of the country is not large enough for two bands of
adventurers. We could work together admirably, but to ask one of
us to stand aside and see the other, through sheer luck, bring
off a great coup, is scarcely reasonable. Under the
circumstances," the Commodore went on, feeling that he had made
an impression, and balancing his finger tips carefully together,
"I think that a special arrangement should be made in this case.
You had the luck to stumble into the affair and you had also the
brains to work it. My establishment is much the more expensive,"
he continued, with a sigh, "but that, I suppose, is my own fault.
I suggest that we work on the principle&mdash;in this case only,
mind you&mdash;of two thirds to you and one third to us. I shall
make the same proposition to you with regard to an enterprise
which we are figuring out ourselves, but in it you will take the
lesser part."</p>

<p>Caroline was silent for several moments. Her eyes had
travelled seawards. She was looking at the exact spot at which
the Commodore's flying launch had emerged from the mists on the
morning after Ned's disappearance.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" she asked softly.</p>

<p>"It is all," was the firm reply. "Except this. You should not
need reminding that I and those who are with me are better
friends than enemies."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to have anything to do with you in either
capacity," Caroline pronounced slowly. "I shall be on my guard
against you all the time and I have arranged to leave behind, if
at any time I should make an unfortunate disappearance, several
clues which will be sufficient to break up your little
organisation. I do not need your help. I refuse to have anything
to do with any scheme in which you are concerned. If there is no
room for two bands of adventurers on this strip of the coast,
pack up and go. It was I who had the idea of coming here
first."</p>

<p>"I have unfortunately," the Commodore sighed, "the
Ch&acirc;teau on my hands for the season. I have invested a great
deal of capital in the hire of it&mdash;also in my motor boat. Be
reasonable, Caroline. You know how I feel about you. You keep me
at arm's length, but it is not really wise of you. I am sorry
about Ned, but you know the game and you know the rules."</p>

<p>"I do," she admitted bitterly. "I kept my mouth shut about
Ned, didn't I, although I was fonder of him than anything else in
life? I let you get away with it, but as to working with you or
taking you for a partner&mdash;that will never happen. Besides,
in this case, we are through, as a matter of fact. Fixed. The
thing's done with. You do not take a partner into a deal when the
profit is already made."</p>

<p>"The profit," her companion reminded her, "is not yet in your
pocket."</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"You have my answer," she said. "Now go along down to the
landing stage, step on to your magnificent launch and drive home.
I am going to bathe, but you need not ask me to ride your
aquaplane board!"</p>

<p>They walked down the flinty path almost in silence. Caroline
left her peignoir on the rocks, poised her exquisite figure for a
moment upon the diving board and plunged into the sea. Commodore
Jasen stepped into his motor boat and, swinging her round,
followed the line of the coast down to Juan-les-Pins.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">LATE that night Jasen received a sealed letter
by the hand of a special messenger, brought over from the
principal hotel in Nice. There was no signature to it and no
commencement.</p><br>

<p class="letter">"Record at Grasse discovered confirms and
legalises document but is valueless without production of
document itself."</p><br>

<p>After that, for two days, there was secret activity at the
Ch&acirc;teau d'Antibes, secret activity also at a little hotel
the wrong side of the Seine in Paris, secret activity in a small
flat at Beausoleil. Then, twenty-four hours later&mdash;sensation
in Nice. In the early morning, at the premises of Ma&icirc;tre
Lafardi&egrave;re, the <i>avocat</i>, one of the most perfectly
perpetrated burglaries of modern times was discovered. Both of
the very modern safes had been opened as though by the hand of a
magician, and their contents strewn upon the floor. Every drawer,
tin box and receptacle of any sort had been forced open and
thoroughly explored. It was another twenty-four hours before the
lawyer and his staff of clerks could make the desired report to
the police and to the detectives who haunted the place. In the
end the news came from Ma&icirc;tre Lafardi&egrave;re, who
communicated it in person, with a slight twinkle in his eyes, to
the Chef de la S&ucirc;ret&eacute;.</p>

<p>"Our investigations are complete, Monsieur le Chef," he
announced. "Nothing is missing from our office but a small
quantity of postage stamps, some American razor blades and a
photograph of Greta Garbo which hung in the outer office."</p>

<p>"Then, for what purpose," the official demanded, "was this
burglary planned? It is a work of art. Nothing like it have I
ever seen. The most complicated locks have been opened as though
with butter-smeared keys, the hardest metal has been cut through
as though it were brown paper! Great artists have been here,
Ma&icirc;tre Lafardi&egrave;re. For what reason?"</p>

<p>Ma&icirc;tre Lafardi&egrave;re shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I had only one document of importance," he confided, "and
that was elsewhere."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE Marquis de St. V&eacute;ran, as was
customary with him when the weather permitted, took his luncheon
on the terrace of the Ch&acirc;teau. It appeared that on that
particular morning coffee was not available, so with a little
sigh, he lit a Caporal cigarette and moved his chair farther into
the sunshine. To him came bustling out the shadowy old woman who,
with the exception of her husband&mdash;now at work on the land
but called into the house on rare occasions&mdash;was the sole
domestic employed in the Ch&acirc;teau.</p>

<p>"There are two gentlemen who arrive. One is Monsieur Roubaud,
the other a stranger."</p>

<p>"Place chairs," the Marquis directed wearily. "I will see
them."</p>

<p>Monsieur Roubaud, grey-haired and almost patriarchal in
appearance, whose family had been advisers to the St.
V&eacute;ran family for many generations, presented himself in a
state of much repressed excitement. He introduced his
companion&mdash;a younger, fine-looking man&mdash;Monsieur
Lafardi&egrave;re, who wore a ribbon in his buttonhole and who,
besides being the principal lawyer, was also Mayor of Nice. The
Marquis waved them to the dilapidated seats. He was a little
bored by their visit, for curiosity with him was a dead quality.
He realised only that people had been worrying him about that
mouldy yellow document, which he had given to the beautiful lady
who had saved him from humiliation at the Casino, and that he had
simply passed all enquiries and letters concerning the latter
unopened on to Monsieur Roubaud, who had arrived in haste from
Paris on receipt of the first communication.</p>

<p>"I trust," the Marquis said, "that you gentlemen have lunched.
My housekeeping here is a very simple affair."</p>

<p>"We have lunched," Monsieur Roubaud assured him. "Do not
disturb yourself, I beg, dear Marquis. A great thing has
happened. An amazing thing! I ask myself whether my firm is in
any way to blame, but of that there is no proof. I beg that you
will kindly listen to what Ma&icirc;tre Lafardi&egrave;re has to
say."</p>

<p>"With great pleasure," the Marquis sighed, trying to hide his
weariness.</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Marquis," Lafardi&egrave;re commenced, "I have
been told that you are not a man of business. Very well. I shall
put what I have to say to you in a few commonplace words. Your
father disposed of much of the land which you see stretching from
here to the sea, to a syndicate of men living in these parts. He
was poorly paid, but, as you see, the people who bought the land
have built a casino, hotels, villas, they have made a
<i>plage</i>, they have made huge profits."</p>

<p>The Marquis' eloquent shoulders were for a moment raised.</p>

<p>"It pleased my father to do this," he said coldly.</p>

<p>"Now we come to the point," Lafardi&egrave;re continued. "Your
father had no right to make the sale at all. The solicitors for
the syndicate made the grievous error of not looking into the
conditions under which the property descended from generation to
generation of your family. The condition of the sale of any land
has existed since the year 1700. It was properly recorded at
Grasse and has become a condition of the tenure of the land.
Briefly speaking, that condition is this&mdash;no building could
be erected between here and the sea without the consent of the
reigning Lord of St. V&eacute;ran. Behold, Monsieur le
Marquis&mdash;"</p>

<p>The lawyer's hand was outstretched. Away seawards the land
seemed full of life. The huge white hotel upon the hill yawned
towards them, the Casino sent out its flaunting wings on either
side. The once quiet little village had become a bustling town.
Other hotels, many villas dotted the hillside.</p>

<p>"What is the result of all this?" the Marquis asked, with some
faint show of interest.</p>

<p>"Chaos," the lawyer replied. "The land was improperly sold and
improperly bought. It was sold for something like two millions.
It is worth to-day, with what stands upon it, far more than two
hundred millions. It seems probable, Monsieur le Marquis, that if
you care for a lengthy law process, that sum of money, more or
less, would certainly become yours."</p>

<p>The Marquis moved uneasily in his chair. So many dreams had
come to him during these last years of solitude. This must be
another of them. These men were mocking him. Nevertheless,
although he said nothing, some cloud seemed to have been lifted
from his brain. He listened now with a different light in his
eyes&mdash;a fresh measure of intelligence.</p>

<p>"This extraordinary situation," the lawyer continued, "appears
to have been disclosed by a document which you gave to a lady who
was visiting you. She was a very clever young lady indeed, for
she realised its possible significance and brought it to me.
Whereupon I at once communicated with Monsieur Roubaud. It seems
that you gave her a Power of Attorney to act in the matter for
you?"</p>

<p>"A paper was sent to me from her," the Marquis agreed. "I
signed it. It was her affair. I gave her the document."</p>

<p>"The lady, if I may be allowed to say so," Ma&icirc;tre
Lafardi&egrave;re went on, "has shown a wise discretion. I may
say that the members of the syndicate have been in a state of
terror for the last few weeks, and the matter has been
complicated, gravely complicated, by an organised burglary of my
premises with the obvious intention of stealing the document. The
attempt, naturally, was unsuccessful. I do not keep documents
belonging to my clients, of that value, anywhere except in the
vault of my bank. But forgive me, this is a dissertation. This
morning the lady, whose name it appears is Mademoiselle Caroline
Loyd, has, with our approval, come to an arrangement with the
syndicate, which has already been concluded and registered. She
has accepted as compensation from the syndicate the sum of fifty
millions&mdash;half of which is to be paid to her and half to
you."</p>

<p>The sun was warm, but for a moment the Marquis shivered.</p>

<p>"Half to me?" he repeated in dazed fashion.</p>

<p>"Certainly," the lawyer said. "She told us that that was the
agreement."</p>

<p>"I scarcely thought that I was concerned," the Marquis
faltered. "I gave her the document. I owed her money which I
could not pay. So that was what she meant when she said 'feefty-
feefty'!"</p>

<p>"Fifty-fifty," Ma&icirc;tre Lafardi&egrave;re explained, "is
an Anglo-Saxon term for proclaiming an equal division in a
deal."</p>

<p>"How much, then," the Marquis asked, "is my share?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five millions," Ma&icirc;tre Lafardi&egrave;re
confided. "Twelve million five hundred thousand francs have been
paid into your account at the Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais this
morning."</p>

<p>The Marquis held his head. Three times he repeated the sum.
Then a vagrant thought brought a queer little smile to his
face.</p>

<p>"Sorry," he apologised. "I was thinking of the face of the
bank manager. I was compelled to ask him the other day for two
hundred and fifty francs. He gave it to me, but in doing so he
had the air of a man who was tearing the notes into small pieces
and blowing them away. Twelve million five hundred thousand
francs!"</p>

<p>"The remainder," Lafardi&egrave;re concluded, "will be
deposited to your credit within seven days. The lady is being
treated precisely in the same way. There will be quittances and
papers for you to sign. Monsieur Roubaud will present them to
you."</p>

<p>"And you will forgive a slight liberty, my dear Marquis, I am
sure," Monsieur Roubaud intervened, drawing from his pocket a
long black case and opening it with trembling fingers. "I, as
your old agent and representative&mdash;well, we know how things
are. I thought perhaps&mdash;see, here is a cheque book. Keep
that, please, locked up. I thought perhaps thirty or forty mille
in notes might make the thing seem more real. Fifty mille I
brought. Forty-five in mille notes&mdash;here they are. The rest
in smaller amounts."</p>

<p>The lawyer's fingers trembled more than ever, as he snapped a
rubber band around the packet and pushed it across to the
Marquis.</p>

<p>"Unless there are questions you would like to ask us," he
concluded tremulously, "Ma&icirc;tre Lafardi&egrave;re and I will
take our leave. This is an astonishing happening, Marquis, and I
need not tell you how great is the happiness of myself, my family
and the firm, to see our most valued client restored to such a
great measure of prosperity. It occurs to me&mdash;this must have
been a great shock, Marquis&mdash;you would like to be alone for
a time. I shall wait upon you with my younger partner later in
the day. A domestic staff must be engaged, a car&mdash;oh, there
are many things! Life must be re&euml;stablished for you. We will
talk of practical matters later on."</p>

<p>The Marquis rose to his feet in dignified fashion and he
forgot to lean upon his stick as he bade his guests farewell.</p>

<p>"I have no words," he acknowledged. "They will not pass my
throat. Ma&icirc;tre Lafardi&egrave;re, I thank you for your
visit and for your share in this happening. Roubaud, old friend,
we meet later in the day. I shall be myself then. I offer no more
apologies for leaving you to make your own departure."</p>

<p>They faded away&mdash;Monsieur Roubaud fat and so agitated
that he groped his way across the terrace. Even
Lafardi&egrave;re, the grave man of affairs, was assailed by a
sudden wave of rare emotion. Arm in arm they disappeared....</p>

<p>The Marquis sat alone. A soft west wind was blowing in the
vines which reached almost to the terrace and rustling in the
leaves of the little bower of orange trees and cypresses below.
In his pocket was that unaccustomed roll. He took it out and
examined it. Mille franc notes! He tore one a little at the
corner. There was no doubt about it. He thrust them back into the
depths and rose to his feet. He was alone in the Ch&acirc;teau,
for the old woman who filled the place of <i>bonne &agrave; tout
faire</i> did her modest cooking in the ruins of one of the
outhouses. Alone he began his melancholy promenade. He walked
through the ruined and tarnished suites of reception rooms. The
gilt had dropped from the panels. On the walls themselves there
were great stains of damp&mdash;here and there cracks. There was
thick dust on the floor, a hole in the corner of the first room
where, for many nights, the Marquis had watched, by the light of
his solitary candle, the coming of the first of a small company
of rats. He passed on to the stately gallery, whose only
remaining beauty was its form. There was a fallen oaken beam
which had crashed on to the floor. There were empty frames, with
the mockery of dead beauties smiling their way back into the
memory of the man who paused every now and then to look upwards
in his melancholy pilgrimage. <i>There</i> had been a Murillo,
here at the end, that marvellous painting of King Francis, the
work of Andrea del Sarto, presented to the Lord of St.
V&eacute;ran after he had won the great battle against the
invaders on the heights of Cimiez....</p>

<p>The Marquis pushed open a door half a foot thick, of which
only one hinge still did its work, but which hung bravely on. He
crossed the great hall, cold even on this brilliant day, cold and
damp, with empty leaden frames in the windows from which the
stained glass had gone, many decades ago, to the markets of the
world. He passed into the banqueting chamber where a long deal
plank on trestles, at which a hundred men might have sat,
stretched only half the length of the room. He remembered now the
reason for its presence. Monsieur le Cur&eacute; had begged it
for a school treat on a wet day. He looked through the space
where a window had been, into the little chapel where nothing
remained but the picture of the Virgin, curled up and blistered
with damp, looking down upon the altar. He spared himself
nothing. He passed through the more habitable rooms where the
last generation and he himself had lived, where odd pieces of
furniture still remained, rooms dead with the horror of fireless
years and open windows, through which draughts and winds had,
year by year, brought their poisonous burden of rotting leaves
and dead insects....</p>

<p>The footsteps of the wanderer grew slower. He was fighting his
last battle with the horror with which he had been surrounded for
years, and it seemed as though success had brought defeat, for
there was a hand of ice upon his heart. He stumbled back into the
sunshine, groped his way to the edge of the terrace, leaning on
his stick again now, and gazed down the valley, gazed at the
vineyards where the park land should have been, at the razed
woods which speculators had bought, listened to the distant hum
of the sawmill where birds should have sung, gazed gravely at the
hillside blistered and disfigured by the staring white villas of
the prosperous shopkeepers, over the roofs of the smaller hotels,
to the great structure upon the hills, and down to the Casino.
Nothing, nothing, could change what lay before him. Nothing could
bring life to what lay behind. Millions of bourgeois gold poured
into his hands! What for? Centuries had gone to the beautifying
of the St. V&eacute;ran lands, which seemed suddenly to flow into
life before his eyes, lit with the pain of memory, from the
terrace to the sea. The groves of olive trees, the pine woods,
the two old Proven&ccedil;al farmhouses with their meadow lands
in which cows stood deep in buttercup-starred grass. A golden
strip of cornland reached almost to the edge of the sea. Memory
took him back for a moment, from the horrified contemplation of
the shattered magnificence of his home, where dilapidation
reigned instead of elegance, and dignity had given place to
sordid and humiliating ruin.... He seemed to sense with a sort of
repulsion the suave and black-coated restorer from the
establishment in the Rue de la Paix, brimful of new ideas,
babbling the modern shibboleth of interior decoration, and
heedless of the fact that no power on God's earth could bring
back the beauty which the hand of the speculator had throttled.
They were there for all time&mdash;the bustling hotels, the noisy
Casino, the ugly little villas.</p>

<p>A fit of temporary madness seized him. He drew the fat roll of
notes from his pocket and flung them down amongst the weeds and
cracked stones of the terrace. He tore his cheque book in half,
so that little fragments of white and green paper were fluttering
in the afternoon mistral all over the place. He was glad that
there was no one there to pick up the notes, and he realised with
a fierce despair that the millions, an inevitable force, would
mock him now and for ever in the archives of the bank. He would
never be able to escape from the gifts of the gods that came too
late.</p>

<p>Then, the world seemed suddenly different. A new peace was in
his body, a new sense of life creeping into his veins. An arm was
thrust through his, a faint breath of familiar perfume mingling
with the scent of the roses, a white, reproachful finger pointing
at the torn fragments upon the terrace.</p>

<p>"I was afraid you might be feeling like this," Caroline
whispered. "That's why I came."</p>

<h2><a id="story4" name="story4">IV.&mdash;NO RED RIBBON FOR THE
COMMODORE</a></h2>

<h3>Published in <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i>, Apr 1932</h3>

<p class="first">IT appeared to Commodore Jasen that the world
had turned upside down, when he woke in the small hours of the
morning to find himself looking into the barrel of a somewhat
old-fashioned, but perfectly serviceable revolver. Instinctively
his right hand stole towards the stand at the side of the bed,
where, amongst other articles of possible utility, he kept a
small automatic. His action, however, had been anticipated. The
weapon had disappeared.</p>

<p>"You lay quite still, Guv'nor," a hard voice enjoined. "We're
not looking for trouble, so long as you do what you are told and
keep quiet."</p>

<p>"But what is this all about?" Commodore Jasen demanded. "What
is it you want?"</p>

<p>"I want, or rather we want&mdash;there are plenty of us in the
house&mdash;the key of the old wine cellar."</p>

<p>"Well, you want what I haven't got," was the perfectly
collected reply. "The owners of this property left me a certain
amount of cellarage, but the old wine cellar has been locked up
ever since I took possession."</p>

<p>"Where's the key?"</p>

<p>"At this sacred hour of the morning," Jasen replied, "and with
that most unpleasant-looking weapon pointing at my head&mdash;I
wish you'd lower it&mdash;I can speak nothing but the truth. <i>I
do not know.</i> Do you get that? I do not know where the key of
the old wine cellar is."</p>

<p>"Let's have a look at you and see if you are telling the
truth," the intruder remarked coolly.</p>

<p>He turned on an electric switch, and, in doing so, lowered the
weapon which had given the Commodore so much uneasiness. The two
men were now facing each other, the burglar leaning over the rail
of the bed, and the Commodore sitting up in his bright blue
pyjamas opposite to him. The latter looked long and earnestly at
his vis-&agrave;-vis. Probably English, he decided. Not very
expert at his job. Certainly not a high-class gangster by
profession. The humour of the situation began to appeal to
him.</p>

<p>"So far as regards my portion of the cellarage," he said, "you
will find it at the bottom of the steps leading out of the
kitchen. We have not troubled to fit a lock, as I have confidence
in my servants. If it's a drink you're after, pray help yourself.
If champagne should be your favorite beverage, let me recommend a
small quantity of Veuve Cliquot '19. If it's brandy, you ought to
try my Armagnac&mdash;forty-eight years old, I can assure you,
and genuine."</p>

<p>"Chatty old person, aren't you?" the burglar observed.</p>

<p>"I am talkative upon occasions," Jasen admitted, "but I am not
old. I am not sure that I should be called even elderly. If you
care for a little competition, the sun will be up in half an
hour; I will swim you, box you, run with you, jump with you, for
any sum you like to name."</p>

<p>The man at the end of the bed grinned.</p>

<p>"Well, you're a cool customer," he remarked. "Look here.
Business. We have not come here for nothing, me and my pal. We
have an appointment inside that wine cellar. What we didn't
reckon for was it's having a sheet-iron door. We could blow it to
pieces, but they would hear the noise up at Juan, therefore we'd
rather have the key. If you haven't the key, you must know where
it is."</p>

<p>"My friend," Commodore Jasen began, "let me assure
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was at this point that the Commodore dropped out of the
conversation. The snapped-out command to throw up his hands,
which came from the shadows of the room, was very much more like
the real thing than the burglar's rough invitation. Jake Arnott
had entered the room stealthily and crept round the screen which
the Commodore had established at the far side of his bed.
Compared with the vision of his crouching figure, his set face
and his wicked-looking automatic, held in fingers which gripped
it as though in a vice, the burglar appeared almost like an
amateur. He had sense enough, however, to grasp the situation,
dropped his revolver upon the floor and raised his hands.</p>

<p>"What's he after?" Jake Arnott asked, crawling a little
nearer.</p>

<p>"He says that he wants the key of the old wine cellar," the
Commodore explained.</p>

<p>"So did another one of them, who is looking sick on the grass
outside," Jake Arnott confided. "Upon my word, if this isn't a
queer start. I never reckoned upon burglars in this part of the
world. We didn't even take out an insurance, did we,
Commodore?"</p>

<p>"I don't think we did," the latter replied. "On the other
hand, I don't think we are going to lose anything."</p>

<p>"Not to this outfit, anyway," Jake Arnott scoffed. "I didn't
waste any gunpowder upon the young man downstairs, but I think
he'll have a headache for a week."</p>

<p>"Now that we can speak without embarrassment," the Commodore
remarked, sitting a little farther up in the bed, "let us try and
induce our visitor to explain to us why he is so anxious to
acquire the key of the old wine cellar."</p>

<p>"If I tell you, will you let me go?"</p>

<p>The Commodore considered the matter.</p>

<p>"I really do not think," he decided, "that we should be the
gainers by keeping you. You are not handsome enough for a
pet&mdash;besides, I prefer Sealyhams. We are overstaffed with
servants and you would probably be all the time worrying around
that closed door. Yes, my friend. Gratify our curiosity in the
direction I have indicated, and you may assist your sick comrade
on the lawn and take him where you damn' well please."</p>

<p>The man at the foot of the bed looked suspiciously at his two
companions.</p>

<p>"Sure you're not kidding?" he asked. "You honestly don't know
why Lord Wyndham left that old servant of his here?"</p>

<p>"To spy on us, I expect," the Commodore speculated. "To see we
don't do any harm and try to work up the dilapidation
account."</p>

<p>"Don't you worry," the burglar rejoined. "He left him here on
guard to see that no one tried to break into the cellar. You know
very well that there's nothing else in the house worth a tinker's
damn. Why do you suppose this man sleeps most of the daytime and
spends the night promenading the lower regions?"</p>

<p>"The fellow's talking sense," Jake Arnott acknowledged. "I've
always thought it was a crazy idea. There may be something in
it."</p>

<p>The Commodore clasped his blue-clad legs in his locked hands
and looked affably at his visitor.</p>

<p>"What is there to guard in the old wine cellar?" he asked
insinuatingly.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you the honest truth," the man replied. "I don't
know."</p>

<p>"Then why were you and your companion, properly armed and no
doubt with the usual burglar's outfit, paying us the honour of
this visit?" his questioner persisted. "You were not expecting to
find anything worth while amongst the belongings of us poor
tenants."</p>

<p>"Here's the truth," the other declared. "You can believe it or
not. Old man Wyndham's a millionaire several times over. Every
one knows that. Mean as they make 'em&mdash;a man with the mind
of a shopkeeper, but all the same a great collector. If there's a
sale at Christie's of silver, old pictures, lacquer work,
miniatures, jewels&mdash;anything of that sort&mdash;you will see
Lord Wyndham's name as one of the buyers. Why, only three months
ago he gave seventeen thousand pounds for a pair of vases. He
does the same thing in Rome and the same thing in Paris. I have
heard him say at dinner time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A guest of the house," Commodore Jasen murmured.</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up," the other interrupted. "I was temporary butler
here for three months; as long as any one could stick it, I
should think. I heard him say once at dinner that he scarcely
ever bought a stock or a share, but invested the whole of his
surplus income in portable property. You look around this place.
There isn't a picture or a piece of silver, an ornament, nothing
worth a snap of the fingers. Where is it all, then? Behind that
steel door, <i>I</i> expect. Anyhow we came to see."</p>

<p>"If you were once a butler here," Jasen demanded, "how is it
that you didn't know there was a steel door?"</p>

<p>"Because it's two years since I was in the house," the man
replied, "and that door must have been placed there within the
last twelve months. Any one can see the masonry round it is all
new."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen sidled out of bed and wrapped himself in his
dressing gown.</p>

<p>"Jake," he enjoined, "will you take our friend down and see
him and his companion off the premises? By-the-by, how did you
get here?"</p>

<p>"We came in a fishing boat with a small auxiliary engine," the
man confided.</p>

<p>"Excellent. See them back into their fishing boat, Jake. Let
them start up their old engine and get away before it's
light."</p>

<p>Jake Arnott threw open the door.</p>

<p>"This way," he directed shortly. "I'll show you where to find
your pal."</p>

<p>The two men left the room. Commodore Jasen drew his dressing
gown closer around himself, opened his window and sat out in the
perfumed stillness, his eyes fixed upon the long shaft of light
eastwards. Presently he heard the beat of a motor engine almost
directly below, and in a few minutes the boat, with a single
lantern in front, glided out across the placid waters of the bay,
a spectral-like looking craft in the fading shadows. Immediately
afterwards Jake Arnott could be seen, crossing the lawn.
Commodore Jasen called to him softly and in due course he made
his appearance.</p>

<p>"Bring a chair out, Jake," his patron invited. "We can sit
here and watch the sun rise."</p>

<p>Jake Arnott was not in the mood to appreciate the beauties of
nature. His remarks about the sunrise were pungent and
unprintable.</p>

<p>"Honest to God," he begged, "I wish you'd stop kidding. We've
been here months now&mdash;the Lebworthy Gang, mark you, or the
best of it&mdash;and not once have we touched, whereas the dame
over at the hotel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know all about that, Jake," his companion
interrupted soothingly. "What's your trouble at this particular
moment, though? Are you dissatisfied?"</p>

<p>"My bank account is," was the grim reply.</p>

<p>"What sort of a state is Grogan in?" the Commodore asked with
apparent irrelevance.</p>

<p>"He's conscious but sick."</p>

<p>Jasen's manner seemed suddenly to change.</p>

<p>"There's no one sleeping in the house except our people?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"No one," Arnott replied hopefully. "Got an idea, Boss?"</p>

<p>The Commodore was already back in the bedroom. He drew on a
pair of trousers and fastened them with a belt. Then, after
carefully covering his hand with a pyjama jacket which he took
from a drawer, he picked up the revolver.</p>

<p>"I was trying to think of a safer way," he said slowly. "There
isn't one. Is the boat still in sight, Jake?"</p>

<p>Arnott nodded.</p>

<p>"Their engines ain't up to much."</p>

<p>"This is going to be a rush job," the Commodore confided.
"Come with me, Jake. Follow my lead. Where did you say Grogan
was?"</p>

<p>"In his easy-chair against the wall, facing the door of the
old cellar."</p>

<p>The two men descended the stairs, passed through the kitchens
and went down more stairs into the cellar. In the second crypt
they came upon a pitiful figure. Grogan, his collar torn apart
and his bonds loosened by Arnott, was groaning miserably with
half-closed eyes. There were other and sufficient evidences of
his condition. The Commodore leaned over him.</p>

<p>"Grogan," he enjoined, "pull yourself together, man."</p>

<p>The watchman's eyes opened a little wider.</p>

<p>"Have they gone?" he faltered.</p>

<p>"We've driven them off, but I fear they're coming back. Try
and listen to me, Grogan."</p>

<p>The man's lips moved and he raised himself a few inches. It
was evident that he was doing his best.</p>

<p>"They threatened that they're coming back," Jasen went on,
"with the stuff to blow that door out. You did your duty. You
kept the key away from the burglars. We'll see to the rest. Give
me the keys. We'll protect whatever may be there."</p>

<p>The man's head rolled on one side. He spoke with
difficulty.</p>

<p>"Never&mdash;part with the keys&mdash;his lordship's last
words."</p>

<p>"Listen here, Grogan," the Commodore continued soothingly.
"You have obeyed your master and you have done wonderfully, but
unless you use your common sense it will be of no good. Mr.
Arnott and I will deal with these men when they come back, but if
they bring explosives with them, and if we were to shoot down
here, it would blow the place to pieces. Give us the keys and we
will move the valuables upstairs and guard them till the police
come."</p>

<p>"Have you sent for the police?" Grogan faltered.</p>

<p>"Of course we have," was the impatient reply. "They would have
been here by now if only there was an all-night telephone
service."</p>

<p>The man groaned. He leant over on one side for a moment. His
face was a ghastly colour.</p>

<p>"You have done well so far, Grogan," Jasen assured him. "Don't
spoil it all. If you do not trust us with the keys, you may have
to lie here and see those two men walk inside. They will probably
let you be blown to pieces too."</p>

<p>"The keys," the man confided, "are in a small safe underneath
my bed. The key of the safe is under the pillow."</p>

<p>The Commodore turned swiftly to his companion.</p>

<p>"You heard, Jake," he said. "Get the keys. You know the
bedroom&mdash;it leads off the kitchen somewhere. Bring the poor
fellow some brandy, but don't be long about it."</p>

<p>Jake took swift leave. The Commodore looked down at the sick
man and shook his head compassionately.</p>

<p>"Bad luck," he murmured to himself. "Still, safety first."</p>

<p>He unfolded the revolver which he had been carrying wrapped up
in his pyjama jacket, wound the sleeve carefully around the butt,
stepped back a few paces and raised it. The man's eyes suddenly
opened. He half sat up. A strangled scream gurgled in his throat.
He pawed the air with his hands.</p>

<p>"God," he cried. "Don't! Don't!"</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen fired three times into the man's body, which
fell over in a limp heap. Again being careful not to touch any
part of the weapon with his fingers, he threw it a short distance
away, tucked the pyjama jacket into his dressing-gown pocket, and
turned round to meet Arnott, who was hurrying towards him.</p>

<p>"Put him out, have you?" the latter exclaimed.</p>

<p>The Commodore nodded.</p>

<p>"With him alive, we were for it all the time," he
explained.</p>

<p>"Quite like old times," Arnott muttered appreciatively.
"Here's the key of the safe door. I know that, anyway. All these
little ones must be for places inside."</p>

<p>The Commodore paused to listen. There was silence still in the
house. They moved towards the door and Jake fitted the key. They
were hard men, both of them, and emotions seized them seldom and
sluggishly, nevertheless their half-stifled cry, as they looked
inside, rang out and awakened a hundred echoes in the low vaulted
corridor.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE Commissaire of Police of the district began
to feel himself a very important man indeed. This was the second
murder which he had been called upon to investigate within a few
weeks. He presented himself before the man who had assisted him
to solve the first, with the nearest approach to an amiable smile
which had ever parted his lips. The Commodore was taking his
breakfast in his usual corner of the terrace and greeted his
visitor with the customary handshake.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Monsieur le Commissaire," he invited. "A cup of
coffee?"</p>

<p>"I breakfasted two hours ago, sir," the latter regretted.
"What I have come to see is whether you can give me any ideas
about this terrible affair. It was really you who solved the
Legarge mystery."</p>

<p>Jasen shook his head gently and poured himself out another cup
of coffee.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I cannot be inspired all the time, Monsieur le
Commissaire," he replied. "You see I had something to go by on
the other occasion."</p>

<p>"But this affair," the police functionary pointed out, "has
taken place in the very house you are occupying. From here you
might almost have heard the shots that were fired at the dead
man."</p>

<p>"Quite true," the Commodore admitted, "but you see I didn't. I
heard nothing."</p>

<p>The Commissaire sighed.</p>

<p>"That is unfortunate. You have not even a hint to offer
me?"</p>

<p>"I might be able to fix the time of the affair for you, if
that's any good," the Commodore observed, pushing back his chair
and lighting a cigarette. "I am a very good sleeper and I seldom
wake, but early this morning, without hearing any definite sounds
I found myself sitting up in bed, listening. Then I heard again
the sound which must have wakened me. It was a motor boat in my
private waters, or rather the private waters of the
Ch&acirc;teau. I got out of bed and went out on to my balcony.
Within a few yards of the shore there was what seemed to be a
fishing boat with an auxiliary engine."</p>

<p>"What time was this?" the Commissaire asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Soon after four."</p>

<p>The Commissaire reflected.</p>

<p>"At four o'clock," he remarked, "it is still night. There were
many clouds too. How was it you were able to see the boat?"</p>

<p>The Commodore smiled.</p>

<p>"Because of the lantern hanging in front," he explained.
"There was no moon, it is true, but there was quite enough light,
when one's attention had been fixed upon the lantern, to trace
the outlines of the boat."</p>

<p>"Did you do anything about it?"</p>

<p>"What would a sleepy man do because a fishing boat was too
near his beach&mdash;or rather his landlord's beach?" the
Commodore expostulated. "I got back into bed again and went to
sleep."</p>

<p>"It is your impression, then, that the thieves got away in
that boat?"</p>

<p>"I have no definite impression. It seems likely."</p>

<p>"It appears to me to be a strange thing that not one of your
servants, whom I have interrogated, appears to have heard the
discharge of the revolver or any sound whatever."</p>

<p>"It is a large house," the Commodore reminded his questioner,
"and the cellars are a long way from the servants' quarters. Do I
gather, then, that you have already interrogated my staff?"</p>

<p>"I have seen every one of them," the Commissaire assented,
"including the two young ladies and the elderly one in the
annex."</p>

<p>The Commodore shrugged his shoulders with a gesture of
annoyance.</p>

<p>"In England or in America you would have come first to the
master of the house and asked for permission to interrogate the
servants," he observed.</p>

<p>"The law over here does not bother about permission. We act as
we think best," was the curt rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Have you discovered how the thieves entered the house?" the
Commodore enquired.</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>"Simple enough," he replied. "They cut a large pane out of one
of the lower windows. But to get into the house was a child's
affair. There are other things one asks oneself."</p>

<p>"As, for instance?"</p>

<p>"Many of our French criminals," he confided, "are as bad as it
is possible for that type of man to be, but when they rob they do
not often kill. I ask myself why did they kill the watchman?"</p>

<p>"To get the key," the Commodore suggested.</p>

<p>His visitor indulged in a contemptuous little exclamation.</p>

<p>"How could a dead man give them a key?"</p>

<p>"Then perhaps they killed him because he would not give them
the key."</p>

<p>"But what use would that be to them? It would be
senseless."</p>

<p>"To prevent his identifying them afterwards," the Commodore
ventured.</p>

<p>"Aha!" the other approved. "That is the only idea which I
myself have preserved. They might have got out of that, though,
by wearing masks."</p>

<p>"It appears to me," Jasen reflected, "that the fact of their
killing him, doubtless to avoid identification, is a proof that
they were not, after all, strangers from a Marseilles gang or
anything of that sort. It seems to me proof that they were known
to the watchman and that he recognised them."</p>

<p>"It is a point," the Commissaire conceded.</p>

<p>"It would therefore seem to one a reasonable course of
procedure," the Commodore continued, "to make enquiries in the
near-by ports and see which fishing boats were out last
night."</p>

<p>The Commissaire smiled&mdash;not pleasantly, but with an
obvious sense of amusement streaked with malice.</p>

<p>"Marvellous," he murmured. "You have the genius of a
detective, Monsieur."</p>

<p>Jasen moved irritably in his place. His visitor's manner
puzzled him.</p>

<p>"You have perhaps already pursued that obvious course," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"Soon after daylight," the Commissaire assented, "Jacques
Barataud, one of the worst characters amongst the boatmen,
together with a foreigner&mdash;either English or American, were
detained. From here I go to Antibes to interrogate them again. I
have already had a few words with them."</p>

<p>"Capital," the Commodore observed. "I congratulate you, <i>mon
ami</i>. Has any stolen property been discovered?"</p>

<p>The Commissaire shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It is early to discuss that," he pointed out, "until we know
what was in that amazing hiding place. There was nothing,
however, in the boat or on their persons of the least value."</p>

<p>"Well, my congratulations, in any case," the Commodore
repeated. "You evidently won't need my help this time."</p>

<p>The police functionary saluted and took his leave.</p>

<p>"One never knows," were his parting words....</p>

<p>The Commodore moved to the edge of the terrace, lit a
cigarette, and looked thoughtfully out across the sea. His
expression was completely serene. There was a faint drawing
together of the brows, however, which indicated concentration. He
recognised the footsteps of Jake Arnott crossing the terrace and
spoke to him without turning his head.</p>

<p>"Has the Commissaire gone?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"Sure," Arnott answered, seating himself upon the topmost
step.</p>

<p>"Did the servants line up all right?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>"Zo&euml; and Laura?"</p>

<p>"They couldn't help it. They never heard anything."</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"The trouble with me," Jake Arnott replied, "is that I fancy a
little sea air&mdash;just halfway to the islands and round the
bay."</p>

<p>The Commodore rose to his feet and the two men strolled down
the path. They talked of the mistral that might or might not
develop. The Commodore spoke pleasantly to the men at work,
stopped to help an old woman who was weeding, with her bundle.
They all looked after him admiringly. What a master!</p>

<p>Tim, the mechanic, who was lounging on deck, shot out his hand
at their approach, and the engine was started before they reached
the quay. They glided out from the harbour into the more troubled
waters. The two men spread themselves on the cushions aft.</p>

<p>"Kind of feel we can talk here," Jake Arnott remarked. "These
seagulls look knowing, but their story wouldn't cut any ice, even
in a French court. Boss, I'm not quite sure I like that
Commissaire."</p>

<p>"I've had moments of wondering about him myself," was the
thoughtful reply. "Shoot."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's nothing special. Nothing to get the wind up
about, at any rate," Arnott went on, as he filled his pipe. "The
only thing is, I wondered why he went up into your room and stood
out on the balcony."</p>

<p>"Did he do that this morning?"</p>

<p>"He surely did."</p>

<p>"He must have wanted to see how much I could see of a fishing
boat that was close in," the Commodore reflected. "Well, you can
see a great deal more than any one would imagine."</p>

<p>"Seems to show he's turning things over in his mind," Jake
observed. "Has he had their story yet?"</p>

<p>"He's put them through what he calls the first interrogation,"
the Commodore confided. "That's what struck me as queer. He never
told me what I am perfectly certain one of the men must have told
him&mdash;that he had come up into my room for the keys. He never
told me a word of their story and I couldn't ask him. Now he's
gone back to have another shy at them."</p>

<p>"Things ought to be cast iron for us," Jake Arnott mused. "We
are in a different position from most of the guys who might put
up a show like this. They are nearly always given away by a dame
or one of their own people. There's no chance of that with us.
Zo&euml; and Laura are all right, and if they weren't, they don't
know a damn' thing about it. As for the others,
well&mdash;there's only been three squeals in ten years, and they
were from outside members of the gang, not one of whom lived for
twenty-four hours. Besides, we have got the stuff."</p>

<p>"They know that?"</p>

<p>"They do. Sure," Arnott answered. "Broadman's tickled to
death. He was getting like we were&mdash;a trifle fed
up&mdash;and he wants to send some money home."</p>

<p>"He can have it any time," the Commodore observed.</p>

<p>"What about the stuff?" his chief of the staff enquired.</p>

<p>"The stuff is good," the Commodore acknowledged. "It's better
than I ever dreamt of, but it's none the less extraordinarily
difficult. We shall have to take a voyage out East before we
begin to dispose of it."</p>

<p>"You're a wizard at the valuation, Boss," Arnott said. "What
do you make of it?"</p>

<p>"Three hundred thousand pounds," was the soft but confident
reply. "There are pink pearls and sapphires there, which must
have taken many years to collect, even if every gem merchant from
Port Said to Rangoon was working. The green emeralds I can
scarcely speak about, and by the grace of Providence they are
uncut. There are half a dozen I could take to Amsterdam to-
morrow, under ordinary circumstances, and they would be
unrecognisable in a week, and fit to sell to the most captious
courtesan in Paris or South America. The stuff's all right, Jake,
but&mdash;what we had to leave behind! There's a million pounds'
worth of fairly portable things there still, if only we'd known.
It would have been worth while making this our one exploit in
Europe. We could have done it marvellously."</p>

<p>"Too late now," Jake Arnott said regretfully. "We are too well
known as the tenants of the Ch&acirc;teau, and of course, after
this, every one will be wise to the stuff."</p>

<p>"The pity of it!" the Commodore sighed.</p>

<p>"The rest of it is off the map for us," Jake Arnott decided
firmly. "We've got to go dawdling along as usual for a time. Not
a servant can leave the place, neither can you or I. Our motto
must be 'Life as usual.'"</p>

<p>"You are quite right, Jake," his chief agreed. "You have
nothing more definite to say about the Commissaire, then?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing. I just don't like his manner. Guess I'd better
have a turn on the board. It will look better. I'll pass the word
to Tim."</p>

<p>He rose to his feet, stripped off his Lido shirt, displaying
his scanty bathing attire. The boat slackened down and the board
was thrown out. He dived and clambered on to it. In a few minutes
they were off again at top speed, Arnott swaying from side to
side gracefully, his host watching him from the stern of the boat
with friendly interest. They circled round the bay for half an
hour, then the Commodore passed the word forward and held up his
hand to Jake. The boat slackened speed and circled round. Arnott
dived off the plank and swam to the side.</p>

<p>"I think I'll go and hear the gossip in the bar," the
Commodore decided. "You take the boat back and then send her for
me, Jake. There will be another descent upon the Ch&acirc;teau
before long."</p>

<p>"Sure," Jake assented, as he scrambled on board.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE Commodore was surrounded as soon as he drew
near to the rocks upon which the Cap d'Antibes bathers were lying
sunning themselves. He was, in his way, quite a popular man and
had made a great many friends amongst the
<i>habitu&eacute;s</i>.</p>

<p>"I say, Commodore, they're not giving you much of a peaceful
summer vacation," a stalwart young American observed, rising to
his feet. "We're all crazy to know the truth. Was there really a
burglary last night at the Ch&acirc;teau?"</p>

<p>"There was indeed," the Commodore admitted gravely. "A serious
affair too."</p>

<p>"Is it true that some one was killed?" a woman asked
breathlessly.</p>

<p>"The man whom Lord Wyndham left as caretaker was killed,"
Jasen confided. "Brutally murdered, by the look of it. Shot three
or four times through the body."</p>

<p>"Have they got the man who did it?" some one else
demanded.</p>

<p>"They have made two arrests. I should think they've got the
right fellows," the Commodore replied.</p>

<p>"But what on earth was there at the Ch&acirc;teau to steal?"
an elderly man, who had joined them on their way to the bar,
enquired. "I have been there once or twice to lunch with Wyndham,
and a barer-looking place I never saw."</p>

<p>"I have never been inside it," another one of the group
observed, "although I live not a kilometre away. I have always
heard, though, that Lord Wyndham was a great collector and had
some very valuable things."</p>

<p>"You are both right in a way," the Commodore said, as they
drew into a little circle round one of the tables looking out
seawards. "The place looks as empty of valuables as you could
possibly imagine. In fact, it is like an American seaside
boarding house. Down in the cellars, however, there is a chamber
with a steel door, and I believe that, stored away inside, Lord
Wyndham had a great collection of things he had picked up on his
travels&mdash;<i>objets d'art</i> and jewels of every sort. These
fellows had evidently got to know about it."</p>

<p>"Did they get away with much?"</p>

<p>"No one knows," Jasen went on. "So far, the thing is pretty
mysterious. The caretaker was found shot several times through
the body, by the side of the chair where he used to sit in the
passage outside the cellars. The key of the principal door is
missing from his bedroom, where he used to keep it, but the door
itself is still locked, and at present no one knows how to get
into the vault. Presumably the thieves cleared out what they
wanted, locked up afterwards, and disposed of the key
somehow."</p>

<p>The Commodore had set the ball rolling, but he took very
little part in the babel which followed. Presently, with a word
of excuse, he rose and went to meet Caroline, who was just coming
out of the dressing rooms. She greeted him with a queer little
smile.</p>

<p>"So you are in trouble again," she remarked.</p>

<p>"Come and let me tell you about it," he begged.</p>

<p>She hesitated, but walked with him down the room.</p>

<p>"This is rather against our principles," she reminded him
softly.</p>

<p>"If we didn't break through them sometimes," he pointed out,
"we should be just as noticeable."</p>

<p>"Let us go outside and look at the bathers," she suggested.
"Out through the door there. The wind's getting up, and there, at
any rate, we shall be alone. The echoes in this room are
awful."</p>

<p>They made their way on to the terraced front and leaned over
the wall. Within the last few minutes the weather had changed.
There were whitecaps all over the sea and the rafts below were
beginning to dance about like corks. The bathers had all gone
in.</p>

<p>"There are all sorts of stories flying about," Caroline told
him. "I take it that nothing serious has happened, or you would
not be here."</p>

<p>"There has been a raid upon his lordship's treasures," the
Commodore confided.</p>

<p>"The watchman was killed, I understand," she observed.</p>

<p>He nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"The fortune of war. He might have shot first."</p>

<p>"If it were true," she laughed, "there would be an element of
humour in the whole situation. Fancy <i>you</i> being
burgled!"</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"The element of humour remains," he assured her. "We were
burgled&mdash;a clumsy attempt. But I don't mind confessing to
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please do not confess anything to me," she interrupted.</p>

<p>"Nothing to confess in the way you mean," he continued. "We
actually were burgled. Two of them. They broke in, shot the
watchman, and found the key to the vault. As they locked it up
again and apparently took the key away with them, however, no one
knows what is missing."</p>

<p>"Except perhaps you," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Except perhaps me," he assented.</p>

<p>She sighed.</p>

<p>"I am a lady of fortune now," she remarked, "and I am not at
all sure that I like to be on friendly terms with any one in your
profession."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Are you quitting it altogether?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Unless something very special, and very safe, and almost
moral, comes along," she replied. "I saw that Jake Arnott was out
on the board&mdash;a very subtle gesture, I thought, yours this
morning. I knew from the moment I saw you indulging in your
innocent little recreation that you were in this last piece of
trouble. We must not stay here any longer. I have a friend coming
to lunch."</p>

<p>"Yes," the Commodore admitted, brushing back his white hair,
which the wind had disarranged, and replacing his yachting cap.
"We are in it, but we shall get out of it. I am not sure that it
will not be one of the neatest affairs we have ever handled."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"The three shots into the body," she objected, "was rather a
mistake. Only American gangsters do that sort of thing."</p>

<p>The Commodore raised his cap as they parted and his smile of
farewell was both genial and affectionate.</p>

<p>"I like to make sure," he said.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THERE followed days of tragical rumours. A
stream of gendarmes and their superiors seemed to be all the time
in and out of the Ch&acirc;teau. Commodore Jasen kept out of it
as much as he could. He gave a great luncheon party at the Eden
Roc, with Caroline his guest of honour, and his health was drunk
to the strains of music before the gathering broke up. His
popularity amongst the guests of the hotel and in the
neighbourhood increased daily. On all sides his friends and
acquaintances deplored his ill luck. First of all, his summer had
been half spoilt by the loss of his aquaplane passenger, Ned
Loyd, and now, under his own roof, a burglary in his temporary
abode and a man shot to pieces. Hard luck indeed, every one
agreed, that these two tragedies should have happened to a
harmless, genial little person who had paid an immense rent for a
few months' sunshine and bathing and repose. So they stood up and
drank his health, and drank it again, and Commodore Jasen thanked
them with tears in his eyes, and declared that, for the first
time for weeks, he felt a human being again. He made his way
homeward on foot and alone, for Jake Arnott had not attended the
luncheon, but remained&mdash;the eternal sentry&mdash;watching
the servants, watching for the newcomers, guarding against any
new and untoward happening. The Commodore knew the short cuts and
very soon arrived upon his own beach. There, on the edge of the
sea, with his head, as usual, bent downwards, stood the
inevitable figure of the Commissaire. Jasen paused and looked at
him. How he was beginning to hate the man! How joyfully his first
finger could pull the trigger of any gun that might consign him
to perdition. Nevertheless, there were no signs of these
sentiments, as he picked his way over the pebbles to within
hailing distance.</p>

<p>"Hello, <i>mon ami</i>!"</p>

<p>The Commissaire turned round. There was no start or surprise
in his manner. He might even have been conscious of the
Commodore's approach. He made his way quietly towards him.</p>

<p>"Nothing fresh?" the latter enquired.</p>

<p>"Nothing," was the dreary reply. "The business presents great
difficulties."</p>

<p>"Is any part of the mystery to be solved, do you think,"
Commodore Jasen asked lightly, "by standing here and gazing
across at Antibes? You had the air of one very deep in
thought."</p>

<p>The police functionary shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>"It was you yourself," he said, "who initiated me into the
finer arts of reconstruction. I came down from the house
hurriedly. I stood here, from where the two men must have waded
to the boat, for they had no dinghy. I wondered what they would
do if they had something they wanted to dispose of hurriedly. I
have been looking around to see if I could find any traces of
that object."</p>

<p>"What is it precisely that you are looking for?" Jasen
asked.</p>

<p>"The key. You remember, the key has never been found. Mr.
Crowhurst, the agent, has opened the door of the chamber with his
duplicate."</p>

<p>"I had forgotten about the key," Jasen observed. "So that is
the reason we have two gendarmes on guard before the door."</p>

<p>"How did you know that?" the other asked.</p>

<p>"Servants' gossip. When you come to think of it," the
Commodore went on, "it seems strange that the revolver, which is
so much more important a piece of evidence than anything else,
should have been thrown carelessly away down the corridors of the
cellars themselves, where it was certain to be found, and the
key, the further use of which is scarcely apparent, should have
disappeared."</p>

<p>"There are more curious things still," the Commissaire
remarked, pushing back a long wisp of black hair from his eyes,
"concerning this affair. Four times now I have questioned those
two men, and not even I, who have some skill, have had fortune.
Their story is always the same. They failed to find the key after
chloroforming the watchman, one of them came to your room in
search of it, he was surprised there by your friend, Mr. Arnott,
who had already knocked the other one senseless. With that they
were turned out of the house, they embarked in their boat and
sailed for Antibes."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen smiled in mild approval.</p>

<p>"Why should they change such a story? It is the only one
possible," he pointed out. "I imagine that, according to them,
they left the watchman alive and the door of the treasure chamber
unopened."</p>

<p>"That is their story," the Commissaire admitted.</p>

<p>"Another improbable part about it," Jasen continued, "is that
they did not attempt to explain who killed the watchman or
committed the robbery, if&mdash;as gossip tells us&mdash;a
robbery was committed. Perhaps their idea is to suggest that
there was another set of criminals at work at the same time?"</p>

<p>The Commissaire was walking slowly towards the house, his
hands behind his back. His head was uplifted towards the skies,
that faint twist of the mouth&mdash;an unpleasant gesture in
which he frequently indulged&mdash;was displaying his
unattractive teeth.</p>

<p>"They are very frightened," he ruminated. "They do not talk
sensibly."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Crowhurst, the agent," the Commodore asked, "has he
completed his inventory? I do not wish to seem inquisitive, but I
think I am entitled to your confidence as regards the details of
this affair."</p>

<p>The Commissaire nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"The result," he confided, "is bad. It is very bad. There are
jewels missing valued at an enormous amount."</p>

<p>The Commodore's equanimity seemed at last to be disturbed.</p>

<p>"That means," he rejoined irritably, "that there will be no
end to these investigations. They will be going on the whole of
the time. I must have a talk with Mr. Crowhurst. I think I shall
cancel my agreement and move to the hotel."</p>

<p>"To the hotel," the Commissaire mused.</p>

<p>"Yes. Why not? I am sorry for Lord Wyndham's loss, of course,
but he should not keep such treasures in a house he lets out for
six months at a time. The tenants have a right to some
consideration. Crowhurst is still in the house, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"He is still there. I begged him to wait. We have a favour to
ask of you, Monsieur. I thought I should like him to be
present."</p>

<p>"A favour?" the Commodore repeated. "You won't find me in a
very amiable mood for granting favours."</p>

<p>"This one, I think, will appeal to your sense of fairness,"
the other declared.</p>

<p>They made their way into the library, where the agent&mdash;a
very worried-looking man&mdash;was writing out cables to his
employer. He greeted the Commodore with the respect and
<i>empressement</i> due to his position as a valuable client.</p>

<p>"You have heard the news, sir?" he groaned.</p>

<p>The Commodore nodded.</p>

<p>"Damn' bad news for all of us," he said, with some trace of
his former irritation still lingering in his tone. "What do you
suppose the value of the missing jewels is?"</p>

<p>"I have only his lordship's private valuation," the agent
confided. "That amounts to something like half a million pounds
sterling."</p>

<p>"Which means, I suppose," Jasen observed bitterly, "that this
house is to be invaded now by detectives from Paris, detectives
from Lyons, insurance men, private enquiry agents, and God knows
what! I have just told our friend of the police here that I shall
move up to the hotel. You will have to make some arrangements as
regards my tenancy, Mr. Crowhurst."</p>

<p>"Don't, for heaven's sake, suggest any more complications!"
the agent begged, holding his head. "We'll see how things work
out. I'll undertake that you're not worried in any
way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Except for just that one little matter," the Commissaire
intervened.</p>

<p>The agent nodded uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"I am sure, sir," he said, "that you will forgive me, under
the circumstances, if I make a very unusual request. I promised
the Commissaire that I would put the matter to you. He finds your
French is as near as possible perfect, but he thought that
perhaps I would be able to explain the matter better."</p>

<p>"Go on," the Commodore directed.</p>

<p>"It is the matter of the revolver. The man who tells the story
of having visited you in your room swears passionately that you
took it away from him and that he never used it against the
murdered man. The law demands that such evidence as is possible
should be taken&mdash;even though his statement is improbable.
The Commissaire wishes the fingerprints of every person in the
house taken and compared with the fingerprints on the revolver.
He thinks that it would make the matter so much easier if you
would consent to having your own taken first. No one then would
feel that they were under suspicion."</p>

<p>The Commodore stroked his white moustache. His blue eyes were
fixed upon the agent. He glanced towards the Commissaire. All the
time his mind was fixed upon a brief period&mdash;some few
seconds&mdash;during which his fingers, stretched downwards, had
halted and he had wrapped the blue coat of his pyjamas around his
hand. Perhaps he might have been forgiven for thinking that he
walked hand in hand with Fate.</p>

<p>"The request seems a little unusual," he remarked mildly, "but
I see the point. Certainly&mdash;I consent. You had better call
the servants up, so that they can see me submit myself to this
ordeal. You have your man here, I suppose?" he added.</p>

<p>The Commissaire agreed. There was perhaps a shadow of
disappointment in his tone as he rang the bell.</p>

<p>"He is waiting outside with his apparatus," he said. "If you
will be so good as to order your servants in, the matter can
proceed."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE tenant of the Ch&acirc;teau d'Antibes,
seated in his favourite sunny corner on the following morning,
reading his <i>Eclaireur</i> and enjoying one of his excellent
cigars, looked up to greet the Commissaire.</p>

<p>"What, you here again!" he exclaimed, with an air of weary
good humour.</p>

<p>The visitor nodded.</p>

<p>"I am here again," he admitted. "I thought you would wish to
know the result of the fingerprints examination."</p>

<p>"I knew it beforehand," was the indifferent reply. "None of my
people were down in the cellars that night."</p>

<p>"That would appear to be the case," the Commissaire reported.
"The fingerprints are very blurred, but the only ones which it is
possible to trace at all are the fingerprints of the older of the
two men whom we were holding."</p>

<p>"Whom you <i>were</i> holding?" the Commodore repeated. "Do
you mean that you have let them go?"</p>

<p>The Commissaire sighed.</p>

<p>"It is most unfortunate," he said. "The two men were confined
in a reasonably guarded room in the prison, which, as you know,
is overlooking the harbour. We dared not put them in the cells
until the examining magistrate had made his report. Last night
they managed to crawl out of the window and on to a coping, and
from that they both dived into the harbour."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that they escaped?" the Commodore asked.</p>

<p>The police official shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"A poor sort of escape," he confided. "They are both drowned.
The bodies were recovered just before I started for here."</p>

<p>The Commodore laid down his paper.</p>

<p>"God bless my soul," he murmured. "Drowned! What about the
jewels?"</p>

<p>The Commissaire sighed once more.</p>

<p>"They had a matter of six hours before they were arrested in
which to conceal them. We shall commence at once a systematic
search. It is possible that, having gone further than they
intended and actually murdered the watchman, they may have thrown
the jewels&mdash;in a panic&mdash;into the sea. The search has
already commenced, however. We have hope."</p>

<p>The Commodore rose suddenly to his feet, walked to the edge of
the terrace and picked up a pair of field glasses. He looked
through them for several moments. His companion presently joined
him.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon ami</i>, an idea!" the Commodore exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Your ideas are always good," was the eager comment.</p>

<p>"Across from the landing place to the port&mdash;look. There
are one, two, three, four, five lobster pots. If one of those
should have belonged to either of the two men&mdash;what a
wonderful hiding place!"</p>

<p>"And two of them did!" the Commissaire cried in much
excitement.</p>

<p>Jasen smiled triumphantly.</p>

<p>"I shall not expect a reward," he observed, "as I am
unfortunately already classed amongst the millionaires, but if
you discover the jewels, I shall certainly expect to be
decorated!"</p>

<p class="first">VAN DEYL, naked as the day he was born, stood in
the centre of the Eden Roc dressing room&mdash;six foot two of
symmetric young manhood&mdash;and looked around him with a
discontented frown.</p>

<p>"Say, what's happened to this place, anyway?" he demanded.
"The first thing I hear when I arrive is that Ned Loyd&mdash;one
of the best&mdash;good old Ned!&mdash;has been drowned
aquaplaning, then there has been a murder and a great robbery up
at the Ch&acirc;teau, and now I can't find my panties. Something
sinister in all this."</p>

<p>The valet, who had been assisting in the search, appeared with
a very abbreviated pair of knickerbockers, which Van Deyl
accepted and buckled on with a grunt of thanks. A friend turned
round from the wash-basin.</p>

<p>"It does seem as though there was something queer about the
place this season, George," he remarked, rubbing his tousled hair
vigorously with a towel. "There was a murder too up at St. Paul,
at that jolly little restaurant, one night. Beastly affair.
Still, there's plenty of fun going. I'm not sure that the pace
isn't even hotter than last year. My little crowd got in at seven
o'clock this morning."</p>

<p>"Call that a holiday," his friend grunted.</p>

<p>"You'll be doing the same yourself in a day or two," was the
cheery comment. "There's something about sitting up late here
which seems part of the life. Lighter drinks perhaps."</p>

<p>George Van Deyl stretched himself, left the room, crossed the
passage and made his way through the crowded bar towards the
diving boards. Halfway to his destination he came face to face
with Ralph Joslin, peignoir-clad and dry from a sunbath. The
former paused irresolutely.</p>

<p>"Hello, Joslin!" he greeted him.</p>

<p>"Hello, George!" the other replied.</p>

<p>There was a moment's awkwardness, as sometimes happens when
men engaged in the secret business of the world come face to face
in a public place.</p>

<p>"Your first visit, isn't it?" Joslin enquired.</p>

<p>Van Deyl nodded.</p>

<p>"I'm a Biarritz man," he confided. "Uncertain weather, but
glorious sea when you can get into it."</p>

<p>Joslin glanced around. No one appeared to be taking any notice
of them.</p>

<p>"Still at the old shop?" he asked.</p>

<p>Van Deyl was mildly surprised.</p>

<p>"I should say not," he replied. "I quit two years after the
War. Shouldn't have stayed that long except that there were one
or two matters I wanted to clear up. I'm in Wall Street now and
in the soup with all the rest of them."</p>

<p>"Bad luck!" Joslin commiserated, showing signs of moving
on.</p>

<p>"I'd like to have a few minutes with you after I've had a
swim," Van Deyl remarked.</p>

<p>"I shall be about," Joslin answered, without any particular
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Van Deyl strolled thoughtfully out into the sunshine, shielded
his eyes for a moment with his hand, then descended the stone
steps and walked to the end of one of the springboards. He
hesitated for a moment, stretched himself, and then made an
unostentatious dive. His last thought as he fell through space
into the salt water was of the man he had just left.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">CAROLINE LOYD, very elegant in her green
pyjamas, tightly fitting green cap and cape, waved to Joslin as
he climbed the stairs and looked around the Eden Roc restaurant.
He crossed the floor at once to the table where Caroline was
awaiting him.</p>

<p>"Hope I have not kept you waiting," he apologised. "I saw Van
Deyl downstairs."</p>

<p>"George Van Deyl?" Caroline asked.</p>

<p>"The same."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, followed by a discussion about
lunch.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," Joslin went on, as soon as they had given their
order, "that our habit of occasionally interfering in other
people's business has developed in me the vice of curiosity."</p>

<p>"It is a very amiable failing," Caroline sighed. "It gives one
so many interests in life."</p>

<p>There was a brief pause. The <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>
had stopped in passing to offer his respectful greetings. The
wine man had appeared for his customary order. Both men presently
faded away.</p>

<p>"Is it George Van Deyl who has stimulated your curiosity?"
Caroline enquired. "You were in X.D.O. with him, weren't
you?"</p>

<p>"For one year only, during the war," Joslin confided. "I went
back as soon as I was fit again into active service. Van Deyl
couldn't. Some of us thought he was going to be an invalid for
life about that time, but he pulled himself together somehow or
other. Says he is in Wall Street now."</p>

<p>Caroline smiled.</p>

<p>"You appear to be rather incredulous."</p>

<p>"I am," he admitted. "I happen to know that he is second in
command to-day at X.D.O., and the best man they have got for
foreign missions. If you will believe me&mdash;he is staying here
with the most abominable little specimen of a man you ever
saw."</p>

<p>"That sounds queer," Caroline commented. "George Van Deyl
always used to be very particular about his company."</p>

<p>"Well, you wouldn't be seen in the same party with this
fellow," Joslin declared. "He is a slimy-looking, bumptious
little bounder of the worst possible type. But&mdash;he is a
multimillionaire," Joslin added. "I cannot help thinking that
George is not here with him for nothing. They have something on.
I am going to hang around after lunch and see if there is
anything to be picked up. Where can I find you later in the
day?"</p>

<p>"In my sitting room at seven o'clock," Caroline replied. "I
always try to get an hour's rest before I change. Don't get to
work too soon unless it is urgent. I have a date for dinner."</p>

<p>"That's the worst of a woman," Joslin grumbled. "Always
pleasure before business."</p>

<p>Caroline laughed.</p>

<p>"Show me the business," she challenged.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">FOR one of the finest ch&acirc;teaux in the
Alpes-Maritimes, the room in which George Van Deyl and Mr. Reuben
C. Essenheim were invited to attend the pleasure of the man whom
they had come to visit certainly lacked any suggestions of
hospitality. It was approached by a long corridor leading from
the very magnificent hall, and was a plain square apartment with
stone walls and a stone floor, in the exact centre of which
reposed one priceless rug. The walls were undecorated, of
furniture there was none except six high-backed but supremely
uncomfortable Proven&ccedil;al chairs of the best period, which
stood primly on one side of the room, and a further six opposite.
Between them was a round table. The windows were small and high
and protected by bars. The room, but for the choiceness of its
scanty furniture, might well have been the waiting room of a
prison or some public institution.</p>

<p>"Say, that young man would need to get a push on if he were
secretary to an American," Mr. Essenheim remarked, glancing at
his watch. "Another ten minutes in this morgue of a room and the
salt tears will stand in my eyes. Do you reckon he knows that I
am Essenheim, Chairman of the Grand Prudential Trust?"</p>

<p>Van Deyl yawned.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose he's ever heard of the Grand Prudential
Trust," he replied.</p>

<p>His companion gazed at him, open-mouthed.</p>

<p>"Say, young fellow, are you trying to put one over on me?" he
demanded. "This Prince, whom we've come to visit, is a
millionaire, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"He's a very rich man," Van Deyl acknowledged.</p>

<p>"Then you're not going to tell me that he's not heard of the
Grand Prudential Trust," Essenheim scoffed. "Where there's money
the folks know about the Grand Prudential Trust."</p>

<p>"Maybe," was the curt comment. "Here comes the secretary,
anyway."</p>

<p>There were footsteps in the long passage outside, then the
door was quietly opened. The young man who had taken their
message reappeared. He was tall and good-looking in a studious
sort of way. His manners were exceedingly good. It was ominous
that he held in his hand the card which Mr. Essenheim had pressed
upon him. He laid it unostentatiously upon the table.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, gentlemen," he announced. "His Highness
declines to break his rule. He has no longer any interest in
outside affairs. They are all arranged for him."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that he refuses to see me?" Mr. Essenheim
exclaimed angrily. "You showed him my card? He understands who I
am and whom I represent?"</p>

<p>"I daresay he does not understand that," the secretary
admitted, "because he has no interest at all in financial
matters. On the other hand, he wished me to say to you, Mr. Van
Deyl, that he is anxious to show every courtesy to a
representative of your Government, but he scarcely sees in what
way he can be of service to you."</p>

<p>"Naturally he can't understand that before I have had an
opportunity of explaining," the young man declared eagerly. "If
he will see us for five minutes I shall deliver to him personally
a message from an official in Washington with whom he has some
acquaintance, and I feel sure he will then understand our
intrusion."</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Van Deyl," the secretary acquiesced. "If you
will undertake not to be with him more than five minutes, I am to
conduct you to him."</p>

<p>He turned towards the door. Essenheim followed the two
men.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," the secretary observed, turning round. "I
fear I did not make myself quite clear. The Prince will only see
Mr. Van Deyl, out of compliment to his official position. No one
else."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that I am to sit here and wait?" Mr.
Essenheim spluttered.</p>

<p>"You can walk in the garden, if you please," the young man
pointed out. "I can assure you that it will not be a matter of
more than a few minutes."</p>

<p>Mr. Essenheim, who probably had never been so angry in his
life, was speechless. They left him there, however, crossed once
more that magnificent hall, and passed into a very beautiful
apartment upon the ground floor. Van Deyl, although he had scant
opportunity to look around, had the impression of having found
his way into a palace. His companion ushered him towards the
spacious writing table at which a tall, grey-haired man was
seated. In front of the latter were three or four photographs of
pre-Rafaelite pictures, some books of reference and a small
priceless Old Master, which scarcely needed the magic scrawl of
Fra Filippo Lippi in the corner. A little to the left, through
the open window, was a stretch of beautiful country, a gleam of
blue sea, between the trees the Esterels&mdash;dim violet
monsters traced against the distant sky.</p>

<p>"Your Highness," his secretary said quietly, "this is Mr. Van
Deyl&mdash;the young American gentleman who wishes to see
you."</p>

<p>The Prince, who had been writing laboriously on a large sheet
of foolscap, turned round, the black ebony pen with its gold
clasps still in his hand. He had a short, pointed grey beard as
well as a mass of grey hair, and his eyes were the eyes of a
dreamer.</p>

<p>"Mr. Van Deyl," he said, with stiff courtesy, "you announce
yourself as an official representative of a certain branch of the
United States administration; otherwise, as is well known, I do
not receive callers. What does the American Government require
from me?"</p>

<p>Van Deyl was somewhat taken aback. He met the question
frankly, however.</p>

<p>"The American Government is not directly concerned in my
mission," he acknowledged, "but Mr. Essenheim, my companion, has
a scheme for the purchase of an almost defunct railway which
operates close to the frontier of a foreign country. For certain
reasons it has been decided at Washington that it would be a
great advantage to us to have that railway line
re&euml;stablished. Officially we can do nothing, but we are
prepared to support, to a certain extent, any private enterprise.
Part of our support is my presence here and this explanation
which I am asked to give you officially."</p>

<p>"And my interest in the matter?" the Prince enquired.</p>

<p>"You are the registered holder of a large number of the
shares," Van Deyl explained. "Why you bought them, or how they
came into your possession, no one knows, but they are registered
in your name, and dividends&mdash;in the days when there were
any&mdash;have been received by you. Mr. Essenheim cannot
complete any scheme for the reorganisation of the railway without
acquiring control, and whoever desires control must possess your
shares. He is, therefore, over here with a proposition to you to
buy them."</p>

<p>"Then, the sooner Mr. Essenheim&mdash;or whatever his
euphonious name may be&mdash;gets back to where he came from,"
the Prince replied, "the better. In these days my life is
dedicated to one object. I have a man of affairs who sees after
such matters as those to which you have alluded."</p>

<p>"Let us, if you please," Van Deyl begged, "get into touch with
him. We have no wish to trouble you personally. Let us put the
matter before him and he can then ask for your instructions.
Money is doubtless not of much object to you," the young man
added, "but you will certainly be a great deal better off if you
listen to what Mr. Essenheim has to say."</p>

<p>"The only thing in the world of which I have too much," the
Prince replied coldly, "is money. I should refuse to listen to
any scheme increasing my income."</p>

<p>Van Deyl was staggered. It was very hard indeed to adopt
ordinary business methods and modes of persuasion with any one
holding such views.</p>

<p>"Your shares are absolutely valueless," he pointed out
desperately, "under present conditions. They are not quoted on
the Stock Exchange, they are producing no dividends, they will
never be of any value unless the railway is reorganised. Mr.
Essenheim is the man to do that and this is the moment."</p>

<p>"My chief inspiration concerning this particular moment," the
Prince said gently, "is that it is an opportune one for you to
take your leave. Your request is refused. Please do not trouble
me again in the matter."</p>

<p>He swung round in his chair. Already his eyes were searching
for the place in the manuscript where he had broken off.</p>

<p>"Will you at least tell me the name of your man of affairs?"
Van Deyl implored.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," was the cool refusal. "I should regard any
further move on your part in this matter as an impertinence.
Charles," he added, turning to his secretary, "show this
gentleman and his friend out."</p>

<p>Van Deyl made his way back to where Essenheim was waiting and
Mr. Reuben C. Essenheim had a great deal to say. Nevertheless, it
was perfectly ineffectual. The secretary, though his manners
remained pleasant, with a couple of servants in the background,
was an omnipotent force. The two ambassadors were politely, but
ignominiously, shown off the premises. As they stepped into their
car on the other side of the great iron gates, Mr. Essenheim was
still talking furiously. A young man who was making some
adjustments to his motor bicycle, which was leaning against the
wall, watched them with curious eyes as they left.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE next stage in the proceedings connected with
the inauspicious mission of George Van Deyl and Mr. Reuben C.
Essenheim was marked by the following letter from an eminent firm
of American lawyers established in Paris. It was addressed to the
ancient house of Lafardi&egrave;re and Fils of Nice, and ran as
follows:</p><br>

<p class="letter">Dear Sirs,</p>

<p class="letter">We understand that you act as agents in the
affairs of the Duc de Sousponnier, resident at the Ch&acirc;teau
de Sousponnier, and sometimes known as Prince Maurice of St.
Sa&euml;ns. We are the European representatives of the Grand
Prudential Trust, the President of which&mdash;Mr. Reuben C.
Essenheim&mdash;is in this country at the present moment. Acting
upon his instructions, we are venturing to approach you with
regard to our client's desire to acquire a block of shares,
namely, 4390, in the Great Eastern Railway Company of Texas.</p>

<p class="letter">We should like to say, for your information,
that the railway is at present inoperative. The shares of the par
value of $100 are unquoted, and no dividend of any sort has been
paid for the last seven years. These facts can easily be
confirmed. Furthermore, a recent bankers' estimate of the value
of the shares under present conditions was $12&frac12;, and we
venture to think that at that price there would be few likely
purchasers. Our client, however, who has been exceedingly
successful in various reorganisations, has outlined a scheme to
rebuild and re&euml;stablish the railway under entirely fresh
auspices. To do so it is necessary for him to own control of the
shares. He is a very large holder already, and has bought several
considerable blocks at from $12&frac12; to $15 a share. He wishes
to acquire the holding of your client, the Duc de Sousponnier,
and for that purpose he will be glad to know at what price the
Duc would be prepared to sell his holdings for cash. We are not
asking you, of course, to accept our word for the fact which we
have stated, but we should be glad if you would make the
necessary enquiries through your bankers, and communicate with us
as speedily as possible, as our client is anxious to return to
the States.</p>

<p class="letter">Faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="letter">Bland &amp; Henshaw.</p><br>

<p>The reply to this letter was received within a few
days.</p><br>

<p class="letter">Dear Sirs,</p>

<p class="letter">We have received your communication respecting
your client's suggested purchase of the shares in the Great
Eastern Railway Company of Texas, held by our client the Duc de
Sousponnier. We regret, however, to inform you that His Highness
is not disposed to make any offer of the shares in question.</p>

<p class="letter">Faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="letter">Lafardi&egrave;re &amp; Fils.</p><br>

<p>On receipt of this letter Van Deyl had hard work to keep his
friend Mr. Reuben C. Essenheim from precipitating himself into
the sea. For twenty-four hours he shook with fury. At the end of
that time he was himself again, and in due course another letter
from Messrs. Bland and Henshaw reached the firm of
Lafardi&egrave;re and Fils.</p>

<p><i>Dear Sirs</i> [it said],</p><br>

<p class="letter">We are in receipt of your letter of the 17th,
and regret very much that your client will not state the price at
which he is prepared to sell his holding in the Great Eastern
Railway Company of Texas. The acquisition of his shares is
frankly necessary before the reconstruction of the company can be
attempted. We cannot believe that your client would deliberately
block the development of a great industrial enterprise, and we
trust that you will take an opportunity of explaining the matter
fully to him. If the company continues moribund, the shares which
you hold on your client's behalf will decline in value until they
simply become wastepaper. Not only your client, but many other
stockholders throughout the country will suffer. We are
instructed to offer you in cash, payable at the Cr&eacute;dit
Lyonnais within twenty-four hours of your agreement to sell, the
sum of $50 a share for your 4390 shares, amounting to $219,500,
or at to-day's rate of exchange Frs. 5,487,500. We may add that
this offer is one which can never be repeated, and which is at
least five times in excess of the present value of the
shares.</p>

<p class="letter">Faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="letter">Bland &amp; Henshaw.</p><br>

<p>The reply to this was prompt and brief.</p><br>

<p class="letter">Dear Sirs,</p>

<p class="letter">In reply to your offer for our client the Duc
de Sousponnier's holding in the Great Eastern Railway Company of
Texas, our client wishes us to state positively that he does not
intend to sell such holding at any price, and he desires no
further communication upon the subject.</p>

<p class="letter">Faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="letter">Lafardi&egrave;re &amp; Fils.</p><br>

<p>Mr. Reuben C. Essenheim was a man who had never known a day's
illness in his life, but on receipt of the translation of this
letter he took to his bed for two days and refused to speak to
any one. Van Deyl, passing his time rather warily down at the
bathing club and in the Casino, came face to face with Joslin one
morning.</p>

<p>"What's become of your little pet?" the latter asked.</p>

<p>Van Deyl indulged in a grimace.</p>

<p>"Sulking," he announced. "He's been so used to having his own
way ever since he became prosperous, that he can't understand
life over here, or the mental outlook of people who do not think
along the same lines. For the first time in his career, I think,
he is beaten, and it's going hard with him."</p>

<p>"The worst of these little men who don't drink," Joslin
observed, "is that they have no other way of getting rid of their
gall, so they go to bed and very often turn sick."</p>

<p>"I'm the fellow who ought to be sick," Van Deyl remarked
gloomily. "I have given up my holiday to this job, I've had to
cart the little bounder around for two months with just my
expenses paid, and I was to have got fifty thousand dollars if
the thing had come off."</p>

<p>"Tough luck!" Joslin murmured sympathetically. "When are you
back to New York?"</p>

<p>"Very soon, I expect. Unless I stay on here, as I think I
shall, and take a short holiday. I know exactly what will happen
to my charming companion. In another day, or perhaps two, he will
get up in the morning with either some new scheme in his mind,
all cut and dried, in which probably I sha'n't be interested, or
with his passage booked and reservations made for home."</p>

<p>"Can't think how you came to be mixed up with him," Joslin
observed.</p>

<p>Van Deyl shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"He was wished on me by the Department," he confided. "Costain
himself was very keen upon his success over here, and I fancy he
thought I might be helpful. But I've not been a damn' bit of good
to anybody."</p>

<p>"Come and have a swim," Joslin suggested. "A bite of luncheon
afterwards, if you like."</p>

<p>"I'm with you," the other acquiesced.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">WHEN at last Van Deyl left the raft and swam
lazily towards shore with pleasant thoughts of a cocktail and
lunch in front of him, he saw a familiar little figure waiting at
the top of the steps&mdash;a small commonplace looking man
dressed in expensive clothes, utterly out of touch with his
surroundings&mdash;an object of curiosity to every one. Van Deyl
abandoned the brief sunbath he had proposed for himself and
hurried on.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you are better, sir," he remarked. "Had a good
rest?"</p>

<p>Mr. Essenheim's thin lips curled in a peculiar smile.</p>

<p>"I do not rest," he said. "Since the time I saw you last I
have had forty-seven cables, twenty or thirty local telegrams,
the visit of a police Commissaire, a private detective and one of
our own Wilberforce men. I have now made my plans."</p>

<p>Van Deyl stared at him, speechless.</p>

<p>"You take my breath away, sir," he said at last.</p>

<p>"You are not of the type which understands rapid action," Mr.
Reuben C. Essenheim declared. "I have no complaint to make of
you. You did what you were expected to do. It failed. It was not
your fault. Here," he announced, drawing an envelope from his
pocket, "you will find dollar bills for all that I owe you, and
what I consider a fair amount over for expenses."</p>

<p>Van Deyl held the envelope in his salt wet fingers.</p>

<p>"And you," he asked curiously, "what are you going to do?
Return to America?"</p>

<p>Mr. Essenheim gravely removed his horn-rimmed spectacles. He
blinked for a moment and looked up at his questioner in blank
surprise.</p>

<p>"Go back to America?" he repeated. "Without the Great Eastern
shares? Do you imagine that I made my millions, young man, by
giving up things?"</p>

<p>"You have a nerve, sir," Van Deyl acknowledged. "If you get
those shares, I'll take off my hat every time I hear your
name."</p>

<p>Essenheim smiled queerly. He was watching the approach of a
motor boat rounding the point.</p>

<p>"There are more roads than one to success," he said. "Au
revoir, Mr. Van Deyl. I am going with my friend Commodore Jasen
to lunch at his ch&acirc;teau. I see he has come for me."</p>

<p>The little man in his business suit, so out of place in such
an environment, descended the stone steps with pompous
bearing&mdash;an object of amazement to every one. He stepped
into a dinghy and was rowed out to the motor boat which was
hovering round....</p>

<p>Joslin strolled up to Van Deyl and the two men stood together,
the sun blazing down unheeded upon their bare heads and the
seashine of their bodies.</p>

<p>"So the great Mr. Essenheim is a friend of Commodore Jasen's,"
Joslin said curiously.</p>

<p>"First I knew of it," Van Deyl replied.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">MR. REUBEN C. ESSENHEIM selected the most
sheltered spot in the motor boat and established himself in it
with some care.</p>

<p>"I am obliged to you, Commodore," he said, "for your
invitation to lunch, but I only eat once a day and I drink
nothing whatever. I have had three biscuits and a glass of
Perrier with a teaspoonful of brandy in it. That will last me
until evening. I wish to speak to you alone. Here we are alone.
What could be better? We talk for ten minutes, afterwards you go
back to your ch&acirc;teau and send me back to my hotel."</p>

<p>"Just as you wish," the Commodore replied, a little shattered.
"I can make you a cocktail here if you like."</p>

<p>"I never touch them," Mr. Essenheim protested. "Now,
Commodore, I came over to Europe for one reason and with one
intent. I wish to purchase, preferably at my price, otherwise at
his, four thousand three hundred and ninety shares in an American
Railway from a man who calls himself the Duke of Sousponnier. He
is so greedy about titles that occasionally he is known as the
Prince of St. Sa&euml;ns."</p>

<p>"I know him," the Commodore admitted. "I should never have
looked upon him as a likely owner of American Railway stock."</p>

<p>"He holds those shares," Mr. Essenheim went on, "and he
declines to part with them. He declines even to see me. I have
approached him at his ch&acirc;teau. Our lawyers have approached
him with what must seem to be a ridiculous offer. We have offered
him fifty dollars a share for shares that on the market would not
fetch twelve dollars. He simply refuses to do business."</p>

<p>"A most unreasonable man," the Commodore murmured. "A man in
constant ill-health, though. Before long you will probably find
those shares upon the market. If his is a French will, as I
daresay you know, every foreign share must be sold."</p>

<p>"Quite so," Mr. Essenheim agreed. "But the question
is&mdash;how long will he live? To me the question presents
itself&mdash;how long should a man of such obstinacy be allowed
to live?"</p>

<p>Into Commodore Jasen's blue eyes there suddenly flashed a
light of apprehension. For many hours he had been wondering what
this millionaire financier could be wanting with him.</p>

<p>"I am not a man," Essenheim continued, "who accepts failure. I
have agents everywhere&mdash;friends in other worlds who have
sometimes been useful to me. I am in touch even with the private
detective forces and Police Headquarters in my own country. The
wires have been buzzing round the H&ocirc;tel du Cap d'Antibes
while I have been lying in my room. One of the first things I
learnt, Commodore, was that a portion, at any rate, of the famous
Lebworthy Gang were supposed to be hovering around these
parts."</p>

<p>Still the Commodore made no remark. He tapped a cigarette upon
the hard seat and lit it.</p>

<p>"The Duke of Sousponnier," Mr. Reuben C. Essenheim went on,
"has offended me mortally. He refused to receive me. He left me
in a waiting room. I have never found, in the course of my life,
that it pays to allow men who have offended you to continue
unchallenged. He is a sick man, they tell me. Very
well&mdash;earlier or later, what does it matter? There is a
third point&mdash;he stands in the way of a great enterprise.
With antediluvian pig-headedness he blocks progress. A man like
that should go."</p>

<p>"You spoke of the Lebworthy Gang," Commodore Jasen ruminated.
"Have you any real reason to imagine that any of that desperate
crowd are in this locality?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest," was the emphatic response. "If they were
here, I should never know it, but I have taken out a mental
policy upon the life of the Duke of Sousponnier, and it would be
worth a hundred thousand dollars to the beneficiary."</p>

<p>"One hundred and fifty thousand dollars, I think," Commodore
Jasen murmured.</p>

<p>His companion sighed.</p>

<p>"Say, isn't that rather a tall order?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not at all," the Commodore assured him. "First of all, it
would be exceedingly difficult to get into touch with any of
these desperate fellows and secondly, well&mdash;we are not in
Chicago, are we?"</p>

<p>Mr. Reuben C. Essenheim took out a cheque-book from his pocket
and very carefully he made out a draft to self for a hundred and
fifty thousand dollars and endorsed it. He dated it a week
ahead.</p>

<p>"In a week," he observed, as he tore it out and passed it to
his companion, "I shall stop payment of this in Paris, but if by
any chance I should be owing that amount to the beneficiary of
that life insurance&mdash;well, the cheque could be cashed at any
time at the Paris branch of the Grand Prudential."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen thrust it carefully into his waistcoat pocket.
His guest pointed to the shore.</p>

<p>"If you can land me," he said, "I should be glad. I have
decided to move to Nice and I have ordered my car for two
o'clock. Bad news travels fast enough through the press,
Commodore. I shall not leave you my address."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">VAN DEYL was a cheerful and welcome addition to
Caroline's luncheon table at the Cap. He made no secret of his
admiration for Caroline and talked over old times with
Joslin.</p>

<p>"Tell me, what has become of your strange little friend?"
Caroline enquired.</p>

<p>Van Deyl smiled.</p>

<p>"He really isn't a bad sort. I was sent over from Washington
to help, if I could, in a scheme of his. I have not been able to
make good and he has given me the sack. Never mind, he did it
very graciously."</p>

<p>Both Caroline and Joslin were interested.</p>

<p>"Is he going home?" the former asked. "Has he really given up
his enterprise here, whatever it may have been?"</p>

<p>"He didn't tell me anything about his plans," Van Deyl
admitted. "He simply wished me to understand that I had had my
chance and failed and that he was going to carry on alone. With
that he left me. He embarked on that wonderful fast motor boat
with the nautical-looking gentleman with the white moustache, who
plays around here sometimes."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. Caroline shot one swift glance
across at Joslin and then looked out to sea.</p>

<p>"Commodore Jasen," the latter murmured.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is his name," Van Deyl observed carelessly. "Nice-
looking old duffer, but I don't see quite what use he is going to
be to my little friend."</p>

<p>Caroline was her old bewitching self as she leaned across the
table, her chin resting upon her clasped hands.</p>

<p>"It is your own fault, Mr. Van Deyl," she said, "if you have
made us curious. Of course, one knows what you have done during
the war, and your Washington work, and everything to do with
Secret Service is so fascinating, but when you come to connect
with a man like Essenheim&mdash;well, it does seem inexplicable,
doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Money," Van Deyl remarked thoughtfully, "is perhaps rather an
uninspiring power, but in our country, at any rate, it is a
mighty one. Essenheim is worth, I should think, forty millions.
For that he is, in his own circle, a kind of emperor. He commands
his friends. I am not sure whether he does not command the law. I
don't know," the young man reflected, "that there is any
particular secret about our mission here&mdash;certainly not
about my part in it. Essenheim has a great scheme for
reorganising a defunct railway. What's at the bottom of that is
the only secret in the matter, and that I can't tell you. For
certain reasons, the Government approve warmly of his scheme and
would very much like it carried out. That's why I came over to
help him."</p>

<p>"And you have failed?" Caroline asked sympathetically.</p>

<p>"We came across a man unlike any I have ever met before," Van
Deyl admitted frankly. "He holds four thousand three hundred and
ninety shares of the Great Eastern of Texas which we want, which
are certainly not worth more than ten dollars a share, if that,
and yielding him no dividends. He refused to sell them to-day at
fifty dollars!"</p>

<p>"Who on earth is this imbecile?" Caroline asked, trying to
keep the intense curiosity from her tone.</p>

<p>Van Deyl hesitated. After all, was there any secret about the
matter? He imagined not.</p>

<p>"A man calling himself the Duc de Sousponnier," he confided,
"also the Prince de St. Sa&euml;ns. He is already enormously
wealthy and he declines to either buy or sell a share of any
sort. He is writing a book and appears to think of nothing
else."</p>

<p>Caroline leaned back in her place. The excitement of the last
few minutes had been a strain on her nerves. She began now to see
daylight.</p>

<p>"What a lucky man you are, Mr. Van Deyl," she murmured, "to be
mixed up with such interesting affairs."</p>

<p>He made a grimace.</p>

<p>"Well, I've had to pay for it," he reminded her. "Essenheim
isn't every one's choice of a day-by-day companion."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose," she asked indifferently, "Mr.
Essenheim's new scheme is?"</p>

<p>Van Deyl shook his head.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine," he said. "The Duke is supposed to be in
very bad health, so I advised Essenheim to shelve the whole
thing. If the Duke were to die, the shares would come on the
market automatically. On the other hand, I don't think he has
taken my advice. He would not have entered into all this
correspondence and cabling without some object."</p>

<p>"It seems rather a queer anticlimax, doesn't it," Caroline
mused, gazing out seawards, "that after all these exhaustive
efforts, he should spend the morning going out to lunch with a
harmless old gentleman like Commodore Jasen?"</p>

<p>"If I were still interested," Van Deyl remarked, as he rose
with the others regretfully to his feet, "I should want to know
something more about Commodore Jasen."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">CAROLINE, that afternoon, picked her way through
a mass of d&eacute;bris and avoided with difficulty being
entangled with a crowd of workpeople, who were dealing with the
reconstruction of the Ch&acirc;teau de St. V&eacute;ran. She
found the Marquis, or Armand, as she now occasionally called him,
talking to an architect and his foreman. He abandoned them
precipitately, however, and hastened towards her.</p>

<p>"You are so welcome, dear Mees Caroline," he said, as he bent
over her hand. "For the renovations you come early. There is much
to be done before we can even commence."</p>

<p>"But you," she asked&mdash;"you are feeling some
interest?"</p>

<p>He smiled his assent. He was well and carefully dressed in
country clothes and he seemed once more a young man.</p>

<p>"It has come, that interest," he admitted. "You have awakened
it. I wish now, more than anything in the world, to make my home
once more like the Ch&acirc;teau of my fathers. Tell me, there is
something I can do for you perhaps, or you permit that we go in
search of Madame, and insist upon some English tea?"</p>

<p>She laughed at his somewhat anxious glance of enquiry.</p>

<p>"Of course you guess that I have come here for something. You
are quite right. Tell me, who is the Duc de Sousponnier who lives
at the marvellous ch&acirc;teau on the other side of the
valley?"</p>

<p>"Who is he?" the Marquis repeated. "Well, my uncle for one
thing, a great scholar for another, a very rich man for a
third."</p>

<p>"Do you ever see him?"</p>

<p>"Every week. He is passionately absorbed in a book he is
writing&mdash;on the Renaissance, I think&mdash;but,
nevertheless, he always receives any one of the family. I go to
pay my respects generally on Friday evenings. I always leave
feeling that he has remembered me quite wonderfully in his
testament, but up till lately I have wished, oh, so much, that he
would hand out a few hundred francs on account!"</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, you are past all that now."</p>

<p>"Thanks to you," he murmured.</p>

<p>"To-day is Friday," she reminded him.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"I shall probably go and see him this evening."</p>

<p>"Will you do something for me?" she begged.</p>

<p>"Why, of course I will. But do you mean with my uncle?"</p>

<p>"Naturally," she replied. "You know how fond I am of meddling
in other people's affairs!"</p>

<p>"Your interference in mine was the most fortunate thing that
ever happened," he rejoined.</p>

<p>"Well, then, have confidence in me," she said. "I want to buy
four thousand three hundred and ninety shares which your uncle
holds in an American Railway."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" the Marquis murmured. "Are they very good
shares?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she admitted. "I can only tell you
this&mdash;that if he were to get a report upon them to-day he
would be told that they were worth about twelve dollars. I would
like to give him twenty dollars. If you wish, I will divide any
profit I make with you <i>cinquante-cinquante</i>!"</p>

<p>"Feefty-feefty," he exclaimed with delight. "Are you serious,
Miss Caroline? My uncle is an impossible man with strangers but
to us of his family he is sometimes amenable."</p>

<p>"Buy me those shares, Armand," she wheedled, "and I will come
up and help you every other day with your decorations."</p>

<p>"I shall buy them," the Marquis declared. "I shall approach my
uncle with talk, but if necessary I shall use force. I will buy
them. Have no fear. You will have to find a good deal of
money."</p>

<p>"I have a good deal of money," she assured him.</p>

<p>The Marquis glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"Wait for me a short time here," he begged, "and you shall
accompany me. Alas, I cannot promise that my uncle will receive
you. I must leave you in the car. But you will have early news of
my effort, and&mdash;Mees Caroline&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"If I could go feefty-feefty with you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In this matter of the shares?"</p>

<p>"No. In yourself."</p>

<p>The architect blundered in, but that wistful look in her eyes,
the faint pressure of her fingers, was something.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">AN hour later the Marquis came down the broad
paved way from the entrance to the Ch&acirc;teau de Sousponnier
and passed through the wide-flung gates. Caroline had been
leaning back in the corner of the limousine, but she stepped
lightly out at his gesture.</p>

<p>"My uncle," he announced, "would be glad to have the honour of
receiving you. He is not in one of his best moods, I fear, but he
is at least gracious."</p>

<p>"I shall come now?" she asked.</p>

<p>"At once."</p>

<p>They went into the ch&acirc;teau, escorted by bowing servants,
passed without entering the dreary waiting room, which had so
much fretted Reuben Essenheim, and into the very beautiful
library where the Duke worked. He had left his seat at the desk
and was in an easy-chair, from which he rose at once at their
entrance. There was a smell of spring flowers about the place, of
violets, carnations and early roses, which haunted her for long
afterwards. The Duke himself looked old and ill.</p>

<p>"This is the young lady, Uncle," the Marquis announced. "You
permit, Mees Caroline, that I present my uncle, the Duc de
Sousponnier&mdash;Mees Caroline Loyd."</p>

<p>The Duke raised her fingers to his lips.</p>

<p>"You are the young lady whom, indirectly, my nephew has to
thank for the restoration of his family fortunes," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"Very indirectly, I am afraid," she replied. "Still, it has
been a great pleasure to me. It was wonderful coming across that
old document."</p>

<p>"I myself had heard of it," the Duke admitted. "We should have
searched. But there&mdash;we are not a business family. We are
rather by way of being fools, Miss Loyd, except sometimes a
little knowledge of art, perhaps, in the old days some skill of
soldiering. By-the-by, what is this my nephew tells me? You are
so much of this modern world&mdash;that you, a young lady of your
age, you wish to buy some shares?"</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"I do indeed," she told him. "I want to buy them for your
sake, too, as well as mine," she went on. "I think that so long
as you hold them, your life will be in danger."</p>

<p>The Duke looked at her curiously. This was a strange thing to
hear.</p>

<p>"My life!" he exclaimed. "How is danger to my life connected
with my holding these shares?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should not have gone so far as that," she
explained. "The only thing is, you see, that there are some
people who are desperately anxious to have them, who would pay
almost any price, and if you refuse to sell&mdash;well, nothing
but your death would bring them into the market."</p>

<p>"I see," he remarked. "You believe, then, that some one might
attempt my life?"</p>

<p>"I should not be surprised," she assured him.</p>

<p>He touched a bell.</p>

<p>"Charles," he asked his secretary, who hastened in from the
anteroom, "what shares were they that those strange people tried
to buy?"</p>

<p>"Four thousand three hundred and ninety Great Eastern Railway
of Texas," the young man replied. "They were bought at fifty.
They are now valued at anything between five and fifteen. The
company appears to be moribund."</p>

<p>"We have the documents themselves?" the Duke asked. "What is
it you call them&mdash;share certificates?"</p>

<p>"We have them in our own vault."</p>

<p>"Make up a parcel of them and present them to this young
lady," the Duke enjoined, a little wearily. "That will save my
being bothered about them any more."</p>

<p>"But we have not yet agreed about the price," Caroline
protested, a flash of triumph in her eyes.</p>

<p>"The price?" the Duke repeated. "I do not sell any of my
belongings, even my shares, Mademoiselle. They are yours with
great pleasure. Keep them, or do what you like with them, as a
slight memento of the services you were able to render to my
nephew. Are other documents necessary, Charles?"</p>

<p>"The transfer, which I will draw up, is all, Your Highness,"
the secretary replied. "They happen to be bearer bonds of an old-
fashioned type."</p>

<p>The Duke glanced over at his writing table.</p>

<p>"I shall see you on Sunday as usual, Armand," he said to his
nephew. "Mademoiselle, your visit has been a great pleasure."</p>

<p>He bent over her hand. Before Caroline quite realised what had
happened, she was in a small room with the secretary, who was
drawing up some papers and making out a sale sheet of the bonds.
He hurried out for a moment to obtain the Duke's signature. When
he returned, he handed her the packet.</p>

<p>"But it's impossible," Caroline declared. "I must give an
undertaking to pay a certain price for them."</p>

<p>The young man shook his head.</p>

<p>"It would not be wise to insist," he said. "The Duke would be
angry and very likely take them back again. Money means nothing
to him and he hates all form of barter. You need not hesitate,
Mademoiselle," he added. "If it were necessary at any time to
realise the Duke's belongings, he would be one of the richest men
in France."</p>

<p>"Will you do this for me?" she begged, as they walked across
the courtyard together towards the automobile. "I know that there
are some very desperate people in this country, who are so
anxious to obtain possession of these shares, or to see them upon
the market, that they might go to any lengths. Watch the Duke
closely to-night and to-morrow night."</p>

<p>The young man smiled.</p>

<p>"That sounds almost melodramatic," he observed.</p>

<p>"Never mind what it sounds like. Do it, please," she
implored.</p>

<p>"The young lady is of a sagacity most astounding," the Marquis
declared. "When she speaks of a thing she has knowledge."</p>

<p>Maurice inclined his head.</p>

<p>"Every precaution shall be taken," he promised, bowing them
into the automobile....</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of my uncle?" the Marquis asked, as
they drove away.</p>

<p>"You are both utterly and entirely ridiculous," she told him,
smiling. "You have lost touch with the world. You are survivals,
but you are adorable."</p>

<p>The Marquis leaned towards her. Caroline had laid her hand
gently upon his and he was very happy.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">COMMODORE JASEN was the soul of courtesy, as he
rose to receive his visitor. He moved a chair for her close to
his own upon the terrace and he knocked out the ashes from the
pipe which he had been smoking. Nevertheless, in his placid blue
eyes there was a sudden steely light. Commodore Jasen was on his
guard.</p>

<p>"My friend," Caroline began, "few words are best. Besides,
there is need for haste. Mr. Reuben C. Essenheim, I have no doubt
in the most indirect way possible, has yet placed a certain
proposition before you within the last few days."</p>

<p>"Mr. Essenheim?" Commodore Jasen repeated thoughtfully. "The
little man who lunched with me."</p>

<p>"Cut it out," Caroline enjoined sternly, with a touch of the
manner which she had outlived. "You know I'm not squeamish. I
would not interfere in any of your schemes to save a man's life
or his money, but you don't want to run risks for nothing, do
you? Mr. Essenheim wants the shares in the Great Eastern Railway
Company of Texas brought upon the market. Well, they are on the
market already. They don't belong to the Duc de Sousponnier any
longer; therefore, if by any chance a high-class burglary, with
accessories, were perpetrated to-night or any other night at the
Ch&acirc;teau de Sousponnier, it would simply be a washout. The
shares have been transferred to my name and they are in the
safety vault of the Bank in Juan-les-Pins where I have an
account."</p>

<p>The Commodore was impressed. There were many things for which
he hated Caroline, and there were a few for which he loved her,
but he knew very well that there was no one in the world less
likely to tell a falsehood.</p>

<p>"Now, Commodore," she went on, "you have not had the best of
luck out here. You are always complaining of me. I tell you I am
sick of the ordinary sort of adventure and I am thinking of
backing out. I shall hate you all my life for what you did to
Ned, and yet I know that what you did, you did according to the
code. Therefore, I forget it. Stop anything you may have started
against the Duke, and I will let you in upon this deal, fifty-
fifty."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen's slowly breaking smile was the pleasant
gesture of a great and benevolent man.</p>

<p>"You are yourself again, Caroline," he declared. "Later in the
day we will make our plans. It will take me a good many hours to
stop what has been started."</p>

<p>"I must know before eight o'clock that it has been stopped,"
she insisted, "or I will fill the Ch&acirc;teau de Sousponnier
with police."</p>

<p>"If I fail to stop it," the Commodore promised her earnestly,
"I will be there myself to prevent trouble."</p>

<p>Then there were many hours of strenuous search. The purlieus
of Nice and Beausoleil were carefully combed. Furious efforts
were made to pick up the trail which had been purposely dropped.
It was not until after ten o'clock that success was assured. A
fast motor boat came smoothly into the harbour at Nice and three
well-dressed but dangerous-looking young men stepped into a
waiting car and were driven to a small hotel close at hand. They
entered the dimly lit lounge to be confronted by a small group of
men who had the appearance of commercial travellers. There was a
moment of uncertainty, the glitter of dull electric light on dull
metal, as the foremost of the three newcomers took note of
various unexpected things. The sound of a familiar voice,
however, changed all that. Bottles of wine were brought and
emptied. A raid upon the dancing cabarets of Nice was planned. It
was disappointing, but all the same, a night of gaiety was well
enough in its way. The Ch&acirc;teau de Sousponnier and its
occupants remained undisturbed.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">MR. REUBEN C. ESSENHEIM left for New York three
weeks later with the missing shares in his despatch box, and his
great money-making scheme for the reorganisation of the Great
Eastern Railway of Texas already launched. Nevertheless, he had
met with new experiences and he was far from happy. He had met a
man who had refused to do business with him, a woman who was as
hard as himself in a deal, and he had been forced to leave behind
a million good American dollars, when he had expected to spend
fifty thousand. The fact that the little colony at the
Ch&acirc;teau d'Antibes were lighter-hearted and happier for his
brief visit failed entirely to alleviate his gloom, nor would it
have afforded him the slightest satisfaction if he had known that
the "feefty-feefty" negotiations between Caroline Loyd and the
Marquis had advanced a step further on his account.</p>

<p>Caroline and Armand de St. V&eacute;ran lay side by side upon
the rocks at the Cap d'Antibes. The shine of the sea was upon
their bodies and the exhilaration and joy of it in their hearts.
The Marquis was sometimes a little shy when he found himself
alone with this sweet but masterful young woman. To-day he found
courage.</p>

<p>"Miss Caroline," he said, "you have now so much money, and
soon, when the winter comes, I shall have a home which I dare
offer even to you if you do not want any more
adventures&mdash;no?"</p>

<p>She laid her hand upon his. Such small endearments were quite
in order at Eden Roc.</p>

<p>"Dear Armand," she said, "I am almost sure. Will you wait
until the summer is past?"</p>

<p>He turned round a little and his eyes watched the sunshine in
her hair.</p>

<p>"When I look at you," he murmured, "a day seems too long, but
when the summer is over, the Ch&acirc;teau will be finished, so I
will wait."</p>

<h2><a id="story6" name="story6">VI.&mdash;THE SEVEN TAVERNS OF
MARSEILLES</a></h2>

<h3>Published in <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i>, Aug 1932</h3>

<p class="first">"STOP!"</p>

<p>The single word, quivering through the pine-scented air,
sounded more like a hysterical command than an appeal. The terror
underlying it, however, and the sight of the slim, swaying figure
at the side of the road were enough for Commodore Jasen. He was
startled into no amateur indiscretions. To check a car travelling
at a hundred kilometres an hour, even along that perfect
Brignolles road, is a matter which needs unflurried nerves and
gentle manipulation. His foot depressed the foot brake but
gradually, his fingers drew the hand brake slowly but smoothly
towards him. The big Hispano rocked slightly, but within fifty
metres she was quivering stationary upon the road. A second or
two later she was in reverse and crawling backwards.</p>

<p>The girl who had hailed it, in dust-smothered motoring
clothes, with a streak of blood on one side of her face,
staggered forward from the roadside, and, with her hands clasping
the door of the car, leaned towards its driver. As she looked
into his face, her pale lips parted and closed again. Her eyes
grew larger&mdash;distended pools of shining light into which a
new and more poignant horror had crept. For, following swiftly
upon this crash into the darkness&mdash;this physical
d&eacute;b&acirc;cle&mdash;came the shock of recognition and of
ugly memory.... Commodore Jasen was remembering too. An ugly
business, this remembering! He thrust it back. The affair of the
moment pressed. He spoke to her as one wayfarer to another.</p>

<p>"What's wrong. Where's your car?"</p>

<p>She stood on one side and pointed downwards. The tree-bordered
road sloped almost perpendicularly some thirty feet into a field
of rough grass and bushes. At the bottom something was lying,
vast and chaotic in the darkness, a shapeless, impressive bulk
somehow whispering of tragedy. Commodore Jasen took from the case
by his side an electric torch, and, leaning over the closed door
of the car, flashed it downwards and around. The whole
catastrophe seemed to leap into being. There was the torn-up
fragment of the road, the barked tree, the broken saplings, the
overturned car&mdash;a grotesque sight, the nose of its bonnet
hard up against a splintered pine. On the ground, half hidden by
the coach-work, as though he had sprung out and missed his
footing, was the sprawling body of a man lying very still.</p>

<p>"He is dead," she whispered, finding speech at last.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" Jasen demanded.</p>

<p>"I felt his heart and his pulse. His neck is broken and he
fell on his face. He jumped too late."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"I fell out when we struck the tree. I was on the near side,
driving. Afterwards the car crashed down there."</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;who is he?"</p>

<p>"Go and see. Make sure for yourself that he is dead."</p>

<p>With the effort of speech and memory, the blood began to ebb
once more from her cheeks. She was a wild-looking sight in the
semi-darkness, her almost black eyes burning from their blanched
setting, her hair breaking loose on both sides from under her
b&eacute;ret. Commodore Jasen slipped from his place and lifted
her into the vacant seat by his side. He wiped the blood from her
cheeks with his handkerchief and just in time he forced the
nozzle of his flask of brandy between her lips. The spirit
gurgled in her throat. She lay back in her place, her arms
clasping the leather case which she had been carrying....</p>

<p>Her rescuer stumbled down the precipitous slope. Behind him,
on the hard road above, several cars thundered by, and each time,
as he heard their warning hoot, he extinguished his torch. He
reached the scene of the final disaster and bent over the body of
the dead man. He dropped on one knee by his side and, although
the few who knew Commodore Jasen spoke of him as a callous and
brutal person, his touch now was soft and gentle as a woman's. He
turned the body slightly and felt the heart&mdash;silent, as he
realised at once, for ever. Slowly his torch travelled up and
down. A bulky, ill-shaped man, flashily dressed in light tweeds,
with gold wrist watch, a diamond ring and other jewellery. The
night insects came and burred against the strange point of
intruding light, an owl called weirdly from the lower part of the
brushwood, but Commodore Jasen pursued his task and gratified his
curiosity without undue haste. He even seemed unperturbed when,
after the exercise of a slight effort, he succeeded in turning
the body a little on one side, and caught a glimpse at last of
the dead man's battered face....</p>

<p>Either Commodore Jasen was not so inured as he imagined to
horrible sights, or the climb back to the main road was probably
a little more severe than he had anticipated, for halfway up the
bank he paused and, raising his hand to his forehead, found that
unaccustomed sweat was pouring from his forehead down his cheeks.
He mopped his face carefully, corrected a slight giddiness which
had caused him to swerve from the path, and, in the act of
recovering his equilibrium, kicked some hard substance in the
undergrowth. A stone, without a doubt, he fancied. But,
nevertheless, it was a night of strange happenings. He flashed
his torch downwards&mdash;not on to the dull grey of a fallen
flint, but on to the brilliant, highly polished steel of a small,
almost a dainty, but at the same time a villainous-looking
revolver. He stooped and picked it up, turning it over almost
mechanically in his fingers, with the air of one well-used to
such trifles. It was a beautiful weapon and it bore the name of a
famous New York maker. He opened the breech and stared. There
were five cartridges duly in their places and one empty barrel,
and from that empty barrel came the faint sour odour of recently
exploded gunpowder....</p>

<p>"Please!"</p>

<p>It was the girl's cry again from the highroad. Commodore Jasen
answered it firmly and, with the weapon safely bestowed in his
coat pocket, scrambled up the remainder of the precipitous ledge.
The girl, once more a human being, leaned towards him from the
car. The questioning monosyllable broke from her lips.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"He's dead enough," was the grim response. "I should say there
never was a neck more completely broken."</p>

<p>The moon, although it had not yet altogether made its
appearance, was obscured now by only a thin film of misty cloud.
The intense darkness had passed, and, in the mysterious light, he
could see her face more clearly. He took note of the anguished
questioning of her pitiful eyes, but he made no further comment.
He took his place by her side and pressed the starting
button.</p>

<p>"What had I better do?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You seem to have done very well so far without advice," he
replied, and there was something more sinister than the
churlishness of the words themselves lurking underneath his silky
tone. She shivered, but his apparent unfriendliness seemed to be
no surprise to her. She sat rigidly in her place, whilst they
sped on through the darkness of the tree-tunnelled road. Once,
though the night was hot, she shook as though with cold, and he
turned towards her.</p>

<p>"Would you like a wrap?" he enquired.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I want nothing," she said in a low tone. "I should shiver if
I sat before a furnace."</p>

<p>"You have cause to fear," was his calm reply.</p>

<p>They drove on into Brignolles. Commodore Jasen pulled up in
front of a garage where he appeared to be known. The manager
hurried out to greet him.</p>

<p>"There has been a serious accident," the former confided,
"within a few yards of the seventeen-kilometre <i>borne</i> from
here. You must take a crane and a camion. You will find an
overturned car about twenty feet down in the field, with luggage
and a man&mdash;quite dead."</p>

<p>The garage man was voluble in his exclamations and questions,
but Commodore Jasen cut him short.</p>

<p>"I will go myself to the Gendarmerie," he continued. "All you
have to do is to salvage the car and bring the luggage to the
hotel. The police will see about removing the body of the
man."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen drove on to the Gendarmerie. He entered alone
and remained absent for some twenty minutes. As the time passed
by, the girl's nervousness returned. At the sound of every motor
horn she turned fearfully around, her still terrified eyes
fastened on the approaching car, until it had arrived within
recognisable distance, in some cases even until it had passed.
Her companion, upon his return, watched her for a moment from the
pavement. He made no remark, however, as he took his place in the
driving seat.</p>

<p>"They asked&mdash;many questions?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"The questions will come afterwards," he told her.</p>

<p>"Afterwards? That doesn't mean that I shall have to stay
here?"</p>

<p>"It certainly does," he assured her, as they glided down the
street. "The Commissaire insisted upon it and I gave my word that
you should. There is a good hotel just outside the town. One can
dine there and that is something."</p>

<p>"How far are we from Marseilles?" she asked.</p>

<p>"About eighty kilometres," he replied.</p>

<p>She gripped his arm.</p>

<p>"Take me back there," she begged.</p>

<p>He turned skilfully in at the wide-open gates of the hotel
gardens.</p>

<p>"That is quite impossible," he told her. "I have a friend to
meet here, and, apart from that, I have a few questions to ask
you myself."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE place presented an almost gala appearance.
At least a dozen tables upon the lawn were occupied by festive
groups of diners. There was popping of corks and laughter,
hurrying waiters, strings of fairy lamps enclosing the garden,
and softly shaded electric lights upon every table.</p>

<p>"This is terrible," the girl shuddered, leaning back in her
place. "I cannot bear the sight of all these people."</p>

<p>"Aren't you overdoing that stuff a little?" her companion
asked coldly. "I've seen you in Delaney's cellar, tuning a
mandolin, I think you were, and smoking a cigarette, with three
men stretched out, whom you knew slightly better, I fancy, than
your late passenger."</p>

<p>The girl made use of a violent French epithet.</p>

<p>"I had drugs then," she muttered. "I wish to the good God I
had now."</p>

<p>The car drew up before the door. The proprietor hastened out
and welcomed his guests with a respectful bow. Commodore Jasen,
it appeared, was well known.</p>

<p>"This young lady has been involved in a motor accident," her
escort explained. "We may have to remain here for the night, in
which case we shall require two rooms with baths. In the
meantime, we will have that table under the trees for
dinner&mdash;what you will, but a <i>poulet de maison</i> and a
bottle of Chambertin '11&mdash;in an hour. The young lady, I am
sure, would like to mount to her room and be quiet for a
time."</p>

<p>"Excellent, Monsieur," the <i>patron</i> murmured, with a bow.
"The rooms are at your disposal and my wife will look after the
young lady. The wine I shall decant with my own hands."</p>

<p>"I will send you some of my toilet requisites when I have
parked my car," Commodore Jasen promised, turning to the girl.
"We will meet in an hour's time."</p>

<p>She turned in silence to follow the landlord upstairs. On the
first landing she paused and, her fingers gripping the
windowsill, she looked with strained eyes out on to the Route
Nationale. Whilst she watched, no car turned in at the gate. She
remained there, however, without any sign of movement.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," her conductor ventured at last.</p>

<p>She started and turned reluctantly away from the window.</p>

<p>"I come," she muttered.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">WHEN he descended into the lounge, Commodore
Jasen stared at his prospective dinner companion in amazement. He
saw a slip of a girl, sixteen or seventeen years old she seemed
at the most, as thin as a lath, with dead white face, large be-
ringed eyes and a short black fringe. She sprang from her chair
as he entered and took his arm.</p>

<p>"Even though you are angry with me," she said, "even though
you are my enemy, I am glad you have come. I hate to be alone.
Can we go into the garden? I have seen your table. It is quite
hidden. I want to go there."</p>

<p>They threaded their way amongst the festive company, across
the lawn to the retired table which she had found so attractive.
A soft wind had blown away the clouds and the moon now rose high
in the sky. She drew her chair around so that her back was
towards the entrance. The palms of her hands framed her cheeks,
her elbows rested upon the table, her eyes shone into his.</p>

<p>"Dear Master-in-chief of our noble profession," she murmured,
"my faith is in you. I have lost my fear. You shall be my
protector."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen scrutinised the <i>hors d'oeuvres</i> with a
mildly dissatisfied expression.</p>

<p>"Some of that excellent <i>jambon de Parme</i> which I saw
when I came in," he told the waiter, "and also the
<i>p&acirc;t&eacute; maison</i>. We will take one glass of dry
Chablis with the fish&mdash;the Chablis '21&mdash;and the
Chambertin with the chicken."</p>

<p>The man departed with an appreciative bow. Like all French
<i>ma&icirc;tres d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, he admired a client who was
interested in his food. The girl pouted.</p>

<p>"I was inviting you to become my protector," she complained,
"and you occupy yourself with your wine."</p>

<p>"My dear Jenny," he replied in his soft, measured tone, "I am
not sure whether I am a candidate for the post of your protector.
You are a very charming young lady and it may be that you have
some claims upon my protection, but you are undisciplined and
disobedient. Is it not so? Besides, you have pulled down the
lightnings during the last few hours. Your protector of to-day
will need all his brain and all his courage&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have both," she declared, "and you have the great
advantage&mdash;you have never been found out. You are the
popular Commodore Jasen of the Ch&acirc;teau d'Antibes, whom
every one knows and every one visits. I am the poor little
<i>gamin</i> of New York and Paris and Marseilles. Still, our
profession is the same, and it is right that you should protect
me. And, after all," she added, with a wicked little gleam in her
eyes, "you are not so old, nor am I so young."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen was very much unmoved. He indulged in a little
bow, however, as he raised his glass to his lips.</p>

<p>"There will be serious matters for our discussion after
dinner," he observed. "In the meantime, I suggest that we abandon
all unpleasant thoughts. They interfere with digestion, which,
for a person of my age and habits, is an important
consideration."</p>

<p>Jenny shrugged her shoulders and chatted airily away,
sometimes patting her companion's hand, often laughing into his
face. To the scattered little groups of diners the two presented
an amusing problem. The elderly, benevolent-looking gentleman,
with the aristocratic white moustache, the sunburned kindly face,
and his&mdash;what? His niece perhaps. Scarcely his
daughter&mdash;the types were too different. Or was it perhaps a
tardy excursion of bored respectability into the world of
flapperdom? The girl had a wicked grace of her own. More than one
of the diners hoped that the pleasant-looking elderly gentleman
would take care of himself....</p>

<p>One by one the tables were vacated and the lights
extinguished. In the course of time Commodore Jasen and his
companion were the only two diners left. With the passing of on-
lookers that benevolent expression and the kindly light in his
eyes faded from the former's face. He seemed like a transformed
being. With steady fingers he turned out the electric lamp which
was burning on the table. The moonlight, coming only in patches
through the boughs of the tree under which they sat, was now the
only illumination. The faces of the two gleamed white in the
semi-darkness. The girl, lighting a cigarette, laughed at him
across the table. After the choicely cooked dinner, the rare old
wine and the Armagnac brandy she had drunk with her coffee, she
had regained her courage.</p>

<p>"You should regard far more kindly your little Jenny, <i>mon
vieux</i>," she remonstrated. "Once I was altogether in your
service. You were different then&mdash;in New York, <i>par
exemple</i>."</p>

<p>He ignored her protest completely.</p>

<p>"Whilst you were attending to your very effective toilet," he
confided deliberately, "the gendarmes came here."</p>

<p>She withdrew the long cigarette holder from between her
lips.</p>

<p>"Why not?" she observed. "It is their business."</p>

<p>"Naturally," he agreed. "They wished, of course, to question
you. I explained that you were in a very nervous and incoherent
state and begged them to give you an hour or so in which to
recover yourself."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to tell them beyond what you know," she
asserted sharply. "Why could you not have told them so and got
rid of them?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately they wished to hear the story from your own
lips," he said. "They may be here at any moment. Before they
come, I have a word or two to say."</p>

<p>"Say it with words of love, <i>cher ma&icirc;tre</i>," she
begged, caressing his hand, and leaning with her slim, subtle
body a little farther across the table.</p>

<p>The flash of her glorious eyes left him unmoved.</p>

<p>"It is the business of men like myself and girls like
yourself, I presume, to watch for fools," he said. "We fulfil the
natural law of the world&mdash;the strong prey upon the
weak."</p>

<p>"Is it not that you are being long-winded?" she yawned. "I
should like a glass of water."</p>

<p>"Presently," he replied. "You will probably need it. Talking
about the weak&mdash;you know, I daresay, that Steven Cotes was
one of my men."</p>

<p>"Surprising," she murmured. "I cannot understand how you could
put up for even a month with such a loose-mouthed, boasting
imbecile. Even after to-day, even thinking of him as I saw him
last, I can feel no pity for him."</p>

<p>"Let me tell you a story, or perhaps I should say, refresh
your memory, about Steven Cotes," he begged.</p>

<p>She was true to her disposition. She turned upon him like a
flash, her lips were quivering, her eyes angry.</p>

<p>"Why trouble? I hate your smooth ways. You are like a cat,
sitting there purring, but waiting to pounce on me. I know all
about Steven Cotes. He was the braggart who swore, upon the
steamer coming over to Europe, that he would visit alone the
seven taverns of Marseilles&mdash;one a night for seven
nights&mdash;with the whole of his fortune in his pocket,
and&mdash;what do you say?&mdash;get away with it. Well, he
visited six of them all right. After the seventh he got what was
coming to him."</p>

<p>"You are remarkably, quite remarkably well-informed," Jasen
admitted.</p>

<p>"Shut up," the girl enjoined feverishly. "I am well-informed
because I was there&mdash;and you know it."</p>

<p>"You make my task easier," he confided. "You make it almost
pleasant. Let me indulge in a brief effort of
reconstruction."</p>

<p>The girl was becoming a bundle of nerves again. She was white
and shivering. She swung her chair round so as to command a view
of the entrance gates and she herself gave the single waiter left
an order. Her companion shook his head.</p>

<p>"Very unwise to lose control of yourself," he murmured.
"Remember that the Commissaire of Police will be here before long
to question you."</p>

<p>"What is there in that which I should fear?" she exclaimed
angrily. "All that I have to confess is that I went to sleep
driving the car. I had too much wine, I suppose. I got more and
more sleepy. I spoke to him. He did not answer. He too was
asleep. I told him that I must stop, that he must drive. Still he
did not answer, and so I drove on, and I found myself rocking in
the seat, and I went to sleep. It was terrible, but it was not a
crime."</p>

<p>"No, to go to sleep was not a crime," he acknowledged. "You
have nothing to fear on that account, of course. Sometimes,
however, the police ask strange questions."</p>

<p>"What questions could they ask?" she demanded, with stealthily
interrogating eyes.</p>

<p>He ignored her for the moment, leaning further back in his
chair, and gazing dreamily through the starkly motionless boughs
of the tree beneath which they were seated, to the deep blue
sky.</p>

<p>"Reconstructions always fascinate me," he confessed. "I can
see the tawdry disorder of that seventh caf&eacute; down the
half-made street by the canal. Two or three men had been drunk
and there had been a fight. I am afraid Steven himself had helped
to make what he called a rough house. A strong man, Steven, and
much too clever with his fists.... He paid his bill and swaggered
out into the watery twilight. Can't you see him grinning to
himself? He had won his wager. This was the seventh tavern of
Marseilles in which he had spent a night, drank and danced at
will, carrying all the time with him, sewn up in his clothes, a
quarter of a million dollars, and two revolvers, neither of which
he had been called upon to use. He had won his wager. Twenty
thousand dollars to come to him from the boys! He strode along
the narrow street, cautious even in that moment of his triumph.
He knew perfectly well that he was being followed&mdash;it had
happened nearly every night&mdash;but his hand was resting upon
his hip pocket, and the night birds of Marseilles prefer to
settle their little affairs at closer quarters. There would be
plenty of time if that slouching figure drew near enough to him
for a spring."</p>

<p>"Who was he&mdash;the man who followed?" she demanded
breathlessly.</p>

<p>"One of my legion&mdash;a clumsy fellow&mdash;but it was his
duty not to let Steven out of his sight. Steven was too clever
for him, though. Almost a pity he isn't here now with you, isn't
it, Jenny, counting over his fortune?"</p>

<p>She shuddered.</p>

<p>"Will you finish with this ghastliness?" she begged. "It leads
to nowhere that I can see, and I do not find it amusing."</p>

<p>Her companion's eyebrows were slightly raised. Then suddenly
he abandoned his deprecating air, his tone of faint banter. He
spoke seriously.</p>

<p>"Steven mounted the hill towards the boulevard which, if he
had ever reached it, would have meant safety. As he passed a
small, disreputable caf&eacute;, from which was straggling out
the last of its clients, a girl, very chic, very attractive in
appearance, richly dressed, such a girl as he had not seen in his
seven nights' wanderings, emerged from the door. She crossed the
pavement, she was in the act of entering a waiting taxicab, when
she saw Steven within a few yards of her. She swung round, her
hand upon her hip, the light of scrutiny in her eyes, perhaps the
ghost of a smile upon her lips. Steven was a fine fellow, even at
the end of a wild night, and she approved of him. She stood away
from the open door of the taxicab and extended her hand towards
its interior in a gesture of invitation.</p>

<p>"'If Monsieur will please to pay for the taxi,' she suggested,
'I will drive him to his hotel. For myself, I am short of the
little money.'"</p>

<p>"Daylight had come, his wager was won, this meeting certainly
had the appearance of being entirely accidental. Steven raised
his hat gallantly and followed this extraordinarily attractive
young woman. The taxicab drove off. Where to? Who knows? You,
without a doubt, but who else? In a sense, I suppose, Steven had
won his wager, but he will never seek payment."</p>

<p>"See here," she said. "You talk a great deal. Now it is my
turn. Steven Cotes made this foolish bet in the smokeroom of the
steamer and in very dangerous company. From the moment he had
made it, he became the mark of all of us. Steven Cotes was once
your man, it is true, and you resented it. You were in the hunt.
You had a man in Marseilles&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I had a man upon that boat," Commodore Jasen interrupted
softly. "It was he who suggested the bet. I placed him there,
because I knew that Steven had never paid up his share of the
last enterprise we had together. He had a little more money than
was good for him."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"You have told the story very fairly," she admitted, "but with
everything in your favour you failed and I succeeded.
<i>Voil&agrave; tout!</i>"</p>

<p>"Not quite all," her companion protested, shaking his head.
"It is true that you succeeded. It may be true that I
failed&mdash;but here I am. What is your proposal?"</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"I have none," she declared. "That is final. You failed. I
succeeded. You must make the best of it."</p>

<p>The Commodore sighed.</p>

<p>"Alas, dear Jenny!" he said almost tenderly. "You misapprehend
the situation. In a few minutes at the most the Commissaire will
be here. You will be questioned again about the accident."</p>

<p>"What does it matter?" she demanded. "Again I say that it is
no crime to fall asleep."</p>

<p>Then the Commodore thrust his hand into his trousers pocket,
and, with great deliberation, produced that small, that elegant,
but very deadly-looking revolver.</p>

<p>"Five chambers loaded, you see," he remarked, "and one empty.
The bullet from that one is somewhere in Steven Cotes' head."</p>

<p>"Where did you find that?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"In the long grass amongst the bushes, about twenty yards from
the car. An inadequate hiding place, my dear young lady."</p>

<p>In the dim light she seemed to have lost all her beauty. Her
pale face was drawn and twisted as though with pain. Only her
eyes, contracted though they were, still glowed, and in those
eyes was the barely concealed light of murder.</p>

<p>"What made you notice?" she asked in a low tone. "I thought,
after that awful fall&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," he interrupted quickly. "It was the singeing of his
beard made me look. Then I found the small hole."</p>

<p>"Don't!" she stopped him.</p>

<p>There was a brief silence. For a moment all life seemed to
have gone out of her.</p>

<p>"What is it that you propose?" she asked at length.</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen lit another cigar with great care and
reflected for several moments.</p>

<p>"In that shabby little despatch case," he remarked at last,
waving his hand towards it, "which you are very wise not to let
out of your sight, you have fifty notes of five thousand dollars
each."</p>

<p>"But no," she interrupted sharply. "Steven changed one at
Marseilles."</p>

<p>"Forty-nine then," he conceded. "I think it would be a
graceful act on my part to accept forty-eight and to leave you
five thousand dollars as a memento of this interesting
adventure."</p>

<p>For an instant she seemed about to spring upon him, her fists
clenched, her bosom heaving. With a great effort she restrained
herself.</p>

<p>"I will consent to an equal partition," she announced.</p>

<p>He smiled in pitying fashion. The lights of a rapidly driven
car flashed along the avenue and drew up in front of the hotel
with a grinding of brakes and a rain of small pebbles against the
mudguard. Its single occupant descended and came rapidly across
the lawn.</p>

<p>"It is the Commissaire," Jasen said quietly. "Ten thousand for
you&mdash;otherwise the truth."</p>

<p>She passed the shabby despatch case to him underneath the
table.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE newcomer, a tall, spare man in a black suit
and a bowler hat, came hurriedly to the table.</p>

<p>"Pardon&mdash;it is the young lady who was concerned in the
catastrophe on the Route Nationale? I introduce myself&mdash;I am
the Commissaire of Police of Brignolles."</p>

<p>"We have been expecting you, Monsieur le Commissaire,"
Commodore Jasen replied. "This is the young lady of whom you are
in search. She is more composed now and will be able to furnish
you with an account of the accident."</p>

<p>"A little later," was the breathless reply. "For the moment
time presses. I come in great haste. The man whom we believed to
be dead was in a critical state, and is without a doubt dying,
but he has unexpectedly recovered consciousness."</p>

<p>"What?" the Commodore gasped. "Alive?"</p>

<p>"You are telling us that he is alive?" the girl screamed.</p>

<p>"A life that hangs upon a thread," the other explained. "He is
about to make a statement, but he asks always for his despatch
case. Ah, forgive me&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped and picked up the brown wallet leaning against the
Commodore's chair, turned it over and tucked it under his
arm.</p>

<p>"The doctor fancied that it might quieten him to see it," he
continued, "although he certainly will not be able to examine its
contents. My opinion is that he is dead by now, in which event I
will bring the case back, when I come to hear Mademoiselle's
story. I will promise not to detain you for longer than half an
hour, but Monsieur and Mademoiselle will be so good as to await
my return?"</p>

<p>They murmured acquiescence. The Commissaire saluted stiffly
and hurried off to his waiting car. For once in his life,
Commodore Jasen appeared to be overcome with surprise. The girl
was paralysed with fear. Steven Cotes alive! Even at that moment
he might be accusing her of murder.</p>

<p>"I have heard of miracles and I have seen strange things in
the hospital," the Commodore said at last, "but never have I
heard of a man in Steven Cotes' condition coming back to
life!"</p>

<p>The girl was speechless. Her mind had wandered back through
the hours. She saw the flying milestones whilst she sat by his
side, her concealed hand grasping the butt of her deadly little
weapon. Under the beard where no one would see! That was the
place. She remembered the very second when she had finally found
her courage. Even then she would have drawn back, as she had done
several times before, but this time she would have been too late.
He had caught some faint apprehension of her sinister movement.
His head was turning, his foot slackening upon the accelerator.
He had time to grunt&mdash;a hideous sound it was&mdash;as he
felt the cold steel upon his throat. Then she had pulled the
trigger.... Ugh!&mdash;A statement! Perhaps it was made by this
time. She began to shiver violently.</p>

<p>Her companion had summoned a waiter and was paying his bill.
He tipped the man generously and enlarged upon the excellence of
the dinner. Smiles and compliments were exchanged, for Commodore
Jasen was well known as a generous, although infrequent, visitor.
The man took reluctant leave and Jasen felt the girl's icy
fingers gripping his wrist. Her panic-stricken eyes pleaded with
his.</p>

<p>"Take me away," she begged. "Take me to Marseilles. I can hide
there."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen sighed drearily as he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Forty-seven grands gone west," he lamented. "If only you
women would leave off trying to do men's jobs!"</p>

<p>"Take me away," she implored, clinging to his arm. "It must be
to Marseilles. I am safe there from all the police in France. I
shall live there like a sewer rat, but they will never find
me."</p>

<p>"Very well," he assented. "I will do my best for you, Jenny.
Wait here while I fetch the car."</p>

<p>He took a single step towards the avenue and stopped short on
the edge of the grass. It was partly Jenny's stifled cry of agony
which brought him to a standstill, partly the sight of the car
turning in at the avenue, the lights flashing upon the uniforms
of the two gendarmes behind. He turned and caught Jenny by the
arm.</p>

<p>"Pull yourself together," he enjoyed sternly. "Remember, any
one living our life must be prepared to face a crisis like this
now and then. I will be responsible for the pistol. From what I
remember of the man's condition, they will never be able to swear
to that pistol shot."</p>

<p>The girl nodded. In the presence of real danger she was a
different person. They moved forward, entered the hotel and
awaited their visitors in the lounge. One only of the three men
who had been in the car presented himself. The gendarmes remained
outside.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle and Monsieur," the former began gravely, "I must
beg for a few minutes of your time over this very serious and
important affair."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle is only too anxious to offer you all the
information possible," Commodore Jasen assured him. "I myself
have little to tell you, for I did not arrive upon the scene
until after the accident. First of all, though, relieve our
minds&mdash;the condition of the unfortunate man? There is still
hope perhaps?"</p>

<p>The newcomer was apparently puzzled. His stiff figure was
drawn upright, his black eyes flashed enquiringly from one to the
other.</p>

<p>"I regret, Monsieur," he said. "I fail to understand. Hope of
what?"</p>

<p>"That the man may live," Commodore Jasen explained.</p>

<p>"The man who was in the motor accident?"</p>

<p>"But naturally."</p>

<p>The other shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>"The man was dead when we found him," he pronounced. "His neck
was broken and he was suffering from terrible wounds in the head.
I do not understand how Monsieur or Mademoiselle could have
entertained any hopes of his recovery."</p>

<p>The girl seemed quicker of understanding than her companion.
Already she was pacing the room with the fury of a caged tiger.
The Commodore appeared to be groping his way towards the
truth.</p>

<p>"You are, I presume, the doctor?" he ventured. "Why do you
come instead of the Commissaire?"</p>

<p>The little man stared at the speaker.</p>

<p>"I," he announced, "am the Commissaire of Police of this
district."</p>

<p>Then Commodore Jasen too had the air of one upon whom an
unpleasant truth is slowly dawning.</p>

<p>"Barely a quarter of an hour ago," he confided, "a man arrived
here in a motor car, assuring us that he was the Commissaire of
the district. He took from Mademoiselle a despatch box belonging
to the unfortunate man who, he declared, was still alive and
wished to make a statement."</p>

<p>The Commissaire touched his short moustache with a scornful
gesture.</p>

<p>"Monsieur has been deceived," he said. "I am the only
Commissaire of Police in Brignolles, and the man who met with the
motor accident was as dead as Julius Caesar when my gendarme
found him. And since, Monsieur," he continued, "dead men do not
make statements, it follows that your visitor was a liar."</p>

<p>"And we," Commodore Jasen groaned, "are simpletons."</p>

<p>"That is as it may be," the little man observed. "In the
meantime, as a matter of form, I will ask Mademoiselle a few
questions concerning the accident. The affair is so simple that I
shall not detain her long."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">IT was a very depressed Jenny who parted from
Commodore Jasen the next morning outside the door of the
Splendide H&ocirc;tel at Marseilles. The latter, however, entered
the place with all his accustomed briskness and good humour. He
was warmly welcomed by the concierge and shook hands with the
reception clerk. He was obviously well known and liked&mdash;a
client who, on his not infrequent visits, chose the most
expensive rooms and tipped well and graciously. In reply to his
enquiry he was conducted at once to a salon on the first floor.
Its single occupant&mdash;a tall, well-dressed young man of spare
figure&mdash;rose to his feet at once. Commodore Jasen greeted
him cheerfully and made sure about the door.</p>

<p>"All serene?" he enquired, without overmuch interest, for the
plans of Commodore Jasen very seldom went wrong.</p>

<p>"Perfectly," the young man, who bore a striking resemblance to
the pseudo-Commissaire of Brignolles, announced. "The money is
here. The bag and the rest of its contents are destroyed."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen counted the money, selected two notes of five
thousand dollars each, pushed them across the table to his
companion and pocketed the rest.</p>

<p>"We will drink a bottle of wine together, George," he said.
"Afterwards, I shall ask you to have the goodness to see that
those two notes are handed to Mademoiselle Jenny with my
compliments."</p>

<h2><a id="story7" name="story7">VII.&mdash;COMMODORE JASEN
WATCHES HIS STEP</a></h2>

<h3>Published in <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i>, Sep 1932</h3>

<p class="first">A PAGE BOY in resplendent livery paused before
Commodore Jasen of the Ch&acirc;teau d'Antibes, who was
entertaining a couple of promising acquaintances in the new
reception room of the H&ocirc;tel de Paris.</p>

<p>"One demands Monsieur le Commodore upon the telephone," he
announced.</p>

<p>Jasen rose unwillingly to his feet.</p>

<p>"What name?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"Madame gave no name," the boy replied. "The call, she
declared, was urgent."</p>

<p>"Where was it from?" was the impatient query.</p>

<p>"L'H&ocirc;tel du Cap d'Antibes."</p>

<p>The Commodore hesitated no longer, but excused himself to his
friends and was shepherded to the box just outside the door. He
picked up the receiver and announced himself.</p>

<p>"Commodore Jasen speaking," he said. "Who is it, please?"</p>

<p>"Caroline Loyd," was the prompt reply. "Can you hear me?"</p>

<p>The change in the Commodore's tone was amazing. All his
indifference and irritability seemed to have faded away. He spoke
with the utmost <i>empressement</i>.</p>

<p>"My dear Caroline," he exclaimed, "what a pleasure! I heard
that you were in Paris."</p>

<p>"Listen," the voice at the other end replied. "I wish to see
you, and they told me at the Ch&acirc;teau that you were at Monte
Carlo. I am coming in to a special performance at the Opera House
to-night and I will be in the lounge of the hotel at a quarter
past seven. It must be at that time because I dine early with a
friend."</p>

<p>There was a bitter look for a moment in Jasen's face but no
reflection of it in his suave and eager tone.</p>

<p>"I shall be there," he agreed....</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen returned to the task of cementing his
acquaintance with two swarthy-faced, glossy-haired Argentines of
reputed wealth but with undue gambling propensities. They had
made very few friends in the Principality, and had been somewhat
flattered by the attentions of this American millionaire of
benevolent appearance, who was evidently a well-known and highly
respected personage. They hailed his return with acclamation, and
the senior of the two&mdash;Se&ntilde;or Jos&eacute; de
Santador&mdash;played their trump card in the game of achieving
popularity. He indicated a very attractive young woman of the
distinctly Spanish type who had just joined them, a young woman
of very elegant appearance with her tightly fitting black dress,
her ivory white skin, her dark expressive eyes and judiciously
becarmined lips, which were already smiling at the newcomer.</p>

<p>"You permit that I present you to my sister?" he begged. "The
Commodore Jasen&mdash;Miss Juanita de Santador."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen, who, when it did not interfere with the more
serious things of life, was a fine and critical judge of the
other sex, bowed over the girl's fingers, returned smile for
smile, and decided that, should his acquaintance with these two
young men develop in the matters of which they had spoken, the
whole business would be a great deal more agreeable for Miss
Juanita's association with it. A dangerous trio, the acute and
suspicious man of the world might have remarked of Jos&eacute; de
Santador, Rodriguez de Santador and their beautiful sister. But
Commodore Jasen himself was no lambkin.</p>

<p>"You will do us the great pleasure of joining us?" the latter
begged, Juanita's hand still in his.</p>

<p>The invitation was cordially and gracefully accepted.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">AT a quarter past seven precisely, Caroline
Loyd, looking very beautiful indeed, followed by her devoted
friend, the Marquis de St. V&eacute;ran, descended from a car and
passed through the entrance doors of the H&ocirc;tel de Paris
into the spacious and handsome lounge. Commodore Jasen, who had
been awaiting the arrival of the former, rose at once to his
feet, a trim and agreeable figure in his well-cut dinner clothes.
His black silk tie was a trifle larger than the fashion of the
moment decreed, but admirably arranged and impressive. His black
opal studs and links, his general air of benign good-nature
completed a most attractive <i>tout ensemble</i>. To the casual
observer, his smile, as he raised the girl's hand to his lips,
was gentle and gracious. The girl, however, knew him well, and
she had seen with a pang of dread the swift, rapidly veiled gleam
of anger in his eyes as he had recognised her companion. It was
gone in a second. Nothing could have been more courteous and
friendly than his greetings.</p>

<p>"Delighted to see the Marquis," he said cordially. "One hears
amazing things of the progress they are making with the
reconstruction of your ch&acirc;teau."</p>

<p>"My architect is a marvel," the other replied graciously. "I
trust that some day you will accompany Miss Loyd on a tour of
inspection."</p>

<p>"It would give me a great pleasure," the Commodore
declared.</p>

<p>"If Mademoiselle permits," the Marquis suggested, "I will,
whilst she exchanges a few words with you, occupy myself in
ordering dinner. It is a somewhat barbarous hour to dine, but
with music before us one forgives."</p>

<p>"A very light dinner, please," Caroline begged.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle shall be obeyed."</p>

<p>He left them, with a courteous little gesture of farewell, to
meet the <i>ma&icirc;tres d'h&ocirc;tel</i> who were already
hovering in the background. Caroline looked after him with a
smile at the corner of her lips and a faint sense of personal
pride in his complete re&euml;stablishment. Commodore Jasen also
looked after him, but with eyes of hate.</p>

<p>"The Marquis is a very changed man," the latter observed
quietly.</p>

<p>"Who would not be?" she agreed. "I did not bring you here,
however, to discuss his affairs."</p>

<p>"You have a proposition?" he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," she replied. "To be frank, I doubt whether I
shall ever have another or the will to listen to one. I am not
ambitious for great wealth and I think that the love of
adventure, as I used to understand adventure, is leaving me."</p>

<p>"Then to what do I owe this pleasure?"</p>

<p>"I asked you to meet me here in order to warn you," she
confided.</p>

<p>He raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"That sounds mysterious," he observed.</p>

<p>"Please do not be sarcastic," she begged. "I know that you are
as clever as Satan, but there's one thing that I don't think you
<i>do</i> know."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I do not think you know that Lavalon, the French detective,
who became so famous last year and is now head of his service,
and Brant, the New York man who nearly got poor Jim, are at the
present moment in the bar of this hotel."</p>

<p>The face of Commodore Jasen became like the face of a sphinx.
No one could have told whether it was fear or indifference which
had chilled the blood in his cheeks. It would have been hard
indeed for any one to guess whether his companion's disclosure
was news to him.</p>

<p>"How do you know this?" he demanded.</p>

<p>She smiled. It was one of those small moments of triumph which
nowadays meant nothing to her.</p>

<p>"There are times," she observed, "when my secret service is
better than yours. It was Dick Ferber, the last of my staff
except Ralph, who had word from Marseilles. He is in Italy by
this time. He was up against Brant in that Springfield bank
affair, and Brant knows him."</p>

<p>"Why are you so certain that they are in the bar at the
present moment?"</p>

<p>"I saw them as we passed by. The windows were all open. Of
course, I should not have noticed them had I not known they were
in Monte Carlo. Now let me tell you the rest. There are some
Argentines here&mdash;two men and a girl. Brant and Lavalon are
interested in them."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen leant towards his companion. There was a light
in his eyes which might almost have been described as dreamy. His
manner, if not exactly paternal, might well have been described
as avuncular.</p>

<p>"You are a young woman of brains, Caroline," he said. "You
have sometimes soared up above the possibilities of dull grey
matter&mdash;you have displayed inspiration. You have set me a
puzzling problem. What do you make of it yourself?"</p>

<p>"I have not even attempted to study it," she confessed. "I am
simply passing on to you facts which have become known to
me."</p>

<p>"I have already clicked with the Argentines," Jasen meditated,
"but up till now I am uncertain whether they are useful fish for
my net, or whether they are fancying that a genial&mdash;and
possibly susceptible&mdash;American millionaire has not been sent
by Providence to enlarge their own banking account."</p>

<p>"The girl is attractive?" Caroline asked.</p>

<p>"I only met her this afternoon," Jasen confided, "but I should
say amazingly so."</p>

<p>"That," Caroline suggested, with a glance towards the
restaurant, "should make the situation more intriguing for
you."</p>

<p>"The personal side of it is scarcely worth considering,"
Commodore Jasen pronounced. "Not, at any rate, until one has the
affair focussed. In the background we have the more sinister
figures of Lavalon and Brant. Who are they after? Do they
realise, I wonder, that they are at last almost in touch with the
most famous criminal who has never yet entered the dock or
crossed the threshold of a prison? If they do, the Argentines
might well be their decoy. On the other hand, the Argentines
might be well worth looking after for their own sakes. It is a
pretty problem."</p>

<p>Caroline, conscious of her escort waiting patiently in the
background, rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"I have set the pieces," she said, with a nod of farewell. "It
is you who must play the game."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">SO Commodore Jasen sat down at the board and a
very perplexing affair he found it. He invited Mr. Jos&eacute; de
Santador, Mr. Rodriguez de Santador and Miss Juanita, their
sister, to dinner, but at their earnest protest he yielded the
point and allowed himself to become their guest. Jos&eacute;
proved that he knew how to order food and wine, and the whole
trio displayed the decorum and excellent manners of well-bred
people. Juanita, who had, it appeared, been educated at a world-
famous English boarding school, attracted a great deal of notice,
not only on account of her beauty but because of the perfection
of her clothes and the splendour of her jewels. All through the
service of the meal she was gay, and with her guest&mdash;to whom
she devoted herself&mdash;discreetly flirtatious. The latter
noticed, however, that the conversation very seldom concerned the
intimate life of his hosts or their recent doings. Only once
Jos&eacute; volunteered information of any practical interest
concerning themselves. He informed their guest that, having
little confidence in the immediate future of their country, they
had realised their property, so far as possible, and were
proposing to settle down in Europe. Their present predilections
leaned towards the Riviera. Juanita alone had elected for
England.</p>

<p>"And why England?" Commodore Jasen enquired.</p>

<p>She leant towards him and lowered her tone.</p>

<p>"Because there are no casinos there," she whispered.</p>

<p>"You are not fond of gambling then?"</p>

<p>She shook her head wearily.</p>

<p>"I hate it. It is my brothers for whom I fear. At home, even
when the opportunity has come, I have never seen them play. Here
it is like madness. We are rich&mdash;but I am afraid. You will
talk to them perhaps? You almost live out here and you must know
how hopeless a business it is. Will you do that for me, my kind
friend?"</p>

<p>"Do you think that I know them well enough?" he asked, a
trifle dubiously.</p>

<p>"But we are not going away. You will see much of us, I hope.
We shall become, shall we not, great friends?"</p>

<p>He sighed.</p>

<p>"I hope so," he acknowledged. "But I wonder whether it would
be wise. I am very susceptible&mdash;for an elderly
person&mdash;Miss Juanita."</p>

<p>She openly patted his hand. He was conscious of the furtive
touch of her knee under the table. The message conveyed to him by
her eyes the most modest of men could not have misconstrued.</p>

<p>"<i>Tant mieux</i>," she murmured. "I hope that you are as
susceptible as I would wish you to be...."</p>

<p>Yet she had her restraints. He took her from the Casino, where
she pronounced herself bored and unhappy, to a supper restaurant
where one danced, and her single caress vouchsafed on the way was
more tender than alluring. Her whispered speech too, after they
had taken their places and before they began to dance,
was&mdash;considering its recipient&mdash;almost pathetic.</p>

<p>"I am glad you live here. I hope that you will go on being
kind to me. You are so human."</p>

<p>The saxophone, or some other instrument of devilish import,
wandered off in search of a new discord, and the result might
have been the chuckle which nearly escaped Commodore Jasen's
lips.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">IT was one o'clock before the Santador brothers
arrived. They brought with them a young compatriot, an
acquaintance, with whom Juanita danced tangoes without pausing,
until Jos&eacute; recalled her to the table. He whispered in her
ear and she shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Commodore Jasen does not dance the tango," she said, with a
note of anger in her tone.</p>

<p>"This is a waltz," her brother reminded her coldly. "It was
our new friend who brought you here. You should stay with
him."</p>

<p>She dismissed her partner and resumed her intimate
conversation with the Commodore.</p>

<p>"The tango is like madness to us," she whispered. "I dance it
even with professionals and forget. As for the young
man&mdash;Jos&eacute;'s friend&mdash;I would not cross the road
to pick up his heart, yet you could ask me nothing that I could
refuse. My friend&mdash;you are my friend?"</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>"I become desperate. This place is a hell. Again they have
lost. And I&mdash;I who do not even amuse myself&mdash;it is my
money too which disappears. Soon they will tell me, I suppose,
that I must be a typist, or a danseuse, or walk the streets, for
the money they have squandered."</p>

<p>"They seem to have the worst of luck," Jasen reflected. "But
why have you not your own money under your own control?"</p>

<p>"Over here we were going to make a trust, if that is what you
call it," she explained. "We were going to realise everything we
have and divide it into three portions. An <i>avocat</i> was to
arrive from Paris. When he comes there will be nothing left."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen murmured a few puzzled words of sympathy and
presently called for the bill. Juanita insisted on driving in his
car to the hotel. When they arrived there and she slipped out of
his arms, he wished them all good night.</p>

<p>"But you stay here?" Jos&eacute; exclaimed, in much
surprise.</p>

<p>"You don't leave us!" Juanita cried, seizing his arm.</p>

<p>The Commodore explained that he lived at Antibes and was only
over for the evening. The disappointment upon their faces was
flattering but, to a man of Jasen's somewhat suspicious nature, a
little suggestive.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he proposed, "I could induce you all to come over
to-morrow and spend the week-end with me. I have rather a famous
country place on the shore. If you care about bathing and that
sort of thing, I can give you as much as you want all day."</p>

<p>Juanita's thanks were expressed in a very torrent of
gratitude. The two young men were polite, but they glanced across
at the Casino and hesitated&mdash;a fact which puzzled their
would-be host very much.</p>

<p>"It is very kind," Jos&eacute; said doubtfully. "The trouble
with us is that we feel that there is a great deal of our money
over there waiting to come back to us."</p>

<p>Juanita was furious. She stamped her shapely foot upon the
pavement.</p>

<p>"Very well," she cried. "I accept Commodore Jasen's
invitation. I shall go in any case. You, my brothers, can please
yourselves. I only beg that you leave me a little of my own
money."</p>

<p>Jos&eacute; pulled himself together. He rebuked Juanita
sternly and turned to their proposed host.</p>

<p>"Do not take my sister too seriously, I beg of you," he said.
"Naturally, if she wishes to go, we accompany her. We accept your
invitation with pleasure, sir."</p>

<p>Juanita bade him a rapturous good night, and Commodore Jasen,
although he was a very inhuman man, was conscious of a not
unpleasant tingling of the senses as he stepped back into his
automobile. The sensation lasted, however, only for a matter of
seconds. Even before his chauffeur had had time to press the
starting button, he found himself intrigued by a somewhat
singular coincidence. Lavalon, the French detective, was leaning
out of the bar window, apparently watching the people coming out
from the Casino, but obviously listening to every word which had
passed between Commodore Jasen and his new friends.</p>

<p>The car glided off, swung presently to the right and climbed
with effortless ease into the Middle Corniche. Its occupant lit a
cigar and, leaning back amongst the cushions, set himself to
study the problem presented by the extreme friendliness of the
Argentines, the presence in Monte Carlo of the two famous
detectives, and Caroline Loyd's warning. He asked
himself&mdash;</p>

<p>First&mdash;were his Argentine friends swindlers and Juanita
an adventuress, and he their hoped-for prey, or were they merely
just what they seemed to be&mdash;a trio of rich young
people&mdash;the two brothers inveterate gamblers, and anxious to
keep friendly with him, in the hope that with Juanita's influence
they might, if necessary, have some one to borrow money from?</p>

<p>Secondly&mdash;were Lavalon and Brant here on <i>their</i>
account or his? Though the presence of the American meant the
latter probably, and, although he was full of confidence, he by
no means minimised the danger.</p>

<p>Thirdly&mdash;was it possible that the Argentines were,
consciously or unconsciously, being made use of by the detectives
to induce him to make a <i>faux pas</i> which would bring him
under their jurisdiction? There were subtleties in this theory
which Jasen was well able to appreciate.</p>

<p>He went over every little incident of the evening, with almost
meticulous care. There were arguments in favour of each
proposition. In the end he reached Antibes with his problem
unsolved.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">VERY much to their host's surprise, his guests
arrived on the following morning at exactly the agreed-upon hour,
namely midday. Juanita was already prepared for bathing.
Rodriguez changed and joined them down on the portion of shore
which belonged to the Ch&acirc;teau, but Jos&eacute;, who was
clumsier of build and stouter than his brother, preferred to
cruise round in the motor boat. To all appearance the three of
them enjoyed a simple and wholesome day&mdash;mostly spent in the
water. Afterwards they motored round to Cagnes and Juan, where
crowds of people of all nationalities were gathered, and
Commodore Jasen bespoke his favourite table on the terrace for
dinner that night. Throughout the whole of the day not a single
word was spoken, or incident occurred, which was in any way
suspicious. It was not until they sat down to dinner at Juan, and
Commodore Jasen discovered Lavalon and Brant at the next table
but one, that he felt any qualm of uneasiness. Not that he
flinched for a single moment. His blue eyes travelled over the
two men with the usual gleam of benevolent interest, which he
apparently displayed in all his fellow creatures. In his heart he
was not afraid. Others might make mistakes and leave loose ends
for clever men to pull, but not he. He considered now the
possibility, almost the probability, that they were in these
parts on his account. He felt not the slightest disquietude. Let
them suspect what they liked. He was a murderer? Yes. A great
robber? Certainly. But what living man could raise his voice and
testify against him? Not one. There never would be one. That was
the advantage of being a killer. He tested Juanita suddenly.</p>

<p>"Is not that Lavalon, the great French detective, sitting over
there?" he asked.</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed, but it was with genuine interest. She leant
towards him.</p>

<p>"Where? Do show me. I have never seen a real detective."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen pointed out the man with discretion. Juanita
passed the information to her brothers, who accepted it with
curiosity, but certainly no signs of fore-knowledge or fear. The
<i>rencontre</i> at least gave him an opportunity of moving one
of his pieces upon the board. It seemed impossible that there was
any connection between his guests and the two detectives. The
move, which he duly established in his mind, left him more
puzzled than ever.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">JUAN was at its best that night. There was no
gala and the music was mercifully subdued. A few yards behind
them the sea came falling upon the sand with a soft swirl of
toneless melody, a mysterious element in the darkness which the
gaily illuminated restaurant failed to pierce, until the moon
slid up from behind the Esterels and left a glittering pathway
across the bay.</p>

<p>"There is no other place in which to live," Juanita sighed.
"Oh, my dear host, you are so clever! Find me a potion to cure
these brothers of mine of gambling, and another," she added in a
lower tone, with all the sweetness of her eyes seeking for his,
"to make you feel something of what you say, to turn you from a
courtier into a lover."</p>

<p>He smiled at her tolerantly.</p>

<p>"Are you trying to turn the head of a respectable elderly
gentleman?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I do not feel that you are elderly," she assured him, "and I
would not wish to feel that you were respectable."</p>

<p>Jos&eacute;, who had been whispering with his brother, leaned
across the table and intervened a little abruptly.</p>

<p>"One needs an introduction to play in the Casino here?" he
enquired.</p>

<p>His host looked at him in mock severity.</p>

<p>"I thought you were coming out to me for a rest from that sort
of thing."</p>

<p>"So we are," the young man agreed. "But one must have a look
at the Casino."</p>

<p>"And I made them promise that they would bring no money with
them," Juanita observed ruefully.</p>

<p>"I suppose they will cash a cheque here," Jos&eacute;
ventured. "I kept my promise, anyway. I only brought a few
thousand francs."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen was not encouraging.</p>

<p>"They are not very accommodating with strangers," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"But we are your guests," the younger brother protested. "That
will surely be sufficient."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen gave no sign, but inwardly he was filled with
a vast contempt. This was the opportunity for which he had been
waiting. Very soon he would be able to move another piece across
the board. Meanwhile he shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>"You forget," he pointed out, "that, although I am delighted
to consider you all&mdash;especially your charming
sister&mdash;my <i>dear</i> friends, as a matter of fact, from
the point of view of any third person, we are nothing but casual
acquaintances. There is, I should explain, an etiquette in these
matters on the Riviera. I cannot vouch for you anywhere until I
know something of your means."</p>

<p>Jos&eacute; patted his stomach and inclined his head
gravely.</p>

<p>"We are rich," he confided.</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen coughed&mdash;a perfectly polite but
significant gesture.</p>

<p>"One requires for these Casinos proof," he challenged.</p>

<p>"Of course," Juanita murmured. "Why not tell the Commodore
everything? He is our friend," she went on, holding his hand,
"whether he wants to be or not."</p>

<p>"I agree," Rodriguez echoed.</p>

<p>Jos&eacute; shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Very good," he assented. "Commodore, you appear to be a
person of influence here&mdash;can you arrange for a few minutes
the entr&eacute;e to a private room?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," his host assented. "As soon as we have finished
dinner, I will take you to the directors' salon. Not that we are
likely to be overheard here," he added, glancing around.</p>

<p>"A private room would be better," Jos&eacute; insisted.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">COMMODORE JASEN had the shock of his life about
an hour later when, with the door of the directors' room locked
behind them, Jos&eacute; divested himself of his coat and
waistcoat. Not only was the young man wearing the most ingenious
and wonderful belt it was possible to conceive, but every slot
contained a Brazilian diamond of the purest and most marvellous
quality. One after another he produced them, until the table held
a little pyramid of flaming stones. Jasen stopped him at
last.</p>

<p>"It is sufficient," he begged earnestly. "Tell me first of
all&mdash;where did you have that belt made?"</p>

<p>"It was my father's design," the young man confided. "He was
the largest diamond merchant in South America. You see, the
fastening is secured with a catch. The belt is undone and opened
in a moment, but no one can undo it without knowing the
secret."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen examined the catch and marvelled. He felt the
remainder of the slots. They were still packed with diamonds.
Jos&eacute; thrust his hand into the pocket of his coat and
produced a letter of credit. The original amount indicated was
fifty thousand pounds sterling, and twenty-two thousand only had
been drawn.</p>

<p>"You can vouch for us financially now?" he asked, smiling.
"The diamonds are undervalued at a million pounds, and twenty-
eight thousand remain upon the letter of credit."</p>

<p>"With the greatest pleasure," his host assented. "Come with me
to the cashier."</p>

<p>On the way there, they passed Lavalon and his companion, and
Commodore Jasen smiled.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">A QUARTER of an hour to the Ch&acirc;teau, ten
minutes with Jake, a quarter of an hour back again. Even then
Juanita was in despair. She was wandering dejectedly up and down
in the gambling rooms, when at last Commodore Jasen found
her.</p>

<p>"The heavens be praised!" he exclaimed, as he linked his arm
in hers.</p>

<p>"But where have you been?" she cried, half inclined to be
petulant. "I have searched the Casino for you in vain and here I
find that the men are terrible. Very soon I should have permitted
myself to have been what you call 'picked up' in self-
preservation."</p>

<p>Jasen made satisfactory explanations. He had been told she was
dancing: been told that she was at the <i>Boule</i> tables:
everywhere he had pursued a false scent: and now&mdash;there was
a little dancing garden opposite, with good music and the light
ripple of wind in the trees! So they went there and danced, and
Juanita was happy because she loved to sip iced drinks from tall
tumblers, and dance. After all, she was young, and one well-
mannered man was as good as another. And how could she tell that
the particular man who was whispering affectionate things into
her ear was thinking a great deal more about a belt of diamonds
than of her? At three o'clock they visited the Casino. Neither
Jos&eacute; nor Rodriguez was willing to move. They had lost, as
usual, it is true, but a young Englishman had elected to take a
bank at baccarat, and they fancied their chances against him.
They would follow on presently, which was exactly according to
plan.</p>

<p>So Commodore Jasen and Juanita went home alone and sat on the
broad terrace, drinking cold squashes, and flirting with more or
less discretion, until the sky over Antibes was flecked with
pink, till a strange automobile rolled up and two ghastly figures
arrived to tell a terrible story of highway robbery, compared
with which all their losses at baccarat and <i>chemin de fer</i>
were as a snap of the fingers.</p>

<p>"A million pounds!" Jos&eacute; sobbed. "The fortune of all of
us. Commodore, you can vouch for it. You have seen the diamonds.
Where is the telephone? How does one arrive at the police?"</p>

<p>Their host calmed them down. The theft was absurd. No one
could get away with such a quantity of diamonds. At night the
telephone was disconnected. They must rest for an hour or two,
and when the morning was properly advanced, the police would be
sent for. Still dazed with the chloroform to which they had been
subjected, they were easily induced to collapse into a coma-like
state of slumber. The Commodore himself took them to their rooms.
Afterwards he descended in search of Juanita.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE inmates of the Ch&acirc;teau d'Antibes were
not the only people in the neighbourhood who had spent the night
without rest. It was nearly seven o'clock when the famous French
detective and his friend, Brant, descended from a closed car at
the Proven&ccedil;al H&ocirc;tel and mounted a little wearily to
their rooms.</p>

<p>"Two hours I think we may give ourselves," Lavalon
suggested.</p>

<p>"One hour," the American insisted.</p>

<p>"I have twenty-five men posted round the Ch&acirc;teau,"
Lavalon reminded his colleague.</p>

<p>Brant's face, grey with fatigue, was set like granite.</p>

<p>"You don't quite realise what this is to me, Lavalon," he said
earnestly. "For seven years they have had it against us at Police
Headquarters that we have never once come into actual touch with
the head of the Lebworthy Gang. I have built up a case against
Jasen of the Ch&acirc;teau there by suppositions, by guesses, by
luck. Gradually it has become cemented into a whole. If we once
get our hands on him, get him back to New York, get him arrested
on one definite charge, the rest will be easy. I cannot run any
risk. There are others of them in hiding there. I am sure of
that. I grudge taking my own eyes off the Ch&acirc;teau for a
moment. I shall take a bath and a cup of strong coffee and get
over there."</p>

<p>"Just as you like," Lavalon agreed. "I will be with you. I am
not a man to shirk in a business like this."</p>

<p>The two men departed to their rooms. In an hour's time, Brant
was slipping the cartridges into his automatic as they drove back
again along the road to Antibes.</p>

<p>"There will be just one weak point in our evidence," Lavalon
remarked, "and that will be to associate Jasen directly with the
robbery."</p>

<p>Brant laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>"Dear colleague," he said, "listen. I find you down here with
instructions to enquire into the past of these Argentines. You
find everything about them satisfactory and that they are justly
in possession of a large quantity of diamonds. Very good. We
meet. We speak of this and then&mdash;the man whom I have been
trailing&mdash;Jasen&mdash;makes friends with them. He invites
them to his Ch&acirc;teau. Why?"</p>

<p>"There is that very attractive young woman," the Frenchman
reflected.</p>

<p>Brant scoffed.</p>

<p>"Sam Lebworthy never looked at a woman unless she could help
him," he said. "Anyhow, here they are together. Jos&eacute; de
Santador and Jasen go off to a private room at Juan. What for? I
know. Jos&eacute; shows him the diamonds. For Jasen goes straight
from that room, and instructs the cashier to give these young
Argentines credit for a very large amount, on his guarantee if
necessary. That is proof that he had satisfied himself. It was
also a bluff. What does he do then? The Argentines go in to play.
Jasen slips out to his car and is driven furiously back to the
Ch&acirc;teau. He spends a short time there in earnest
conversation with his butler, who, I am convinced, was one of his
gang in America. Back he goes and takes care that the Santadors
make no movement towards leaving. He brings the girl home and
waits. Your own men saw the car containing the two Argentines
held up, saw the elder one thrown to the ground, and his belt
removed."</p>

<p>"It will be hard to explain," Lavalon murmured, "why they did
not intervene."</p>

<p>"It should not be," Brant replied. "The robbery was carried
out by myrmidons. It is the arch-criminal we want&mdash;the whole
world wants. We have him now. The diamonds will be found at the
Ch&acirc;teau, for there is no chance for any one to leave it.
Within a week I shall be on my way back to New York with the most
agreeable travelling companion I have ever had in my life."</p>

<p>"There is no joy in life," Lavalon said fervently, "for one in
our profession to compare with an exploit such as this."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">COMMODORE JASEN, with Juanita by his side, and
Jos&eacute; and Rodriguez opposite, was seated at the former's
writing table in his study, when Broadman threw open the door and
announced the two visitors of fate. By agreement, it was the
Frenchman who opened the proceedings.</p>

<p>"I believe that I am speaking to Commodore Jasen," he said,
addressing the latter.</p>

<p>"Quite so," was the unruffled reply.</p>

<p>"My name is Lavalon of the French police," the detective
continued. "I believe that you," he went on, bowing to them in
turn, "are Monsieur Jos&eacute; de Santador, Monsieur Rodriguez
de Santador, and Mademoiselle Juanita de Santador?"</p>

<p>They all assented. It seemed to Lavalon himself that there was
a slight lack of enthusiasm in their reception of him.</p>

<p>"I understand," he continued, "that you&mdash;Monsieur
Santador&mdash;have been robbed of a large quantity of diamonds
on the road between Juan and here last night?"</p>

<p>"Early this morning," Jos&eacute; corrected him. "Quite
true."</p>

<p>"The police here," Commodore Jasen intervened, leaning back,
"certainly merit our congratulations. The news has reached them
quickly."</p>

<p>"I should like," Lavalon observed, "to have a word with your
butler, Commodore Jasen, upon this matter."</p>

<p>The latter touched a bell which stood upon his desk.</p>

<p>"With pleasure," he assented.</p>

<p>In due course Broadman made his appearance. It was Lavalon who
interrogated him.</p>

<p>"Your name is Michael Broadman?"</p>

<p>The man seemed surprised.</p>

<p>"That is so," he admitted.</p>

<p>"What were you doing between five and six o'clock this
morning?" Lavalon asked.</p>

<p>"I was out on the road between here and Juan," the butler
replied coolly.</p>

<p>"What were you doing there?"</p>

<p>"I was carrying out a little commission for my master."</p>

<p>Brant swung round towards Jasen.</p>

<p>"You hear that?" he said. "You admit that your servant was
acting under your instructions?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," Commodore Jasen agreed. "My butler was scarcely
likely to be wandering about the road at that hour of the morning
without my instructions or permission."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know," Lavalon said, moving nearer to the door,
as though to cut off any possibility of Broadman's escape, whilst
at the same time Brant edged towards the Commodore&mdash;"I
suppose you know that a very serious robbery took place upon the
stretch of road you spoke of, at precisely that hour this
morning?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, I know, sir," the butler replied civilly. "I was
there. In fact, I was the thief."</p>

<p>"No, no, Broadman," the Commodore protested, "scarcely that,
my man. You were acting under my instructions."</p>

<p>Brant's eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"You admit that?" he demanded, leaning across the table
towards the Commodore.</p>

<p>"Of course I admit it," was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>Lavalon moved towards the open window and raised a whistle to
his lips. Commodore Jasen looked over his shoulder. Half a dozen
gendarmes were climbing the grassy bank which led on to the
terrace communicating with the rooms. Commodore Jasen frowned.
For the first time, his composure seemed threatened.</p>

<p>"Confound those fellows," he exclaimed. "They're breaking down
all my geraniums&mdash;and what are they doing here, anyway?"</p>

<p>"You will soon find out," Brant jeered.</p>

<p>"What is all this about?" Jos&eacute; de Santador asked. "I
have been robbed. That is quite true. But I have not invoked the
assistance of the police. I have not even telephoned to the
police station."</p>

<p>"I fancy," Commodore Jasen said calmly, "that these two
gentlemen belong more to the detective of fiction than of fact.
They do not wait for an appeal. They discover a crime before it
is committed. Would you be so kind, Monsieur Lavalon, as to
instruct your gendarmes there to wait upon the terrace? I do not
wish their muddy feet upon my Turkey carpet."</p>

<p>"A bluff like this is not going to help you, Lebworthy," Brant
said fiercely. "You're for it, and the sooner you realise that,
the better."</p>

<p>"Lebworthy does not happen to be my name," Commodore Jasen
objected, "nor have I any acquaintance with any one who has a
claim to it. You seem to have blundered in upon this little
affair on your own initiative. However, there are, no doubt,
excuses for you. Perhaps your minds will be more at rest if the
diamonds are produced. Juanita, would you mind? You will find
them in that drawer."</p>

<p>She patted the Commodore on the cheek, crossed the room, and
returned with the belt of diamonds. The two detectives stared at
it in blank amazement.</p>

<p>"These are the facts," Commodore Jasen went on, leaning back
in his chair, the tips of his fingers pressed together. "I met
these young people a short time ago and took some interest in
them. I believe&mdash;Jos&eacute; and Rodriguez&mdash;you will
not be offended if I say that I found you behaving not only
cruelly to your sister but most unwisely in your own
interests."</p>

<p>"It is the truth," Jos&eacute; admitted.</p>

<p>"Our two young friends were, in short," the Commodore confided
to the two men, "gambling in very large sums. They would soon
have come to the end of their letter of credit and begun upon the
diamonds. I must confess to feeling a great interest in Miss
Juanita here," he went on, caressing for a moment the hand which
was stealing round his neck, "and chiefly for her sake, I invited
them out here with the sole intention of teaching them a lesson.
Broadman robbed them of their diamonds on my instigation, and
after they had had a few hours' fright, I have induced them to
sign this paper, in consideration of which the diamonds are once
more in their possession. Let me read you this paper."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen adjusted his seldom used monocle, and read
out.</p><br>

<p class="letter">I, JOS&Eacute; DE SANTADOR, and I, RODRIGUEZ DE
SANTADOR, hereby pledge my word of honour to Commodore Jasen that
I will not enter a casino or engage in any game of chance until
the diamonds which are the joint property of ourselves and our
sister are realised and the amount distributed between us in
three equal portions. And I further pledge my word that after
this has been done I will not at any time risk the loss of more
than a thousand pounds in any two months. In consideration of
these promises Commodore Jasen returns to us the diamonds in
question.</p>

<p class="letter">Signed,<br> Jos&eacute; de Santador<br>
Rodriguez de Santador.</p><br>

<p>Commodore Jasen laid down the document and, with Juanita's arm
still around his neck, looked reproachfully at his two
visitors.</p>

<p>"If you would kindly instruct your gendarmes to keep to the
path when they leave," he begged, "I should be glad. I do not
like my flowers broken down and I do not care to be addressed by
a name to which I have no claim. Otherwise, we are much obliged
by your visit, and I think my young friends here must appreciate
your watchfulness on their behalf."</p>

<p>Jos&eacute; was scarcely grateful.</p>

<p>"Quite unnecessary," he said curtly. "My brother and I are
perfectly well able to look after ourselves and our
possessions."</p>

<p>"And in any case," Juanita added, with a flash in her eyes, as
she looked across at the two detectives, "we would be perfectly
safe anywhere, with a friend like Commodore Jasen."</p>

SUICIDE CORNER</a></h2>

<h3>No record of magazine publication in this form found.<br>
Presumably apeared in <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i> in 1932.<br>
Reprinted in <i>The Saint Mystery Magazine</i>, Sep 1959</h3>

<p class="first">THE leader of the orchestra, who was a person of
much imagination, always declared that the descent upon the
Caf&eacute; de Paris, during the sacred dinner hour, of that
strange flight of phantom birds, was heralded by portents of an
unusual and dramatic nature. First of all, the wind, which, as
though exhausted after a week of mistral, had shaken neither leaf
nor bough of any tree from dawn till twilight, woke, and, as
though in a hurry, brought a scurry of leaves underneath the
tables of the caf&eacute; proper on to the dancing floor of the
restaurant, where they lay like dead things until swept away.
Afterwards, two of the roosting pigeons of the square, who might
well have been sentinels of their dozing fellows, flew suddenly
down from their shelter amongst the fa&ccedil;ades and spurious
ornamentation of the Casino front, and drifted solemnly over the
heads of the diners, uttering hoarse cries, as though they
scented danger. Waiters paused in their hurrying to and fro, and
stood with dishes in their hands, watching the curiously circling
birds. A wine waiter, who had been serving some priceless
Burgundy, went on pouring it until the wine was trickling in a
little stream across the table-cloth on to the floor. Suddenly
the pigeons disappeared, not with any effort of slow and graceful
flight, but apparently in a wild and panic-stricken swoop. There
was a disturbed murmur amongst the crowd of diners.</p>

<p>"Never in my life," the manager declared, as he stood with his
hands behind his back, gazing across the strip of garden, "have I
seen those pigeons stir after they have once been to roost, till
morning."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the incident&mdash;although unusual&mdash;would
speedily have been forgotten, except for what followed. Circling
around the square, without formation, in ones and twos, flying
wearily and giving the impression of immense fatigue, came a
flock of birds strange to Monte Carlo. They were, or seemed to be
at some distance, jet-black. They crossed the corner of the
grotesque building, spread out over the small tables where the
loungers of the place were taking their coffee, and finally
floated over the dancing floor of the space allotted to the
dinner tables of the outdoor restaurant. For a moment every one
was dazed. Then a woman shrieked, picked up her wrap and ran for
the indoor portion of the building. Meanwhile, the birds, with
incredible voracity, lit almost upon the dining tables, grubbed
everywhere about the floor, scavenging, tearing to pieces with
their yellow beaks everything that seemed like food. Two or three
more women followed the first one, and the whole place seemed on
the verge of a panic, when an old resident, who was being
entertained by a Princess of the neighbourhood, rose in his
place.</p>

<p>"The birds are harmless," he called out. "They are the hooded
crows of Corsica."</p>

<p>"Crows are not migratory birds," some one objected.</p>

<p>"Neither are these," was the prompt response. "They were
probably blown out to sea by the gale and landed upon a small
steamer. There was one entering the harbour as I came up the
hill."</p>

<p>The explanation satisfied the intelligence of every one. They
started feeding the birds, and their male kind went in search of
the deserting women. But it seemed as though intelligence was not
the only one of the sensibilities which needed assuaging. There
were perhaps sixty or seventy people dining in scattered groups
and, amongst the majority at least, there remained something, if
not of alarm, of superstitious depression. The birds strutted and
hopped here and there, differing very slightly from the ordinary
black crow of the fields, but carrying with them an atmosphere of
the unusual. It was as though they diffused everywhere a sense of
uneasiness, against which the mind was powerless to cope.</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen, who was dining alone with Zo&euml;, was one
of the few who regarded the incident with indifference. He patted
her hand when he became aware of her distress.</p>

<p>"My dear girl," he protested, "drink a glass of your wine. Our
friend over there has given us what, I am convinced, is the
correct explanation of the arrival of those birds."</p>

<p>A wild-looking young man at the next table was shouting to his
companions. He was half in jest and half in earnest, but there
were drops of unusual perspiration on his forehead.</p>

<p>"They came over Suicide Corner," he declared. "Look at the
face of that old one there. If you look long enough, you can see
it bent over the roulette tables. I'm off!"</p>

<p>He threw a note upon the table and rushed away without waiting
for his hat or coat. It is hard to tell what might have followed,
had the manager not saved the situation. He strode into the
middle of the dancing floor, with the saxophone player on one
side and the drummer on the other. Together the two musicians
bent to their task. With a curious rustling of the wings, as
though they rose lazily and unwillingly, the whole flock flew
away almost within reach of the hands of the crowd over whom they
passed. They made one circle and then flew steadily for the
harbour.</p>

<p>"Gone to book their return passage," one humourist
suggested.</p>

<p>"Thank God, they have gone!" Zo&euml; declared fervently.</p>

<p>And there were a good many others who felt the same
relief.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE evening, after a fashion, was
re&euml;stablished. From most tables a demand went out for more
wine. The orchestra started one of their most popular dance
tunes. Soon the floor was crowded. Commodore Jasen rose to his
feet.</p>

<p>"We will dance this," he said to his companion. "Afterwards I
shall be fatigued. I shall then send for our young friend and you
will open up the business upon which we came."</p>

<p>The girl indulged in a characteristic grimace.</p>

<p>"I will do my best," she said, "only I wish that this had not
happened. I am afraid."</p>

<p>"What is there in life to fear?" her companion asked, as they
passed into the throng.</p>

<p>"It is not life of which I was thinking," she answered.</p>

<p>The orchestra played with furious spirit. Never had they
worked so hard. They had almost the air of revivalist musicians,
as they sank exhausted over their instruments when the end came,
and for a time they were indifferent to the vigorous clapping of
hands. Commodore Jasen led his partner to her seat. He fanned
himself with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"A trifle too vigorous for me," he observed, as he recovered
his breath. "Ah, I see one of the young professionals over there
is free."</p>

<p>He beckoned to a pale-faced young man who was seated in a
distant corner alone, and who, only a few minutes previously, had
been one of the most alarmed of the spectators. Perhaps he had
not yet fully recovered from the nervous shock, for he rose
almost unwillingly to his feet and crossed the room towards his
prospective clients. He bowed to Zo&euml; and to the Commodore as
to strangers and they accepted his greeting in like fashion.</p>

<p>"My niece would like to dance," the Commodore told him. "I am
myself a little fatigued."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; surrendered herself to the young man's automatic
gesture. Commodore Jasen lit a cigar and, leaning back in his
chair, watched the dancing with benevolent interest. The encore
was not a long one, and on its conclusion the dancer brought his
companion back to the table. Commodore Jasen fingered his
pocketbook tentatively.</p>

<p>"You will be able to dance again with my niece, I hope," he
demanded.</p>

<p>The young man hesitated.</p>

<p>"I am really engaged for the evening," he explained nervously,
"to the lady who has been my patroness for the season. I ventured
to dance with Mademoiselle, as she has scarcely commenced her
dinner. She is with Princess Ostreville."</p>

<p>"I see," the Commodore murmured. "Nevertheless, I think if you
make an effort&mdash;say in half an hour&mdash;your patroness
will spare you for a few minutes&mdash;just a few minutes for one
more dance," he went on, "and perhaps a glass of wine."</p>

<p>His cold blue eyes were fixed, indifferently enough to all
appearance, upon the young man's. The latter had the air of one
receiving sentence of death.</p>

<p>"I will explain to Madame," he said. "In half an
hour&mdash;yes&mdash;I will return."</p>

<p>He bowed and hurried away. Commodore Jasen watched him
thoughtfully. There was something furtive about the young man's
progress. He seemed in a great hurry to return unmolested to his
solitary table in his solitary corner.</p>

<p>"I sometimes ask myself," Commodore Jasen observed, almost
under his breath, "why Michael was ever accepted, even in our
lowest class. In New York he seemed to have plenty of nerve,
though. Late hours, I suppose: lack of real employment and this
puppy-dog life have had their effect."</p>

<p>"What do you call lack of real employment for a professional
dancer?" the girl asked him. "There is no one on the Riviera in
more demand than Michael. They say that this Mrs. Hammond has had
to pay high indeed for the right to control his movements."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen stroked his moustache.</p>

<p>"When I said 'lack of work,'" he explained indulgently, "I
meant <i>work</i>. Nothing to do, that, you know, with the
avocation of a professional dancer. By real work I mean something
entirely different."</p>

<p>"Has Michael ever done any 'real work' for you?" she enquired.
"He does not seem to me to have the courage."</p>

<p>"He performed one mission in New York quite successfully," her
companion told her. "He also carried out some very easy enquiry
work here with success. At present, I admit, he seems an
inefficient sort of person. Different kinds of enterprises,
however, demand different qualities."</p>

<p>The girl toyed with a peach for several moments. She had the
air of one very far from being at her ease.</p>

<p>"There is something you still wish to say to me?" the
Commodore continued presently.</p>

<p>"If I might dare," she admitted. "You are dissatisfied with
Michael, I know. So far he has failed in his project, and, as you
often tell us, you have no place for failures. Even bearing that
in mind, I think I would not press him too hard to-night."</p>

<p>"And why not?" was the smoothly asked question.</p>

<p>"Because," the girl confided, "ridiculous as it may seem to
you, that poor young man is in a terrible state of nerves. I
suppose it was seeing us here, and guessing that you have come to
talk to him, and then&mdash;those birds...."</p>

<p>"Ah," Commodore Jasen murmured. "Those birds!"</p>

<p>"I know that things like that mean nothing to you," she went
on, "but I expect that he lives an altogether unhealthy life. I
could feel his body tremble when he was dancing and, although he
seemed all out of condition, his hands were as cold as ice. You
can force a man into anything, of course, but I am not sure that
anything he attempted to-night would be well done."</p>

<p>The Commodore looked at his companion speculatively.</p>

<p>"You have common sense," he approved. "You speak well enough
from your point of view. The trouble is that you do not know
mine. He does, and he knows that when he fails he disappears.
Wonderful steadying effect that has upon any sort of a creature
with a spark of life still there! I ask myself why sometimes,"
Jasen went on with the air of one considering an abstruse
point&mdash;"I ask myself why the ordinary human being clings so
tenaciously to life. I have never found a satisfactory answer to
the question and I daresay I never shall. But I think that to
save his life, even that young man might get the better of a fit
of nerves. You will take some coffee?"</p>

<p>"I will take some coffee," the girl agreed.</p>

<p>Presently Michael received a gracious signal from his
patroness, and a few minutes later he was escorting on to the
dancing floor a rather fat, elderly woman with a mass of too fair
hair, a wickedly disported Chanel frock and a gorgeous diamond
necklace. Zo&euml; watched her curiously.</p>

<p>"I wonder you don't make him go for the necklace," she
observed.</p>

<p>"Too obvious, my dear," her companion sighed. "The loss of
such a necklace would make even a woman like Mrs. Hammond
vituperative. Besides, who else but a gigolo could steal
jewellery from a woman like that? They would put him in prison
before they began to look for it, and Michael in prison, with
four walls safely around him, would be rather a dangerous
proposition."</p>

<p>"He may very well find his way into prison on the present
scheme," the girl reflected.</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen smiled.</p>

<p>"Not if I know anything of Mrs. Hammond," he said.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">IN about half-an-hour's time Mrs. Hammond,
flushed and happy with dancing, and delighted with her dinner
party, was in the humour to grant almost any request her cavalier
could make to her. She listened to what he had to say as he held
her chair, glanced across at the Commodore and Zo&euml;, and
nodded her consent. The young dancer returned to his table, where
he helped himself liberally to the contents of a bottle in front
of him, and when the music for the next dance commenced, he
crossed the floor towards the table where Zo&euml; and her escort
were sitting.</p>

<p>"Not too long a dance," the Commodore enjoined, as they
prepared to leave him. "Let us have time for a little
conversation."</p>

<p>The young man shivered slightly and, as many other people had
done that evening, he glanced towards the particular corner over
the caf&eacute; from which those birds had first made their
appearance.</p>

<p>"We will dance the first part only," he promised.</p>

<p>"Dance the second part," Jasen suddenly proposed. "I have
friends here with whom I might talk later. Sit down.
<i>Ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, another glass. Good. Now make
your report."</p>

<p>The dreaded moment had come. Michael had not the least desire
to drink, but he swallowed a glass of the wine which had been
poured out.</p>

<p>"Everything has been done," he announced at last. "I have
followed instructions carefully. But, Commodore," he went on,
leaning over the table, "I do not think&mdash;I honestly do not
think that the scheme will work."</p>

<p>"And just why not?" was the cold demand.</p>

<p>"You do not understand Mrs. Hammond, sir," the young man
continued eagerly. "I know she is fond of me up to a certain
point. She would have been fond of any young man who danced with
her and flattered her and played the r&ocirc;le I have had to
fill. But she has not a great deal of heart, really, and it is
not a personal affection. It is just the getting what she wants.
When it comes to my disgrace, or parting with a large sum of
money, she will only laugh. She loves her money, sir."</p>

<p>"I have ascertained," the Commodore observed, "that she is
worth a million pounds&mdash;that is fifty thousand a year. She
may love her money, Michael, but she loves you a little, too.
Yes?"</p>

<p>The world who saw that smile upon Jasen's lips might have
thought it a pleasant gesture, but Zo&euml; and the young man
seated within a few feet of him knew better.</p>

<p>"Because she is rich," the latter went on, "it does not follow
that she is not sometimes terribly mean. If we take a taxi, she
won't let me give the man a reasonable tip. The servants at the
hotel hate her. She gives nothing to the croupiers, however much
she wins. Sometimes I am ashamed to pay the bills at the
restaurants and I slip something of my own in with the
change."</p>

<p>"What an unpleasant old lady!" the Commodore sighed. "However,
it all fits in with my idea of her psychology. You often find a
person who is mean in small things is a spendthrift in large
ones. We are not trying her too high. We shall ask for only half
a million. You should be worth that to her, Michael. You young
men, unless you have some one of intelligence behind you, never
know how to make use of your opportunities."</p>

<p>There was something hopeless about Commodore Jasen's
tone&mdash;a note half of irony and yet with a background of
unshakable determination. Michael recognised it, as many others
in life had done before him.</p>

<p>"I think you are wrong, sir," he said, "but you are the
master."</p>

<p>"The mistakes I have made in life," Jasen said, "have been
very few. In this case, you need have no fear. I have watched
Mrs. Hammond. She is a foolish woman. She may need skilful
handling, but I have the skill. I think I may say without
boasting," he wound up, his voice seeming to wander out in little
silver threads from his partially closed mouth, "that I have
never failed to kill my man when killing has been necessary, and
I have never failed to receive all that I asked in any case of
barter."</p>

<p>The young man rose to his feet. He fingered his tie nervously
and afterwards held out his arms. Zo&euml; and he floated away
amongst the throng. Commodore Jasen watched the lady whom they
had been discussing.</p>

<p>"A common enough type out here," he reflected. "Wealthy,
without social gifts or position&mdash;an easy prey for any
adventurer."</p>

<p>He caught a glimpse of her sideways, as she leaned over to
speak to her hostess, and for the first time he realised the one
strong feature of her face&mdash;her jaw. Michael probably earned
his money, he decided. For the young man's sake he rather
regretted that jaw.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; and her partner returned at the end of the encore.
The latter accepted a glass of wine and sat with his back to the
dancing floor. Very reluctantly he drew from his pocket two
folded slips of paper and passed them across the table. Commodore
Jasen studied them carefully and transferred them with dexterous
fingers to his waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>"Ridiculously easy," he murmured. "Your distressed appearance,
my young friend," he went on, glancing at him keenly, "is perhaps
so much to the good. Keep it up, but don't overdo it."</p>

<p>"When are you going to see Mrs. Hammond?" Michael asked
fearfully.</p>

<p>"To-morrow evening."</p>

<p>"I am supposed to be dining here with her&mdash;a quiet
dinner," Michael volunteered. "I don't suppose she will come. I
am more likely to receive a visit from the gendarmes."</p>

<p>Jasen smiled scornfully.</p>

<p>"There will be no gendarmes," he assured the dancer. "She may
be angry, but you will probably know how to console her. An extra
glass or two of champagne, your vows for the future, a little
more <i>empressement</i> during the dance! There is nothing, I am
sure, which I can teach you."</p>

<p>"You taught me something in New York I wish I had never
learnt," was the bitter rejoinder. "You taught me to be
dishonest."</p>

<p>The Commodore shook his head.</p>

<p>"My dear young man," he said, "you needed no lessons. Your
environment here, your profession&mdash;well, they would neither
of them entitle you to membership of the Y.M.C.A., would they?
Now, try and throw away that woebegone air for a time. Remember
that you have a hundred thousand francs coming to you. My men do
not work for nothing, as you know."</p>

<p>Michael rose to his feet. Curiously enough, he, like so many
others that evening, glanced for the second or third time towards
that corner of the caf&eacute; round which the flight of birds
had circled.</p>

<p>"Still superstitious?" Jasen asked with faint sarcasm.</p>

<p>The young man shivered.</p>

<p>"I am not the only one who was scared to-night," he answered,
as, with a bow to Zo&euml;, he took his leave.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hammond received her visitor on the following evening
affably and even with enthusiasm. She cut short his opening
words.</p>

<p>"I know all about you, Commodore," she said. "You have that
beautiful ch&acirc;teau at Antibes which belongs to Lord
Somebody-or-other. I have seen you out there, bathing. I have
seen you here too, often," she added, with a slight smile. "Once
with that beautiful girl from the Cap, who was at the Opera the
other night with the Marquis de St. V&eacute;ran, and last
night&mdash;with a very pretty little lady last night!"</p>

<p>The Commodore smiled.</p>

<p>"When one gets on in years as I, alas, have done," he
confided, "one feels that one must take hold of one's
opportunities. You are a widow, I believe, Mrs. Hammond. When you
have reached my years of&mdash;indiscretion, I suppose you would
say&mdash;you will realise that."</p>

<p>"No one would ever accuse you of not making the best of
things," she declared. "Do make yourself comfortable in that
easy-chair. The Princess was talking to me a great deal about you
last night. She complains that you do not go to her parties as
often as you used to. What about ringing for a waiter? It is
almost cocktail time, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"You are very kind," the Commodore replied, "but I think not,
if you will excuse me just at present. The fact of it is, Mrs.
Hammond," he went on, "I am charmed with this opportunity of
making your acquaintance, but I ought to tell you at once that my
visit to you is not altogether on a pleasant subject."</p>

<p>"Hoity-toity!" the lady exclaimed. "What's all this about?
What unpleasant subject can there be for us to discuss?"</p>

<p>"At any rate," her caller remarked, with a smile, "if the
subject does turn out to be unpleasant&mdash;perhaps it
won't&mdash;I may be completely mistaken&mdash;we will at least
contrive to discuss it amiably."</p>

<p>"My dear man," the lady begged, "don't talk in riddles any
longer for the sake of being polite. I know who you are. I am
very pleased to see you here and to add you to my list of
acquaintances. I shall listen to everything you have to say with
the utmost respect, because every one has such a high opinion of
you. Let's get it over&mdash;the unpleasant part at any
rate."</p>

<p>"The unpleasant part," Commodore Jasen admitted, "is connected
with a young man who goes by the name of Michael, I believe. His
name is really Michael Brennan. Mikkie he used to be called."</p>

<p>"Michael, my dancer at the Caf&eacute; de Paris!" Mrs. Hammond
exclaimed. "The young man who was dancing with me last night and
whom I saw at your table?"</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"What on earth can you have to say disagreeable about him?"
she asked, with slightly heightened colour.</p>

<p>"About him personally&mdash;nothing," the Commodore replied.
"I have known him for some years. I knew him in New York. He has
always struck me as being a very well-behaved and well-brought-up
young man. I have taken, in fact, quite an interest in him. I
daresay though, even you&mdash;although a woman very seldom hears
of these things&mdash;have an idea that he has been rather
foolish lately?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you are talking about," the lady rejoined.
"I thought he seemed very queer last night, but he has Irish
blood in him and those beastly birds had got on his nerves. Irish
people are always superstitious, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"He was certainly upset," the Commodore agreed, "but I do not
think it was altogether the birds. I understand that you and he
have been quite friends, Mrs. Hammond. Why not? A very well-
brought-up and well-behaved young man. Still, I should have
thought that, seeing so much of him, you would have gathered that
he has been in trouble lately."</p>

<p>"I know that he has been hard up," Mrs. Hammond admitted. "He
told me so. He has had to sell his little car. I don't mind
telling you, Commodore&mdash;you are a man of the world and a
good sort&mdash;I gave him a cheque for fifty thousand francs to
buy a new one.</p>

<p>"It is a good deal to give a dancer, I know," Mrs. Hammond
went on. "But I believe in paying for the things you get in life.
A woman in my position cannot go traipsing about into restaurants
and dancing places by herself. I just send for Michael and go
where I please and when I please. I have been thinking often that
I really don't pay him enough. I ought to give him a salary. If I
took a stuck-up young woman companion, who would not be a bit of
use to me, I would probably have to give her four or five hundred
a year, and that young man&mdash;who is jolly useful&mdash;I pay
generously, of course, but it is practically only his dancing
fees he gets from me."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you talk like this, Mrs. Hammond," her
visitor said. "It shows me that I have to do with a sensible
woman. I am afraid that what I have to say, however, will be a
shock to you."</p>

<p>"Well, get on with it and don't talk so much, then," she said
irritably. "Oh, I know you are trying to be very polite and nice
and all that, but you are getting me worked up. If Michael's done
anything wrong, I want to hear what it is."</p>

<p>"I am very much afraid," the Commodore told her, "that Michael
has forged your name to a cheque for a much larger amount than
fifty thousand francs."</p>

<p>"God bless my soul!" she gasped. "You don't mean that?"</p>

<p>"I do indeed," was the grave assent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hammond, who had been lounging skittishly on the end of
the sofa with a cigarette in her mouth, collapsed on to a chair
and threw the cigarette into an ash tray. Some of her high colour
had faded.</p>

<p>"Forged my name!" she repeated. "Michael! I cannot believe it.
How do you come to be concerned in this, Commodore?"</p>

<p>"In this way," the latter explained. "As I told you, I knew
the lad in New York, and I see him here every now and then. I am
not like a great many people with a prejudice against
professional dancers. I have always looked upon him as a decent
young chap and I have had him over to swim and lunch and play a
few sets of tennis more than once."</p>

<p>"Very nice of you too," the lady murmured. "I think I know a
gentleman when I see one and I am not ashamed to take Michael
anywhere."</p>

<p>"Quite right of you," Jasen approved warmly. "Well, when he
was over about a week ago, he showed me this cheque of yours for
the car and asked me if I would kindly cash it."</p>

<p>"Why didn't he take it to the bank himself?" Mrs. Hammond
demanded.</p>

<p>"Simply because," the other explained, "he is a little
sensitive about money affairs, as you know. He banks at the same
bank and they know that he is a professional dancer. I do not
think he wanted to pay in a cheque from a client for that amount.
He asked me if I would put it through my Paris bank&mdash;which I
was very pleased to do."</p>

<p>"And you gave him the money?"</p>

<p>"And I gave him the money. But naturally that is not the
transaction I have come to see you about."</p>

<p>"There is another cheque, you say? Forged? Tell me about
that."</p>

<p>"You must prepare yourself for something of a shock," the
Commodore went on. "As I told you, I thought the young man looked
very depressed last night. This morning, before ten o'clock, he
was over at my place in a taxicab. He looked upon me as the
oldest friend he had and he made&mdash;up to a certain
point&mdash;a clean breast of it. He has been gambling, Mrs.
Hammond. Evenings when you have not been dancing or wanted him,
he has gone into Nice and stayed there, playing all night. He has
been playing up at Beausoleil here too, and the fact of the
matter is that he has lost a great deal of money. He has borrowed
from every friend he has. The amount he owes me has nothing to do
with the matter and I will not refer to it. I would have let it
stand over as long as he had wished, but he is also in the hands
of a lawyer money-lender in Nice, who threatens to sue him and
send him to prison unless he pays. The long and short of it is
that he brought me a cheque this morning&mdash;a cheque of
yours&mdash;for five hundred thousand francs, and asked me to
change it in the same way as I had done the other."</p>

<p>"A cheque of mine for five hundred thousand francs," the lady
repeated in a stunned tone.</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen opened his pocketbook and produced it. She
read it over, word by word, and gazed at her own signature as
though stupefied.</p>

<p>"Amazing," she muttered. "I should have sworn that was my
writing. I should never have believed that any one&mdash;much
less Michael&mdash;could have imitated it like that."</p>

<p>She unlocked a drawer in a cupboard and drew out a cheque
book. She looked back through the counterfoils.</p>

<p>"Yes," she admitted. "There was a loose cheque. I remember I
took it with me to Juan-les-Pins the other night, in case I was
short, and as I did not use it, I put it back in the cheque book.
Go on, please."</p>

<p>"I went to my bank at Juan," the Commodore continued, "and I
drew out five hundred thousand francs and gave them to Michael,
who was with me. I took him back to lunch at the Ch&acirc;teau
and I cross-questioned him closely about your cheque. I cannot
say I have ever had a single suspicion about the boy, but I did
not feel like paying that cheque in, and as I happened to have
plenty of money there, I didn't. As you see, I have kept it,
although I have given him the money for it. After lunch, we went
together to Nice, and I personally saw him pay off the amounts he
owed. Then I brought him on to Monte Carlo, although I did not
intend to come in again so soon, and on the way he broke down. I
tried to cheer him up, but it could not be done. 'You ought to be
thankful,' I told him, 'that you have such a wonderful friend,
and that now you owe nobody in the world anything except her.' I
can assure you, Mrs. Hammond, although I am a hard man, I was
sorry for him that moment. He burst into tears.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' he confessed, 'Mrs. Hammond has been the best friend I
ever had.'</p>

<p>"He even went so far as to tell me that he cared for you more
than any one else in the world; and then he took my breath away.
He confessed that he had forged your name to the cheque."</p>

<p>"That cheque which you have in your pocketbook?" she
faltered.</p>

<p>The Commodore nodded.</p>

<p>"I know what you are thinking," he sighed. "I have parted with
my five hundred thousand francs and all I have is this forged
cheque."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" she asked.</p>

<p>"There is only one thing I can do," he replied. "I am a
wealthy man in a way, but I cannot possibly afford to lose five
hundred thousand francs. I shall present the cheque in the hope
that he has taken sudden leave of his senses and that you really
did give it to him. If the bank refuses to pay it, Michael must
take the consequences. I am fond of the lad, but I am not a
philanthropist to that extent."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hammond sat quite quiet for several minutes and,
something of a physiognomist as he certainly was, Commodore Jasen
could only speculate as to the nature of her thoughts. Presently
she looked across at him. Her manner had lost something of its
decision and her jaw was less prominent.</p>

<p>"You were telling me what he said to you about me," she began
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"To me that makes the situation even sadder," the Commodore
replied, with a very convincing sigh. "The lad is evidently
terribly attached to you. He seems to have had no other affairs
whatever. Every penny of his money has gone in gambling. There is
no doubt whatever about his affection for you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hammond rose abruptly to her feet.</p>

<p>"I see that you have already changed for dinner, Commodore,"
she said. "Will you do me a kindness? Wait here for me half an
hour whilst my maid puts my things on, and escort me to the
Caf&eacute; de Paris, where I promised to meet Michael. I will
make up my mind what I shall do before I come down and we can see
him together."</p>

<p>"I will wait for you with pleasure," the Commodore
promised.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">AT ten minutes to eight Mrs. Hammond reappeared.
She was dressed in black and was followed by a maid, carrying the
usual collection of trifles. She dismissed the latter at once and
opened her bag.</p>

<p>"Commodore Jasen," she said, "you wish to save Michael, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do, so far as I am concerned," he assured
her.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," she decided. "I have made up my mind to
forgive him. If you will hand me over that cheque," she went on,
bringing out a great bundle of notes from her case, "I will give
you three hundred thousand francs in bank notes, and a draft on
New York payable to me, and which I have endorsed, for five
thousand dollars. I shall still owe you a little money, and as
soon as you can work out how much it is, I will give you a
cheque. Is that satisfactory to you?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely," the Commodore assented.</p>

<p>He drew the cheque from his pocketbook and passed it over to
his companion. She occupied herself tearing it into small pieces,
whilst the Commodore filled his pockets with the notes.</p>

<p>"Come along," she invited. "We will walk over to the
Caf&eacute; de Paris. The sooner we let Michael know that
everything is well the better."</p>

<p>The Commodore was a graceful and willing cavalier. As they
crossed the square he touched her arm.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hammond," he said, "I offer you my congratulations. You
have done a very fine thing in a very fine way. You have
certainly made the young man your slave for ever."</p>

<p>She was a woman in whose face there was seldom any marked
expression, but at that moment it seemed to him that her lips
twitched and there was certainly a very soft light in her eyes.
She quickened her pace. Just as they began to pass through the
little network of tables, however, their way was blocked. People
were all rising to their feet and gazing to the far end of the
caf&eacute;, exactly as they had peered the night before. The
black crows of Corsica were once more in evidence. They passed
over the heads of Mrs. Hammond and Commodore Jasen, and once more
they found a scattered resting place amongst the tables of the
outdoor restaurant and on the dancing floor. Mrs. Hammond
shivered as she heard the fluttering of their wings.</p>

<p>"How I hate those birds!" she exclaimed. "There was one
actually sat for a moment on our table last night and looked at
us. I felt as though what that man was saying was the
truth&mdash;that they had come from Suicide Corner and were all
the black spirits of the place. What was that?"</p>

<p>"Some one dropped something, I think," the Commodore replied
nonchalantly.</p>

<p>His companion quickened her pace. They reached the enclosure
but there was no welcoming <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> to
greet them. Every one seemed to be crowding round the table where
Michael usually sat. By chance the crowd parted for a moment.
They saw the young man sprawling forward, his hands hanging
helplessly by his side, the revolver still smoking two feet away
upon the pavement. On the table in front of him, undisturbed even
by the report, one of the oldest and wickedest-looking of the
birds had alighted, and was perched, with his beak half open, and
the light of all the evil in the world shining out of his angry
eyes.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">"HE was afraid," the lady sobbed, as Commodore
Jasen escorted her back to the hotel half an hour later, "that I
should never forgive him! If only he had waited!"</p>

<p>"At any rate," her companion reminded her piously, as he felt
his pockets, "it would be, I am sure, some consolation to him to
know that his debts are all paid."</p>

<h2><a id="story9" name="story9">IX.&mdash;LORD DRATTEN'S LAND
DEAL</a></h2>

<h3>No record of magazine publication in this form found.<br>
Presumably appeared in <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i> in 1932.<br>
<br>
A modified version of this story appeared as<br>
"Give a Man Rope Enough" in <i>Holly Leaves</i>, 26 Nov 1932.</h3>

<p class="first">LORD DRATTEN began to lose just a little of his
robust assurance as his Rolls Royce glided up the ascent from
Villefranche, and the white villas of Beaulieu became visible on
the hillside. It was an enterprise indeed, this to which he was
committed! Never had he known his companion more charming, never
had she seemed to him more utterly desirable. That she was
beautiful he, in common with the rest of the crowd at the Cap
d'Antibes, had always known. That she had charm, the whole world
recognised, a charm which even he, a coarse-fibred person, had
felt from the first moment he had ever spoken to her. But this
morning it seemed to him that he had discovered a new attraction.
The courtesy which she owed him as her prospective host had
seemed to him tinged with a delightful savour of coquetry, a
personal and wholly inspiring thing. There had been times
previously when her aloofness had damped his ardour. This morning
his confidence was in a measure re&euml;stablished. Yet, as they
slackened speed, and the car swung through the tall, iron gates
leading down to the R&eacute;serve, he was conscious once more of
a most unaccustomed quiver of nervousness. He had just
sensibility enough to realise that there was something about his
companion which placed her quite apart from the women whom he had
known and trifled with. He had to recall an old club aphorism to
restore his confidence. "All women are alike <i>au fond</i>"! Of
course they were!</p>

<p>Caroline gave a little cry of delight as she caught sight of
the low, picturesque restaurant, with its setting of brilliantly
hued flowers, quaint statuary, well-trimmed trees and shrubs.
Through the windows were opaque visions of the sea, flawlessly
blue.</p>

<p>"How delightful!" she exclaimed, "I never saw such an
enchanting place in my life. How good of you to bring me!"</p>

<p>Lord Dratten smiled,&mdash;a smile which somehow gave the
impression that he believed himself to be the only man in the
world who would have thought of taking her to the R&eacute;serve
at Beaulieu, and the only man in the world generous enough to
invite a guest there. He was a fine fellow in his way. Six foot
three, with bulky shoulders, large body, head with a mass of
brown hair, features not perhaps so good. There had been some of
the young set at Antibes who had called him "a bumptious old
ass," and there were certainly one or two who, in spite of his
financial success, had found him stupid. Caroline herself,
notwithstanding her good manners, had been wondering half the
time during their drive why she had accepted his invitation. The
car came to a standstill in the gardens, but some distance from
the restaurant. A smiling commissionaire in brilliant scarlet
livery threw open the door of the vehicle with a flourish, and
Lord Dratten swung his large and somewhat clumsy body out on to
the avenue. Caroline accepted his hand and alighted
gracefully.</p>

<p>"Why do we stop here?" she asked, as soon as her escort had
finished giving directions to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>Lord Dratten was not at his best. Caroline's question was so
direct, her innocence so transparent. He coughed and glanced at
the commissionaire, who stepped on one side, as though inviting
them to enter.</p>

<p>"The fact of it is, my dear Miss Caroline," he confided, in a
pompous whisper, "the best class of people&mdash;er&mdash;don't
frequent the restaurant.... I wondered whether you would not be
more comfortable&mdash;er&mdash;over here. Very pleasant
rooms&mdash;all to ourselves, you know! Good service! None of
that beastly music!"</p>

<p>Caroline had already removed her foot from the threshold of
the hotel. She was genuinely taken by surprise, but she
understood. Yet, neither by word nor by any change in her
expression did she betray the fact.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think so," she exclaimed. "It seems so dull in
here and I think the restaurant looks most attractive. I love the
music too. Do you mind?"</p>

<p>She was beckoning him to follow her, already a yard or two
away on the avenue, and apparently fascinated by the pool in
which a small shoal of melancholy fish were endeavouring to
forget their predestined end. Lord Dratten <i>did</i> mind very
much indeed, for he had made a special journey over to be sure of
getting his favourite suite, had whispered a word into the ear of
his accustomed waiter, and had, in short, made all his
arrangements with the care and completeness of the accomplished
<i>boulevardier</i>. Apart from his own natural disappointment,
he was conscious of the covertly smiling faces of the
commissionaire and the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>. His
vanity was hurt. Caroline, however, was already on her cheerful
way to the restaurant and affected not to notice his
discomfiture.</p>

<p>"I am dying for a cocktail," she confided, "and the bar looks
too divine. How kind of you to bring me to such a charming
place!"</p>

<p>Lord Dratten made his last effort, when the restaurant
<i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> had temporarily deserted them
at the bar, to enquire whether a sufficient number of the
succulent <i>mesdemoiselles</i> of Beaulieu could be collected
for the luncheon of two hungry people. He leaned towards his
companion in his best Lothario-like manner.</p>

<p>"Stuffy-looking lot of people down here, don't you think?" he
whispered disparagingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I think everything here is delightful," Caroline declared
with enthusiasm. "And what a view!"</p>

<p>"Better from the little room I had chosen," he insinuated,
with a wave of the hand backwards. "All to ourselves, too! Just
the same luncheon. Shall I tell them to serve it there?"</p>

<p>Caroline remained extraordinarily dense.</p>

<p>"Sweet of you to think of it," she rejoined, "but I adore this
room, and the <i>chef d'orchestre</i> and I are great friends. I
know I shall enjoy the music."</p>

<p>The <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> brought good news
concerning the <i>mesdemoiselles</i> of Beaulieu and Caroline
followed him to the table. Lord Dratten tried to console himself
with the obvious fact that he was entertaining the best-looking
and most chic young woman in the place, and was consequently the
most envied man there. The fact soothed his vanity, but nothing
could have made him other than a dull companion. He talked in a
loud voice, mostly about himself and his doings, and complained
without cause when he dared. By the time the large bottle of
brandy arrived, he had almost recovered his good humour and was
prepared to play his trump card.</p>

<p>"By the by," he said, leaning confidentially across the table,
"you won't mind having just a look at Monte Carlo after luncheon?
I want to see my bankers there and we might have an hour at the
tables afterwards. I keep a dinner suit at the
Paris&mdash;sometimes stay the night there. Bit of a change. What
do you say?"</p>

<p>Caroline sighed and shook her head.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry," she told him. "I have a dressmaker coming
over from Cannes at four o'clock and an early cocktail party.
Besides, I was at Monte yesterday and I am going again to-morrow.
One can have too much of a good thing, can't one?... May I have
another cup of this delicious coffee?"</p>

<p>This time Lord Dratten failed to hide his annoyance. He was
distinctly angry. The girl had no right&mdash;it seemed almost as
though she were trifling with him!</p>

<p>"Sorry," he persisted gruffly, "I am afraid I shall have to
call there for an hour or so. I thought you understood that."</p>

<p>Her amiability was unruffled.</p>

<p>"But what does it matter?" she protested. "<i>Ma&icirc;tre
d'h&ocirc;tel</i>," she went on, addressing one of the head
waiters who had scarcely left her elbow, "can you get me a
taxicab to go to Antibes?"</p>

<p>"<i>Mais parfaitement, Madame</i>," the man replied promptly.
"There is one who waits now. I go to secure him."</p>

<p>He bustled off.</p>

<p>Lord Dratten, who understood no French, leaned across the
table with frowning face.</p>

<p>"What's all that about?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Everything is arranged," she assured him. "My taxicab is
waiting now. So I think, dear Lord Dratten, if you will excuse
me," she went on, closing her vanity case and rising to her feet,
"I had better take advantage of its being here. Such a delicious
luncheon, and <i>so</i> many thanks. Now I insist upon it that
you do not get up. You must finish your brandy comfortably. We
shall meet again this evening. Au revoir."</p>

<p>She was gone with a little wave of the hand, profusely
escorted by the <i>patron</i>, the <i>chef d'orchestre</i> and
two or three <i>ma&icirc;tres d'h&ocirc;tel</i>. She was already
through the door at the further end of the room and stepping into
the taxicab before Lord Dratten had fully recovered himself. He
expressed his feelings in two different ways: he helped himself
to a double liqueur brandy from the big bottle, held his glass
critically in front of him, and he uttered one single but
heartfelt expletive&mdash;</p>

<p>"Damn!"</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">LORD DRATTEN'S waistcoat was joyously uplifted,
for the food and wine at Caroline's return luncheon party about a
week later had both been of the best. There was a flush upon his
cheeks, a moistness in his eyes. More than ever he regretted that
his little escapade with her had not been a complete success. Few
women whom he knew could have ordered a luncheon or wines like
that. She was so excellent a hostess that she ventured to call to
order two of her guests.</p>

<p>"Commodore," she remonstrated, "you and Mr. Crowhurst are
talking business far too much. Lord Dratten and I, and Zo&euml;
too," she added, with a glance at the girl who was seated on his
other side, "are feeling neglected."</p>

<p>The Commodore broke off abruptly in his conversation. A piece
of paper, upon which he had been making figures, he thrust into
his pocket.</p>

<p>"My profound apologies, dear hostess," he said. "I am afraid
that for a minute or two I got led away upon my hobby."</p>

<p>Caroline nodded her forgiveness.</p>

<p>"Commodore Jasen," she explained to her guest of honour,
"although he is a very wealthy man, is like all Americans. Money-
making is his sport. He cannot keep away from it."</p>

<p>"Do you follow the market out here?" Lord Dratten asked.</p>

<p>The Commodore looked shocked.</p>

<p>"I never gamble," he said.</p>

<p>"The Commodore," Mr. Crowhurst intervened, "has been one of my
best clients, and one of my most successful ones in buying land
out here."</p>

<p>"As to being successful," Jasen observed, "I am afraid no one
could claim any credit for that during the last two years.
Whatever odd bit of land you bought you made money on."</p>

<p>"Seems like a fairy tale," Crowhurst observed, toying with his
pencil. "I have one client&mdash;sha'n't mention his
name&mdash;who settled down here with a pension. Quite hard up he
was. Couldn't even play his little game of <i>chemin de fer</i>,
and owned a motor bicycle and sidecar. Some one left him fifty
thousand francs. That's every penny he had when he came into my
office about eighteen months ago. He was a shrewd fellow, I must
say that for him, but apart from that, he acted nearly the whole
of the time upon our advice. To-day he is worth at least five
millions, he has built himself a beautiful villa and he drives a
Lancia car. If he had held on to his properties, he would have
been worth to-day at least twice as much, in three years' time
three times as much."</p>

<p>Lord Dratten was sitting up in his chair. There was a curious
light in his eyes, which were no longer moist. He was listening
intently to every word.</p>

<p>"A wonderful boom down here, must have been," he observed,
with clumsily affected indifference. "All over now, I suppose,
though?"</p>

<p>The land agent smiled in superior fashion.</p>

<p>"That's how I like to hear people talk," he admitted. "Keeps
the prices from soaring too much. As this is not a gathering of
business people, I don't mind telling you what my real opinion
is. There's a hundred per cent. rise to be looked for in
practically every plot of land from Fr&eacute;jus to Nice, and in
this immediate vicinity I would venture to put it at two hundred
per cent. The figures of the last two years' transactions would
pretty near send any one crazy, and to-day, if any one comes to
us for land, or what we call a Number One class villa, we have
scarcely a thing to show to them."</p>

<p>"After all, I am not sure that it is to be wondered at," the
Commodore reflected. "Where in the world could you find a climate
like this, so many beautiful casinos, golf clubs, bathing
spots&mdash;everything for a man's enjoyment&mdash;so much
civilisation and such an environment? It was just a question of
finding out what the summer was really like here, one or two of
the hotels keeping open, and the man at the back of Juan Casino
having the foresight to see what was coming. My dear Caroline,"
he added, rising to his feet, "I am afraid I must excuse myself.
My architect is coming to see me this afternoon. I happen to know
that the builder made half a million francs out of the villas on
the last plot of land I sold him, so I am thinking of turning
greedy and building myself, this time. After all, it is rather
amusing, and one must have some occupation."</p>

<p>"What about the Everett property?" Crowhurst asked.</p>

<p>The Commodore hesitated.</p>

<p>"I am more than half inclined to go for it," he admitted. "I
know the money's there. It isn't that at all. I don't like
options, though. I'd be more willing to give the four millions
straight out if your client really wants to deal."</p>

<p>"You will get it for that in the long run," the other
argued.</p>

<p>The Commodore stood irresolute.</p>

<p>"Courage," Caroline called out.</p>

<p>"What are four millions?" Zo&euml; exclaimed, with a shrug of
the shoulders. "Think what you have made!"</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed as though the Commodore had made up his
mind. Then apparently he changed it.</p>

<p>"I will let you know in a day or two, Crowhurst," he promised.
"After all, I must not be greedy. I made several enemies, I am
afraid, by buying the Michael's property. A wonderful luncheon,
Miss Loyd, and&mdash;as usual&mdash;a perfect hostess!"</p>

<p>He took his leave. The others resumed their seats for a few
moments. Lord Dratten's eyes, although they seemed to have become
smaller, were certainly brighter. He thrust his hands into his
trousers pockets.</p>

<p>"Reminds me of old days," he remarked. "I have been in a few
land booms in my time. Done some wonderful deals, too. Bought a
bit of land in the city once. When I bid, I never reckoned out
what it would come to&mdash;it was some thirty pounds a foot.
Bought it unexpectedly one day after lunch and had to find four
hundred thousand pounds the next day."</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" Caroline murmured.</p>

<p>"It is very romantic," Zo&euml; declared. "I like to hear how
rich, clever men make money."</p>

<p>Lord Dratten helped himself to another cigar. He leaned back
in his chair.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "that is one thing that women have not taken
away from us yet. They may write books and paint pictures and go
into the House of Commons, but they have not yet learned how to
put a big business deal through. They have not even found their
way on to the Stock Exchange," he added, with a chuckle.... "So
there has been a lot of money made round here, Mr.
Crowhurst?"</p>

<p>"A great deal," the latter agreed, "and there will be a great
deal more. Five years ago my father and I and an office boy ran
our place. To-day we have nine clerks, our own salaried
architect, three typists, and two men with motor cars continually
going up and down the coast, and even now we are short-
handed."</p>

<p>"What are your business hours&mdash;your own, I mean?" Lord
Dratten asked, with well-assumed carelessness. "Supposing I
wanted to come in about renting a villa or something, when should
I be likely to find you?"</p>

<p>"The only certainty," was the dubious reply, "would be between
nine and ten in the morning, and five and six at night. I am run
off my legs most of the rest of the time. As regards a villa,
though, we have an excellent staff who might be able to fix you
up."</p>

<p>"I prefer to deal with principals," Lord Dratten boomed. "As a
rule, when I buy or sell or hire, there is big business in
it."</p>

<p>"Ring up and make an appointment," Mr. Crowhurst suggested, as
he bent over his hostess' hand. "A wonderful luncheon, Miss Loyd.
I have enjoyed it thoroughly. I should not hurry away
either&mdash;I am just as well out of the office these
days&mdash;but my wife wants the boat. Come across you again, I
hope, Lord Dratten."</p>

<p>The latter nodded.</p>

<p>"I might decide to have a flutter in land," he said
thoughtfully. "If so I will look you up."</p>

<p>Jonathan Crowhurst knew his man, and he was not surprised
when, at a quarter to ten the following morning, Lord Dratten was
shown into his office.</p>

<p>"What can I do for your lordship?" he asked briskly. "I can
see we are in for a busy day. Hear those telephones ringing? One
would think half the inhabitants of the United States had made up
their minds to leave their own markets alone for a bit and do a
little solid speculation!"</p>

<p>Lord Dratten accepted a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I am a wealthy man, you know, Mr. Crowhurst.
No one likes to have too much idle money. I have some just now.
Have you anything to suggest?"</p>

<p>Mr. Crowhurst did not appear to be enthusiastic.</p>

<p>"In a week or two's time I may have," he said. "I believe the
Biot lands will be on the market then, and we can commence doing
business. Just at present I should scarcely know what to put you
on to. Of course there are heaps of small propositions."</p>

<p>"No good to me," Lord Dratten interrupted. "I am a big
man&mdash;in every sense of the word," he laughed, patting his
stomach, "and I like big business. What about this estate the
Commodore was speaking of yesterday?"</p>

<p>Crowhurst shook his head.</p>

<p>"I think he means having that. He would have come to terms
before now, but he likes to do business his own way, and I must
admit that the old lady who owns the estate is one of the
crankiest women I ever knew."</p>

<p>"It's still open, is it, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is still open," the agent admitted, without
enthusiasm. "The only thing is, even if I felt at liberty to
discuss it with you, you would probably feel the same as I do
about it."</p>

<p>"Let us hear the crab," Lord Dratten begged. "You don't commit
yourself to anything by talking about it."</p>

<p>"That's right," Crowhurst agreed. "Well, it's a matter of that
large property between Eden Roc and the Ch&acirc;teau. It is
really the finest piece of land on the coast and might be worth
anything. The owner wants to sell one day, and then she changes
her mind. All that she will do is to grant an option, provided a
price can be agreed on."</p>

<p>"I don't quite follow you," Lord Dratten observed.</p>

<p>"You would not," the other said. "It's an old-fashioned way of
doing business. She has still got valuers on the place, you see,
and she professes that she has not made up her mind exactly what
she wants for it. Well, she will let you have an option
for&mdash;say a hundred thousand francs. That means we can't sell
the estate to any one else if you are willing to give the price
that she ultimately decides upon. Her last price was two million,
seven hundred thousand francs. Very well. We had an American from
Nice who paid the hundred thousand francs and hoped to get the
property. The valuers, however, persuaded Madame that the price
was too low, and the man got the hundred thousand francs back a
few days ago. The only advantage to him was, of course, that she
could not sell it to any one else while he held the option."</p>

<p>"It seems a one-sided sort of arrangement," Lord Dratten
reflected.</p>

<p>"I don't know that it is, really," Crowhurst rejoined. "She
knows perfectly well there are half a dozen people who would buy
it to-morrow. It has not been in her hands for more than a month
or two and there never has been a correct valuation. It will be
decided upon the first of the month. Very well&mdash;supposing
to-day she were willing to sell you what she calls an option at a
hundred and fifty thousand francs, on the first of next month she
will tell you what she wants for the property. If you are willing
to buy it at that or any lower price that might be agreed upon,
your hundred and fifty thousand francs comes off the purchase
price. If you say it is too dear, we give you back the money, and
all that you lose is your first chance of purchase."</p>

<p>"Supposing you take me over and show me the property," Lord
Dratten suggested.</p>

<p>The agent smiled uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I could scarcely do that," he objected. "You see,
we have done some very large deals with the Commodore, and,
although he hates this option business, I honestly believe he
would pay to-morrow what the final valuation would come out at. I
don't mind telling you, Lord Dratten, that one of the valuers is
a friend of mine, and they are not putting it too high. They want
the land sold and cleared out of the way. I don't believe the
final valuation will be a penny more than three million, seven
hundred thousand francs, and it is worth&mdash;mind you, I know
what I am talking about, Lord Dratten&mdash;it is worth five
millions of any one's money!"</p>

<p>"Well, the Commodore's had his whack," Lord Dratten persisted.
"It would do no harm to take me out and show it to me. I don't
want a valuer&mdash;not at this stage of the proceedings, anyway.
I will take your word&mdash;your written word, of
course&mdash;for the number of hectares involved. You show me the
land and, if I think it is good enough, I will give you my cheque
for the amount of the option straight away."</p>

<p>Mr. Crowhurst seemed terribly perplexed.</p>

<p>"I'd sooner do anything than offend the Commodore," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"Well, you can think about that after we have been over," Lord
Dratten pointed out. "There's no harm in my seeing the property,
anyway. I will pay you a fee for showing it to me."</p>

<p>Jonathan Crowhurst closed his Derby desk with a little
slam.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "Come on. I feel like a little fresh air
this morning, anyway."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">LORD DRATTEN was at any rate a hard worker. He
walked from one end to the other of the great stone wall which
divided the estate he had come to visit from the sea&mdash;a very
solidly built affair without gate or outlet of any sort. He
tramped over the kitchen gardens, which were in a moderate state
of cultivation, he walked through the pine woods, he studied the
somewhat depressed-looking flower gardens. He paid particular
attention to the small farm and the accommodation for the outside
servants. The house itself he went over, but dismissed with a
grunt.</p>

<p>"Worth what it will fetch to a housebreaker," was his only
comment.</p>

<p>It was twelve o'clock before he had finished his
investigations, by which time Mr. Crowhurst was hoarse with
answering questions and thoroughly exhausted. They stood on the
broad terrace and looked out across the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>"A fine sea view," Lord Dratten observed.</p>

<p>The agent flinched a little but said nothing. He was busy
wiping the perspiration from his forehead.</p>

<p>"We have gone quite as far as we need for the day," Lord
Dratten decided. "Step into my car, Mr. Crowhurst. We will drive
to the hotel."</p>

<p>"I should like," Mr. Crowhurst admitted fervently, "to go
somewhere where we can get a drink!"</p>

<p>"I sympathise with you entirety," the other replied. "My
motto, though, always is 'Business First.' We will split a gin
and ginger in my room."</p>

<p>They drove off to the hotel, where Lord Dratten led the way to
his sitting room. He gave an order to the waiter and produced
pen, ink and paper.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Crowhurst," he said, "I have inspected this
property. I gather that you are only prepared to talk business on
the very strange terms insisted upon by your client?"</p>

<p>"I ought not to talk business at all," the agent replied
uneasily. "I ought, at any rate, to ring up the Commodore
first."</p>

<p>"No necessity to do anything of the sort," Lord Dratten
rejoined sharply. "One man's money is as good as another's, I
suppose, and the Commodore had his chance. You cannot name a
price for the property, so I will consider it on your own terms.
What amount do you suggest for what you call the option? It is
not, of course, an ordinary option at all."</p>

<p>"One hundred and fifty thousand francs," Mr. Crowhurst said
unwillingly.</p>

<p>"Very well," Lord Dratten proceeded, "I take it that this is
the understanding. I give you here a cheque for a hundred and
fifty thousand francs. If the price which your principals put
forward to me within the next week or ten days is acceptable to
me, and I buy the property, that hundred and fifty thousand
francs is deducted from the purchase price. If they ask me such a
sum that I do not buy, the matter is at an end and the hundred
and fifty thousand francs is returned to me. Have I got it
rightly?"</p>

<p>"Quite correct," the agent admitted.</p>

<p>Lord Dratten wrote out the cheque and handed it across the
table. He then wrote a few lines upon a sheet of paper and passed
it over to the agent.</p>

<p>"The rest is up to you, Mr. Crowhurst," he said. "Sign the few
lines I have written&mdash;you see there exactly your own
proposition&mdash;give me a receipt for the cheque, finish that
bilious-looking drink, and we will go down to Eden Roc and have a
swim."</p>

<p>Mr. Crowhurst did everything that he was bidden without
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"I feel you have rather had your own way with me, Lord
Dratten," he remarked, as he pocketed the cheque. "You
are&mdash;if you don't mind my saying so&mdash;a forceful man. I
didn't mean to do this. How I shall face the Commodore, I don't
know."</p>

<p>Lord Dratten stretched himself out. He was certainly a fine
figure of a man.</p>

<p>"We have our own way of doing business in the City of London,"
he told the agent.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">IT was the same little company who met together
for lunch at the Eden Roc some ten days later. This time it was
Lord Dratten who was the host. He sat at the head of the
table&mdash;magnificent in white flannels and white silk shirt
open at the throat. He was a dominant, if not altogether a
pleasing figure. On one side of him sat Caroline, on the other
Zo&euml;. Both&mdash;to all appearance&mdash;sufficiently
impressed. Commodore Jasen and Mr. Crowhurst completed the
party.</p>

<p>"Any more land speculations, Commodore?" his host asked him,
during the progress of the meal.</p>

<p>The Commodore shook his head.</p>

<p>"I have been gardening instead," he confided. "Unselfish work
I call it that&mdash;toiling in another man's vineyard. The only
deal I was rather anxious to bring to a head was the Everett
estate, and my friend Crowhurst here seems to have kept off the
subject for the last week. What about it, Crowhurst? Have you
been able to persuade that old woman out of her ridiculous option
scheme?"</p>

<p>The agent drank half a glass of wine and summoned up his
courage.</p>

<p>"There was no need to do that, Commodore. Plenty of other
people willing to humour her."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you have been doing business with some one
else for that estate?" the Commodore asked with uplifted
eyebrows.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, I couldn't help it," Crowhurst replied. "The
old lady refused to consider any other method of doing business.
She wanted to keep the thing going as long as she could, before
she named a definite price. You hung fire at the option, so I had
no alternative but to look elsewhere. Some one else would have
chipped in if I had not."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would be as well," Lord Dratten said, in his
resonant bass voice from the head of the table, "to take the
Commodore into our confidence. I have purchased an option,
Commodore, upon the Everett Estates for a hundred and fifty
thousand francs."</p>

<p>"The devil you have!" the Commodore exclaimed. "I beg your
pardon, Miss Caroline," he went on. "You must forgive me. I was a
little startled. I had no idea that the property was being
offered elsewhere."</p>

<p>Mr. Crowhurst plucked up a little courage.</p>

<p>"I regret the necessity, Commodore," he said, "but it had to
be done. Madame Everett would deal on that basis. You would not
make up your mind. Every agent on the Riviera is yapping round
her villa all day. I had to go ahead."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen sipped his wine and for a moment or two looked
very depressed. Then he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about business, Commodore," Caroline
said gently, "but I do not think you ought to blame Mr. Crowhurst
or Lord Dratten. You had the first chance. Mr. Crowhurst ran the
risk of losing the business altogether if he did not act and we
know what sort of a man Lord Dratten is."</p>

<p>The Commodore sighed.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right," he admitted. "Lord Dratten, you
have&mdash;as we say in America&mdash;put one over on me! I wish
you luck!"</p>

<p>Lord Dratten's smile was maddening. Caroline deliberately
looked away.</p>

<p>"I have made a fortune by my business habits and methods,"
Lord Dratten declared. "Every one in the city of London knows
that when I am interested, there is something doing. No one can
say that I have ever been guilty of anything like sharp practice,
or that I have taken advantage of a friend, but on the other hand
I do not think you would find any one able to boast that he got
the better of me in a business deal."</p>

<p>"You have certainly nipped in on me this time," the Commodore
confessed. "When is the old lady going to make up her mind,
Crowhurst?"</p>

<p>"She made up her mind yesterday evening," the latter replied.
"She fixed the price at three millions eight hundred thousand,
and at that price Lord Dratten pronounced&mdash;'I have
bought.'"</p>

<p>Caroline looked at him breathlessly.</p>

<p>"You have bought the Everett Estates?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I have bought them for three millions, eight hundred thousand
francs," Lord Dratten replied pompously, "less one hundred and
fifty thousand francs which I have already paid as deposit, and
less a certain amount of commission," he added, with a smile, "to
our friend Mr. Crowhurst here. Just a holiday deal, I look upon
it as. Nothing tremendous. Just something to keep one's hand in.
As soon as the papers are made out, I shall pay over my cheque
and decide what to do with the property. I may build a villa for
myself. I have often thought of it. For a million or a million
and a half, one could build a very tidy little place on the
present site. I should have the advantage, Commodore Jasen," he
reflected, "of having you for a neighbour."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen filled his glass and pushed the bottle across
the table.</p>

<p>"To show that there is no ill feeling, I will drink to the
health of our new neighbour."</p>

<p>They all drank to him. Lord Dratten was gracious and
impressive.</p>

<p>"If I decide to come and live here," he said, "I am sure I
shall be very happy with such nice people around me. On the other
hand," he added, "money talks. I have an idea that if I put the
property into the market, I might get even as much as five
millions. I was looking around early this morning&mdash;went out
in a motor boat&mdash;there is not a property along the coast
with such a sea frontage."</p>

<p>There was a silence which any one else might have thought
curious. Caroline was watching a speed boat passing the rafts.
Zo&euml; was bending close over the fig which she was peeling.
The Commodore was gazing up at the ceiling. Crowhurst was
fidgeting uneasily in his chair. Lord Dratten refilled his glass.
He drank the Commodore's health.</p>

<p>"No ill feeling, I hope, Commodore?" he said. "This option
business is not so bad after all, eh?"</p>

<p>"You seem to have got what you deserved out of it, anyway,"
was the Commodore's gloomy reply.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">CAROLINE came in from her second bathe the
following morning with shining eyes and glowing cheeks. She
ascended the stone steps gracefully as usual, but with many a
pause to exchange greetings with friends and acquaintances. At
the entrance to the bar she closed her light green parasol and
wrapped her peignoir of the same colour a little more closely
around her. She was the cynosure of a good many admiring glances,
but there was one man, who had been walking up and down the
place, who had other things in his eyes. He stopped her on the
way to the dressing rooms.</p>

<p>"Can I have a word with you, Miss Loyd?" he asked a little
brusquely.</p>

<p>She looked at him with upraised eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Certainly you can presently, Lord Dratten," she said. "You
don't expect me to sit down like this, do you? I shall only be
about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>She passed on into the dressing rooms. Lord Dratten drunk a
cocktail and looked as though it had violently disagreed with
him. He sat down at a remote table near a window and awaited her
coming with such patience as he could. It was fully twenty
minutes before she emerged from the dressing rooms, immaculate in
wide white silk pyjamas, her eyes and cheeks still aglow. She
paused to speak to some friends at the counter, then she made her
way to the table before which Lord Dratten was standing.</p>

<p>"You want to give me a cocktail?" she asked sweetly. "Thank
you so much. I would rather have tomato juice&mdash;may I?"</p>

<p>He muttered an order. She looked at him in some surprise.</p>

<p>"Is it my fancy, or are you a little disturbed this morning?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"I am disturbed," he replied. "I do not understand these
tricks."</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it," she begged. "Only don't look so
furious."</p>

<p>"It is about this Everett Estates deal, of course," he said,
"and I don't see why not one of you had anything to say about it
at luncheon time. I drove down with my architect this morning and
young Crowhurst's head man. I went straight to the sea wall to
decide what entrances I would have on to the beach and where to
build my harbourage."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you can't have any entrances on to the beach,"
Caroline exclaimed. "You can't build a harbourage either.
Whatever made you think you could?"</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment. There were a good many words which
he contrived to choke back.</p>

<p>"If a man buys an estate in an ordinary way," he said, "he
expects that the sea frontage attached to it belongs also to him.
It seems that there is some underhand work about here. We did our
business quickly, I admit, and all verification of the plans was
naturally to come when I paid the deposit for the purchase money.
But only buying an option, I just looked around and took things
as they stood or seemed to stand. This morning I have seen the
original plans. The sea wall seems to bound the property. Some
one else," he went on, "who owns a wretched little villa on the
right-hand side of that dirty little road by the side of my
property, owns the frontage all the way down to the other end of
my wall."</p>

<p>"Didn't you know that?" Caroline asked.</p>

<p>Again Lord Dratten opened his lips and again he struggled with
a stream of profanity.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose," he asked, "that I should have been such a
damn' fool as to buy even an option on the property, if I had?
What I must confess did surprise me was to hear that you, Miss
Loyd, own that miserable little villa and its ridiculous rights
of frontage."</p>

<p>Caroline nodded brightly.</p>

<p>"I bought it two months ago," she admitted. "I knew the villa
was not worth much, but it seemed to me that the frontage was
worth quite a great deal of money. Every one has been doing so
well in property here, I thought this was my chance."</p>

<p>"What price do you want for the sea frontage?" Lord Dratten
asked brusquely.</p>

<p>"My dear man," she remonstrated, "are these London ways of
doing business? Can't you ask me a little more civilly?"</p>

<p>"I find it rather hard to be civil with you," he
confessed.</p>

<p>Caroline's thoughts travelled suddenly backwards and she
laughed in her chair. Lord Dratten met her eyes and clenched his
fists. He knew very well what she was laughing at.</p>

<p>"Of course I shall go to law about this," he said, "but in the
meantime perhaps you would quote your own price."</p>

<p>She sipped the tomato juice which the waiter had just brought.
She was looking down the coast with reminiscent eyes.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Lord Dratten," she said. "I was just thinking how
wonderful the restaurant at Beaulieu must be looking to-day. What
was it you asked me?"</p>

<p>"I asked you to name your price for the sea-frontage rights to
the Everett Estates," he said grimly.</p>

<p>She shook her head, finished her tomato juice and rose.</p>

<p>"My dear man," she said, "they are not for sale."</p>

<h2><a id="story10" name="story10">X.&mdash;THE COMMODORE'S LAST
CIGAR</a></h2>

<h3>No record of magazine publication in this form found.<br>
Presumably appeared in <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i> in 1932.</h3>

<p class="first">MR. JONATHAN CROWHURST looked regretfully at his
watch and rose to his feet a fine figure of a man, though
inclined to be thin in the flank and shoulders. He had dined
exceedingly well. His collar was a little crumpled, his tie
disarranged, and there was cigar ash over his trousers.</p>

<p>"Awfully good of you, Commodore," he declared, holding out his
hand towards his host, "to make my visit so pleasant. I am to
take it that yours is a firm offer?"</p>

<p>"You have it in writing," Jasen reminded him. "I will give you
seven and a half millions for the house, grounds and the whole of
the land. As regards the furniture, I won't take a stick of it.
That must all be removed within six months of the transaction
being concluded."</p>

<p>"Don't know that I blame you," Crowhurst said, smiling. "It's
a mouldy lot."</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine why Lord Wyndham, when he is as near as
Marseilles, does not come down here and collect his own
treasures," the Commodore observed. "We might have had a talk and
settled the matter up, then and there."</p>

<p>"His lordship is peculiar," the agent replied. "The
Ch&acirc;teau being occupied, he would certainly stay nowhere
else in the vicinity. Besides, when he is once on a P. &amp; O.
he likes to stay there. I shall see him to-morrow morning about
eight, hand over the things I have come to fetch, and we shall
have plenty of time to talk your offer over then. I shall be back
at night and I promise that I shall endeavour to bring you a
definite reply."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen knocked the ash from his cigar, rose to his
feet, and touched the bell.</p>

<p>"I should like to know one way or another," he said. "I have
promised to go over the Mougins Ch&acirc;teau, if nothing comes
of my offer to you. Sure you won't have another glass of the
brandy?"</p>

<p>"Not now, thanks. I will do my business down in the cellars
first. Then, if I may, I will look in and say good-bye to
you."</p>

<p>"Are you motoring to Marseilles?" the Commodore asked.</p>

<p>Jonathan Crowhurst shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, I am motoring as far as Cagnes," he said. "I shall get on
the eleven-five train there. I have arranged to leave the car
outside and the garage man is going to fetch it."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen turned to the butler who had opened the
door.</p>

<p>"Broadman," he explained, "Mr. Crowhurst is going down to the
cellars. Turn on the lights and if he needs any assistance see
that he has it."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," the man replied.</p>

<p>"I sha'n't want anything, thanks," Crowhurst said, as he
followed the man out. "I will look in and say good night to you
when I have packed up my little lot."</p>

<p>He swaggered out, and there was a slight smile upon Commodore
Jasen's face, as he turned round in his chair and filled his
glass with choice old Burgundy. He sniffed the wine
appreciatively and sipped it. He knew very well that, unless
miracles happened, he had said his last good night to Mr.
Jonathan Crowhurst.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">LIKE many of the almost perfect enterprises in
which Commodore Jasen and his friends had, from time to time in
their adventurous career, been engaged, the present one was not
an affair to be hurried through. Time was of no particular
consideration, but absolute thoroughness was a necessity. It was
three quarters of an hour before the door of the dining room
opened and the house agent made apparent reappearance. The cigar
ash was still upon his tweed trousers, his cravat was still ill-
arranged, and his face flushed with the generous wine he had been
drinking. He was wearing a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles,
however, which slightly altered his appearance. The Commodore's
eyes flashed over him critically.</p>

<p>"Not bad," he commented. "You'll do. Especially in this light.
Don't forget the swagger. Any trouble?"</p>

<p>"None at all," was the prompt reply. "You were right. It was
the rest of the emeralds he was after. I've got them and the
Rajah's diamonds."</p>

<p>"You put him out easily?"</p>

<p>"Not the flicker of an eyelid, not a sound," was the confident
reply. "He is on his way down the tunnel now to the boat."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"You had better be getting off," he observed. "Don't
forget&mdash;call in at the Majestic for a whisky. Crowhurst
always drinks it with water. Tell the barman that you are
catching the train to Marseilles&mdash;Jim his name is&mdash;nod
to any one who looks as though he may know you. Take any message
you can collect for his lordship."</p>

<p>"That's all right, Commodore. Don't you worry about me. I
spent a fortnight watching that fellow Crowhurst. I know his
runs, I know his slang, I know his mannerisms. It will be two
months before you hear from me&mdash;if that oil tank ever does
get to the Persian Gulf."</p>

<p>"We will possess our souls in patience," the Commodore
observed. "Our last words have already been spoken. You had
better be getting into the car. Drive slowly through Juan and
don't forget to wave your hand to any one who looks as though
they knew you."</p>

<p>"Like to have a look at the emeralds?"</p>

<p>"I will see them in Columbo," the Commodore replied.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE Chef de la S&ucirc;ret&eacute; of
Marseilles, having welcomed warmly his dear friend Pierre
Lavalon, the celebrated detective from Paris, permitted himself
to indulge in an outburst of irritation.</p>

<p>"It is unfair, my friend," he declared. "Marseilles is no
worse than other great cities, except that we happen to be a
seaport and therefore we have perhaps more criminals coming and
going. But if there's a tragedy, an accident, a disappearance,
you all come to Marseilles! You swoop down upon me. Half the
crimes that are committed in France are supposed to be committed
in my neighbourhood. It sounds well to say 'the missing man was
last seen in Marseilles,' or 'a body fished up in the harbour of
Marseilles is awaiting identification.'"</p>

<p>Monsieur Lavalon smiled sympathetically as he rolled and lit a
cigarette.</p>

<p>"My friend," he admitted, "you have some reason. Yet, when you
consider this matter, you must agree that there are grounds for
my visit here. This unfortunate Jonathan Crowhurst, the English
house and land agent of Cagnes&mdash;Well, let us take the
evidence. He dined with a Commodore Jasen at the Ch&acirc;teau
d'Antibes, where he had business for his master, Lord Wyndham,
the owner of the place. He departs, bearing valuables, driving
his own car. Very well. He is seen driving through Juan, he
speaks to acquaintances in the Majestic Bar at Cagnes, he is seen
to board the train for Marseilles, and his car is left outside
the station, according to a previous arrangement, and garaged by
a friend. He arrives at the H&ocirc;tel Splendide in Marseilles,
where he is known. He engages a room and leaves orders that he is
to be called an hour before the <i>Narkunda</i> from London docks
sails. He follows the very bad habit which so many travellers
have of dining at a restaurant in Marseilles, instead of in the
hotel, and there I think he makes a great mistake. He has a large
quantity of valuable jewellery with him to deliver to Lord
Wyndham on the <i>Narkunda</i> the following morning, yet he
chooses to go out to spend the evening in Marseilles, and
apparently takes the jewellery with him. He is seen to enter a
taxicab at eight o'clock, and he asks to be driven to the Cintra
Bar. He pays the man off there and disappears. I cannot believe,
my friend, that your very astute detectives have not been able to
collect some further information of the man who entered the
Cintra Bar, at ten minutes past eight last Friday week, and has
not been heard of since."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, it is so," the Chef de la S&ucirc;ret&eacute;
announced. "My best men are on the case. We are inundated with
false information but nothing leads us to the truth. If I were to
presume to offer my advice, Monsieur Lavalon, to a man of your
genius and distinction, it would sound strangely, but I shall
offer it none the less."</p>

<p>"I shall listen with respect," Monsieur Lavalon promised.</p>

<p>"You can do no good here," the Chef de la S&ucirc;ret&eacute;
said bluntly. "My local men have hold of every possible clue. If
Crowhurst let himself be decoyed into any of the worst of our
night haunts here, then the jewels are probably lost and
Crowhurst no longer lives, but a thing like that is not so easy.
If I were you, Monsieur Lavalon, seeing the impasse we have
arrived at here, I would start at the other end."</p>

<p>"The other end?" Lavalon repeated.</p>

<p>The Chef de la S&ucirc;ret&eacute; twirled his moustache
fiercely.</p>

<p>"I would start at the place and the hour," he declared, "when
Jonathan Crowhurst left his offices in the Rue du Cannot at
Cagnes, with his dressing case and despatch box, in his two-
seater Chrysler, and drove out to the Ch&acirc;teau d'Antibes to
dine with Lord Wyndham's tenant, and execute his mission."</p>

<p>"And what good would that do?" Lavalon demanded.</p>

<p>The Chef de la S&ucirc;ret&eacute; shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"One might have as much chance of discovering the truth," he
said, "as by playing about in the noisome places of
Marseilles."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">"I AM very honoured," Commodore Jasen said, as
he stepped off his motor launch, one afternoon about a fortnight
after the disappearance of Jonathan Crowhurst, and found Caroline
waiting at his private dock. "You are in garden-party attire, I
see, or I would invite you to cruise for an hour with me."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I should love it," she assured him, "but my clothes are too
thin. Besides, your engines are too noisy for conversation and I
want to talk to you."</p>

<p>"I am flattered," he murmured.</p>

<p>"I am not sure that you will be," she confided.</p>

<p>They climbed the broad but winding path that led to the
Ch&acirc;teau. On the lawn before the terrace Caroline pointed to
two very comfortable wicker chairs.</p>

<p>"We will sit here," she proposed. "I don't like the interior
of your house very much or your servants. Your butler&mdash;Jake
Arnott, all remind me of the things I want to forget. By-the-by,
where is Jake Arnott?"</p>

<p>"He has gone to England to visit some relatives," the
Commodore replied.</p>

<p>"You have seen the papers this morning?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I have glanced at them," he admitted. "I see that one young
lady admits to having spent the evening with our missing
friend."</p>

<p>Caroline nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"That may be true," she remarked. "I hope it is."</p>

<p>"Why should it not be?"</p>

<p>Caroline made no reply.</p>

<p>"I came here to tell you something," she continued. "I am
going to marry."</p>

<p>"You are going to marry me?"</p>

<p>"Is there any girl in the world," she asked scornfully, "who
would marry the man who deliberately murdered her brother?"</p>

<p>The Commodore tapped a cigarette upon the arm of his wicker
chair.</p>

<p>"The vocabulary of you women needs amending," he complained.
"That word 'murder,' for instance. How absurd! Ned knew very well
that if he came into my territory, the only question was which
got the other first. I got him and that was the end of it. He
knew the rules of the game and he chose to take his risk. I did
not want to quarrel with him. I would rather we had all worked
together. I hope you don't altogether forget, Caroline, that
night at the Ambassadeurs when I asked you to be my wife? You
have never given me an answer."</p>

<p>"You have it now, then," she pronounced. "The answer is
NO."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen smoked on in silence for several moments. He
might have received the blow of his life, but he gave no sign of
it.</p>

<p>"It is your intention, I gather," he observed, "to cross the
line."</p>

<p>"I have never really left my side of it," she told him. "I am
going to marry amongst my own people."</p>

<p>He flicked the ash from his cigarette.</p>

<p>"When I left New York," he said, "I was worth a million
dollars. I have made that into a million pounds sterling. Taking
every one of my adventures, probing it, analysing it, regarding
it from every point of view, it has been artistically perfect.
Not one of them contains a flaw. I shared a bottle of wine with
two of Headquarters' most famous detectives when I embarked for
Monaco. They knew me as Commodore Jasen and nobody else has ever
known me for any one else. Even little Brant here, though he has
been tortured with suspicions, has never been able to connect me
in the slightest degree with any one of my exploits. I am safe
now, as I shall be safe for the rest of my life. I am wealthy and
I have made an offer to purchase this Ch&acirc;teau. You know all
my weaknesses as well as my better qualities. You know very well
that women have never attracted me in the least. You are the only
woman I have ever asked to marry me. I ask you now once again.
You can live where you like and how you like, and the book of the
past is closed. I am content with my r&ocirc;le as Commodore
Jasen. It may seem to the world that I grow a little younger, for
I have tried to look like fifty-eight when I am really only
forty-eight. That will be the only change in me."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"You are a very remarkable man," she admitted, "but to me you
mean nothing. There was a period&mdash;a few years of my
life&mdash;when I thought such adventures as you and Ned used to
talk of were marvellous. That time has passed. I loathe the very
thought of it."</p>

<p>"You are going to marry the Marquis de St. V&eacute;ran?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I am," she assented. "And I warn you that many things will
happen if you attempt to interfere."</p>

<p>"A threat?" he murmured.</p>

<p>"Only a threat in case of a threat," she rejoined.</p>

<p>He remained silent for so long that she rose at last to her
feet. He followed suit.</p>

<p>"You walked over here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I walked," she told him. "It is a very short distance across
the rocks."</p>

<p>"You will permit me to order a car or to send you back by the
boat?" he suggested.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Armand is fishing on the rocks," she explained. "Perfectly
ridiculous, but it amuses him. You have nothing to say to
me?"</p>

<p>"It will keep," he answered.</p>

<p>Even then she hesitated, and before she spoke her last words,
she looked cautiously around as though she feared listeners.</p>

<p>"This afternoon," she told him, "Lavalon, the French
detective, arrived here from Marseilles. Brant and the local
Commissaire met him. They are all together in the hotel now."</p>

<p>"A whimsical fellow, Lavalon," he murmured, as he held open
the gate.</p>

<p>The Marquis abandoned his fishing enterprise with alacrity on
Caroline's arrival. He was inclined to be peevish.</p>

<p>"There has been a small man," he
complained&mdash;"American&mdash;not a pleasant man. He
interfered with my fishing to ask questions about Commodore
Jasen. He even mentioned your name. I showed him over which rocks
to escape. He annoyed me."</p>

<p>"What sort of questions did he ask?"</p>

<p>"Whether you had known Commodore Jasen in New York. Where you
had met him."</p>

<p>"And what did you tell him?"</p>

<p>"I tell him to mind his own affairs. I show him the way over
the rocks. I should have helped him, but he hurried."</p>

<p>Caroline laughed.</p>

<p>"A newspaper man, I expect," she observed. "They are rather
wearisome people."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she wondered.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">CAROLINE and Armand de St. V&eacute;ran dined
alone that night, in Paradise&mdash;or what was so near to it
that it really did not matter. Their table at the Eden Roc
overhung the deep diving pool, in the waters of which the
searchlight, arranged by amateur fishermen, disclosed white-
bellied fish, loup and mostelle, darting eagerly towards the
unusual illumination. In the distance was the black, whalelike
shape of the island. The near hills were dotted with the lights
of the villas, ugly enough by day, the possible habitation of
fairies by night. Palm Beach had its little frieze of golden pin
pricks and its mystic summons. Only twenty minutes across the
bay, and such a welcome at the long, squat Casino for the visitor
with the thin cheque book or the fat <i>portemonnaie</i>. And
behind, brooding over the world of vanities and night-lived
passions, the curses and joys of the gaming rooms, the slumbers
of the just in those hillside villas, and the fierce unrest of
the gamblers in the crowded gaming rooms, the marvellous
Esterels, blue and grey against a violet background, the zigzag
outline cutting into the eternal sweetness beyond....</p>

<p>"This is a foretaste of heaven," the Marquis murmured.</p>

<p>"Except that I hope the music will be different," Caroline
sighed. "I think I shall prefer the harp and cymbal to the
saxophone."</p>

<p>"And I," her companion declared, "would welcome any form of
angel at the next table rather than the little&mdash;how is it,
you call him?&mdash;bounder who was asking impertinent questions
of me this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Is he here?" Caroline enquired quickly.</p>

<p>"Next&mdash;to your left. Alone naturally. He disports a too
small black tie and a shirt which leaps from his waistcoat. He
does not please me at all, that little man. He has the face of a
hungry ferret."</p>

<p>Caroline turned her head. Her premonition had been correct. It
was Brant, the American detective.</p>

<p>"You know who he is?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"I will tell you presently."</p>

<p>Then a uniformed page boy paused at the table. He addressed
Caroline.</p>

<p>"One desires Mademoiselle on the telephone," he announced.</p>

<p>"Down here?"</p>

<p>"The connection is made, Mademoiselle."</p>

<p>The Marquis rose gallantly to his feet. Caroline crossed the
floor, followed by many greetings from friends and acquaintances,
and many admiring glances. She took up the receiver. The
attendant closed the door.</p>

<p>"This is Caroline Loyd speaking," she said.</p>

<p>The answer came at once. Commodore Jasen's voice, but barely
recognisable.</p>

<p>"Jasen speaking. Are you alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You have heard the news?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Body of Jonathan Crowhurst&mdash;the missing man, you
know&mdash;has been found."</p>

<p>"At Marseilles?"</p>

<p>"Washed up at Golfe Juan. Miracles, it seems, happen in the
Mediterranean. That fellow Brant thinks he has it over me now.
The place is surrounded. Brant is on the terrace at the present
moment, waiting for the bell to be answered."</p>

<p>"What can I do?" Caroline asked.</p>

<p>"Bring a car by the Antibes shore road to the Garoupe by-way.
You can reach the dock from there. I can come down the
underground passage and will meet you. If your friend, the
Marquis, is there, bring him along. I shall need help."</p>

<p>"You are really leaving?"</p>

<p>"If I can get to the boat."</p>

<p>"Listen," she insisted. "You tell me that Brant is there on
the terrace."</p>

<p>"He has just rung the bell himself. He has been about here all
the evening."</p>

<p>"That seems queer," Caroline remarked calmly.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because he is at the present moment dining at the next table
to mine. I left him there, when I came to answer the telephone.
He seems to have been dividing his attention for the last hour
between his dinner, my companion and myself."</p>

<p>There was a blank silence. Then Jasen's voice&mdash;not by any
means a pleasant sound to listen to.</p>

<p>"What am I to say to such an unforeseen piece of bad luck?
Perhaps it is better to say nothing. As I cannot induce you then
to come to me, I must come to you."</p>

<p>"But what do you want?" she demanded. "All that can usefully
be said is said."</p>

<p>"Then, believe me, there is a postscript," the Commodore
mocked,&mdash;"a very important postscript. <i>&Agrave;
bient&ocirc;t!</i>"</p>

<p>There was once more blankness. The Commodore had rung off.
Caroline crossed the floor of the restaurant with unseeing eyes.
Fear had come to her. Not only for herself. The Marquis leaned
across the table towards her.</p>

<p>"Nothing disconcerting, I hope?" he asked anxiously. "You have
lost your colour, dear Caroline."</p>

<p>Her eyes met his, those rather deep-set grey-blue eyes which
looked out upon life now so steadily, and which seemed always to
carry for her the one entrancing message.</p>

<p>"Yes," she admitted, "my message was very disconcerting."</p>

<p>"May I share your disquietude, or relieve it?" he begged.</p>

<p>"You shall share it, at any rate," she promised. "I told you
that there was one person whom I dreaded telling of my intention
to marry you."</p>

<p>"Something you did say like that," he acknowledged. "But you
told me other things which were all I wanted to know, and indeed,
dearest," he went on, his voice sinking almost to a whisper, "if
you had not been able to tell me those other things, I should
still have been content, because whatever was in your life before
is as nothing."</p>

<p>Every one flirted openly at Eden Roc and there was nothing at
all unusual in the touch of their fingers. Only a good many
people envied her, for Armand de St. V&eacute;ran in these days
was a gallant figure of a man.</p>

<p>"There is a seal upon my lips," she confided, "as to certain
things, but that seal means nothing dishonourable. I can tell
you, however, the name of the man I fear, because I am convinced
that, unless we are sensible and leave this country, you will
soon know. It is Commodore Jasen."</p>

<p>He looked at her in amazement.</p>

<p>"Why, that nice benevolent-looking gentleman over at the
Ch&acirc;teau!" he exclaimed. "I thought he was your friend. I
was looking forward to his congratulations."</p>

<p>"Commodore Jasen," she said, "is no man's friend. The personal
things between us are slight. He once asked me to marry him. I
perhaps lingered for a long time before I gave him my reply. When
I gave it to him it was 'no.' Since then I have learned what
manner of man he is. What I half admired once as courage I have
learned to be ferocity. What I took for firmness I know now to be
cruelty. You speak of him as benevolent. Armand, he is a devil.
Just now he did his best to trick me&mdash;you too&mdash;up to
the Ch&acirc;teau. I found out that he was not telling the truth.
He only laughed and he is on his way here now."</p>

<p>"It may be as well," Armand de St. V&eacute;ran remarked. "He
shall be given to understand, if he has annoyed or threatened
you, that you have a protector."</p>

<p>"He is outside that sort of thing," she sighed. "Armand, if
you and I value very highly our lives, we should be wise indeed
if we left the table now&mdash;if you brought your car out of the
garage, and if we rode on till morning&mdash;never mind
where&mdash;north, east, south or west&mdash;anywhere out of
reach of that man!"</p>

<p>"My dear, you are hysterical!" he declared. "One man is only
one man. I am not a stripling."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are brave enough, I know that," she admitted. "But
you don't understand fighting as Jasen understands it. A snap of
the fingers, the flash of a torch and a bullet. He does not wait
for the other man. He is not a fighter. He is a killer."</p>

<p>"That sounds very unpleasant," the Marquis said gravely. "In
that case, one must make sure that it is he who is killed."</p>

<p>"How can you do that?" she asked feverishly. "You are not like
these devils of men. You have no ugly pocket with a loaded weapon
ready to your fingers."</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"I have not," he acknowledged. "But this is scarcely the scene
for exploits such as you describe. I do not think that our mild-
looking little friend will prance in here, dealing out murder and
sudden death. You are too pale, dear Caroline. All through dinner
time I have been dying to dance with you in that amazing rose-
coloured frock. I think that our time has come. It is a
waltz."</p>

<p>They danced under the tented roof, in a darkness relieved only
by a few shaded lamps and the long pathway of moonlight upon the
water&mdash;not so clearly defined now, for in the background
dark clouds were rolling up and a storm was brewing. And
sometimes Caroline forgot and was curiously happy, and sometimes
there was a little stab at her heart, and fear came into her eyes
as she watched the stairway. Yet when the man whom she feared
arrived, he arrived unnoticed. She heard his voice talking to a
group of friends and, but for her partner's protecting arm, would
have fallen.</p>

<p>"Shall we sit down now?" she begged.</p>

<p>He smiled at her indulgently, but acquiesced, leading her back
towards the table. His smile now might seem to have been
justified, for nothing in the atmosphere of any part of the room
even dimly suggested the imminence of tragedy. The Commodore had
been detained by a group of gay diners a few yards away. Never
had his smile been more benevolent, his laughter more infectious.
The fingers of one lady were pressed audaciously to his lips,
whilst he whispered what appeared to be a very amusing story in
the ears of another. He waved his hand to Caroline as she passed,
but made no immediate move. The Marquis smiled as he drew out her
chair.</p>

<p>"You see for yourself, my dear," he began&mdash;</p>

<p>Then he broke off in his speech. The Commodore had a habit of
moving noiselessly, of turning up in unexpected places. A moment
ago his soft laugh, his lowered voice were clearly audible as
they had passed within a few feet of him. They looked up and
there he was, leaning almost between them at the end of their
table, a speechless&mdash;a strangely dumb person. As a last
desperate resource, Caroline turned her head towards where the
little man had been seated. The table was deserted, the napkin
thrown down. Brant had finished his meal and departed.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down, sir?" the Marquis invited
courteously.</p>

<p>"I fear to intrude," was the quiet reply. "Besides, in affairs
such as the one I am about to deal with, I am more at my ease
standing up."</p>

<p>The Marquis raised his eyebrows. Certainly this man talked
strangely. There were no signs either of the geniality and good
humour which had been flowing from his lips during his progress
through the room. His face was hard and set. The long upper lip
seemed to have escaped the concealment of the moustache and to be
drawn tightly down.</p>

<p>"We should like to ask you to have a glass of wine with us,"
de St. V&eacute;ran ventured politely.</p>

<p>"To drink wine out of the same bottle," Commodore Jasen
observed, "is supposed to indicate a certain amount of good-
feeling and good-fellowship. Between you and me nothing of that
sort can possibly exist. In fact, within the next few
minutes&mdash;or seconds perhaps&mdash;I propose to kill
you."</p>

<p>The Marquis set down the glass which he had been in the act of
raising to his lips. After all, then, Caroline was right. This
man was either mad or a desperate criminal. The position was
equally unpleasant in either case.</p>

<p>"This seems to me to be rather a poor joke," he said coldly.
"Can't you see that you are alarming Miss Loyd?"</p>

<p>"Miss Loyd is alarmed," the Commodore confided, "because she
knows that I always keep my word. You are wondering, perhaps, how
I am going to do it. You see my right hand?"</p>

<p>The Marquis nodded. He saw the fingers moving, but he showed
no signs of trepidation. Nevertheless, he seemed to be taking
into account his chances. His eyes measured the distance between
the Commodore and himself. Jasen smiled.</p>

<p>"No hope," he observed. "Perhaps if I had sat down&mdash;you
have long arms, I see&mdash;but very wisely I preferred to remain
where I am. You see that my right hand is holding something in my
jacket pocket? It is holding the butt of a small weapon with
which I have never missed in my life. I prefer to shoot in this
way. I have your heart covered to within an inch. A move on your
part would be unfortunate."</p>

<p>"Don't move," Caroline whispered frantically. "He tells the
truth. He never misses."</p>

<p>"But why does he want to kill me?" the Marquis demanded. "If I
am to fight a duel for you, I am agreeable, but murder! Surely
murder does not enter into any possible scheme of things."</p>

<p>"An ugly word," Jasen objected. "Killing is the logical
resource of any man, when something stands in his way which can
only be removed by extinction. Killing is the weapon which has
freed countries from slavery all over the world."</p>

<p>"Do sit down and let me order another bottle of wine, if you
are going to be didactic," the Marquis said coolly. "We can do
our killing later."</p>

<p>Commodore Jasen turned his hard, set eyes upon the
speaker.</p>

<p>"Your attitude pleases me," he said. "It is a pity we did not
meet earlier in life. You would have been a welcome addition to
my little band of helpers."</p>

<p>"Can you say anything to bring this man to his senses?" de St.
V&eacute;ran asked across the table.</p>

<p>Caroline shook her head. During the last few minutes shadows
had formed under her eyes. She was ghastly pale. Her fingers
trembled. She was almost beginning to long for even the worst to
happen. Anything was better than this cold duel of words between
the man who, she knew, meant murder, and his victim. Suddenly she
felt a rush of courage. The Marquis's complete nonchalance, the
kindly light in his enquiring eyes, his questioning smile
inspired her. The thing couldn't happen. That silly little bulge
in the Commodore's pocket might mean anything, but not that.</p>

<p>"For the first time in his life," she said, "Commodore Jasen
is talking like a fool. He loves adventure, and he has been
utterly spoilt in life because he has been always successful, and
he has generally had his own way. This time he cannot have his
own way. If he does what he threatens, he knows perfectly well
what will happen to him. He is boxed in here like a rat in a
corner."</p>

<p>"Common sense, my dear," the Commodore admitted. "That's why I
tried to get you to come down on to the dock to me. Things would
have been much easier then. This may possibly turn out to be more
dramatic. The end is the same, anyhow. You are both going to
die."</p>

<p>"But what about yourself afterwards?" Caroline asked, looking
appealingly at him, struggling frantically to keep the new light
of hope from her eyes, to command and restrain this new set of
emotions. "What about you? You won't be able to escape."</p>

<p>The Commodore sighed.</p>

<p>"I might," he reflected. "On the other hand, you are probably
right. I may have to&mdash;disappear. You would not believe,
however," he went on, "how calmly I can face the worst, when I
think that you two will precede my passage into eternity by a few
seconds."</p>

<p>"Listen," she begged frantically.</p>

<p>"I have always been willing to listen to you," Commodore Jasen
said reproachfully, "but you are trying me high. Some one might
come up and join in our conversation."</p>

<p>"I will keep them away," she whispered. "There is something I
must say: something to which you must listen. It might&mdash;make
a difference."</p>

<p>Then she spoke appalling words.</p>

<p>"Supposing I gave up Armand?"</p>

<p>The Commodore affected to consider the situation. The bulge in
his jacket pocket, however, did not diminish. He was enjoying
these last few minutes on earth. He must be careful, though, he
told himself, not to delay too long.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," he began regretfully&mdash;</p>

<p>Events during the next few seconds seemed to happen without
sequence or continuity. The little man whose behaviour, in the
shadows of the room, Caroline had been watching with mingled hope
and amazement, until she dared look no longer, suddenly lifted a
pile of plates over his head and sent them crashing to the floor,
barely a yard behind their table. Commodore Jasen's nerves were
fairly impervious to this sort of thing, but his left hand for a
single second lost its tensity. He pulled the trigger of his
revolver, all right, but his arm was already jerked upwards from
behind by one of the tall figures who had been waiting for
Brant's signal. Two bullets travelled harmlessly out into the
darkness, just as Caroline practically threw herself upon him,
and her companion's fist crashed into his face. Commodore Jasen,
fighting like a wild-cat, went crashing into the next
table&mdash;one of his arms, which he had managed to free,
striking flail-like and terrible blows at every one within reach.
Once he very nearly reached the Marquis, who stood waiting for
him. Then there was a sudden rush from the other end of the room,
a medley of confused, angry and questioning cries.</p>

<p>"What the mischief are they doing to the old Commodore?" Major
Darnell, the leader of the young set, called out. "Come on,
lads."</p>

<p>In less than a minute the whole place was in worse confusion
than ever. The women ran screaming to a distant corner. Brant was
a prisoner in the arms of half-a-dozen assailants. Three or four
men were on their knees, bending over a tangled heap of
struggling humanity in the middle of the place. Brant at last
made himself heard.</p>

<p>"Listen, you fools!" he cried. "Your Commodore Jasen is a
murderer, an international criminal&mdash;the murderer of
Jonathan Crowhurst not ten days ago. We are detectives. Don't let
him go."</p>

<p>There was a slackening in the struggle, but a good deal of
disbelief.</p>

<p>"Don't talk rot," Darnell shouted. "Old Jasen! He's one of the
best sorts going. Where are you, sir?"</p>

<p>He might well ask. One or two of them thought they saw a man
crouching low, running with flying footsteps down into the bar,
but no one was sure. By degrees every one had stumbled to their
feet. One of the gendarmes had a broken leg. Brant himself was
bleeding freely from a cut on the cheek. The young men, most of
them Englishmen, who had led the assault, were beginning to look
somewhat foolish. Brant dashed towards the stairway.</p>

<p>"Come on, any of you who can stand up," he cried.</p>

<p>They went streaming down into the bar lounge. At the far end,
the doorkeeper lay groaning on the ground.</p>

<p>"He's mad," he faltered. "It was the Commodore, running like a
madman. He shot me through the shoulder when I tried to stop
him."</p>

<p>"Where is he now?" some one cried out.</p>

<p>"Gone down to the beach," the man gasped, and rolled over.</p>

<p>From the small harbourage given over to fishing craft, there
came the beating of a powerful engine. Commodore Jasen's famous
motor boat shot out from the shadows. Caroline, clinging
desperately to her lover's arm, leaned over the side of the
balustrade jutting out from the restaurant. She pointed to the
bay.</p>

<p>"He's got away from them all," she cried. "The man is a
devil."</p>

<p>The motor boat, with roaring engines, rushed into full sight.
People, recovering a little from their alarm, leaned from every
point of vantage to watch it. Already motor cars were on the way
to the Ch&acirc;teau, but it appeared that Commodore Jasen had no
idea of returning home. He shot past the point of the Mosque
without wavering. Just then the moon temporarily escaped from the
banks of dark clouds which had risen during the last half hour
and threw a faint illumination upon the scene. They could see the
man at the wheel leaning forwards, the bow well out of the water,
a huge wake of churned-up sea in the rear. Jasen was momentarily
invisible, apparently stooping down. Presently they saw him rise
and throw himself backwards into one of the most comfortable
easy-chairs. The boat was heading straight for a bank of black
clouds.</p>

<p>"He's going right into the storm," some one muttered.</p>

<p>The sheet lightning showed both men in their places, the
mechanic bending lower still, to avoid the sting of the flying
spray. Commodore Jasen, however, had the air of one who was at
peace with the world. He was lying back amongst the cushions, a
cigar in his mouth, embarked on that brief voyage towards
eternity, looking very much the same as when he had escorted a
party of ladies to picnic upon the islands.</p>
