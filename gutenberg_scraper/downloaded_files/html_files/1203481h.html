<h2>INTRODUCTION&mdash;THE COMPACT</h2>
<h3>First published in <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, Nov 1920</h3>
<p class="first">The wind, storming up from the sea, beat against
the frail little wooden building till every rafter creaked and
groaned. The canvas sides flapped and strained madly at the
imprisoning ropes. Those hanging lamps which were not already
extinguished swung in perilous arcs. In the auditorium of the
frail little temporary theatre, only one man lingered near the
entrance, and he, as we well knew, with sinister purpose. In the
little make-up room behind the stage, we three performers, shorn
of our mummer's disguise, presented perhaps the most melancholy
spectacle of all. The worst of it was that Leonard and I were all
broken up with trying to make the best of<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> the
situation for Rose's sake, yet prevented by circumstances from
altogether ignoring it.</p>
<p>"Seems to me we're in rather a tightish corner, Leonard," I
ventured, watching that grim figure in the doorway through a hole
in the curtain.</p>
<p>"First turn to the left off Queer Street," Leonard admitted
gloomily.</p>
<p>Rose said nothing. She was seated in the one chair which went
with the portable property, and her head had fallen forward upon
her arms, which were stretched upon the deal table. Her hat, a
poor little woollen tam-o'-shanter, was pushed back from her
head. Her jacket was unfastened. The rain beat down upon the tin
roof.</p>
<p>"I'd sell my soul for a whisky and soda," Leonard, our
erstwhile humourist, declared wistfully.</p>
<p>"And I mine," I echoed, thinking of Rose, "for a good supper,
a warm fire and a comfortable bed."</p>
<p>"And I mine," Rose faltered, looking up and dabbing at her
eyes with a morsel of handkerchief, "for a cigarette."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg
5]</a></span>There was a clap of thunder. The flap of canvas
which led to the back of the stage shook as though the whole
place were coming down. We looked up apprehensively and found
that we were no longer alone. A clean-shaven man of medium
height, dressed in a long mackintosh and carrying a tweed cap in
his hand, had succeeded in effecting a difficult entrance. His
appearance, even at that time, puzzled us. His face was perfectly
smooth, he was inclined to be bald, his eyes were unusually
bright, and there was a noticeable curve at the corners of his
lips which might have meant either humour or malevolence. We had
no idea what to make of him. One thing was certain, however,--he
was not the man an interview with whom we were dreading.</p>
<p>"Mephistopheles himself could scarcely have made a more
opportune entrance," he remarked, as the crash of thunder
subsided into a distant mutter. "Permit me."</p>
<p>He crossed towards us with a courteous little bow and extended
a gold cigarette case, amply filled. Rose took one without
hesita<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg
6]</a></span>tion and lit it. We also helped ourselves. The
newcomer replaced the case in his pocket.</p>
<p>"I will take the liberty," he continued, "of introducing
myself. My name is Richard Thomson."</p>
<p>"A very excellent name," Leonard murmured.</p>
<p>"A more than excellent cigarette," I echoed.</p>
<p>"You are the gentleman who sat in the three-shilling seats,"
Rose remarked, looking at him curiously.</p>
<p>Mr. Richard Thomson bowed.</p>
<p>"I was there last night and the night before," he
acknowledged. "On each occasion I found with regret that I was
alone."</p>
<p>No one likes to be reminded of failure. I answered a little
hastily.</p>
<p>"You have established your position, sir, as a patron of our
ill-omened enterprise. May I ask to what we are indebted for the
honour of this visit?"</p>
<p>"In the first place, to invite you all to supper," was the
brisk reply. "Secondly, to ask if I can be of any service in
helping you to get rid of that bearded rascal Drummond,
whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg
7]</a></span> I see hanging about at the entrance. And in the
third place--but I think," he added, after a queer and oddly
prolonged pause, "that we might leave that till afterwards."</p>
<p>I stared at him like a booby, for I was never a believer in
miracles. The quiver on Rose's lips was almost pathetic, for like
all sweet-natured women she was an optimist to the last degree.
Leonard, I could see, shared my incredulity. The thing didn't
seem possible, for although he was obviously a man of means, and
although his manner was convincing and there was a smile upon his
lips, Mr. Richard Thomson did not look in the least like a
philanthropist.</p>
<p>"Come, come," the latter continued, "mine is a serious offer.
Are you afraid that I shall need payment for my help and
hospitality? What more could you have to give than the souls you
proffered so freely as I came in?"</p>
<p>"You can have mine," Leonard assured him hastily.</p>
<p>"Mine also is at your service," I told him. "The only trouble
seems to be to reduce it to a negotiable medium."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg
8]</a></span>"We will make that a subject of discussion later
on," our new friend declared. "Mr. Lister," he added, turning to
me, "may I take it for granted that you are the business head of
this enterprise? How do you stand?"</p>
<p>I choked down the pitiful remnants of my pride and answered
him frankly.</p>
<p>"We are in the worst plight three human beings could possibly
find themselves in. We've played here for six nights, and we
haven't taken enough money to pay for the lighting. We owe the
bill at our lodgings, we haven't a scrap of food, a scrap of
drink, a scrap of tobacco, a scrap of credit. We've nothing to
pawn, and Drummond outside wants four pounds."</p>
<p>"That settles it," our visitor declared curtly. "Follow
me."</p>
<p>We obeyed him dumbly. It is my belief that we should have
obeyed any one helplessly at that moment, whether they had
ordered us to set fire to the place or to stand on our heads. We
saw Drummond go off into the darkness, gripping in his hand
unexpected money, and followed our guide across the windy
space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg
9]</a></span> which led to the brilliantly lit front of the Grand
Hotel, whose luxurious portals we passed for the first time. We
had a tangled impression of bowing servants, an amiable lift man,
a short walk along a carpeted corridor, a door thrown open, a
comfortable sitting room and a blazing fire, a round table laid
for four, a sideboard set out with food, and gold-foiled bottles
of champagne. A waiter bustled in after us and set down a tureen
of smoking hot soup.</p>
<p>"You needn't wait," our host ordered, taking off his
mackintosh and straightening his black evening bow in the glass.
"Miss Mindel, allow me to take your jacket. Sit on this side of
the table, near the fire; you there, Cotton, and you opposite me,
Lister. We will just start the proceedings so," he went on,
cutting the wires of a bottle of champagne and pouring out its
contents. "A little soup first, eh, and then I'll carve. Miss
Mindel--gentlemen--your very good health. I drink to our better
acquaintance."</p>
<p>Rose's hand shook and I could see that she was on the verge of
tears. It is my belief that<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> nothing but our host's
matter-of-fact manner saved her at that moment from a breakdown.
Leonard and I, too, made our poor little efforts at unsentimental
cheerfulness.</p>
<p>"If this is hell," the former declared, eyeing the chickens
hungrily, "I'm through with earth."</p>
<p>"Drink your wine, Rose," I advised, raising my own glass, "and
remember the mummers' philosophy."</p>
<p>Rose wiped away the tears, emptied her glass of champagne and
smiled.</p>
<p>"Nothing in the world," she declared fervently, "ever smelt or
tasted so good as this soup."</p>
<p>The psychological effect of food, wine, warmth and tobacco
upon three gently nurtured but half-starved human beings became
even more evident at a later stage in the evening. Its immediate
manifestations, however, were little short of remarkable. For my
part, I forgot entirely the agony of the last few weeks, and
realised once more with complacent optimism the adventurous
possibilities of our vagabond life. Leonard, with flushed
cheeks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg
11]</a></span> a many times refilled glass, and a big cigar in
the corner of his mouth, had without the slightest doubt
completely forgotten the misery of having to try and be funny on
an empty stomach to an insufficient audience. With a little
colour in her cheeks, a smile once more upon her lips, and a
sparkle in her grey eyes, Rose was once more herself, the most
desirable and attractive young woman in the world as, alas! both
Leonard and I had discovered. The only person who remained
unmoved, either by the bounty he was dispensing or by the wine
and food of which he also partook, was the giver of the feast.
Sphinxlike, at times almost saturnine looking, his eyes taking
frequent and restless note of us, his mouth, with its queer
upward curve, a constant puzzle, he remained as mysterious a
benefactor when the meal was finished as when he had made his
ominous appearance behind the stage at the framework theatre. He
was an attentive although a silent host. It was never apparent
that his thoughts were elsewhere, and I, watching him more
closely, perhaps, than the other two, realised<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> that
most of the time he was living in a world of his own, in which we
three guests were very small puppets indeed.</p>
<p>Cigars were lit, chairs were drawn around the fire, Rose was
installed on a superlatively comfortable couch, with a box of
cigarettes at her elbow, and her favourite liqueur, untasted for
many weeks, at her side.</p>
<p>"Let me try your wits," our host proposed, a little abruptly.
"Tell me your life history in as few words as possible. Mr.
Lister? Tabloid form, if you please?"</p>
<p>"Clergyman's son, without a shilling in the family," I
replied; "straight from the 'Varsity, where I had meant to work
hard for a degree, to the Army, where after three and a half
years of it I lost this,"--touching my empty left coat sleeve.
"Tried six months for a job, without success. Heard of a chap who
had made a concert party pay, realised that my only gifts were a
decent voice and some idea of dancing, so had a shot at it
myself."</p>
<p>"Mr. Cotton?"</p>
<p>"Idle and dissolute son of a wine merchant at Barnstaple who
failed during the war,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13"
id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> Leonard expounded; "drifted into
this sort of thing because I'd made some small successes locally
and didn't want to be a clerk."</p>
<p>"Miss Mindel?"</p>
<p>The girl shook her head.</p>
<p>"I am quite alone in the world," she said. "My mother taught
music at Torquay and she died quite suddenly. I put my name down
for a concert party, and in a way I was very fortunate," she
added, glancing sweetly at Leonard and at me. "These two men have
been so dear to me and I don't think it's any one's fault that
we're such a failure. The weather's been bad, and people stay in
their hotels and dance all the time now."</p>
<p>She held out a hand to each of us. She knew perfectly well how
we both felt, and she treated us always just like that, as though
she understood and realised the compact which Leonard and I had
made. So we sat, linked together, as it were, while our host
studied us thoughtfully, appreciating, without a doubt, our air
of somewhat nervous expectancy. A fine sense of psychology guided
him to the conviction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id=
"Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> that we were in a properly receptive
state of mind. The smile which had first puzzled us played once
more upon his lips.</p>
<p>"And now," he said, "about those souls!"</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg

<h2>CONUNDRUM #1.&mdash;THE STOLEN MINUTE BOOK</h2>
<h3>First published in <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, Nov 1920</h3>
<p class="first">Rose always insisted that she was psychic, and I
have some faith myself in presentiments. At any rate, we both
declared, on that Monday night before the curtain went up, that
something was going to happen. Leonard had no convictions of the
sort himself but he was favourably disposed towards our attitude.
He put the matter succinctly.</p>
<p>"Here we are," he pointed out, "sold to the devil, body and
soul, and if the old boy doesn't make some use of us, I shall
begin to be afraid the whole thing's coming to an end. Five
pounds a week, and a reserve fund for costumes and posters suits
me very nicely, thank you."</p>
<p>"I don't think you need worry," I told him. "It doesn't seem
reasonable to imagine that we've been sent to the slums of
Liverpool for nothing."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg
16]</a></span>"Then there are those posters," Rose put in,
"offering prizes to amateurs. I'm quite certain there's some
method in that. Besides----"</p>
<p>She hesitated. We both pressed her to go on.</p>
<p>"You'll think this silly, but for the last three nights I've
had a queer sort of feeling that Mr. Thomson was somewhere in the
audience. I can't explain it. I looked everywhere for him. I even
tried looking at the people one by one, all down the rows. I
never saw any one in the least like him. All the same, I expected
to hear his voice at any moment."</p>
<p>"Granted the old boy's Satanic connections," Leonard observed,
"he may appear to us in any form. Brimstone and horns are clean
out of date. He'll probably send his disembodied voice with
instructions."</p>
<p>I strolled to the wings and had a look at the house. Although
it still wanted a quarter of an hour before the performance was
due to commence, the hall was almost packed with people. The
audience, as was natural considering the locality, was a pretty
tough lot. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id=
"Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> seemed to consist chiefly of
stewards and sailors from the great liners which lay in the river
near by, with a sprinkling of operatives and some of the smaller
shopkeepers. The study of faces has always interested me, and
there were two which I picked out from the crowd during that
brief survey and remembered. One was the face of a youngish man,
dressed in the clothes of a labourer and seated in a dark corner
of the room. He was very pale, almost consumptive-looking, with a
black beard which looked as though it had been recently grown,
and coal black hair. His features were utterly unlike the
features of his presumed class, and there was a certain
furtiveness about his expression which puzzled me. A quietly
dressed girl sat by his side, whose face was even more in the
shadow than his, but it struck me that she had been crying, and
that for some reason or other there was a disagreement between
her and the young man. The other person whom I noticed was a
stout, middle-aged man, with curly black hair, a rather yellow
complexion, of distinctly Semitic appearance. His hands were
folded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg
18]</a></span> upon his waistcoat, he was smoking with much
obvious enjoyment a large cigar, and his eyes were half-closed,
as though he were enjoying a brief rest. I put him down as a
small shopkeeper, for choice a seller of ready-made garments, who
had had a long day's work and was giving himself a treat on the
strength of it.</p>
<p>At half-past seven the hall was crammed and the curtain rang
up. We went through the first part of our programme with a
reasonable amount of success, Leonard in particular getting two
encores for one of his humorous songs. At the beginning of the
second part, I came out upon the stage and made the little speech
which our mysterious patron's wishes rendered necessary.</p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," I said, "I have much pleasure in
announcing, according to our posters outside, that if there are
any amateurs here willing to try their luck upon the stage,
either with a song or a dance, we shall be very happy to provide
them with music and any slight change of costume. A prize of one
pound will be given to the performer whose song meets with the
greatest approval, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id=
"Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> a second prize of five shillings for
the next most successful item."</p>
<p>I gagged on for a few more minutes, trying to encourage those
whom I thought likely aspirants, amidst the laughter and cheers
of the audience. Presently a showily dressed young woman threw
aside a cheap fur cloak, displaying a low-cut blue satin gown,
jumped nimbly on to the stage, ignoring my outstretched hand, and
held out a roll of music to Rose, who came smilingly from the
background.</p>
<p>"I'll try 'The Old Folks down Wapping Way', dear," she
announced, "and don't you hurry me when the sloppy stuff comes. I
like to give 'em time for a snivel or two. Sit you down at the
piano. I'm that nervous, I can't stand fussing about here."</p>
<p>They bent over the music together and I turned back to the
audience. There were only two others who showed any disposition
to follow the example of the lady in blue satin. One was the
young man whom I had previously noticed, and who had now risen to
his feet. It was obvious that the girl by his side
was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg
20]</a></span> doing all she could to dissuade him from his
purpose. I could almost hear the sob in her throat as she tried
to drag him back to his place. I myself felt curiously indisposed
to interfere, but Leonard, who was standing by my side, and who
saw them for the first time, imagining that a word of
encouragement was all that was necessary, concluded the
business.</p>
<p>"Come along, sir," he called out. "You look as though you had
a good tenor voice, and nothing fetches 'em like it. You let him
come, my dear, and he'll buy you a new hat with the money."</p>
<p>The young man shook himself free and stepped on to the
platform, obviously ill at ease at the cheer which his enterprise
evoked. He was followed, to my surprise, by the middle-aged man
whom I had previously noticed.</p>
<p>"Here, Mister," was his greeting, as he stepped on to the
platform, "I'll have a go at 'em. Sheeny patter and a clog dance,
eh?"</p>
<p>"You must find me some sort of a change," the young man
insisted hurriedly.</p>
<p>"And I'll tidy up a bit myself," his rival observed. "We'll
let the gal have first go."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg
21]</a></span>I conducted them behind and showed the young man
into the men's dressing room.</p>
<p>"You'll find an old dress suit of mine there," I pointed out.
"Change as quickly as you can. I don't fancy the young lady will
hold them for long."</p>
<p>He nodded and drew me a little on one side. His manner was
distinctly uneasy, and his clothes were shabbier even than they
had seemed at a distance, but his voice was the voice of a person
of education, pleasant, notwithstanding a queer, rather musical
accent which at the moment was unfamiliar to me.</p>
<p>"Shall I be able to lock my things up?" he asked, in an
undertone. "No offence," he went on hastily, "only I happen to be
carrying something rather valuable about with me."</p>
<p>I handed him the key of the dressing room, for which he
thanked me.</p>
<p>"How long will that screeching woman be?" he asked
impatiently.</p>
<p>"You can go on directly she's finished murdering this one," I
promised him. "I don't think they'll stand any more."</p>
<p>He nodded, and I turned back towards<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> where
the other aspirant was standing in the shadow of the wings.</p>
<p>"Now what can I do for you, sir?" I asked. "I don't think you
need to change, do you?"</p>
<p>There was no immediate reply. Suddenly I felt a little shiver,
and I had hard work to keep back the exclamation from my lips. I
knew now that Rose had been right. It was a very wonderful
disguise, but our master had at last appeared. He drew a little
nearer to me. Even then, although I knew that it was Richard
Thomson, I could see nothing but the Jew shopkeeper.</p>
<p>"I shall pretend to make some slight change behind that
screen," he said in a low tone. "Come back here when you've taken
him on the stage. I may want you."</p>
<p>He disappeared behind a screen a few feet away, and I stood
there like a dazed man. From the stage I could still hear the
lusty contralto of the young lady candidate. I heard her finish
her song amidst moderate applause, chiefly contributed by a
little group of her supporters. There was a brief pause. The
young lady obliged with an encore. Then the<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> door
of the men's dressing room opened, was closed and locked. The
young man, looking a little haggard but remarkably handsome, came
towards me, clenching the key in his hand.</p>
<p>"I was a fool to take this on," he confided nervously. "You
are sure my things will be all right in there?"</p>
<p>I pointed to the key in his hand.</p>
<p>"You have every assurance of it," I told him.</p>
<p>He fidgeted about, listening with obvious suffering to the
girl's raucous voice.</p>
<p>"Ever been in the profession?" I enquired.</p>
<p>"Never," was the hasty reply.</p>
<p>"What's your line to-night?"</p>
<p>"Tenor. Your pianist will be able to do what I want. I've
heard her."</p>
<p>"If you win the prize, do you want a job?" I asked, more for
the sake of making conversation than from any real curiosity.</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>"I've other work on."</p>
<p>"Down at the docks?"</p>
<p>"That's of no consequence, is it?" was the<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
somewhat curt reply.--"There, she's finished, thank heavens! Let
me get this over."</p>
<p>I escorted him to the wings. The young lady, amidst a little
volley of good-natured chaff, jumped off the stage and returned
to her friends. Her successor crossed quickly towards Rose, who
was still seated at the piano. I slipped back behind the scenes.
Mr. Richard Thomson was examining the lock of the men's dressing
room.</p>
<p>"He's got the key," I told him.</p>
<p>There was no reply. Then I saw that our patron held something
in his hand made of steel, which glittered in the light of an
electric torch which he had just turned towards the keyhole. A
moment later the door was opened and he disappeared. Out on the
stage, Rose was playing the first chords of a well-known Irish
ballad. Then the young man began to sing, and, notwithstanding my
state of excitement, I found myself listening with something like
awe. The silence in the hall was of itself an extraordinary
tribute to the singer. Shuffling of feet, whispering and coughing
had ceased. I felt myself holding my own breath,<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
listening to those long, sweet notes with their curious,
underlying surge of passion. Then I heard Mr. Thomson's voice in
my ear, curt and brisk.</p>
<p>"You've a telephone somewhere. Where is it?"</p>
<p>"In the passage," I pointed out.</p>
<p>He disappeared and returned just as a roar of applause greeted
the conclusion of the song. The young man hurried in from the
stage. The Jew shopkeeper was seated in the same chair, with his
hands in his pockets and a disconsolate expression upon his face.
Outside, the audience was literally yelling for an encore.</p>
<p>"You'll have to sing again," I told him.</p>
<p>"I don't want to," he declared passionately. "I was a fool to
come."</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" I protested, for the uproar outside was becoming
unbearable. "Listen! They'll have the place down if you
don't."</p>
<p>"I sha'n't go on," his rival competitor grumbled sombrely,
thrusting a cigar into his mouth and feeling in his pockets for a
match. "You've queered my pitch all right. They're<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> all
Irish down in this quarter. You've fairly got 'em by the
throat."</p>
<p>The young man stood still for a moment, listening to the
strange cries which came from the excited audience. Suddenly
inspiration seemed to come to him. His eyes flashed. He turned
away and strode out on to the stage almost with the air of a man
possessed by some holy purpose. I followed him to the wings, and
from there I had a wonderful view of all that happened during the
next few minutes. The young man stood in the middle of the stage,
waved his hand towards Rose, to intimate that he needed no music,
waited for a few more moments with half-closed eyes and a strange
smile upon his face, and commenced to sing. I realised then what
inspiration meant. He sang against his will, carried away by an
all-conquering emotion, sang in Gaelic, a strange, rhythmic
chant, full of deep, sweet notes, but having in it something
almost Oriental in its lack of compass and superficial monotony.
Again the silence was amazing, only this time, as the song went
on, several of the women began to sob, and a dozen or<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> more
men in the audience stood up. Afterwards I knew what that song
meant. It was the Hymn of Revolution, and every line was a
curse.</p>
<p>From my place in the wings I was able to follow better,
perhaps, than any one else in the room, the events of the next
sixty seconds. I saw two policemen push their way along the stone
passage, past the box office and into the back of the hall, led
by a man in plain clothes, a stalwart, determined-looking man
with a look of the hunter in his face. Almost at the same moment
the singer saw them. His song appeared somehow to become
suspended in the air, ceased so abruptly that there seemed
something inhuman in the breaking off of so wonderful a strain.
He stood gazing at the slowly approaching figures like a man
stricken sick and paralysed with fear. Then, without a word, he
left the stage, pushed past me, sprang for the dressing room,
and, turning the key in the lock, disappeared inside. I followed
him for a few yards and then hesitated. Behind, I could hear the
heavy, slowly moving footsteps of the police, making their way
with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg
28]</a></span> difficulty through the crowd, a slight
altercation, the stern voice of the detective in charge. Then,
facing me, the young man emerged from the dressing room, ghastly
pale, shaking the coat in which he had arrived, distraught,
furious, like a man who looks upon madness. Mr. Richard Thomson
leaned back in his chair, his mouth open, his whole attitude
indicative of mingled curiosity and surprise.</p>
<p>"What you break off for like that, young man?" he demanded.
"Have you forgotten the words? You've won the quid all right,
anyway."</p>
<p>"I've been robbed!" the singer called out. "Something has been
stolen from the pocket of this coat!"</p>
<p>"You locked it up yourself," I reminded him, with a sudden
sinking of the heart.</p>
<p>"I don't care!" was the wild reply. "It was there and it is
gone!"</p>
<p>He flung the coat to the ground with a gesture of despair. The
advancing footsteps and voices were louder now. The man in the
plain clothes pushed his way through the<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
wings, beckoned the police to follow and pointed to the young
man.</p>
<p>"The game's up, Mountjoy," he said curtly. "We don't want any
shooting here," he added, as he saw the flash of a revolver in
the other's hand. "I've half a dozen men outside besides these
two."</p>
<p>The trapped man seemed in some measure to recover himself. He
half faced me, and the revolver in his hand was a wicked looking
instrument.</p>
<p>"Some one has been at my clothes," he muttered, his great
black eyes glaring at me. "If I thought that it was you----"</p>
<p>I was incapable of reply, but I imagine that my obviously
dazed condition satisfied him. He turned from me towards where
Mr. Richard Thomson was seated, watching the proceedings with
stupefied interest, breathing heavily with excitement, his mouth
still a little open.</p>
<p>"Or you," the young man added menacingly.</p>
<p>Thomson held out his hands in front of his face.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg
30]</a></span>"You put that up, Mister," he enjoined earnestly.
"If you're in a bit of trouble with the cops, you go through with
it. Don't you get brandishing those things about. I've known 'em
go off sometimes."</p>
<p>The singer's suspicions, if ever he had any, died away. He
tossed the revolver to the officer, who had halted a few yards
away.</p>
<p>"Better take me out the back away," he advised. "There'll be
trouble if the crowd in front gets to know who I am."</p>
<p>The officer clinked a pair of handcuffs on his captive's
wrists with a sigh of satisfaction. They moved off down the
passage. All the time there had been a queer sort of rumble of
voices in front, which might well have been a presage of the
gathering storm. I moved back to the wings just in time to see
the torch thrown. The girl who had been seated with the young
man, suddenly leaped upon a bench. She snatched off her hat and
veil as though afraid that they might impede her voice. A coil of
black hair hung down her back, her face was as white as marble,
but the strength of her voice was wonderful. It rang through the
hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg
31]</a></span> so that there could not have been a person there
who did not hear it.</p>
<p>"You cowards!" she shouted. "You have let him be taken before
your eyes! That was Mountjoy who sang to you--our liberator!
Rescue him! Is there any one here from Donegal?"</p>
<p>Never in my life have I looked upon such a scene. The men came
streaming like animals across the benches and chairs, which they
dashed on one side and destroyed as though they had been paper. I
was just in time to seize Rose and draw her back to the farthest
corner when the sea of human forms broke across the stage. Nobody
took any notice of us. They went for the back way into the
street, shouting strange cries, brandishing sticks and clenched
fists, fighting even one another in their eagerness to be first.
Until they were gone, the tumult was too great for speech. Rose
clung to my arm.</p>
<p>"What does it mean, Maurice?" she asked breathlessly. "Who is
he?"</p>
<p>"I have no idea," I answered, "but I can<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> tell
you one thing. To-night has been our d&eacute;but."</p>
<p>"Talk plain English," Leonard begged. "Remember we had to be
on the stage all the time."</p>
<p>"It means," I explained, "that we've begun our little job as
spokes in the wheel which our friend Mr. Richard Thomson is
turning. You remember the other competitor, a man who never sang
at all, who looked like a Jew fishmonger in his best
clothes?"</p>
<p>"What about him?" Rose demanded.</p>
<p>"He was Mr. Richard Thomson," I told her. "You and I, Leonard,
are simply mugs at making up. It was the most wonderful disguise
I ever saw in my life."</p>
<p>"That accounts for it," she declared, with a little shiver.
"He has been here before, watching. I told you that I felt him
around, without ever recognising him."</p>
<p>"Where is he now?" Leonard asked abruptly.</p>
<p>We searched the place. There was no sign of our patron. Just
as mysteriously as he had come, he had disappeared. The young
lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg
33]</a></span> in blue satin came up and claimed her sovereign.
We went down into the auditorium and inspected the damage.
Finally, as we were on the point of leaving, a smartly dressed
page came in through the back door and handed me a note. It was
dated from the Adelphi Hotel and consisted only of a few
lines:</p>
<br>
<p class="letter">Mr. Richard Thomson presents his compliments
and will be glad to see Miss Mindel, Mr. Lister and Mr. Cotton to
supper to-night at eleven-thirty.</p>
<br>
<p>History repeated itself. When we presented ourselves at the
Adelphi Hotel and enquired for Mr. Richard Thomson, doors seemed
to fly open before us, a reception clerk himself hurried out with
smiles and bows, and conducted us to the lift. We were ushered
into a luxurious sitting room on the first floor and welcomed by
our host, whose carefully donned dinner clothes and generally
well-cared-for appearance revealed gifts which filled me with
amazement.</p>
<p>"This is a very pleasant meeting," Mr. Thomson declared, as he
placed us at the table and gave orders that the wine should
be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg
34]</a></span> opened. "We met last on the east coast, I
remember. I trust that you are finding business better?"</p>
<p>"Business is wonderfully good," I acknowledged.</p>
<p>"We turned away money last week," Leonard announced.</p>
<p>There was something a little unreal about the feast which was
presently served, excellent though it was, and I am quite sure
that we three guests breathed a sigh of relief when at last the
table was cleared and the waiter dismissed. Our host lit a cigar
and leaned back in his high chair. With the passing of that smile
of hospitality from his lips, his face seemed to have grown hard
and unpropitious.</p>
<p>"I trust," he said slowly, "that you are all satisfied with
our arrangement so far?"</p>
<p>"We are more than satisfied," I assured him, trying to infuse
as much gratitude as I could into my tone. "I am thankful to say
that we are able to put by a little every week, too, towards the
capital which you advanced. The new costumes, songs and posters
are bringing something of their own back."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg
35]</a></span>Mr. Thomson waved his hand.</p>
<p>"That is a matter of no concern," he pronounced. "Have you
anything further to say?"</p>
<p>I looked at Leonard and at Rose. We all three looked at our
host.</p>
<p>"I should like to know," I asked bluntly, "how much of my soul
was scotched by to-night's little adventure?"</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson stretched out his hand for the evening paper which
the waiter has just placed by his side.</p>
<p>"I do not wish to encourage curiosity," he remarked coldly.
"Our bargain renders any explanation on my part unnecessary. You
had better read aloud that item in the stop press news, however.
It may allay your qualms, if you are foolish enough to have
any."</p>
<p>The sheet was wet from the press. I held it under the light
and read:--</p>
<br>
<p class="headline">ARREST OF MOUNTJOY, THE CASTLE DERMOY
MURDERER!</p>
<p class="newspaper">Denis Mountjoy was arrested to-night at a
music hall in Watergate Street. A determined attempt was made at
a rescue, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id=
"Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> free fight took place outside the
Watergate Street police station, all the windows of which were
broken. With the arrest of Mountjoy, who will be charged with no
less than five murders, it is hoped that the whole conspiracy of
which he was the head will be broken up. It is known that he has
in his possession the famous minute book of the revolutionary
secret society which bore his name, and numerous other arrests
may be expected at any moment. The chief constable has received a
telephone message of congratulation from Scotland Yard.</p>
<br>
<p>I laid down the paper. For the life of me I could not keep
back the question which rose to my lips.</p>
<p>"There was five hundred pounds reward for the arrest of
Mountjoy. Are you claiming it?"</p>
<p>"Blood money," Mr. Thomson confessed, with a queer smile, "is
not in my line."</p>
<p>"It was you who put the police on to Mountjoy?" I
persisted.</p>
<p>He made no direct reply. He was stonily thoughtful for a
moment.</p>
<p>"I knew," he continued presently, "I believe even the police
knew, that Mountjoy was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37"
id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> lying hidden somewhere within a
quarter of a mile of Watergate Street. How to draw him out of his
hiding place was the problem. I remembered his two
failings,--vanity, and love of hearing that beautiful voice of
his. I pandered to them."</p>
<p>"You laid a trap on behalf of the police, then?"</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson knocked the ash from his cigar.</p>
<p>"That might be considered the truth," he admitted.</p>
<p>"And the minute book?"</p>
<p>"Concerning the minute book," he replied, "I have nothing to
say."</p>
<p>Rose drew her chair a little nearer towards him. The
rose-shaded electric light shone upon her fair hair, her
wonderful eyes, her piquant face with its alluring smile. She
leaned forward towards our host, and it seemed to me that the
soft entreaty in her tone and the pleading of her eyes were
irresistible.</p>
<p>"Mr. Thomson," she said, "I am a woman, and I am desperately,
insatiably curious. I must know--please tell me--what are
we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg
38]</a></span>--you and we three? Your confederates, I suppose we
are? Are we on the side of the police or the criminal, the
informer, or do we come somewhere between? I must adapt my
conscience to our position."</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson was unshaken. He looked at Rose just as though she
had been an ordinary human being.</p>
<p>"That," he said, "may be put in the category of questions
which you will be at liberty to ask me when our agreement comes
to an end. Shall we call it Conundrum Number 1? By the bye, if it
is any convenience to you to know your movements in advance, I
may tell you that you will open at Bath next week."</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg

<h2>CONUNDRUM #2.&mdash;WHAT HAPPENED AT BATH</h2>
<h3>First published in <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, Dec 1920</h3>
<h3>I</h3>
<p class="first">The thing which surprised me most about the
unseen hand which seemed to be always with us was the way in
which it disposed of the ladies' orchestra in the Crown Hotel at
Bath. I met the pianiste in the street while I was waiting for
instructions, and it was she who made the matter plain to me.</p>
<p>"I suppose you have heard that we have finished at the Crown
for the present?" she asked.</p>
<p>I had been genuinely surprised to hear that this was the case,
and I told her so. After a moment's hesitation, she unburdened
herself of a secret.</p>
<p>"Please don't tell a soul," she begged, "except Miss Mindel
and Mr. Cotton, if you want<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> to. The fact of it is,
the most extraordinary thing is taking us away. We have been
offered, without a word of explanation, a hundred pounds between
the four of us to go away for a month."</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"It is perfectly true," she repeated. "A lawyer in the city
brought the notes and an agreement, absolutely refusing a single
word of explanation. We didn't worry very much, I can tell you.
Twenty-five pounds isn't picked up every day, but I don't mind
confessing that when I think about it, I get so curious it makes
me positively ill. Miss Brown's theory is that it's one of these
old cranks in the hotel, with more money than he knows what to do
with, who hates music. On the other hand, the management has
received no complaints, and there's nothing to prevent another
orchestra taking our place next Monday."</p>
<p>I made my way to the lounge of the hotel where Leonard, Rose
and I had arranged to meet for afternoon tea. We were having
rather a quiet time, having already performed<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> for a
week at the local music hall with some success, and were now
obeying instructions by staying on at our rooms and waiting for
orders. There were too many people about for me to impart the
news to them at that moment, so we fell to criticising the
passers-by, an uninteresting crowd with one or two exceptions.
There was a large but not unwieldly man, carefully dressed, with
a walrus-like beard and moustache, heavy eyebrows and a surly
manner, who was generally muttering to himself. His name was
Grant, he was reputed to be over eighty, to be without a friend
in the hotel, and to growl at every one who spoke to him. Every
afternoon at half-past four he came in from a turn in his bath
chair, and stumped past the orchestra with his finger to his ear.
Then there was a frail, olive-skinned man, tall and gaunt, with
wonderful black eyes, escorted every day to the baths and brought
back again by a manservant who looked like a Cossack. His name
was Kinlosti, and he was reported to have been an official at the
Court of the late Tsar, and even to have accompanied him to
Siberia. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id=
"Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> third person, who interested us
because we all detested her, was an enormously fat old lady, with
false teeth, false grey ringlets, a profusion of jewellery, and a
voice which Leonard said reminded him of the hissing of a
rattlesnake. Her name was Mrs. Cotesham, she was stone deaf, and
between her and Mr. Grant there was a deadly feud. They never
spoke, but if glances could kill both would have been in their
coffins many times a day. They both wanted the same chair in
front of the fire, they both struggled for the <i>Times</i> after
lunch, they ordered their coffee at the same moment, and
whichever was served last bullied the waiter. They provided
plenty of amusement for lookers-on and to the guests generally,
but I think that the management, and certainly the waiters, were
prepared to welcome the day they left the hotel. When the people
had thinned out a little, and there was no one in our immediate
vicinity, I told my two companions of the strange thing which had
happened to the ladies' orchestra.</p>
<p>"It must have been Mr. Grant," Rose declared.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg
43]</a></span>"I put my money on the old lady," Leonard
decided.</p>
<p>But I knew that it was neither, for even while they were
speaking the hall porter, who knew me by sight, had brought me a
typewritten note, which he said had been left by hand. I tore it
open and read. There was no address nor any signature. Neither
was needed:</p>
<br>
<p class="note" style="text-align:left"><tt>Apply at office of
Crown Hotel for permission to give entertainments, commencing
soon as possible.</tt></p>
<br>
<p>I passed the note on to the others.</p>
<p>"We needn't speculate any more about that hundred pounds," I
remarked.</p>
<p>There were no difficulties at the office. The next afternoon,
at half-past four, we took the place of the departed orchestra.
The change was pleasantly received by the majority of the guests.
Mr. Grant, however, while Rose was still in the middle of her
introductory pianoforte solo, stumped out of the room with his
hand to his ear, and Mrs. Cotesham deliberately turned her chair
round and sat with her back to us. On the other hand, Mr.
Kinlosti,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg
44]</a></span> passing through the hall leaning on his servant's
arm, on his way from his bath, caught sight of Rose at the piano
and lingered. He whispered in his servant's ear, found a chair
and a table, and seated himself in a dark corner. Presently the
latter brought him from upstairs a pot of specially prepared tea
and some cigarettes. He remained there throughout the whole of
our performance, his eyes fixed upon Rose,--strange, uncanny eyes
they were. The corner he had chosen was close to where we were
playing, and the flavour of his Russian cigarettes and highly
scented tea attracted Rose's attention, so that more than once
she turned and looked at him. For the first time I saw a very
faint smile part his thin lips.</p>
<p>"A conquest," I whispered to Rose, as I bent over her chair to
move some music.</p>
<p>She made a little grimace.</p>
<p>"All the same," she said, "I'd love some of his
cigarettes."</p>
<p>That evening, just before the time fixed for the commencement
of our performance, another typewritten note was put into my
hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg
45]</a></span> again unsigned and undated. This is what I
read:</p>
<br>
<p class="note" style="text-align:left"><tt>It is my wish that if
a person of the name of Kinlosti should seek acquaintance with
any of you, he should be encouraged. Particularly impress this
upon Miss Mindel.</tt></p>
<br>
<p>I took Leonard on one side.</p>
<p>"Leonard," I said, "our souls are trash, and what happens to
us doesn't matter a damn. But read this!"</p>
<p>Leonard read it and swore.</p>
<p>"Can you get into touch with Thomson?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Only through the banker's address in London," I replied.
"Where these typewritten notes drop from not a soul seems to
know."</p>
<p>Rose came up and read the message over our shoulders. Her view
of the matter was different.</p>
<p>"What fun!" she exclaimed. "Perhaps I shall get some
cigarettes."</p>
<p>"You don't suppose we are going to allow this?" I asked
hotly.</p>
<p>"Not for one moment!" Leonard echoed.</p>
<p>She laughed softly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg
46]</a></span>"You idiots!" she exclaimed. "Do you think I can't
take care of myself? Or don't you trust me?"</p>
<p>"You know that it isn't that," I rejoined, "but neither
Leonard nor I are willing to see you made a cat's-paw of."</p>
<p>"Russians don't know how to treat women," Leonard put in.</p>
<p>She became serious, but she remained very determined.</p>
<p>"Anyhow," she said, "I know how to treat Russians, so please
leave me alone. Remember that I, too, am under contract to Mr.
Mephistopheles Thomson, and although I love you both, you're not
my guardians."</p>
<p>That was the end of the matter, so far as we were concerned.
When we commenced our performance, Kinlosti was established in
the dark corner, his coffee and a whole box of his inevitable
cigarettes before him. His dinner clothes were severe and
unadorned, but three wonderful black pearls shone dully in his
shirt front. The lounge was more than ordinarily full, for our
previous week's performance in Bath had brought us some
popularity. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id=
"Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> Grant, however, again stumped out of
the place, muttering rudely to himself as he passed us, and the
old lady turned her back and tried by means of an ear trumpet to
enter into conversation with any one who was unfortunate enough
to be near. These two were the only exceptions, however. The rest
of the audience was unmistakably friendly.</p>
<p>Leonard and I were to learn something that night of the
subtlety of a woman's ways. No one who had been watching could
have said that she deliberately encouraged this mysterious
admirer. On the other hand, she returned his bold glances with
something which I had never seen in her eyes before, something
indefinably provocative, certainly with no shadow of rebuke. Her
acceptance of his overt admiration was in itself a more
significant thing than the frank smiles of a more easily
accessible siren. By the time I started off round with the plate
for the usual silver collection, I was in such a temper that I
found it difficult to pause even for a moment as I reached his
corner. He laid a ten-shilling note upon the little pile of
silver, and also placed an envelope<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> there. I saw with
gathering anger that it contained something heavy, and that it
was addressed to Miss Mindel.</p>
<p>"I have ventured," he said, in a very low and extraordinarily
pleasant voice, "to offer for the young lady's acceptance, in
return for her delightful music, a little souvenir from the
country in which I have lived all my life."</p>
<p>"Miss Mindel does not accept presents from strangers, sir," I
said, returning him the envelope.</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders slightly, stretched out his hand for
his jade-headed stick, and, leaning heavily upon it, crossed the
floor towards the spot where Rose was seated at the piano,
playing soft music. Notwithstanding his lameness, his bow, as he
approached her, would have done credit to a courtier.</p>
<p>"May I be allowed," he said, "to congratulate you upon your
very delightful singing and playing? It has given so much
pleasure to an invalid whose life just now is very monotonous,
that I am venturing to ask your accept<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>ance
of this little trifle, a souvenir from a great country, now,
alas! stricken to the earth."</p>
<p>Rose opened the envelope, and held in her hand a quaint ring
in which was a black stone. I leaned over her. It was engraved
with the royal arms of the Romanoffs, and at the top was a small
'N.'</p>
<p>"I thank you very much indeed," she replied, smiling up at
him, "but I could not possibly accept so valuable a gift."</p>
<p>"Will you believe me," he persisted, "that the ring has
little, if any, intrinsic value. It is an offering which an
artist in a small way might at any time be permitted to present
to such gifts as yours."</p>
<p>He passed on towards the lift with a little bow which included
all of us, and somehow or other the ring was on Rose's finger,
and whether we liked it or not she had accepted it. After that we
saw a great deal of Mr. Kinlosti. He was never obtrusive and yet
he was persistent. On the day following the presentation of the
ring, we somehow found ourselves lunching with him. On the day
after that we used his car, and on the following day,
al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg
50]</a></span>though both Leonard and I protested, he took Rose
out for a drive alone. She came home sooner than we had expected
and was a little silent for the rest of that day. At supper time
she took us into her confidence.</p>
<p>"Mr. Kinlosti," she said, "told me a very strange story this
afternoon. Parts of it were so horrible that it made me shiver.
It seems he was one of the few members of the household who
accompanied Nicholas to Siberia. He got away just before the
final tragedy."</p>
<p>"What was his excuse for leaving his master?" I asked, a
little coldly.</p>
<p>We were all three in the parlour of our lodging house, and
quite alone. Nevertheless, Rose lowered her voice as she answered
me.</p>
<p>"The Tsar entrusted him with the knowledge of where a portion
of the Crown jewels were secreted. He was to find them, raise
money, and try and bribe the Siberian Guards. He found the jewels
all right, but not until Nicholas and the whole of his family had
been assassinated."</p>
<p>"What did he do with the jewels?" Leonard asked.<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>
<p>"He has not told me so in so many words, but I believe that he
has them here," she replied. "He told me they were still in his
possession and he held them in trust for the Romanoffs. The
terrible part of the business for him is that he has been tracked
all over Europe by Bolshevist agents, who claim that the jewels
belong to the Russian State."</p>
<p>"Why did he tell you all this?" I enquired, with growing
suspicion.</p>
<p>Rose shook her head.</p>
<p>"Perhaps to account for the fact that he seemed so nervous all
the time," she suggested. "He started whenever another motor car
passed us, and as long as we were in Bath itself he watched the
faces on the pavements, as though all the time he were looking
for some one. He told me that when first he arrived here he
suspected even the masseurs at the baths."</p>
<p>"I still don't see why he was so confidential with you,"
Leonard grumbled.</p>
<p>"He likes me," she acknowledged, with a demure smile. "In
fact, if he tells the truth, he likes me very much. Don't look so
black,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg
52]</a></span> please," she went on, with a glance at our faces.
"Remember I am only obeying orders."</p>
<p>That phrase cost us a good deal of uneasiness during the next
few days. Whenever we performed, Kinlosti sat in his corner,
watching and listening. In the intervals, he came and made timid
and courteous conversation. Without going so far as to say that
he pursued Rose, he certainly took up a great deal of her time.
On the fourth afternoon I received another typewritten note,
handed to me again from the porter's office without any
intimation as to its source. There was only a line or two:</p>
<br>
<p class="note" style="text-align:left"><tt>Miss Mindel should
show some curiosity as to the Crown Jewels. Mr. Kinlosti would
probably like to show them to her.</tt></p>
<br>
<p>Within half an hour Rose made her request. Both Leonard and I
were within a few yards, and we saw the sudden terror in his
face, heard his almost hysterical refusal.</p>
<p>"No one has ever seen them," he told Rose, "since they first
came into my possession. I do not dare even to look at them
myself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg
53]</a></span> Directly my rheumatism permits me to move without
pain, I shall acquit myself of the trust. It weighs upon me night
and day."</p>
<p>With that the matter would have been ended, so far as Leonard
and myself were concerned. Rose, however, took it differently.
For the rest of that afternoon we were able to appreciate fully
the guile of our little companion. She received Kinlosti's
refusal in silence. Presently she developed a headache and
refused to talk. She sat with her shoulder turned away from him
while she played and never once glanced in his direction while
she sang. At the close of our performance, he came up and
whispered to her earnestly. She shook her head at first and then
turned to me.</p>
<p>"Mr. Kinlosti is going to show me something in his sitting
room. Please come with us."</p>
<p>For the first time I saw the Russian in this sallow-faced
invalid. His lips curved into a snarl and for a moment he glared
at me. The fit of anger was gone in a moment, before Rose had
even observed it. With a little courteous gesture towards her, he
turned and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id=
"Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> limped towards the lift. We
followed, and he led us into his suite on the first floor.</p>
<p>"Do not be frightened of John," he enjoined, as he opened the
door. "John is the guardian of my treasure, and he is obsessed
with the idea that there are thieves in this hotel."</p>
<p>From the appearance of John, it seemed as though any
adventurous thieves would have had a pretty poor time. He was
seated with folded arms upon a hard, straight-backed chair. On a
table by his side, only partially concealed by a large
handkerchief, was an obvious revolver. There was also a glass of
strong brandy and water. He rose to his feet at our entrance, but
his bearing was grim and unfriendly. His master talked to him for
a few moments in his own language, apparently trying to assure
him of the harmlessness of our presence. John, however, remained
sulky. Kinlosti crossed to the farthest corner of the room, took
a key from his pocket, a key which seemed to be attached to a
band of snakelike silver which encircled his leg, and unfastened
an ordinary black tin dispatch box, which<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> stood
on the floor. From this he drew out a coffer of some almost
black-coloured wood, with brass clamps. He held it up towards
Rose.</p>
<p>"Even for you, my dear young friend," he said, "I may not
raise the lid, but I show you this much of your desire. This is
one of the coffers which for eleven hundred years has held the
ceremonial jewels of the Russian Royal Family. There were at one
time five of them. This is the one that remains."</p>
<p>"Mayn't I have just one little peep inside?" Rose pleaded.</p>
<p>We heard John's heavy breathing, and Kinlosti scarcely waited
even to answer her. He thrust the coffer back into the box and
locked it.</p>
<p>"It is impossible," he pronounced. "I do not bear this trust
alone. In the spirit I fear that I break it already. You will
rest here for a little while, mademoiselle?"</p>
<p>If this was meant as a hint to me, it was of no avail. I stood
by Rose's side and she shook her head.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg
56]</a></span>"You will not let me make you some of our own
Russian tea?" he begged.</p>
<p>"Bring me some downstairs," she suggested. "I should love the
tea, if it isn't too much trouble, and I will come over and sit
in your corner."</p>
<p>In the corridor, on our way down, we met the malevolent Mrs.
Cotesham, who paused, leaning on her stick, and watched Rose and
her companion with the hungry glare of the professional
scandalmonger. Kinlosti hurried past her with a little shiver,
and Rose laughed gaily as she descended the stairs.</p>
<p>"I believe that you have a penchant for Mrs. Cotesham," she
declared.</p>
<p>"She is the most horrible old lady I have ever seen anywhere,"
he said fervently. "They tell me that she is over ninety, and
that she has but one joy in life--to make where she can mischief
and trouble and unhappiness. She comes here every year, and every
servant hates her. Even the managers would keep her away if they
could, but she has bought shares in the hotel and has interest
with the directors."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg
57]</a></span>"The old man Mr. Grant is nearly as bad," Rose
remarked.</p>
<p>"Him I know nothing of," Kinlosti replied, "save that he is
one of those who have surely lived too long."</p>
<p>Leonard and I left Rose to her t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te
and took a seat in the lounge. A few yards from us, the little
daily comedy which never failed to amuse the onlookers was in
progress. Mr. Grant was seated in the easy chair affected by Mrs.
Cotesham. She came stumping along from the lift and stopped about
a foot from the chair.</p>
<p>"This man has taken my chair!" she exclaimed in a loud voice,
for the benefit of every one. "I left a book in it."</p>
<p>Mr. Grant continued to read through his heavy spectacles,
unmoved. She struck the side of his chair with her stick.</p>
<p>"I want my chair," she repeated.</p>
<p>Mr. Grant half turned round.</p>
<p>"What does the woman want?" he snarled. "This isn't her chair.
It's an hotel chair. I found it empty and I sat down. I am going
to stay."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg
58]</a></span>"Where's my book?" Mrs. Cotesham demanded, handing
him the end of her ear trumpet.</p>
<p>"I threw it on the lounge," he shouted. "There it is. Now
don't bother me any more."</p>
<p>"He calls himself a gentleman!" the old lady declared, shaking
with fury.</p>
<p>"Never called myself anything of the sort in my life," he
snapped.</p>
<p>I rose, and wheeled the easy chair in which I was sitting to
the side of Mr. Grant's.</p>
<p>"Will you sit here, madam?" I ventured. "It is as near your
favourite position as possible."</p>
<p>She pushed her speaking trumpet almost into my face.</p>
<p>"Say that again, young man," she directed.</p>
<p>I repeated it at the top of my voice. She nodded and subsided
into the chair.</p>
<p>"I don't like having to sit near such people," she said, "but
I prefer this side of the fireplace."</p>
<p>Her neighbour looked out of the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>"I wish the pestilential old woman would<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> stay
up in her room," he growled. "I hate her next me."</p>
<p>She handed him her speaking trumpet.</p>
<p>"Say that again, will you?" she invited. "I don't like people
talking about me when I can't hear what they say."</p>
<p>Mr. Grant shut his book with a snap, rose to his feet and
hobbled across to a distant part of the lounge.</p>
<p>"That old woman ought to be locked up," he declared at the top
of his voice. "She's a damned nuisance to everybody!"</p>
<p>He found another seat and recommenced his book. Mrs. Cotesham,
with a purr of content, settled herself down in the chair which
he had vacated, stretched out her feet upon the footstool and
looked around triumphantly.</p>
<p>"I've been to a good many hotels in my life," she confided to
every one within hearing, "but I never met a man who called
himself a gentleman, with such disgusting manners!"</p>
<p>Leonard and I strolled away presently to find Rose. It was
time for us to go back to our rooms and change for the evening
performance. We found her with Kinlosti in his<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
corner, and the air above them overhung with a thin cloud of blue
tobacco smoke. Kinlosti was smoking furiously and talking hard.
Rose welcomed our approach, I thought, with something almost like
eagerness.</p>
<p>"It is time to go, I am sure," she declared, springing to her
feet.</p>
<p>Her companion broke off in the middle of a sentence and
frowned.</p>
<p>"We speak together to-night, then?"</p>
<p>She shook her head at him, smiling all the time though, and
with that little tantalising look in her eyes which Leonard and I
both knew so well.</p>
<p>"I am not sure," she replied. "The management will complain if
I talk so much with one of the guests, but I will play 'Valse
Triste' for you. Au revoir!"</p>
<p>We had almost left the hotel--we were on the outside steps,
indeed--when the hall porter caught me up. I saw at once what he
was carrying. It was one of the now familiar typewritten letters.
This time I asked him a point-blank question.</p>
<p>"Look here," I said, with my hand in my<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
trousers pocket, "this is the third note I have received from my
friend in this fashion. I want to know how they come into your
possession. Who leaves them at the bureau?"</p>
<p>The man saw the ten-shilling note in my hand but he only shook
his head. I believe that he was perfectly honest.</p>
<p>"I would tell you in a minute if I knew, sir," he declared,
"but to tell you the truth I have never seen one delivered. All
three I have picked up from the desk in my office, evidently left
there when my back was turned for a moment."</p>
<p>"You haven't any idea who leaves them there, then?" I
persisted.</p>
<p>"Not the slightest, sir," the man assured me.</p>
<p>"Keep a good lookout," I begged him, "and let me know if you
do find out. There may be another one--I can't tell--but I'll
double this ten shillings if you succeed."</p>
<p>The man thanked me and withdrew. We three crossed to the less
frequented side of the road. I walked in the middle, with Rose
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg
62]</a></span> Leonard on either arm. We read the note
together:</p>
<br>
<p class="note" style="text-align:left"><tt>If the box Miss
Mindel saw in Kinlosti's room was of purple leather, with gold
clasps and corners, let the first item in your repertoire
to-night be the Missouri Waltz. If it was a box of any other
description, play the selection from "Chu-Chin-Chow."</tt></p>
<br>
<p>"Well, I'm damned!" Leonard exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Be careful," I advised. "Thomson's probably underneath these
paving stones."</p>
<p>Rose shivered a little.</p>
<p>"Do you think he wants to steal the jewels, Maurice?" she
asked me.</p>
<p>"Oh, no!" I answered. "He probably wants to borrow them to
wear at the Lord Mayor's show!"</p>
<p>She made a grimace.</p>
<p>"That's all very well, Mr. Lister," she said, with a great
attempt at hauteur, "but will you kindly remember that you two
are not in at this show? It is I who seem to be chosen as
principal accomplice. I am not exactly infatuated with Mr.
Kinlosti, but I don't want him to lose his jewels."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg
63]</a></span>"I bet you a four-pound box of chocolates he does
lose them," Leonard observed.</p>
<p>Rose sighed.</p>
<p>"Anyhow," she murmured, "we shall have to play 'Chu-Chin-Chow'
to-night."</p>
<p>Leonard and Rose played a selection from "Chu-Chin-Chow" that
evening as well as they could with an extemporised rendering.
Rose played the piano, Leonard the violin, and I pretended to be
turning over the pages of the music, although all the time I was
engaged in a furtive search of the crowded lounge for some sign
of our patron or a possible emissary. There were the usual little
groups about, and a more harmless or obvious set of people I
don't think I ever came across. Mrs. Cotesham was seated with her
back to us, with a shawl arranged around her head so as to still
further deaden sound, and ostentatiously reading a novel. Mr.
Grant had stumped past us on his way to the billiard room,
muttering to himself, before the first few bars of our little
effort had been played. The others were nearly all known to us by
name or reputation. There seemed something uncanny in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg
64]</a></span> thought that somewhere or other were ears waiting
for the message our selection conveyed. We were half-way through
the "Cobbler's Song" when, without the slightest warning, Rose,
who was facing the staircase, broke off abruptly in her playing.
I caught sight of her face, suddenly pale, upturned towards the
head of the staircase, followed the direction of her gaze, and
was myself stricken dumb and nerveless. At the top of the
staircase John was standing, holding out a terrified, struggling
figure almost at arm's length. The fingers of his right hand
seemed to be clasped around the neck of his unfortunate victim,
while with his left hand he held him by the ankle. This was all
in full view of the lounge. There were shrieks from the women,
and some of the men, amongst them myself, hurried towards the
staircase. We were too late, however, to be of any practical use.
John, who seemed like a man beside himself with passion, suddenly
swung the prostrate form of his captive a little farther back,
and then dashed it from him down the stairs. A little cry of
horror rippled and sobbed through the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>tense
air. The man lay on the rug at the bottom of the stairs, a
crumpled-up heap, motionless and without speech.<br>
<br></p>
<p><a id="pic2" name="pic2"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>

<br>
<h3>II</h3>
<p class="first">I was one of those who helped to carry the
unfortunate victim of John's fury into the manager's office. He
appeared to be a man of about medium height and build, dressed in
the severest clerical clothes. I remembered having seen him
arrive on the previous day. We laid him upon a sofa and left him
there while one of us telephoned for a doctor. Out in the lounge,
every one was grouped around the stairs, where Kinlosti was
talking to John. The veins of the latter's temples were still
standing out, but he was rapidly calming down. He spoke in a loud
voice, so that every one might hear.</p>
<p>"That man is a thief in disguise," he shouted. "You will find
burglar's tools in his pocket and a revolver. He came into the
room where I was guarding my master's property, pretended to have
mistaken the room, and tried<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> to slip in behind me. I
was too quick for him. He has followed us from Russia, that man.
My master will tell you."</p>
<p>The manager, who had been lingering in the background, came
down the stairs.</p>
<p>"The man's story may be true," he said. "Two of the maids saw
him hanging about. They heard the altercation, and there is a
chloroformed handkerchief in the sitting room."</p>
<p>"I have a valuable box there," Kinlosti explained, "which it
is my servant's duty to guard. It contains property which belongs
to the dead."</p>
<p>"All the same," one of the bystanders observed, "one does not
treat even a thief like that. The man's neck is probably
broken."</p>
<p>Kinlosti seemed to have lost his nervousness in this minute of
crisis.</p>
<p>"I beg," he said to the manager, "that you will await the
doctor's verdict before you send for the police. If the man is
not seriously injured, he got no more than his deserts. It was
John's duty to guard what he was guarding with his life."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg
67]</a></span>"Here is the doctor," the manager announced.</p>
<p>Half a dozen of us followed the manager and the doctor back to
the room where we had carried the injured man. When we opened the
door, however, we were faced with a great surprise. There was a
current of cold air, the window was wide open, the sofa was
empty! To all appearance, a miracle had happened. We examined the
ground below the window and found traces of where a man had
stepped out. To those of us who had seen the fall, the thing grew
more wonderful the more we thought of it.</p>
<p>"I think," the doctor pronounced, "that this is more a case
for the police."</p>
<p>Kinlosti shook his head.</p>
<p>"I do not think," he said drily, "that the police of Bath are
likely to be of much service in this matter."</p>
<p>"You have a suspicion, perhaps?" the manager asked.</p>
<p>Kinlosti smiled a little bitterly.</p>
<p>"I know the people who have been following me," he replied,
"who would follow me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id=
"Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> around the world until I am quit of
my trust. They are Jugo-Slav Jews, boneless and bloodless as the
worm that you cut in two only to find of dual life. No Bath
policeman will ever lay hands upon that seemingly reverend
gentleman."</p>
<p>"At the same time," the manager said a little stiffly, "I
shall give information. It appears that he wrote for a room a
week ago, from a vicarage near London, and signed himself 'The
Reverend Edward Cummings.'"</p>
<p>"You will find that vicarage a myth," Kinlosti observed, "as
much a myth as the Reverend Edward Cummings himself."</p>
<p>The sensation died away. We all drifted back to our places. At
the manager's earnest request we recommenced our programme, but I
am quite sure that no one listened, for the buzz of conversation
almost drowned the sound of our instruments. The manager carried
on an earnest conversation with Kinlosti in his corner, greatly,
apparently, to the latter's distress. After our first essay we
attempted no more music. Leonard went off to speak to some
friends in the lounge. I was talking to<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> Rose
and showing her a paragraph in the evening paper, when Kinlosti
approached.</p>
<p>"It is very distressing," he said. "Because of this
unfortunate happening, the manager has asked me to leave the
hotel. Every place in Bath is full, and my cure is not
complete."</p>
<p>I showed him the paragraph in the paper.</p>
<p>"You may not be able to go," I pointed out. "It seems that
there is every possibility of a railway strike being declared
to-night."</p>
<p>He glanced at the paragraph and returned the paper to me
unmoved.</p>
<p>"It would not affect me," he said. "I travel everywhere by
car. I think after what has happened I shall go. In London I can
acquit myself of my trust. I see that the person who is empowered
to take over my responsibility is back in London a few days
sooner than he was expected."</p>
<p>I looked at the paragraph underneath the one which I had
indicated, which announced that a royal personage had returned to
London a few days earlier than intended, owing to the threatened
strike.</p>
<p>"To-morrow," Kinlosti continued quietly,<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> "I
shall order my car and depart. It will perhaps be better. If
things get worse, they may commandeer the petrol. I will rid
myself of this responsibility and either return or try Harrogate.
You three will come up and have a bottle of wine with me and some
sandwiches?"</p>
<p>Rose, to my joy, was quite firm in her refusal. She returned
with him to his corner, however, and they sat there with their
heads very close together whilst Leonard and I fidgetted about in
the lounge. A period of quietude had followed the excitement of
the last half-hour. Mr. Grant had apparently fallen asleep in his
easy chair. Mrs. Cotesham watched him malevolently through her
horn-rimmed spectacles.</p>
<p>"What a pity for a man to make such ugly noises when he's
asleep!" she remarked to her neighbour. "I wish some one would
wake him up. He's disturbing the whole room."</p>
<p>Mr. Grant opened one eye, then the other. Finally he sat
up.</p>
<p>"Madam," he shouted, as she raised her<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
trumpet to her ear, "you forget that I am not like
you--deaf!"</p>
<p>"I don't care whether you are or not," she replied. "I'm glad
I woke you up. Bed's the place for you."</p>
<p>"A coffin's the place for you," Mr. Grant muttered under his
breath. "How are you going to get away from here, ma'am?" he
continued, raising his tone. "I hear your rooms are let from
to-morrow."</p>
<p>"I sha'n't ask you for a place in your car," she answered.
"Very likely I sha'n't go. They can't turn me out."</p>
<p>"I don't think they'll miss the opportunity," her interlocutor
retorted, with a sardonic smile.</p>
<p>She laid her speaking trumpet in her lap.</p>
<p>"I sha'n't listen to you any more," she declared. "You're a
rude old man. If it interests any one else to know what will
become of me, I have relatives in Bristol who will be only too
glad for me to pay them a visit."</p>
<p>"They'll be gladder to get rid of her," Mr. Grant observed,
looking around for sympathy.</p>
<p>At that moment the hall porter touched me<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> on
the shoulder. The inevitable note was thrust into my hand.</p>
<p>"I found this on my desk just now, sir," he announced, in
answer to my look of enquiry. "Sorry I can't tell you how it got
there."</p>
<p>I opened it and read:</p>
<br>
<p class="note" style="text-align:left"><tt>You will terminate
your engagement at the Crown this evening. Proceed to London
to-morrow, where you will find rooms taken for you at the Mayfair
Hotel. Accept any offer you may receive of a lift to London,
individually or collectively.</tt></p>
<br>
<p>I showed Leonard the note, and hurried away to the manager's
office. He made no difficulty about letting us go; in fact, I
gathered that half the residents in the hotel were hurrying away
by motor car, fearing a general confiscation of petrol. He
detained me just as I was leaving the room.</p>
<p>"Queer affair, that attempted robbery, Mr. Lister," he
remarked.</p>
<p>"Extraordinary," I agreed.</p>
<p>"I notice you people seem quite friendly with Mr. Kinlosti,"
he continued. "Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id=
"Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> know if it is true that he is
related to the late Tsar?"</p>
<p>"I have no idea," I answered. "All that he has told us is that
he was a member of the household."</p>
<p>"He may be a nobleman, and I dare say he is," the manager went
on, a little nervously, "but I don't care about people at my
hotel with a savage manservant like his and half a million
pounds' worth of jewels. Bath isn't the place for that sort of
thing. My clients like a quiet life."</p>
<p>"No doubt," I answered. "Anyhow, he's leaving to-morrow."</p>
<p>"Prince or no prince, I am glad to hear it," was the heartfelt
reply. "People ought to deposit valuables like that in a bank.
They're simply asking for trouble when they cart them about the
country. It's a thing I've very seldom done to a client, but I
told Mr. Kinlosti this evening that I should be glad for him to
leave as soon as convenient."</p>
<p>I went back to the corner where I had left Rose. My
disquietude increased as I approached. Both she and her companion
were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg
74]</a></span> quite unconscious of my coming. Kinlosti was
leaning forward, talking earnestly, and Rose was listening with a
queer and unfamiliar look in her eyes. Leonard suddenly gripped
me by the arm and led me a little distance away.</p>
<p>"Maurice," he confided, "that fellow Kinlosti is making love
to her."</p>
<p>"If I thought so!" I muttered, clenching my fists.</p>
<p>"But she's letting him," Leonard groaned. "What the mischief
can we do? We've no hold over her. Owing to that silly bargain we
made, she doesn't dream that either of us care a snap of the
fingers about her, except as a little pal and a partner. It's all
clear sailing for that unwholesome brute."</p>
<p>My anger died away, but a very solid determination was there
in its place.</p>
<p>"Leonard," I said, "we aren't going to leave her, and whatever
happens, we'll know more about that fellow before many days have
passed."</p>
<p>I retraced my steps then and went up to them. There was
certainly a change in Rose's<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> face. Kinlosti looked
up at me a little impatiently.</p>
<p>"Is it late?" he asked. "I am leaving to-morrow, and I am
anxious to have a few minutes' more conversation with Miss
Mindel."</p>
<p>"As it happens, we are leaving ourselves," I replied. "I
thought perhaps that Miss Mindel would like to know."</p>
<p>"What, to-morrow?" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>"I have received a message," I told her.</p>
<p>She sprang up and drew me to one side, with a little nod to
Kinlosti which seemed to promise a swift return. I showed her the
typewritten sheet.</p>
<p>"Maurice," she whispered, "Mr. Kinlosti has already been
begging me to accept a seat in his car to London to-morrow."</p>
<p>"Indeed!" I answered coldly.</p>
<p>"Of course, I never had any idea of leaving you two," she went
on, "but now--well, you see what our instructions are."</p>
<p>"Damn our instructions!" I muttered, losing control of myself
for a moment. "Rose, you're not falling in love with that
fellow?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg
76]</a></span>"Don't be foolish, please," she answered, "and
don't call him a fellow."</p>
<p>"I'll call him a scoundrel if he behaves like one," I
retorted.</p>
<p>She looked at me queerly for a moment. I thought that she was
going to be angry, but she answered me without any signs of
ill-feeling.</p>
<p>"You and Leonard are both very kind in looking after me," she
admitted, "but after all I am quite able, when it is necessary,
to make up my mind for myself on things that concern me
personally."</p>
<p>"You're not going up to London alone with Kinlosti," I said
doggedly.</p>
<p>She swung around and rejoined him before I could reply.
Leonard and I went and fetched our coats and hats. A little
ostentatiously we laid her fur coat upon the top of the piano and
waited. In a moment or two she got up and came over towards us,
Kinlosti by her side. He turned courteously to me.</p>
<p>"Miss Mindel reminds me that you also are leaving Bath
to-morrow. I have two seats in my car, one of which I have
offered to Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id=
"Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> Mindel. If the other is of any
service to you, I shall be delighted."</p>
<p>I thanked him a little perfunctorily.</p>
<p>"We don't, as a rule, separate when we have a journey to
make," I said. "However, in this case the circumstances are a
little exceptional. If you will take Miss Mindel and Mr. Cotton,
I dare say I can manage to get up somehow."</p>
<p>"We can't leave you, Maurice," Rose protested.</p>
<p>"So far as I am concerned, I am afraid it must be so,"
Kinlosti intervened, in a tone full of courteous regret. "I have
John outside with the chauffeur, and there is only room for two
comfortably in the inside. We shall have to improvise a seat for
Mr. Cotton."</p>
<p>"You don't anticipate any adventures on the way, I suppose?" I
asked. "Nothing after the style of this evening's
happenings?"</p>
<p>"I sincerely trust not," was the earnest reply. "However, both
John and I are armed, and I do not think any one will venture so
far as to hold up the car."</p>
<p>"In that case, Rose," I said, "I think you and Leonard had
better accept Mr. Kinlosti's<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> offer. At the worst I
hear there are some char-&agrave;-bancs running. I shall probably
get a lift. At what hour did you think of starting?"</p>
<p>"At nine o'clock, if Miss Mindel doesn't mind," Kinlosti
answered hastily. "The sooner we get away, the better. My
chauffeur tells me that they are asking two pounds a tin for
petrol, and a Government order, commandeering stocks, is expected
out to-morrow."</p>
<p>We were more silent than usual on our walk home, perhaps
because the events of the evening had left us all something to
think about. Once Rose pressed my arm.</p>
<p>"I feel rather mean about you to-morrow, Maurice," she
ventured.</p>
<p>I reminded her of the mandate we had received.</p>
<p>"No help for it. Two were invited and two have to go. I can't
tell what surprises may be in store for me. I may get an
invitation myself."</p>
<p>Rose turned a troubled face towards me. Her lips quivered a
little, her eyes were full of distress.</p>
<p>"Maurice," she confessed, "I'm afraid of<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
to-morrow. I'm afraid that we are being made use of to rob Mr.
Kinlosti."</p>
<p>"Can't be helped," Leonard put in, as I remained for a moment
silent. "We took this business on with our eyes open. Our
consciences weren't very active when we were starving and cold
and in debt. It's no good finding them too sensitive now that
we're living on the fat of the land. We've just got to see the
thing through, for a year, at any rate."</p>
<p>"Leonard is right," I assented. "We've got to grin and bear
it. This time," I added, "it seems as though you two were going
to have the show to yourself."</p>
<p>"You can have my share," Rose sighed.</p>
<h3>* * * * *</h3>
<p>The hall of the Crown Hotel at a few minutes before nine on
the following morning presented a scene of curious animation. All
trains had ceased to run, and rumours as to the Government
commandeering of petrol were universal. Fully a score of cars
were outside, waiting, besides one of the smaller
char-&agrave;-bancs, and half a dozen luggage porters were
working their hardest. Kinlosti, looking<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
curiously shrunken in a great fur coat, pale and nervous, greeted
us on the steps. His car, laden with luggage, stood at the
entrance. On the box seat sat John, an immovable figure of fierce
watchfulness.</p>
<p>"We could start any time you liked," Kinlosti said, addressing
Rose eagerly. "We have left room for your trunk behind, and there
will be a quite comfortable place for Mr. Cotton. You are ready,
Miss Mindel?"</p>
<p>"Quite," she answered.</p>
<p>He gripped Leonard's arm and commenced to descend the steps.
It was obvious that he was in great pain, and I supported him on
the other side. Outside, a grey mist hung over the street, and he
shivered as we made our slow progress.</p>
<p>"It is the damp which has brought this on again," he confided.
"Only a few days ago I was better. Every one says the same thing.
It is when one leaves here that one reaps the benefit of the
treatment. I am ashamed to be so much trouble."</p>
<p>We had almost to lift him into the car, and notwithstanding
the chill of the morning, there<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> were beads of
perspiration upon his forehead. Rose took her place by his side,
and Leonard on a camp stool placed against the door. I felt a
little forlorn as I saw them start, but I waved my hand
encouragingly.</p>
<p>"I'll get up somehow," I shouted. "See you to-night."</p>
<p>I turned back into the hotel to look for the driver of the
char-&agrave;-banc and try to bargain with him for a seat to
London. Mrs. Cotesham, almost undistinguishable in rugs and
wraps, was seated on a chair, watching the carrying out of her
luggage, all neatly wrapped, after the continental fashion, in
brown holland covers. She counted the articles one by one as they
passed, muttering to herself all the time.</p>
<p>"Never another shilling shall any railway porter have so long
as I live!--eleven--one more. And as to the management of this
hotel, I call it disgraceful! Flung out like cattle, that's
what's happening to us!"</p>
<p>Mr. Grant, also attired for motoring, came shuffling along. He
picked up Mrs. Cotesham's speaking trumpet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg
82]</a></span>"Got any one to take you in?" he asked.</p>
<p>She snatched it away from him.</p>
<p>"Of course I have," she answered. "I'm not a miserable,
disagreeable old curmudgeon like you! My friends are glad to have
me pay them a visit."</p>
<p>Mr. Grant chuckled.</p>
<p>"Gladder to get rid of you, I know!"</p>
<p>His eye fell upon me.</p>
<p>"Well, young Mr. Musician," he went on, "how are you going to
get away? Pad the hoof, eh, as your sort used to a few hundred
years ago?"</p>
<p>"Not at all," I answered cheerfully. "I'm hoping some one will
offer me a lift to London. If not, I shall have to buy a seat for
myself in the char-&agrave;-banc."</p>
<p>The hall porter, who was passing, shook his head.</p>
<p>"Not a bit of use thinking about the char-&agrave;-banc, sir,"
he said. "We've a dozen guests in the hotel we've had to refuse
already."</p>
<p>Mr. Grant chuckled.</p>
<p>"Good walker, eh, young man?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, I could get there, all right," I assured<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> him,
"but it won't be necessary. Why won't you give me a lift, sir?" I
added, putting a bold front on it. "I see your car out there,
empty."</p>
<p>"Yes, why don't you give the poor young man a ride?" Mrs.
Cotesham chipped in, lowering the speaking trumpet from her ear.
"Fancy wanting all that great car to yourself! I hate
selfishness."</p>
<p>Mr. Grant smiled.</p>
<p>"I couldn't persuade you, my dear lady----" he began.</p>
<p>"No, you couldn't!" she interrupted vigorously. "I wouldn't
step inside your old car if you paid me. I'm not going your way,
either. I'm going to Clifton. And I hope that as long as I live
I'll never set eyes upon your repulsive face again."</p>
<p>Mr. Grant lifted his hat solemnly.</p>
<p>"Amen!" he said. "Come on, young fellow," he added gruffly.
"I'll take you to London as long as you promise not to try and
sing to me."</p>
<p>I spared my benefactor any exuberant show of gratitude, but I
felt that I was in luck's way<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> as I stretched myself
out in the luxuriously cushioned seat of Mr. Grant's limousine.
We swung off along the Bristol road.</p>
<p>"Got to call at a house three miles out on this road," Mr.
Grant explained thickly. "We'll be in London before the fastest
of them, though."</p>
<p>"It's quite immaterial to me so long as we get there by this
evening," I answered.</p>
<p>We drove on for between three and four miles. Then, without
any order from Mr. Grant, the car came to a standstill by the
side of the road. I looked at my companion for some explanation.
He was leaning a little forward, with both hands clasped around
the knob of his stick. His attitude was one of listening.</p>
<p>"Is the house where you want to call near here?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Listen!" was the brusque reply.</p>
<p>I thrust my head out of the window of the car and held my
breath. Climbing the hill behind us, hidden by the mist, was
another car, puffing and snorting as though in some difficulties.
It came into sight in a minute or<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> two--a Bath taxicab,
laden with luggage. Mr. Grant descended.</p>
<p>"Something wrong with that engine," he remarked. "Perhaps we
had better enquire if we can help."</p>
<p>The car behind had come to a standstill, and the chauffeur,
who had already jumped from his place and opened the bonnet, was
tinkering with his engine. I fancied that a glance of
intelligence passed between him and Mr. Grant.</p>
<p>"Dear me," the latter exclaimed, turning around and finding me
at his heels. "Our amiable old friend on her way to Bristol! We
must see whether we cannot be of some assistance."</p>
<p>What followed--the rapidity and the wonder of it--kept me
spellbound. There was no stump about Mr. Grant as he threw open
the door of the taxicab. His spring was the spring of a young
man, and before I could realise what was happening, he had Mrs.
Cotesham by the throat. With the other hand he passed out to me
the box which she had been using as a footstool.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg
86]</a></span>"The game's up, Kinlosti," he said, and the voice
was the voice of Thomson. "I'll shake the life out of you if you
reach for that pistol."</p>
<p>For a moment I stood in the middle of the road, spellbound.
The pseudo Mrs. Cotesham was a wonderful sight. Her false front
and mass of grey curls had slipped over her ear, disclosing the
clean-shaven head of a young man. The paint was cracking upon her
face. Thomson's terrible grip seemed to be slowly strangling her,
and slowly from out of the wreck there seemed to creep another
face, the face of a man with Kinlosti's haunting eyes. He seemed
to wrench himself at that moment a little freer from the cruel
grip upon his windpipe, and a cry of terror rang out into the
mist, the thrilling, horrible cry of a man in fear of his life.
The cry was stifled by something which Thomson held in his hand.
He turned to me.</p>
<p>"Get back in the car and take that box with you," he
directed.</p>
<p>I obeyed him, glad enough to be away from whatever else might
happen. In a minute or two Mr. Thomson returned. He gave a
brief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg
87]</a></span> order to the chauffeur, the car swung round, and
we headed once more for Bath. As we flashed past the taxicab, I
caught a momentary glimpse of its amazing occupant, leaning
forward, his face buried in his hands. The taxicab man had lit a
cigarette and was waiting apparently for orders.</p>
<p>"Sha'n't we be stopped?" I asked my companion. "He can
telephone."</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson shook his head.</p>
<p>"The game isn't played that way," he said shortly.</p>
<p>Whereupon he put his feet on the opposite cushion and either
slept or pretended to sleep until we reached Hungerford. Then he
yawned and looked at me.</p>
<p>"Can you hold out until we reach London?" he asked. "I don't
want to stop for luncheon."</p>
<p>"Easily," I replied. "I had a good breakfast, and to tell you
the truth," I added boldly, "I'm too curious to be hungry."</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson yawned and closed his eyes again.</p>
<p>"You can keep your curiosity and your<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
appetite, too, if you like," he said, "until eight o'clock this
evening, Milan Restaurant--not Grill Room."</p>
<p>"All three of us?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson closed his eyes, and not another word was spoken
until he set me down at the Mayfair Hotel.</p>
<h3>* * * * *</h3>
<p>It was evidently not only at hotels that Mr. Thomson was
<i>persona grata</i>. The table to which he led us on our arrival
at the Milan was one of the best in the room. The chief
<i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> himself was in attendance to
exchange amenities with an evidently well-known and respected
patron. The menu of a specially prepared dinner was deferentially
handed to him by one of the minor luminaries. We seated ourselves
with some faint return of that unreal feeling which had been
evoked by the two previous feasts at which we had assisted. This
one especially was hard to realise. Nowhere could the
appurtenances of luxury have been more elaborately displayed.
Pink, hothouse roses almost covered the tablecloth<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> and
gave a faint, exotic odour to the restful atmosphere of the room.
Outside, the orchestra was playing with subdued and melodious
cadence the music of "Louise." We seemed in an oasis, in a world
far removed from the tragedies of the day.</p>
<p>"I fear," our host said, as he watched the wine being poured
into Rose's glass, "that your journey up to-day has fatigued you.
I beg that you will drink half a glass of that wine at once.
There is nothing so refreshing as champagne after a long motor
ride."</p>
<p>"It wasn't the distance," Rose replied, as she followed his
advice. "It was Mr. Kinlosti's extraordinary behaviour. I have
never seen a man so nervous in all my life. He could not sit
still. He seemed to lose sometimes almost the power of speech.
Always he seemed to be expecting something which never
happened."</p>
<p>"Ah!" Mr. Thomson murmured. "That is not to be wondered
at."</p>
<p>"When we neared London," Rose continued, "and I ventured to
congratulate him upon the near fulfilment of his trust, I
cer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg
90]</a></span>tainly thought he would have hysterics. We left him
at Hammersmith, telephoning wildly. After waiting half an hour,
we moved our things into a taxi."</p>
<p>"Things did not turn out," Mr. Thomson reflected, "exactly as
Mr. Kinlosti had anticipated."</p>
<p>"It has been your custom, sir," I reminded him, leaning
forward in my place, "on the occasion of these little
celebrations, to vouchsafe us some slight inkling as to the
meaning of our efforts. I feel that we should do more justice to
this wonderful dinner if you could give us some faint idea as to
the nature of the tragedy, or farce, or whatever it may be, at
which we have been assisting."</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson ruminated for a moment. He seemed to be watching
two unobtrusive-looking men, still in morning dress, who were
making their way through the room towards the more retired tables
set out on the balcony.</p>
<p>"That is true," he admitted. "I will tell you, then, a little
history. It may perhaps bring some part of the colour back to
Miss Mindel's cheeks."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg
91]</a></span>"It may also," I observed, "stop me from thinking I
can see two of everything."</p>
<p>"A month ago," Mr. Thomson said, "there landed in England
three of the greatest rascals who ever drew breath in any
country. One was Andrea Kinlosti, at one time valet and barber to
the Tsar of Russia. The other was Paul Kinlosti, his brother, an
actor of some small note in a stock company at St. Petersburg.
The third was a hardened criminal, whom, not to confuse you, we
will call John, wanted even in his own country for something like
thirteen murders. Andrea Kinlosti was the gentleman, Miss Rose,
who brought you to London to-day. Paul Kinlosti, the actor, gave
a very wonderful rendering of Mrs. Cotesham. And John--well, you
know about him."</p>
<p>"Andrea Kinlosti's story, then," Rose began----</p>
<p>"A tissue of lies," our host interrupted. "The true facts
about his appearance in England are these. A very valuable
portion of the Crown jewels was hidden by one of the Monarchist
party in St. Petersburg. Partly through Andrea Kinlosti's
intervention, these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id=
"Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> jewels fell into the hands of the
Bolshevists. The two Kinlostis and John, however, managed to
secure possession of them and escaped to England. Hard on their
heels came four or five of their kidney, and the attempt you saw
at theft at the Crown Hotel was the third or fourth which has
been made since they arrived in this country. In the absence of
any extradition treaty between the present Government of Russia
and this country, the trio thought that they would be safe here
and could make their plans to realise the jewels. They did not
count, however, upon the little stream of fellow rascals who
found their way over here after them. The Bath idea seems
fantastic, but on the whole it had its points. Andrea was really
suffering horribly from rheumatism, and an hotel of the class of
the Crown seemed as good a hiding place as any from the kind of
person whom they desired to avoid. The scheme was that Kinlosti
should be quite frank about his possession of the jewels, but the
box which was supposed to contain them was a dummy. Paul, the
actor, impersonated an old lady and was really in<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
possession of the jewels, and the idea was that he should watch
his opportunity and take steamer direct from Bristol to some
little port at which he could reship to New York."</p>
<p>We murmured comprehension.</p>
<p>"Miss Mindel here," Thomson continued, "kept admirably in
touch with Andrea Kinlosti, the pseudo-nobleman. She was able to
give me the information I desired, as to which of the two really
possessed the jewels. Furthermore, directly Andrea sought her
companionship for the journey to London, I knew that it was Paul
who was to have the jewels. Upon the whole," he concluded, "for
two arch criminals of wonderful reputation, I think their final
attempt to get away with the booty was a little
disappointing."</p>
<p>"What has happened to them?" Rose asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson picked up the evening paper which he had placed by
the side of his plate.</p>
<p>"This is just a telegram," he observed, turning to the stop
press news:</p>
<br>
<p class="newspaper">Just before the sailing of the S. S.
<i>Avonmouth</i> from Bristol this afternoon, the body of an
elderly lady, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id=
"Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> booked a passage to Jamaica in the
name of Mrs. Cotesham, was found in her cabin. It is feared that
the deceased lady was the victim of foul play, as there were
marks of strangulation upon her throat, and her property had
apparently been rifled</p>
<p class="newspaper">LATER.</p>
<p class="newspaper">Further extraordinary revelations concerning
the murder on the <i>Avonmouth</i> have just come to hand, from
which it appears that the deceased was a man in woman's
clothes.</p>
<br>
<p>"What made him go on?" I asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson smiled.</p>
<p>"A little information I whispered to him," he said,
"concerning the movements of some of his cutthroat friends from
Russia. They were hard on his track, as this paragraph
proves."</p>
<p>"And what about--the other one?" Rose asked, in a stifled,
breathless voice--"the one I travelled up with?"</p>
<p>"Andrea," Mr. Thomson replied. "I am afraid, Miss Mindel, that
he is a very bad lot indeed. If I had not been sure that
your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg
95]</a></span> protection was adequate, I should certainly have
hesitated before I asked you to play Delilah."</p>
<p>"I am still wondering," Rose murmured, "what has become of
him."</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson had been watching the progress of three men
through the crowded restaurant. By a silent gesture he invited
her attention to them. The foremost figure was the man whom we
had known as Andrea Kinlosti, behind him the two
unobtrusive-looking men who had passed through the restaurant a
few minutes before. Kinlosti looked neither to the right nor to
the left; his cheeks were ashen pale, his dark eyes more
brilliant and sunken than ever. The two men who followed watched
his every movement with catlike intensity. When they had passed
into the lounge, they drew one on either side of him.</p>
<p>"He is in luck," Mr. Thomson said grimly. "Scotland Yard has a
pretty black record against him since his last visit to England,
six or seven years ago, but if it had been the others--I don't
think they would have been so kind to him as they were to his
brother. And now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id=
"Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> that's the end of my story," he went
on, in an altered tone. "Miss Mindel, I am assured that this
young turkey is as tender as the chestnut stuffing. Lister, you
ought to have an appetite, for I did you out of your lunch.
Cotton, a glass of wine with you."</p>
<p>I think that a certain callousness, born of our recent
adventures, was finding its way into our natures, for each one of
us responded cheerfully to our host's invitation. There was
one--the great question--however, which I could not refrain from
asking.</p>
<p>"About those jewels, sir--where are they?" I asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson scratched his chin.</p>
<p>"Young man," he replied, "don't you think you'd be better off
without knowing where half a million pounds' worth of jewels
are?"</p>
<p>"That isn't what I meant," I persisted. "You seem to have
recovered them from the original thieves. What are you going to
do about it?"</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson smiled.</p>
<p>"Let me see," he observed, "that will be Conundrum Number

<h2>CONUNDRUM #3.&mdash;THE SPIDER'S PARLOUR</h2>
<h3>First published in <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, Jan 1921</h3>
<p class="first">We three--Leonard Cotton, Rose Mindel and I,
Maurice Lister, who comprised the much-advertised little troupe
of English artistes recently arrived at Brussels--sipped the very
excellent black coffee provided for our delectation by Monsieur
Huber, the proprietor of the Quatres Etoiles, gazed around with
interest at the motley crowd by which we were surrounded,
applauded the performance of a little French soubrette upon the
stage with all the abandon required by fellow artistes, and
exchanged mutual smiles of well-being and content. To tell the
truth, the Caf&eacute; des Quatres Etoiles, its clientele, and
the character of the entertainment provided were nothing so very
wonderful, but it was our first glimpse of foreign life for some
five or six years. We were young and athirst for adventure,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg
98]</a></span> with our unseen patron behind us we were pretty
certain that before long we should be brought into touch with
interesting things. So far we had spent a week in Brussels, and
no word had followed the mandate which had sent us there. We had
been perfectly content, however, to wait our time and take our
nightly part in the performances. Rose had made quite a hit with
her topical songs and graceful dancing. Leonard's droll stories
were much appreciated by an audience which during the last four
years had received a mighty English lesson. My own baritone songs
were well enough received, and we thoroughly enjoyed the
cosmopolitan habit established at the little music hall of coming
down to one of the tables in the caf&eacute; between our turns
and taking our place amongst the audience. Rose was somewhat of a
responsibility to us, but since the affair Kinlosti she had
shunned all new acquaintances and was quite content that we
should play the part of watchdogs. Even as we sat there that
evening, she received with the pleasant indifference of the true
artiste many admiring, many inviting glances.
Prosperity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id=
"Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> had agreed with Rose, as I suppose
it had also with Leonard and me. The slight thinness of her face,
the discontented curl of the lips, had vanished. Her cheeks had
filled out, those wonderful blue eyes of hers seemed always soft
and full of life. She had a perpetual and distracting smile upon
her lips; she moved as one who walks on air. "The little lady,"
Monsieur Huber had said to us on the evening of our first
performance, "has the gaiety of Paris. It is incredible that she
is of London. She makes happiness wherever she goes." And, by the
bye, Mr. Huber was not accustomed to overpraise any artiste to
whom he was in the habit of paying a salary.</p>
<p>"Maurice--and you, old solemn-face," Rose said, turning to
Leonard, "I like this place. I am prepared to enjoy myself here.
I am more glad than ever that I sold my soul."</p>
<p>"I am entirely with you," Leonard assented, "so long as the
future does not present any such penalties as the incarceration
of the body."</p>
<p>"You're all right," I reminded him. "I'm the person who nearly
found trouble. A few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id=
"Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> more paragraphs about that
mysterious jewel robbery and the probability of immediate arrest
would have sent me into a nervous decline."</p>
<p>Rose laughed in my face, her white teeth gleaming. The little
creases at the corners of her eyes deepened.</p>
<p>"Rubbish!" she scoffed. "You know perfectly well that you
never turned a hair."</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact," I admitted, "I am beginning to have
confidence in Mr. Mephistopheles Thomson. Whether he is of heaven
or earth, of the law or of the underworld, he seems to have a
remarkably good idea of how to take care of himself and his
minions."</p>
<p>"Considering that he has three perfectly good consciences to
look after besides his own," Rose agreed, "I must say that he
does very well."</p>
<p>"His interests appear to be somewhat cosmopolitan," Leonard
observed, leaning back in his chair and gazing around him.</p>
<p>"So much the better," Rose declared. "It means plenty of
change for us, and I like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101"
id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> change, only this time I hope
my affections are not going to be trifled with."</p>
<p>"You shouldn't wear your heart on your sleeve for sentimental
Russians to nibble at," I ventured.</p>
<p>She made a little grimace. I fancy I should have been the
recipient of a scathing remark but for the approach of Monsieur
Huber, the proprietor of the caf&eacute;. He bowed with great
politeness to Rose and handed me a typewritten envelope of
familiar appearance. I tore it open and glanced at its brief
contents:</p>
<br>
<p class="note" style="text-align:left"><tt>I beg that you will
respond to any advances made to you by any regular patrons of the
Caf&eacute; des Quatres Etoiles.</tt></p>
<br>
<p>I held the note out so that the two others could read it. Then
I thrust it into my pocket.</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle sang charmingly to-night," Monsieur Huber
declared, rolling his eyes.</p>
<p>"I didn't see you amongst the audience, Monsieur Huber," she
replied demurely.</p>
<p>"When you sing I am never far away, Mademoiselle," was the
impressive response. "I was standing at the back of the Baroness
Spens' box."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg
102]</a></span>Rose glanced upwards at the box which he
indicated. A large woman was seated there, dressed in an
elaborate evening gown, with jewels sparkling from her bosom and
hair. She was dark, with a strong masculine face, a woman who had
once, beyond a doubt, been handsome, but whose countenance was
now almost forbidding. I recognised her as one of the regular
patrons of the caf&eacute;.</p>
<p>"The Baroness," Monsieur Huber continued, "is one of my best
clients. She is very good to all my artistes. Sometimes she has
them at her home. She pays, too--pays very well. But excuse
me--she calls."</p>
<p>The Baroness, with a short, rather thick-set Belgian girl, and
a fat, elderly man, who had almost fallen on to the stage
applauding the little French soubrette, occupied the stage box,
which was on a level with the promenade. Monsieur Huber hurried
over towards it, exchanged a few words with his patroness and
returned to us.</p>
<p>"The Baroness desires that you three will visit her box and
take a glass of wine," he announced, with the air of one
conveying a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id=
"Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> royal command. "Fran&ccedil;ois, a
bottle of <i>34</i> to the stage box at once."</p>
<p>Apart from our desire to oblige little Mr. Huber, who was
really a most good-natured person, our recently received mandate
left us no alternative but to comply. We were ushered, therefore,
into the box, where the Baroness received us, rather to my
surprise, with the air of a woman of breeding, the girl without
any special enthusiasm, and the old man, whose eyes were glued
upon the soubrette, with indifference. We were offered chairs and
suffered the martyrdom of sweet champagne. The Baroness said
polite things about our performance, enquired about our
impressions of Brussels, and spoke calmly of her residence in the
city during the period of German occupation. Her conversation was
easy enough, and gracious, yet I could not get it out of my head
that her interest in us did not arise solely from the fact of our
being professional entertainers.</p>
<p>"You find it pays," she asked, a little abruptly, "while
living in Brussels is so dear,<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> to perform at this
caf&eacute; for Monsieur Huber's salary?"</p>
<p>"Financially," I admitted, "our trip here is not particularly
remunerative, but we were all three very anxious to get over here
and look around."</p>
<p>"You find it very changed--the city?"</p>
<p>"Only as regards the absence of Germans," I replied. "In the
old days one met them everywhere."</p>
<p>"They will return," she observed.</p>
<p>"But surely they will not be welcome guests?" I ventured.</p>
<p>"Not at first," she answered indifferently. "Brussels,
however, is too cosmopolitan and too near the frontier to
preserve her isolation. The intermarrying alone would prevent any
ostracism."</p>
<p>"I hope," I ventured to say, "that they will keep away until
our stay here is over."</p>
<p>She glanced at my stiff left arm.</p>
<p>"You lost that in the War?"</p>
<p>"That and better things," I told her--"a brother, two cousins
and an uncle."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg
105]</a></span>She nodded gravely yet with little pretence at
sympathy.</p>
<p>"You English were wonderful," she said coldly.</p>
<p>The little fat man, who had been leaning over the edge of the
box, suddenly turned around, mopping his forehead. He was not a
pleasant sight to look upon. There were wine stains upon his
shirt front and cigar ash upon his waistcoat. His cheeks were
pale and puffy; there were bags underneath his eyes. His grey
beard and moustache, though carefully trimmed, were scanty and
unprepossessing.</p>
<p>"But she is wonderful, that little one," he declared.
"Marvellous!"</p>
<p>He poured out a glass of wine, ignoring us in his ecstasy. The
Baroness endeavoured to correct his manners.</p>
<p>"You were unfortunate, dear Henri," she said, "that you
arrived too late to hear Mademoiselle Mindel sing and to watch
her dance. You would have thought less of your little French
girl's performance."</p>
<p>Monsieur Henri recovered himself sufficiently to bow to
Rose.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg
106]</a></span>"It will be my pleasure another evening," he said.
"Meanwhile, dear Baroness, if you will excuse me. Mademoiselle
expects me. We shall meet again."</p>
<p>He made us a comprehensive bow and departed. The phlegmatic
young woman, who had been introduced to us as Mademoiselle
Trudens, muttered something in Flemish as he left the box. The
Baroness shook her head reprovingly.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Henri Destin," she pronounced, "is a person of
importance. One must humour his whims."</p>
<p>Leonard glanced at his watch and rose.</p>
<p>"I fear that I must be excused, Baroness," he regretted. "My
turn to sing is close at hand."</p>
<p>We also rose. The Baroness eyed us reflectively.</p>
<p>"I am having a few friends out to supper to-night at my
chateau," she said. "It will give me great pleasure if you will
come after the performance. My car will be at the stage door at
half-past eleven, and I shall send you back to your hotel."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg
107]</a></span>Her thoughtful hesitation before extending the
invitation had been so apparent that we should never have dreamed
of accepting it but for our mandate. As it was, we had no
alternative. We professed ourselves delighted, and were permitted
to depart.</p>
<h3>* * * * *</h3>
<p>The automobile which awaited us at the stage door at the
conclusion of the performance, and which contained our
prospective hostess only, was the swiftest and most luxurious in
which we had any of us ever ridden. We passed over several miles
of cobbled streets with incredible speed, penetrated some
distance into the country, and finally turned in at an avenue
which led through a dense wood and terminated in front of a
chateau, finely situated and of imposing proportions. Even as we
descended, however, a curious fact concerning it occurred both to
Leonard and myself. The Baroness, who must have been watching us
more closely than I had imagined, surprised me by referring to
it.</p>
<p>"You are wondering why half my chateau is illuminated and the
remainder is in darkness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108"
id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> is it not so?" she enquired.
"Well, I will tell you. The portion which you see in darkness was
the headquarters of the most detested German who ever set foot in
this country during the enemy occupation of the city. Since his
departure, I have not yet been able to accustom myself to the
existence of apartments in which he and his suite lived and
breathed."</p>
<p>She spoke with a little undernote of passion, waited for no
comment from us, but led the way into the brightly lit hall,
where servants relieved us of our wraps and we were at once made
conscious of an air of luxury and comfort. The apartment into
which we were presently shown was almost stately in its
proportions, and as a pleasure room almost unique. At one end was
a little raised stage for theatrical performances, occupied now
by a small orchestra; and fitted into the wall was an electric
organ. There was a considerable space of polished floor for
dancing, and at the opposite end of the apartment a large round
table laid for supper.</p>
<p>"I fear," the Baroness confided, "that my apartment resembles
too much a restaurant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109"
id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> Still, what can one do? My
friends love dancing informally, the men love their supper, and
this huge apartment, which was built for a music room, would be
wasted if I used it in any other fashion. We have a custom here
which always prevails. Supper is served at 12.30. As guests
arrive, they seat themselves."</p>
<p>"We shall find no difficulty in accommodating ourselves to
your delightful customs," I assured her, as we took the places
she indicated. "One must dine at six while our present engagement
is on, and it seems a long time ago."</p>
<p>The precise character of that entertainment, the status of the
guests who presently arrived, and the significance of the whole
affair to us personally puzzled us all for a long time. Several
beautiful ladies arrived, of apparently satisfactory social
position, not possessed of a universal desire to attach
themselves to something responsive amongst the male sex. Madame
Sara Cl&egrave;ry, of the French Opera Company, a cousin of our
hostess, was kind enough to show a marked interest in me and my
presence in Brussels.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg
110]</a></span>"Tell me, Monsieur," she begged, in her very
attractive undertone, as we sat in a corner after a waltz, "why
are you really in Brussels? You tell me that you perform at the
Caf&eacute; des Quatres Etoiles, but that is a joke, is it
not?"</p>
<p>"Nothing of the sort, indeed, Madame," I assured her. "I am
there on a short engagement with my two friends. I am merely what
we call in English a strolling mountebank."</p>
<p>"You had no other reason, then, for coming to Brussels?" she
persisted.</p>
<p>"Unless I was subconsciously aware of the joy in store for me
in meeting Madame," I answered, "there was no other reason."</p>
<p>"Or in coming to this house?'"</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>"The Baroness was good enough to ask us all," I explained,
"and Monsieur Huber likes his artistes to accept the hospitality
of his patrons."</p>
<p>She pouted a little.</p>
<p>"You do not treat me with confidence, Monsieur," she
complained, "and I am your wellwisher."</p>
<p>"Madame," I replied, "if you would search<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> my
heart, which, alas! is in your possession, you would realise that
I don't understand a word of what you are talking about."</p>
<p>She laughed as though but half convinced. We danced again,
drank wine together, and talked a great deal of nonsense. All the
time I kept my eye on Rose, who found many partners and seemed to
be enjoying the evening exceedingly. As the night wore on, I
thought it was almost time for a counterattack.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Madame," I begged, as we sat enjoying a cigarette in
a remote corner of the room, "what made you think that I might
have other affairs in Brussels?"</p>
<p>She looked at me meditatively. I could see that she had not as
yet made up her mind about me.</p>
<p>"There are so many," she said, "who come to Brussels for
another purpose."</p>
<p>"But what purpose?"</p>
<p>We were resting in a deep window seat. She drew aside the
curtains for a moment. Before us stretched the black, unlit wing
of the chateau.</p>
<p>"Just that, monsieur," she whispered.<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg
112]</a></span></p>
<p>"Come, we dance again. This is the waltz we both love."</p>
<p>And after that, Madame would dance but she would not talk. So
we all went back to our rooms in the Hotel de l'Univers more than
a little puzzled.</p>
<p>Things began to shape themselves on the following day, when
Monsieur Huber handed me another typewritten communication. My
instructions were concise but a trifle embarrassing:</p>
<br>
<p class="note" style="text-align:left"><tt>Cultivate Madame Sara
Cl&egrave;ry. She is at home from five to seven. At all hazards
be there on Thursday. Leave report of visit with Monsieur Huber,
addressed Thomson.</tt></p>
<br>
<p>Rose made a little grimace as she read over my shoulder.</p>
<p>"Perhaps," she exclaimed, with her head in the air, "you won't
have so much to say about poor Mr. Kinlosti now."</p>
<p>"This isn't of my seeking, is it?" I protested.</p>
<p>"Nor was L'Affaire Kinlosti mine," she retorted. "There was a
wonderful little Belgian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113"
id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> Count, with moustaches half an
inch long, the other night. I shall let him call upon me."</p>
<p>"I shall leave you in Leonard's charge," I replied
stiffly.</p>
<p>"Dear old Len!" she mocked. "He won't have an earthly chance
if I take it into my head to be frisky, and I'm sure I shall. It
isn't natural for a girl to see no men except two ogres of
guardians."</p>
<p>"You be thankful you've got us to look after you," Leonard
intervened. "From what I've seen of this city, Sodom and Gomorrah
weren't in it for levity."</p>
<p>"I can take care of myself," Rose declared, tossing her
head.</p>
<p>"Perhaps," I replied. "In the meantime, when I am away on
duty--on duty, mind you--Leonard is going to play watchdog."</p>
<p>She dropped a little curtsey to both of us.</p>
<p>"One would think that I were a masquerading princess," she
observed.</p>
<p>"You're our princess," I answered quickly.</p>
<p>The peevishness passed from her face in a moment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg
114]</a></span>"If only you'd tell me so sometimes!" she
murmured.</p>
<p>I was at no time quite able to make up my mind how Sara
Cl&egrave;ry really regarded my visits. On the first day, she
received my present of roses and my compliments with unmistakable
pleasure. On the second day, she was still amiable but a little
puzzled. On the third day she received me with greater intimacy
than ever before, and I was never so relieved as when the
opportune arrival of one of her regular admirers--the tenor with
whom she was singing--enabled me to beat a graceful retreat. On
the fourth afternoon, the specially indicated Thursday, I found
her in a state of agitation. It is my confident belief that on
that occasion, but for my <i>douceur</i> to her maid, which
ensured my prompt entry, I should have been denied admission. She
welcomed me with mingled affection--simulated--and suspicion.
There was no return of her previous day's attitude.</p>
<p>"You find me distracted," she declared presently. "A terrible
tragedy has happened."</p>
<p>I murmured a word or two of sympathy.<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
She looked at me earnestly, as though anxious to probe my mind,
to assure herself of my sincerity.</p>
<p>"If I dared to confide in you!" she murmured.</p>
<p>"Dear Sara," I ventured--we had progressed so far--"what is to
prevent it? You know that I am your slave."</p>
<p>She drew a dispatch from the bosom of her gown.</p>
<p>"Listen," she said. "There is a secret in my life which has
troubled me many times--more than ever," she murmured, dropping
her eyes, "since I have known you."</p>
<p>I did not hesitate to play her game, because in my mind I knew
that she was deceiving me.</p>
<p>"Tell me?" I begged. "I am impatient to hear."</p>
<p>"There is one in my family," she continued, "who is a
criminal."</p>
<p>"What does that matter," I answered, "so long as it is not
you?"</p>
<p>"You feel like that, Maurice?" she exclaimed earnestly.</p>
<p>"Indeed I do," I assured her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg
116]</a></span>"You are English," she went on. "You fought in the
War for Belgium's deliverance. The halo of heroism still rests
around your head. You can do what others dared not. Listen. This
telegram is from my brother. He has escaped from prison in
Antwerp. Never mind the charge. The police search for him
everywhere, but he promises that he will reach my flat at ten
o'clock to-night."</p>
<p>"In disguise?"</p>
<p>"He comes as the victim of a motor accident, in an ambulance
car, his face bandaged. But here--how can I keep him here! The
Chief of the Police is amongst my intimates. There are people
coming and going all day."</p>
<p>"You have a suggestion?" I ventured.</p>
<p>"Yes," she answered. "I was at the Caf&eacute; des Quatres
Etoiles when you did your imitations the other night. You have a
wonderful gift of making up. My cousin has undertaken to hide
Albert at the chateau, if we can get him there. Good! You must
come here, make up my brother, say, to imitate your friend
Monsieur Cotton, whom he is not unlike. Then you drive out to the
chateau quite openly to one of<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> my cousin's supper
parties. Albert will disappear and all will be well."</p>
<p>"And when is this to be?" I asked.</p>
<p>"To-night," she answered. "You consent?"</p>
<p>She leaned towards me. I hesitated merely out of policy. Her
lips almost touched my cheek.</p>
<p>"You have perhaps a price, a reward to ask?" she murmured.</p>
<p>I knew then that I was in love with Rose, if I had ever
doubted it. I have always flattered myself that I displayed great
presence of mind.</p>
<p>"Sara," I said, giving a very excellent extempore performance
of British stupidity and magnanimity combined, "I ask for no
reward beforehand. I wait till the task is done."</p>
<p>I was vain enough to think that she was almost disappointed.
She brushed my cheek with her lips and murmured in my ear.</p>
<p>"You shall not be the loser, Maurice. At eleven o'clock
to-night you will come? I am not singing and you must finish
early."</p>
<p>"At eleven o'clock," I promised.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg
118]</a></span>That evening I wrote my report and left it with
Monsieur Huber, and at eleven o'clock, with my make-up outfit, I
presented myself at Madame Cl&egrave;ry's flat. She herself
opened the door and detained me for a moment in the hall.</p>
<p>"All is well, so far," she murmured. "Albert arrived in a
motor ambulance, all bandaged up. We are alone in the flat. If he
is a little nervous, you will forgive him."</p>
<p>She led me into the sitting room. A man of medium height, thin
and with a hard, square face, rose from an easy-chair, and turned
a half-enquiring, half-suspicious gaze upon me. I was thankful
then for the obscurity of the room, no longer ashamed of my
deceit, a willing coadjutor in this scheme, whatever it might be.
I knew, too, why my services were so earnestly required. The
photographer's art had made the face before me infamous.</p>
<p>"This is Monsieur Lister," Sara said. "He has promised to
disguise you, Albert."</p>
<p>"Let him be quick about it, then," was the harsh reply.</p>
<p>I never had a more distasteful task, but in the end I
succeeded. I concealed the cruel<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> mouth and softened
the brutal jaw, until at last a very passable imitation of
Leonard appeared. Sara was loud in her praises and exuberant in
her gratitude. Her pseudo-brother did nothing save make my task
more difficult by his irritation and impatience. In the end, when
all was finished, I handed him an overcoat of Leonard's which I
had brought, and we three started out in a large motor car, which
was waiting below, for the chateau. We arrived there a little
before the accustomed hour for Madame's reception, and the whole
place seemed dark and deserted. A strange manservant let us in
and disappeared almost immediately. The Baroness came out of the
shadows. She, too, seemed affected by the tragedy of the moment.
Her cheeks were unusually pale. Her almost Flemish stolidity had
disappeared.</p>
<p>"The passages are unlocked," she whispered. "Let us go
quickly. In half an hour there may be people who arrive."</p>
<p>She led the way up the broad staircase. I hesitated, but Sara
thrust her arm through mine.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg
120]</a></span>"We trust you," she said. "You must come with
us."</p>
<p>Arrived on the first floor, we traversed what seemed to be an
interminable corridor until we came at last to a green baize door
which, on being swung open, revealed an inner one, which the
Baroness unlocked. Immediately I was conscious that we were in
the uninhabited part of the chateau. The Baroness, who was in
front, came to a stop and we all paused.</p>
<p>"We make a mistake," she said in a low tone. "There is no
place here for strangers."</p>
<p>She inclined her head towards me. The man laughed a little
brutally.</p>
<p>"Stranger or not," he replied, "do you think I am going to let
him go until this little affair is finished?"</p>
<p>"And after then, what about us?" the Baroness demanded.
"Safety, with you, is a matter of an hour or so, but we
remain."</p>
<p>"Bah!" was the contemptuous reply. "He will not inform against
women. Sara will see to that."</p>
<p>I felt that it was time I had a word to say on my own
account.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg
121]</a></span>"On the whole," I decided, "I have seen as much as
I care to of these proceedings. I will find my way back again and
await your return, Baroness."</p>
<p>The man laughed scornfully. No art of mine could conceal the
scowl which disfigured his face.</p>
<p>"Too late, Mr. Englishman," he said. "You know too much.
Remain where you are."</p>
<p>I looked down the muzzle of a particularly unpleasant-looking
revolver, which instinct told me the man at the other end would
not hesitate to use. At the same time I heard the sharp click of
the door being closed behind me.</p>
<p>"Quite unnecessary," I declared, waving my hand towards the
revolver. "If you wish me to stay, I am entirely at your service.
In fact, to tell you the truth," I went on, "I am beginning to
feel a certain amount of curiosity about this enterprise."</p>
<p>Sara's reputed brother laughed harshly.</p>
<p>"You'll have time to get over that," he said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg
122]</a></span>Warned by his tone, Sara stepped out of the
shadows of the room.</p>
<p>"He is not to be hurt!" she exclaimed. "That was a
promise."</p>
<p>There was silence. The room in which we were was unlit save by
the little points of fire from the electric torches carried by
the Baroness and her companion. There was something sinister in
the sound of their soft breathing against the background of deep
and solemn stillness. Suddenly a tongue of light flashed from
Sara's own torch. I saw then that the others were too much
engrossed to be even considering my fate. With a tape measure in
his hand, the man was tapping certain places upon the wall.
Presently he made a mark with a pencil and turned around. His
face was livid with excitement.</p>
<p>"Nothing seems to have been touched here," he muttered.</p>
<p>"Nothing has been touched," the Baroness assented calmly.
"Other rooms, as you know, have been ransacked, the grounds have
been dug up, and the tower almost pulled to pieces. But here,
where you sat in state and pulled<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> the legs out of the
spiders' bodies and the souls out of your poor human victims,
well, no one has thought of looking here."</p>
<p>The man chuckled, but there was a certain malevolent
uneasiness in his expression as he stared at the speaker.</p>
<p>"My victims were not all unwilling, eh?" he demanded.</p>
<p>The Baroness had been feeling along the wall. She touched a
switch, and a dull glow of light shone through a dust-encrusted
globe set in the ceiling.</p>
<p>"There is still a connection," she said. "It is better so? You
need have no fear. The shutters are tightly closed. No one will
know that human beings have dared to penetrate into the spider's
parlour."</p>
<p>I had my first comprehensive view of the room--a bare,
official-looking apartment, with a huge writing table near the
window, a heap of empty champagne bottles and cigar boxes in one
corner. There was dust everywhere. It seemed, indeed, as though
the room might not have been opened for many months.</p>
<p>"You need have no fear," the Baroness re<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg
124]</a></span>peated. "The shutters are fast closed. You can
look around on the scene of your former triumphs. The telephone
wires have been cut. Nothing else has been altered."</p>
<p>They stood facing one another, the man and the woman. From my
point of vantage in the background, I was conscious of a subtle
change in the Baroness. The cold stolidity, almost woodenness of
her deportment, had gone. Her lips were parted a little, and
there was something menacing in the gleam of her white teeth. Her
eyes held expression, expression which I could not analyse. She
seemed to bristle with sensation. The man who faced her had
become uneasy.</p>
<p>"We talk too much," he muttered. "It is enough for me that you
have obeyed my orders and left all here untouched."</p>
<p>"It is true," she acknowledged. "Searchers have almost wrecked
this wing of the chateau and destroyed my grounds, in search of
your spoil, but this bare little room--no! It seemed so harmless,
so empty, and besides, there were many who shuddered to come near
it."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg
125]</a></span>He busied himself once more with the wall.
Suddenly he took a knife from his pocket and cut down a great
strip of the wall paper. A little cry of triumph broke from his
lips. His fingers seemed to feel a crack. He pushed and tugged
till the sweat ran down his face. Finally, with a rumble, a
sliding door opened to the extent of about a foot. He paused to
gain breath and turned back to the Baroness with a leer of
triumph.</p>
<p>"Your treasure hunters were but simpletons," he scoffed. "They
saw as far as the end of their noses."</p>
<p>He seemed to become suddenly conscious that no one was looking
at him. We were all staring at that gradually widening aperture
in the wall, staring at the menacing figure which had
unexpectedly appeared there. The man on whose behalf we had
embarked upon this expedition swung abruptly around. His lips
opened but no sound came. He stood shaking and choking. Mr.
Thomson, wiping the dust from his clothes, stepped into the
room.</p>
<p>"Excellently timed," he said, nodding pleasantly at me.
"Count----"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg
126]</a></span>The trapped man's recovery was amazing. I doubt
whether Mr. Thomson, quick though he was, would have escaped the
bullet from that suddenly upraised revolver, but for the
Baroness. I have never before nor since looked upon anything so
marvellous as her swift action. She struck his arm such a blow
that we heard the cracking of the bone, caught him by the
shoulders as though he had been a boy, flung him on to the floor,
and was there with her hand upon his throat, and all the devils
ever born of a woman's hatred glaring out of her face as she
leaned over him. It took the three of us to drag her away while
there was still a spark of life in the man. When at last we
succeeded, he was unconscious, and the marks of her fingers were
there, as though photographed on his throat. Mr. Thomson raised a
whistle to his lips and blew it.</p>
<p>"I think, perhaps," he remarked, "the police will be
kinder."</p>
<h3>* * * * *</h3>
<p>The little supper party which we had grown accustomed to
expect after each period of utility to our chief took place on
the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id=
"Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> night under somewhat unusual
circumstances--in the saloon of the steamship <i>Zeebrugge</i>,
one of the new Dover and Ostend fleet. We were pitching pretty
heavily and facing a northwest gale, but it happened that we were
all pretty good sailors, and though the high seas came thundering
against the closed portholes, and the electric lights swung above
our heads, we were quite able to do justice to a very excellent
repast. There were so few passengers that the chief steward
winked at our smoking in a corner of the saloon, and over our
last glass of wine our host threw a little cautious light upon
the meaning of our latest adventure.</p>
<p>"The particularly unpleasant gentleman," he observed, "upon
whom you inflicted a likeness--a very excellent likeness--to Mr.
Leonard Cotton, was, as you have doubtless surmised, at one time
known as the Count von Hantzauel, whose notorious deeds in
Brussels during the German occupation are infamous throughout the
world."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't have insulted Leonard to such an extent if I'd had
the least idea beforehand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128"
id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> who he was going to turn out to
be," I declared.</p>
<p>"I shall hate my own face more than ever," Leonard
groaned.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson smiled amiably.</p>
<p>"Von Hantzauel certainly seemed to have the gift," he
observed, "of making his name hated even amongst those who were
personally strangers to him. The Baroness Spens, as you may have
surmised, was one of those who, unfortunately for her, had been
forced into a certain degree of association with him. He made his
headquarters in her house and sowed the seeds of a hatred of
which last night he reaped the harvest. Forgive my somewhat
confused metaphor. You follow me, I dare say."</p>
<p>"Why was he such an idiot as to come back?" Rose enquired.</p>
<p>"Because," Mr. Thomson explained, "it was the Baroness' wish.
The Baroness Spens is a very clever and unforgiving woman, and
she has been several years laying her plans for getting von
Hantzauel back into Brussels."</p>
<p>"But the inducement?" Rose persisted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg
129]</a></span>"Von Hantzauel," Thomson explained, "followed in
the footsteps of his illustrious chief. He was a collector of
such trifles as jewellery, money, and all manner of <i>objets
d'arts</i> of a small and portable character. With the aid of a
German smith whom he sent for when in residence at Brussels, he
constructed a very ingenious hiding place in the chateau for his
loot. When the reversal of fortunes came, he was one of those
pig-headed, obstinate asses who refused to believe in what was
coming, and he only escaped from Brussels by a miracle. Since
then he has used every argument to persuade the Baroness to bring
his little collection over the frontier to Holland. The Baroness
played with him as a cat might with a mouse. She declared that
his hiding place was so ingenious that even with the plan he had
sent her she had failed to discover it. Then she reminded him of
the past and declared that the treasure should not leave her
house without a visit from him. Finally, as you know, she
succeeded. The visit was arranged for. The whole affair called
for a certain amount of diplomacy. The direct inter<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg
130]</a></span>vention of the Belgian police would have meant the
arrest of von Hantzauel on the frontier. The affair had to be
managed differently. The Baroness is an old friend of mine and
she sought my aid."</p>
<p>"In what capacity?" I asked quickly. "And what has become of
the treasure?"</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson smiled vaguely. He listened for a moment to the
bump of the sea against the portholes. Then he filled our
glasses.</p>
<p>"An answer to those questions just now is scarcely possible,"
he replied. "We will call them, if you please, Conundrum Number
Three."</p>

<h2>CONUNDRUM #4.&mdash;THE COURTSHIP OF NAIDA</h2>
<h3>First published in <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, Feb 1921</h3>
<p class="first">Rose, Leonard and I first saw Naida Modeschka
dance from the wings of the great London music hall where she was
the star performer, and where we, very much to our surprise, had
been offered a brief engagement. I think that from our point of
vantage she was even more wonderful than from the vast and
densely packed auditorium. None of us had ever before seen
movement like it. The wooden boards her feet touched seemed at
the moment of contact to become a sea of quicksilver. She had her
own arrangement of lights, and she floated in and out of them,
her pale face and limbs glittering at one moment like polished
marble, the next only a shadow, a skulking, floating shadow, with
a pair of great black eyes shining from a terrified face. She
never told us or any one else whence came the<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
music to which she danced, notes as full of Arcadian and
mysterious poetry as Grieg, and sometimes breathing the riotous
passion of Dvor&aacute;k. She seemed to delight in unexpected
interludes, in sudden changes, and there was something even a
little cynical in the outburst of savage passion with which her
dance concluded. There was not the slightest doubt, however, as
to her complete success. The audience at this particular music
hall, the Parthenon, is seldom jaded--they are drawn from too
wholesome a class of people--but they are as quick to appreciate
a new thing as any audience in the world. There were qualities in
Naida's dancing which even the Russian Ballet had failed to
disclose--pride of the body, cynical contempt of passion for its
own sake, and underneath, the soft, alluring call to Love. She
stood by us, panting, after her fifth recall. The faintest of
perfumes, something between green tea and Russian violets, seemed
to be exuded of her breathlessness from the trembling,
exquisitely shaped body, concealed, for the sake of ancient
prejudices, under a flowing veil of black net, more
subtly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg
133]</a></span> appealing to modern perceptions than even the
naked Eve reaching up to the branches of the apple tree. We were
a little spellbound, but her eyes caught mine and I spoke.</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle," I said, "you dance as no other on earth."</p>
<p>"Why not include heaven, monsieur," she answered quickly, "for
I fear there will be no dancing like mine there."</p>
<p>She made her final bow and came back to where a gaunt and
stolid maid pushed past us and wrapped her in a long black satin
coat, trimmed and lined with black sable fur. The maid would have
hurried her off but she lingered.</p>
<p>"It is your turn, Monsieur?" she asked me. "You three who
appear now?"</p>
<p>I assented. The piano was already being drawn into position.
Rose stood a few yards away, looking at her hair in a glass. She
had already thrown aside her coat. In the auditorium I fancied
that I could still hear that faint emotional quiver lingering
like the echo of feeling.</p>
<p>"It is our turn," I replied, "but how an<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
audience could be expected to listen to our banalities after the
atmosphere you have created, I can't imagine!"</p>
<p>She made no acknowledgment of my compliment. She was looking
at me as though engrossed in her own thoughts, so that in those
few seconds I found myself studying her. No breathing person
could have called her beautiful, even good-looking. She was dark,
with dark hair, eyes and eyebrows. Her cheek bones were almost
prominent, her chin narrow, her mouth large but so sensitive that
it seemed never at rest. There was not an atom of make-up on her
face, and her pallor in the light in which she stood was almost
ghastly. Her arms and hands were as lovely as the rest of her
body. I could have imagined her, severely dressed, in the
classical shades of a great library, one of the leaders of
women's thought.</p>
<p>"I shall stay here for your performance," she announced.
"Please do your best. Sanda, fetch me a chair."</p>
<p>At the risk of seeming egotistical, I am here going to
announce that we three had very<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> much improved in our
work during these days of our prosperity. Rose's perfectly chosen
gowns, her renewed health of body and mind, seemed to have given
to her voice a richer and sweeter note, and to her feet all the
fascinating lightness of modern dancing. Leonard's sense of
humour had broadened, and his capacity for finding new stories
amounted positively to genius. I myself, in better health,
certainly found myself a more adequate partner for Rose, both in
singing and dancing. Whatever influence our patron had had to use
in the earlier days to secure us engagements was unneeded now. We
were at the Parthenon according to instructions, but the
engagement had been given to us on our own application and
without any outside intervention. Perhaps because our unambitious
performance soothed the jangled nerves of our audience, we were
extraordinarily well received that night. When it was all over, I
found Naida still waiting in her chair. She rose at once and took
my arm.</p>
<p>"You will escort me to my dressing room," she said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg
136]</a></span>"With the greatest pleasure," I assented.</p>
<p>"You see," she went on, "I am making the way easy for you. You
are a myrmidon of the great Mr. Thomson, are you not?"</p>
<p>I was startled.</p>
<p>"I know a Mr. Thomson," I admitted, "but it is some time since
I have heard from him."</p>
<p>Her eyes mocked me.</p>
<p>"The cleverest of all conspirators," she said, as she came to
a standstill outside her dressing room and waved her hand to Rose
and Leonard, "are those who do not fear to tell the truth. Lies
lead far on the road to failure, but we each have our own
methods."</p>
<p>"Believe me," I assured her earnestly, "I have never heard of
you in my life except from the newspapers."</p>
<p>"And you have never seen me before?"</p>
<p>"Never!"</p>
<p>She looked at me steadfastly. Her dark, heavily lidded eyes
seemed a little contracted; her lips smiled as though they had a
joke to themselves. She was a strange-looking creature.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg
137]</a></span>"Well," she conceded, "granted that this is our
first meeting--what of it, Monsieur?"</p>
<p>"I pray that it may not be our last," I answered, with ready
sincerity.</p>
<p>Her fingers strayed to the knob of the door.</p>
<p>"You will receive your belated instructions before very long,"
she said. "Then I shall make it easy for you. You may visit me
when you like. I live at 96, Milan Court. And so, Monsieur!"</p>
<p>She held her fingers to my lips. I am bound to admit that I
hurried back to Leonard, a little shaken.</p>
<p>"A conquest, my son," he observed, looking up from a bowl of
cold water and rubbing his head vigorously. "Rose is furious with
you. She has asked me to take her out to supper."</p>
<p>"Capital!" I replied spitefully. "I will join you."</p>
<h3>* * * * *</h3>
<p>Our conversation that evening finally turned upon a subject
which we had once or twice lately skirted somewhat
apprehensively. We supped at an inconspicuous but desirable table
in the Milan Grill Room, and in a style which<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
would have seemed to us, only a few months ago, wildly
extravagant. There was no jazz band to affront our ears and
disturb our digestion. We were in touch with the more epicurean
type of deliberate pleasure-seekers, the more select crowd who
had studied or imbibed the philosophy of pleasure. Everywhere was
an air of warmth and luxury. The men and women, mostly in
couples, by whom we were surrounded, were chiefly those who had
eschewed the hysterical quest of promiscuous pleasure for the
more settled but not less fascinating ways of Bohemian
domesticity. An actor-manager, close at hand, was giving a digest
of a play he had read that afternoon to his leading lady--also
his inseparable companion. A celebrated producer and well-known
actor was enjoying a brief period of rest with the only woman in
his life who had learnt to soothe as well as to fascinate. A
widely known and hard-worked barrister, the tragedy of whose
domestic life was known to all his friends, was revelling in one
hour of peace during the day in the company of a sympathetic and
very human little lady from an<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> adjoining theatre.
The atmosphere to us, who had only lately found our way into the
paths of prosperity, was almost intoxicating.</p>
<p>It was Leonard who started things by raising his glass to our
benefactor. We drank the toast gratefully enough. Then Rose for
the first time put into words what was so often in the minds of
all of us.</p>
<p>"Maurice," she asked me, "how long does our bargain with Mr.
Thomson actually last?"</p>
<p>"There was no time limit," I answered.</p>
<p>"Not, perhaps, in words," she persisted, "but how long in your
mind do you consider we are morally bound?"</p>
<p>"Metaphysical history would suggest the period of our
lifetime," I replied. "There is no precedent for a soul, once
disposed of, being returned to its owner."</p>
<p>She sighed.</p>
<p>"It seems a pity. We really haven't anything more to gain. One
would like to settle down and enjoy now with a clear conscience.
Why, one of you could marry me."</p>
<p>"We hadn't thought of that," Leonard said drily.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg
140]</a></span>"The fact of it is," I groaned, "we are both in
love with you." She leaned back in her chair and looked at us for
a moment. I think she realised that I had spoken the truth.</p>
<p>"Then all I can say," she murmured, "is that you are better
actors than I thought you were--and greater dears."</p>
<p>"We are wandering from the subject," I said firmly. "I propose
that we apply to Mr. Mephistopheles Thomson for a time limit. I
should think----"</p>
<p>That is just as far as I got in my daring proposal. I sat with
my mouth unbecomingly open and a fatuous look of astonishment
upon my face. My two companions also were stricken dumb. Arrived
apparently from nowhere, neat, inconspicuous and unobtrusive, Mr.
Thomson paused before our table and greeted us with pleasing
cordiality.</p>
<p>"Congratulations to all of you," he said, as he drew up a
chair and seated himself. "I was at the Parthenon to-night. If
Naida Modeschka's performance was the most wonderful, yours was
certainly the most pleasing item upon the programme."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg
141]</a></span>"We have improved, I think," Rose admitted
modestly. "Nice frocks do make so much difference."</p>
<p>"And good food," Leonard murmured.</p>
<p>"And no anxieties," I ventured.</p>
<p>"Apropos of which," the newcomer enquired, "how goes our
bargain? Do you want your souls back again?"</p>
<p>"If you've quite finished with them," Rose confessed. "We
should hate to seem ungrateful, but so far as we are concerned
all our ambitions are satisfied."</p>
<p>"We are earning twice as much as we spend," Leonard pointed
out.</p>
<p>"And we could book up for two years," I put in.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson, who upon his arrival had made mystic signs to a
waiter, watched the champagne being poured into our glasses. We
were not overcareful in the matter of our expenditure, but
champagne was the one luxury we denied ourselves except on
special occasions.</p>
<p>"You disappoint me," our patron confessed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg
142]</a></span>Rose leaned forward across the table. She spoke
quickly, almost tumultuously.</p>
<p>"Don't think us ungrateful," she begged. "We are not. We often
think of that wretched night at Cromer when you became our good
angel. Many and many a time since we have blessed your name."</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson bowed.</p>
<p>"Ours was a bargain," he said, "and you have fulfilled your
share of it. My disappointment springs from another cause. I have
pictured you in my mind as children of the land of
Adventure."</p>
<p>"We have lifted the curtain," I ventured to remind him.</p>
<p>"You have done more," he admitted. "You have all three shown
capacity and courage. Why withdraw? Believe me, the end and aim
of life is not prosperity. The moment the love of adventure
ceases, the slumber of middle age commences. There isn't anything
more fatal to genius or to the fuller life than a contented
conscience, a swelling bank account, and an amble along the easy
ways. I give you back what you are pleased to call your souls, if
you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg
143]</a></span> will. In five years' time, the three of you will
be prematurely middle-aged, the limits of your ambitions will be
fixed, one day will be as another. With the passing of all
mystery from your lives, will come the adipose somnolence which
breeds mental and moral indigestion."</p>
<p>I think that we were all hypnotised. The calmness of his
speech, his precise and unemotional handling of words, seemed to
lend to them an even greater significance. Before we had realised
what was happening, Mr. Thomson was on his feet again.</p>
<p>"We will make that time limit one year, dating from the night
at Cromer," he pronounced.</p>
<p>"Yes!" we all three assented.</p>
<p>"To-morrow afternoon at four o'clock," he added, turning to
me, "you will call upon Naida Modeschka, the dancer who is now
performing at the Parthenon."</p>
<p>"I have already made her acquaintance," I told him. "She spoke
to me this evening. She referred to you."</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson smiled benevolently.</p>
<p>"Naida is wonderful," he said. "Never<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg
144]</a></span>theless, you will call. Ask her what has become of
Felix Worth. Afterwards, place yourself in her hands. She will
explain exactly what is required of you."</p>
<p>As unobtrusively as he had come, he departed. He attracted no
attention, and looked neither to the right nor to the left. As he
vanished through the revolving door, we all looked at one
another.</p>
<p>"Mr. Mephistopheles Thomson," Rose murmured.</p>
<p>"With an accent on the Christian name," Leonard remarked.</p>
<h3>* * * * *</h3>
<p>Naida received me very graciously on the following afternoon.
I was a little surprised that she had made no attempt whatever to
alter her surroundings or in any way to create an atmosphere. The
ordinary hotel furniture and hangings were lightened only by a
profusion of flowers, mostly deep red roses. In place of the
flowing robes one might have expected, the great dancer wore a
severe tailor-made costume of grey tweed. Her hair was brushed
plainly back from her forehead and<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> tied with ribbon
behind. There was no other caller present when I arrived.</p>
<p>"It would be charming of you to come so soon," she murmured,
as she held out her hand, "if it were your own will which brought
you."</p>
<p>"My own will would have brought me here in any case," I
assured her, "but as it happens I have another mission. I am to
ask you what has become of Felix Worth."</p>
<p>I looked into the eyes of another woman for a moment, and I
was afraid. Her momentary fit of fury, however, passed. She
motioned me to a chair.</p>
<p>"How much do you know of this matter?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Nothing at all," I answered promptly.</p>
<p>"That is the way with him," she ruminated. "His agents never
know anything."</p>
<p>"That does not, I trust, prevent my finding great pleasure in
making your acquaintance, Mademoiselle," I ventured.</p>
<p>She looked at me curiously. Sixty seconds ago I should have
described her as being, off the stage, disappointedly plain. I
realised my mistake.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg
146]</a></span>"It does not prevent your paying me any
compliments you choose," she replied. "There is no reason why we
should not be friends--even comrades. The only cloud between us
appears to be that it will fall to your lot to kill the only man
I have ever really cared for."</p>
<p>I started in my chair.</p>
<p>"I can assure you," I told her, "I am not out for that sort of
thing at all."</p>
<p>"But it will come," she persisted.</p>
<p>"It will not," I contradicted her firmly. "I have done all the
killing I want to, in fair fighting. I have a weakness for
adventures, but nothing would induce me to become an
assassin."</p>
<p>She looked at me contemplatively, leaning across from her
chair with her chin balanced upon her hands. Then she got up and
brought me a queer round wooden box of fragrant Russian
cigarettes. She herself lit one, and I followed her example.</p>
<p>"Are you afraid, dear earnest Englishman," she asked, "that I
should hate you? Let me tell you the truth. For this man I have
no love any more. And he must die."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg
147]</a></span>"He may live or he may die," I answered, "but I am
no man's executioner."</p>
<p>"We shall see," she remarked indifferently. "You are a just
man, beyond a doubt, but I like you. You are different from all
others."</p>
<p>"In what respect?" I enquired.</p>
<p>"I admit you here," she replied, "to the intimacy of a private
visit, yet you have not yet suggested that you should become my
lover. It intrigues me, this diffidence."</p>
<p>I felt a sudden desire to get out of the room. She laughed at
me, laughed with simple, unaffected mirth, laughed till she came
over and laid her hands upon my shoulders.</p>
<p>"Go away, dear man," she begged, "before I make myself foolish
about you. You shall sit at my side to-night, and perhaps then,
when you see what others think of me, you may whisper different
things."</p>
<p>"And where do I sit by your side to-night?" I asked.</p>
<p>"You and your two friends," she said, "sup with me in the
restaurant downstairs at midnight. Convey my compliments and this
invitation to your charming lady companion. I<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
shall see her at the theatre and will confirm it."</p>
<p>She gave me her fingers and held them for a moment against my
lips. Then I went out, a little dazed.</p>
<p>I began to fear that Naida was going to make trouble for me.
At the theatre that evening she demanded my constant attendance.
Twice she sent notes to my dressing room, and in the midst of the
tumultuous applause which followed her wonderful dancing, when
she stood in the wings with us after her seventh recall, she tore
one of the red roses which had been thrown on to the stage from
its cluster, and thrust it in my buttonhole.</p>
<p>"So!" she whispered. "They will know from whom that rose
comes. Your fingers will caress it when you sing. They will
applaud you the more for my sake."</p>
<div align="center"><img src=
"1203481h-images/The7Conundrums1.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration"></div>
<p>This was all very pretty and soothing to my vanity, and, I
frankly admit, in its way pleasant, but I had all the time the
feeling that it was likely to bring trouble upon me. When, in her
most charming manner, Naida had issued her invitation to Rose,
her enthusi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id=
"Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>astic acceptance was entirely
marred for me by the manner of it.</p>
<p>"A supper party will be perfectly delightful," Rose declared,
smiling with dangerous sweetness. "I have a little headache
to-night but that will pass. In any case you will not mind if
Leonard--if Mr. Cotton should bring me away early."</p>
<p>"So long as you do not rob me of my dear cavalier," Naida
replied, to my dismay, squeezing my arm.</p>
<p>I marched Leonard on one side, taking advantage of the
insistent roars of recall which drew Naida back on to the
stage.</p>
<p>"Look here, Len," I said, "I don't know what this game is, but
I'm playing it for the three of us. I am obeying orders so far as
Mademoiselle Naida is concerned. If Rose won't see it, I shall
rely upon you."</p>
<p>"I'll do my best, old chap," he promised, with a gloom which I
fancied was not altogether natural. "It's a jolly hard situation,
though. Rose had asked me to take her out to supper to-night, and
to dinner on Sunday night."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg
150]</a></span>"You can count that dinner off," I said firmly.
"We three have dined together every Sunday night since we started
out. Sometimes it's been a scrag of mutton and a glass of beer;
once or twice--that week at Cromer, Len--not even that. On Sunday
night it's going to be caviare and a Maryland chicken, and I'm in
it."</p>
<p>"That's all right," Leonard assured me. "Of course, Rose
thought that you'd be in attendance on Naida."</p>
<p>"You and I won't have any misunderstanding, at any rate, Len,"
I insisted. "Naida means just as much to me as that bit of fluff
on your coat. When our year is up, I shall ask Rose to marry me,
and though you're the dearest fellow in the world, I hope she'll
have me and not you."</p>
<p>"I sha'n't take advantage, old chap," Leonard promised, with a
sigh, "but it's getting filthily difficult. She pretended she
wanted me to kiss her last night."</p>
<p>"I'll punch your head if you do," I answered savagely. "Our
call."</p>
<p>The supper party did not improve matters.<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> We
found quite a distinguished little gathering in the foyer of the
Milan, including the managing director of the Parthenon, some of
the best known dramatic critics, a famous actor and his wife,
another and a lady who might have been, a foreign ambassador, and
two other well-known and distinguished men about town. Naida did
her duty by placing a very distinguished nobleman with
cosmopolitan tastes upon her right, but, to my secret dismay and
the wonder of the rest of the company, she insisted upon my
occupying the seat on the other side of her.</p>
<p>"Now," she whispered, looking at me from under her eyelashes
with that slow, curious smile upon her lips, "I have made the
little lady jealous, is it not so? And also the great managing
director who pays me my salary, and perhaps others. But what does
it matter? You are content?"</p>
<p>The lie came uneasily from my lips. Naida, however, seemed
satisfied. It was borne in upon me now that it was her deliberate
purpose, part of the game, in fact, not only to exploit me as a
victim of her charms but to<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> practically
advertise her simulated infatuation. I watched Rose flirting
desperately with a very attractive man who was seated upon her
left, and for a moment I felt that the situation was
impossible--that I should do best to mutter a few plain words to
my hostess and deliberately dissociate myself from the r&ocirc;le
into which I had drifted. Then I remembered our chief's
confidence--Naida spoke to me with unexpected kindness. I caught
the echo of Rose's unnecessarily joyous laughter, and I changed
my mind. Thenceforth I played my part. I lent myself to the
gaiety of the moment. We were all young together. The wine was
good, life was good, the very music seemed playing us down the
avenues of pleasure. From a gay party we became almost an
uproarious one. We moved outside into the lounge for our coffee,
Naida never letting me for an instant leave her side, relegating
to me the duties of host, thrusting her pocketbook into my hand,
insisting that I should order the cigars and liqueurs, fee the
waiters, and even sign the bill on her behalf. There were many
smiles amongst the little company,<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> shrugs of the
shoulders, and whispered enquiries as to my identity. My
fictitious position seemed to make me an object of envy, but I
never altogether lost my head. I waited for my opportunity, and
when it came I rose quickly to my feet and walked over to Rose's
side. Her companion of the moment had been summoned away to speak
to some acquaintances in another part of the lounge.</p>
<p>"Rose," I began sternly----</p>
<p>She looked at me with a bright but artificial smile. I leaned
down and continued under my breath.</p>
<p>"I play the buffoon to order," I reminded her. "You, too, have
your part in this."</p>
<p>"Indeed?" she murmured.</p>
<p>"Yes! Your part is not to make mine more difficult. Your part
is to remember----"</p>
<p>Then I stopped short. It was a difficult position. There was
my contract with Leonard to be borne in mind.</p>
<p>"To remember what?" she asked, looking at me more
naturally.</p>
<p>"The things of which your heart assures you," I answered. "I
am only human. If I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id=
"Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> fail to-night, the fault will not
be wholly mine."</p>
<p>After that there was a change in Rose's demeanour, and once,
when our eyes met, she smiled. Naida, however, still played her
part of sorceress. She seemed impatient of every word she was
forced to speak to others. She whispered often in my ear. Even
her fingers sought mine. It was just at this stage that for the
first time I noticed the somewhat singular appearance of a man
who was watching us from the few seats upstairs reserved for
guests of the hotel who were not in evening dress. As though he
sought concealment, he had found a chair in the most remote
corner and was half hidden by a slight projection of the wall. He
had a mass of black hair, a heavy, sallow face, from which one
formed the idea that he had recently removed a beard, and dark
staring eyes. He was untidily dressed for his surroundings,
amongst which he seemed curiously out of place. An impulse
prompted me to point him out to Naida. She glanced in the
direction I indicated but merely shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg
155]</a></span>"Dear friend," she whispered, "you forget that I
am a famous person, more so abroad than in your little island.
There are many who watch me with thoughts in their heart which
they will never dare to utter. There are many who would give a
share of their possessions to be seated where you are seated, to
be treated as I am treating you."</p>
<p>"The man is a foreigner, without a doubt," I remarked.</p>
<p>"And foreigners," she answered, with a stabbing little glance,
"are quicker to feel and understand than Englishmen."</p>
<p>We kept the party going until long past closing time, and then
an adjournment of our diminished numbers was made to Naida's
suite. Here she distributed signed photographs to her remaining
guests, accompanied by a wave of the hand which meant dismissal.
Rose and Leonard were amongst the first to leave, Rose with a
look in her eyes which might have meant anything. I stepped
quickly forward. Naida looked at me warningly. Now that we had
left the lounge, it seemed to me that her demeanour had to some
extent changed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg
156]</a></span>"For your impatience, Monsieur Maurice," she said,
"you will be the last. Offer the cigarettes, if you please. And
your friend Mr. Cotton, will he not take a whisky and soda before
he goes?"</p>
<p>One by one they drifted away. Rose and Leonard were driven
home by one of the former's new admirers. The time came when we
were alone. Naida listened to the closing of the door and to the
clanging of the lift gate. Then with her back to the table
against which she was leaning, she looked across at me with an
odd little smile upon her lips.</p>
<p>"So we are alone, my friend."</p>
<p>"It has that appearance," I admitted, taking one of her
cigarettes and lighting it. "I await your further
instructions."</p>
<p>She nodded her head slowly. She seemed to be considering my
attitude.</p>
<p>"My further instructions," she mimicked. "Oh, Monsieur
Maurice, what a strange person! Ring the bell on your left,
please."</p>
<p>I obeyed. A maid presented herself at once from the inner
room. Naida spoke to her for a moment in some weird language.
Then she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id=
"Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> turned towards me, yawned and
stretched herself.</p>
<p>"Prepare for a shock," she said. "For ten minutes I leave you.
You seat yourself in that easy chair, you take a whisky and soda
and the evening paper, you make yourself at home. You
understand?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly," I answered, not at all sorry for a few minutes'
solitude.</p>
<p>"Then au revoir! But have no fear," she added, looking back
with a mocking smile, "I shall return."</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour or so passed. I heard Naida telephoning
from her bedroom and heard her voice in conversation with her
maid. Then she reappeared. She was wearing a yellow creation tied
around her with a girdle, Chinese sandals tied with broad yellow
ribbon; and her unloosed hair was gathered together with ribbon
of the same colour. She displayed herself for my admiration.</p>
<p>"You admire, Monsieur Maurice? You like the colour?"</p>
<p>"You look charming," I replied. "And now?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg
158]</a></span>She held up her finger.</p>
<p>"You are not to stir," she directed, waving her finger at
me.</p>
<p>She moved towards the door which led into the corridor, opened
it softly and peered outside. Then, as though not satisfied, she
disappeared altogether. When she returned, she closed the door
with a little slam and threw herself into a chair opposite to
me.</p>
<p>"And now?" I repeated patiently.</p>
<p>"It is the hardest part of your task, this, Monsieur Maurice,"
she said, with a demure little droop of the eyes. "You see the
time? It is exactly two o'clock. For one hour you remain where
you are. At the end of that hour you are free. You may then
leave, and, if you wish it so, your courtship of Naida is
over."</p>
<p>"And for that hour?" I asked, a little unsteadily.</p>
<p>She came and sat on the arm of my chair. Her face was upturned
to mine.</p>
<p>"Shall I keep you company?" she whispered.</p>
<p>I leaned down and took the kiss she offered<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
me. I held her for a moment in my arms. Then I gripped her
wrists.</p>
<p>"Naida," I said, and my own voice sounded to me unfamiliar,
"of course I know this is a game, but I don't understand the
rules."</p>
<p>"We make them," she murmured.</p>
<p>"I am in love with Rose Mindel," I continued. "I should be
married to her at the present moment but for a stupid agreement
between Leonard Cotton and myself, made when we three started out
together. I am in love with her, but I'm no Joseph. You know what
you are, and your power. I'm not any different from other
men."</p>
<p>"But you do not care, then?" she asked quickly.</p>
<p>"There isn't any ordinary young man of my type," I answered,
"who has drunk your wine and sat by your side all the evening,
and received your kindness, and finds himself here alone with
you, who wouldn't care--in a way--the wrong way. I care like
that, if it's any good. And now you understand."</p>
<p>She slipped from her place, kissed me on both eyes, and ran
across to the door of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160"
id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> inner room. She looked back at
me only for a moment, opened her lips, said nothing, and
disappeared, closing the door softly behind her. I mixed myself
the stiffest whisky and soda I had ever concocted in my life, lit
a cigar from a box I found on the sideboard, and sat down to
watch the clock.</p>
<p>At five minutes to three, I was walking up and down the room
with my overcoat on. At a minute to the hour, as I stood with my
eyes glued to the clock, the inner door softly opened. Naida
stood framed upon the threshold. There was a look of distress
upon her face.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Maurice," she said, "I had made up my mind to say
nothing, but that was wrong. You are a very honourable young man
and I have not met many. It has been promised to me that no harm
shall come to you, but yet--go warily to the lift."</p>
<p>She disappeared and closed the door. For the first time she
locked it. Somehow, I felt, as I stepped out into the corridor,
that the dangers which might be waiting for me were small things.
I stood for several seconds,<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> looking up and down.
To reach the lift I had to traverse the whole of the corridor,
turn to the left and pass along another shorter one. I stepped
out carelessly enough, and then--the scantily lit passage seemed
suddenly filled with whispering voices, with eyes peering at me
from mysterious corners; the soft carpets behind me were
reverberant with muffled and stealthy footsteps. I was acutely
conscious of the presence of danger. As I neared the corner of
the corridor every nerve of my body was bristling with
apprehension. Before I turned, I paused for a moment and looked
behind. There was only a single electric lamp burning, but I
could see dimly along the empty space to the end. There was no
sign of any moving figure, nor any sound. Then I turned the
corner to find myself suddenly seized in a pair of giant arms,
the dull flicker of upraised steel before my eyes, the sallow,
brutelike face, the black, flaming eyes of the man who had
watched me from the lounge, within an inch or two of me.</p>
<p>I had no chance to call out. My assailant's left hand was upon
my throat. I could see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162"
id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> him gathering strength to drive
that knife down into my heart. My brain was perfectly active. I
waited with tense muscles for the terrible moment, meaning to
fling myself on one side in the hope that I might escape mortal
injury from that first blow, at any rate. And then I saw
something loom up behind. I saw an arm raised even higher than my
captor's, and I heard the wickedest sound in life--the crash of
dull metal into a man's skull. The grasp upon my throat was
instantly relaxed, doors were thrown open along the corridor, and
I sank back into a momentary fit of unconsciousness.</p>
<h3>* * * * *</h3>
<p>If our customary supper party with Mr. Thomson lacked some of
those qualities which in the earlier days of our adventures had
made it so wonderful a thing, the change of venue, and our host's
curious genius in devising new dishes, still contrived to make
the occasion a memorable one. We met this time in a private room
at the Hotel Albion at Brighton, whither a telephone message had
summoned us earlier in the day. Mr. Thomson, spick and span
as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg
163]</a></span> ever, looking in the pink of condition, commended
to us the best oysters in the world and sipped almost reverently
the contents of a dust-covered bottle of Chablis.</p>
<p>"I am not sure," he told us, with the air of one imparting
grave knowledge, "that in these days it is not possible to find
better vintages out of London than one comes across even in the
restaurants de luxe. This wine, for instance."</p>
<p>"The wine is wonderful," Rose agreed. "These oysters are
wonderful, too, and I never saw such a lobster mayonnaise as that
upon the sideboard. But, dear Mr. Thomson, if you expect us to
enjoy our supper, do be merciful. There will be no waiter in the
room for at least five minutes. Give us some idea as to the
meaning of this last adventure."</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson smiled benevolently.</p>
<p>"Why not?" he said. "Here is the story in a very few words.
There was in London, ten days ago, the most dangerous anarchist
and political disturber of the peace in Europe. His name is a
household word to all of you. He passed here as Paul Kansky."</p>
<p>"Naida's lover," I ventured.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg
164]</a></span>"As a matter of fact, her husband," Mr. Thomson
explained. "His removal was absolutely necessary for the internal
peace of this country. There were a hundred charges on which he
could have been arrested, but not one for which he could have
been safely put out of the way. Being at times open to accept a
contract of this nature, I undertook to dispose of him."</p>
<p>I shivered a little as I listened. Mr. Thomson continued very
much as though he were referring to some ordinary commercial
undertaking.</p>
<p>"Kansky's one weakness was Naida Modeschka, his one passion
jealousy. With the aid of our young friend here, I succeeded in
fanning that passion into a red-hot flame. I succeeded, too, in
engineering such an attempt at wilful murder on the part of
Kansky that his own demise, owing to the apparently accidental
intervention of a casual rescuer, seemed to occur quite
naturally. You behold the result of an exceedingly well-laid
scheme. This mischievous person is dead and buried under the name
he bore at the Milan Hotel, and<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> which the great
world of his followers does not recognise."</p>
<p>"Then my rescuer," I exclaimed, "John P. Martin, the American
Oil Trust man----"</p>
<p>"Precisely," Mr. Thomson interrupted. "Mr. Martin was my
agent, a man of iron and a professional fighter, planted in room
number eighty-four, with instructions to intervene on your behalf
in such a way that Kansky could give no more trouble."</p>
<p>"And those other two men who gave evidence--the
witnesses?"</p>
<p>"Also arranged for," Mr. Thomson acknowledged. "It was really
a very well-planned affair. The man Kansky's passion for Naida
was proved by the letters produced in court. His attack upon our
young friend here provided ample excuse for Mr. Martin's vigorous
action. The witnesses, of course, were able to declare that
Kansky was in the act of committing a probable murder, and that
Martin's contra attack, with its unfortunate results, saved your
life."</p>
<p>"And Naida?" Rose enquired.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson smiled.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg
166]</a></span>"How should we be able to deal with these little
affairs," he observed, "but for the vagaries, my dear Miss
Mindel, of your wonderful sex? Naida was a very willing
accomplice in our little scheme. For seven years in a brutalised
Russia she had lived under that man's dominance. When she was
fortunate enough to escape over here, it was certainly not with
the idea of again submitting to it. I hear the waiter. Any more
questions?"</p>
<p>"For whom were you acting?" I asked eagerly. "How did this
affair come into your hands?"</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson seemed to be listening to the roar of the sea,
which came to us pleasantly through the open window.</p>
<p>"Ah!" he murmured. "That again is a question the answer to
which I fear must be postponed. Shall we call it Conundrum Number
Four?"</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg

<h2>CONUNDRUM #5.&mdash;THE TRAGEDY AT GREYMARSHES</h2>
<h3>First published in <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, Mar 1921</h3>
<p class="first">"Spring," Leonard declared, fanning himself with
his straw hat and breathing in the ozone from the waves which
rippled up to within a few yards of our chairs, "is upon us."</p>
<p>"I must get some new frocks," Rose murmured absently.</p>
<p>"To-morrow," I reflected, "I must go through my tennis
flannels."</p>
<p>"Jolly good-looking girl that was with the party from the
Grange at the show last night," Leonard continued reminiscently.
"I liked the way her eyelashes curled. Jolly fine figure,
too."</p>
<p>"The tutor man is quite handsome," Rose ruminated. "He ties
his black evening bow just the way I like."</p>
<p>"Handsome!" I scoffed. "Why, he's got a cast in his eye! He
reminds me, more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id=
"Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> anything, of the plaster villains
in the Chamber of Horrors at Madame Tussaud's."</p>
<p>"I didn't notice any cast," Rose sighed, her eyes turned
dreamily seawards. "He looked at me hard enough, too, when I was
dancing."</p>
<p>"They're a strange crew at the Grange," I observed, lighting a
cigarette from the case which Leonard had thrown me. "I can't
altogether size them up."</p>
<p>Rose turned towards me reproachfully.</p>
<p>"You are becoming obsessed, Maurice, with your love of
adventures," she complained gently. "You think of nothing else.
Surely, in this dear, old-world place we can have a little rest;
we can drop the tenseness of the last few months and become just
simple, natural human beings again."</p>
<p>"The chief didn't send us down here for nothing," I
ventured.</p>
<p>"Don't forget," she reminded me, "that at our last supper at
Brighton I begged for a little rest. Only a few weeks afterwards,
he sent us here. I am quite certain that nothing ever happened at
Greymarshes. If we get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169"
id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> into any trouble here, it will
simply be because the spring is so disturbing."</p>
<p>She looked at me lazily, almost affectionately. Then she
looked at Leonard. His hat was tilted over his eyes and his hands
were clasped around his knees. There was very little of his
good-natured, pudgy face to be seen.</p>
<p>"I wonder," she continued, with a little sigh, "why neither of
you ever make love to me. I'm very attractive."</p>
<p>"The situation," Leonard began, taking his hat off and sitting
up----</p>
<p>"Oh, hang the situation!" Rose interrupted irritably. "If you
can't make up your minds which of you it is to be, you might toss
up or something. Here's spring coming on. I'm twenty-two years
old, and I haven't got a young man. You will drive me to answer
some of the desperate notes which are showered upon me by
lovesick youths from the front row. I had another last night from
Arthur. I believe that he really loves me."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid Arthur will have to be spanked," I said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg
170]</a></span>Rose made a little grimace.</p>
<p>"There is such a thing, Mr. Maurice Lister," she declared, "as
playing the watchdog just a little too zealously--especially in
the springtime. See who's coming. I think I shall turn round and
smile."</p>
<p>We both looked along the sands in the direction which she had
indicated by her parasol. A tall, weedy young man, dressed with
the utmost care in a grey flannel suit, brown shoes and linen
spats, a Panama hat and a quaintly impossible tie, came slowly
towards us, swinging a stick in his hand. As he drew near, he
diffused multitudinous odours. His pimply face was suffused with
a deep flow of colour. We realised at once what was going to
happen. The young man whom we knew by repute only as Mr. Arthur
Dompers, established at the Grange with a tutor and a small
company of satellites, had evidently made up his mind to speak to
us.</p>
<p>He came to a standstill, sidled round to the front of us, and
raised his hat.</p>
<p>"Good morning! I say, you'll forgive my<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
saying so--what? Awfully jolly show of yours! Ripping!"</p>
<p>Now I cannot say that any of us took to this young man, and,
considering our Bohemian manner of life, we none of us had a
fancy for chance acquaintances. The gentle rebuke which we had
meditated, however, died away, first on Rose's lips and then on
mine. It became apparent to us that the boy was horribly
nervous.</p>
<p>"Glad you like it," I rejoined.</p>
<p>"So nice of you," Rose murmured.</p>
<p>"Quite a crowd from your place last night, wasn't there?"
Leonard observed.</p>
<p>"That's right," the young man acquiesced. "We all weighed
in--had dinner early on purpose. Jolly place you've got
here."</p>
<p>"Won't you sit down?" Rose invited.</p>
<p>The boy squatted promptly at her feet. He wore pink socks and
he reeked of scent, yet there was something a little pathetic in
his obvious desire to be friendly.</p>
<p>"Are you cramming for anything in particular?" I asked
him.</p>
<p>"I was supposed to go in for the Army,"<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
was the dubious reply, "but the exams are so jolly difficult. I
failed for Sandhurst twice. Now they're trying to get me in at
Cambridge so that I can join a cadet corps."</p>
<p>"The exams are so much stiffer since the war," Rose remarked
consolingly.</p>
<p>"Are any of your people down here with you?" I enquired.</p>
<p>The boy shook his head.</p>
<p>"I haven't any people to speak of," he confided, "except an
uncle I have scarcely ever seen. Another uncle--my father's
brother--left me all my money. Sometimes," the young man added,
with a queer flash of seriousness which made one forget his socks
and his tie and his pimples, "I wish he hadn't."</p>
<p>"It must be awfully nice, though, to feel that you've plenty
of time in life for games and all that sort of thing," Rose
remarked, with a mild attempt at consolation.</p>
<p>"I'm not very good at games," the young man confessed. "Mr.
Duncombe and his friends are so much better than I am, and they
always laugh at me."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg
173]</a></span>"That is a very untutorlike thing to do," Rose
declared indignantly.</p>
<p>The young man looked frightened.</p>
<p>"Mr. Duncombe is very good to me--very kind indeed," he
repeated, in parrot-like fashion.</p>
<p>"Is he?" Rose queried drily.</p>
<p>"He has no end of people down so that we shouldn't be dull,"
the young man went on. "There's his sister--she's very kind to
me, too. I think I shall have to marry her."</p>
<p>"Why?" Rose asked in bewilderment.</p>
<p>"I think Mr. Duncombe would like me to," was the resigned
reply. "I am very fond of Ella. She sings and dances
beautifully."</p>
<p>"How old are you?" Rose enquired.</p>
<p>The boy seemed on the point of making another parrot-like
reply. Then he chanced to meet the kindly expression in Rose's
face as she leaned towards him. He hesitated.</p>
<p>"There's a sort of secret about my age," he confided. "Mr.
Duncombe likes me to tell every one that I am twenty."</p>
<p>"And aren't you?" I asked curiously.</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg
174]</a></span>"I shall be twenty-one on Saturday," he said. "I
shall be able to sign cheques of my own then--and make my
will."</p>
<p>"What do you want to make your will for?" Rose asked. "You're
strong enough, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"It is the duty of every one with a great deal of money to
make their will directly they are twenty-one," the boy declared,
as though repeating a lesson. "If I had my own way," he added,
looking up at Rose, "I should leave a great deal of money to you,
but I don't suppose I shall be allowed to."</p>
<p>"Good gracious, Mr. Dompers!" Rose exclaimed. "Why, I scarcely
know you!"</p>
<p>"I like your face," the young man continued earnestly. "If you
saw the faces of the people who are staying at the Grange, you
would know what I mean. They all look as though they wanted
something. They remind me sometimes of a pack of hounds. And they
pretend not to, but they are always watching me."</p>
<p>We had been so engrossed in the self-disclosures of this
half-witted young man that we had not noticed the approach of
another prom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id=
"Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>enader along the sands. It was a
very different person who now accosted us, hat in hand and a
courteous smile upon his lips. There was not a single criticism
in which the most fastidious might indulge against Hilary
Duncombe's address, his manners or his clothes.</p>
<p>"Good morning! I am glad to see that my young ward has been
finding friends."</p>
<p>The young man scrambled at once to his feet and stood, awkward
and speechless, a little apart. His tutor, the very prototype of
kindly and aristocratic ease, addressed a few kindly remarks to
us.</p>
<p>"I am so thankful," he went on, "when Arthur finds courage to
speak to any one. He is a good boy, but he finds conversation
with strangers as a rule difficult."</p>
<p>"We haven't found him at all shy," Rose assured him, with a
smile at the subject of these remarks. "On the contrary, he has
been entertaining us quite nicely."</p>
<p>Mr. Duncombe appeared to find Rose's favourable judgment a
matter for personal gratification.</p>
<p>"You are very kind," he said. "I am sure<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
that Arthur has already told you how charmed we were with your
performance last night. My guests are agitating for a permanent
change in our dinner hour, that we may be more frequent
attendants."</p>
<p>"How nice!" Rose murmured. "It does make quite a difference to
see some civilised people in the reserved seats."</p>
<p>"My sister," Duncombe continued, "would be delighted to make
your acquaintance. We may, perhaps, persuade you to pay us a
little visit at the Grange after the performance one evening.
Arthur," he went on, "we must get back now. Ella is waiting for a
set of tennis."</p>
<p>They moved off together. The impression they left behind was
an unpleasant one.</p>
<p>"A second Ardalmont case," Leonard suggested.</p>
<p>"In which case," I reflected gloomily, "the mystery of our
presence here is solved."</p>
<p>We were a little depressed as we returned to the hotel--a
long, grey-stone building, once a farmhouse and still entirely
unpretentious. Our worst prognostications were promptly verified.
The maidservant who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id=
"Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> waited upon us in the coffee room
brought me a note with a typewritten address.</p>
<p>"This was left here by a motor-cyclist soon after you went
out, sir," she announced.</p>
<p>I tore open the envelope and we pored over it:</p>
<br>
<p class="note" style="text-align:left"><tt>Accept any
hospitality proffered from the Grange. Encourage the young man,
Arthur Dompers, to talk, watch Duncombe, and report on the
situation.</tt></p>
<br>
<p>"Dull as ditchwater!" I exclaimed, as I tore up the
communication in disgust. "An unprepossessing cub of a boy, whom
his tutor permits to be fleeced at billiards and whom he is
probably going to marry to his sister. Sordid as it can be. Not a
thrill in it for us."</p>
<p>"This may be my show," Rose mused, her blue eyes very wide
open and innocent. "I may be able to guide the young man from the
matrimonial noose. I wonder if he is really very rich. Perhaps
I'll marry him myself. I suppose I could keep him on a
chain."</p>
<p>I sipped my <i>ap&eacute;ritif</i> gloomily. The taste of true
adventures was still upon my palate, and the obviousness of this
one repelled.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg
178]</a></span>Our ideas as to the menacing nature of Arthur
Dompers' surroundings were to some extent modified by our first
visit to the Grange, which took place that night after the
performance. Ella Duncombe was a rather slangy, somewhat
unpleasant-looking young woman of apparently twenty-six or
twenty-seven years of age. She had a bad temper, which she
scarcely troubled to conceal, and conducted herself generally
towards her brother's charge with more contempt than toleration.
She scarcely fulfilled one's idea of an adventuress. Major
Lethwaite, a guest in the house whom we had fixed upon as the
person accustomed to play Arthur Dompers for a hundred pounds at
billiards whenever finances ran low, was to all appearance a
perfectly harmless person who played sixpenny points at bridge
and thought sixpenny pool excessive. Laura Richardson, a friend
of Ella's, was just an ordinary, fairly well-bred, good-looking
but rather boisterous young person. Mrs. Scatterwell, whose place
apparently was that of chaperon, was a handsome and rather silent
woman, whose sole interest<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> seemed to be centred
in Duncombe himself. The m&eacute;nage was perhaps a curious one,
but scarcely suspicious. Our host himself appeared to have no
reserves except on the subject of his young charge.</p>
<p>"After the war was a bit of a knock for most of us," he
remarked meditatively, as we men sat in the smoking room of the
Grange after a very excellent supper. "Here are you, Lister, with
a game arm, going round the country entertaining, more or less, I
take it, for your living. I tried every job that was offered me
and did very little good at any of them. Last of all I took this
bear-leading on, and, between you and me, I sometimes wish to God
I hadn't!"</p>
<p>"Why?" I asked. "The boy seems amiable enough."</p>
<p>"He seems so," Duncombe assented drily, "but the fact of it is
that he is innately clumsy and innately deceitful. There is no
sport for which he shows the least aptitude. I've tried them all
with the same result. The only thing he can do is swim, and even
then it's hard work to get him into the sea unless the sun
shines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg
180]</a></span> He hasn't the slightest taste; I am bound by the
trustees' deed to allow him pocket money at the rate of a hundred
pounds a month, and half of it he spends in buying most
outrageous clothes. You know who he is, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"Not an idea," I replied.</p>
<p>Duncombe's eyebrows were slightly raised. He looked at me
keenly.</p>
<p>"Dear me!" he exclaimed. "I took it for granted that you knew
the story. He is the Welsh miner's orphan, who inherited two and
a quarter million from Jacob Dompers of New York. A nice little
windfall for a cub like this, isn't it?"</p>
<p>I remembered reading the story in the newspapers some years
ago. So did Leonard.</p>
<p>"What about his relatives?" the latter asked.</p>
<p>"The only one with whom I have had any communication,"
Duncombe replied, "was a Welsh Baptist Minister who declined to
have anything to say to the young man, and who wrote me on half a
sheet of brown grocery paper, pointing out by means of many
Biblical texts that no person with a banking ac<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg
181]</a></span>count could hope to escape the flames of the
bottomless pit."</p>
<p>"Who placed the boy in your charge, then?" I enquired.</p>
<p>"The London agents for the New York solicitors. I answered an
advertisement. I think they realise," he went on, "that I have
done my best. I have tried to fit him for one or two professions,
in vain."</p>
<p>"How long have you had him?" Leonard asked.</p>
<p>Duncombe's long fingers played for a moment with his small
black moustache. There was a quick light in his eyes as he
glanced towards Leonard.</p>
<p>"Three years this June," he answered.</p>
<p>"Then he was sixteen when he came to you?"</p>
<p>Duncombe assented with a little motion of his head.</p>
<p>"You probably think that he is backward now for nineteen," he
said. "You should have seen him when he came to me."</p>
<p>"I suppose he is backward," I admitted,<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
"and yet, to tell you the truth, I should have thought him
older."</p>
<p>"His twentieth birthday is this week," Duncombe told us. "I am
getting a thousand a year and my expenses for looking after him,
and I haven't any prospects of a job when he is out of my hands,
but I wish to heavens it was his twenty-first!--I suppose we
ought to see what the others are doing."</p>
<p>We made our way out into the hall, which was the main living
room of the Grange. Arthur was playing billiards with Lethwaite,
playing sullenly and without interest, and turning around after
every stroke to listen to the conversation between Rose and the
other two girls, who were seated upon a lounge, watching.
Lethwaite, just as we appeared, went out with a stroke which was
an obvious fluke. Arthur flung half a crown across the table and
put up his cue ill-humoredly.</p>
<p>"Beastly fluke!" he grumbled. "No one can play against such
luck."</p>
<p>He strode over with his hands in his pockets to where Rose was
seated. Miss Duncombe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id=
"Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> watched him approach with a sombre
light in her dark eyes.</p>
<p>"Bad-tempered again, Arthur?" she observed.</p>
<p>"He's a rotten fluker," the young man rejoined surlily. "He
wins all my pocket money."</p>
<p>For a single moment the whole situation seemed to be
commonplace, almost absurd. Here was a sulky, ill-conditioned
boy, pitchforked into the charge of a very ordinary little
company of gentlepeople, who were doing their best to make him
one of themselves. Duncombe's rebuke was free from all severity,
and it was certainly merited.</p>
<p>"Arthur," he said, "you should never accuse your opponent of
fluking at any game. Take your defeat in silence if you cannot be
pleasant about it. Mr. Lister or Mr. Cotton would tell you that I
am giving you good advice."</p>
<p>"It was rather hard lines," Rose remarked, smiling up at
him.</p>
<p>The change in the boy's face was almost amazing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg
184]</a></span>"You see, I was ninety-eight," he explained, "and
that's the seventh half-crown I've lost following, just on the
last stroke--Miss Mindel--I say--would you sing something?"</p>
<p>Rose got up and made her way to the piano, followed by the
young man. For a moment I saw precisely the look in Miss
Duncombe's dark eyes as had flashed in her brother's a few
minutes before, a look, I fancied, of patient but subdued
malevolence. Almost as I realised it, however, it passed. She
motioned me to sit by her side.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lister," she said, "I envy you your profession. I think
that anything in the world must be better than being bear-leader
to a boy like Arthur."</p>
<p>"Your brother seems to have quite a great deal of influence
over him," I observed.</p>
<p>"As much as any one could have, perhaps," she agreed. "After
all, what can one expect? You can't make bricks without straw,
and it's hard to give even the appearance of a gentleman to the
son of a Welsh miner. Look at him now!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg
185]</a></span>Arthur was standing by the piano, listening to
Rose, who had commenced to sing. He was awkward, self-conscious
and ill at ease. He kept on thrusting his hands into his pockets
and taking them out again. There was an expression in his eyes
which angered me.</p>
<p>"I suppose he's rather a handful," I said.</p>
<p>Duncombe, who had been strolling about the room, joined us
just in time to hear the last remark.</p>
<p>"He is that," he admitted, "and yet, after all, I suppose I
ought not to grumble. I'm well enough paid for looking after him.
A word with you, Lister."</p>
<p>He drew me away to the farther end of the room. We stepped out
of the open window on to the broad gravel path. It was a soft,
dark night, with jagged masses of black cloud stretched across
the sky. Below us was the sandy beach, and away westwards we
could hear the waves crashing amongst the rocks of the
Greymarshes Bay.</p>
<p>"It's like this, you see, Lister," Duncombe began, speaking a
little jerkily and watching me closely. "I've an agreement to
look after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id=
"Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> this cub for five years--a
thousand a year and every mortal expense. I must say the lawyers
are generous about expenses. I don't mind admitting that they
cover the whole cost of my housekeeping, and I'm able to save
practically the lot. I'm going in for fruit farming when the job
comes to an end, but the boy's health is uncertain. I can't help
wondering what would happen to me if he were to die."</p>
<p>"I suppose," I ventured, "that your job would come to an
end."</p>
<p>"I couldn't afford that," Duncombe declared. "I want to secure
against it if I can. You're a stranger. You can look at this
matter with an open mind. What do you think about insuring his
life for, say, five or ten thousand pounds?"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't think of it," I told him bluntly, "while the boy
is under your charge."</p>
<p>He seemed disappointed, but he nodded understandingly.</p>
<p>"Strikes you like that, does it?" he sighed. "Well, I was
afraid it might. I expect you're right, too. Reminiscent of the
Ardalmont mystery, and all that sort of thing, eh?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg
187]</a></span>"As you say," I assented, a little grimly.</p>
<p>The three of us were inclined to be gloomy during our walk
home.</p>
<p>"I don't know why," Rose said, "but I detest that
household."</p>
<p>"They're all right in their way," Leonard observed dubiously,
"but they seem all of them to hate their job so. If they're paid
for looking after that young cub, they ought to stomach their
prejudices and do it."</p>
<p>"I don't like him," Rose pronounced abruptly. "I thought he
was just simple and foolish at first, but I've come to the
conclusion that I don't like him. There isn't a single member of
the household I do like. They're just sordid and peevish. I think
the chief might have found us something better to do."</p>
<p>"Perhaps he looks upon this in the light of a holiday task," I
suggested.</p>
<p>Rose had a flash of inspiration just then. She passed her arm
through mine, and notwithstanding the warm wind, she shivered a
little.</p>
<p>"There is just one person in that household," she said, "of
whom I am terrified."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg
188]</a></span>"Who is it?" Leonard asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>"Wait," she begged.</p>
<p>A few days later, we were invited to a picnic party at
Greymarshes Bay to celebrate Arthur's supposed twentieth
birthday. Duncombe had hired a little petrol launch, and we took
our lunch and bathing clothes along the coast. It was a hot,
almost breathless day, and we entered the water eagerly for our
pre-luncheon bathe. Every one except Mrs. Scatterwell bathed, and
she busied herself with one of the servants, preparing luncheon
in a shady spot. Somehow or other, perhaps because of the
brilliancy of the weather, every one was in better spirits. Even
Duncombe and his pupil seemed to be on quite good terms. They
vied with one another in diving feats, and Arthur, exulting in
his one accomplishment, clambered up the rocks more than once to
a considerable height, before he made his plunge. Presently,
however, we all tired a little of the sport. Rose was already
dressing in a convenient cave. I was lying at full length,
enjoying a sun bath on the shingle, when I heard Dun<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg
189]</a></span>combe's voice from behind a great rocky promontory
jutting out from the sea a little to my left.</p>
<p>"One more, Arthur. I've found a new place. It's the best of
the lot."</p>
<p>I watched the young man climb obediently up the jagged boulder
of rock. The topmost ledge must have been at least twenty or
thirty feet high, and he was well on his way to it, with his back
turned to me, when I became conscious of a queer feeling of
apprehension. The space of water into which Arthur was to plunge
was out of my sight, but there was a little foam at the corner,
and I remembered how once on a stormy day I had stood and seen
the broken waves thunder along this opening. I rose to my feet,
waded in as far as I could, and swam on my side towards the
promontory. Arthur by now had reached the summit and was
cautiously scrambling to his feet. There was no sign anywhere of
Duncombe. I swam on a few more strokes, until I was suddenly
conscious of a current. I swam round it, until I was directly
facing Arthur,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id=
"Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> now standing upright and
commencing to poise.</p>
<p>"Wait a moment, Arthur," I called out.</p>
<p>"Get out of the way, then," he replied. "I'm coming over.
Where's Duncombe?"</p>
<p>I looked around but there was no sign of him, yet I knew very
well that he could not be more than a few yards away.</p>
<p>"One moment, Arthur," I shouted back.</p>
<p>He dropped his arms and stood there impatiently. The water
beneath me was a green colour, full and sullen, but there were
little eddies which I could not understand considering the width
of the channel. Then, with a shock which, notwithstanding the hot
sun, brought a shiver of fear through my body, I discovered the
truth. Scarcely three feet under water was a long line of jagged
rock. I turned over on my back and held up my hand.</p>
<p>"Arthur!"</p>
<p>"Get out of the way, will you?" he shouted. "I'm coming."</p>
<p>His hands were already upraised. There was no time for
anything but the truth.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg
191]</a></span></p>
<p>"Don't be a fool," I answered. "There's a submerged rock right
across here. You couldn't miss it. Climb down, do you hear?"</p>
<p>His arms fell to his sides. For a single moment he stood
there, immovable. Not even his youth, his bathing costume, and
the clear background of blue sky and sunlit air could lend him
any grace of form or outline. He seemed, indeed, from his short
neck and hunched shoulders, as he turned away, almost deformed. I
looked all around. There was no sign anywhere of Duncombe. I
raised my voice and shouted.</p>
<p>"Hello, Duncombe!"</p>
<p>I heard a splash, as though he had slipped off the ledge of
the rock behind me. Presently he came swimming round the
corner.<br>
<br></p>
<p><a id="pic3" name="pic3"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
<br>
<div align="center"><img src=
"1203481h-images/The7Conundrums3.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration"></div>
<br>
<p>"What's the matter?" he shouted. "And where's Arthur?"</p>
<p>"He's climbing down from that rock," I answered, as Duncombe
came alongside. "I've just stopped his diving into this
pool."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>He was by my side now and I pointed down<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg
192]</a></span>wards to the dark line of cruelly jagged rock. He
looked for a moment concerned.</p>
<p>"Jove, I've never noticed those!" he muttered.</p>
<p>"They're barely three feet," I answered. "I can reach
them."</p>
<p>Duncombe turned over on his back. We were in the shadow,
almost surrounded by rocks. The voices of the others, preparing
the lunch, sounded a long way away. I suddenly felt as though I
were cut off, as though I could read the thoughts at the back of
this man's brain, as though I myself were in danger. All the time
he was drawing a little closer to me.</p>
<p>Leonard and Ella Duncombe suddenly appeared upon the summit of
one of the lower ranges of rocks.</p>
<p>"Come along to lunch," the former shouted.</p>
<p>The moment had passed. Duncombe began to swim vigorously for
the shore. He was quite himself when he stepped out on to the
sand.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't make a fuss about that, if I were you, Lister," he
suggested. "It looks as though I weren't careful enough. As
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg
193]</a></span> matter of fact, I don't think the boy would have
come to any harm."</p>
<p>Arthur was seated by himself on the sands, his arms clenched
around his knees, his face turned away from all of us. He seemed
to have ignored the summons to prepare for lunch.</p>
<p>"Probably not," I answered, trying to speak in as unconcerned
a tone as possible. "Boys and drunken men have a wonderful knack
of avoiding accidents."</p>
<p>We strolled up the beach together. Duncombe paused and spoke
to Arthur.</p>
<p>"Come along," he said, "they're waiting luncheon for us."</p>
<p>Arthur turned and looked at him. I could not say that there
was anything either malicious or reproachful in that look, and
yet it worried me. He made no answer in words. A few moments
later, however, he scrambled to his feet and went to the rock
behind which his clothes were lying.</p>
<p>Duncombe seemed determined that nothing which had happened
should interfere with the success of the picnic. He abandoned all
his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg
194]</a></span> reserve, related anecdotes, chaffed everybody in
turn, opened wine, and absolutely created an atmosphere of
pleasure. Leonard told stories and Rose sang to us and danced
upon the sands. Arthur, after a preliminary fit of gloom, drank
far too much champagne for his age and became, in his rather
clumsy way, as light-hearted as the rest. He and Ella sat for
some time apart from the others, his arm drawn through hers,
until presently they wandered off together to look for Venetian
shells, the spoils of some long-forgotten shipwreck. On the
whole, the excursion which I had seen foredoomed to failure,
turned out a great success. Duncombe only once, during the rest
of the afternoon, referred to the disturbing subject.</p>
<p>"You don't suppose," he suggested, "that Arthur is thinking
any more about that little affair, eh?"</p>
<p>"Why should he?" I answered coolly. "He must know that you
made a mistake."</p>
<p>"Naturally," Duncombe assented. "I still don't think he'd have
come to any harm unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195"
id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> he bungled his dive, but I'm
glad, all the same, that you noticed the rocks."</p>
<p>That marked the end of the incidents worthy of note connected
with the picnic, except that Arthur and Ella stayed away for over
an hour, and that when they returned she was clinging to his arm
with an almost protective air. That night, for the first time,
not a single member from the Grange turned up at our
performance.</p>
<p>Somehow or other, when I started for my customary early
morning walk on the following day, I knew that there was tragedy
in the air. A strange mist, presage of storm and heat, hung like
an oppressive curtain over the land and stretched out seawards. I
almost regretted, as I stood at the end of the little jetty, that
I had not departed from my usual custom and bathed. The thought
made me look back towards the shore. Duncombe, in his dressing
gown, had just left the gardens of the Grange and was descending
the shingle to the sands. I watched him throw off his gown and
wade into the water. Presently he turned on his side and began
swimming slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id=
"Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> out. Watching him, I felt more
than ever inclined to go and fetch my own bathing clothes. Then,
as I hesitated, I noticed Arthur, following through the Grange
gardens, scramble down the shingle, throw off his dressing gown
and also plunge into the sea. Something a little furtive about
the manner in which he made his way across the lawn, keeping
always to the side of the hedge as though to escape observation,
and his subsequent almost crawling progress along the shingle,
puzzled me. I had been down here many mornings, but I had never
seen Arthur bathing before. He was in the water now, and swimming
out with long, powerful strokes towards Duncombe.</p>
<p>Whilst Arthur was still almost undistinguishable in the sea,
and Duncombe was lying lazily on his back, as yet unconscious of
his pupil's approach, I began to feel my first misgivings. There
was something unnatural in the very atmosphere that morning, the
sulphurous gloom, the entire absence of sunshine, the still, oily
water. I found myself straining my eyes to catch a nearer glimpse
of the boy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id=
"Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> face, asking myself all the time
why he had chosen this particular morning to bathe for the first
time before breakfast. Nearer and nearer he came. He passed me
within a matter of fifty yards, but he took no notice of my shout
of greeting. Then, as he rolled from side to side, I caught a
glimpse of his face. He seemed to be swimming in entire
unconsciousness of any physical effort. His chin was a little
protruded, his eyes were fixed in an unnatural stare upon the
spot where Duncombe lay floating. For a moment or two I felt a
queer sensation of helplessness. I called out again, and I knew
this time, although I would not acknowledge it to myself, that my
cry was meant to be a warning to Duncombe. He heard me, turned
over on his side, and to my horror began to swim away from the
approaching form, to swim away like a man in fear.</p>
<p>I really did all that a man could do. Attached by a rope to
the end of the jetty were several rowing boats. I unfastened one,
clambered down some steps and jumped into it. As I swung it
round, I was just in time to see the boy alter his pace a little,
as though to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id=
"Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> intercept Duncombe, who had made
for the jetty. Duncombe, seeing himself cut off, hesitated. I
held up my hand and shouted.</p>
<p>"Hullo, there!" I bawled. "Hullo! Duncombe, I'm coming to take
you in."</p>
<p>Arthur took not the slightest notice of me. He was now within
a yard or so of Duncombe, and he suddenly seemed to raise himself
from the water. I had no doubt whatever then but that this was
tragedy. His mouth was opened, and his rather prominent teeth
showed in a wholly animal fashion. His eyes seemed like specks of
fire. He was by the side of Duncombe now, and from where I was I
can only say that it seemed to me as though he sprang at him just
as a sea cat might have done, if such a creature had ever
existed. His arms went round the other man's neck, his legs
around his loins. Then for the first time Duncombe cried out, a
horrible cry, the cry of a man face to face with a hideous death,
a cry which died away only as the water filled his mouth. Very
slowly, Duncombe struggling in the other's pitiless clasp like a
weakling in the grip of an octopus, the two bodies
disappeared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id=
"Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> I rowed about for more than half
an hour without seeing a sign of either. They were washed up two
days later.</p>
<h3>* * * * *</h3>
<p>The supper at a Midland Hotel, where our chief bade us meet
him a few evenings later, was one of the least festive of all our
meetings. Our depression was so noticeable that he presently
commented upon it.</p>
<p>"For whom this sorrow?" he enquired coldly. "For the tutor or
his charge?"</p>
<p>"For the boy," Rose declared. "After all, he was very
young."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry for Duncombe," Leonard admitted frankly. "Whatever
he'd been up to, it was the most horrible death any one could
die."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry for both," I insisted. "I think that somehow we
ought to have prevented it."</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson looked at us, one by one, out of his bright
piercing eyes. It was obvious that he was out of sympathy with
us.</p>
<p>"I continually forget," he said coldly, "that I have to deal
with sentimentalists. No person who looked upon life from a sane
point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id=
"Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> view, and who possessed full
knowledge of all the facts, could possibly regret the departure
of either of them."</p>
<p>"Was Duncombe's story really true?" Rose asked.</p>
<p>"This one is, at any rate," our host replied. "Arthur Dompers
was the orphan son of a Welsh miner. When he was fourteen years
of age, a relative in America died intestate and this boy was
discovered to be the heir. Some lawyers in London were entrusted
with the charge of him. He was sent to four private schools, from
each one of which he was expelled. Three tutors one by one
relinquished the task of training him up in the way he should go.
Duncombe was the fourth."</p>
<p>"Tell us about Mr. Duncombe, please," Rose begged.</p>
<p>"Duncombe was one of those criminals who are too clever to
come under the ban of the law," Thomson continued. "He was also a
person against whom I had a very strong grievance. When I heard
that the boy, Arthur Dompers, had been committed to his charge, I
felt that, if carefully watched, Duncombe's<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
time had come at last. By some irony of fate, the fortune left to
Arthur Dompers became trebled and quadrupled in the hands of his
trustees. Duncombe's appetite for plunder, already insatiable,
must have become a fever. He was clever, though. He bided his
time. For three years he had charge of Arthur Dompers, and during
that three years he improved him immensely. It was perfectly
clear what he was waiting for--for the only period when the boy
could be of real service to him--namely after his twenty-first
birthday. He made his plans a long way ahead. With great cunning
he kept secret the day of the boy's majority. You attended a
picnic, I think--a birthday party?"</p>
<p>"It was supposed to be his twentieth birthday," Leonard
observed.</p>
<p>"In reality his twenty-first," Thomson went on. "On the
morning of that day, the boy made his will, leaving the bulk of
his estate to Ella Duncombe, and large legacies to the rest of
the family. He also left a letter addressed to Ella Duncombe, in
which he made clear the relations between them and spoke
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg
202]</a></span> their impending marriage. With those documents in
his possession, Duncombe had no more use for the boy. There is no
doubt, from your report, Lister, that he deliberately made his
first attempt upon his life on that very morning. There is no
doubt, also, that the boy, half-witted though he was, in his
sullen way saw through the whole thing. His hate for Duncombe
became a slow-burning passion--and there, I think, is the story
of the tragedy."</p>
<p>"And the will?" I asked.</p>
<p>"It was committed to the flames on the morning of the tragedy
by Duncombe's sister--also the letter. The estate goes to the
Crown."</p>
<p>Rose sighed.</p>
<p>"All that money and no one any better off!"</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"The lawyers to the estate," he told us, "have made over ten
thousand pounds to the Duncombe family."</p>
<p>I took my courage into my hands.</p>
<p>"I know your attitude towards questions, sir," I said, "but I
feel bound to ask you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id=
"Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> one concerning this episode. What
on earth did you expect to gain by bringing us in touch with
it?"</p>
<p>Our host sipped his wine thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"I do not welcome questions," he admitted, "but bearing in
mind the fact that this affair has been without any features of
interest for you, I will reply. I knew perfectly well that
Duncombe would make some attempt upon the life of Arthur Dompers.
You were there to watch for it. You succeeded. Your report would
have released the boy from Duncombe's control. Events, however,
marched too quickly."</p>
<p>"On whose behalf, then, were we acting," Leonard asked, "you
and all of us? Were we philanthropists or detectives?"</p>
<p>Our host shrugged his shoulders and helped himself to a
cigar.</p>
<p>"That," he replied, "will be Conundrum Number
Five."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg

<h2>CONUNDRUM #6.&mdash;THE DUKE'S DILEMMA</h2>
<h3>First published in <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, Apr 1921</h3>
<p class="first">"How does one address a duke?" Rose asked,
looking up from the depth of her easy-chair.</p>
<p>"No idea," I replied. "I don't suppose we shall see anything
of him."</p>
<p>"I only knew one," Leonard murmured reminiscently. "He was at
Harrow and we used to call him Tubby."</p>
<p>"I don't see that that's going to help us," Rose remarked.
"However----"</p>
<p>Then the door of our sitting room opened and to our surprise
our host entered. He bowed to Rose and nodded to us in friendly
fashion.</p>
<p>"Very good of you to come down here and help us along," he
said, pleasantly ignoring the fact that we were being paid fifty
pounds a week and our expenses to help provide his<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
guests with entertainment. "I hope you're quite comfortable?"</p>
<p>We all three murmured an unqualified affirmative. The
arrangements made for our comfort were indeed beyond
criticism.</p>
<p>"You're not any relation to the Cotton who started bowling
googlies for Harrow in his last term, I suppose?" the Duke
queried, addressing Leonard.</p>
<p>Leonard modestly pleaded guilty, and our host showed his first
signs of real interest.</p>
<p>"You'll play for the Castle this afternoon?" he begged. "We're
playing the rest of the County, and they're bringing a pretty hot
side. Our batting's all right but our bowling's rotten."</p>
<p>"I haven't played for two years," Leonard said, a little
doubtfully.</p>
<p>"At three o'clock," the Duke announced, ignoring Leonard's
hesitation. "You'll find a couple of pros down at the nets if you
want a knock first. Don't give your bowling away too much, as
some of the enemy are prowling around."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg
207]</a></span>Our host took gracious leave of us. Rose watched
him curiously.</p>
<p>"Maurice," she observed, as the door closed, "there's
something queer about this place."</p>
<p>"I suppose there must be," I admitted, "or we shouldn't be
here."</p>
<p>"Exactly what are our instructions?" Leonard enquired.</p>
<p>"Vague," I replied. "The only letter I received from our chief
told me to accept the offer through Keith Prowse, to come here,
to sit tight and study conditions."</p>
<p>"What did he mean by 'conditions'?" Rose asked.</p>
<p>"Just get in touch with our environment, I suppose. For
instance, here we are with half a dozen others, brought up to
Westmoreland to amuse the Duke's house party. We are being
treated royally, the house party seems to comprise some of the
best-known names in England, and the whole thing seems to be
marvellously done."</p>
<p>"But so far no glimmering as to how or where we may come in?"
Leonard persisted.</p>
<p>"Not the slightest," I admitted. "Of<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
course, this place is a perfect treasure house. They say that the
jewels alone are insured for more than two millions. There may be
some robbery scheme on."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," Rose suggested, "we are to be the thieves. In that
case, I'll keep one of the famous pink pearls if I have to
swallow it."</p>
<p>I looked out across the park and a certain feeling of
depression stole over me. We were alone in a little sitting room
which had been made over to our exclusive use.</p>
<p>"I can't help wishing," I confessed, "that we knew a little
more where we stood. We've been working for Mr. Thomson now for
the best part of a year, and there isn't one of us three can tell
whether we've been helping the greatest crook the world has ever
known, or a master detective."</p>
<p>"I'm not sure that I care," Rose said sweetly.</p>
<p>Leonard helped himself to a cigarette.</p>
<p>"When I think of that night at Cromer," he reflected--"you
remember how wet it was, how the wind howled, and we hadn't
enough fire in our lodgings, or enough money<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> to
buy food?--when I think of those days and realise how life has
changed since our mysterious god came out of the machine, I feel
very much like Rose. I feel like a pagan, Maurice. We're back
again in our old lives, wearing the right sort of clothes, eating
and drinking like civilised beings, travelling in comfort, and
with a bank account growing all the time. It's good enough for
me."</p>
<p>"And for me," Rose echoed.</p>
<p>I fell in with their mood. After all, the sun was shining and
a long summer's day lay before us.</p>
<p>"Begone, dull care," I invoked, "at any rate until our next
letter of instructions arrives. Into flannels, Leonard, and then
to the nets. I suppose they'll let me have a knock."</p>
<p>"I shall come and watch," Rose decided graciously.</p>
<p>Our entertainment at Lorringham Castle was in its way
princely. We had a suite of rooms to ourselves, and a dining room
which we shared with Charles Jacoty, the leader of the Duke's
private orchestra, David Faraday,<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> the famous
illusionist, a Mrs. Middleham, widow of the Duke's private
chaplain, who arranged the dance programmes and painted the
menus, and a young man--Gerald Formby--the son of Sir James
Formby, the agent to the estate, who presided at the dinner table
and from whom we heard most of the gossip of the place. It was on
the evening after the cricket match that we received from him the
first inkling as to what the nature of our mission might be.</p>
<p>"Have you seen the Lorringham treasures yet?" he asked
Rose.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>"I don't even know what they are."</p>
<p>The young man appeared incredulous.</p>
<p>"You mean to say that you haven't heard of the Lorringham
pearls and the seven tiaras?"</p>
<p>"I've heard of them vaguely," she replied. "I didn't even know
that they were on view."</p>
<p>Jacoty leaned a little forward in his chair. Faraday also
appeared to be interested. The young man lowered his voice a
little. There was inherited awe in its inflexion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg
211]</a></span>"The Lorringham pink pearls," he said, "are the
most famous in history, although they are very seldom seen. They
were last worn, in fact, by Eleanor, Duchess of Lorringham, at
Queen Victoria's wedding. The seven tiaras are famous throughout
the world. The earliest dates from the time of Charles the
First."</p>
<p>"And they are really on view?" Rose asked.</p>
<p>"Not to the public. Whenever there is a house party here, they
are generally shown to the guests."</p>
<p>"They are immensely valuable, these jewels?" Faraday
enquired.</p>
<p>"They are insured for two millions," was the young man's
portentous reply.</p>
<p>There was a little silence. I chanced to glance at Faraday,
and I was almost startled by the gleam in his sunken eyes. He sat
like a man in a brown study, tapping the tablecloth with his
fingers.</p>
<p>"Has any attempt at robbery ever been made?" Leonard
asked.</p>
<p>Gerald Formby shook his head.</p>
<p>"They are too well guarded," he said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg
212]</a></span>"It is interesting, this," Faraday remarked
quietly. "Are the jewels kept in safes?"</p>
<p>The young man smiled.</p>
<p>"The room in which they are is in itself a safe. There are
steel shutters to the windows, and steel safes let into the wall.
There is a man on guard outside, day and night, and the only key
in existence which could unlock the safes is in the possession of
the Duke himself."</p>
<p>My eyes met Leonard's. For the first time I understood the
only three words of admonition which we had received:</p>
<br>
<p class="note" style="text-align:left"><tt>Watch the
Duke.</tt></p>
<br>
<p>Faraday spoke what was in my own mind.</p>
<p>"That fact may do away with some risk," he observed, "but
isn't it rather a danger to his Grace? Fancy being in constant
possession of a key which secures a treasure like that!"</p>
<p>"And you mean to say that no one has ever made any attempt to
steal them?" Rose asked.</p>
<p>"Once only, twenty-two years ago, in the late Duke's time,"
Formby admitted. "A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id=
"Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> gang of burglars--they say that
Charles Peace was one of them--broke into the Castle, but they
never got anywhere near the room. Soon after that these shutters
were built, and the safes let into the wall, and quite recently
an American expert came over, who designed the lock. Robbery is
now an impossibility."</p>
<p>We gave our first performance later on that evening. The Duke
himself came up and congratulated us afterwards. He invited us to
join the rest of the guests, a courteous offer of which, however,
we did not avail ourselves.</p>
<p>"You will at least join my personally conducted party," he
suggested, turning to Rose, "and have a look at the Lorringham
treasures? I am taking a few of my guests there at eleven
o'clock. I shall expect you three."</p>
<p>We accepted that invitation willingly enough, and the Duke
returned to his guests. Afterwards, Faraday gave one of the most
astonishing performances of sleight of hand I have ever seen.
With scarcely any appliances, he succeeded in puzzling everybody.
One of the guests, selected at random, was<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
made to disappear in such a fashion that he himself, when
questioned afterwards, was utterly confused about his experience.
Later on he brought a locked-up mastiff from his kennel and a
singing bird down from the top of the great hall. The Duke, with
several of his companions, came up to congratulate the
illusionist. Faraday received their compliments with the grave
pleasure of one who recognises his supremacy. As the Duke was
leaving, he addressed him.</p>
<p>"I heard your Grace inviting Miss Mindel and her companions to
inspect the treasure chamber to-night," he said. "May I be
permitted to accompany them?"</p>
<p>The Duke seemed on the point of giving a ready consent, then
suddenly he hesitated. He looked at Faraday with a dubious
smile.</p>
<p>"After that performance of yours, Mr. Faraday," he confessed,
"I really don't know what to say. I seem to have a horrible
vision of watching my tiaras come out through the steel doors,
and my pink pearls drop out from the ceiling into your waistcoat
pocket."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg
215]</a></span>Faraday did not smile. It seemed to me that he was
very much in earnest.</p>
<p>"I will undertake to refrain from any extempore performance,"
he said. "As a matter of fact, your Grace, there are limitations
to my magic."</p>
<p>The Duke turned away. He seemed rather to resent the other's
persistence.</p>
<p>"Another time, perhaps," he promised, a little coldly. "My
party to-night is made up."</p>
<p>Faraday was standing a little in the shadows and I watched him
eagerly. From that moment our mission to Lorringham Castle seemed
to become clearer to me.</p>
<p>An hour or so later, our host led a small company of us to the
treasure chamber. We paused outside a green baize door leading
into one of the galleries, which was guarded by a servant in the
livery of the house. The Duke, with a word of apology, took off
his coat and rolled up his shirt sleeves, disclosing a plain
platinum band around his arm.</p>
<p>"This is an American idea," he explained.</p>
<p>He touched a spring in the band, one side opened and disclosed
a key, attached to a thin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216"
id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> chain of platinum wire. With
this he unlocked the door of a small chamber, brilliantly lit.
One side of the room seemed to be composed, up to the height of
about six feet, of solid steel shutters. The Duke fitted the
other end of the key into a concealed crevice. There was a little
click, and the whole of the shutters rolled back. From behind
windows of solid plate-glass, on a background of black velvet,
were displayed the famous tiaras, rows of marvellous pearls, some
of them as large as marbles and pink as sea coral, and a further
collection of magnificent jewellery. There seemed to be an almost
universal gasp of astonishment. The women of the party especially
were speechless.</p>
<p><a id="pic4" name="pic4"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
<br>
<div align="center"><img src=
"1203481h-images/The7Conundrums4.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration"></div>
<p>"We keep them like this instead of in coffers," the Duke
explained, "so that they can be shown without being handled."</p>
<p>"Supposing you wanted to get at them?" some one asked.</p>
<p>"There is a secret spring," he replied, "which releases these
windows. You should look at the diamonds in that Queen Anne
tiara, Lady Mordaunt," he added, turning to <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>one
of his guests. "The greatest diamond expert in the world, who was
here last year, declared that he had never seen stones to match
those in his life."</p>
<p>We gazed, we admired, we marvelled. In a few minutes the show
was over, the doors locked, the key back in its wonderful hiding
place, and the Duke's coat once more hanging from his shapely
shoulders.</p>
<p>"I don't wear this platinum affair except when I am down
here," he told us. "The rest of the time I leave it at my
banker's. Tell me what you are thinking about, Miss Mindel?" he
asked, turning to her with a smile.</p>
<p>Rose answered him frankly.</p>
<p>"I was wondering why you wouldn't let Mr. Faraday come with
us."</p>
<p>The Duke frowned slightly.</p>
<p>"Well," he admitted, "I suppose it was foolish of me. All the
same, the man's performance took away my breath. Of course," he
went on, "I know that it was all illusion, and yet it doesn't
seem to me any more wonderful to think of his thrusting his hand
through my plate-glass windows and helping<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
himself to my pearls, than to perform some of the feats he
achieved this evening. The guardianship of several million
pounds' worth of family treasures," he concluded, with an
apologetic smile, "sometimes tends to make one unreasonable."</p>
<p>Leonard and I turned into the little smoking room assigned to
our use, after we had said good night to Rose. Faraday was seated
there alone, with a block and pencil in his hand, apparently
making idle sketches. He laid the block by his side, face
downwards, at our entrance.</p>
<p>"Well," he said, a little ill-naturedly, "I suppose you've
seen the treasures?"</p>
<p>"We have," I admitted, helping myself to a whisky and
soda.</p>
<p>"Are they as wonderful as report says?" he enquired.</p>
<p>"I'm no judge," I told him, a little shortly.</p>
<p>"By the bye, there's a note for you on the table."</p>
<p>I recognised at once the familiar, typewritten envelope--a
message from the chief.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219"
id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> Leonard looked over my shoulder
as I tore open the envelope:</p>
<br>
<p class="note" style="text-align:left"><tt>Watch Faraday.
Suspect Edwards, one of the custodians. Registered post to-morrow
brings you key of door leading to balcony, end of north
gallery.</tt></p>
<br>
<p>I tore the note into small pieces. Faraday sat watching me
with gloomy curiosity.</p>
<p>"Nothing annoying, I hope?" he queried.</p>
<p>I watched the pieces filter through my fingers into the
waste-paper basket.</p>
<p>"Nothing of any importance," I assured him.</p>
<p>The next day several things happened. In the first place, the
key of the door leading to the little gallery facing the jewel
chamber arrived, wrapped in tissue paper and with an obliterated
postmark. Secondly, I took five wickets for fifteen against the
team brought over from a neighbouring country house, and Leonard,
by indefensible slogging, managed to knock up fifty-five before
he was caught on the boundary. These last two episodes seemed to
obliterate all memory of the professional character of our stay.
The Duke, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id=
"Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> played a very useful innings
himself, and whose joy at winning the match was almost like a
schoolboy's, treated us as honoured guests and insisted upon all
three of us accepting his invitation to dine in the great hall
that evening. The third event of the day was the coming of the
Princess Anne of Chantilly, the last representative of a famous
French family, a great heiress, related to royalty, and one of
the beauties of the world. The three of us chanced to witness her
arrival, and our host's secret was manifest in the first few
minutes. In her presence he seemed rejuvenated. He watched her
every movement. The slight austerity of his tone and deportment
vanished as though by magic. A new and more genial side of him
appeared. He paid his court almost openly. It did not need the
gossip of the place to tell us that he was her suitor.</p>
<p>I was ready for dinner early that evening and strolled up and
down the north gallery, waiting for Rose, who was naturally
taking some pains with her toilette. I made my way as though by
accident to the notice board containing the names of the watchmen
selected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id=
"Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> from the menservants of the
establishment. There were eleven altogether, and the watch for
the next twenty-four hours had just been put in. For the first
time I saw there the name of Edwards. He was on duty, it seemed,
from three to six on the following morning. I felt a little
shiver of excitement as I strolled away, after a surreptitious
glance at the little gallery. The beginning of my task was close
at hand.</p>
<p>Dinner that night was a pageant rather than a meal. Sixty-four
of us sat down at a long table, the decoration of which with
hothouse flowers had taken two gardeners the greater part of the
day. We were served from gold plate and we drank strange wines
from Venetian glasses. The Duke sat at one end of the table, with
the Princess at his right hand, and his sister, the Marchioness
of Leicestershire, sat at the other end. The Princess, of whom I
had a good view, was one of the most beautiful women I had ever
seen. She was fair and slim, with a perfect complexion, dark,
rather tired eyes, a fascinating mouth, and corn-coloured hair,
whose seemingly simple arrangement was an artistic triumph. The
one re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg
222]</a></span>markable thing about her, though, was that she
wore not a single article of jewellery. Her neck and bosom were
bare, her fingers were ringless. I ventured to remark upon this
fact to my neighbour, whose acquaintance I had made on the
cricket field. She glanced down the table and nodded.</p>
<p>"The Princess has strange fancies," she remarked. "I have seen
her wearing the Chantilly emeralds at a small dinner party, and
afterwards go to a Court function wearing the jewels of an
ing&eacute;nue."</p>
<p>I looked back at her with a very genuine admiration.</p>
<p>"She ought to marry the Duke," I whispered, "if only for the
sake of wearing the wonderful pink pearls."</p>
<p>My companion smiled.</p>
<p>"She would look better in them than any woman in the world,"
she agreed. "The pity of it is that she would only be able to
wear them up here, and for a woman of her cosmopolitan tastes,
Westmoreland would seem a little confining."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg
223]</a></span>"But if she were Duchess of Lorringham?"</p>
<p>My companion shook her head.</p>
<p>"The jewels are a very solemn family trust," she told me. "I
believe I am right in saying that they cannot be taken out of the
United Kingdom. One of the famous tiaras was stolen about a
hundred years ago in London, and the deed of trust was amended
then. I suppose it is quite all right," she went on meditatively,
"but in a way it seems a cruel thing to keep jewels of such value
practically hidden."</p>
<p>We gave our little entertainment that evening, after which a
great pianist who had travelled down from London gave a recital,
Faraday made more magic, and a girl, who was one of the house
party, danced. All the time our host never left the Princess's
side. There was no doubt at all but that he was deeply in love
with her. She, for her part, won all hearts. She was gracious and
charming to every one. She seemed, indeed, to the Duke's delight,
to almost assume at times the position of gracious chatelaine. A
thought came to me during the evening and I sought<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
out young Formby, with whom Leonard and I had become quite
intimate. I found him with some of the younger spirits in the
billiard room. I drew him on one side whilst he was waiting to
play his shot at pool.</p>
<p>"Formby," I said, "I don't want to seem impertinent but I
should like to ask you a question."</p>
<p>"Go ahead," the young man invited.</p>
<p>"Is the Duke a rich man?" I asked.</p>
<p>Formby looked at me in astonishment.</p>
<p>"What on earth makes you ask a question like that?" he
demanded curiously.</p>
<p>"Well, I really haven't any reason," I hastened to assure him.
"I just wondered, that's all."</p>
<p>"The Duke," he told me impressively, "is one of the richest
men in England. He spends money in a princely fashion but he has
never yet succeeded in spending half his income. What about a
game of snooker--you and Cotton, too, if he likes? We are
breaking up after this. Sir Charles wants to dance."</p>
<p>I left Cotton there and went in search of Rose. I found her on
the balcony in our own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225"
id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> sitting room, looking down at
the guests--strange, picturesque figures as they strolled about
the moon-dappled lawn, listening to the music.</p>
<p>"Maurice," she asked me, as I sank into a chair by her side,
"have you found out yet what we are here for?"</p>
<p>"I haven't the faintest idea," I replied. "The chief has been
even less communicative than usual. It seems to have something to
do with the jewels and that is all I know."</p>
<p>"You don't think," she went on nervously, "that by any chance
we are sent here to aid in any attempt to steal them?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't think that," I assured her. "Where the chief
stands sometimes I can't quite make up my mind, but I don't think
a jewel robbery, even on such a scale as this, is quite in his
line. If our presence here has anything to do with jewels at all,
and I think it has," I added, dropping my voice, "I should say
that we were here indirectly to aid their guardians."</p>
<p>"Then why doesn't the Duke mention it to us?" she asked
curiously.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg
226]</a></span>"It's beyond me," I confessed.</p>
<p>She laid her hand upon my arm and drew me very near
indeed.</p>
<p>"Maurice," she whispered, "there's something wrong about
Faraday."</p>
<p>"Go on," I begged her.</p>
<p>"Well, for one thing, then, what does he want with a ninety
horse-power car, concerning which he hasn't said a word to any of
us? I saw him driving it in the lower stretches of the park this
morning."</p>
<p>"Well, that might be any man's hobby," I replied. "What
else?"</p>
<p>"I found him poring over a map this afternoon," she continued.
"I looked over his shoulder. It was a road map of Westmoreland,
and I am perfectly certain that he was tracing out the road from
here to the sea. It is only twenty miles."</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"Well," I said, "let us assume, then, that Faraday means to
make an attempt to steal the jewels, that he has a high-powered
car in readiness, and a boat of some sort waiting by the sea. I
dare say that part of it might be<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> managed all right.
It's a desolate coast, the road to it lies over a mountain range,
and he could easily start from a place where there is no
telephone or telegraph. But--it's the robbery itself that seems
to me so impossible. I can't conceive how any one could get at
the Duke's key, and, having got it, how they could pass the man
on duty at the door, to say nothing of leaving the Castle
afterwards."</p>
<p>"Most robberies seem like that until afterwards," Rose
answered, a little drily.</p>
<p>"Besides," I argued, "Faraday is, in his way, a famous man. He
must earn several thousands a year. Why should he run such
appalling risks?"</p>
<p>"Go and look at the <i>Era</i>, which I left on the
sitting-room table," she enjoined. "Look at the paragraph at the
bottom of the sixth page."</p>
<p>I obeyed her, and read with a little start of surprise of the
great deception accorded to Faraday at Melbourne the previous
week.</p>
<p>"What does it mean?" I asked Rose, when I returned.</p>
<p>"It means that this man isn't Faraday at<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
all," she declared. "I was doubtful of him from the first. I saw
Faraday at the Coliseum about two years ago, and I am sure that
he was a much older man."</p>
<p>"In that case," I said thoughtfully, "I suppose it is our duty
to warn the Duke."</p>
<p>"You must do as you think best," Rose decided.</p>
<p>I made my way reluctantly downstairs and turned into the
gardens where I was told the Duke was. I found him at the end of
a rose pergola. The Princess was seated by his side, and at the
sound of their voices I hesitated and would have turned back. The
Duke, however, recognised me and called out. In the bright
moonlight which was flooding the gardens, he seemed unnaturally
pale. His tone, too, when he addressed me, had lost its smooth,
pleasant intonation. He was like a man who has been undergoing
torture. The slight smile upon the Princess's lips chilled and
depressed me. I felt that it was not a pleasant interview which I
had disturbed.</p>
<p>"Were you looking for me, Lister?" the Duke asked.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg
229]</a></span>"In a sense I was, your Grace," I admitted.
"I--er--there was a little matter I thought I ought to mention to
you."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>I felt suddenly that my mission was ridiculous and my
suspicions intolerable. Since I was there, however, I had to go
through with it.</p>
<p>"The man Faraday, the illusionist," I began----</p>
<p>"Well, what about him?" the Duke interrupted sharply.</p>
<p>"Some one who saw Faraday perform at the Coliseum two years
ago," I continued, "is of opinion that this man is not Faraday at
all. The suspicion is confirmed by the fact that, according to
this week's <i>Era</i>, Faraday is performing in Melbourne."</p>
<p>"I have no doubt that your information is correct," the Duke
replied coldly. "Now I come to think of it, I believe the agents
told me that they were sending a Faraday man but not Faraday
himself. You surely had some reason for bringing me
this--information?"</p>
<p>The wild absurdity of the whole thing made<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> me
feel like a fool. Then I remembered, however, that we had been
deliberately sent here by our Machiavellian chief, and we had
never been sent anywhere in vain.</p>
<p>"It must sound idiotic, your Grace," I confessed, "but we were
all very much impressed by the precautions against robbery
connected with your jewel chamber. The fact that there was a man
staying here to whom you yourself preferred not to show the
jewels--staying here under a false name, with a ninety
horse-power motor car in the garage----"</p>
<p>The Duke interrupted me with a slight exclamation and a little
wave of the hand.</p>
<p>"I never dreamed that you were such an old woman, Lister," he
said. "I am much obliged to you for your warning," he added, with
some return of his old courtesy. "As it happens, however, I was
already aware that this man was not Faraday himself, and I fancy
that my precautions for guarding the Lorringham treasures are
adequate."</p>
<p>The Princess leaned a little forward. I sympathised with the
Duke. In this faint,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id=
"Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> enchanting light, she was
ravishingly beautiful.</p>
<p>"Do not be too confident, dear host," she murmured. "If women
were only made of sterner stuff, a lock has never been fashioned
which could keep a pearl lover from your jewel chamber."</p>
<p>The Duke smiled.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless," he added, turning to me with a friendly
gesture of dismissal, "you may sleep soundly to-night and as many
nights as you remain under my roof. The spells are not yet woven
which could charm those jewels from their cases."</p>
<p>I made my way back to the Castle, a little confused. There
seemed to be in the Duke's last words a subtle behest to me, a
warning not to concern myself further in his affairs. And from
three to six on this coming morning, Edwards was guard of the
chamber, and my r&ocirc;le of watcher was already
established.</p>
<p>It must have been within a few seconds of the chiming of a
quarter past three, that the intense silence of the gallery, into
which I had found my way without difficulty, was
broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg
232]</a></span> in even the slightest degree. Opposite where I
crouched, in a high-backed chair, with a glass of cold water by
his side, sat the custodian of the jewel chamber. A little to the
right was the narrow passage leading to the Duke's apartments.
Two electric lights were burning, and through one of the windows
came pale splashes of faint moonlight. The effect was a weird and
confusing illumination which made it hard to recognise even the
simplest objects. The armoured figures cast fantastic shadows
across the floor, the outline of the watching man seemed
distorted and unreal, and the whole setting of the little scene
was unnatural, a stimulus to nervous imagination. For this very
reason I covered my eyes and looked again for a moment at the
apparition which at first presented every semblance of the
impossible. The second time I knew that I had not been
deceived--I knew that something was happening.</p>
<p>The end of that little passage leading from the Duke's
apartments to the watching figure was wrapped in gloom. The faint
creaking which had first attracted my attention might<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
have come from an unseen door there, or it might have been the
not unnatural creaking of timbers in an old house. The sound,
however, was followed by a strange vision. I saw an arm stretched
out from the shadows, linger for a moment over the tumbler, and
then disappear. I rubbed my eyes. Was this Faraday and his toy
magic, or reality? I waited. It might have been ten minutes
before the next happening. The watcher in the chair stretched out
his arm, lifted the tumbler to his lips and drank. After that
there was silence again. Then from the spot where the arm had
come, a figure dressed in black stole out, the figure of a man of
medium height, without betraying collar or shirt front, black as
a bat save for the pale blur of an indistinguishable face, and
noiseless. He stooped over the custodian, now evidently either
asleep or unconscious. In a moment or two he stood upright,
paused before the door of the jewel chamber, and with a curious,
apparently effortless movement, passed through it. Then it seemed
to me that my time had come for action. I stole quietly down the
few stairs, unfastened the door of<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> the gallery, and
crept up the corridor. The door of the jewel chamber was ajar,
and through it I could see the shining of the electric light
inside, a glimmer of which fell upon the face of the drugged
custodian. Suddenly, upon the very threshold of the jewel
chamber, I stopped short. All my wariness was gone, lost in a
shock of surprise. A little exclamation broke from my lips. The
next second I found myself struggling for my life. The walls swam
round. I raised my voice and gave a great cry. After that there
was silence.</p>
<p>At twelve o'clock the next morning, with a bandage around my
head, and feeling still the effects of an almost delirious night,
I stepped into the car which was waiting to take us to the
station. The Duke, who was practising at the cricket nets, came
hurrying across to us, his bat still in his hand.</p>
<p>"I had no idea that you were going by this early train!" he
exclaimed. "So glad that I did not miss you altogether."</p>
<p>Rose murmured something polite, and Leonard said a word or two
about the pleasure of our stay. I remained silent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg
235]</a></span>"I am afraid," our host continued, smiling at me,
"that I was a little unsympathetic in the small hours of the
morning. I am never at my best when I am roused from sleep.
However, you must let me express my regrets to you now, Mr.
Lister, for your little accident. At the same time," he went on,
"I am sure you will agree with me that the neighbourhood of the
jewel chamber is rather a dangerous place for a man addicted to
nightmares to be wandering about at three o'clock in the
morning."</p>
<p>I looked the Duke in the face.</p>
<p>"What I saw was no nightmare," I said. "I saw some sort of
powder dropped into Edwards' glass, and I saw a man pass into the
jewel chamber."</p>
<p>The Duke smiled tolerantly.</p>
<p>"My dear Mr. Lister," he protested, "if the man Edwards had
been drugged as you suggest, could he have attacked you in the
way he did and got the better of you in a scrap? Further, how was
it possible for any one to open the door of the jewel chamber
without a key?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg
236]</a></span>He rolled up the sleeve of his flannel shirt a
little higher, touched the spring of his platinum bracelet,
showed us the key and replaced it. I said nothing. I continued to
watch the Duke's face.</p>
<p>"Perhaps the most satisfactory part of your hallucination," he
went on, "is the fact that the jewels have neither been disturbed
nor removed. I beg, Mr. Lister," he concluded indulgently, "that
you will not let this unfortunate incident disturb any agreeable
impressions you may have had of your stay here. It has been a
great pleasure to me to entertain you. If you will allow me to
refer for a moment to a business matter, my steward has sent a
cheque this morning to your agent. And if you will allow me to
offer you a slight memento of your stay here, I will ask you to
accept this bat from me. It is one of Wisden's, and I think the
best I have ever handled."</p>
<p>He held it out to me, and there passed between us one of those
long and silent glances which convey more than words. I held out
my hand and accepted the bat.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg
237]</a></span>"Thank you, Duke," I said.</p>
<p>He stood away and lifted his cap. Then we drove off.</p>
<h3>* * * * *</h3>
<p>Mr. Thomson had his own methods of surprising us. Three nights
after our return to town, we found ourselves, for instance, under
the great plane tree at Ranelagh, drinking wonderful yellow
chartreuse with our coffee, listening to the music and to the
little murmur of pleasant, after-dinner conversation. The moment
for which I had waited so eagerly had come at last.</p>
<p>"On this occasion," our host remarked tolerantly, "I feel that
I must be a little more lenient than usual as regards questions.
You came away from Lorringham a little puzzled, I have no
doubt?"</p>
<p>"We did indeed," I replied. "We want to know why the Duke was
engaged in a conspiracy to steal his own jewels, and why our
mission there seemed to be to prevent it."</p>
<p>"Quite a little romance," our host observed. "The Duke, as you
may have noticed, is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238"
id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> much in love with the Princess
of Chantilly. The Princess is one of those women in whom the love
of jewels amounts to a passion. The Lorringham pink pearls are,
as you may know, priceless. More than anything in the world the
Princess desires to wear those pearls."</p>
<p>"Then why doesn't she acquire them by marrying the Duke?" I
asked.</p>
<p>"Because," Mr. Thomson explained, "in the trust deed relating
to the jewels they can none of them be moved outside the United
Kingdom. The Princess would never live in England for more than a
month or so in the year, which means that she would be separated
from the jewels she loves for the greater part of the time. The
Duke has taken every sort of legal opinion, and there is no doubt
that if they were stolen from the Castle and returned to him in
some foreign country, there is no law which could compel him to
bring them back here. That is why the Duke connived at the theft,
which you prevented."</p>
<p>The elucidation was simple enough but scarcely
satisfactory.</p>
<p>"If I had known this," I confessed, "I'm<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
afraid my sympathies would have been with the Duke."</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson smiled indulgently.</p>
<p>"That proves, then," he said, "how wise I am to explain these
little affairs with which you chance to become associated,
afterwards instead of before. You were acting for the insurance
companies, who would have to pay a very large sum to the vested
estate if the jewels were stolen from Lorringham. On their
behalf," he added, handing me an oblong strip of paper, "I am
asked to hand you this cheque for five hundred pounds."</p>
<p>I passed it over to Leonard, who usually kept our
accounts.</p>
<p>"All the same," I observed, "I don't wonder the Duke thought I
was a meddlesome idiot."</p>
<p>"His Grace has probably forgiven you," Mr. Thomson remarked,
"for the Princess has relented at last. If you buy an evening
paper on your way home, you will see that they were married by
special license this afternoon."</p>
<p>We found plenty to think and talk about for the next few
minutes. Then Mr. Thomson,<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> who had been leaning
back in his chair, watching the stars and listening to the music,
electrified us.</p>
<p>"In one month," he said, "the year for which you pledged your
services to me will be up. At the end of that time we shall say
good-by."</p>
<p>"You will not want us again?" Rose asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson shook his head.</p>
<p>"Please do not consider that any reflection upon your
efforts," he begged. "During the last ten years I have had
assistants in every walk of life. No one has served me more
intelligently or on the whole more successfully than you three.
The fact of the matter is that I am going to retire."</p>
<p>"Retire from what?" I asked him impetuously. "Who are you?
What are you? I have never been able to make up my mind whether
we have been on the side of the sheep or the goats. How did you
become interested, for instance, in this last affair? Did the
insurance companies give you a brief? And if so, did they give it
to a master criminal, to police headquarters, or to a private
detective?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg
241]</a></span>"Shall we call that Conundrum Number Six?" Mr.
Thomson suggested, watching the ash on his cigar. "You
understand, of course, that we are going to have a grand finale.
You have a week in which to rest, and I think a study of your
banking account will prove that you are justified in taking a
holiday if you wish to. On next Thursday evening, at six o'clock,
I desire that all three of you will be at the rooms which you are
now occupying in Clarges Street. You will there receive a message
from me. I shall ask your help once more before I retire into
private life--and safety."</p>
<p>The music surged in our ears, and the froth of light
conversation filled the air. Of all the little groups of people
seated about, we alone seemed to have our faces set towards the
serious things. Perhaps our host noticed it, for he rose to his
feet and drew Leonard on one side.</p>
<p>"If I were your age, Lister," he said, turning to me, "I
should ask Miss Mindel to drift about with me in one of those
shadowy boats."</p>
<p>So Rose and I strolled down towards the lake.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg
242]</a></span>"To think," she murmured, a little tremulously,
"that very soon we shall come to the end of our adventures!"</p>
<p>I drew her arm through mine. The sound of the music was
growing fainter in the distance and the ripple of the water was
in our ears.</p>
<p>"Or to the beginning," I whispered.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg

<h2>CONUNDRUM #7.&mdash;THE GREATEST ARGUMENT</h2>
<h3>First published in <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, May 1921</h3>
<p class="first">The clock had scarcely finished striking six
when a two- seated car, throaty but sonorous, came to a
standstill in front of the house in Clarges Street where Rose,
Leonard and I had our temporary abode. An elegantly dressed but
weary young man was shown into our sitting room. He bowed to Rose
and addressed me.</p>
<p>"You're Maurice Lister, what, and Mr. Leonard Cotton?" he
began. "No use telling you my name because you wouldn't know it.
I've brought you a message."</p>
<p>I indicated a chair but our visitor shook his head.</p>
<p>"Got to be tooting off in a moment," he continued. "I have
just come from the old man. He's in a nursing home round the
corner."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg
244]</a></span>"What, Mr. Thomson?" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>The young man assented, although at the mention of the name he
winced.</p>
<p>"They nearly laid him out last night in Lansdowne Passage," he
announced. "Fortunately, I wasn't far away. Number 100, John
Street. He'd like you there in a quarter of an hour, Mr.
Lister."</p>
<p>"But who laid him out?" I asked. "Is he seriously hurt?"</p>
<p>Leonard intervened, holding out a newspaper.</p>
<p>"There's an account here!" he exclaimed. "'Murderous assault
in Lansdowne Passage.' They say the victim, name unknown, is in a
precarious condition."</p>
<p>"Was that really Mr. Thomson?" Rose demanded, in a shocked
tone.</p>
<p>"Less said, less trouble," the young man replied, embracing us
all in a common farewell salute. "So long."</p>
<p>He took his leave, lit a cigarette on the kerb, assumed an
almost horizontal position in the car, and shot like a rocket
into the heart of the Piccadilly traffic. In rather less
than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg
245]</a></span> five minutes I was ringing the bell at Number
100, John Street, and after a very brief delay was taken upstairs
to a cool and pleasantly furnished bedroom. Mr. Thomson, almost
undistinguishable for bandages, motioned to a chair by his
bedside and the nurse departed.</p>
<p>"They pretty nearly got me this time, Lister," he
remarked.</p>
<p>Curiosity mastered sympathy.</p>
<p>"Who did?" I asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson lay quite still, with his eyes fixed upon the
ceiling.</p>
<p>"A little company of men," he said, "who are dangerous fellows
to deal with--very dangerous," he repeated pensively.</p>
<p>"Are you badly hurt?"</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>"I am scarcely hurt at all."</p>
<p>"The newspapers," I began----</p>
<p>"Inspired."</p>
<p>"You are on the side of the law this time, then!" I exclaimed
triumphantly.</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>"I confess it. The newspapers which speak of my perilous
condition exaggerate. Never<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>theless," he went on,
"I have decided to spend a week here. The surroundings are
pleasant and the rest is good. During that week you will take my
place."</p>
<p>"The devil I shall!" I murmured, gazing at his head swathed
with bandages.</p>
<p>"One reason," Mr. Thomson condescended to explain, "for my
retirement from an active pursuit of--shall we call it my
hobby?--is that, notwithstanding my repeated efforts to keep it
in the background, my personality has become too well known
amongst the inner circle of those against whom our energies are
directed. In this present instance, the scene for a very stirring
little drama in the history of to-day is laid in a comparatively
small manufacturing town in the heart of Yorkshire. Whatever form
of disguise I might select, my presence in that place would
certainly be detected. Besides, the task before us is one in
which direct action is impossible. We can only bait the trap and
wait, and if the quarry refuses to enter, we must choose another
trap and another bait. A good deal will rest with you, Lister. If
you are completely successful<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> in the undertaking
which I shall presently disclose to you, you will receive a
parting gift of ten thousand pounds for division amongst the
three of you."</p>
<p>"It is princely," I acknowledged enthusiastically.</p>
<p>"If you succeed," Mr. Thomson continued, "it is a flea bite.
Now leave me. To-morrow you will depart for the Grand Hotel at
Blackham. Before midnight to-night you will receive from me a
written report which will contain all the information you
require. Read it, commit it to memory and destroy it. If you need
further advice or help, do not hesitate to apply to me. There is
a telephone here at my elbow, and I shall never be so ill as the
papers may lead you to believe. Good fortune to you!"</p>
<p>I left our chief and returned to Clarges Street, impressed
with a conviction that we were about to enter upon the most
important enterprise which had yet come our way.</p>
<h3>* * * * *</h3>
<p>We found Blackham hideous, uninspiring, yet not without a
certain impressiveness. It<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> was situated in the
midst of a district black with coal shafts and forges which
squatted upon the ground, festering sores in the daytime, like
drops from a spilt hell at night, when the roar of their flames
was like a fiery wind, and the red vomit of their furnaces
stained the very clouds. There were never-ending electric cars,
linking up a whole series of town-villages, more public houses
than I had ever seen before, a plethora of libraries and a
perfect plague of cinema palaces. Day and night the streets were
thronged. Food and living were inordinately dear but money was
plentiful, although everywhere there seemed brooding over the
place the shadow of that sullen storm of industrial unrest with
which in those days the whole country was agitated. The shops,
the cinema palaces, the theatre itself and the smaller music
halls were packed every night. We only obtained a hall for our
own performance with the utmost difficulty, and for our rooms and
sitting room at the so-called Grand Hotel, which was little more
than a glorified public house, we had to pay as much as though we
were at a West End hotel. We advanced the<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
price of the seats, however, at the building in which our
performance was given, and were rewarded by finding the place
packed on the first night. The only empty places were in the
cheaper seats.</p>
<p>Late that night, Leonard and I came across a very valuable
acquaintance, Arthur Rastall, a journalist on a London paper, a
man whom I had known for years and who hailed from Leonard's part
of the world. He visited our sitting room for a final whisky and
soda, and he helped us to understand the somewhat tense
atmosphere of the place.</p>
<p>"What on earth are you doing here?" was almost the first
question I asked him.</p>
<p>He filled his pipe and lit it.</p>
<p>"I am here," he replied, "because during the course of the
next few days history will be made in this most unattractive
town. I am not alone, either. Fisher is here from <i>The
Times</i>, Simpson from <i>The Post</i>, and I passed the
<i>Express</i> man in the town this afternoon."</p>
<p>"A Labour conference?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Something even more than that. These devils have got
something up their sleeves.<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> They have some
reason for meeting in a small place like this, and meeting
privately. There's something brewing."</p>
<p>"What sort of a something?" I asked. "Is it a secret from two
harmless strolling players?"</p>
<p>"No secret at all that I know of," our friend replied gruffly,
"except from the Government, who won't believe it, and Scotland
Yard, who don't know how to act. They say that Creslin is coming,
and two representatives from America."</p>
<p>I suppose I still looked a little puzzled, although what
Rastall was telling us was not altogether news. He went on after
a moment's pause.</p>
<p>"Every country," he explained, "has been able to deal with its
own Labour question more or less successfully, except Russia. The
greatest danger the world might have to face would be an
internationalisation of so-called Labour. Creslin is the apostle
of internationalisation."</p>
<p>"Do you mean Creslin, the Bolshevist?" Leonard demanded--"the
man whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id=
"Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> Prime Minister referred to as the
Horror of the World?"</p>
<p>"The same," was the grim admission.</p>
<p>"But how is it that that man is free to walk the streets of
any English town?" Leonard persisted. "I should have thought such
a criminal could have been shot anywhere."</p>
<p>"I don't think there is any offence against the English law
under which he could be charged," Rastall declared. "Every port
was watched, and they did try to keep him out of the country.
They hadn't a chance, though. He was far too clever for
them."</p>
<p>The story of Creslin's coming was already known to me, but I
asked Rastall a question which had been in my mind all the
time.</p>
<p>"Tell me what there is against the Government putting a bold
front on the matter, arresting Creslin, and deporting him as an
undesirable alien?"</p>
<p>"Just this. The whole country just now is in a dangerously
inflammatory state. The committees for settling Labour disputes
worked well enough at first, but so much of this false,
socialistic literature, anarchistic<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> stuff, has made its
way into the country during the last few years, that Labour, fat
and well-fed and surfeited with pleasure, is more dangerous
to-day than it was in the old days of starvation. Wages to-day
are an enormous tax upon capital, but you know what the screaming
Bolshevist is. He wants all the time to kill the goose that lays
the golden egg; he wants to pull down the capitalist and reign in
his stead. If ever he succeeded, as he did in Russia, England
would be industrially and commercially ruined."</p>
<p>"Yet even with that certainty before us, you mean to tell me
that the Government is going to let Creslin meet the heads of all
the trades unions here and pour his filth down their
throats?"</p>
<p>"Seems like it," was Rastall's laconic reply.</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door. The manager of the hotel
presented himself. Behind him stood another and a slighter
figure. The former glanced around the apartment and with a little
bow drew me on one side.</p>
<p>"Can I have a word with you, Mr. Lister?"</p>
<p>"Get right on with it," I invited.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg
253]</a></span>"I wondered if by any chance you could be induced
to give up your sitting room? It happens to be the only one I
have in the house, and we have a very distinguished visitor from
abroad, just arrived, who objects to the public rooms."</p>
<p>"Sorry," I said firmly, "but I took the rooms for a week, as
you know, and a sitting room is an absolute necessity to us."</p>
<p>The manager glanced at his companion. The latter came a little
forward. He was a fair, quiet-looking man, clean-shaven, moody,
with light-coloured hair brushed back from his forehead. He was
at first glance almost prepossessing. He had the nervous mouth
and quick smile of an artist. It was only his rather
light-coloured eyes which left one a little doubtful about
him.</p>
<p>"It is on my behalf that the manager is speaking," he said. "I
have the good or evil fortune to bear a name which in an
industrial neighbourhood like this is somewhat too well known. I
am Paul Creslin."</p>
<p>Somehow or other I had already surmised the fact, and I was
able to control my coun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254"
id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>tenance. Rose had dropped her
newspaper and was studying the newcomer with interest. He seemed
to observe her for the first time, and a look crept into his eyes
which stamped him at once in my mind. There is a certain type of
profligacy which is self-revealing. I felt myself in a quandary.
My hatred of the man was already born and the words of dismissal
were quivering upon my lips. Then I remembered my mission. I
remembered Thomson's words--"Success is born of the brain and
wrecked by impulse." I choked back the impulse.</p>
<p>"I am not a politician," I said, "but your name is of course
known to me. I cannot offer you our sitting room, for the simple
reason that there is no other place in the hotel for the young
lady, but any time you would care to take refuge here we should
be very pleased, and if you happen to be a late person, it will
be at your disposal after twelve o'clock."</p>
<p>The manager glanced anxiously at his guest. Again the latter's
eyes rested for a moment upon Rose, and he seemed satisfied.</p>
<p>"You are most courteous," he acknowl<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg
255]</a></span>edged. "I am going to my room for a few minutes.
Afterwards I shall venture to intrude."</p>
<p>The two men left the room, followed a few minutes later by
Rastall, in hot haste for the telegraph office. Leonard's
expression, as he looked at me, was almost of horror. Rose, too,
seemed troubled.</p>
<p>"What on earth do you mean, Maurice," she exclaimed, "by
asking us even to breathe the same air as that hateful
person?"</p>
<p>I thrust Leonard into a chair by Rose's side and stood on the
shabby little bit of hearth rug, close to them.</p>
<p>"The time has come," I said, addressing myself particularly to
Rose, "for me to pass on to you the chief's instructions."</p>
<h3>* * * * *</h3>
<p>In the days that followed, we seemed to have caught up into
our own apparently uneventful lives something of that spirit of
waiting drama which pervaded the teeming town and the
smoke-stained countryside. The people all seemed to be waiting
for something. We, too, waited, and in the meantime Creslin made
free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg
256]</a></span> use of our sitting room, drove out with us in the
car which I had hired for a week, and never failed to attend our
performances. Our sitting room was almost a bower of roses and
orchids, flowers which arrived in mysterious parcels from London
and which must have cost a small fortune. I ventured to protest
on the grounds of political economy, but Creslin only smiled.</p>
<p>"Every man is allowed one extravagance in life," he said. "You
and your friend, for instance, drink wine and whisky and soda and
smoke cigars. I do neither. My weakness lies elsewhere."</p>
<p>He glanced across at Rose as he spoke, and at the expression
in his eyes, the slow, amorous, calculating expression, I had to
grip the sides of my chair and look down at the carpet towards
some spilt tobacco ash, to hide my fury. Creslin, who had been
strolling uneasily around the room, seated himself on the sofa by
Rose's side.</p>
<p>"You love flowers, Miss Mindel?" he asked softly, following
the direction of her eyes, which were resting upon a bowl of red
roses.</p>
<p>"I adore them," she acknowledged, "for<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
their own sake--and sometimes, too," she went on, meeting his
gaze with a coquetry for which I could never have given her
credit, "sometimes, too, for the sake of those from whom they
come."</p>
<p>He glanced almost imperceptibly towards Leonard and myself,
one of those slow, inimical glances which seemed yet to betray
some evil purpose. Bearing in mind the stories which one had been
told of this man's cold-blooded and indiscriminate cruelty, it
was easy to believe that if a word from him could have wiped us
off the face of the earth at that moment, it would certainly have
been spoken. Making the best of our presence, however, he
continued his conversation in a low tone. Once I saw Rose flinch
and glance up as though in distress. I came across the room,
making a pretence at filling my pipe from a jar which stood upon
a table near them. Creslin looked at me through his half-closed
eyes.</p>
<p>"Miss Mindel does not approve of the coming emancipation of
her sex," he observed. "I suppose the doctrines of the new world
must sound strange at first to those who have<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
counted the hard and fast chastity of the Puritan amongst the
virtues."</p>
<p>"What are the doctrines of the new world?" I enquired.</p>
<p>"They include, at any rate," he replied, in his quiet,
sibilant voice, "a complete reconstruction of the relations
between man and woman."</p>
<p>"That sounds like Bolshevism, pure and simple," Leonard
remarked bluntly.</p>
<p>"The actual principles of Bolshevism," Creslin asserted,
"contain more than a germ of the truth."</p>
<p>"I should be sorry," I declared, "for the man who made a
serious attempt to wipe out the marriage laws of this
country."</p>
<p>He looked at me with a cynical turn of his thin lips.</p>
<p>"There was never a race of people in the world," he
pronounced, "who hugged their chains like the British. In their
hearts they love the lash of authority. Think. For generations
their leaders, their prophets and their preachers have been drawn
from one class only, the class which they are accustomed
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg
259]</a></span> obey. The people have never found their Rienzi in
politics, in literature or in sociology. That is because of the
age-long snobbishness of the Englishman. During the last ten
years, for the first time, the people have kicked over the traces
so far as regards their material prosperity. They are being fed
with doles and pittances but they are moving forward. Soon they
will begin to think. Then, just as they have asserted themselves
in material ways, they will begin to demand an active voice in
the reconstruction of Society."</p>
<p>"What is your substitute for the marriage laws?" Rose asked
him bluntly.</p>
<p>To do him justice, I must say that he spoke with the
conviction of one who enunciates the most obvious truths, truths
which did not even admit of argument.</p>
<p>"Union between man and woman," he explained, "is intended for
the production of children. The only sane restraint which common
sense should place upon this connection is the presence of human
affection. That is the only restraint there should be."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg
260]</a></span>"I see," Leonard murmured. "And what would become
of the children?"</p>
<p>"They are for the State--children of the State," was the
almost wondering reply. "Every household should have its nursery.
For every child born, a State grant should be given."</p>
<p>"Is there any literature," I enquired, "setting out these
altruistic views?"</p>
<p>"There is," Creslin replied, after a moment's pause. "The time
is scarcely ripe, however, for its dissemination. If you would
care to possess a text book, drawn up by myself and embodying the
principles which I desire sooner or later to be accepted by the
whole world, I will present you with one."</p>
<p>Before we went to bed that night, the precious pamphlet was in
our possession.</p>
<p>The presence of Creslin in the country was now universally
admitted by the Press, although his exact whereabouts did not
once appear in print. The day fixed for the Congress of Labour
leaders, to be held at Blackham, drew near. Meanwhile, Creslin
was watched by detectives and press men alike. It<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
occurred to us more than once that he almost expected and
certainly hoped for arrest. I spoke on this matter to
Rastall.</p>
<p>"There is nothing Creslin desires so much," he pointed out,
"as to pose as a martyr over here. Until he begins to preach his
abominable doctrines or disseminate his literature, he is on the
side of the law. The sociology he preaches, apart from its sexual
side, is reasonable and even finely conceived."</p>
<p>"Supposing he were to be arrested?" I asked.</p>
<p>"The police would never get him out of town," Rastall replied.
"There are a million of his followers within a radius of twenty
miles from here. I think we should see a riot that would approach
almost to a revolution. The man is as cunning as a fox. He will
preach his idealistic sociology first. The rest will creep in by
degrees."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Creslin spent the greater part of his spare time in
our sitting room. He scarcely now made a pretence of taking any
particular interest in either Leonard or myself. His whole
attention was directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262"
id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> towards Rose. To do him
justice, he was a man of considerable culture and fine
perceptions on many subjects. There were times when Rose's face
seemed to light up, when she seemed to find a genuine pleasure in
his conversation. There were others when I saw her cold and
wooden, parrying the unspoken pleadings of his meretricious
philosophy with a skill for which I should never have given her
credit. It was evident that Creslin was very much in earnest
indeed. He was continually inviting her to lunch, to motor, to
leave the hotel alone with him, all of which invitations she
contrived to evade. In the end, he even had the effrontery to
appeal to me.</p>
<p>"I gather," he said, one morning, "that Miss Rose Mindel is
nothing to either of you who are her companions."</p>
<p>"She is nothing to us," I replied, "except a very dear sister
who has a claim upon our joint protection."</p>
<p>"I will not conceal from you," he continued, "that I have the
greatest admiration for Miss Mindel--I might even venture to say
affection."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg
263]</a></span>I received the confession in silence. He seemed
much less at his ease than usual.</p>
<p>"I have met with no woman," he went on, "in whose
companionship I could find more joy."</p>
<p>"Then why don't you ask her to marry you?" I demanded.</p>
<p>He looked at me with his narrow eyes almost wide open.</p>
<p>"You are a little ignorant of the way things are moving in the
world," he said quietly. "You are wrapped up, perhaps--in your
art. I am Creslin. To-morrow, if I chose, I could be dictator of
Russia or Germany, Hungary or Austria. It pleases me instead to
be the spokesman of my class in every country of the world. I do
not understand the word 'marriage'."</p>
<p>I had never harder work in controlling my temper, but I knew
that the time had not yet come. I answered him a little
abruptly.</p>
<p>"I am afraid you will find some of us a little insular. Miss
Mindel is of course free to make her own decisions in life, but
it is as well, perhaps, to impress upon you the fact<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
that whilst she is travelling with us we consider ourselves, Mr.
Cotton and I, her guardians. We should resent forcibly any offer
to her which was not in accordance with the established
conventions."</p>
<p>He smiled in maddening fashion.</p>
<p>"You speak like the hero of one of those melodramas in which I
used to revel when I was a youthful student in London. What I
choose to say to Miss Mindel I shall say. It will be a strange
thing to me if she refuses to listen. Be sensible, my young
friend, and remember."</p>
<p>"Remember what?" I demanded.</p>
<p>"Who I am," he answered, with cool and splendid assurance. "I
carry the burden of the new world upon my shoulders. I am the
future dictator of all human Society."</p>
<p>That finished my scruples. I went off with Leonard and
discussed our plans. Creslin, with all the priceless
imperturbability of his sublime conceit, remained in our sitting
room, waiting for Rose.</p>
<p>On the day before the great Conference, Creslin was a busy
man. All the time he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265"
id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> back and forth between the
temporary offices arranged for the reception of the delegates and
the hotel. When we returned to the sitting room after our evening
performance, he was still absent. The three of us held a little
consultation. We were all of one mind.</p>
<p>"On general principles," Rose agreed, "I think that Creslin is
a detestable person, and I should like to see him publicly
disgraced for ever. On the other hand, I don't think," she went
on, with a little grimace, "that I was cut out for a Delilah. So
far, my conscience is clear enough. I have never given him a word
of encouragement, and if he were to insult me he would deserve
any punishment my guardians might choose to inflict. But what
does make me unhappy is the idea that I might have to deceive him
even by my silence if----"</p>
<p>"But listen," Leonard interrupted eagerly, "I heard him
distinctly whispering to you that to-morrow was to be his great
day; all that he needed was inspiration, that he must carry with
him on to the platform memories and hopes--and a lot of slush of
that sort."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg
266]</a></span>Rose nodded.</p>
<p>"Quite right," she assented. "I promised that I would not go
to bed to-night until I had seen him. I am sure he will be here
presently."</p>
<p>"Very well, then," I decided, "he shall have his chance. If he
is just ordinarily offensive, he shall get the hiding he
deserves, as publicly as possible, and the chief must be
satisfied with that. If he attempts anything else--well, we are
prepared."</p>
<p>Leonard was out of the room for a few minutes, and Rose held
out a hand to me a little tremulously.</p>
<p>"Maurice," she said, and there was a look of trouble in her
dear eyes, "I don't like this. I hate that man near me. I hate
the idea that I may have to listen to horrible things from
him."</p>
<p>"And I hate the thought of your doing it," I answered firmly.
"Say the word, Rose, and we'll finish here. The pamphlet's
enough. Any reasonable Englishman would be justified in giving
him a thrashing for that."</p>
<p>She shook her head regretfully.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg
267]</a></span>"The other is better, of course; only swear that
you will not leave me alone for five seconds."</p>
<p>"I can promise that," I told her grimly.</p>
<p>After all, we need not have troubled ourselves with scruples.
Creslin had made his own plans and made them with devilish
cunning. At midnight, as we had seen nothing of him, I sent down
an enquiry and was told that he had come in quite exhausted and
gone at once to his room. To Leonard and me the news sounded
natural enough. Rose's instinct, however, was not to be
denied.</p>
<p>"I know that he meant what he said about to-night," she
assured us uneasily. "Swear that you will be near, Maurice."</p>
<p>We promised, and soon afterwards she retired. Her bedroom
adjoined the sitting room, and after she had passed through the
connecting door we heard the click of the turning key on the
other side. The outside door, opening upon the corridor, was
secured by a bolt. It certainly seemed as though she could have
no cause for fear. Leonard and I, however, took up our vigil
behind a black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id=
"Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> lacquer screen at the farther end
of the room. We heard the slow dying away of the footsteps upon
the pavement below, the lessening scream of the electric cars,
and finally silence. One o'clock struck, and half-past. We had
both of us given up the idea that anything was likely to happen,
when the door of the sitting room was quietly opened, and
Creslin, in his dressing gown and slippers, entered. He stood
listening for a moment, as though to make sure that he had not
been followed. Then he turned on the electric light, drew a key
from his pocket--a new, shining key--rubbed it with a little oil,
and stole across the room towards the door which led into Rose's
apartment. He essayed no knock, no whispered invitation. He
fitted the key noiselessly into the lock, turned it softly and
disappeared. In five seconds we heard the sound of her muffled
cry. In ten we had dragged him out into the sitting room. He lay
on the carpet, looking at us with frightened eyes, and that
expression upon his face which had so often puzzled me now made
clear. The man was a coward.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg
269]</a></span>"What are you going to do?" he whimpered.</p>
<p>"Horsewhip you first," I told him, "and afterwards punish you.
I shouldn't call out, if I were you," I added, as he opened his
lips. "There's the skeleton key still in the door there, and the
hotel is full of journalists. Better make up your mind to go
through with it."</p>
<p>"If you do me an injury," he cried, "the people to-morrow will
tear you limb from limb."</p>
<p>"Get up," I ordered roughly. "We're taking our chance about
that."</p>
<h3>* * * * *</h3>
<p>Mr. Thomson presided over our usual banquet, a few evenings
later, in the dining room of a suite at the Ritz. He was a little
gaunt and pale, but otherwise showed few signs of his
indisposition. By the side of the plate of each one of us was an
envelope, which he begged us not to open until the end of the
festivities.</p>
<p>"You three," he said musingly, "especially you, Lister, have
put your finger upon one of<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> the quaintest
features of the psychology of these days. Reason and argument,
common sense, statesmanlike appeal, may all fail. It is ridicule
alone which kills. You three, my trusted confederates, have
probably prevented a revolution. You have brought to an end in
ridicule and disgust a great social upheaval."</p>
<p>"Helped by the Press," I reminded him.</p>
<p>"Helped by the Press, without a doubt," he assented. "Their
tone was in every respect admirable. The <i>Daily Hour</i>
cartoon of Creslin, the pure-minded idealist, staggering to his
feet from the bench in the Town Hall Square, tarred and
feathered, a disgraced debauchee, with fragments of his pamphlet
sticking in pieces to his body, and another copy of it hung
around his neck, was the most wonderful thing in educational
journalism. All the same, Lister, you had a narrow escape. It was
the women who saved you."</p>
<p>"The women and again the Press," I reminded him. "Just as the
people themselves were hesitating, the morning papers came
out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg
271]</a></span> with a humourous recital of the true story and a
digest of the pamphlet. Creslin could never again present a
heroic picture to any one. The only earthly chance he ever had of
posing successfully as a prophet of the new social law would have
been the possession of a personal character of unblemished
purity."</p>
<p>"At the same time," Mr. Thomson observed, a little gravely, "I
want you to remember this. Creslin has many friends of his own
ilk, friends who knew his real character and who were
indifferent. I think a short sea voyage would be good for you and
Miss Mindel, at any rate. I will speak of that again
presently."</p>
<p>I met Rose's eyes, and with the knowledge that our compact
ended that evening I attempted no more concealment. She looked
for a moment startled--and then I knew.</p>
<p>"As this is our last official reunion," our host continued, "I
am reminded that there are a good many questions which you have
asked me at various times during our association, the answers to
which I have postponed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272"
id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> until this evening. Question me
now as much as you will."</p>
<p>"Let me start," Rose begged. "I asked the first question,
remember. When you arrested Mountjoy, for whom were you acting?
Were you for the police, or just an ordinary informer?"</p>
<p>"For neither," was the calm reply. "I have been for ten years
the head of the Home Secret Service, an institution, I believe,"
he added, "which is never mentioned, and which not one person in
a thousand knows anything about. The Secret Service still
possesses the minute book I found on Mountjoy. If it had come
into the hands of the police, they would have been compelled to
have taken indiscriminate action and the results would have been
disastrous."</p>
<p>"The jewels which you took from Kinlosti?" I asked.</p>
<p>"They were sold, and the amount stands to the credit of the
Secret Service funds."</p>
<p>"What became of the treasure which was found in the Spens
chateau?"</p>
<p>"It was all returned to its various owners.<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
The Baroness sought my aid because she, too, is a member of our
Secret Service."</p>
<p>"And Naida?"</p>
<p>"There was one of our complete successes," Mr. Thomson
replied. "No court could have tried Kansky. There was no possible
way in which he could have been brought to book for his crimes.
The Secret Service undertook to dispose of him and it did."</p>
<p>"And what about the boy Arthur Dompers and his tutor
Duncombe?" Rose asked.</p>
<p>"A little outside our ordinary course of business," Mr.
Thomson admitted. "Some one or other, however, managed to
convince Scotland Yard that Duncombe meant mischief, and I took
the matter up to oblige them."</p>
<p>"What about the Duke and the Lorringham jewels?" Leonard
enquired.</p>
<p>"That affair was passed over to my supervision," our chief
explained, "because the Lorringham jewels are looked upon as a
sort of national asset in the country, and their retention here
is considered advisable for diplomatic reasons."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg
274]</a></span>"Tell us," Rose begged, "exactly the meaning of
the attack upon you in the Landsdowne Passage."</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson made a little grimace.</p>
<p>"It simply means," he admitted, "that the agents of the Black
Peril have a secret service almost equal to our own. They
flattered me so far as to believe that I was the only man likely
to render abortive the great stroke which Creslin intended to
deliver here. Hence their endeavour to anticipate my
activities."</p>
<p>"You seem to have unlimited powers," Leonard said
thoughtfully. "Doesn't it ever occur to you, sir, to make wider
use of them? For instance, every Englishman knows Creslin was a
terrible danger to the country. He stood for revolution,
disorganisation and anarchy. Why didn't you have him secretly put
out of the way?"</p>
<p>"Because the men who share with me the responsibilities of my
position," Mr. Thomson replied, "my lieutenants and coadjutors,
are men of imagination. We try to see a little beyond the actual
circumstances with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275"
id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> we are confronted. It would
have been the easiest matter in the world for us to have wiped
Creslin from the face of the earth, but if we had done so, his
principles would have lived after him. Everything except the
man's corporal frame would have survived. To-day, a certain
amount of the fascination of his doctrines has perished in the
morass of ridicule which has sucked the man under. His doctrines
never had a moment's chance in this country unless they were
preached by a man of personal purity. We did better than slay
Creslin. We made him ridiculous."</p>
<p>"What made you first approach us at Cromer?" Rose asked, with
a touch of feminine curiosity. "What was there about us, I mean,
which made you think we might be useful?"</p>
<p>"The fact, perhaps, that you looked so innocuous," was the
smiling reply. "I have agents in many walks of life, and the one
thing I aim at as much as possible is to select recruits who not
only appear simple-minded and innocent, but who actually are. You
are none of you intriguers by disposition; you are<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
simple English gentlepeople. You have escaped suspicion many
times for this reason and have therefore been able to succeed,
when any ordinary agent would have been suspected from the
first."</p>
<p>"I see," Rose murmured.</p>
<p>"You will gratify me," Mr. Thomson suggested, "if you open
your envelopes."</p>
<p>We obeyed. Then I saw what I had never dreamed of seeing in my
life--not one but five thousand-pound Bank of England notes.</p>
<p>"I have treated you all the same," our benefactor said. "I
hope that you will never regret this year out of your lives. I
have answered all your conundrums. I will now ask you one. What
are you going to do with your money?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," Rose gasped.</p>
<p>"I am going to buy a share in my father's business and go back
to the wine trade," Leonard decided. "Half this money will make a
new man of him."</p>
<p>"I am going to marry Rose," I declared.</p>
<p>"But you haven't asked me!" she protested indignantly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg
277]</a></span>I glanced at Leonard.</p>
<p>"The year's up, I suppose, old fellow," he said, with a sigh.
"We both ask you to marry us, Rose."</p>
<p>"Bolshevists!" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>"I mean we ask you to choose," he corrected.</p>
<p>She gave me her hand. Leonard drank a glass of champagne in
gloomy silence and afterwards shook hands with both of us. Rose
and he exchanged a few earnest sentences. Mr. Thomson spoke a
valedictory word.</p>
<p>"My friends," he said, "to-night we part. I have helped, I
hope, to bring colour into your lives. I ask but one thing of you
in return, and that is--silence for twelve months."</p>
<p>We promised, and we kept our word.</p>
