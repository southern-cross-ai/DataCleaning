  <h3>Written in 1908<br>
  Published in <i>The United Amateur</i>, November 1916<br>
  Reprinted in <i>The Tomb And Other Tales</i>, 1970</h3>

  <p>High up, crowning the grassy summit of a swelling mount whose sides are
  wooded near the base with the gnarled trees of the primeval forest stands the
  old chateau of my ancestors. For centuries its lofty battlements have frowned
  down upon the wild and rugged countryside about, serving as a home and
  stronghold for the proud house whose honored line is older even than the
  moss-grown castle walls. These ancient turrets, stained by the storms of
  generations and crumbling under the slow yet mighty pressure of time, formed
  in the ages of feudalism one of the most dreaded and formidable fortresses in
  all France. From its machicolated parapets and mounted battlements Barons,
  Counts, and even Kings had been defied, yet never had its spacious halls
  resounded to the footsteps of the invader.</p>

  <p>But since those glorious years, all is changed. A poverty but little above
  the level of dire want, together with a pride of name that forbids its
  alleviation by the pursuits of commercial life, have prevented the scions of
  our line from maintaining their estates in pristine splendor; and the falling
  stones of the walls, the overgrown vegetation in the parks, the dry and dusty
  moat, the ill-paved courtyards, and toppling towers without, as well as the
  sagging floors, the worm-eaten wainscots, and the faded tapestries within,
  all tell a gloomy tale of fallen grandeur. As the ages passed, first one,
  then another of the four great turrets were left to ruin, until at last but a
  single tower housed the sadly reduced descendants of the once mighty lords of
  the estate.</p>

  <p>It was in one of the vast and gloomy chambers of this remaining tower that
  I, Antoine, last of the unhappy and accursed Counts de C&mdash;, first saw
  the light of day, ninety long years ago. Within these walls and amongst the
  dark and shadowy forests, the wild ravines and grottos of the hillside below,
  were spent the first years of my troubled life. My parents I never knew. My
  father had been killed at the age of thirty-two, a month before I was born,
  by the fall of a stone somehow dislodged from one of the deserted parapets of
  the castle. And my mother having died at my birth, my care and education
  devolved solely upon one remaining servitor, an old and trusted man of
  considerable intelligence, whose name I remember as Pierre. I was an only
  child and the lack of companionship which this fact entailed upon me was
  augmented by the strange care exercised by my aged guardian, in excluding me
  from the society of the peasant children whose abodes were scattered here and
  there upon the plains that surround the base of the hill. At that time,
  Pierre said that this restriction was imposed upon me because my noble birth
  placed me above association with such plebeian company. Now I know that its
  real object was to keep from my ears the idle tales of the dread curse upon
  our line that were nightly told and magnified by the simple tenantry as they
  conversed in hushed accents in the glow of their cottage hearths.</p>

  <p>Thus isolated, and thrown upon my own resources, I spent the hours of my
  childhood in poring over the ancient tomes that filled the shadow haunted
  library of the chateau, and in roaming without aim or purpose through the
  perpetual dust of the spectral wood that clothes the side of the hill near
  its foot. It was perhaps an effect of such surroundings that my mind early
  acquired a shade of melancholy. Those studies and pursuits which partake of
  the dark and occult in nature most strongly claimed my attention.</p>

  <p>Of my own race I was permitted to learn singularly little, yet what small
  knowledge of it I was able to gain seemed to depress me much. Perhaps it was
  at first only the manifest reluctance of my old preceptor to discuss with me
  my paternal ancestry that gave rise to the terror which I ever felt at the
  mention of my great house, yet as I grew out of childhood, I was able to
  piece together disconnected fragments of discourse, let slip from the
  unwilling tongue which had begun to falter in approaching senility, that had
  a sort of relation to a certain circumstance which I had always deemed
  strange, but which now became dimly terrible. The circumstance to which I
  allude is the early age at which all the Counts of my line had met their end.
  Whilst I had hitherto considered this but a natural attribute of a family of
  short-lived men, I afterward pondered long upon these premature deaths, and
  began to connect them with the wanderings of the old man, who often spoke of
  a curse which for centuries had prevented the lives of the holders of my
  title from much exceeding the span of thirty-two years. Upon my twenty-first
  birthday, the aged Pierre gave to me a family document which he said had for
  many generations been handed down from father to son, and continued by each
  possessor. Its contents were of the most startling nature, and its perusal
  confirmed the gravest of my apprehensions. At this time, my belief in the
  supernatural was firm and deep-seated, else I should have dismissed with
  scorn the incredible narrative unfolded before my eyes.</p>

  <p>The paper carried me back to the days of the thirteenth century, when the
  old castle in which I sat had been a feared and impregnable fortress. It told
  of a certain ancient man who had once dwelled on our estates, a person of no
  small accomplishments, though little above the rank of peasant, by name,
  Michel, usually designated by the surname of Mauvais, the Evil, on account of
  his sinister reputation. He had studied beyond the custom of his kind,
  seeking such things as the Philosopher's Stone or the Elixir of Eternal Life,
  and was reputed wise in the terrible secrets of Black Magic and Alchemy.
  Michel Mauvais had one son, named Charles, a youth as proficient as himself
  in the hidden arts, who had therefore been called Le Sorcier, or the Wizard.
  This pair, shunned by all honest folk, were suspected of the most hideous
  practices. Old Michel was said to have burnt his wife alive as a sacrifice to
  the Devil, and the unaccountable disappearance of many small peasant children
  was laid at the dreaded door of these two. Yet through the dark natures of
  the father and son ran one redeeming ray of humanity; the evil old man loved
  his offspring with fierce intensity, whilst the youth had for his parent a
  more than filial affection.</p>

  <p>One night the castle on the hill was thrown into the wildest confusion by
  the vanishment of young Godfrey, son to Henri, the Count. A searching party,
  headed by the frantic father, invaded the cottage of the sorcerers and there
  came upon old Michel Mauvais, busy over a huge and violently boiling
  cauldron. Without certain cause, in the ungoverned madness of fury and
  despair, the Count laid hands on the aged wizard, and ere he released his
  murderous hold, his victim was no more. Meanwhile, joyful servants were
  proclaiming the finding of young Godfrey in a distant and unused chamber of
  the great edifice, telling too late that poor Michel had been killed in vain.
  As the Count and his associates turned away from the lowly abode of the
  alchemist, the form of Charles Le Sorcier appeared through the trees. The
  excited chatter of the menials standing about told him what had occurred, yet
  he seemed at first unmoved at his father's fate. Then, slowly advancing to
  meet the Count, he pronounced in dull yet terrible accents the curse that
  ever afterward haunted the house of C&mdash;.</p>

  <p class="poem">'May ne'er a noble of thy murd'rous line<br>
  Survive to reach a greater age than thine!'</p>

  <p>spake he, when, suddenly leaping backwards into the black woods, he drew
  from his tunic a phial of colorless liquid which he threw into the face of
  his father's slayer as he disappeared behind the inky curtain of the night.
  The Count died without utterance, and was buried the next day, but little
  more than two and thirty years from the hour of his birth. No trace of the
  assassin could be found, though relentless bands of peasants scoured the
  neighboring woods and the meadowland around the hill.</p>

  <p>Thus time and the want of a reminder dulled the memory of the curse in the
  minds of the late Count's family, so that when Godfrey, innocent cause of the
  whole tragedy and now bearing the title, was killed by an arrow whilst
  hunting at the age of thirty-two, there were no thoughts save those of grief
  at his demise. But when, years afterward, the next young Count, Robert by
  name, was found dead in a nearby field of no apparent cause, the peasants
  told in whispers that their seigneur had but lately passed his thirty-second
  birthday when surprised by early death. Louis, son to Robert, was found
  drowned in the moat at the same fateful age, and thus down through the
  centuries ran the ominous chronicle: Henris, Roberts, Antoines, and Armands
  snatched from happy and virtuous lives when little below the age of their
  unfortunate ancestor at his murder.</p>

  <p>That I had left at most but eleven years of further existence was made
  certain to me by the words which I had read. My life, previously held at
  small value, now became dearer to me each day, as I delved deeper and deeper
  into the mysteries of the hidden world of black magic. Isolated as I was,
  modern science had produced no impression upon me, and I labored as in the
  Middle Ages, as wrapt as had been old Michel and young Charles themselves in
  the acquisition of demonological and alchemical learning. Yet read as I
  might, in no manner could I account for the strange curse upon my line. In
  unusually rational moments I would even go so far as to seek a natural
  explanation, attributing the early deaths of my ancestors to the sinister
  Charles Le Sorcier and his heirs; yet, having found upon careful inquiry that
  there were no known descendants of the alchemist, I would fall back to occult
  studies, and once more endeavor to find a spell, that would release my house
  from its terrible burden. Upon one thing I was absolutely resolved. I should
  never wed, for, since no other branch of my family was in existence, I might
  thus end the curse with myself.</p>

  <p>As I drew near the age of thirty, old Pierre was called to the land
  beyond. Alone I buried him beneath the stones of the courtyard about which he
  had loved to wander in life. Thus was I left to ponder on myself as the only
  human creature within the great fortress, and in my utter solitude my mind
  began to cease its vain protest against the impending doom, to become almost
  reconciled to the fate which so many of my ancestors had met. Much of my time
  was now occupied in the exploration of the ruined and abandoned halls and
  towers of the old chateau, which in youth fear had caused me to shun, and
  some of which old Pierre had once told me had not been trodden by human foot
  for over four centuries. Strange and awesome were many of the objects I
  encountered. Furniture, covered by the dust of ages and crumbling with the
  rot of long dampness, met my eyes. Cobwebs in a profusion never before seen
  by me were spun everywhere, and huge bats flapped their bony and uncanny
  wings on all sides of the otherwise untenanted gloom.</p>

  <p>Of my exact age, even down to days and hours, I kept a most careful
  record, for each movement of the pendulum of the massive clock in the library
  told off so much of my doomed existence. At length I approached that time
  which I had so long viewed with apprehension. Since most of my ancestors had
  been seized some little while before they reached the exact age of Count
  Henri at his end, I was every moment on the watch for the coming of the
  unknown death. In what strange form the curse should overtake me, I knew not;
  but I was resolved at least that it should not find me a cowardly or a
  passive victim. With new vigor I applied myself to my examination of the old
  chateau and its contents.</p>

  <p>It was upon one of the longest of all my excursions of discovery in the
  deserted portion of the castle, less than a week before that fatal hour which
  I felt must mark the utmost limit of my stay on earth, beyond which I could
  have not even the slightest hope of continuing to draw breath that I came
  upon the culminating event of my whole life. I had spent the better part of
  the morning in climbing up and down half ruined staircases in one of the most
  dilapidated of the ancient turrets. As the afternoon progressed, I sought the
  lower levels, descending into what appeared to be either a mediaeval place of
  confinement, or a more recently excavated storehouse for gunpowder. As I
  slowly traversed the niter-encrusted passageway at the foot of the last
  staircase, the paving became very damp, and soon I saw by the light of my
  flickering torch that a blank, water-stained wall impeded my journey. Turning
  to retrace my steps, my eye fell upon a small trapdoor with a ring, which lay
  directly beneath my foot. Pausing, I succeeded with difficulty in raising it,
  whereupon there was revealed a black aperture, exhaling noxious fumes which
  caused my torch to sputter, and disclosing in the unsteady glare the top of a
  flight of stone steps.</p>

  <p>As soon as the torch which I lowered into the repellent depths burned
  freely and steadily, I commenced my descent. The steps were many, and led to
  a narrow stone-flagged passage which I knew must be far underground. This
  passage proved of great length, and terminated in a massive oaken door,
  dripping with the moisture of the place, and stoutly resisting all my
  attempts to open it. Ceasing after a time my efforts in this direction, I had
  proceeded back some distance toward the steps when there suddenly fell to my
  experience one of the most profound and maddening shocks capable of reception
  by the human mind. Without warning, I heard the heavy door behind me creak
  slowly open upon its rusted hinges. My immediate sensations were incapable of
  analysis. To be confronted in a place as thoroughly deserted as I had deemed
  the old castle with evidence of the presence of man or spirit produced in my
  brain a horror of the most acute description. When at last I turned and faced
  the seat of the sound, my eyes must have started from their orbits at the
  sight that they beheld.</p>

  <p>There in the ancient Gothic doorway stood a human figure. It was that of a
  man clad in a skull-cap and long mediaeval tunic of dark color. His long hair
  and flowing beard were of a terrible and intense black hue, and of incredible
  profusion. His forehead, high beyond the usual dimensions; his cheeks, deep-
  sunken and heavily lined with wrinkles; and his hands, long, claw-like, and
  gnarled, were of such a deadly marble-like whiteness as I have never
  elsewhere seen in man. His figure, lean to the proportions of a skeleton, was
  strangely bent and almost lost within the voluminous folds of his peculiar
  garment. But strangest of all were his eyes, twin caves of abysmal blackness,
  profound in expression of understanding, yet inhuman in degree of wickedness.
  These were now fixed upon me, piercing my soul with their hatred, and rooting
  me to the spot whereon I stood.</p>

  <p>At last the figure spoke in a rumbling voice that chilled me through with
  its dull hollowness and latent malevolence. The language in which the
  discourse was clothed was that debased form of Latin in use amongst the more
  learned men of the Middle Ages, and made familiar to me by my prolonged
  researches into the works of the old alchemists and demonologists. The
  apparition spoke of the curse which had hovered over my house, told me of my
  coming end, dwelt on the wrong perpetrated by my ancestor against old Michel
  Mauvais, and gloated over the revenge of Charles Le Sorcier. He told how
  young Charles has escaped into the night, returning in after years to kill
  Godfrey the heir with an arrow just as he approached the age which had been
  his father's at his assassination; how he had secretly returned to the estate
  and established himself, unknown, in the even then deserted subterranean
  chamber whose doorway now framed the hideous narrator, how he had seized
  Robert, son of Godfrey, in a field, forced poison down his throat, and left
  him to die at the age of thirty-two, thus maintaining the foul provisions of
  his vengeful curse. At this point I was left to imagine the solution of the
  greatest mystery of all, how the curse had been fulfilled since that time
  when Charles Le Sorcier must in the course of nature have died, for the man
  digressed into an account of the deep alchemical studies of the two wizards,
  father and son, speaking most particularly of the researches of Charles Le
  Sorcier concerning the elixir which should grant to him who partook of it
  eternal life and youth.</p>

  <p>His enthusiasm had seemed for the moment to remove from his terrible eyes
  the black malevolence that had first so haunted me, but suddenly the fiendish
  glare returned and, with a shocking sound like the hissing of a serpent, the
  stranger raised a glass phial with the evident intent of ending my life as
  had Charles Le Sorcier, six hundred years before, ended that of my ancestor.
  Prompted by some preserving instinct of self-defense, I broke through the
  spell that had hitherto held me immovable, and flung my now dying torch at
  the creature who menaced my existence. I heard the phial break harmlessly
  against the stones of the passage as the tunic of the strange man caught fire
  and lit the horrid scene with a ghastly radiance. The shriek of fright and
  impotent malice emitted by the would-be assassin proved too much for my
  already shaken nerves, and I fell prone upon the slimy floor in a total
  faint.</p>

  <p>When at last my senses returned, all was frightfully dark, and my mind,
  remembering what had occurred, shrank from the idea of beholding any more;
  yet curiosity over-mastered all. Who, I asked myself, was this man of evil,
  and how came he within the castle walls? Why should he seek to avenge the
  death of Michel Mauvais, and how bad the curse been carried on through all
  the long centuries since the time of Charles Le Sorcier? The dread of years
  was lifted from my shoulder, for I knew that he whom I had felled was the
  source of all my danger from the curse; and now that I was free, I burned
  with the desire to learn more of the sinister thing which had haunted my line
  for centuries, and made of my own youth one long-continued nightmare.
  Determined upon further exploration, I felt in my pockets for flint and
  steel, and lit the unused torch which I had with me.</p>

  <p>First of all, new light revealed the distorted and blackened form of the
  mysterious stranger. The hideous eyes were now closed. Disliking the sight, I
  turned away and entered the chamber beyond the Gothic door. Here I found what
  seemed much like an alchemist's laboratory. In one corner was an immense pile
  of shining yellow metal that sparkled gorgeously in the light of the torch.
  It may have been gold, but I did not pause to examine it, for I was strangely
  affected by that which I had undergone. At the farther end of the apartment
  was an opening leading out into one of the many wild ravines of the dark
  hillside forest. Filled with wonder, yet now realizing how the man had
  obtained access to the chateau, I proceeded to return. I had intended to pass
  by the remains of the stranger with averted face but, as I approached the
  body, I seemed to hear emanating from it a faint sound, as though life were
  not yet wholly extinct. Aghast, I turned to examine the charred and
  shrivelled figure on the floor.</p>

  <p>Then all at once the horrible eyes, blacker even than the seared face in
  which they were set, opened wide with an expression which I was unable to
  interpret. The cracked lips tried to frame words which I could not well
  understand. Once I caught the name of Charles Le Sorcier, and again I fancied
  that the words 'years' and 'curse' issued from the twisted mouth. Still I was
  at a loss to gather the purport of his disconnnected speech. At my evident
  ignorance of his meaning, the pitchy eyes once more flashed malevolently at
  me, until, helpless as I saw my opponent to be, I trembled as I watched
  him.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the wretch, animated with his last burst of strength, raised his
  piteous head from the damp and sunken pavement. Then, as I remained,
  paralyzed with fear, he found his voice and in his dying breath screamed
  forth those words which have ever afterward haunted my days and nights.
  'Fool!' he shrieked, 'Can you not guess my secret? Have you no brain whereby
  you may recognize the will which has through six long centuries fulfilled the
  dreadful curse upon the house? Have I not told you of the great elixir of
  eternal life? Know you not how the secret of Alchemy was solved? I tell you,
  it is I! I! I! that have lived for six hundred years to maintain my revenge,
  for I am Charles Le Sorcier!'</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">2.&mdash;THE BEAST IN THE CAVE</a></h2>

  <h3>Written April 21, 1905<br>
  Published in <i>The Vagrant</i>, No. 7, June 1918<br>
  Reprinted in <i>The Acolyte</i>, Fall 1943</h3>

  <p>The horrible conclusion which had been gradually intruding itself upon my
  confused and reluctant mind was now an awful certainty. I was lost,
  completely, hopelessly lost in the vast and labyrinthine recess of the
  Mammoth Cave. Turn as I might, in no direction could my straining vision
  seize on any object capable of serving as a guidepost to set me on the
  outward path. That nevermore should I behold the blessed light of day, or
  scan the pleasant bills and dales of the beautiful world outside, my reason
  could no longer entertain the slightest unbelief. Hope had departed. Yet,
  indoctrinated as I was by a life of philosophical study, I derived no small
  measure of satisfaction from my unimpassioned demeanor; for although I had
  frequently read of the wild frenzies into which were thrown the victims of
  similar situations, I experienced none of these, but stood quiet as soon as I
  clearly realized the loss of my bearings.</p>

  <p>Nor did the thought that I had probably wandered beyond the utmost limits
  of an ordinary search cause me to abandon my composure even for a moment. If
  I must die, I reflected, then was this terrible yet majestic cavern as
  welcome a sepulcher as that which any churchyard might afford, a conception
  which carried with it more of tranquillity than of despair.</p>

  <p>Starving would prove my ultimate fate; of this I was certain. Some, I
  knew, had gone mad under circumstances such as these, but I felt that this
  end would not be mine. My disaster was the result of no fault save my own,
  since unknown to the guide I had separated myself from the regular party of
  sightseers; and, wandering for over an hour in forbidden avenues of the cave,
  had found myself unable to retrace the devious windings which I had pursued
  since forsaking my companions.</p>

  <p>Already my torch had begun to expire; soon I would be enveloped by the
  total and almost palpable blackness of the bowels of the earth. As I stood in
  the waning, unsteady light, I idly wondered over the exact circumstances of
  my coming end. I remembered the accounts which I had heard of the colony of
  consumptives, who, taking their residence in this gigantic grotto to find
  health from the apparently salubrious air of the underground world, with its
  steady, uniform temperature, pure air, and peaceful quiet, had found,
  instead, death in strange and ghastly form. I had seen the sad remains of
  their ill-made cottages as I passed them by with the party, and had wondered
  what unnatural influence a long sojourn in this immense and silent cavern
  would exert upon one as healthy and vigorous as I. Now, I grimly told myself,
  my opportunity for settling this point had arrived, provided that want of
  food should not bring me too speedy a departure from this life.</p>

  <p>As the last fitful rays of my torch faded into obscurity, I resolved to
  leave no stone unturned, no possible means of escape neglected; so, summoning
  all the powers possessed by my lungs, I set up a series of loud shoutings, in
  the vain hope of attracting the attention of the guide by my clamor. Yet, as
  I called, I believed in my heart that my cries were to no purpose, and that
  my voice, magnified and reflected by the numberless ramparts of the black
  maze about me, fell upon no ears save my own.</p>

  <p>All at once, however, my attention was fixed with a start as I fancied
  that I heard the sound of soft approaching steps on the rocky floor of the
  cavern.</p>

  <p>Was my deliverance about to be accomplished so soon? Had, then, all my
  horrible apprehensions been for naught, and was the guide, having marked my
  unwarranted absence from the party, following my course and seeking me out in
  this limestone labyrinth? Whilst these joyful queries arose in my brain, I
  was on the point of renewing my cries, in order that my discovery might come
  the sooner, when in an instant my delight was turned to horror as I listened;
  for my ever acute ear, now sharpened in even greater degree by the complete
  silence of the cave, bore to my benumbed understanding the unexpected and
  dreadful knowledge that these footfalls were <i>not like those of any mortal
  man.</i> In the unearthly stillness of this subterranean region, the tread of
  the booted guide would have sounded like a series of sharp and incisive
  blows. These impacts were soft, and stealthy, as of the paws of some feline.
  Besides, when I listened carefully, I seemed to trace the falls of
  <i>four</i> instead of <i>two</i> feet.</p>

  <p>I was now convinced that I had by my own cries aroused and attracted some
  wild beast, perhaps a mountain lion which had accidentally strayed within the
  cave. Perhaps, I considered, the Almighty had chosen for me a swifter and
  more merciful death than that of hunger; yet the instinct of
  self-preservation, never wholly dormant, was stirred in my breast, and though
  escape from the on-coming peril might but spare me for a sterner and more
  lingering end, I determined nevertheless to part with my life at as high a
  price as I could command. Strange as it may seem, my mind conceived of no
  intent on the part of the visitor save that of hostility. Accordingly, I
  became very quiet, in the hope that the unknown beast would, in the absence
  of a guiding sound, lose its direction as had I, and thus pass me by. But
  this hope was not destined for realization, for the strange footfalls
  steadily advanced, the animal evidently having obtained my scent, which in an
  atmosphere so absolutely free from all distracting influences as is that of
  the cave, could doubtless be followed at great distance.</p>

  <p>Seeing therefore that I must be armed for defense against an uncanny and
  unseen attack in the dark, I groped about me the largest of the fragments of
  rock which were strewn upon all parts of the floor of the cavern in the
  vicinity, and grasping one in each hand for immediate use, awaited with
  resignation the inevitable result. Meanwhile the hideous pattering of the
  paws drew near. Certainly, the conduct of the creature was exceedingly
  strange. Most of the time, the tread seemed to be that of a quadruped,
  walking with a singular <i>lack of unison</i> betwixt hind and fore feet, yet
  at brief and infrequent intervals I fancied that but two feet were engaged in
  the process of locomotion. I wondered what species of animal was to confront
  me; it must, I thought, be some unfortunate beast who had paid for its
  curiosity to investigate one of the entrances of the fearful grotto with a
  life-long confinement in its interminable recesses. It doubtless obtained as
  food the eyeless fish, bats and rats of the cave, as well as some of the
  ordinary fish that are wafted in at every freshet of Green River, which
  communicates in some occult manner with the waters of the cave. I occupied my
  terrible vigil with grotesque conjectures of what alteration cave life might
  have wrought in the physical structure of the beast, remembering the awful
  appearances ascribed by local tradition to the consumptives who had died
  after long residence in the cave. Then I remembered with a start that, even
  should I succeed in felling my antagonist, I should <i>never behold its
  form</i>, as my torch had long since been extinct, and I was entirely
  unprovided with matches. The tension on my brain now became frightful. My
  disordered fancy conjured up hideous and fearsome shapes from the sinister
  darkness that surrounded me, and that actually seemed to press upon my body.
  Nearer, nearer, the dreadful footfalls approached. It seemed that I must give
  vent to a piercing scream, yet had I been sufficiently irresolute to attempt
  such a thing, my voice could scarce have responded. I was petrified, rooted
  to the spot. I doubted if my right arm would allow me to hurl its missile at
  the oncoming thing when the crucial moment should arrive. Now the steady
  <i>pat, pat,</i> of the steps was close at hand; now <i>very</i> close. I
  could hear the labored breathing of the animal, and terror-struck as I was, I
  realized that it must have come from a considerable distance, and was
  correspondingly fatigued. Suddenly the spell broke. My right hand, guided by
  my ever trustworthy sense of hearing, threw with full force the sharp-angled
  bit of limestone which it contained, toward that point in the darkness from
  which emanated the breathing and pattering, and, wonderful to relate, it
  nearly reached its goal, for I heard the thing jump, landing at a distance
  away, where it seemed to pause.</p>

  <p>Having readjusted my aim, I discharged my second missile, this time most
  effectively, for with a flood of joy I listened as the creature fell in what
  sounded like a complete collapse and evidently remained prone and unmoving.
  Almost overpowered by the great relief which rushed over me, I reeled back
  against the wall. The breathing continued, in heavy, gasping inhalations and
  expirations, whence I realized that I had no more than wounded the creature.
  And now all desire to examine the <i>thing</i> ceased. At last something
  allied to groundless, superstitious fear had entered my brain, and I did not
  approach the body, nor did I continue to cast stones at it in order to
  complete the extinction of its life. Instead, I ran at full speed in what
  was, as nearly as I could estimate in my frenzied condition, the direction
  from which I had come. Suddenly I heard a sound or rather, a regular
  succession of sounds. In another Instant they had resolved themselves into a
  series of sharp, metallic clicks. This time there was no doubt. <i>It was the
  guide.</i> And then I shouted, yelled, screamed, even shrieked with joy as I
  beheld in the vaulted arches above the faint and glimmering effulgence which
  I knew to be the reflected light of an approaching torch. I ran to meet the
  flare, and before I could completely understand what had occurred, was lying
  upon the ground at the feet of the guide, embracing his boots and gibbering.
  despite my boasted reserve, in a most meaningless and idiotic manner, pouring
  out my terrible story, and at the same time overwhelming my auditor with
  protestations of gratitude. At length, I awoke to something like my normal
  consciousness. The guide had noted my absence upon the arrival of the party
  at the entrance of the cave, and had, from his own intuitive sense of
  direction, proceeded to make a thorough canvass of by-passages just ahead of
  where he had last spoken to me, locating my whereabouts after a quest of
  about four hours.</p>

  <p>By the time he had related this to me, I, emboldened by his torch and his
  company, began to reflect upon the strange beast which I had wounded but a
  short distance back in the darkness, and suggested that we ascertain, by the
  flashlight's aid, what manner of creature was my victim. Accordingly I
  retraced my steps, this time with a courage born of companionship, to the
  scene of my terrible experience. Soon we descried a white object upon the
  floor, an object whiter even than the gleaming limestone itself. Cautiously
  advancing, we gave vent to a simultaneous ejaculation of wonderment, for of
  all the unnatural monsters either of us had in our lifetimes beheld, this was
  in surpassing degree the strangest. It appeared to be an anthropoid ape of
  large proportions, escaped, perhaps, from some itinerant menagerie. Its hair
  was snow-white, a thing due no doubt to the bleaching action of a long
  existence within the inky confines of the cave, but it was also surprisingly
  thin, being indeed largely absent save on the head, where it was of such
  length and abundance that it fell over the shoulders in considerable
  profusion. The face was turned away from us, as the creature lay almost
  directly upon it. The inclination of the limbs was very singular, explaining,
  however, the alternation in their use which I bad before noted, whereby the
  beast used sometimes all four, and on other occasions but two for its
  progress. From the tips of the fingers or toes, long rat-like claws extended.
  The hands or feet were not prehensile, a fact that I ascribed to that long
  residence in the cave which, as I before mentioned, seemed evident from the
  all-pervading and almost unearthly whiteness so characteristic of the whole
  anatomy. No tail seemed to be present.</p>

  <p>The respiration had now grown very feeble, and the guide had drawn his
  pistol with the evident intent of despatching the creature, when a sudden
  <i>sound</i> emitted by the latter caused the weapon to fall unused. The
  sound was of a nature difficult to describe. It was not like the normal note
  of any known species of simian, and I wonder if this unnatural quality were
  not the result of a long continued and complete silence, broken by the
  sensations produced by the advent of the light, a thing which the beast could
  not have seen since its first entrance into the cave. The sound, which I
  might feebly attempt to classify as a kind of deep-tone chattering, was
  faintly continued.</p>

  <p>All at once a fleeting spasm of energy seemed to pass through the frame of
  the beast. The paws went through a convulsive motion, and the limbs
  contracted. With a jerk, the white body rolled over so that its face was
  turned in our direction. For a moment I was so struck with horror at the eyes
  thus revealed that I noted nothing else. They were black, those eyes, deep
  jetty black, in hideous contrast to the snow-white hair and flesh. Like those
  of other cave denizens, they were deeply sunken in their orbits, and were
  entirely destitute of iris. As I looked more closely, I saw that they were
  set in a face less prognathous than that of the average ape, and infinitely
  less hairy. The nose was quite distinct. As we gazed upon the uncanny sight
  presented to our vision, the thick lips opened, and several <i>sounds</i>
  issued from them, after which the <i>thing</i> relaxed in death.</p>

  <p>The guide clutched my coat sleeve and trembled so violently that the light
  shook fitfully, casting weird moving shadows on the walls.</p>

  <p>I made no motion, but stood rigidly still, my horrified eyes fixed upon
  the floor ahead.</p>

  <p>The fear left, and wonder, awe, compassion, and reverence succeeded in its
  place, for the <i>sounds</i> uttered by the stricken figure that lay
  stretched out on the limestone had told us the awesome truth. The creature I
  had killed, the strange beast of the unfathomed cave, was, or had at one time
  been a MAN!!!</p>

  <h3>SHORT VERSION</h3>

  <h3>The Royal Press, 1902</h3>

  <h3>CHAPTER 1.</h3>

  <p>In the spring of 1847, the little village of Ruralville was thrown into a
  state of exitement by the arrival of a strange brig in the harbour. It
  carried no flag, and everything about it was such as would exite suspicion.
  It had no name. Its captain was named Manuel Ruello. The exitement increased
  however when John Griggs dissapeared from his home. This was Oct. 4. On Oct.
  5 the brig was gone.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER 2.</h3>

  <p>The brig, in leaving, was met by a U.S. frigate and a sharp fight ensued.
  When over, they* missed a man named Henry Johns.</p>

  <p class="footnote">*(The Frigate.)</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER 3.</h3>

  <p>The brig continued its course in the direction of Madagascar. Upon its
  arrival the natives fled in all directions. When they came together on the
  other side of the island, one was missing. His name was Dahabea.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER 4.</h3>

  <p>At length it was decided that something must be done. A reward of &pound;5,000
  was offered for the capture of Manuel Ruello. Then startling news came: a
  nameless brig was wrecked on the Florida Keys.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER 5.</h3>

  <p>A ship was sent to Florida, and the mystery was solved. In the excitement
  of the fight they would launch a submarine boat and take what they wanted.
  There it lay, tranquilly rocking on the waters of the Atlantic when someone
  called out "John Brown has dissapeared." And sure enough John Brown was
  gone.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER 6.</h3>

  <p>The finding of the submarine boat, and the dissapearance of John Brown,
  caused renewed exitement amongst the people, when a new discovery was made.
  In transcribing this discovery it is necessary to relate a geographical fact.
  At the North Pole there exists a vast continent composed of volcanic soil, a
  portion of which is open to explorers. It is called "No-Mans Land."</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER 7.</h3>

  <p>In the extreme southern part of No-Mans Land, there was found a hut, and
  several other signs of human habitation. They promptly entered, and, chained
  to the floor, lay Griggs, Johns, and Dahabea. They, upon arriving in London,
  separated, Griggs going to Ruralville, Johns to the frigate, and Dahabea to
  Madagascar.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER 8.</h3>

  <p>But the mystery of John Brown was still unsolved, so they kept strict
  watch over the port at No-Mans Land, and when the submarine boat arrived, and
  the pirates, one by one, and headed by Manuel Ruello, left the ship, they
  were met by a rapid fire. After the fight Brown was recovered.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER 9.</h3>

  <p>Griggs was royally received at Ruralville, and a dinner was given in
  honour of Henry Johns, Dahabea was made King of Madagascar, and Brown was
  made Captain of his ship.</p>

  <h3>LONG VERSION</h3>

  <h3>By Anonymus</h3>

  <p>In the Spring of 1847, the little village of Ruralville was thrown into a
  state of excitement by the landing of a strange brig in the harbour. It
  carried no flag, and no name was painted on its side, and everything about it
  was such as would excite suspicion. It was from Tripoli, Africa, and the
  captain was named Manuel Ruello. The excitement increased, however; when John
  Griggs (the magnate of the villiage) suddenly disappeared from his home. This
  was the night of October 4th&mdash;On October 5th the brig left.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

  <p>It was 8 bells on the U.S. frigate <i>Constitution</i> when Commander
  Farragut sighted a strange brig to the westward. It carried no flag, and no
  name was painted on its side, and everything about it was such as would
  excite suspicion. On hailing, it put up the Pirates Flag. Farragut ordered a
  gun fired and no sooner did he fire, than the pirate ship gave them a
  broadside. When the fight was over Commander Farragut missed one man named
  Henry F. Johns.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

  <p>It was summer on the Island of Madagascar. And natives were picking corn,
  when one cried "Companions! I sight a ship! with no flag and with no name
  printed on the side and with everything about it such as would excite
  suspicion!" And the natives fled in all directions. When they came together
  on the other side of the island one was missing. His name was Dahabea.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

  <p>At length it was decided something must be done. Notes were compared.
  Three abductions were found to have taken place. [The] dissapearance of John
  Griggs, Henry John, and Dahabea, were recalled. Finally advertisements were
  issued offering &pound;5000 reward for the capture of Manuel Ruello, ship,
  prisoners, and crew. Then exciting news reached London! An unknown brig with
  no name was wrecked off The Florida Keys in America!</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

  <p>The people hurried to Florida and behold&mdash; A steel spindle-shaped
  object lay placidly on the water beside the shattered wreck of the brig. "A
  submarine boat!" shouted one "Yes!" shouted another. "The mystery is
  cleared," said a wise-looking man. "In the excitement of the fight they
  launch the submarine boat and take as many as they wish, unseen. And&mdash;"
  "John Brown has disappeared!" shouted a voice from the deck. Sure enough John
  Brown was gone!</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

  <p>The Finding of the submarine boat and the dissapearance of John Brown
  caused renewed excitement among the people, and a new discovery was made. In
  relating this discovery it is necessary to relate a geographical fact:&mdash;
  At the North Pole there is supposed to exist a vast continent composed of
  volcanic soil: a portion is open to travellers and explorers but it is barren
  and unfruitful, and thus absolutely impassable. It is called "No-Mans
  Land."</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

  <p>In the extreme southern part of No-Mans Land there was found a wharf and a
  hut etc., and every sign of former human habitation. A rusty door-plate was
  nailed to the hut inscribed in old English "M. Ruello." This, then, was the
  home of Michael Ruello. the house brought to light a note-book belonging to
  John Griggs, and the log of the <i>Constitution</i> taken from Henry Johns,
  and the Madagascar reaper belong to Dahabea.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

  <p>When about to leave, they Observed a spring on the side of the hut. They
  pressed it.&mdash;A hole appeared in the side of the hut which they promptly
  entered. They were in a subterranean cavern; the beach ran down to the edge
  of a black, murky, sea; on the sea lay a dark oblong object&mdash;viz another
  submarine boat which they entered. There, bound to the cabin floor lay
  Griggs, Johns, and Dahabea, all alive and well. They, when arriving in
  London, separated, Griggs going to Ruralville, Johns, to the
  <i>Constitution</i> and Dahabea to Madagascar.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

  <p>But the mystery of John Brown lay still unsolved. So they kept strict
  watch over the port at No-Man's Land, hoping the submarine boat would arrive.
  At length, however, it did arrive bearing with it John Brown. They fixed upon
  the 5th of October for the attack. They ranged along the shore and formed
  bodies. Finally, one by one, and headed by Manuel Ruello, the pirates left
  the boat. They were (to their astonishment) met by a rapid fire.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER X. CONCLUSION</h3>

  <p>The Pirates were at length defeated and a search was made for Brown. At
  length he (the aforesaid Brown) was found. John Gregg was royally received at
  Ruralville and a dinner was [given in honour of Henry Johns].</p>

  <p>Dahabea was made King of Madagascar, and Manuel Ruello was executed at
  Newgate Prison.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER I<br>
  THE BURNS'S TOMB</h3>

  <p>It was noon in the Little village of Mainville, and a sorrowful group of
  people were standing around the Burns's Tomb. Joseph Burns was dead. (when
  dying, he had given the following strange orders:&mdash;"Before you put my
  body in the tomb, drop this ball onto the floor, at a spot marked "A"." he
  then handed a small golden ball to the rector.) The people greatly regretted
  his death. After The funeral services were finished, Mr Dobson (the rector)
  said, "My friends, I will now gratify the last wishes of the deceased. So
  saying, he descended into the tomb. (to lay the ball on the spot marked "A")
  Soon the funeral party Began to be impatient, and after a time Mr. Cha's.
  Greene (the Lawyer) descended to make a search. Soon he came up with a
  frightened face, and said, "Mr Dobson is not there"!</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER II<br>
  MYSTERIOUS MR. BELL</h3>

  <p>It was 3.10 o'clock in ye afternoone whenne The door bell of the Dobson
  mansion rang loudly, and the servant on going to the door, found an elderly
  man, with black hair, and side whiskers. He asked to see Miss Dobson. Upon
  arriving in her presence he said, "Miss Dobson, I know where your father is,
  and for &pound;10,000 I will restore him. My name is Mr. Bell." "Mr. Bell," said
  Miss Dobson, "will you excuse me from the room a moment?" "Certainly".
  replied Mr Bell. In a short time she returned, and said, "Mr. Bell, I
  understand you. You have abducted my father, and hold him for a ransom"</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER III<br>
  AT THE POLICE STATION</h3>

  <p>It was 3.20 o'clock in the afternoon when the telephone bell at the North
  End Police Station rang furiously, and Gibson, (the telephone Man) Inquired
  what was the matter,</p>

  <p>"Have found out about fathers dissapearance"! a womans voice said. "Im
  Miss Dobson, and father has been abducted, "Send King John!" King John was a
  famous western detective. Just then a man rushed in, and shouted, "Oh!
  Terrors! Come to the graveyard!"</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER IV<br>
  THE WEST WINDOW</h3>

  <p>Now let us return to the Dobson Mansion. Mr Bell was rather taken aback by
  Miss Dobson's plain speaking, but when he recovered his speech he said,
  "Don't put it quite so plain, Miss Dobson, for I&mdash;" He was interrupted
  by the entrance of King John, who with a brace of revolvers in his hands,
  barred all egress by the doorway. But quicker than thought Bell sprang to a
  west window,&mdash;and jumped.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER V<br>
  THE SECRET OF THE GRAVE</h3>

  <p>Now let us return to the station house. After the exited visitor had
  calmed somewhat, he could tell his story straighter. He had seen three men in
  the graveyard shouting "Bell! Bell! where are you old man!?" and acting very
  suspiciously. He then followed them, and they entered The Burns's Tomb! He
  then followed them in and they touched a spring at a point marked "A" and
  then Dissapeared". "I wish king John were here", Said Gibson, "What's your
  name,"? "John Spratt". replied the visitor.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER VI<br>
  THE CHASE FOR BELL</h3>

  <p>Now let us return To the Dobson Mansion again:&mdash;King John was utterly
  confounded at the Sudden movement of Bell, but when he recovered from his
  surprise, his first thought was of chase. Accordingly, he started in pursuit
  of the abductor. He tracked him down to the R. R. Station and found to his
  dismay that he had taken the train for Kent, a large city toward the south,
  and between which and Mainville there existed no telegraph or telephone. The
  train had Just Started!</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER VII<br>
  THE NEGRO HACKMAN</h3>

  <p>The Kent train started at 10.35, and about 10.36 an exited, dusty, and
  tired man* rushed into the Mainville hack. office and said to a negro hackman
  who was standing by the door&mdash;"If you can take me to Kent in 15 minutes
  I will give you a dollar". "I doan' see how I'm ter git there", said the
  negro "I hab'n't got a decent pair of hosses an' I hab&mdash;" "Two Dollars"!
  shouted The Traveller. "All right," said the Hackman.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* King John.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER VIII<br>
  BELLS SURPRISE</h3>

  <p>It was 11 o'clock at Kent, all of the stores were closed but one, a dingy,
  dirty, little shop, down at the west end. It lay between Kent Harbour, &amp;
  the Kent &amp; Mainville R.R. In the Front room a shabbily dressed person of
  doubtful age was conversing with a middle aged woman with gray haire, "I have
  agreed to do the job, Lindy," he said, "Bell will arrive at 11.30 and the
  carraige is ready to take him down to the wharf, where a ship for Africa
  sails to-nighte".</p>

  <p>"But If King John were to come?" queried "Lindy." "Then we'd get nabbed,
  an' Bell would be hung" Replied The man. Just then a rap sounded at the door
  "Are you Bell"? inquired Lindy "Yes" was the response, "And I caught the
  10.35 and King John got Left, so we are all right". At 11.40 the party
  reached The Landing, and saw a ship Loom up in the darkness. "The Kehdive"
  "of Africa" was painted on the hull, and Just as they were to step on board,
  a man stepped forward in the darkness and said "John Bell, I arrest you in
  the Queen's name"! It was King John.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER IX<br>
  THE TRIAL</h3>

  <p>The daye of The Trial had arrived, and a crowd of people had gathered
  around the Little grove, (which served for a court house in summer) To hear
  the trial of John Bell on the charge of kid-napping. "Mr. Bell," said the
  judge "what is the secret of the Burns's tomb" "I well tell you this much"
  said Bell, "If you go into the tomb and touch a certain spot marked "A" you
  will find out" "Now where is Mr Dobson"? queried the judge, "Here"! said a
  voice behind them, and The figure of Mr Dobson HIMSELF loomed up in the
  doorway. "How did you get here"!&amp;c was chorused. "'Tis a long story,"
  said Dobson.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER X<br>
  DOBSON'S STORY</h3>

  <p>"When I went down into the tomb," Said Dobson, "Everything was darkness, I
  could see nothing. but Finally I discerned the letter "A" printed in white on
  the onyx floor, I dropped the ball on the Letter, and immediately a trap-door
  opened and a man sprang up. It was this man, here," (he said (pointing at
  Bell, who stood Trembling on the prisoner's docke) "and he pulled me down
  into a brilliantly lighted, and palatial apartment where I have Lived until
  to-day. One day a young man rushed in and exclaimed "The secret Is revealed!"
  and was gone. He did not see me. Once Bell left his key behind, and I took
  the impression in wax, and the next day was spent in filing keys to fit the
  Lock. The next day my key fitted. and the next day (which is to-day) I
  escaped."</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XI<br>
  THE MYSTERY UNVEILED</h3>

  <p>"Why did the late J. Burns, ask you to put the ball there"? (at "A"?)
  queried the Judge? "To get me into trouble" replied Dobson "He, and Francis
  Burns, (his brother) have plotted against me for years, and I knew not, in
  what way they would harm me". "Sieze Francis Burns"! yelled the Judge.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XII<br>
  CONCLUSION</h3>

  <p>Francis Burns, and John Bell, were sent to prison for life. Mr Dobson was
  cordially welcomed by his daughter, who, by the way had become Mrs King John.
  "Lindy" and her accomplice were sent to Newgate for 30 days as aidors and
  abbettors of a criminal escape.</p>

  <p>"Now be good children," said Mrs. Lee "While I am away and don't get into
  mischief." Mr. and Mrs. Lee were going off for the day and to leave the two
  children John, 10 years old, and Alice 2 years old. "Yes," replied John.</p>

  <p>As Soon as the elder Lees were away the younger Lees went down [into the]
  cellar and began to rummage among the rubbish. Little Alice leaned against
  the wall, watching John. As John was making a boat of barrel staves the
  Little girl gave a piercing cry as the bricks behind her crumbled away. He
  rushed up to her and lifted her out screaming loudly. As soon as her screams
  subsided she said "the wall went away."</p>

  <p>John went up and saw that there was a passage he said to the little girl
  "lets come and see what this is."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, [and] they entered the place. They could stand up [in]
  it. The passage was farther than they could see. John went back upstairs and
  went to the kitchen drawer and got two candles and some matches and then they
  went back to the cellar passage. The two once more entered. There was
  plastering on the walls, ceiling and floor. Nothing was visible but a box.
  This was for a seat. Nevertheless they examined it and found it to contain
  nothing. They walked on farther and pretty soon the plastering left off and
  they were in a cave. Little Alice was frightened at first but at her brothers
  assurance that it was "all right" she allayed her fears. soon they came to a
  small box, which John took up and carried. Within pretty soon they came on a
  boat. In it were two oars. He dragged it with difficulty along with him. Soon
  they found the passage came to an abrupt stop. He pulled the obstacle away
  and to his dismay water rushed in in torrents. John was an expert swimmer and
  long breather. He had just taken a breath, so he tried to rise, but with the
  box and his sister he found it quite impossible. Then he caught sight of the
  boat rising [and] he grasped it...</p>

  <p>The next he knew he was on the surface, clinging tightly to the body of
  his sister and the mysterious box. He could not imagine how the water got in
  but a new peril menaced them. If the water continued rising it would rise to
  the top. suddenly a thought presented itself. He could shut off the water. He
  speedily did this and, lifting the now lifeless body of his sister into the
  boat, he himself clim[b]ed in and sailed down the passage. It was gruesome
  and uncanny [and] absolutely dark. His candle being put out by the flood and
  a dead body lying near, he did not gaze about him but rowed for his life.
  When he did look up he was floating in his own cellar. He quickly rushed up
  stairs with the body to find his parents had come home. He told them the
  story.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The funeral of Alice occupied so much time that John quite forgot about
  the box;but when they did open it they found it to be a solid gold chunk
  worth about $10,000&mdash;enough to pay for anything but the death of his
  sister.</p>

  <p>"Heave to, there&rsquo;s something floating to the leeward." the speaker
  was a short stockily built man whose name was William Jones. he was the
  captain of a small cat boat in which he and a party of men were sailing at
  the time the story opens.</p>

  <p>"Aye aye sir," answered John Towers and the boat was brought to a stand
  still Captain Jones reached out his hand for the object which he now
  discerned to be a glass bottle "Nothing but a rum flask that the men on a
  passing boat threw over," he said but from an impulse of curiosity he reached
  out for it. it was a rum flask and he was about to throw it away when he
  noticed a piece of paper in it. He pulled it out and on it read the
  following</p>

  <p class="letter">Jan 1, 1864<br>
  I am John Jones who writes this letter my ship is fast sinking with a
  treasure on board I am where it is marked * on the enclosed chart...</p>

  <p>Captain Jones turned the sheet over, and the other side was a
  chart.</p><br>

  <div align="center">

         title="Chart">
  </div><br>

  <p>On the edge were written these words: <i>"dotted lines represent course we
  took."</i></p>

  <p>"Towers," Said Capt. Jones exitedly "read this." Towers did as he was
  directed "I think it would pay to go," said Capt. Jones "do you?" "Just as
  you say," replied Towers. "We&rsquo;ll charter a schooner this very day,"
  said the exited captain "All right," said Towers so they hired a boat and
  started off guided by the dotted lines of they chart. In four weeks the
  reached the place where directed and the divers went down and came up with an
  iron bottle they found in it the following lines scribbled on a piece of
  brown paper</p>

  <p class="letter">Dec 3, 1880<br>
  Dear Searcher excuse me for the practical joke I have played on you but it
  serves you right to find nothing for your foolish act&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Well it does," said Capt Jones "go on..."</p>

  <p class="letter">However I will defray your expenses to &amp; from the place
  you found your bottle I think it will be $2,500.00, so that amount you will
  find in an iron box. I know where you found the bottle because I put this
  bottle here &amp; the iron box &amp; then found a good place to put the
  second bottle. Hoping the enclosed money will defray your expenses some, I
  close&mdash;Anonymus."</p>

  <p>"I&rsquo;d like to kick his head off," said Capt Jones "Here diver go and
  get the $2,500.00 in a minute the diver came up bearing an iron box inside it
  was found $2,500.00 It defrayed their expenses but I hardly think that they
  will ever go to a mysterious place as directed by a mysterious bottle.</p>
